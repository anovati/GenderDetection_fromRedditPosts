Gianlel,short,1390307127.0,"I used to date them when I was shorter, now I'm in a relationship so I'm not into the dating scene, but if I were I probably wouldn't anymore; it only annoys me when they state that they can't date shorter men but if I say the opposite they get pissed off."
nutrecht,cscareerquestions,1390307152.0,Really depends on your role. If you're a webdeveloper you need to know how to get the stuff you developer installed and running on for example Linux and know how to debug problems you encounter. But if you're a Linux SysOp you'll probably need to know a lot more about the OS. If you're on the other hand a device driver developer you'll have to know everthing about the kernel.

Given a complete enough understanding of the brain-body interactions, it would be possible to alter someone's personality, and by extension, their sexuality and any other aspect of that person's mental state.

While, it might seem morally wrong to alter someone in that manner, you could concievably fix numerous medical conditions like schizophrenia or MPD with little effort.

Thankfully, we're decades, even centuries, away from that level of knowledge, so it's not a moral dilemma we have to deal with now.

Now, I'm so scared of having her I just want to be pregnant forever. 

Normal ♥

&gt;I am scared because diapers are expensive even though we can afford them just fine. 

Yeah and while they are expensive... in the long run... that expense is spread out over time!

&gt;Labor is going to hurt and I know it.

Sure.  But the pain will go away. Every time a contraction ends, the pain will go away. The moment the baby is born, the pain will go away.

&gt;I've had a miscarriage and an I medicated D&amp;C, so I want to have a painless c section and be done, but logically I know vaginally is best.

Well a ""painless c section"" doesnt exactly equate to a painless recovery. 

&gt;I'm terrified to have to take care of her. 

It will be okay, and if it isnt, there are people there to help you.

&gt;I've been sleeping so much lately, what if I hate her for taking away my sleep?

If this happens get help because it is a sign of postpartum depression. And it is not because you are a vad person or a bad mom. It is something that can be fixed and you dont have to feel this way.

 &gt;How am I ever going to have time for my dog and school?

You'll have plenty of time. Women in all of history have still had time for whatever (other kids, spouse, pets, school, work, hobbies) when they wanted it.

&gt; My belly is going from this cute perfect bump and I know it's going to be flappy. 

Well at first sure. But that tends to go away. Especially in first time moms.

&gt;This is so petty I know. 

Its not petty. You are afraid of the unknown. This is a very common, normal and understandable fear.

&gt;I'm scared basically of how bad labor is, 

Aka the unknown. Yes, it sucks. But the worst part is not knowing if youll be that 50 hour labor that ends up with a c section anyway that you are probably fearing you will be, or the 21 hour labor (most of which is early, manageable labor) with almost no issues that statistically you are most likely to be, or that 4 hour labor where you barely make it to the hospital before baby falls out without you having to push yourself. All of which are possible.

&gt;how my body is going to change,

Again...Fear of the unknown. You just have to trust that its not going to suddenly become hideously disfigured or jabba the hutt because you have done nothing to cause that.

&gt;and how hard newborns are. 

And fear of the unknown. For the most part... the hardest part is feeding them. Otherwise newborns sleep almost all the time (provided they dont have reflux or colic or some other medical issue going on, in which case consult your doctor)



Youre going to be a great mom. Because you worry. And worrying means you care. And the biggest part of being a good mom is caring enough to do the best for your child. ♥"

Because she was underage and didn't have a job, her baby daddy's parents got custody of the child. Since I met her physically, I never knew she had an online profile also I have never used an online dating website. While we were dating she was still talking to this dude who eventually used this kid as his bait. Apparently she became ""friends"" with him on Facebook and that's where the kid pictures came. He would tell her that he would get a great lawyer to fight for the child and fed her all this bullshit that wasn't true. So she was getting jerked emotionally along with the whole fake band thing.

I can tell you that since we had such a small town/school, there weren't the traditional cliques that most bigger schools have. Of course there were groups that did different activities (sports, debate clubs, religious meetings, etc...), but no one was ""hated on"" for what they did. I had close friends that were more into music theory and band than sports, but that was fine. Ashley and I actually got together by chance. We were both at the library, her for pleasure reading and me for studying. She was in the same world history class as me so I just asked her for some help. Things progressed from there.

Everyone knew Keith was strange, but like I said no one was mean or nasty to him. He didn't do a lot of school activities with anyone but he was also never outwardly hostile. Just shy, bit of a loner. He and Ashley dated for a while and she said that his quietness was attractive. Felt they got along well enough.

I agree that it takes a deliberate effort to keep the relationship strong, because it would be easy to get sucked into baby stuff. But it's also easy to get sucked into work for some people, or to fall into a boring routine even without kids. 

I think every long term relationship will run into a time when it feels kinda dull or different, and needs to be refreshed somehow.

Oddly, my husband and I have gotten along really well since having our daughter, and we rarely even bicker about stupid stuff these days. We do take time out for each other, and we have interests outside of the baby even though we are both crazy about her. I'm sure it won't always be this easy but we're committed to each other and to keeping our relationship alive and thriving.

Engineering is all that stuff that seems ridiculously broad in scope. That is the foundation that all engineering science is built upon. You can't understand the subjects that comes with the specific discipline until you have that base.

Engr isn't like other subjects, in the sense that you can't just regurgitate a bunch of facts or plug-and-chug your way through every problem. Grad school will not be like that, even if undergrad seems that way. You have to go through the motions until they become instinctual."

ulvok_coven,books,1390310500.0,"No. Humbert doesn't need to be lying about it. Part of the point of the book, at least IMO, is that seduction is not external, not something someone does to you, it's internal, something that you do. Humbert is very much attracted to, maybe in love with Lolita, but more because of sexual proclivities and his solipsistic attitude than her actual personality or intent. He might be telling the truth - Lolita definitely sought his attention - but the two of them have different understandings of relationships, and his dominates and turns out badly for her.

In addition, I think he's unreliable, but he's a shitty pick for this list. The author wants to despise and distrust him for pedo-panic reasons, not because he actually deserves it. If you really try reading from his perspective, his narration is only slightly problematic. There are better choices for this list. His status as a narrator is virtually unrelated to the story of Lolita.

EDIT: Also, if what you got from the book is 'pedos are bad,' you might actually have the brain of a chimpanzee, and not a person. I would suggest discussing this with your doctor."

Feudalism is compelled work for the profit of central figures, who provide some services of their own, but don't really provide capital in the same sense. A lord is not a capitalist for two reasons - the work is involuntary and the lord provides the value of defense and organization. Capitalism is an economy based around hiring voluntarily for profit, where the capitalist has no need to add any value to a product to make money off of it, they just supply capital.

A few years ago, the artist became a born again feminist.  The lead female character cut most of her hair off, stopped being the attention whore sex symbol she protrayed herself to be, and instead started the fight agains the male oppression.  Soon after, the artist introduced more women to the comic and all of them were strong womyn leading the charge against the misogynistic patriarchy.  

After the guy in question got a cookie for not oppressing women, he started to realize that he was the problem and started making an effort to stop being misogynistic and sexist.  The shadow is supposed to be his darkside, the misogyny that is inherent in all men.  In his mirror world, it continues it's oppressing ways by visiting strip clubs and looking at porn.  Since the guy has spent most of his comic life being a sexist douche, trying to change is difficult for him, so he is constantly looking for approval for what he feels is a big deal to him.  All the women of course, look down in disdain at him and his efforts, because he is, well, male.  Essentially, his actions are made to be pavlovian since he is constantly trying to get that ""cookie"" instead of making the change for the right reasons.

It's a shame that the artist decided to make his comic so strongly feminist.  I enjoyed reading it for the longest time, but the writing has become so painful to read most of the time.  It's obvious the artist has a lot of male guilt and sef-loathing issues he is trying to work out.  I don't know what happened to make him make such a radical change in his comic, but it's getting boring.  I expect him to introduce vegans any day now."

A different situation then Syria, though-- Assad proved himself to be pretty nasty but the only pro-genocide people in Syria are firmly in the ""Islamic Front"" and the JAN and ISIS.

&gt; Also it's ironic criticising radical religious people when Assad's key allies are the Iranian theocracy, Hezbollah and Shi'a militias.

Iran as it is especially now is one of those countries that's been changing slowly over the years and has a large capability for further mutability.

Which isn't to say that Khomeinism has evaporated-- just that they're certainly not the only entity there is in Iranian politics, and that the worst sort of Khomeinists certainly don't have everything their own way, by any standard.

Which isn't to say that places like Qatar or the UAE are dominated by the worst sorts of Sunni Islamists, either. Both seem to be very based around the ""how much money you have determines what you get to do here/money talks"".

&gt; Also it's ironic criticising radical religious people when Assad's key allies are the Iranian theocracy, Hezbollah and Shi'a militias.

Already addressed the Iran connection-- it's disingenuous to say the least to claim that Hezbollah resembles the worst of the black flag jihadi/takfiri groups in any way whatsoever, and as for the Shi'a militias-- I suppose their ideologies do vary somewhat, but I've yet to hear of them setting up flogging campaigns or cutting people's heads off and sticking them on spikes.

The solution is to realize that reddit isn't just one group.  It feels that way, and that's what's deceiving about it.  But comments from individuals and downvotes don't represent society at large.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,BodyAcceptance,1390312935.0,"Actually...that was really insightful. I'd never thought of it that way. I hesitate to use the word ""victim"" so freely but looking at it that way, I can definitely see how our culture's obsessive fat shaming affects women of all shapes and sizes. And even more than this, the sort of prejudice that leads people to give fat people shit about being fat also leads people to give skinny women shit for being ""too skinny"". No matter what you look like, you can't win - someone will be there to judge you. Even if your body is ideal there will be someone judging you for being vain, shallow, stuck-up, etc. It's ridiculous.

I do think it's something women can change, though, because in my experience, the vast bulk of body shaming I've ever received has been from other women. I can count on one hand the number of guys who have judged my body and found it lacking. I think if we all agreed to get off this ride, we would make a *huge* difference where body image is concerned."

Explain to me how he has equal power as someone in Likud or another Israeli Jewish party.

&gt; The Bloc Quebecois had 51 seats in Parliament but were still incapable of accomplishing their nationalist, confessional goals. The same operates in Israel. There is nothing unique or insidious about the arrangement.

This is why I shouldn't take you seriously.

&gt; Your argument that they are 'very marginalized' is incomprehensible given that they are accorded full civil rights, can learn and fully function in their language, fully express and practice their religious beliefs, etc.

So everyone who says that the civil rights of Palestinians in Israel are seen as easily disposable and are often trampled on are lying? That's what you're saying?

Then you state that the jews have ""graciously"" allowed Palestinians to speak Palestinian Arabic and have mosques or churches? 

Is this sort of like the ""Israelis are exceptional and should be lauded because they allow the nasty Palestinians into Israeli hospitals""?

&gt; Honestly, you appear to be speaking from a pre-ordained conclusion. The facts fly in the face of your arguments. Being part of a minority group in a democracy is miles away from living under Apartheid and is a blatantly agenda-driven hyperbole.

aDDnTN,motorcycles,1390313811.0,"ok, let's put you in the moment:

you're on the throttle, winding open, and find yourself in need of more speed and less revs. So you ease off the throttle, rapidly matching revs with where there will be in the next gear at the current speed. before you get to or below that rpm, gently toe the shifter upwards, keep pressure on the lever and then give it some gas and it should pop right in and off you go.

imo, don't do this while lugging or at low rpm (think mids or higher). it could pop back out or cause some trans issues after doing it for a while. But plenty of guys do it on their bikes at whatever point they want, so ymmv.

Regular people get some ups and downs and moodswings too. 

The thing that distinguishes ours is more of the *range* they go to. So, if it's outside a *reasonable* range, then yeah, it's probably the bipolar... 

But if it's inside a certain range, it just might be that it's simply... Normal emotional response to external stimulus. 

So, you're bummed about some stress you experienced during the weekend... Seems pretty normal to me to get a bit down or grumpy... But. Bipolar tends to be the range where it's like, ""My friends cancelled their plans and maybe they truly hate me, the world would be better without me, maybe I should kill myself.""... Normal tends to be the range where ""My friends cancelled on me and they've done it a few times now, I think maybe I'll give them a couple more chances but it feels like they're trying to drop me and it really sucks, I hate losing friends and now I have to work and that sucks too""... 

And while, yeah, you'd rather not go on your work trip, maybe having to direct some of your energy into trip planning instead of spending energy worrying about whatever happened on the weekend has been enough to lift you out of your funk.

Renner1,canada,1390314207.0,"&gt; . This is a state traumatized by near constant violence

What is Palestine, in that regard?

The Palestinians are, far more accurately, a people traumatized by ""near constant violence"" at the hands of the Israelis. Sorry if that goes against your narrative.

&gt; and among the older Israelis prejudice is deep,

Actually I read that a lot of the ""military age"" Israelis are some of the worst ones as far as prejudice is concerned. Most racially motivated, or something similar.

&gt;  but you're severely mistaken if you believe the vast majority is against the peace process 

That's interesting, because all I see, from Israelis and the expatriate Jewish community, is a tendency to bitch and moan about ""the Palestinians not wanting/not understanding peace"" or ""the Arabs are against the peace process"", and these statements flying in the face of reality.

The ball is in Israel's court, as far as the peace process goes. They've been screwing around since 1993, showing that they're not actually interested in peace-- I wonder what  standard of peace process these supposed legions of Israelis in favour of the peace process have?"

saikron,truegaming,1390314779.0,"Two things: marketing and games. 

Many people, even people that frequent r/truegaming, didn't even realize the Wii U was a new console if all of the commends I just read are to be believed. I remember seeing a Wii commercial once a day, but I have not seen a single Wii U commercial. Print ads usually feature the gamepad to the point where if people have heard of a Wii U, half the time they think its a tablet for the Wii that costs $300.

In contrast, I have an unhealthy enthusiasm for video games, so I followed the Wii U launch as closely as I did the last two generations of launches for Sony and MS. I thought the console was neat with a competitive price for including a tablet and some decent hardware, but I figured that the Nintendo shop and system software would suck about as much as it did on the Wii, and from what I've read those assumptions were correct. I decided I would wait for a handful of games that I wanted to play were out.

Well here we are, going on 18 months later, and we are about to total, what like 3 games I am interested in playing? One of which has a TBA 2014 release. 4 games if you count doubling down on MHTri.

If Nintendo is honestly doing their best to turn out good games ASAP under the Nintendo brand, I think it's high time they turned over some of that work to quality 3rd parties. If I were them I would retain a veto option to refuse to sell the game, and I would just keep funding 3rd party projects with Nintendo IP until we got one that I thought I could sell that wouldn't dilute the brand.

Also, what is stopping them from hiring a bunch of translators to bring great JP games to the english speaking world? Fucks sake, I wouldn't put it past Nintendo to try and sell me MHTri ""Ultra""HD before they outsource the translating for the latest MH."

Renner1,canada,1390315593.0,"&gt; Well, the 76 million lives in Iran are governed by a Supreme leader who relies on a religious doctrine whereby clerics representing the lost Mahdi have ultimate control. Their law is derived by Shariah, and is particularly brutal for women and homosexuals (homosexuals being worthy of capital punishment for the mere act of existence). So I would definitely say that thepoliticator is not exercising hyperbole in that department.

Iran during the worst years of the extreme religious puritanism that characterized hard Khomeinism-- during the 1980's probably the worst manifestation of it. That much is true.

""thepoliticator"" is trying to claim that the Middle East is ""characterized"" by entities extolling hard shariah, which isn't factual. A sensational, non-factual claim and some idiotic baiting-- ""go live in the Middle East under Shariah law""-- which leads me to assume that much of what he says isn't worth very much.

&gt;  The same cannot be said for Iranians or Saudi Arabians (perfect examples of the brutal state of the Middle East). 

You're really no better, though, are you? 

&gt; I agree with thepoliticator that defending these regressive regimes is on the wrong side of history, however you may feel about Israel.

The best part was no one was defending Wahhabist or Khomeinist views on society or how society should be run.

It was, at best, a poor attack in response to someone claiming that Harper sucking up to Israel was placing Canada on the wrong side of history-- so some dimbulb had to break out ""oh yeah you must support hard shariah and everyone in the middle east does""."

Estre,Norway,1390315658.0,"I taught myself, basically, have never taken a class. I basically just did a bunch of different things:

* Read a lot. For example easy articles the first few months (www.klartale.no). Read articles linked on /r/norge. Read the comments too.

* Watch movies with Norwegian dubs or subtitles. I looked at the back of every DVD I own to see if they were available, and to my surprise in many cases they were.

* A LOT of Norwegian friends. I asked a ton of questions. I had them give me translation exercises. I practiced chatting constantly. I asked the differences between similar words. 

* There are other places you can ask questions as well: /r/norsk, the group ""Ja, jeg snakker litt norsk"" on Facebook, etc. Take full advantage of this, I think that all my questions made the biggest difference for me, and if I didn't quite understand something, I'd keep on trying to find out the answer and other explanations until it clicked.

* Norwegian radio (the app TuneIn lets you look for what you're interested in whatever language, I found that helpful)

* Practice vocabulary on www.memrise.com. I actually have 5 lists I made myself of Norwegian vocabulary and phrases, though I have used many others as well. Whenever I learn a new word, I'll add it there so I can practice it again in a few hours, then a couple days, and so on until I know it inside and out.

* I got a grammar book, which was pretty helpful.

* I practiced writing at lang-8.com and got corrections from native speakers, sometimes even full blown explanations of why what I wrote was wrong.

* Had a language exchange with several people to practice speaking and listening. Because of dialects this part can be pretty tricky.

* There are also a few youtube channels where you can find some interesting explanations or get practice. This guy has a lot of helpful ones, for instance: http://www.youtube.com/user/Thirduncle1

You've got a huge advantage here in that you actually live in a place where the language is spoken and have a relationship with someone who speaks the language, so take advantage of that. If you see an advertisement and don't understand it, for example, write down the word to look it up later. The next few times you see that advertisement it'll reinforce the memory in your mind so that word becomes part of your passive and later active vocabulary. Ask your girlfriend a lot of questions, too.

However, do be sensitive to the fact that it's hard and can be tiring teaching a language, so don't rely solely on your girlfriend to teach you. She can be a big help, but most of the work and effort should come from you. Ask other friends to give you a hand too if you can.

Feel free to ask if you have more questions about teaching yourself Norwegian. Lykke til!"

I heard once that you shouldn't turn in until you can see the apex and the exit point, then turn in and line them up. obviously this isn't possible for every corner/curve, but true enough that delaying turn as long as possible gives you the most information before committing.

What side of the road is normal in your country? left (like england) or right (like america)? Probably right hand side, judging by your original statement. It's mostly visibility and you are smart to yield to your instincts, because your sight is more limited around those turns. Ride in your envelope and don't push yourself out of it to ""gain achievements"" or ""get over some type of bar"" you currently  think is necessary.

it's all in your head anyway.

which is the same for TF. TF is a survival instinct that has been useful for humans (mammals, or even sighted life forms in general?). But on a motorcycle it becomes DEADLY, like just about every other instinct you have.

you need to be capable of *instantly acknowledging that you have become fixed on a target you wish to avoid, breaking that lock, moving your eyes to where they need to be, and rotating your neck to look around the corner, which will bring your shoulders around and make the bike turn true and steady. 

imo, one of the hardest skills to develop is the ""rolling eyes"" or constantly moving eyes, where you constantly move your focus point ahead of the bike around a corner until you line up on your exit point. Try practicing in interstate loop/jughandle ramps. Watch out for the sneaky decreasing radius turns that get tighter as you go further along (or just tighten up all of a sudden at the end)."

YarLady,AskReddit,1390316048.0,"He picked me up at my place. I couldn't believe he was actually nervous. But, so was I.


As we drove to our destination, a song from a decade old, somewhat obscure folk singer came on. I named the artist and mentioned how much I loved the album. He nearly wrecked the car in shock that I'd known who it was. We talked about music for an hour over drinks at a cozy bar before heading off to dinner.


We discussed our favorite books and past travels over dinner with never an awkward moment's pause. We decided to go dancing, he was fantastic, I was not, but it didn't stop him from teaching me a thing or two. Things got pretty heated on the dance floor so we decided to take a walk to cool off a bit.


We walked through the city showing each other our favorite spots talking through the night. He pulled me into an alley, pressing me against the wall for our first kiss. The thought of it still gives me butterflies. When we realized how late it had gotten, we went down to the water and watched the sun come up.


Best date ever. I was on a euphoria high for days.Totally traditional, and not unlike many dates I'd had before or since in terms of activities. But in all honesty, I've never connected with another person like that in so short a period of time."

ThatCrankyGuy,gadgets,1390316073.0,"Well it's not just idiocy that's the problem. The ergonomics of the phone dictates that it'd be taller than wide, such that it is comfortable to grip and feels as natural as possible in our hands. So that becomes it's default orientation. When you are recording a video it becomes very unnatural to let go of the default orientation and hold it side ways to record horizontally. 

Now phone manufacturers can record horizontally like this app does but as this app demonstrates that means losing considerable amount of view-finder area, which makes previewing what you're recording difficult.

So it is a problem and it's not easy to solve. I'm afraid not everything can be solved by technology -- something simply require changing the habits of your customers."

Renner1,canada,1390316108.0,"&gt; I don't think anyones boycotting the Iranian or Persian carpet store down the street in Ottawa or Toronto

So you are denying the fact that Iran has had numerous boycotts and sanctions placed on it, most often to the glee of pro-Israel and Jewish groups?

&gt; The same cannot be said for Jewish boycotts orchestrated by groups such as Israeli Apartheid Week.

Boo fucking hoo. I get that you'd rather have a ""Israel is the light"" week, but shit happens. There's more reason to boycott Israeli and Jewish products, I think, then there is to boycott Iranian or Persian products. 

Israel obviously doesn't give a shit about international law, and has no problem advocating wide scale sanctions or boycotts against other countries-- I don't see you complaining about this, or actually taking into account why people are talking about boycotting Israeli products.

Also-- take into account that Iranian expatriates, in general, will have a very wide range of opinions of the situation in Iran and Iran's place in the world. The vast majority are against the idea of sanctioning or boycotting Iran, but by no means do Iranian expatriates necessarily see themselves as connected to Iran on all levels.

I have yet to hear of an Israeli or Jewish business or organization that doesn't  unequivocally support Israel in some way-- some of the non-Israeli Jews are the very worst in terms of their partisanism and anti-Palestinian bile."

Yes, I am extremely blessed in the friends-department. I've had the same group of girl friends since I was 16 and we're a very strong support system together.

AwesomeLandia,personalfinance,1390316175.0,"I do miss bathroom breaks.  Sometimes, I fantasize about what a boring job in a cubicle would bring me: water cooler breaks (I've seen them on Dilbert), long lunches when I can talk to my coworkers about non work related stuff, bathroom breaks as needed, replying to email right away, and wearing heels (not easy if you're walking and standing all day).  I think y'all can also take your vacations in the off season, right?  I'd love to travel in the fall when it is cheaper.  

However, aside from the cubicle thing being BORING, there are a lot of plusses to my job.  Yes, there is the happy hello from a current or former student.  That's just the tip of the iceberg.  
* There are the visits from past students (and I only expect to get more as I continue in my career-- so far only 4 years at this site).    
* I also meet a lot of grateful parents.  Sure, there are parent jerks (just like in every other aspect of humanity), but most parents are very happy that I am helping their son or daughter.  These parents treat me with respect and are eager to help their child at home.  I get to be part of the parent-teacher team to help raise a happy, healthy, educated child.  
* There's the general respect and awe I get from strangers when I tell them I'm a teacher.  Yes, I've had people buy me drinks at the bar and give me high-fives.  
* I get an awesome teacher discount at some stores, even if it's not for my classroom.  
* For Christmas, birthdays, and just because, I receive a treasure trove of the most beautiful, kid-crafted cards and gifts that rival the collection of any grandma or grandpa.  
* I get filled with pride when I see my students master a concept that I taught.  I am overwhelmed when I see them teach that same concept to their peers.  
* I get to be part of a profession that encourages us to be life long learners.  I work with people who are constantly thinking, questioning, researching, doing, and reflecting.  There are no vacant lots amongst my colleagues.  
* I work with a beautiful diversity of people.  Every child must attend school-- this includes the kids who love reading and those who don't.  This includes the loud and the quiet, the shy and the brave.  It includes the skaters and the dancers and the football players and the poets.  I meet funny kids and boring kids and everyone in between.  I imagine that in a cubicle, I'd be surrounded by people who are just like me (say, computer programmers).  School is one of the only places you'll see so many different personalities mingling together.  
* I get to play.  As a middle school teacher, I can sing, dance, act funny, run, shoot hoops, and high-five to my heart's content.  No, I don't teach P.E.  It's just good practice to get kids out of their seats, and to approach the lesson from different angles (learning styles).  
* I don't have to sit in one place all day.  In fact, I get a good amount of healthy walking in every day.
* My office has a window.  
* I get free professional development through my district.  
* I get to talk to people all day (I'm a people-person, so this is a strong plus).  
* Field trips are pretty great.  
* I get to be a ""proud parent"" every year at promotion/ graduation.  
* I am influencing young people and hopefully, by doing this, I am creating a better world for tomorrow.  

In financial terms, I could be paid more.  I'd love to be able to afford a house and to see my loans vanish.  In teaching, there are some tough times.  I won't lie about that.  I have almost quit (my first two years of teaching were at two separate schools with the one-year layoff policy).  There are some teachers who should not be teachers, these folks make us look bad and make our jobs harder.  There are some kids who are so hurt and angry that they act in ways that make others hurt and angry.  **Days can be long and painful.  But... they can also be great.  Working as a teacher you will have the hardest, longest days.  You will cry.  Sometimes, these will be tears of joy.  Sometimes the pain is from seeing a child walk across the graduation stage and go on into a new life.  Sometimes the longest days are the ones that end with two hours of tutoring and a slight smile from a student who has just gotten it.**"

So you don't borrow someone else's money to pay for your toys, because boys tend to break their toys, and you don't want to be owing someone money for a broken toy. Likewise, from the bank perspective, if your investment (the debt held)  isn't worth what you loaned, it isn't something you can take from the debtor, in the event they decide to stop paying. that is also why you can get a better rate from the bank on a car, than a motorcycle.

plus, banks have a hard time collecting debt from dead men, so they are not wont to loan them money for something they might die on."

Medijoke,AskReddit,1390316937.0,"Similar experience sans the 23 years. I had to move back to my home state during college, so there is a couple of hour discrepancy. Anyways, I learn my friend is having a big birthday party, and I saw it as a good chance to go back and see all of my friends, as home was incredibly boring.

So I drive down there, hang out with a couple of my friends, and go to the party. I drank, played around, and had an awesome time visiting. I wasn't on the prowl to pick up a girl or anything. But of course right when you fucking know it, I make some dumb comment about linguistics(my maor) and this gorgeous girl turns to me and smiles. 

The night was a haze after that. We talked the entire night, nerding out on Star Trek, the various languages we knew, and random other peculiar stuff that I had never managed to connect before with someone. We passed out in the living room holding hands.

I had to drive back to my hometown the next day - 2 and a half months before I would be back at the college. I barely snagged her number before I left. That summer we somehow kept contact, and one day I even drove back to go on a date with her. Stayed up until 4 in the morning and then slept in the back of my car. Incredible.

About 7 months later we're still together and best friends.

I really hate that ""the only way to prevent rape is to keep women away from places where it occurs"" is still a viable way to deal with rape. Women are raped everywhere they go. On the street, in the movies, at bars, in their own home. We would have no place to go if that was the only way to prevent rape.

Also, a lot of rapists don't see themselves as rapists. ""She was asking for it"" comes to mind, as well as college guys having sex with black out drunk or unconscious girls. Most of these guys don't think they've done anything wrong, but will still claim that all rape is bad. There is more than one kind of (potential) rapist and not all of them are evil and corrupted by nature. Some just need education and guidance."

wanderingstar625,AskWomen,1390317127.0,"I kind of love this question. I'm only most of the way through my 20's but I want to play!

20 - Started out in college, engaged, in love, very happy. Working a grunt job in the summer to get some spending cash, just happy as a clam.

21 - Moved into my first apartment with my fiance although I was still going to school. Lots of happy happy happy, in love, enjoying my newfound freedom and ""adulthood"" 

22 - Commence breakup. Literally, as I was turning 22. Commence depression. Graduate college, get my big girl job, start my career, start turning things around.

23 - Job offers me an opportunity to relocate across the country. SCORE! Buy my first house in my new location. 

24 - Focus more on work and my horses. No time for relationships. 

25 - Hard work pays off - got a promotion at work and became a national champion equestrian! 

26 - Job situation has become depressing. The promotion ended up making me hate my ""new"" job. I'd been promised a lot of changes and opportunity and none of them came to pass.

So, I quit my current job (last day is in ONE WEEK!) as I've gotten a new job about 3 hours away, much closer to my horse trainer (and all the things that make me happy). New job, new industry, selling my first house. 

I didn't travel too much - but I traveled so much as a kid that it was never a priority.

I accomplished a lot of my goals, but I really do wish that I could have found someone to start a family with. I'm feeling like the clock is ticking. I know 27 isn't ""old"", but I want to be done with babymaking before I'm 30. That's looking less and less likely.

Great friendships... eh. Here and there. I'm a wanderer, a traveler, I relocate a lot. Some people stick around, some don't. Right now I have my barn family and they're some of the closest friends I've ever had.

I can honestly say I've learned more in the years after my breakup with my fiance than I did in the years with him. That was a huge part of my life. I've accepted more responsibility for things in the last year than I ever did while we were together. Some of the non-serious relationships I've had here and there have really been more enlightening about what kind of partner I am and what mistakes I make.

I thought I landed my dream job once. I had a dream job for a while. Now hopefully I'll have it again.

I moved out twice and about to move on yet again! I moved from Missouri to Wyoming to Texas, and now relocating within TX.

I technically graduated on time, but in 4.5 years instead of 4. Junior college usually adds a semester, but it was totally worth it.

I also got in the best shape of my life and started eating far healthier the last year and a half. I seriously consider this to be my biggest accomplishment so far. "
Kagrenasty,AskReddit,1390317143.0,"I guess I have two.

I had a girl that I dated for a little while who was from Connecticut and we went ice skating by the Smithsonian.  There's something really fun about ice skating with a woman.  I can ""skate"" but I'm no hockey player or figure skater.

It was fun having her coach me into being more confident, showing me how to go backwards, holding hands and all that jazz.  The lights were beautiful and everyone was laughing/happy/etc.  Then we walked to Chinatown and had drinks.

The first dinner date with my fiance was also really fun.  We had dinner at Jackie's in Silver Spring and ended up somehow at the ""chef's table"", which meant that the head chef would be preparing something for us, free of charge, to try.  I felt like a baller and she was impressed.  We ended up just talking for hours and hours and ended up at her place.  

We were talking about something and she was kind of perched on the couch.  She kept leaning closer, and closer, and closer and got this look in her eye.

AKA_Sotof,europe,1390317445.0,"&gt;To most of your above post, I offer a quote from Edmund Burke:

&gt;""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.""

&gt;Whilst you might interpret such a quote as ""Therefore, we must combat 'evil' cultural differences!"", I take more of an interpretation in favour of ""To do nothing in a time of inequalities is to maintain such inequalities"". Whilst to do nothing is to ""normalise"" the issue, such may not be favourable insofar as inequalities still exist (and trust me when I say, dabbling even a little bit into the statistics shows that inequalities do exist - you, yourself, point at differences in culture to explain this).

So you can quote things. Bravo. Please come back with an actual argument because this is not one. There is a point where you have to stop hunting witches otherwise you will start killing innocent people as you already killed all the witches. 

&gt;A culture of vengeance may not be good, however, believe it or not, but the idea of assimilation also isn't seen as the most effective view, and certainly not something that you can force with legislation (on the contrary, to most sociologists I've read of who've studied the topic, trying to force people to integrate has a counterproductive effect in causing them to intergrate even less and become even more culturally defensive - Steve Bruce is the name of the first Sociologist who springs to mind).

&gt;As for the idea of ""assimilation"", I champion the Canadian ""cultural mosaic"" over the Western ""melting pot""; the former actually supporting the coexistence of different cultures rather than forcing them all to be the same. Such success is apparent when you look at crime statistics etc. - there's claims, for instance, that Toronto has one of the lowest crime rates in North America, for instance.

It does not matter if it is the most effective way. The end result we want is not a powderkeg of many different cultures. We want the nation as homogenic as possible because that is when it is most efficient.

&gt;And, thus, we see your cultural ignorance, from an inherently Western, secular viewpoint. Their religion may not be ""real"" to you, but it certainly is to them, which explains why they were offended. A similar analogy would be (although I'm not sure if it has the same meaning in Denmark as the UK) that I wouldn't be able to burn a poppy or anything resembling a poppy (resemblant of soldiers) without causing such mass-riots (and trust me when I say, I have seen someone do so, and it was not pretty - they had their house burned down).

This has nothing to do with a ""Western"" perspective. It has to do with a reasonable perspective. Of course their religion is not real. When they start killing, looting and murdering over a delusion they have a problem - not the ones who draw bloody cartoons. Also burning something resembling a soldier is much different to making a silly cartoon. You are essentially saying you wish to kill someone by setting them on fire. A cartoon of Muhammed is just making fun of a historical figure that happens to have a cult of personality.

&gt;It's agitative because you're taking something that is intentionally a touchy topic for them, and trying your best to cause offence with it. If those drawings weren't culturally insensitive (and discriminatory towards Middle-Eastern culture), I don't know what were. Like with individuals, if you push a sensitive topic enough times, of course they're going to get pissed - to then go and say ""This is how barbaric they are!"" afterwards is inane.

There's a big difference between essentially creating the message you that you wish to burn someone alive and criticising religion. If you cannot see that you are deluded as hell. They have a choice not to go and turn the streets upside down over a silly cartoon and they choose not to do that. It is not our fault that they decide to be barbaric. They have the freedom to not act in such a manner. Just because we provoke them with a silly cartoon does not make us guilty of their actions. The fact we can provoke them with something as petty as a cartoon should scare you.

&gt;Then, of course, there is the similar issue of ""Only a Dane is allowed to fully speak their mind in Denmark"", ""Only a Danish opinion really counts"" (including the application to religion, where the secular war against Christianity is mild at best), and ""If you don't like something that the country does, you can get out!"". That is hardly equality.

Try to read what I wrote again. They're not above us, but no where did I write they were necessarily below us. As you say yourself, the idea of Janteloven is that you are not above anyone else. 

&gt;And to top it all off, of course, a fundamental misunderstanding of racism.

Actually you are the one who misunderstand the term in its entirety. When a ""race"" gets any sort of benefit or discrimination solely from being that ""race"" you have racism. This whole idea of positive discrimination is ludicrous. You will never combat racism when you are essentially saying ""You are lesser than us, here is some help to bring you up to our level"". Positive discrimination is still discrimination, and it is still racism, sexism, etc. no matter where you apply it.

If you have a problem with many people struggling at the bottom of society you should instead look towards programs that help those people indiscriminately. If you choose to start discriminating you have become part of the problem and are as vile as the most hardcore sexist or racist."

But to saddle a small child with a diagnosis and very serious medications so early... Well. Puts me in mind of the self-fulfilling prophecy of my Psych 20 days. 

See, I have to wonder about that psychiatrist of hers. Sure, *maybe* there's something going on with the kid, but in that case, take the kid to a child psychologist with a very good reputation and don't hold back about what's going on in their little lives. I mean, bipolar dad, new man in the kid's life, mother who seems awfully... unsure... Is it any wonder the kid is up and down? 

Thing is, and my mother is one of the *worst* ones for it... Family members and even some bipolar people can almost see... ghosts... But not real ghosts. More like every time anyone does anything even a little bit outside how they think they should act, the automatic explanation is bipolar. And I wouldn't put it past some psychiatrists to see such things, either. I mean, it's almost an insulated world, where 80% of the people they see come to them for some psychiatric help, is it any wonder they start to see it *everywhere*? 

I don't know, just something about this strikes me as *off* somehow... 

Might be decent to make sure the girl isn't being abused somehow by the new guy (or her dad) or something else that's all too common...

Okay, these are all lovely things to do for your partner, but as a woman, none of these things would necessarily signal to me that you want sex. 

When you are trying to initiate sex, does she *know* you are trying to initiate? Maybe you're not being straightforward enough.

Renner1,canada,1390318040.0,"&gt; Okay, you need to start actually READING what was written. I said the Iranian deli or carpet shop or whatever down the street in countries NOT IN IRAN are not the target of boycotts.

Do the owners consider themselves somehow intrinsically tied to Iran?

Many most likely have family there or are sentimental about the country, but by and large they're pretty neutral on the situation, apart from disliking the sanctions, right?

No one's actually talking about boycotting a shop because ""a Jew owns it"".

Some conglomerate run by some guy who has ties or cordial relations with the Likud party?

That's a different story.

&gt; The people I was referring to, Jews that are NOT IN ISRAEL, suffer more than the state under these ""boycotts"". 

Do they? Maybe they should start pushing for an end to the sustained, consistent state of sanctions against Iran that pro-Israel and Jewish community leaders laud and champion.

Failing that, maybe they should actually see why people are talking about boycotting Israeli products, instead of complaining ""anti Semitism"".

&gt; Remember, Jews =/= the state of Israel.

I'd say I argue that more then most Jewish people do-- the majority of the people who say ""Jews will always be tied to Israel"" are Jews themselves.

Something to take into account, hmm?

&gt; And where in international law is it illegal to boycott?

I said that Israel doesn't give a shit about international law, obviously. 
That's why other measures ought to be considered.

&gt; So. Do. Jews. About. Israel. God damnit. That's the whole point.

Nope. I have yet to hear of any substantial Jewish organization or community leadership that doesn't say ""Jews and Israel are one and the same"".

I'm not the one advocating that-- but a lot of Jews sure are. That's part of the problem.

On a positive note you also see what is going through aggrieved minds in many personal lawsuits and divorces, how hard it is to separate the possible - to - do from what is emotion and impossible to measure or work out legally. Money is a lousy way to measure things.

That said.

On the issue of sleeping in the same apartment but not the same bed as a co-worker and former lover? It seems normal enough from the point of view of non emotionally attached persons. But is also dangerous if an emotional attachment deepens asymmetrically, or jealousy intrudes , or his desire to have a friend visit for something like dalliance with another woman.

There are no rights or wrongs in this situation.

I think you also know all this, and are having difficulty with the effort and disruption with moving, dealing with everything to do with either of you leaving the shared accommodation. There is an inertia in humans to want to deal with things the way they already know and have become comfortable with. Change is risk, change is extra effort where all the effort is going elsewhere, there is discomfort and an unsettled feeling accompanying change.

You are sad because something like a permanent anchor or foundation to build from has come adrift in your physical and emotional groundwork to a solid future. But it has happened.

Continuing to sleep with (fuck) him would take an emotional detachment and treating it more like using a really advanced dildo. The words you have written suggest to me you would find that repugnant. I read that question more as a sort of wistful way of finding a glue to put Humpty back together again.

A big danger of proximity in the workforce is that it develops a feeling of intimacy and love between people engaged in some important task. The armed forces exploit this closeness during basic training to weld a unit into an emotionally engaged group of former strangers.

Work place romances usually develop from close contact in projects and sharing experiences.

The living together as roommates is a similar environment of stress and sharing that builds attachments.

Doctor Vorpal here recommends one or the other of you move out and both of you move on, and issues some compassion in little tiny virtual pills to all involved.

Nobody went out to steal boyfriends, nobody went bar hopping to find a little action on the side.

Life is what happens while you were planning something different.

I for example am great friends with more than one former roommate with benefits, it doesn't all have to end in a court with winners and losers."

Jackass up there claims that ""non-Jewish Middle East is ruled by the worst version of Shariah""-- either lying or ignorant.

You yourself seem to be stuck in 1980's Iran, where the very worst aspects of Khomeinist rule were fully in effect-- naturally, there's still a lot of issues in terms to opposing factions in Iran of today, but to claim that it's as it was at the worst of Khomeinism is to bald-facedly lie outright.

I think you and that moron deserve each other, but that's besides the point.

But the common traits you listed were bullshit.  

&gt;I don't want people to be like me. That would be silly.

You seem to work hard to deny any differences between you and them.  How is that not wanting people to be like you?

&gt;""All white people are white"" doesn't sound racist to you? 

No.  That's what's known as a tautology.  White people are white.  Cats are cats.  2 = 2.  It's not racist to acknowledge race exists.  It's racist not to.  Because ignoring race is something only white people can do.

&gt; I have no problem disagreeing with sociologists. I believe racism is bad, so I'm trying to avoid it. Even when I find it in the conventional wisdom.

I'm saying the people that have actually studied this and collected data say that your beliefs do more harm than good.  You can disagree with them, but you have nothing to back it up besides your own hubris.  You'll pardon me if I trust scientists over some white kid who clearly has no experience in the real adult world.

&gt;I also ignore whiteness, religion, and hand dominance.

So you'd serve a kosher jew bacon?  That doesn't make you not racist.  That makes you an asshole.

partspace,GirlGamers,1390318886.0,"Siiiiiigh.... okay. You want to know everything that went into this logo? Okay.

The only real direction I was given from the mods was no pink or purple. They didn't want the site to be stereotypically girly or overly feminine. So I went with the normal snoo colors: black, white, and orange, with varying shades thereof. 

First I had to figure out the best way to code the snoos as female. Long hair? Well, on a couple of them. One should have short hair, because long hair shouldn't be the only feminine trait. What about eyelashes or lipstick? Should they have a ""curvier"" shape so that it's a more feminine silhouette? No. Regular snoos with hair. Not even going to put ""girl"" clothes on them to make them even more different from the ""normal"" snoo.

Then I started to wonder if I should make one chubbier or skinnier, or one darker. Instead I went with the visual uniformity of all three the same color and shape.

Next came the controllers. The original idea was for them to have 3 different controllers to represent different consoles, but hey, you remember that time people made fun of the girl who didn't have her controller plugged in? I didn't want wrath for them being idiots trying to play with three different controllers for three different systems. And if we gave one a Wii controller or a mobile phone, then ermagod, girls are only casuals!

So THEN I had to figure out a controller that was recognizable in small scale. NES controllers were just blocks. The ones I ended up with are hard to see, so I made the last girl holding it only with one hand so that, hopefully, it was unmistakable what they were. 

I also had to give them wildly different and tiny expressions to show the spectrum of girl gamers. Neutral snoo (with hair over her eye, yes, was trying to be all anime-y with the eye showing through the hair.), hardcore redhead snoo, and brunette snoo who was just having a fun time. 

But the best part is that there are three of them. It isn't just one girl gamer, it's a *community*. So even if, secretly, the snoo in the middle is lifting up her shirt, the other two don't care, and they respect and support her no matter what."

Clearly you can't read very well or you're trying to string me along by playing the idiot.

Saying that the Middle East isn't overrun with Shariah, and that Iran is a largely mutable country and is a lot different from the ultra-Khomeinist system of the 1980s isn't the same as saying ""there are no human rights issues or problems in Saudi or Iran"".

Likewise-- and I have to take into account that you're a liar or not that intelligent-- stating the fact that plenty of Saudi expats despise and repudiate wahhabism, or that Iranian society is very multifaceted and diverse, or that there is an extensive political opposition within Iran all are not somehow ""in defense"" of HoS, wahhabism, or the Khomeinist elements within Iran.

The French ruled most of Europe  at the beginning of the 19th century and the metric system replaced the local measuring systems two centuries ago. Except in Britain and America among the places that counted in those days.

That said in some areas it was impractical to change to metric measure

Most of the really big installations of capital (manufacturing plants like steel mills and paper mills and plywood mills) were installed to the Imperial standard and shifting from feet to meters would mean replacing all that rolling mill designs and stuff at huge expense to supply buildings placed on lots surveyed out in Imperial dimensions. Our entire railroad system in North America is designed around what gauge hint hint?

It mattered not; it was mine.

The blade, over time and skill, was sharpened and fashioned. The rust was removed, galvanised within new steel. The handle was softened, easier to grip. But none of this happened quickly; the edge was bathed in blood, endured harsh temperatures and more than once failed when it was needed.

It mattered not; it was mine.

The blade began to draw more victories. Victories led to support. Support led to armies. Armies led to conquest. Victory upon victory, conquest upon conquest. As tribute, blacksmiths vowed to craft a blade so powerful and feared, it would shake the hearts of mankind for all eternity. But those blades would be forged in kilns and anvils; this blade was forged in battle, held in dark times when the world itself cast shadows upon me.

kowalski71,projectcar,1390320752.0,"Well I admire your ambition in the fabrication. You'll be a great welder by the time the project is done.

You're going to want to take a look at the dynamics of AWD systems a little bit. Most truck-based systems aren't designed for high performance. The modern rise of the AWD architecture (everything from Subarus and Evos right up to the GT-R, Veyron, and modern hybrid Le Mans cars) has been made possible by more advanced controls and differential technology. Even the relatively lowly STI (as compared to a purpose built racecar) has electronically controllable differentials.

You most likely won't get the performance you're looking for out of a truck system. For example, truck 4WD systems often have different final drives front and rear (off by .1 to .01 in the gear ratio, say 3.73 and 3.74). This forces the truck to drag the rear tires a bit and keeps it pointing forward. This is fine for an off road vehicle because your traction is so low that the wheels can slip in mud or ice and not cause any issues. On pavement with stickier tires that will cause quite a bit more trouble and will upset your handling a lot.

The AWD systems I imagine you would be interested in are rear bias performance car drivetrains. Not all AWD systems are created equal; for example, an Audi TT Quattro puts almost 80% of the power to the front wheels and the rear wheels get just enough drive for some added stability. If a car is available in FWD or AWD, expect a front bias. If it's available only in AWD or AWD and RWD then you'll probably have a rearward bias and it will be better for performance. In addition, I would steer clear of the highly electronic systems. Computers will be a pain for this project.

The BMW AWD system from the E30 might be of interest. These ran particularly good differentials but aren't built to take high power. The Chrysler LX platform (Charger, 300C) will be plenty beefy, though it's new enough to have some frustrating electronics. The old Quattro system is a really terrific system, if you look at [all the old generations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quattro_(four-wheel-drive_system)_) you'll find something easier to work on and cheaper.

If I think of any other possible donor cars I'll let you know."

what, in your opinion, IS a hooligan bike? Don't tell me that bike is or list HP numbers. Tell me, in your opinion:

""what makes this bike a hooligan bike?""

------------

yes, two stroke street bikes, even dirt bikes with 17"" rims and PR3's, are hooligan bikes. They meet my ""completely senseless, utterly ridiculous, and non-utilitarian"" requirement.

But generally, when we are talking about hooligan bikes, we mean modern, factory ones. and we definitely aren't describing something mundane or commonplace. And for the most part, approximate liter-sized I4, I3, V2 and V4 aren't either of those. And currently, those engines happen to be in the only NEW hooligan bikes around.

The problem with the Street Triple, is that it's big brother always takes the spotlight and that it is a more sensible ruffian or ne'er-do-well, capable of minding manners in public, rather than the straight thug of the big bad Speed3 or it's buddy in crime, Mr.Superduke.

5) Add up all the employees to get how many there are. Since there are at least 100, use the bottom row of costs to add the costs of trousers, shirt, and shoes. Multiply this total cost by the total number of employees.

6) Add up the cost of an admin uniform  (shirt and shoes) on the top row, then on the bottom row. (bottom row)/(top row) tells you what percentage of the price of the top row the bottom row is. Use that to find the discount.

7) Figure out how much each department costs separately. Use the number in each department to figure out which row to look at for cost, then use the category (admin or operational) to look at which columns of cost to use, then multiply the cost by the number of people in the department. Do that for all five departments.

8) Add up the Delivery and Warehouse costs you found in Question 7. Now add the people in Delivery and Warehouse together and use the appropriate row to figure out the costs for the combined department. Find the difference.

bleedscarlet,DIY,1390320993.0,"That's one of my biggest worries with wax, and why I was going to give sealing wax a try, higher temperature melting point and slightly less deformation due to heat. And I was also thinking perhaps a very thin layer brushed on with the fabric mesh so it doesn't get THAT hot, in my epoxy/resin experience heat is exacerbated by quantity of resin and hardener used, so this would be a 50/50 mix instead of the normal 66/33, and it would be really light to create a hardened shell quickly, and hopefully it won't melt the internal structure created by the sealing wax. Afterwards I'd glob on a slightly thicker layer, and then lastly i'd do a pour-over layer that's nice and glossy, and will have some epoxy to hold its shape.

Honestly, the more and more I think about it, the less and less viable it seems to be. I'm starting to lean towards wooden legs with foam around them for smooth and easy to carve shaping, and then epoxy just for the finishing touch. There's no shortcuts in good work."

In developing countries or countries where there are issues with equal food distribution, having a bit more girth is considered healthy and desirable. One need only look for all the anecdotes of people going to Africa and being given lots of food by their African hosts because they fear they're undernourished.

RussDaBus,AskReddit,1390321080.0,"I was right around 17 and I went on a date with a girl who I had known from when I was in elementary school. 

Before the date, we had spent some time catching up and reminiscing about what had happened since the last time we had seen each other. Well, I had just had a hell of a breakup and I was looking to maybe move on or perhaps get my mind off the other girl. So I ask if she wants to go see a movie. She accepts.

Now things start to get weird about here. Before heading to the movie I have to meet her parents. Not terribly unusual I suppose, but on a first date? Needless to say I was uncomfortable from the start. I walk in and her home is what I can only describe as a ""Redneck Hut"". Wood paneling everywhere. Old dingy ass carpet and a stocked gun cabinet. Her parents were nice enough, but I was a bit put off.

We go to this movie and I'm already having a difficult time getting comfortable and what does she do? Talks nonstop. Through the whole movie. On her phone or to me. Random shit. Stuff about anything and everything.

Now I'm no movie elitist. I talk during movies. Like commenting on parts I like or don't like. But god damn. Not the whole fucking thing.

We didn't go out again. In fact, she started dating some dude like 3 days after that.

this is the most important thing.  are you?  tell us some about your respective backgrounds

when i was a grad student i dated a college freshman who i met at a soccer game.  i was doing theoretical research into advanced jet fuel, and was otherwise very socially successful and together.  she was failing out of the elementary education program and had no idea how to deal with people.  my motivations for that relationship were obvious.  she was discarded as soon as i was bored with her.  

i would liken the life experience and intelligence gap there to a typical 24f/40m relationship, but you may be the exception.  most 24 year old women with the intelligence and maturity of a 40 year old men are able to find men in their age group who are also their intellectual/social equals.  most 24 year old women dating much older men merely think they are smarter or more mature.

i went on to marry a woman my own age who was much more mature than her peers.  that is what most men want, i think.  the much younger and less mature women are for fun until we get bored.

&gt;So its known that there was no such thing as a 'viking state,' as in a single nation with vikings. instead it was a group of chief led tribes that didnt really get along well, am i right?

No. A Norse kingdom would be [Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) which we know had a king, [Godfred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudfred), as far back to the time of [Charlemagne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne) when, according to legend, he invaded [Frisia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisia) and had [Danevirke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danevirke) built.

Some of the most famous ""Vikings"" would even be kings such as [Sweyn Forkbeard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweyn_Forkbeard) and [Cnut the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut_the_Great) who ruled Denmark, Norway and England. Also for reference, the [Danelaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelaw) was created a few decades earlier to this.

But you are partly right for a group of chiefs did lead for a time in some places in Scandinavia. Although it might be more prudent to consider them elected officials as they were voted into power through [tings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_%28assembly%29), a kind of village council. Our parliament in Denmark today is actually called *Folketinget* which roughly translates to *Assembly of the People*.

&gt;if they all fight and all were different, how does one define 'norse paganism?'

Usually it is simply defined as the [Germanic pantheon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_paganism) that lingered in Northern Europe after [Charlemagne's Saxon wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_wars). It is often attributed to just the Norse, but that is simply wrong to do. It was not unified faith and that was its weakness compared to the organized religion of Christianity.

Today we know some things through the [Edda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edda), but since a lot of the tales were sung by [skalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skald) a lot have been lost. Sadly it seems, as magnificent as they are, then runestones are not the best way to retain knowledge."

Renner1,canada,1390321450.0,"&gt; No, not what I said. Simple as that. Show me ""perfect"" in my posts.

That was essentially the implication. Everyone who says otherwise is a liar, Israel graciously allows Palestinians to speak Palestinian Arabic. Accolades, accolades.

&gt; Working with other legislators, particularly in big tent parties, is an effective way to legislate. Civics 101. These parties exist in Israel, e.g. Meretz

Assuming all the Palestinian interest/Palestinian dominated groups came together into one political entity, what would stop the explicitly Zionist-nationalist groups-- Likud, YB, Yesh Atid, Hatnuah, Shas, Jewish Home-- from saying outright ""you're not permitted to push for this"" or simply try to collectively go against anything that the united Palestinian parties would be aiming for? 

I mean, they've seriously talked about getting rid of the Palestinian interest parties in the past, and the centre-right wants to bar them from participating at all unless they're ingratiatingly Zionistic.

aDDnTN,motorcycles,1390321452.0,"in many bikes, new and old, the choke also increases the idle speed. 

look in a manual to find out your factory set idle rpm and try to make it stay there. if you can't find that, just go with what seems good on the bike when warmed up. Basically, if the bike idles evenly and you can blip the throttle without lag or stutter, then you are at the right rev. Note, if you can only get this at &gt;3000 rpm, you need to get your carbs cleaned or your fuel screws or carb balance are out of wack.

as for how to go about it. Get the bike warmed up good and choke it until you have a steady idle (doesn't matter rpm as long as not &gt;4000 rpm). adjust the idle up while choke until it goes up 500 rpm, dial back the choke until it goes back to where you started. Repeat until the choke is fully closed and then keep backing off the idle until the bike starts to idle unevenly. Then increase idle to get it back to what i said earlier, if the bike idles evenly and you can blip the throttle without lag or stutter, then you are at the right rev."

eurephys,assassinscreed,1390322003.0,"Not explained in any of the stuff I've read, but I think it's due to relative distance.

Pre-POC, the hidden blade's construction made it so it was *hidden*, even under sleeves. So the blade itself had to be as close to the wearer's arm as possible so it doesn't snag. It also wasn't build to withstand much force, and wasn't long enough to be used offensively as a primary weapon. So from that we can conclude that the blade extended an inch from the wearer's fist, rather than the two inches it does now.

And since it can't withstand much force, then it's possible that an open palm strike puts too much perpendicular strain on the mechanism when the blade is out, which may cause the blade itself to snap free from the mechanism and fall out. Having it come out of a fist serves two purposes: one, it allows for the blade to be ejected from a closed fist, provided that the mechanism still relied on a button switch rather than a string. This provides more stabbing force without adding too much strain on the mechanism itself. Two, this allows for a stealthier kill with the blade. An open palm strike reveals the blade immediately, whereas a closed fist gives the impression that the wearer drew blood with a simple punch. And with the mystical, almost theatrical approach the Levantine Assassins took, this would definitely help.

Now to the adjustments. Raising the distance of the blade by a few centimetres off the arm and crafting the blade into a telescopic mechanism, therefore extending it by an inch further has improved it dramatically.

By adding the extra distance, the blade can now have a full casing which now allows for it to withstand strikes on the blade itself, made even more possible by the blade's telescopic shell. With the armoured vambrace it's often constructed on, this allows the blade to now be used offensively like a dagger.

Additionally, the larger casing has allowed for the blade to be modular, with many additions such as a pistol, a hookblade and even a pivot to be added on with little difficulty or strain on the blade itself.

However, this has made the blade less conspicuous, now requiring a large amount of space on the arm, and if ever worn under a sleeve, has the chance to snag on any clothing and rip it."

Pipstydoo,playrust,1390322821.0,"From [here](http://www.drawloc.com/content/crossbow-vs-compound-bow):

&gt;ACCURACY: The compound bow is more accurate due to the fact of a consistent anchor point. String loops have become a must for extreme accuracy. The arrow sits between the string loop knots and the release is held on the string loop in the same place every time making it very accurate. The crossbow has to be drawn and locked into a latch where the consistent string position can be compromised, allowing for the arrow to hit the left or to the right of the target. This is why Competitive Compound Bow Shooters score higher than Cross Bow Shooters in the same tournament.

From [here](http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/whitetail-365/2013/10/cross-conventional-compound-vs-crossbow):

&gt;Accuracy: I shot my compound for accuracy against the Excalibur Matrix 380 Xtra at 40 yards. Offhand, I shot 4-inch groups with the crossbow and 3.75-inch groups with my compound. But when I put the crossbow on shooting sticks, my groups shrunk to 2.63 inches. Shooting sticks, or a treestand shooting rail, are a crossbow-only capability that many hunters use in the field. Edge: Crossbow."

Dabookitty,atheism,1390322951.0,"Your fallacy is you are comparing things that are not comparable.  Last time I checked a light switch does not have a choice like humans do over divorce.  

Even your thunderstorm comparison is bad.  Just because your light switch not working sometimes in a thunderstorm does not form causation...there can be so many other things causing that problem.  It's like when you have a black/brown outs in hot weather.  Very rarely is the heat directly responsible(Damage to power lines, over heating generators, etc).  More often it is the demand for more power by Air Conditioning Units...the heat is not directly responisble, it only influences otehr factors that directly play a roll.  

They are 2 completely different sciences that do not relate.  It would be like comparing Math to Early Child Development.

In Math there is a definate right and wrong answer(not talking about quantum physics here), there is no room for debate.  The reason why your child is learning slower then the other children...there can be a multitude of right and wrong answers.  And more often then not it's a combination of answers that are correct all to differing degrees.  Child 1, might be a comination of A, C, R and with a heavy influence by R.  While Child 2 is A, R, D with D playing a larger part.

When you are studying human behaviour it's not as simple as do research and get answer like you can in the hard sciences.  The closest hard science I can think of would be Pharmacology, since different people can have different reactions to the same drug.

No, it's outlining why something happens. Doesn't justify it, just explains it.

Of course, the person who carried out such an attack could be criminally minded or sociopathic or any other thing that can befall a person, but the overwhelming likelihood is that any attack on any Israeli settler is a byproduct of the brutal and stupid settlers and their ongoing theft of what little Palestinian land remains Palestinian.

&gt; that a pregnant woman should have been stabbed to death because ""how many palestinian women have been killed!?!?""

I didn't say the oft-mentioned pregnant woman ""should"" have been stabbed to death.

It is telling that the usual sorts will focus on the one dead Israeli woman and all the Palestinian women who have died at Israeli hands either ""brought it on themselves"" or it's as though they were dead insects. Their deaths don't matter but AN ISRAELI WAS MURDEROUSLY MURDERED BY A MURDEROUS PALESTINIAN MURDERER. THEY ALL HAVE TO DIE.

Once in Spanish my senior year of high school the classes were assigned a project. 

The other classes had all been failing and our class was sort of pissed and scared that we would fail too. While talking among ourselves I said that if we all failed I would call the teacher out for grading too harshly or not explaining what we were supposed to do. We were forced to have partners and I hate working with people too stupid, lazy, or ""alpha"" to listen to me but luckily I got paired with a friend. I pretty much did everything myself, he was worried but checked in to see how I was doing. 

So it gets to presentation day and after a misplaced USB stick, it was our turn. We presented and got a 'B'. Perfect for me, and my friend said he wouldn't have done better. Everyone else goes and end up getting worse grades, only like one pair of girls beat us and they were the studious type. 

Anyways the one kid that wanted me to confront the teacher the most asked why I didn't say anything. I told him I got a decent grade and really didn't put much effort into it so I don't know how everyone else got shit grades. He was upset but couldn't really argue.

**TL;DR** - Teacher assigns project and everyone else is getting poor grades. I was going to call her out, but ended up getting a decent grade so told everyone else it was their problem.

I don't just go around telling people I'm bi, if it comes up, I don't lie about it, but I also don't feel the need to scream it to the heavens, which is probably another reason its hard to find someone.

But we can't have a good season based around trying to give him touches to see if he can bust a big one. All those plays that go nowhere end up killing drives. I'd rather see Greene get 4 yards a carry and drive us down field in a 20 play drive and then get a TD out of the drive, than to see us give CJ the ball 30 times a game and he get stopped for less than 2 yards on half of those. Each of those stops contributes to a 3 and out, and lost drive. Then the other team's offense is on the field. Twice a year that team is the Colts. Their offense is going to score more often than not. We need to give them as few opportunities to do so as we can. 

Right now, they are the best in the division. The Texans aren't bad. The Jags are going to be better. But right now, the question we need to ask ourselves is ""what do we need to do to beat the Colts?"" And if CJ isn't helping us beat them, then he's dead weight. "

bayern doesnt really produce a lot of talent themselves. because they can just buy them once they are developed. even a kroos and a alaba who some bayern supporters consider ""homegrown talent"" have been bought from other academies when they were 18 &amp; 17. same for hojberg.
the last bayern products that were actually incooperated in a meaningful way into the roster were contento, müller &amp; badstuber. that was under van gaal and mainly because of his good nose for talents and stubbornness (esp in badstubers case, badstuber just got the shot because van gaal wanted a left footed cb). all three of them were not given shots prior and probably not under another coach either, despite their talent. and before them? well, lahm and schweinsteiger. they are both almost 30 now. however, as i understand pep actually wants to change that and move the focus to youth development in the future.

BonzoTheBoss,DaystromInstitute,1390323717.0,"He carried the katra (telepathic spirit?) of Surak, the founder of Vulcan logic and rationalism through emotional mastery, who's teachings and philosophies during the Time of Awakening (4th Century CE) brought Vulcan society back from the brink of violent nuclear genocide.

The knowledge bestowed by Surak's katra enabled Archer to re-discover the Kir'Shara, an ancient Vulcan artifact that contained the original writings and teachings of logic, emotional control and the embracing of non-violence created by Surak himself.

Such a definitive single source of Surak's teachings enabled the fractured and increasingly militaristic Vulcan society of the 22nd Century to unite once again and cast out the old order of the dictorial High Command, ushering in the era of Vulcans we have grown to know and love in the 23rd and 24th Centuries, whereas before Vulcans only had partial or mistranslated writings of Surak's teachings, that were open to interpretation.

It could be argued that without Archer the Syrranites (a Vulcan splinter group considered ""radicals"" by the High Command, when in fact they were pacifists trying to find their way back to the original teachings of Surak) would never have found the Kir'Shara, as the previous holder of Surak's katra, Syrran, leader of the Syrranites, had not been able to find it after years of searching. Yet mere days after receiving the katra from Syrran prior to his imminent death from a natural electric discharge, Archer was able to find it.

It could be Archer was more ""telepathically compatible"" with the katra but this seems counter-intuitive, given that humans possess no telepathic abilities at all. But we know they can receive mind melds. Or perhaps the katra of Surak recognised that Archer, an outsider, was needed to bring Vulcan society together. It is debatable how sentient or conscious a katra is, but we do see Surak conversing with Archer in his mind, so we can assume the katra has some effect over the conscious host, almost like a ""blending"" we see in Trill?

**TL;DR**: Archer is more like Vulcan Moses than Jesus."

You're going to get opinions, too.)

Honesty about your emotional state is difficult for many people, probably especially for him because he loved you and didn't want to hurt you, but didn't see a way to make both these relationships work.  Maybe he was in denial for a while, but realized later that deep down, he always knew he'd have to make a choice, and what that choice would be.

You don't HAVE to empathize with him now, because that's the last thing someone who is hurt and angry wants to do in the moment, but if you want to heal from this it will help if you can eventually.  

You have a primary - a fiance.  Someone you're committing to for life (hopefully).  He knew he'd always have a secondary role in your life, and admitted to you he wanted a primary relationship as well, which you should be able to understand because you know the benefits of having one - the trust, commitment, etc.  It may hurt, but you can't begrudge him wanting that, and it's very hard for someone already acting as a secondary to an existing couple to find someone who wants to commit to them.  It's just not a very attractive prospect for most people.  

He may have gone about the breakup in a dishonest and shitty way and you have every right to be pissed and hurt about that, and you have my sympathy for that.  But it also sounds like right now, you're just mad that his needs didn't align with yours, and that's not fair to him, nor does it negate the great times you had together.

Daytona isn't a hooligan because it lacks handlebars and it's fully-faired. like i said HP isn't the requirement. No one would ever argue that it's a Hooligan Bike. Even if it might be a **HOOLIGAN'S** BIKE.

&gt; I don't think of hooligan as a bike, it's more like a way of life as cliche as that sounds.

OK, well this convo wasn't about ""hooligans and the hooligan lifestyle"". It was about HOOLIGAN **BIKES**. 

OP called his Striple a hooligan bike and i disagreed, we discussed it and came to see each others point, simple as that. 

You seem to be interested in confusing that issue with your philosophy regarding lifestyle choices, so let's talk about that.

--------------------------------------------

What's the point of categories if you won't draw lines and make boxes, then put things in them and keep them separate from the other boxes? What makes an enduro different from a dual-sport, different from an adventure bike? A touring different from a sport touring? A supersport different from a street sport? What makes a muscle bike different from a dragster? What's the differences between a classic and a standard? A chopper and a cafe? etc..

I would be more than happy to continue a discussion about the philosophy of different riders. And i would love to have a discussion about what you feel makes each type of category unique from the adjacent ones. 

But consider if we take your current point to the extreme, ""All motorcycles are all motorcycles."" then we've got no boxes. That sounds PC and imo, motorcyclists and PC-ness don't mix. Let's get decisive.

I'm not trying to be hostile, so speak your mind freely and please don't get defensive. i will try to stay objective.

You may be quite clear, it just doens't mean that he cares.  He sounds pretty selfish.  I know with women it can be more difficult to orgasm for men, but like you, I get resentful if I don't come during most of our sexual encounters, and I feel like I have a right to be able to come if he does.  There are times when I'm fine with not getting off (and I let him know those times) but I want him to see it as something he should at least try to do.  Asking for that isn't selfish, it's fair.  

I'm trying not to cloud my advice based on thinking your BF is being a jerk...because to me it sounds like he's being a jerk.  He wants what he wants and isn't meeting you halfway.

Anyway, on your own end, BUY the vibrator (every woman should own one!) and also, yes, lube.  I get sore if we go at it too much without enough,  and lube is a good way to solve that.  Another good way would be for him to ensure you get off first - the vast majority of women lubricate enough by the time they've reached orgasm that extra synthetic lubrication isn't needed.

All your ideas are good ones (sex schedule, scheduled not sex days, etc) but he has to be willing to meet you halfway.  His response to these ideas and how he follows through will tell you if he's someone worth investing your time and energy in."

Since you brought up math, i'll tell an amusing tale of my one and only math class I took in order to earn my art degree. First off some background: my father is an engineer, so math was somewhat of a second language between father and I. I excelled at math my entire life, taking calculus as a high school senior. Flash forward 3 years later, my degree plan needed a math class, and ""Math for Elementary Education"" fit my plan; my major was very time/labor intensive (cinematography) so I figured, pssh, easy A. On that note I was right; I didn't realize, however, that since Professor Sheep (his surname means sheep in french) was grading on a curve, an intimidation scene was in my future. You see, this math class was *very* popular with the football team. Prof Sheep a. graded on a curve and b. gave lots of extra credit. The result was a set of my test scores that never dipped below 105%. Stupid prof made a show of giving me my tests back, so that it as apparent whose ""fault"" it was that the curve was essentially eliminated by my scores. After class one day I turned the corner to find a group of 5 behemoths waiting for me, upset about my curve possibly keeping some of their grades low enough damage their eligibility. Being a fast thinker I stalled them, saying give me a bit to fix things. I went to the prof's office immediately afterwards and presented to him the idea that I should be left off the curve, going briefly over my math background. He agreed, after next class the giants bought me lunch and beer. "

Dleraings,AskReddit,1390324743.0,"My first date with my boyfriend was the most amazing fun time I've ever had. I traveled 10'000 miles to see him again after nine months of being apart. While long distance we started 'going out' and would Skype every day/night. Sleep deprived me got used to the UK timezone so jet lag wasn't an issue, and as soon as we met and shared embrace, we left to go to a burger bar in London, where we shared a banana milkshake.     
We walked around Hyde gardens in an emotional mixture of shyness and ecstasy, holding hands. He showed me my first real-live squirrel and we sat and just generally had fun together.

It was the most amazing, breath-taking time of my life and we couldn't have had a better time if we tried!"

a) has had past sexual partners
b) masturbates and/or looks at porn
c) is attracted to other people even if they don't act on it

Jealousy and insecurity kills lots of relationships, and very often it comes from a place of the far end of mono thinking: ""If I were enough for my partner, they wouldn't desire anything other than me.""  "

DreadfulRauw,PoliticalDiscussion,1390324880.0,"&gt; bull shit or not, its what we have. and its the common beliefs that will keep people from killing each other. it will also allow individuals to not get sucked in to group role ruts and change economic class easier because they won't be suspiciously regarding people outside of their group. because who wants to hire someone that thinks bad things about you based on your family heritage .


If common beliefs are what keep you from killing someone then you're the problem, not them.  That's psycho talk.

&gt;hey race is a dumb concept we should stop using it. it rightfully belongs between you, your physician, your family, and your geneologist. in public policy it causes only polarization, exclusion and grief. if sociologists disagree with me that's cool. I'm open to listening to their rebuttal. so far I haven't found any that won't prolong racial tensions.

Public policy acknowledged race for years and caused huge amounts of damage.  You're not going to fix that damage now by ignoring race.  Because you can only ignore race after all racism has been eliminated.  You're putting the cart before the horse.  There are people still actively being discriminated against because of their race, and you're telling them race doesn't matter.  Well, the fact that their still being discriminated against due to race proves you wrong.  Yes, a world without racism is a beautiful dream.  So is a world without hunger, the need for money, and sickness.  But you have to accept reality and work on the current situation, not just declare your goal for a utopia and call other people evil.  Racial tensions exist because people like you continue to ignore the problems that exist.

&gt;Most of the people I know who self identify as Jewish adore bacon. they claim it's a vegetable or kosher. though that might be a statistical anomaly based on the folks I hang out with. they'll avoid ham or roast pork, but bbq and bacon are definitely on the menu. don't ask me why. I wouldn't serve pork to someone with religious issues on purpose, that would be just rude. I have by accident and I felt horrible about it.

You just said you ignore religion.  Why would you consider it rude to serve pork to someone religiously opposed to it?

&gt;rephase the quote as ""black people are black"" or ""jewish people are jews"". sounds creepy. but people don't get queasy assigning group qualities to white people like racism, privilege, or ignorance. racism is racism no matter who you use it against.

Not all whites are racist or ignorant.  All whites have white privilege.  It comes with the skin color.  It means you're part of the dominant race in America and that has perks.  If you don't know that, you've clearly ignored doing your research.

&gt;I work at a big 10 school. the activists I'm surrounded with all seem to be working toward maintaining group Identity politics. they don't seem to have an endgame. there isn't a point where they can declare success. they seem to be floundering from one news cycle to the next. the main goal as far as I can tell is to keep people fighting. to keep their side winning. not to create the racial harmony they claim to support. it looks like to me they are working on a issue prominence business model. it's weird.

Because it's not one big fight.  It's lots of little ones.  It's individual housing units that discriminate, or an employer, or a law that harms one race more than others.  You can't organize a group for each individual occurrence.  You keep a standing group ready

&gt;in the 60's civil rights groups had a goal and a mission. and some still do today, the splc is a good example they fight the remnants of the confederacy,

The SPLC fights much more than just the remnants of the confederacy.

&gt;al sharpton and jesse jackson don't really have a goal. other than to keep fighting the 60's, the KKK dosen't really have a goal. other than to train FBI agents and drink beer.

Again, do your research.  Jesse Jackson is the figurehead of the Rainbow coalition, which currently has several issues they're supporting, including access to healthcare and an assault weapons ban.  Al Sharpton's National Action Network also works against gun violence and elimination of poverty.

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1390325002.0,"In real life, I only know one other non-mono couple well, and they're doing fine.  Even if they weren't, any issues they have are unlikely to be caused by their non-mono situation.

On the internet?  Whew.  Well you just have to read this forum.  Or listen to any poly, swinger, or open-based podcasts.  Kidder Kaper (formerly from the Sex is Fun podcast) 's marriage almost ended due to his jealousy and his wife's lying when they opened their marriage a bit more.  Shira B and Gavin Katz's relationship ended as a direct result of their polyamory (he was cut off from sex for months while listening to her bang her new boyfriend in the other room, ffs!)  Throwawaybobdobs mentioned another relationship from ""The Swingset"" podcast ending.  

Sure people can say ""Those relationships were unhealthy/would've ended anyway/etc"" but it's hard to say.  When you throw NRE into the mix - hell, when you're ACTIVELY courting it, as poly people are by the nature of their relationship structures - you're introducing instability into a relationship.  This isn't inherently bad or good - it's neutral.  But it is instability and can often be the catalyst for a relationship ending.

Swingers seem to have the most stable relationships, probably because of the primacy of the couple in terms of how they play.   ""Open"" is just an umbrella term so it's hard to judge.  I would guess that polyamory is the least stable of these relationship configurations again, because you're actively courting NRE, which creates a lot more drama.  It's also a chicken and the egg question, though.  Many people may be drawn to non-monogamy because they crave variety, have a low threshold for boredom, etc.  These types of people are going to have less stable relationships in general.  "

duckduck_goose,Frugal,1390325398.0,"Frugal doesn't like this idea but you should slash your food budget by learning to coupon. Do a search for your area and coupon bloggers. I read that you can do $100 per adult and $50 per child so that's HALF your grocery budget. It will be slow and require discipline however that will severely help. Since you have smart phones put Ibotta (the app) on both of them so you can double down on savings with their cash back. I seriously have enough in my pantry currently to feed all 3 of you for 3 months and my budget for 1 person is under $100/mo.

I'd dump Netflix. You already pay for internet. Stream and learn to download shows. I don't have Netflix and I'm doing fine. Sure it's only $9 month but that's $9 toward other things. It adds up.

I have Virgin for $30/mo. I had to pay full price for my phone but it suits me fine. I can't even fathom paying $200/mo for a phone.

Can you offset some of that driving with a bus pass? I pay $100/mo for a bus pass but I live in a urban area. $250 in gas seems really crazy.

CrazyPlato,rpg,1390325450.0,"I have a concept:

The plane is artificial, made by the races of the traditional DnD universe as a prison plane. Basically, it's the Australia to the main world's England: criminals of the highest caliber are thrown here to spend their lives in exile, and are cut off from any planes inhabited by the ""civilized"" races.

Each PC is one of those criminals. Their I dividial crimes are up to the players, but it's implied that, on paper, they did something horrible. Maybe they were mass murderers,at e they were good people framed for a crime they had nothing to do with. Equally versatile are their motivations: Will they try to carve out a kingdom in their exile, become masters of the anarchy, or try to find a way home to resolved their unfinished business from their old lives?

There of course will be ways to breach their exile, routes back to the home planes. But all the ones that the prime races know of are heavily guarded. The inhabitants of this plane of exile are prisoners like the party, as well as the ubiquitous lower races and monsters. These races may have their own towns and kingdoms (imagine Kobold, the capital city of the kobold nation of Kobold), and older prisoners may also have established their own settlements. The personalities of the inhabitants vary from the fresh psychopaths, to weary experienced inmates sick of fighting, even prisoners who found peace and built homes and families.

One thread hangs over the gloom: all of the PCs are prisoners, torn from their old lives? Will they fight to get them back, or turn to a new path?"

K2TheM,motorcycles,1390325770.0,"Start by looking at mid 80's UJMs (Universal Japanese Make). This includes Honda CB's, Yamaha XS, Kawasaki KZ, and Suzuki GS. These bikes are all basically the same bike, just with different badges. They all are about equal in reliability and offer the best ""basic"" bike experience you could buy. Look for anything 250cc  to 650cc.

There are several different versions of these bikes, and finding one for under 1K that is street worthy is doable, but it's going to be tough. It's gonna take a couple months of checking your local Craigslist every hour with cash in hand and a truck on retainer to meet a seller. Good deals can be found, but you have to be able to be the first one to the seller. 

My first bike was a 1984 Honda Nighthawk 650. IIRC it was about $600; had no front brakes (as in the calipers weren't even there), a cashmere seat, and needed tires desperately. After replacing all the needed parts, it came out to ~$1K. The perfect beginner bike. Often this is the way to get a road worthy bike. A running bike that has good maintance will normally be more than 1K, but a bike that needs some work but is running can be had for less than 1K and be fixed up under budget. 

Be sure to keep gear cost in mind. I'd put minimums for each at $150 for a helmet, $200 for a jacket, $100 for boots, and $75 for gloves. "

Not at all.  A correlation is a relationship between 2 variables that is all, nothing more nothing less.  We have to discover the relationship and how one influences the other.  

It just happens that the Map that points to more Divorces happen in area's that are high in Conservative Christians is also an area that is frequented by Hurricanes.  Hurricanes seems to have a high correlation to divorces within the US.  So do Hurricanes cause Divorce?  Maybe Divorce Causes Hurricanes?  Conservative Christians cause Hurricanes?  Or Hurricanes cause people to become Conservative Christians?  God sends hurricanes because he wants to punish the Conservatives Christians in the US?

You can make a statistic mean pretty much anything you want it to mean...that is why sociologists and psychologists analyze the information to better determine the **WHY** the two variables are correlated.

A little background, following the assassination of McKinley in 1901 Congress passed legislation which formally requested that the US Secret Service's mission to include protection of the POTUS, it has been expanded further and the entire list of protected persons can be found [here in United States Code: Title 18, Section 3056](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3056). At the time of the Secret Service's inception the only federal law enforcement agencies were the US Park Police, the US Marshals, and what is now known as the US Postal Inspection Service. The Secret Service was created because none of these services had the capacity or manpower to act as an investigative agency. 

This excerpt from [the Appendix of the Warren Commission Report](http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html) following the assassination of JFK should answer most of your question: 
&gt;""This third assassination of a President in a little more than a generation--it was only 36 years since Lincoln had been killed--shook the nation and aroused it to a greater awareness of the uniqueness of the Presidency and the grim hazards that surrounded an incumbent of that Office. The first congressional session after the assassination of McKinley gave more attention to legislation concerning attacks on the President than had any previous Congress but did not pass any measures for the protection of the President.32 Nevertheless, in 1902 the Secret Service, which was then the only Federal general investigative agency of any consequence, assumed full-time responsibility for the safety of the President. Protection of the President now became one of its major permanent functions, and it assigned two men to its original full-time White House detail. Additional agents were provided when the President traveled or went on vacation.""

Work from chart for 29 rounds, then separate the 10 thumb sts by knitting them in waste yarn. (Thumb is placed 1 stitch in from edge) Work in pattern for 28 rounds past thumb, then start decreasing. Decrease 4sts every other round 3 times total, then every round until 12sts remain, then break yarn and pull through all stitches.

Pickup 24sts around thumb opening, work in charted pattern for 16 rounds, then decrease 4 sts on every round until 10 sts remain. (....this is an obvious error. Decrease to either 12 or 8 sts, it's your call.) "

redundanteater,literature,1390326034.0,"I hear where you're coming from, but as a grad, you have to be aware that Columbia is renowned for being one of the last ""great book"" oriented undergraduate programs. It basically stands alone in higher education for its approach to both the bridge and the first year curriculum in general (mostly due nowadays to Roosevelt Montas). I think that this matter was even a research topic at either the AAC&amp;U or with the Carnegie people a few years back.

I'm not dismissing applying theory to the study of literature in graduate school, but I am firmly against both forcing it on undergraduates or teaching theory for its own sake in English Departments. English Departments shouldn't be dumbed-down versions of other departments. We have enough to do as it is.

Mostly I'm angry at needlessly obfuscatory theory work, which has moved further and further away from proposing useful tools for the analysis of works of literature and which is instead used to indoctrinate students to specific political agendas. I don't want to be around the sorts of people who confuse teaching literature with what you call ""trying to make a political point."" My view is this: Leave post colonialism and Shakespeare for a graduate seminars, and teach undergraduates the nuts and bolts of the plays and poems first.

And if you think that sub-Saharan literature or the Tale of Genji has had as important an effect on English literature as has Dante, I don't know what to say. The Inferno is more influential on the development of western literature than absolutely everything ever written on the continent of Africa combined. And once we exclude the Bible, even the literature of the Levant is unimportant… e.g.  Gilgamesh, which is interesting as an early epic (and we could easily add Atrahasis among others)… it was only rediscovered in the 1870s.

Undergraduate majors are limited in terms of credits, usually about 36 at the most. That means a grand total of 12 courses (UCLA's much discussed program being 4 ""historical,"" 3 ""broad,"" 2 electives and a capstone). If you look at UCLA's offerings, the different areas have enough options in them to create an incredibly useless BA where students would come away with not only a narrow but stilted understanding of one thousand years of English writing, and who would be almost guaranteed to bomb on the subject GRE. I don't think it would be difficult to go back to a more rigorously defined historical core of say 5 courses. I put this entire thing down to self-centered baby boomer faculty in the 1980s wanting to teach their own little pet areas without any consideration for their students or for a broad understanding of English literature."

The_White_Baron,learnmath,1390326257.0,"In general, the quality rate is given by # accepted / # issues.

We want to find some number of new issues, n, that satisfies a given quality rate. We're given that we initially have 58 issues, so we will add n new issues. Since we want the minimum amount of new issues, we'll say that every issue added is accepted. # accepted = 52 + n. # issues = 58 + n.

(52 + n)/(58 + n) = 0.92. 

rearranging yields

n = (58 x 0.92 - 52) / (1 - 0.92)

As you found, you get exactly 17 issues. If the values change, you can put the new values into this formula to find how many issues you need to achieve a desire quality rate."

I mentioned casually that I wanted to get up on the summer solstice and watch the sunrise, and he jumped on that idea. So we got up at like 5 am or whenever it was and went down to the river and sat on the riverbank and sat together, drank shitty coffee, watched a little both of the sunrise and mostly fooled around on the shore while the sun rose around us. Then after that we decided to get breakfast at the 24 hour diner us and our friends would always go to at night, and it was a completely different world at 7 am - all old couples instead of the large groups of rowdy college kids who show up at night. And then since it was a Wednesday, I went off to my internship and he went off to his summer class like it was just a normal day. There was something really magical about waking up so early to spend time with someone when the rest of the world prefers to just roll out of bed and head off to their daily obligations.

A year later, long after we'd ended things we watched another sunrise together, this time from a nearby graveyard after staying up all night talking after everyone else had left his  going away party.

He is the only person I've ever watched a sunrise with. A sunset can be romantic with anyone, but you need a certain kind of person to share a sunrise. It was a strange and wonderful friendship/relationship."

temp9876,BabyBumps,1390326587.0,"From the article, the added costs of caring for cloth are about $20 per month so you have to add the initial cost of the cloth diapers + $240 for the first year.  Disposables are about $0.20 each which is about $550 for the first year.  So the cost comparison really can't be made until you know how much the initial cost of cloth is.  Even if you make your own, I think $200 is a reasonably conservative estimate after a quick google, looks like it could be way more than that too, so for the first year:

Cloth $440  vs  Disposable $550.  So you're paying an extra $2 per week for the convenience.  That is not a significant difference.

Extrapolating those costs to age 2 or 3 will make a difference, but that difference depends on whether you have to replace any of the cloth, get larger sizes, and especially whether you end up using a combo of cloth and disposables to accommodate childcare and other caregivers.  Larger disposables are more expensive, but you go through fewer of them, so that cost doesn't increase as much as you might expect.

I will absolutely concede that in the super-long run, assuming you use them for multiple children and don't make significant purchases of additional cloth diapers after your initial purchase, cloth is cheaper.  It's just not as big a difference as people think and it takes a lot of time to realize it.  Lots of people don't realize what cloth actually costs because it doesn't show up on the weekly grocery bill.  Like you said, cost is a factor for most people, so isn't it better to have real numbers when making the choice?"

eetsumkaus,malefashionadvice,1390326700.0,"all of art is an appropriation of something else. Just because something started out as something else originally doesn't mean it can't be anything else to anybody down the road. Peacoats, Duffle coats, M-65s, M-51s are all staples of menswear that have been appropriated from the military. Mopeds have become a symbol of mod culture when they originally started out as personal transportation. Punks take on biker jackets without any idea that the original notion for that was to echo the original 1950s ""greaser"" look, and even then, most of *those* guys they take inspiration from never rode bikes. Let's not forget that what we know now as plimsolls started out as tennis shoes as well. It really just is where you draw inspiration from.

Ultimately, it boils down to this: What does ""authentic"" mean? Is it looking like what society expects you to look like given certain traits, or is it looking like how *you* want to look? Association with different aesthetics is ultimately a completely random thing. Bracelets can just as easily be associated with Latin American beach culture as it is with New England yachting. 

You're right, one should be aware of the cultural associations of something, such as a Westerner wearing chinese characters that read ""lick my pussy"", just because they think it looks good, or wearing a Yankees hat when they don't even know what a home run is. But many of the associations you stated are much weaker than these, and so it doesn't quite matter how out of place they are"

Thingscannotgetworse,Parenting,1390326837.0,"She's fine at daycare they haven't mentioned anything about this, but they're very involved in teaching these things like putting the toys away so I don't think it would stand out. There's also no sink inside the section she stays in as it's the for the youngest children so I don't think she could make hand washing a concern there. She regularly has problems getting enough to eat there though which may be because of how hard it is sometimes to feed her in the ""right"" way.

She isn't having any problems socially either, we always get told about how she is playing with others, that she strokes their face when they get upset things like that. She has a special friend there too she speaks of him a lot, and we got told she wakes him up at nap times by saying his name when she gets up.

She loves the bath, she has lots of toys there because we moved all the toys for her sandcastle to bathtime since she hated it so much. She likes watching water pour or the shower, and likes to touch it the most. She shampoos her hair a lot too, but she *hates* having her hair rinsed which creates problems. She doesn't like getting dressed when she's wet at all, nor the towel. We just pat her a bit and put a dressing gown &amp; nappy on her.

I think it's a mix, though her reactions to cold are really strong. She was sitting with her dad and he touched her face, his hands were chilly because he'd been outside and she grabbed it and wrenched it away from her face. She got upset after that and kept rubbing the area that had been touched.

I think that would work definitely, I hadn't thought of using temperature at all. She was really not into peeled veggies so maybe we would have better luck with unpeeled. 

She has blocks but she takes them out and just takes the trolley they came in for a walk. When she was younger she'd knock them down if I built them and laugh but now she doesn't use them at all.

You're probably going to build up whatever person you date in your mind as being very exceptional/special rather than another normal person that you're in a relationship with.

If your standard of evidence on the one hand is in line with scientific consensus (rejecting non-religious pseudoscience as readily and easily as anyone else) but you still maintain cosmologically significant beliefs based on old stories and personal feelings, there's clearly a special category being created within the mind to protect religiosity. 
  
In terms of evidence the only thing that sets one religion apart from another is how many claims were made. We're talking about a conglomeration of culturally universal phenomenon chiefly centered around magical thinking. We know that this exists in all known human cultures in a multitude of diverse forms with specific similar elements, and we know that the details of these various belief systems most certainly do not agree with one another. How, then, if we were to apply the same standards of evidence to ourselves that we supposedly apply to the world around us, would we not easily see that any religious fervor in ourselves is quite obviously just one more example of a particular type of culturally endorsed delusion that human beings are *very* susceptible to? The only answer is that for whatever reason those who don't see it as delusion are applying a different standard of evidence to their own magical beliefs in order to maintain psychological comfort. To what contexts that's adaptive or maladaptive aside, it's certainly not what I'd call reconciliation, and it's certainly not intellectually honest.

I also don't think this game differs as much from d2 as most people say, but that's just my opinion. You put your own emphasis on different things, and I guess a lot of the stuff they removed from d2, or added, weren't really things I identified d2 with."

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1390327717.0,"&gt; I hope it would be made somehow monetary wise better than bitcoin. Bitcoin currently is monetary wice excactly like gold. It's hoarded because it gains value if you just keep it safe and it's traded because it has some value stability because of the hoarders. And it's hoarder more because the of the trade and traded more because it's hoarded more and that goes on and on.

I'm not a fan of bitcoin and would want a UBI coin structured much differently. Bitcoin encourages hoarding and concentration of 'wealth' as it were in the way they derive value and are created. My thought is to have a UBI coin supply that is a multiple of the number of individuals participating. 

Suppose for each individual that joins 1,000 UBI coins are created. Each month distribute newly created coins along with tax revenues. So, if in month 1 there are 1,000 individuals the total coin supply would be 1M. After month 2 suppose it doubled to 2,000 that would double the supply of coins to 2M. These coins could be distributed over time paying UBI. 

Eventually UBI would need to be almost entirely covered by taxation as the rate of growth in money supply would be small relative to participants. This is the test bed for all the possible competing ideas on how to finance a UBI. 

For instance the flat transaction tax that is popular in this sub could be tested. I tend to think it would discourage activity at sizable levels and at the very least would require ramping up time.

Perhaps a wealth tax may be imposed to finance UBI payments. Possibly a progressive rate based on the number of coins created for each individual participating. Were that 1,000 coins each in the money supply the wealth tax might sensibly tax much higher the further over that level one goes, which would discourage hoarding.

Anyway, this sort of idea is basically a means of establishing a UBI participant network that could be global. It wouldn't require governments to get started and valuable data could be acquired. The problem as with all currencies is you're left with developing a monetary, tax and distribution policy while trying to foster productive economic activity. Difficult business to say the least.

Regardless of age American men seem to literally ""walk tall"", there is just like you said a bit of a farm boy swagger that they carry.

They've given a certain interpretation of the picture and what it supposedly says, but it seems like they've missed details.  The man hanging from her heel isn't some helpless man being crushed underfoot, he's dropped his tiny campaign sign and made a futile attempt to stop her.  That's a more positive message.  She is a powerful figure, an intimidating one, and it seems counter intuitive to criticize the media for portraying her that way, it sounds almost like complaining that they aren't depicting her in a gentler and more ladylike way.  The now iconic Obama ""Hope"" poster is not depicting a friendly everyday guy you could have a beer with, and it isn't meant to.  The POTUS is often referred to as ""the most powerful man in the world"", would it be doing Hillary a favor to depict her as anything less than powerful when she aspires to that position?

With that being said, I didn't invest a lot of money in a ton of graphics cards so my initial investment would not really be overshadowed by the rise of an ASIC.)

I think that from a recognition perspective, adding ASICs would boost the legitimacy of Litecoin. The most products/services there are, the more legitimate the currency becomes. It isn't just ASICs, if the news media talks about it more, if more companies started accepting it as payment, and if a bank or two figures out what to do with it, Litecoin will finally ""arrive"" and I think it will force the value upwards.

And for every correlation unless it is a 100% correlation it can not be taken as causation.  Even then a 100% correlation has to be looked very very carefully to make sure.

The problem I see here is that Nutanyahoo only needs one head of state or federal government 110% in his fold for he and the rest of the Likud-Beneitu people to believe that they have carte blanche to act however they see fit, no matter what anyone else says.

I think this certainly hinges on the neurosis surrounding the concept of anti Semitism and Israel's habit of throwing the term around as a way to attack whenever it feels like it.

Nutanyahoo can easily simply accuse everyone else of being ""anti Semitic"" or otherwise hateful as long as he has one foreign entity backing whatever he does. It would actually really tie into the Israeli ""Jews are perpetual victims and perpetually persecuted"" motif."
hylandw,DnD,1390329906.0,"Lay down the law. Otherwise, if they're just playful, I'd say calmly fuck with them.

I have three PCs: One long-time friend who generally wants to fuck shit up (while also loving the game)(i.e. he tried to jack off during combat). One other best friend who's long-time friends with the long-time friend who does the same, but does it right (i.e. crazy, but makes sense with alignment and does it in a respectful (to the game) way), and one who plays normally.

Long-time friend gets cocky (he's the powerful member of the party). He says to bring on a black dragon.

I do.

When they argue, calmly wait until they're done, and then say that when they were talking, a thief picked their pockets.

When they meta game, meta game back. They want to break character and look at it like a math challenge? Make it mathematically challenging, and make it easier if they RP.

They want good items? Give the item a curse.

They break alignment? Give it an alignment penalty.

yes, absolutely, the whole point of reviews is to be able to make an informed purchasing decision, and the biggest piece of that by far is ""which one should i buy?"" (followed by ""do i really need it?"").

First of all, I'm tired of people simply viewing it as a label. Yes, it is that, but it's so much more. It's an identity and an explanation and a resource and more. I knew I was different from at least kindergarten - and so did everyone else. It's just that no one knew what or why. I was finally diagnosed when I was 30, and spent my life until then knowing I was different, knowing things were hard but not knowing why, and it was awful. 

Having the ""label"" meant taking these various things about myself that made it look like I was just a bucket of issues, and turning them into a cohesive identity and *who I am*. I was finally able to make real progress on understanding my triggers and moving forwards and getting the kind of help I needed, and I was also able to move forwards in terms of self-acceptance. I no longer try to force myself to be someone I'm not in some hope that I'll be happy if I'm like everyone else. Instead I accept myself the way I am and I am much much happier for it. I am also learning to navigate the world as myself rather than as what other people think I should be. 

Being young was a struggle. It would have been a struggle no matter what, but proper identification of what was going on and proper help probably would have been a great benefit to me."

My other tobacco from them is the Sunset Cavendish. I switch between the 2 during the day. If you're into the pipe tobacco flavors, it's pretty killer. Cavendish and caramel. It's got an RY4 thing going on but nowhere near as sweet.

Went to a party with my then-girlfriend and my then-best friend. Loads of my friends there. She's pretty comfortable so I leave her to her own devices; this was for her to meet my friends, not for me to helicopter around her. Spends most of it slightly drunk with my best friend.

Next day, I'm dumped. She says it's because I don't like screamo and horror movies (I didn't want to watch Human Centipede with her one time). I was a bit confused but shrugged it off.

Few weeks later, my best friend asks if he can talk to her. He's a colossal womaniser and has cheated with several girls in the past (which I always give him flak for), and so I get on his case a bit, and got him to promise nothing happened at the party. He says nothing, all moves on.

About three months later, I'm at another party. Drunk truth or dare, and one drunk girl asks how I feel about my bestie and ex dating. I'm confused and everyone has this 'oh shit' look. I get taken to the side and told they've been dating pretty much since I was dumped. Every single one of my 'friends' knew, but didn't tell me a bloody thing. They all say nothing happened at the party and nobody cheated, but I really can't trust anything they say.

Funny thing is, my ex-best friend tried cheating on my ex with another girl; trying to kiss her, cutting himself if she didn't date him, etc... My 'friends' deny this ever happened to her, and I get some laughs out of it. They're still dating after seven months."

iloveteax,AskWomen,1390330743.0,"Sex in and of itself does not ""bond"" me to a person in any way. What creates a bond for me is the relationship that accompanies the sex. If I have sex with a man who I know I don't want to date, there will be no bind; I'll simply have my fun and leave, and maybe have a friendship afterward. But if I'm actually dating a guy and I grow to like him as a person, then sex will definitely form a special bond between us and it will likely cause me to develop stronger feelings for him, especially if the sex was good.

But, that's just me. I personally don't see sex as being a big deal at all so long as both parties protect themselves and act responsibly. Some people see sex differently, though, and for those people, sex may genuinely seem like ""giving themselves"" to someone else. It all depends on personal views and the culture you grew up in. "

Your self-summary is your most important part and your weakest. There is nothing there but a string of adjectives and cliches (particularly laid-back). It's not offensive or off putting, but it also isn't inviting or particularly stimulating. The other parts are really strong and insightful with specific examples and could probably stand on their own with a blank self-summary until you can come up with something better to go there.

PlushieChomby,relationships,1390330809.0,"This is the best solution by far, but if I could just add a tiny suggestion: don't spring the conversation on her, do give her a bit of a heads up that it's coming. Say you know the two of you will be having lunch together that day, in the morning simply tell her something like, ""Hey (name or petname), I know you've got some issues with me getting my bike, and I'd like to hear you out and get a good idea of how you feel as well as tell you how I feel, so I thought we could have that conversation at lunch today but I wanted to give you time to gather your thoughts before we do."" Give her a kiss or a hug or whatever, let her know you have no intention of it being a hostile takeover conversation, and you've given her the gift of being able to put together what she'd like to say. Hopefully that means she'll be less frantic or emotional, though if her friend died in an accident years ago there may be emotion anyway, but it'll be less than if it's suddenly a conversation happening she didn't know about and can't escape. 

Then make the conversation happen, be clear that you've taken the riding course, gotten the endorsement on your license, and really want to make this happen. Hear her out, soothe her over where you can, and offer to do things like take her shopping with you where she can ask questions and maybe have some of her fears resolved by the salesmen rather than solely coming from you. It sounds like her main concern is you getting hurt or possibly even losing you, but honestly as long as you don't drive it like an idiot and take extra precautions in the rain (when other cars on the road are really the issue, not you) you'll be fine. Offer to take her on a ride (pick somewhere safe and easy, not a ton of hills and/or sharp turns) so she can get a feel for herself if you think it's a wise idea and won't inflate her fear.

Robert's claim to the throne was also based on the fact that his grandmother was the daughter of Aegon V. I mean, he still took power via right of conquest, but the fact that the Baratheons did have some Targaryen blood gave them extra legitimacy over the other families that rebelled with them."

aDDnTN,Triumph,1390330855.0,"&gt; Would you walk into a dealership and ask to see the hooligan models?

maybe? but i probably wouldn't walk in and ask to see their streetfighter or naked models, unless those naked models were real women, amiright? :D

but i am beginning to see a *new* ""genre"" of motorcycles, the hooligan bikes. Upright control unfaired sportsbikes, as overpowered for the street as the SS's, but with controls to provide greater leverage and superior street handling characteristics, so that you can better APPLY that redonkulous power and torque to the gentle roads.

OK, since we are putting things in boxes, the box that Streetfighters fit into for me is a SB that's been stunted, had some shit ground off (the hard way), so the owner fixed that and made it harder to grind off. maybe it's got handlebars, but probably not. Think stripped fairings on a gixxer. 

which is where i would put a speedy with clipons. but get crazy enough with the mods, and maybe it becomes a nuCafe? imo, cafe bikes are a purist-modded vintage bike. they have to meet the profile and needs, and retain the vintage asthetic. too much of what is labeled cafe is really a bobber rat or vintage ratbike. nuCafe would be cafe'ng a modern FI bike into a racer style.

Furthermore, IMO, the difference between a streetfighter and a hooligan, is that the hooligan bike came that way from the factory and what you buy is the intent of the designers in every way. everything else might be the same.

Daytona 1050 (of my dreams) with Speed3 parts bolted on and everything ""superfluous"" stripped off, would be a Streetfighter, NOT a hooligan bike.

Just semantics, but maybe i/we/they have there terms crossed, since a streetfighter might have more ""pedigree"" than a hooligan?

&gt; OP was using his bike as a hooligan would, perhaps it is his bike of choice for hooning.

Who said you can't hoon any other genre of bike? i've seen some Harley's and once a Royal Enfield hooned. i don't think you are saying this, but i'm making the point that ""hoonable"" isn't a requirement.

i'm beginning to see you ""usage defines the name/genre"" point. imo, streetfighter is/was/and will always be (ab)used for stunts or stupidity. obviously a stunt bike (whatever it was prior) is defined by the usage, ergo.."

sockmonkeysaurus,relationships,1390330891.0,"&gt;he said ""sorry"" again, and then said he was ""sorry I can't accept sorry as his apology.""

Just saying 'sorry' is a cop out. More often than not, you're just throwing a single word at someone to get them off your back. A genuine apology usually includes *why* the person is sorry, and shows that they recognize that they've done something hurtful. Saying ""I'm sorry for invading your privacy, it won't happen again"" is an apology. It shows remorse and understanding towards your hurt feelings. 'Sorry' can be taken as a brush off response, like 'sorry you're mad', or 'sorry I was caught', or in your ex's case 'sorry you can't accept sorry as an apology'.

Change all of your passwords. And use this as another reason for why you guys are broken up. He's not showing remorse for invading your privacy, and is trying to make you feel bad for being (righteously) upset."

I want to marry her, but if she had asked me to propose to her before we could move in, I don't know if we would be living together right now.

 IMO, if you expect someone to propose to you, it has to be on their terms, and theirs alone. 

But it isn't needed. Being engaged isn't some commitment tier level. It doesn't mean a promise of a long term relationship. An engagement can end just as quickly as a relationship without one (trust me I just watched it happen), and I think rushing it will only help to that end. The only true promise of a long term relationship is a marriage, as far as I see it. 

You used the term ""the long run"". Let it **be** a long run. You sound like you don't want to rush him, and that's cool.  But at the same time it's ok to say ""I would like to be engaged/married by x"", so long as you know x isn't too soon for him. 

 If you don't want to share expenses with someone that's simple. Don't. Keep things as separate as you are comfortable. Split things right down the middle. Keep things documented. Sure, some things will be shared, but if things turn you can figure that out. 

OK, my job is kicking me out due to the storm, so to TL;DR: Don't hesitate to tell him you want to move in together and why. Don't hesitate to tell him you don't want to be in his place. I'd say hesitate on the engagement part. If you need it to feel secure moving in, it seems to me you aren't ready to move in. "

In the last partial cause of the problem higher wages might actually cause the problem to get marginally worse. Obviously it wont cause the world to end but making the jobs more attractive to the next level up might actually make it worse for the people who have 0 skills and just entering the work force.

You talked about the difficulties individuals feel when  using 100% of your energy simply to stay afloat and that it would be nice if they could spare some for future improvement but that is actually my view on a social scale.

Say yes. Always say yes. Don't be afraid to say ""yes, but"" and don't be afraid to say ""That's going to almost definitely get you killed/attacked/exiled, but you can roll if you like"".

James_GAF,AskMenOver30,1390331279.0,"&gt; However, even though I'm actively dating, I don't seem to get beyond a few dates (if that) before I have to answer the question about my dating history, and I feel like my lack of experience in this area is really sabotaging my hopes of finding someone, as it seems like as soon as this information comes out, guys find a reason to end things.

Sounds like a correlation, but not a causal link. A handful of dates is the time during which people decide if they actually want a longer relationship. This seems to be a point of insecurity for you, but realize there are dozens of other factors at play in whether someone wants to continue dating you. While it might be a factor I'd hardly call a sparse dating history deterministic in most cases.

Are you finding yourself attached early on, but having the relationships ended? Are you not at least mutually ending some or choosing to end some yourself?

How are you getting these dates? Some of it may be you're just not connecting with very compatible men."

&gt;""Any penalties signaled during the period of time between the apparent goal and the next stoppage of play shall be assessed in the normal manner, except when a minor penalty is to be assessed to the team scored upon, and is therefore nullified by the scoring of the goal.  Refer to Rules 16.2 and 18.2.  If an infraction happens after the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal (infraction after the whistle) by either team, it is assessed and served in the normal manner regardless as to the decision rendered by the Video Goal Judge.""

If Team A scores a goal, but it is not seen on the ice and play is not stopped, and Team B takes a penalty that causes a stoppage, then the penalty would be nullified if it is a minor penalty. All other penalties would start at the time of goal, and the missed time would be replayed."

Renner1,canada,1390331437.0,"I'm going to quote from a transcript of the speech itself-- some blog by David Akin:

&gt;&gt; First, Canada finds it deplorable that some in the international community still question the legitimacy of the existence of the state of Israel.

&gt;&gt; Our view on Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state is absolute and non-negotiable.


usual Harper crap, how dare anyone question Israel's premise, Jewish rights to have a Jewish state take precedent.

&gt;&gt; Third, we refuse to single out Israel for criticism on the international stage.

Harper being delusional and pretending that the world ""bullies"" Israel.

&gt;&gt; But, in much of the western world, the old hatred has been translated into more sophisticated language for use in polite society.

&gt;&gt; People who would never say they hate and blame the Jews for their own failings or the problems of the world, instead declare their hatred of Israel and blame the only Jewish state for the problems of the Middle East.

&gt;&gt; As once Jewish businesses were boycotted, some civil-society leaders today call for a boycott of Israel.

&gt;&gt; On some campuses, intellectualized arguments against Israeli policies thinly mask the underlying realities, such as the shunning of Israeli academics and the harassment of Jewish students.

&gt;&gt; Most disgracefully of all, some openly call Israel an apartheid state.

&gt;&gt; Think about that.

&gt;&gt; Think about the twisted logic and outright malice behind that: a state, based on freedom, democracy and the rule of law, that was founded so Jews can flourish, as Jews, and seek shelter from the shadow of the worst racist experiment in history, that is condemned, and that condemnation is masked in the language of anti-racism.

&gt;&gt; It is nothing short of sickening.

&gt;&gt; But this is the face of the new anti-Semitism.

&gt;&gt; It targets the Jewish people by targeting Israel and attempts to make  the old bigotry acceptable for a new generation.


Here's the big turd in the punchbowl, where he bleats about ""new anti-Semitism"" and the ""poor maligned victimized Israelis"" and all the same garbage he's been peddling to Jewish Canadians and assorted Arab-haters alike since he became PM-- a full rehashing of lies, damned lies, and Israeli lies.

Also pretty bad how he tries to claim that he speaks for Canadians in general."

Since they are often dirt bike based/ intended to be able to take on trails they have a much higher seat height. *Some* more aggressive sport bikes might also give you flat foot problems.

However, each bike is different and you may fit on some and not others. With anything bike sizing related, try and sit on the bike before making a decision. You can also look into getting a shaved seat/lowering links if you are really set on a specific bike. Seat shaving will have the least impact on the bikes performance, but can make the ergonomics a bit odd. Lowering links can mess with a bikes handling if not properly set up, but preserve the overall ergonomics of the bike.

She sounds like an introvert, and you sound a lot more extroverted. Part of being in a relationship is making compromises for the other person. It sounds like you compromise in terms of how frequently you spend time with her, but it seems she isn't compromising in terms of doing the things you want to do.

avatar_aang_,dogemining,1390331732.0,"First -- a higher hahsrate means it's harder for any one person to mine DOGE.  Every minute, roughly 500k coins are found.  Your percentage of the total hashrate is the cut you get.  So if the network power doubles, but your power stays the same, your income has halved.

ASIC stands for ""Application Specific Integrated Circuit"" -- In this context we're talking about specialized hardware built specifically for mining.  These literally destroyed GPU mining for bitcoin, because surprise, surprise the ASICs are much more power efficient than GPUs.  They spiked the difficulty so hard that mining with a GPU wouldn't even pay for the electricity.

For now, Dogecoin is safe because it uses a different hashing algorithm (Scrypt) than Bitcoin (SHA256).  Since Scrypt requires a lot of memory to run, it's much harder to create ASICs for it.  Right now the general consensus is that they may come, but it will be a long time before they're so efficient that GPU mining isn't worth it."

ciov3r,changemyview,1390331926.0,"The thing is, in a customer service field, service for the customer is your job. While the technical aspects of the job are important ('ability to get the job done'), many jobs such as those in the restaurant industry include 'help the customer have an *enjoyable* experience'. It's not just about serving their food. The server's mannerisms, for example, can make or break the experience.

Now don't get me wrong, the 'customer is always right' mindset is definitely blown out of proportion sometimes in the service industry. However, a customer expecting a pleasant, friendly, professional serviceman/woman isn't really all that crazy. And you, as a professional in that industry, should understand that this demeanor is expected of you. You are an extension of the company you're working for- the front line who's dealing with the customers face to face. As such, your goals are the company's goals. If the company's goal is to provide smiling, friendly, personable service... that's what you were hired to do.

A worker who disregards formalities and gets the job done can be an asset. But not as much in a position that deals directly with customers. Those people tend to work better within a company rather than as the footmen. If I had my way, I'd always be in those positions.

That said, I can certainly turn into the smiling happy-to-help-professional when required. It just goes with the territory. Customers react better to it, and I wouldn't say it's entirely because of the ""customer is right"" attitude... it's just social etiquette, and people naturally react well to it. "

Renner1,CanadaPolitics,1390332088.0,"&gt; I was going to say something along the lines of ""Hamas needs to go if we want any progress because we need to have a more moderate and unified Palestine if there's to be any negotiations or deal"" but then again it always seems like something gets in the way and Abbas isn't all sunshine and rainbows either. I don't know what exactly is going to help there, but deep religious divides and poor economic conditions/standards of living sure make it hard to get anywhere. Palestine needs some sort of functioning economy before I think we see the end of the likes of Hamas.


I want to ask you an honest question, I suppose you can cite me if you like.

Have you ever considered that the main impediment to actually getting the peace process properly up and running is related to how Israel behaves, or specific Israeli actions?

Because all I see is ""Hamas this, PA that"" or ""Hamas has to disappear before it can work, but Abbas (effectively browbeaten by all the pro-Israel sycophants on the international level) isn't much better"".

You realize that Israel actively screws with the Palestinian economy, right?

You realize that bombing Gaza into mush isn't going to magically make people in Gaza think ""yeah let's get rid of Hamas and go hold hands with the benevolent Israelis"", right?

I mean, I think Hamas is a poor show as far as Palestinian resistance organizations go, but they did enough in the way of providing services in Gaza when Fatah was at its lowest, and they're obviously not using Gazans as human shields-- why would the Gazans put up with that, on top of everything else they have to?"

It's true that the battery does not charge below 3500. This is normal for many bikes. If you are riding normally and not spending most of your time sitting at idle you should be fine.

marinersalbatross,science,1390332532.0,"I was on Bu for a bit and yeah it helps but I still drank to oblivion as well because it wasn't enough.  So me and the doc kept bouncing around until I now have a heavy dose of quetiapine (aka seroqual) at night and then a light dose of Lamotrogine in the morning. It has helped immensely, in fact it gave me the strength to stop drinking. Sleeping with it is great, sudden black sleep with few dreams. And I've now been sober for 1 year as of middle of January. It's also helped calm me enough to go back to therapy. Not perfect, and I'm probably going to get a booster soon; but an enormous difference.

All great men are unreasonable.""

I guess the way I follow it is based on importance. If you have a family member who is unwavering in their attitude towards _x_ group, you may find it's not worth arguing. Like there's really no gain to trying to convince your 80 year old grandma that saying Obama is ""surprisingly well spoken for a black man"" is racist. On this topic, it's pointless making ""kitschy little drop collage[s] in photoshop, with no visible sources for the 'facts' presented."" Really, keeping a blog on Tumblr about SJW is insanely worthless.

At the same time, one should be a bit unreasonable about certain near unchangeable things. If someone is angry about the American prison system, then they most certainly should petition against it, even though they may well see no change in their own lifetime.

But I guess they do address this &gt;when change may be possible only at great cost or risk.

[Tater tot casserole!](http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/00/94/53/945371.jpg)

Makes ~6-8 servings

Ingredients

1 lb. lean ground beef
1/2 medium onion, chopped (I sometimes prefer to add 1/2 tablespoon onion powder to the beef as it cooks)
1 10 1/2-oz. can of condensed cream of chicken, mushroom, or celery (chicken is definitely my favorite)
1 16 oz. package frozen tater tots
salt
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (optional)
1 15.25-oz. can of veggies (optional, most commonly used are green beans or corn)


1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. 
2. Brown ground beef in skillet, season with salt to taste. Add chopped onion or 1/2 Tbsp. onion powder. Cook until onions are tender or meat is browned; drain grease.
3. In dish, combine browned beef and cream of soup mix; stir. If you are using veggies, stir those in as well.
4. Top mixture with tater tots. (my favorite part!)
5. Bake, uncovered, for 30-40 minutes until bubbly and tater tots are golden brown. 
6. Remove from oven and top with cheese if using it, put back in oven until it's melted.

Enjoy! My mom made this all the time when I was a kid and I love it. The only downside IMO is that it takes a while to cook. Also, I sometimes grab a 32 oz bag of tater tots instead plus 2 1-lb. things of ground beef/2 cans of cream of whatever so I can make it again at some point in the future.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1390332941.0,"I can't say whether you're overreacting or not, it's a very personal thing.  I know from experience that I can ""doze"" when I need to, I'm still getting a good sleep but when the right trigger happens I'm aware.  I'm ordinarily a very deep sleeper but I discovered when I was in the army that when I sleep knowing that I could be awoken abruptly and need to act on X, I won't have any trouble doing just that.  That doesn't mean I wasn't sleeping, but the right trigger, nearby footsteps, a specific signal, even while mostly asleep my brain reacted to them and I was awake.

Since I knew that from experience before we had a baby, I was comfortable with my level of awareness having the baby in bed nursing with me.  A change in rhythm would alert me instantly, any change in position and I checked on him immediately.  Co-sleeping and nighttime nursing in that manner was a really wonderful time for me, and very effective.  While I was doing that my husband was in bed, checking on us anytime we moved, dozing and keeping watch.  It was a team effort.

That said, it won't work for everyone.  There are good reasons why they recommend against it, you don't want to learn you're a deeper or more restless sleeper than you thought because you've accidentally suffocated your baby.  You've got to talk it through.  If you are that uncomfortable, a compromise might be for you to get a cosleeper bed that can be right next to her, you move baby in and out of it and you observe her while she's nursing.  It gives you peace of mind without disturbing her sleep and their routine too much.

It's not at all unusual to be terrified of something bad happening.  Even years later I can still terrify myself with ""what ifs"" every time he leaves the house.  But you have to evaluate your options rationally and remember that you're part of a team, sometimes you've got to trust each other."

Not_Han_Solo,Netrunner,1390332944.0,"I've been accused of mis-analyzing Armitage Codebusting in the past, but I'll repeat here what I've said before.

Armitage Codebusting looks better than it is.  It seems to offer 11 credits over 7 clicks, which seems a great deal.  In reality, this is a false comparison, because you can always just click for one credit.  As a result, for *any* economy card, you should only examine the credits you get from an economy card over the baseline of one credit per click. I wouldn't count the cost of drawing the card, because that draw is blind, and because that cost is static across all economy cards.

By this metric:

AC costs 1 credit and 1 click to install, and fully resolves over the course of 6 clicks.  Thus, with those 7 clicks, you could have just clicked for 7 credits.  You paid 1 for Codebusting, so your total opportunity cost for Armitage Codebusting is 8 credits that you could have earned otherwise.  AC pays 12 credits, and as a result, it's a total of +4 credits over your baseline over 7 clicks.

MO, by comparison, has a much larger sunk cost, and is obviously inferior to AC over the 6-click lifespan of AC.  However, MO survives, and in point of fact has the potential to be the only economy card you ever need.  That's why it has seen much more use overall than AC.

The reason, correspondingly, that MO's use has declined in recent months is because of the presence of Professional Contacts.  PC doesn't burst economy on its own nearly as well as MO, but it's more versatile, as sometimes you need the credit and sometimes you need the card, but regardless you always get the other as a bonus.  Most folks run other stuff, like Sure Gamble, as bonus economy, and PC digs them up much more easily than you would get them otherwise.  Secondly, PC doesn't require memory to continue to exist, and is not vulnerable to Archer."

&gt;To OP: He doesn't see you as an ally, so he doesn't want to talk to you.

I agree, and I think it's possible to slowly remedy this with some of the suggestions other posters have given, like showing your own book to him. I would also, if you can, demonstrate a positive response right away -- see if you can see the cover or title or author or topic or genre or anything of the book BEFORE you talk to him. Then, instead of asking him what he's reading (which, for me, would have immediately turned me paranoid as to why you wanted to know -- will I be in trouble for reading? because it just never occurred to me, especially at a young age, that ""socialization"" is a valid purpose for asking about someone's actions), happily observe: ""oh, you're reading a book about [whatever]! Oh, I like [whatever]. I read a book about [whatever] once and it was really cool! I'm glad we have books about [whatever] so you can read them and enjoy them."" And then smile again and walk away. 

It might confuse him, but the following two things happened: you knew what book he was reading, and you were happy about it. Nothing bad happened. And in some cases that will open him up to you right away, some cases you may have to do that several times to get him okay with it (you might build up to asking him directly by injecting simple questions like ""I like [whatever]. Do you like [whatever]?"" And just letting him answer yes before giving him a big smile and leaving him alone), some  cases he might not open up to you at all and you have to try something else, but in my experience it will at best uncondition the fear response, and worst confuse him briefly.

Zagaroth,askscience,1390333296.0,"because the points are getting spread further out. It's almost more accurate (from a certain Point of View) to say the box is being pushed to be larger by the creation of more points of space.

In a static space, a light wave would cover 1 light-year of distance in a single year (it's the definition after all). And with in areas with enough gravitational binding between objects, they maintain their distance and everything is fine.

But between galaxies, it gets really weird. Over the course of the year, more space is slowly welling into existence. which means things that were x light years apart are now slightly more than X light years apart. 

When crossing however many points of space a light wave crosses in a given moment, there's slightly more points that it's crossed than were there when it started crossing. so a 1nm wave is now a 1.0000000000001 nm wave. This extra tiny bit of infinitesimally small space stretched into existence as the light was passing through it, thus stretching the light wave,and the light wave simply retains its shape. This is what redshifting is (see[ Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) )

This isn't a perfectly accurate description, but it's close enough. 

FOr even shorter hand: The increasing growth of space is effectively increasing the speed at which objects are moving apart, which is effectively the same as the doppler effect"

Zelena - kakve sad veze crnci u Africi imaju sa temom u pitanju? Takođe, možda grešim, ali white boy takođe može biti rasistički naziv, zavisno od konteksta u kom je kazano. Zašto uopšte obraćati se nekom na osnovu rase, nacije (osim ako ga lično znaš, pa u šali)? Kilavi argumenti, ali hajde, valjda joj poruka pokušala biti antirasistička.

Just a few tips that I learned the hard way,
Test your camera, speakers and microphone beforehand, make sure you do a test call so that you can come off as professional as possible.
Make sure the area that is in their view is clean and orderly. 
Make sure that if you live with other people they're aware of your interview so they don't make unnecessary noise or mess with the internet connection while you're in the middle of talking.
That's all the techniqual advice I can give.

As for the actual questions and answers, they are probably just as nervous as you. So go ahead and google ""au pair interview questions"" and you'll find the same lists that I'm sure they're googling as well.
If you've been emailing you may already have some of the more basic questions out of the way like your work experience, child care experience and a little bit about your personal past. I think that if they know all that about you already they just want to actually see you and put a human face with the emails that you've been exchanging. 

Just talk to them like normal, be yourself and I'm sure you'll breeze through the interview with flying colors!

ciov3r,changemyview,1390333616.0,"Polygamy? Sure, if all parties are legal age and consensual, I don't really have a good reason to tell someone they can't be married to multiple people. The only side I can see to this that might be questionable is how it affects certain benefits/etc given to married couples. I'm not sure the ins and outs, but it seems like things could be messier with polygamous marriages. This is not the case for a gay marriage involving 2 people. From a moral standpoint? Not my business.

Incest? Between consenting adults? Morally, not my business. The issue that should come up here is with reproduction, as there are huge legitimate genetic problems that can happen from incest. This is not the case for gay marriage of 2 people, and doesn't seem comparable. 

Pedophilia/etc? We have legal of-age definitions for consenting adults regarding sex. As long as this is the case, a 17-and-younger individual can not enter into ANY marriage, so I'm not sure how gay marriage is somehow linked to pedophilia/etc. 

Pre-arranged necrophilia? I'm not familiar with what the exact laws/regulations are for keeping a dead body laying around in your home for any reason... but I would think this would be far less about consenting relationships and more about health? WHY would this be in any way similar to gay marriage?

Bestiality? Animals can, at no point, be consensual in a sexual relationship with a human being. Not comparable. At all.

You will spend about R$500~600 in renting a place, if you would like to just rent an apartment based on that price, here is a few links to some places:

&gt;http://www.redeimoveisjoinville.com.br/detalhes.php?codigo=11864

R$600 for a small studio

&gt;http://www.redeimoveisjoinville.com.br/detalhes.php?codigo=34283

R$550 + 90 of condominium

You can see some pictures there, it is an empty place though, you would have to buy the furniture.

&gt;http://www.redeimoveisjoinville.com.br/detalhes.php?codigo=37960

R$550+ R$10 of condominium

You can see a full list here: http://www.redeimoveisjoinville.com.br/imoveis.php?finalidade=locacao&amp;de2=500&amp;&amp;ate2=750

I ranged the price between R$500 up to R$750, you could use google translate to get you around.

* Dinner/Lunch in a small restaurant (usually called ""prato feito"") around R$7~15.

At some places, you can eat until you can't stand it anymore, the prices are low, but do not expect great quality, the food looks like the one you do at home, but it is eatable.

* Beer depends on the brand but it varies from R$2 up to R$6.

Trips to great cities nearby:

* Joinville to Balneario Camborio (Awesome beaches): R$27 one way (R$55 round-trip)

* Joinville to Curitiba (Very europe-like city 2 hour trip, worth visiting: R$23 round-trip.

* Joinville to Florianopolis (State's capital, very big city, beautiful to visit): R$51 round-trip.

Internet cost per month:(first three months the prices are these, but they rise about 10~20% after that)

* Internet 120MB/s: 319.90/m
* Internet 30MB/s: R$89.90/m
* Internet 10MB/s: R$59.90/m


If you will eat at home, buy groceries, toilet paper, tooth brusher, you know all things you usually buy at the supermakert for the month, expect something around R$150~250, depending on the supermakert and your personal tastes. 


Breaking all that down:

R$1300/month:

* R$500/m (rentment)
* R$200/m (supermakert stuff for the month)
* R$59.90/m (decent internet)
* R$320/m (eating out + beer, fun)

Total: R$1080.00

Light + water + gas bill all depends on the place you rent, some will offer, some you will have to pay.

So now, just do the Math, if you eat a lot, then you should consider lowering the rentment and living in a less decent place, if you want a better place to live, decrease the amount of things you spend on food, fun, if you like faster internet.... etc.

I hope I was helpful :)"

My wife and I are the same way.  She is Christian Reformed and I am well me.  After getting to know me(after breaking up a few times over religion) for who I am we learned morally we are very similar.  We might not agree over faith but in real life faith plays such a small roll in everyday life it might as well not be there at all.

We have had the children discussion many times.  I agreed to get the kids baptized.  It's show for family and friends...most of us here were baptized as babies.  Really no harm there.   Sunday school?  No problem...sure they can go, but she has agreed if they want to stop going the kids can stay home with me.  We will not force our kids to go to church.  

Her parents are not allowed to teach our children religion...that is up to us.  We have agreed that if her parents/family utter even one word that I am going to hell...they will be cut off from thier grandchildren.  We had an issue with my sister in law a while back...We didn't see her for over 6 months.  She was still living with my inlaws, we did nto visit thier house and never invited her over.  We would make sure to invite her parents over...but never her.  They brought her over one day with her...with my wifes support we stood our ground.  Until she relented in her pride and apologized for her comments.

My iwfe has agreed to make sure we will teach our children about all faiths in a fair and balanced manner.  We will teach our children real science...and the Bible as stories only. Helps that my wife is a teacher...and we are Canadian...so the science education was never an issue.

You will have to agree to raise the kids Catholic and she will have to be ready that the kids won't want to be Catholic.  You will both have to agree that the kids will find thier own path eventually and who knows they might end up be Jehovah Witnesses, Muslim, Mormon, Sihks, or something else.  "

In any case, you should never attempt to medicate a diabetic unless you are absolutely certain that you are taking the right action (and the only way to do that is to test their blood sugar and be well-educated about diabetes).  Doing the wrong thing could kill him, so it's very important to be sure.  Call 911 before taking any action if you're dealing with an unconscious diabetic.

Also cookies are freakin' terrible for raising blood sugar fast, they take too long to digest.  It should be something that's basically pure simple sugars, such as starbursts, skittles, apple juice, etc."

Xcalibershard,Filmmakers,1390334274.0,"I THINK (think being key here) that what it means is these distributors actively search for films to pick up, i.e. ones that have already been made. They will trawl festivals and other things looking to snap up the next goldmine that's waiting to be ... well... heard of.

That doesn't mean they'll look at DVD submissions, they still need to be given a reason, such as attention from third parties and probably a conversation/presentation with producers. But it does mean they aren't working exclusively with major studio deals and block busters all the time, sure fire hits that cost 7-9 figure sums to distribute, the sort of thing where distribution is assured before the first draft is even completed.

Miramax was/is an archetype of this. They also (largely due to their major success), are the major perpetrators of the idea that these companies financially screw you. Largely because they do. They will take 100% of profits until their costs are covered. It's a very standard deal in film but good luck ever getting them to admit their costs have actually been covered, some companies have been known to lie and just chuck on an extra mil to the costs (through various expenses tricks).

That doesn't mean avoid them by any means, it just means you'll be lucky to see much money from them at all. But this is why they focus on indie films and unknown quantities, the sort of people that need that one chance to get noticed and start being able to contract in 6 figure commissions, to actually get themselves a good agent.

theHBIC,Teachers,1390334287.0,"Going to small school, I really got to explore the difference between age ranges. I got my degree in secondary ed, so I did observations in middle and in high school. I had every intention to teach high school; I wanted to coach debate and inspire kids to be their best, independent selves and blah blah blah. Fast forward to freshman year of college: two days into my first middle school observation and I was hooked. I never looked back after that; my certification is 5-12, as it has to be, but I have no intention to ever teach high school.

That's my bias. And what I want to tell you is that you won't know until you try. I would get into classrooms as soon as you can in college and just start feeling it out. There's really no other advice you can be given that will ensure that you make the right choice for you."

That's really risky though, even as a software developer, you  don't know who is going to actually be in the meeting (or even if you do, you may not know anything about them).  

I'm a software developer too, and I work for anywhere between 50 and 150 dollars an hour, some places you go into and you're negotiating with a guy in a Hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts next to an  MBA in a suit.  Since the MBA controls the money but has roughly the brain power of a 5th grader you're better off in a suit, talking past the MBA while throwing in some buzzwords, the MBA is dazzled and thinks you're one of the business guys and can help him meet his quarterly targets, and so offers more money, and the technical person realizes you just conned the MBA and loves you for it from day 1.

You can also do stuff like have a Tshirt on underneath, and if you get into the interview and everyone is in super casual attire, you can take off the dress shirt and jacket and say something to the effect of 'thank god, everywhere I've interviewed has been a bunch of guys in suits and that is definitely not me!'.

So drinks all around and at about 10pm we end up packing up and going to another town where the bars were open later. All guys went with the exception of 1 woman, a young Belgian gal whom i had never spent more than 3 minutes speaking with at any given time before that night. We hung out a bit and chatted, she inadvertently blocked me from spending an evening with a statuesque English gal i met at one of the bars. All in all a good farewell.

I woke up early the next morning (Saturday) and went into London for the day/night for a farewell wander. Next day (Sunday) when i got back to the hotel i was staying at i literally walked in the door and standing in the lobby was the little Belgian gal.  She looked gorgeous, just show stopping beautiful. 

She thought i would be spending my last day alone and thought that was sad.  So, she came to get me so we could go for a pint.

She was fairly nervous at first but settled in and we spent about 5 hours sitting in the back of a pub just talking about family, friends, work, Belgium, France, the UK, the states, school...the full spectrum of the usual suspects of date conversations. It was fantastic, one of the most engaging dates i have ever been on, and she was so,so, so very far out of my league in terms of looks.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1390335192.0,"Hey there fellow (step)mommy!  Greetings from another genetically impaired family unit! 

I'm in 150% the same boat.  We have custody of my stepson, he's mine in every way that matters.  We moved away from the town his mom and our families live in.  Constant back and forth with the grandparents about getting to see the kids, constant tug of war about time and junk with his mom.  So I'm totally with you on the rant, preach it sister!  But most of the stuff that is frustrating you is the kind of ongoing non-issues that you're going to have to live with I'm afraid.  Just a few thoughts about your circumstances:

1. Him seeing his mom in another town EVERY weekend plus half of school holidays is rather unusual.  This is something you should really speak to a lawyer about and be prepared to amend as he gets older.  Basically your current arrangement prevents him from developing social connections with his peers outside of school hours, which is not in his best interest.  His mom will not want to see her time with him change, but the pile of birthday parties he can't go to, clubs he can't join, and lack of close friends will add up as he moves through primary school.  I highly recommend that you talk to a lawyer and get some guidance on how and when you should be negotiating for a change or at least greater flexibility to accommodate his social and extracurricular activities.  

2. Power to grandma and grandpa.  If I had a nickle for everytime our parents complained about rarely seeing the kids, I could build a highspeed railway from their front door to ours!  Seriously, It's 2 hours in a car, you're retired, we have a spare room and you have an RV, just come visit the freaking kids.  But since that is apparently too much to expect, by all means, borrow my stepson from his mom whenever she'll let you.  That's her problem not mine.  I would be peeved about the Disneyland thing though, I want to share stuff like that with my kids!  Sure you can take him, but I wanna come too!  As far as putting in the effort to see them, don't break yourself over it.  No matter how hard you try it will never be enough, and you've got to make sure that you get quality time as a family unit so he feels like he belongs rather than just boarding with you for school.  Grandparents' privilege is to ignore all those realities and logistics. Plus, it's good for your stepson to have a support system in both places, splitting time between families is hard.

3. Our families made a better effort once we had other kids who rarely came to their town, plus we'll drop the kids on them for some ""us"" time every chance we get, and if you need to you can have your husband approach them about neglecting your new little bean, but don't look for an issue there unless it appears.  It's so not worth it.  That's the other nice thing about age gaps (I'm a huge fan of age gaps), the kids don't notice the different treatment nearly as much because you can attribute it more to age than situation.  It takes a little trial and error but you muddle through, and so do the grandparents.

So stay strong friend.  I've been in your shoes for almost 10 years and I can tell you, his mom will always be a pain in the ass and your inlaws will never see the kids as much as you or they want.  But it works out anyway, you just love them and then love them harder when they start in with ""I hate you"" and ""you're not my mom"".  It's worth it."

Zagaroth,askscience,1390335477.0,"This is one of those weird things because of light's wave/particle duality. 

By changing the wavelength of the wave, you chance the energy level of the particle (aka the photon). 

The packet of energy known as a photon is a discrete unit. it doesn't have an energy delivery period over time.

If a blue photon and a red photon both hit a (hypothetical, perfect, etc ) photovoltaic cell, the blue/higher frequency photon will generate more electricity than the red/low frequency photon will. 

All the energy is absorbed, it's a complete measurement of the energy of that photon (doesn't actually exist, but other experiments cover this well enough we can work with this simplified concept). low frequency photons have less energy than blue. It's what makes them red, but also making them redder reduces energy.

stretching it literally redefines it as something with less energy. And the difference of energy is simply gone. 

Note: If any one ever finds some sort of energy particle that the energy loss is converted into, it will probably completely revolutionize physics as we know it. But at this point, as far as we can tell, it's simply gone, and there is no observed phenomenon that could be accounted for as 'leaked photon energy from red shifting'"

Obviously if a brother and a sister are both carriers of some genetic thing it will be more likely to manifest in their offspring due to both parents being carriers, but that's true of any couple. And, anyway, lots of things are known to cause genetic defects, but we don't stop people with sickle cell anemia or with high likelihood of producing down syndrome kids from producing, or any other number of issues. They know the associated risks and they accept them.  So either you start policing those kind of cases too, or you stop policing them all.   Or at the very least say it's legal but require birth control.

The question of religious/moral beliefs is of course still a topic, but that's something I think would also be changed in a city where you could change everything from the ground up.  I wouldn't want a whole society of incest, to be clear. I just think that in the isolated cases where it happens, some de-stigmatization of it (especially in cases like [GSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_sexual_attraction) should not be as horrible as current society makes them out to be)."

If she won't step up, you and your husband need to. The trick will be to do it in a way that is not only includes her and your son but does it in a way that doesn't cause tension between the two families. 

Do you have monthly house meetings? If not, you should. Set aside some time during each month to talk to each other. Each meeting should be a safe place to talk about anything that's bothering any of you with the understanding that a resolution must come from the discussion. 

Your topic for the first meeting should be the kids and how they're getting along. Come prepared with several suggestions like a chore chart, complete with rewards. You need to assign separate chores to the boys so you can avoid one of the kids doing all the work. Draw up a list of house rules that you and Lucy agree on. All three of you need to present a united front when presenting them to the boys. 

These kids are basically siblings and the behavior they're displaying is akin to sibling rivalry. You and your husband need to understand where Lucy's boundaries are when it comes to you disciplining her child. Sitting down and talking about these things in a non-confrontational way will help with that. "

This one really is the cherry on top of the shit sundae-- I think I want to try my hand at it.

The people who behave like you do are either delusional self-pitying sociopathic Israeli Jews or pro-Israeli Jews-- you've already ruled this out, of course-- or people who somehow think that the Jews are magical and special and that their desires come before everyone else. You're sort of in that category, I think. Sort of.

Also include those people who support Israel primarily because they have a pathological hatred of any and all of the people from any Arab stock-- I think that's you, that's a pretty good description, at least in the partial sense.

Also include people who legitimately believe that ""Islam= Al Qaeda evil and theocratic tyranny"" and that anyone associated with or attached to any form or manifestation of Islam is evil Al Qaeda sub human vermin-- so that's also definitely you.
This subgroup of pro-Israel people often are completely ignorant about the non-Jews in the Middle East in general-- so that's you again.

Explanation: France under Nazi Germany's military occupation was one filled with a lack of rights and by every definition of the word: a police state. The German army seized all major supplies of food, fuel and liquor leading to ridiculously debilitating shortages throughout the country. All french citizens were banned from even visiting the entire Atlantic coastline of France. The fuel shortages led to desperate measures with people burning charcoal and other wooden materials for survival. The occupation also involved consistent aerial bombing raids from the Allies resulting in France being ""the second most severely bomb-devastated country on the Western Front of World War II.""

Things like The Child's Story Bible and D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths would be a solid start, and you could expand to Norse mythology, etc. This opens the door for discussions about morality and the similarities between the stories. If nothing else, a passing familiarity with these subjects is fantastic for general knowledge and all sorts of cultural references.

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1390336731.0,"Your mechanic is giving it to you straight. Listen to him. Lifting a vehicle affects it in a lot of ways that people don't think about at all, until the job is already done.

I can only speak as to transmission and drivetrain issues, since that's my professional field. Lifting the vehicle does change the angles of the drive train. There are ways to mitigate but it requires more work than just putting some springs on it. I'm not sure about it not moving forward but in reverse bit. If it breaks, it breaks. And you'll likely have no movement at all. Lifting the vehicle at extreme angles can put a lot of stress on the u joints. U joint failure can be catastrophic for the transmission and the car in general.

Steering and control I can't speak to specifically, but that just sounds like common sense due to high center of gravity.

Bigger tires will indeed result in loss of power and will kill your transmission. Basically because you have more tire surface area on the road. And more weight. It's going to bog down the vehicle. There are ways to also mitigate this, but it requires regearing the differential and putting more power to the engine.

You have to think about it. The vehicle comes already tuned to perform at it's best with the tires/wheels it has on it, at the vehicle height it already has. You take it out of those set parameters and you are taking the vehicle above and beyond it's intentions. It's at that point you have to address everything that the one thing you adjusted is going to affect.

So there's a few factors to consider, and once you look at what all has to be done, is it worth it? "

So first and foremost, make sure you know how to calculate TDEE and eat under that (-300 to -500kcal).  Make sure you get enough protein.  *Make sure you know how to document weight fluctuations.*  Weigh yourself first thing in the morning after you pee, record every day.  Average everything at end of week.  Compare 4+ averages to see true progress.  Weighing yourself in the middle of the day is useless, as you can easily go ±4 lbs in water/food/waste weight alone.

It's good you're implementing cardio, don't go crazy though.  Don't do over 4 hours/week.

Other than that, hit the weights.  Make sure you get every muscle with the big compound lifts.  If you feel lacking in a few areas you can devote some time to isolation exercises, try keep it to once a week though for isolating groups."

One campain has you playing as an older immigrant guy from Eastern Europe trying to get over the death of his wife as he tries to make it as a newspaper salesman.

I also found it very interesting when I read later that [supposedly one of the ""best"" endings you can get  is actually when rather than doing what the game tells you to do, you instead take your money and just buy a train ticket out of town rather than enduring the assholishness from your landlord](/spoiler)

I don't know how likely it is that people would have the exact same reaction I got/how likely it is that people would screw themselves in exactly the same way but I feel even without that the atmosphere, the music, the graphical style, the weird short surrealist dreams that the characters have at night, the way it uses the gameplay mechanics to transport the mood would probably still be plenty effective.

Honestly my razor doesn't dull quickly over here.

I do shave my lady garden area mainly because it keeps things, imho on my own body, cleaner. I prefer when men trim and shave down there too when it comes to sex. Swallowing a errant hair that lodges in my windpipe is just not sexy. I've been shaving that area for as long as I can remember and honestly it's bare even in those long months of no-sex singleness. I shave there pretty much each time I shower and it takes like 2 minutes total.

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1390337224.0,"You have several codes, and you may have a couple problems. I know what your main problem is, but not sure how that relates to the first two codes.

P0705 is Transmission Range Sensor Circuit Malfunction

Your transmission range sensor is a sensor/switch on your transmission that changes what gear the transmission is in as you physically move the shifter. It's not uncommon for these to go bad or become misaligned.

The transmission range sensor also double functions as a neutral safety switch. It prevents the car from being started in gear. So the problems you have when you come back to your car and are not able to start it, is probably your transmission range sensor acting up. It's probably shorted out or corroded. This also accounts for why your car will sometimes act up and go into a higher gear. Either because the transmission doesn't know what gear it's in, or it's going into what's called 'limp-home mode"" because the car computer sees a fault and puts it into limp mode to prevent further damage.

If your mechanic couldn't figure that out, he's an idiot. Go to another mechanic. Or a shop that works on transmissions specifically."

Basically, he goes to his school and makes friends, but he can't go to their birthday parties, or have playdates, or join many of the extracurricular activities, all of which would help him develop stronger relationships with his peers, because he spends every weekend out of town.

Think about what you did with your weekends when you were a kid, think about when you spent time with friends and when you did most of your bonding.  

I know he isn't splitting time between schools, he's just being prevented from having a typical social life outside of school because he spends all of his weekends away.  It becomes more pronounced and significant as they get older, but it can have negative affects on younger children too.  "

Pipstydoo,playrust,1390337642.0,"If your doors/valuables were gone, it means someone broke into your house.  Here's what you do:

- spawn.

- get your bearings.

- find the nearest boar/wood/metal and harvest it.  Craft a stone hatchet as soon as you can.  Throw away your rock.  Keep all cloth and animal fat.

- craft a sleeping bag, then craft a wooden shelter and a door.  Craft a small storage box.

- set up your house and then place your sleeping bag in it.  Put your storage box down.  Build a campfire.  When you die you'll return to that spot.

- now, hunt up as much wood/metal as you can.  Start crafting planks with the wood.  Start exploring a bit to find a little place tucked away from the road/your foraging area.

- turn your planks into one wood foundation, four wood pillars, three wood walls, one wood doorway.  Use wood to make another wood door.

- go to the tucked away place and build a 1x1 shelter. Move your sleeping bag there, or just craft another one and place it.  If you moved your sleeping bag, you'll have one spawn point.  If you crafted another one and placed it, you'll have two.  Put another storage box in it too.  If you have surplus cloth, craft it into cloth armor pieces.

- from here, the goal is to get a metal door.  You'll need a furnace for that.  You need stone, wood, and low grade fuel to craft a furnace.  You can craft low grade fuel from animal fat and cloth.

- install your furnace in your 1x1 and put all of your metal/sulfur into it.  Put some wood into it, and turn it on.

- once you have 200 metal fragments (easily done within a night cycle) craft your metal door.  You might need a workbench for this, but I don't remember if that's the case.  You'll need one anyway so you might as well craft it.

- now, you can do one of two things.  You can break down your wooden door and then wait for the leftover block to despawn, then place your metal door.  Or, you can build a 1x1 in front of your current door using the above method and place the metal door in *that* door frame.

And that's pretty much it.  This is your immediate goal anytime you join a new server, or if you get raided.  You will get raided, as you've already seen.  Metal doors don't stop that, but they do help you prevent anyone without grenades/C4 breaking into your house (which should be most people).

You could probably set this up within an hour or two if you stay on task.  If you see *anyone*, run away.  Don't risk your time on the off chance of a friendly.  Get stuff first, and get friends later."

Those people are definitely out there. 

But they're vastly in the minority, and that's my point. ""Faith"" broadly isn't the same thing as ""believing in the crazy shit in Revelation"", but the title makes it out to be. ""Faith"" includes everything all the way to just believing there's *some* metaphysical presence at work in the universe, or that put things into motion; or a belief in the existence of some sort of a ""soul"", or in any kind of existence after death. Those are things that we don't have any evidence of but also that we don't have any evidence *against* - and some (myself included) would argue that we probably *can't*. 

Hell, for that matter, I personally choose to believe in the existence of free will. Do you? *Even that* arguably constitutes ""faith"".

And the reason for the unorganized roadways isn't the lack of presence of cars since the city was established 1788 and Melbourne was 18...1835 if I recall correctly. So both were established before the Model T was widely available.

So what's the reason for Melbourne being like a perfect grid while Sydney is more unorganized than my shelf?

It's because of the locations and the land structure there. if you look at the map of Sydney's roads, you'll see that at one point, there is like a arc on the map and past that everything goes to hell. That arc is a ridge. Because its higher than the land below (duh) it obviously makes it harder to keep things organized. It was 1788 then and they obviously didn't give a fuck about traffic because there was none. They just wanted to get to where they wanted to get to so that's how you ended up with the ridiculous map.

But what about Melbourne? There was a lot of flat open land and that made the place easy to work with. And to add, since Melbourne was established 53 years later, it allowed the developers to actually look at Sydney's map and say ""nah bro. We ain't doin' that here."""

It seems to me like Spurs fans think they get so little attention around here, and that they're so underrated by the media. But then, of course, players like Tony Parker and Tim Duncan (not this year, but in the past) make the All-Star game purely because of reputation. 

So, if you look at the stats and then honestly believe that Parker is a top 3 PG whereas Dragic, Conley, Lawson and Isaiah Thomas can't even scratch the top 10, then I have to ask how much longer you guys are going to play the ""underrated and unappreciated"" card. "

When you feel like you might get over the edge you can also try squeezing your PC muscle, which is the same muscle you use while peeing to get the last of the pee out. If squeezing the muscle isn't enough, you should also combine it with deep breaths and/or stop moving for like 5 seconds.

Futurecat3001,DebateAnAtheist,1390339435.0,"1.  Science isn't a belief set.  It's a system of verifying claims with evidence.  Since God isn't verifiable with scientific tools, the current theory is that God doesn't exist.  That could change if we are ever presented with evidence more concrete than ""I think he does""  ""I want him to""  ""I just *know* he's there"", etc. 

2. OK, lets play along here for a minute.  Who designed God?  Then, who designed God's designer?  Then, who designed God's designer's designer?  Repeat to infinity.  You're begging the question by stipulating a designer because of the existence of a thing.  Don't do that.  That a thing exists is not evidence that there exists some conscious entity that designed that thing (because if that were sufficient evidence, you would immediately get the infinite regress of God's designer's designer I mentioned above).  Instead, start with: ""what evidence is there for this thing?"" and go from there.  You'll quickly see that there is no evidence for God and so, to the best of our current knowledge, we can claim God doesn't exist.

If you disagree, I welcome you to make an argument for God's existence that cannot also be used to prove every other imaginable deity that has ever or could ever be conceived by human beings."

WormTickle,AdviceAnimals,1390339582.0,"Yes, thank you so much for checking on me. It's very kind of you.

I'm happily married (five years this March!) with a three year old daughter and a son on the way. I don't work right now (medically separated from the US Navy last year), but I've got plenty of food in the fridge and a warm home full of fun and happiness. 

As a military spouse, I've finally got access to the mental health care I've needed for so very long, and I'm in a great place. I'm recovering from my problems without medication, and had no idea just how much help I needed until I started getting it.

I haven't spoken to my mom much at all. She knows I'm pregnant and knows it's a boy, but that's about it. I can't let her trigger more anxiety attacks, so I just don't speak to her. I will email her photos of my daughter and not reply to any responses. That has to be enough for her, because I will not listen to anymore. She is a bitter, angry woman and thinks that it is appropriate to use me as her drunken rant sound off board, and I won't allow it anymore. She has warped our relationship into something that makes her more of the child, and it's not healthy for me to have to take care of her.

Luckily, I live on the other side of the country and the US is a pretty damn big country, so there is no random popping in on me (knock on wood) like she used to do when I lived closer to home."

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskWomen,1390339749.0,"Sex isn't something that you give away. It's not like you have a finite number of sex units, and every time you have sex you give that person one unit of your sex that you can never get back, and if you do that too many times you have no more sex to give and you're all used up. 

It's true that your body releases bonding hormones. This is why a lot of people find that being ""friends with benefits"" doesn't work well for them - they invariably wind up with feelings for the person and then it cannot remain so casual. But if a relationship breaks up after a few years, people are still able to move on. Sometimes it's easier than other times, but people do it. Humans are resilient and we heal as time goes by.

Don't be afraid of sex. You won't destroy yourself if you break that bond - truth be told, those feelings are caused just as much by spending time with that person as they are by having sex with them. My bond with my husband was already deep and wide and strong, long before we ever had sex. Why? Because we had forged a relationship."

So, I'd ideally want a God that couldn't be disproved and had an essentially mysterious nature.  I'd want my God to be able to take credit for everything good in peoples' lives (to help motivate them to pay me money and continue to respect my place in the political circles of the community), but it would be equally important that anything bad would be construed as simply part of God's mystery, or perhaps an appropriately vague warning against some proscribed set of behaviors.

Basically I'd design the Christian God, or maybe the Islamic one depending on how much I value personal enrichment vs political power.  The more freedom offered to society the faster it could grow economically, so if I like money I would design something like the Christian God.  If I wanted more control I'd go for Islam and really emphasize the idea of ""making war on infidels"" to help bind my people together under my authority, by giving them a common enemy and a persecution complex."

superspeck,HomeImprovement,1390340301.0,"It's a pretty big red flag. 

Right now, that townhouse is a firetrap just with what you've seen in the panel. 

Every time I, as a DIY renovator, have seen a panel that's as thoroughly F'd up as the one in the townhouse you're looking at, there has been much scarier things in the walls and attic, because that's where most of the changes get made and then covered up. Yes, $5,000 will get you a new panel and service. But it's not going to fix the problems that WILL be throughout the rest of the structure. 

I was working on a friend's house and found a bad splice that was actually a very slow-burning fire. Went to trace the wire back. Realized that all 22 outlets/fixtures in the living room, master bed, master bath, his little girl's room, and family room were on one 15A circuit, and that circuit had several junctions hidden that I'd found. I shut off power to it. Between electricians, a secondary panel, several thousand feet of wire, and pulling down big chunks of drywall in five rooms, it was a $10,000 fix. And his house was built in 1996 and he was the second owner, so it's not like he was dealing with a lot of work done by successive generations of cheap owners, landlords, and contractors. 

Frankly, if you pass on the property based on the advice that you get here (which I would strongly advise unless you really intend to open the walls and replace most of the wiring), I would pass your inspection report on to the fire marshall and building department. I don't like peeing in another person's cheerios (bad karma), but this is a connected structure and is putting other families at serious risk without their knowledge or consent and I couldn't live with myself if some kid died because of a problem I knew about and didn't tell anyone else about.

You mean proving my point?  Apple is more expensive than anything else.  That is a fact.

&gt;What is a ""true"" retina display then?

A true retina display would be closer to 400+ dpi apples is around 30% of the way there.

&gt;Also, the entire internet disagrees with you on whether or not it is amazing.

That's nice.  BTW the entire internet does not agree on anything let alone on apples ""retina"" display.  Also many people hate the ""retina"" display as the prefer non glossy screens.  Also it would be nice if everything in the world was designed for the current high resolution screens however they are not.  BTW apples retina display is not that much better than other high resolution screens.

&gt;As far as trackpads go, it is by far the best. If you don't like trackpads then that is your opinion.

They are not the best trackpads though.  Every buttonless trackpad is a failure in my opinion.  If you like it that is your opinion and therefore can not be the best.

&gt;You must not program, do webdev, or anything related to multimedia. If you don't like it though, then you are entitled to your opinion. Surely you must see that many, many people disagree though.

I am a webdev and do program.  I also make 3d animated short films in my spare time(which I do not have much of lately).  Apple is simply the worst environment to work in for any of those fields.  At one time they had an advantage.  That advantage is long, long gone.

It's perfectly possible to criticize takfirism or jihadism or Salafi-inspired conservative Islamism in Europe-- the problem isn't at all ""too little people are criticizing it"".

I mean, the ""counter jihadist"" (who all love Israelis, by the way) movement's big ideological thing is based around massive deportations of anyone who comes from any sort of ""Muslim"" background, as well as deportation of ultimately anyone who isn't Western European.

I get that you don't see ethnic cleansing as a big deal, but openly racist, deluded enthnocidal freaks aren't the ""solution"" to dealing with instances of radicalism in Europe. "

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390340947.0,"It's quite common in other countries for taxes to be included.  

But the US being a collection of 50 or more tax  jurisdictions (local governments and territories as well...) with a lot of big companies with  lobbying power means it's unlikely to happen.

Lets say you're making a thing - doesn't matter what the thing is, it's a thing and it costs money.  If you run a nationwide ad for that thing, and print promo materials for that thing, then every person has to figure out the price in their own tax area.  But it's cheaper to make one set of ads everywhere than separate ads for 50 separate places.  If you're a company trying to sell in the US you want to lobby politicians to keep your costs down.  A 400 dollar thing is 400 dollars everywhere, and you figure out your own tax.

If the US could have a single federal sales tax rate, then you might see a shift to move prices to the local value, or it could be legislated by law.  But Walmart, the car companies, electronics companies etc.  all want to make one set of adverts for the US (notable TV ads).  

In Europe, since you need to do stuff in  different languages anyway it's not as much of a cost, and there are a lot more companies squabbling with each  other, so while prices might be fixed in say the UK or France, they need not match each other, and you need to produce separate ads anyway.

GhostsofDogma,changemyview,1390341067.0,"I'm not an expert in these things so I can't give you academic descriptions as to why it happens, but I'd like to back up what some people are saying here with some personal experience.

There's something about face-to-face communication that has a different effect than digital; not something that is overall ""better"" or anything, but different- and things that are different are better or worse at particular things.

My particular example concerns therapy and anxiety relief. I find that, even though I lack social skills, am extremely introverted, and process information a bit slower in a way that makes face-to-face conversation hard, and think I communicate far better online, speaking to someone in person is infinitely better in terms of anxiety relief. Having a living, breathing human being in front of you has a very strong emotional edge to it that connects to you in a way that's highly beneficial for neurotic issues. 


I've found that the thoughts whirring around in your head become very stagnant if you don't unload to someone face to face once in a while, even if you make a habit of speaking to people online. I suspect that the two different modes of communication use slightly different parts of the brain... I do remember something my psychologist said a long time ago about how you think differently when you are using the computer for long periods of time versus physically interacting with others, but I forget what it was. (She has nothing against doing the former, by the way.)

Aside from those things, there's a wealth of human methods of communication that you simply aren't exposed to online. Tone, body language, inflection, and et cetera. These are important parts of the human condition and while online communication has other benefits, they aren't the same ones. One must take a balanced approach to life, and taking in the benefits of each is important. I'd say that someone who's never read a book in their life is just as impaired as what these people claim someone who spends their entire life on the computer and speaks to their friends almost entirely through texts from day one would be. It's actually a bit hilarious how old folks are always talking about how we should 'send people letters' but decrying emails and social media- there's really very little difference if you actually think about it.



Do I think lots of those old people you're talking about are full of alarmist garbage? Yeah. But you always have to be careful of pushing back too hard, too."

ajdeemo,DotA2,1390341443.0,"it's virtually impossible for a game like dota to be completely balanced. if one hero is even very slightly better than the rest, the professionals will abuse that.

you also have to consider what situations each hero excels at. undoubtedly, some heroes will be better in some situations than others.   it's impossible to balance each hero to be equally balanced in every situation. furthermore, that would also be boring.

the best balance we can hope for is a metagame of variety. this means that we will have a broad range of common picks, both heroes that are good in many situations (flexible), and heroes that fit best into certain strategies, but work very well in them (such as how pugna has been picked as of late). some heroes will be very situational and possibly never mainstream. but remember, even if they do become a common pick, they're probably taking another hero's place.

my vision of a ""perfect"" balance of dota (or at least as close as we can get) is a metagame where if someone picks an unorthodox hero, such as bloodseeker, tusk, or zeus, few ask why because they understand the type of draft that hero goes into. that hero may be picked very very rarely, but he works extremely well in the correct draft.

even this may not be achieveable in a game with the high amount of characters like dota. it may simply be that the metagame can only handle 60-80 heroes, and others will be left in the dust."

&gt; Easier repair and replacement

I have never needed repairs or replacement on any of my laptops barring one Toshiba and macbook pro.  Their chargers are horrible.

&gt;Excellent free or almost free in-house apps.

Sorry I do not need apps.

&gt;I help a lot of older people with their technology. My Mom, mother-in-law, father-in-law, a bunch of random friends/acquaintances from work, and even my 95 year old grandfather! I can tell you from experience that it's about infinity times easier teaching someone to use an iPad or MadBook than it is teaching them to use an Android, or /shudder a Windows PC.

Really because honestly windows is the easiest thing to teach people to use.  It is much more intuitive than mac.  Well before windows 8.


&gt;Well, you see, my work laptop and I have been married for years. I'm a computer science teacher by day

A computer science teacher that uses mac.  Now I have heard everything.  But I guess it is one of those you cant do you teach type situations.  Had 1 professor that was a mac fan but she was my web design prof.

&gt;I have no particular budget, as I'm fortunate enough to be able to spend whatever I feel like on a laptop.

Then why not buy a much better laptop for around the same price?  Also one that would work much better for your job as a comp sci teacher.  You know one that makes sense in your field a little more.

&gt;For my purposes, in 2012, there was no better laptop than the 15"" MacBook Pro retina for my purposes - as a combination of weight (4.6 lbs) and power (Quad i7 2.6 GHz/3.6 GHz) with a 7 hour battery and a 2880x1800 display. For $2500ish I'm having my cake and eating it, too. It's powerful and ridiculously portable, with a screen that is still amongst the best on the market.

Except that is simply not true.  Everything you said is a complete lie.  Unless your purposes is to look at it and have a mac.
Also the screen is not amongst the best that is more advertisement crap from apple.

&gt;iOS is easy to use, presents a consistent and easy-to-master user experience

No, no it doesn't.  But that's what their advertising has been drilling.  It is actually very anti user friendly.

&gt;You are the biased one and you have a venemous hate for a brand.

I do and I do.  I will not deny that.  I never have.

&gt;Think about that for a minute.

You should think about your ignorance and lies.

&gt;You're so feeble that you go out of your way to hate on a brand. Don't feel bad. It's a social phenomenon and it's because we are so comfortable as a species that we make up superfluous non-sense to aim our raw emotions at.

LMAO.  You are an idiot who worships a subpar product that is not efficient for your field of work you claim to be in.  You make false claims and then insist you are not biased because you have a gaming rig.  Well I have multiple macbooks.  And they are shit compare to my old ass 400 dollar asus laptop at being a laptop.

You are a pathetic individual and I pity any students you have as you probably insist that mac is the best device to use if you are actually a teacher which I highly doubt.  No self respecting comp sci teacher outside of middle/highschool would ever use a mac."

I don't really remember anything before kindergarden and those memories are vague. I knew that I was different when I was five or six, I thought I was worse than everybody else when I was six or seven, that stopped when my parents told me and my grades/behavior in school really changed then. I could read in kindergarden but I didn't really know I was reading, it wasn't until I got my self confidence back that I could consciously read things. It's weird, I know. You will probably want to tell him when he's young and stress that he isn't any better or worse than anybody else, just different. You may want to look for somebody in the spectrum to act as a mentor of sorts but that'll be tough, if we learn to pass then we don't really advertise being autistic due to all the stigma.

Autism is a label but it's more than that. It isn't something that can change, it isn't something you should want to change, it's part of him. Because of his genes his brain is wired differently, the differences are subtle but the brain is so sensitive that minor differences have drastic results and this is major. You need to accept him for who he is and make sure that he accepts himself, the difficulty will be in doing that while making him understand that others will not be so accepting so he should avoid telling people unless he trusts them completely.

Make sure that he knows that if he has a problem with something he can tell you and you'll try to do something about it, our senses tend to be a little different so we'll sense things that you can't and feel differently about different things. Common things that we dislike are fluorescent lights (attempts to increase efficiency have mostly dealt with this), fans (or anything else that spins at high speeds), and various types of materials and foods. If he seems to dislike certain types of clothing then find ways to get around it, if he doesn't like some foods then don't force him to eat them. You can try to find patterns in the foods he likes and dislikes to help him try more things but don't count on them appearing or being consistent. Under no condition should you force him to eat something he doesn't like especially by hiding it in other foods, it could make him stop trusting food and that means he may stop eating or will eat a very restricted diet. He will respond to things differently, it's the way he's wired. He may say things that make no sense or are rude, they are totally fine to him. He will express his emotions differently than you do, try to learn how to read him so he has somewhere to be himself and still be understood. Try to learn how he thinks so that he doesn't need to translate things to make you understand. Try to help him learn how to act so that others won't think he's different, I mostly figured it out by the time I was eight and I had no help (I did have plenty of incentive, or at least I thought I did).


The most important thing for you to remember is to stay away from anybody who talks positively about a ""cure"" (look up ""Don't Mourn for Us"") and under no condition put him in anything at all related to ABA or try to teach him to make eye contact or get rid of his stims. ABA is done one of two ways, it's either just abuse or it's a glorified and absurdly expensive day care that kind of treats kids like dogs. For many of us eye contact is very uncomfortable, I used to be able to make eye contact for about thirty seconds within ten minutes before I would start to feel physical pain (it was uncomfortable but I could do it if I had to) then things happened and my brain skips straight to pain. Our stims are complex, if your son is physically harming himself (bruising or drawing blood) then you need to try to replace the stim but otherwise you should just try to help him control himself so he can choose to stim or not to stim (it's kind of like being able to shut off part of your expression of emotions). Getting rid of his stims would mostly mean getting rid of his methods to deal with stress, that should never be a goal. You may actually find it interesting that some have connected attempts to make us ""normal"" with drastically lowered quality of life."

Her best chance is to come to the U.S. on a student F1 Visa and do one of those certificate programs or a Masters program. During this time, she'll have a chance to network and she'll have a better chance at finding a job with her being here in the States. 

Once she is done with her education, she'll she can go for OPT. She'll have to choose her company carefully because the F1 visa only permits OPT for a year, and if she wants to stay longer than that, she'll need a company willing to sponsor her for the H1B visa.

Getting the H1B, depending on the year, can be kind of a crapshoot, but if she really wants to work here long term, this is probably her best bet barring marriage.

Fact is U.S. workers are the most productive in the world and since '79 productivity has risen well over 50% but real earnings have actually declined in that time - after WWII when the middle class was formed and grew there was a close link between productivity gains and wage gains - a sense of shared reward, that hard work was rewarded ""A hard day's work for a fair day's wage"" ... all that was broken when the globalists, free-traders, central bankers, et al destroyed U.S. manufacturing, shipped jobs overseas, part-timed workers, downsized them, etc. etc. ... the bottom 80% have had negative earnings (or nearly flat) since '79 whereas the top 20% earned about 8% more, the top 1% earned 400% more and the top .01% earned trillion$ more

old people used to eat cat foot and live in hovels or on the street, then we created Social Security to give them dignity, and Medicare so they could be cared for, and today those over 65 years old have a net worth 46 times that of households headed by those 35 and younger ( http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/income/story/2011-11-06/wealth-gap-young-old/51098910/1 )... most households younger than 65 have two or more wage-earners and pay a vastly higher percentage for housings costs and healthcare and education than those over 65 did

the latter WWII generation and the Boomers got all the advantages while Gen-X, Gen-Y and now Millennials got the shaft, the shift of wealth to the top and smug and condescending attitudes from their elders who let the corporate/internationalist robbery take place

and how did the oldsters get so financially secure? ... did they really work harder and have better attitudes? ... or was it the GI Bill that paid for college, and free community colleges, and affordable housing as new neighborhoods sprung up all over along with the interstate system, or cheap health care under the non-profit Blue system, and a single job that a man could work and pay for his house/car/food/clothes/medical/vacations/all of it and still have cash left over to put in a bank as savings???

It's certainly more of a violation than, say, keeping somebody's underwear after you sleep with them, which is caddish but dramatically less invasive.

When he accidentally tracked the girls' cycles, it's kind of gross and personal, but doing it by accident can be roughly excused as the result of the character's underdeveloped sense of what's socially acceptable and tendency to commit to things.

It's not theoretically impossible for somebody to be sufficiently detached from reality and from normal social mores that they think that somehow installing electronic devices on their friends is okay, but such a person is *dangerous* and needs help.

They're bringing back Brie Larson this year. Brie Larson previously played Abed's love interest. Are we supposed to buy that somebody who implants electronics in his friends without their consent is a safe person to be in a romantic relationship with? Even within the show's bent reality and the relative laxness with which it treats Abed's decisions, some things feel like they go a bit far.

That's kinda why I said to agree to disagree, because I had a feeling you felt that way. I specifically tried to avoid using the gender argument because I ABSOLUTELY think that Team Ninja tried to make Samus appear weak, and I think that their attempt in doing so is what caused such a catastrophe. For fuck sakes, other than Ninja Gaiden, Team Ninja is best known for making *Dead or Alive*, one of the most blatantly sexualized series in gaming. They add tits and ass to absolutely everything they make, and reduce females to objects of desire, with no characterization other than hoping the male pays attention to them. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing; it's just the material that they make satisfies that sort of idea of a 'male power fantasy.' But Samus didn't become a popular female character through sex appeal; she got there through being a sheer badass...Then Team Ninja came along and fucked it up. While they showed a lot of restraint in making Samus sexy, she still has a lot more sex appeal than necessary, and lacks any character other than ""I hope Adam-san notices me~~""

Furthermore, the 'father figure' argument isn't applicable here, even though I recall Samus saying that, too. The problem is that Adam acts like an abusive father figure. Going back to the Pyrosphere example, Samus doesn't activate her Varia suit until Adam tells her to, despite the fact *her life is in danger.*  It makes Samus seem like she has Stockholm Syndrome; despite her need to have the Varia suit, she would rather follow orders and risk her life rather than risk provoking Adam."

Edit: Some points in the article worth noting that aren't really getting a lot of traction in subreddit discussion surrounding this.

* Mourinho would still be given the final say as to whether Mata should be released.

* The Portuguese could yet block any move, though his stance is likely to be shaped by **Mata's attitude**

Mata's attitude is an important point. He's still got love for the club and our players, read his blog on weekends.  Minutes on the pitch aside he hasn't been a bitch about this, it sounds like he's taking it in stride for the most part.

* [Mata] would not naturally agitate for a transfer but, if he makes clear his desire to move in talks with the management, the club are expected to yield.

Again, it seems like management wants Mata to make the move even if United make a bid.

* Wayne Rooney, a player Chelsea have coveted since last summer, will not move to Stamford Bridge as part of any prospective deal for Mata. 

So cash only, and we lose some cover in the midfield because of moving Mata out. It seems like the club would either want Cash + Rooney, or force United to break the bank. That is if Mourinho says okay, and Mata makes it clear he wants to leave.

And again...

* Mourinho would still be given the final say as to whether Mata should be released.

People on here are lamenting as if we've already lost him, people on the MUFC subreddit are talking about this like Mata's already in a red tracksuit. In the event he does leave, we're going to make a shit ton of money and make Moyes put Juan Mata on the Glazer's charge card or (on an off chance) bring in another striker with some money as well. "

Let's just think of a obssessed character we all know: Batman. Batman believes in two things: One, that he must fight crime, two, that the way it must be done is by not killing anyone.

Like Batman, you believe in two things: One, that you must fight heightism, two, that the only way to do it is by showing that it exists and there is no other way around.

Both you and batman are unbreakable, unchanchable and unmutable. You have an ideia in your head and you devote a great part of your life to it, without even questioning it or taking a break for a reality check. You have a strong presence in this forum, you have blogs, you even have lame youtube videos man... Sometimes the way you talk about heightism makes you sound like a modern feminist.

There is no way of making you think that maybe exposing heightism (I've always wondered if you were the one who made that blog) isn't really the way to end it.  And the worst part is that you're an inteligent guy. I can imagine a kid reading around the web something like ""short guys suck"" and just roll his eyes and go about his day. But that same kid may find your work or maybe something like that twitter exposing heightism (something that I even don't like to talk because I don't want people googling that), and it may place in him insecurities about his height that will last years. I don't know what will end heightism, but exposing it will do more harm than good. Here in Portugal there is a saying that goes ""quanto mais mexes na merda mais ela cheira mal"", wich means, ""the more you mess around shit, the worst it will smell"". 

The worst way heightism can affect somebody it's by believing it will.

Answering your question, what is there to talk about height if not heightism? Half of it. Heightism is the negative side of the coin, and there will always be positive things that should receive the same atention. "

Overclocking isn't nearly as difficult as it is made out to be. For the most part you're just changing 2 settings in your BIOS, that's the multiplier (this will correspond to your clock rate) and your voltage.  Just boost the multiplier a bit, run Prime95 to stress test your newly overclocked CPU, if it gives trouble, either down clock or up the voltage a teeny bit (normally in increments of 0.05). There's always a touch more than that of course, look up other people's overclocks on your motherboard and see learn from example. I'm sure you could get that i7 up to 4.5 with ease"

For me, it becomes the idea that someone can come up with an idea but then use subsidized labor to accomplish it, just as Walmart uses today with it's employee reliance on public assistance programs.  The profits head toward executives and share holders, while the programs are not refilled.  Basically, it's spreading the costs of a business to the tax payers instead of the capital class of owners/shareholders.  If you start a business then you deserve the profits because you are taking the risk. If everyone around you is assuming the risk then you don't deserve the profits only a wage.

It comes down to what type of economy you are looking for. Fascism tends to the privatizing profits and socializing losses while socialism tends toward socializing both profits and loss. These are contrary to the idea of the ""Free Market""/Capitalism which privatizes both profits and losses.  Of course nothing is pure so it's a sliding scale in reality, but these are your control points.

So what is getting women to message him now rather than before? Obviously the way he answered the questions, but why? I'm still not sure how this is happening. I mean the biggest hurdle every guy has in online dating is getting responses to messages let alone messages out of the blue sent to them.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1390345431.0,"Lack of intimacy is a really difficult issue that all married couples deal with (I'm pulling ""all"" out of my butt, but I'm pretty sure it's accurate) at some point or another.

The awesome news, as others have pointed out, is that this matters to him and he's dedicated to fixing it.  His initiative in starting therapy is huge, HUGE and probably the best sign there is.

The bad news is that you're pregnant right now, and that is going to make this issue harder to fix.

But you CAN fix it.  Maybe right now that means working with a therapist slowly, coming to an understanding of your present limits and setting goals for the future, and negotiating what you CAN do to improve right now.

It's ok to feel hurt.  But it is NOT ok to give up your dreams of a family with your best friend.  Marriage is for better or worse, in good times and in bad.  Hitting one of those bad times does NOT mean your marriage has failed.  It's part of life.  When you come out the other side you will be stronger for it, you and your best friend will have a stronger family for it, and your child will have a better model of healthy relationships from it.

So take time to feel hurt, recognize that your feelings are valid, but never let yourself forget that you CAN fix things and that you're going to, because he's worth it."

As for being loud, well, I know a few meek Americans, but I can be loud. I try to be more conscientious abroad than I am at home about my volume, and I've never garnered strange looks or anything. We tend to get most loud when we're in groups of other Americans, so tour groups are always the most irritating (not to mention embarrassing when I've encountered them abroad).

lost2darkness,AskWomen,1390345532.0,"Late to the thread but given my experiences I thought I should post. 

I've been in open relationships since I was 18 - my first big relationship was as a third for a couple. It had some very positive moments but there were times I felt like I was the add-on and used for fun, not a core part of things. That relationship fell apart due to failures in communication, and even if is been one on one it likely wouldn't have worked out for this reason. 

With my current SO we have had a handful of threesomes, mostly with other women. My boyfriend and I are both bi so it has made things easier in that regard. I've always been the one to instigate, usually bringing in female friends or partners, and my SO is happy to play along. Usually we negotiate with partners ad nauseum, and often the talking goes longer than the actual sex. Setting what expectations are and what the limits are for all parties is essential to help prevent people from having hurt feelings. 

Poly in general has made me happier and my relationships stronger. I feel like I have more support from various partners and get all of my needs met without leaning to heavily on my SO. We both know who each other sleeps with and general idea of what we do. It keeps it open and honest and has been fantastic so far. "

Not all debt is bad debt. Don't view it as so. And if you grew up poor, then where you are at the moment is pretty comfy.

If I may do so, I'd hazard a guess that what's *actually* happening now is that you're coming to terms with settling down. You know, when you ask kids about their future, they talk about what they'll do for a living, who their significant partner will be, where they'll live, and what they'll name their kids. You've just done all the above. In some strange way, all of your childhood and education has culminated together and you're finally in a somewhat sound position. What now? It's just a monotonous drone, more of the same until you retire. *Or so your mind tells you.*

Sure, you're still putting yourself through more education and there's more progress to go. All of this means that you're pretty much safe now, and it's just a matter of climbing your way up the property ladder and a chain of hopeful promotions until you can get really cozy in your middle age.

Willravel,startrek,1390345712.0,"There are several in-universe possibilities:

1) Kirk's brazen nature. One thing we've seen a lot of is that there's a tendency to allow starship captains in Starfleet to really set their own rules when it comes to certain things. Sometimes the Captain is able to take the ship for a few days between missions to help a crewman with personal problems, even. Kirk's not a bridge-dweller by nature, he likes to engage with his missions and to be in the thick of it. He'd be miserable being forever trapped on the bridge, and he is also a highly capable away officer (which might be the excuse Kirk uses for others and even himself). He goes down with his best friends to make contact or solve the mystery or beat the bad guys. It's why he's in Starfleet. 

2) Kirk's experiences are highly atypical. Remember that the Enterprise is on a special 5 year mission of exploration, unlike most Starfleet vessels which are doing scientific research or are engaged in humanitarian aid. General Starfleet rules for the captain to stay on the bridge during away missions would make no sense for the commander of a small science vessel exploring the fauna of a new type M planet or a captain escorting diplomats engaged in trade negotiations or a captain of a ship that's assisting a less technologically advanced culture put in place a seismic control system. The dangerous Enterprise missions are so rare that the normal rules seem a bit lax. 

3) Starfleet Command is trying to get Kirk killed. As much as you or I might enjoy Kirk's bold command style and assertive nature, he's probably often a nightmare for his superiors to deal with. This is not to say he wasn't a terrific officer and one of the greatest heroes of his generation, but can you imagine having to deal with Kirk when he gets a bug up his skant about something and you disagree with him? Good luck. "

Not paying attention to make sure the gasket/o-ring from the old oil filter comes off the block, then putting the new oil filter on with two gaskets on which causes a leak. Then not noticing it until all the oil has leaked out and the engine start making noise from lack of lubrication.

&gt; found a video that shows how the oil filter can be removed by just turning the wheel hard right.

I don't know about all that. It depends on how low your car sits and how small you are, how long your arms are, to be able to reach under there. You really need to be able to safely get under your car to reach the filter, get enough leverage on it to loosen it &amp; tighten it back up. Same for your drain plug."

This indicates that there are likely a lot of behaviors that would result in a diagnosis of psychopathy and/or personality disorders. Is he completely devoid of empathy? We don't know. But is it probable, based on the actions that show very little empathy, that he has at best, very low ability for empathy? Yes.

&gt;FAQ: What is “internalized sexism”?


&gt;Short definition: Internalized sexism is the **involuntary**(my bold) internalization by women of the sexist messages that are present in their societies and culture.

http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/10/20/internalized-sexism/

Feminists cannot comprehend why any woman would be comfortable in her gender role, so they declare them all insane and alienated acting against their needs.

Why is it called internalized? Can men be internalized sexists too?

I'm afraid not, young padawan. You see, men externalize sexism. They are the source. Women can at worst be brainswashed parrots for men's evil, sexist beliefs."

I am treated as a temptress before I even do anything. I'm basically celibate/perma-single and that makes it worse, not better (ie, I am not flirting with anyone, so it's assumed I am flirting with everyone, or something). so I've taken to avoiding interacting with men who are in relationships, stopped wearing makeup and wear unflattering clothes. It's depressing as shit, and I just want to feel normal again. But I can't stand the way women treat me.

It would be an oversimplification to say the universe is simply cooling as it expands, equally distributing a finite amount of energy as it does. But in a layman's way as my high school professor put it, that's an easy way to put it. Entropy, distribution and an eventual equilibrium is a theory that would explain that the universe is a closed system and that there's a definite amount of energy intrinsically and what observable consequences should occur, such as an eventual equilibrium. Again gravitational bodies can increase their energy while at the same time becoming cooler, so this law doesn't explain everything. Rarely does any one law do that.

Personally, I'm not certain I fully agree with the closed system or at least the implications suggested by that. Nor am I happy with this oversimplified view of things. I wasn't happy with it in high school and no one has answered questions I had in high school since regarding some of my observations and doubts. Stepping back and looking at all the laws together, there are questions raised. My high school professor couldn't answer them and so, he went to one of his college professor's who was equally stumped. I'm still stumped also. That's another topic though."

nesfor,Drugs,1390346879.0,"What else is life about if not to make mistakes and then not make them again?

It was a dangerous thing to do, and I'm sure you knew that. Sometimes we just have to learn the hard way. I know that feeling -- I've never had to go to the hospital, but I've thought I was invincible and mixed things that shouldn't be mixed, assuming I'd be okay. Afterward, once I could think again, it was that overwhelming shame and self-loathing that you're feeling now. Why didn't I listen? What could possibly have justified my behavior? I couldn't face myself.

My best advice is to admit your mistake, take responsibility, and then forgive yourself. You can't let yourself dwell. Let it change your perspective on yourself and on drugs, and then continue onward, perhaps for cautiously than before. We fuck up sometimes. And it's okay. You have another chance, as many as you need to get it right."

When suddenly half the jobs disappear that is an increase in unemployment we can't cover with our current system.

While these changes may lead to a net increase in efficiency and thus profits, this effect is only noticed by those at the top, who earn more. But without changes in the system, those whose jobs are replaced will all go down in income. If taxes aren't increased, the social system will go bankrupt and even more people will be unable to actually survive. We need to model a society that covers for this, based on the fact that the workforce is no longer scarce but abundant.

They made the incision between my ribs and proceeded to shove a tube the size of my thumb between my ribs and into my lung. There was screaming and tears.

I will never forget that pain."

Penultimatum,IAmA,1390347863.0,"Depends on context. ""At its finest"" can be a modifier to both ""Austrian food"" and ""comfort food,"" so you should, at least in part, use context to determine the meaning. Because of the ambiguity, a sentence such as, ""Austrian food is comfort food at its finest"" generally uses the modifier at the end to modify the object, not the subject.

However, ""at its best health"" can only modify ""the bird,"" not ""10km/hr."" As such, both sentences your example use have the same meaning.

If you instead said, ""The peregrine falcon can fly faster than a golden eagle at its best health,"" it would be ambiguous. Context is not present in this case. You should then assume that ""at its best health"" modifies the object (in this case, ""golden eagle"").

If you wished to remove all ambiguity, you should say, ""The peregrine falcon, at its best health, can fly faster than a golden eagle,"" or, ""The peregrine falcon can fly faster than the healthiest of golden eagles."" Each of those two sentences has only one possible meaning, if I'm not mistaken."

now is the issue not enough real fans can get tickets? That is potentially a problem.

The way I would do it is 3^(k) &gt; 2^(k) &gt;= 2k (this second part is a well known result that's often proven as an example). If it wasn't shown as an example or something, then it's really simple to prove that one (2^(k) &gt;= 2k), and you can do it in a line or two. Then note that 3^(k) &gt; 1

So 3^(k) + 3^(k) &gt; 2k + 1

I'd be careful with saying 3^(k) &gt; 2k + 1, since it's not true for k = 1. You could argue you've already shown the increment 1 → 2 in your base case, and that k &gt; 1 in your induction step. But you'd need to explicitly say that, and I feel that's a bit messy.

Well yeah, any decision as to what the worst KyoAni show is would be relative, since you are comparing it to other KyoAni shows.

Anyways, whilst I wasn't a huge fan of Kyoukai no Kanata, you'd have trouble convincing me that it is worse than their key visual novel adaptations (which are basically all the same stories with different characters) of a while back. I'd take KnK over something like Clannad any day.

&gt; I'd much rather have them trying new things like they did with Free!

What makes Free! more ""new"" than KnK? Neither were sequels. Both are based on light novels that KyoAni publishes.

kornberg,TwoXChromosomes,1390348345.0,"Ask her what she wants and let her have it--if she wants to be alone, fine. If she wants to go see a movie or get awful food or just sit on the couch and watch Netflix--do it. When someone close to me experiences a loss, I ask ""I can't imagine how you feel right now--do you want to talk, do you want me to distract you or do you want me to leave you alone for a bit?"" Usually they are pretty honest with their choice. Then I drop off something. It can be something like having a pizza delivered or making a meal and leaving it there or it could be something like making a care package of things that they may appreciate. For your sister--maybe a basket of things that she would enjoy for relaxation--bubble bath or bath bomb, fancy candles, nail polish, a good book (without pregnant ladies or kids), a video game or whatever you think would be something she would use to recharge herself. 

Grief can be incredibly isolating so keep reaching out, even if she keeps rebuffing you. People are going to back off in about 3 days and since they are ok, they are going to forget that she's not ok. Keep reaching out and keep allowing her to grieve. If she's still cloistered after a month or two, talk to her husband and get her into therapy and a doctor's office. 

Do not expect her to be ok any time soon. Don't say shit like ""your baby is in a better place"" or ""it just wasn't meant to be"" or any of that awful, awful, awful shit. Do not ask her when/if she wants to try again and do not suggest it as a way to feel better. She's not going to feel better any time soon. It's uncomfortable to be around a person who is sad so people try to make sad people not sad. Don't do that. The only things you should say to her should be words that agree with the sentiment of ""This sucks, I am sorry, can I be here for you?"". Support her, listen to her but don't offer advice or ""words of comfort"".

Let her say whatever she wants without judgement. She may lash out, she may blame you or her husband or someone else but she really is blaming herself. Try and reinforce the idea that she's a good person during conversation. ""Oh, I love puppies. Hey sis, remember when you saved that puppy from our next door neighbor? You were so brave--you'd have done anything to save them."" Don't overdo it or you'll sound fake but try to inject anecdotes and examples of her being a good, worthwhile person as much as you can. If she starts in on herself, say something like ""I don't think you're a bad person. Why do you think that?"" She'll have a lot of reasons but nothing that will hold up to questioning so question all of her reasons and supplement with more examples of her not being a bad person. ""I don't think you're selfish. Would a selfish person drive across town to pick up her brother when his car died?"" 

But really, just listen and accept everything she has to say. Motherhood is really complicated--women have these ridonkulous expectations of themselves and of others so there's intense pressure in addition to the regular stress of gestating and raising another person. If you do something differently than someone else, it's ""wrong"" and you're a ""bad parent""--having fertility issues and then miscarrying is really rough. There is this pervasive idea that a woman who has not had children is less of a woman because of it. Some women will say that a woman who has not given drug-free, vaginal birth is less of a woman than a woman who has--it's like a competition and it's hell on women's self esteem. That shit on top of the normal feelings of inadequacy, failure and worthlessness that come along with fertility issues is really hard to deal with at the best of times and this is not the best of times.

keypuncher,conservatives,1390348355.0,"&gt; Is Conservatism at a moment of transformation, when it become the political champion of the poor and sick?

Conservatism has always been the political champion of the poor.  We want the poor to have the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty, while liberals want to trap them in poverty to coerce their votes.

As to the sick, conservatives believe that healthcare is a personal responsibility, or the responsibility of charitable organizations for those in situations unable to fend for themselves.  It is not the responsibility of government.  Liberals want to make government the instrument of forced charity."

Jacksambuck,SubredditDrama,1390349210.0,"&gt;Do you have any proof that feminism as an ideology exclusively puts the blame on men for sexism or patriarchy?

I just gave one to you. What does it mean that women's sexism is internalized, while men's is externalized? Just think about it.

Women are excused for it, men are doing it naturally. 

&gt;Do you have any proof that feminism claims men are unaffected by gender roles? 

I never said they say that. 

&gt;I love men. I'm dating a lovely feminist man. 

Irrelevant, unless you want to claim men with wives can't be misogynists. 

&gt; I do not see this ""blame the men"" thing. I honestly don't see it. Could you help me out by showing me some examples we can discuss? 

Sure, try the article I linked to. 

&gt;I think we’re harsher on our own gender both because those who have “fallen” are a reminder that our own tenuous position in male-dominated social circles is gifted by **men**, and can be as easily taken away

-

&gt;Another explanation for women’s acceptance of benevolent sexism is that it is a form of self-protection in response to **men’s** sexism.

No, the system is far from perfect.

Food stamps, for example, one if your suggestions for stopping people 'wasting' their money - what's to stop people buying food products such as meat and cheese, selling it on for cash, and buying drink/drugs? 

Speaking of luxuries such as alcohol, should a disabled person who cannot work not be allowed to purchase and enjoy a glass of wine at dinner because they are on benefits?

I'm only going to upgrade if I can get NBC, which according to TV fool is available as either 5, 21 or 29. I've never picked it up on 21 or 29 though which is bothering me a bit when choosing an antenna. The lack of NBC is the only glaring hole other than signal drop out with the DIY in place.

Since the first is a bowtie and I'm already getting fairly good results with a poorly constructed DIY I thought it was worth looking at. The two panels can be independently adjusted up to like 45deg so I thought maybe I could face them in a way to get more channels. Maybe not though, I'm not familiar enough.

I'm not that concerned about the VHF Lo stations. I have CBS on 11 and NBC is supposed to be available as either 21 or 29 UHF even if I've not gotten it with my DIY antenna.

John's relationship with Mary isn't purely sexual. It's clear that John needs a romantic and sexual relationship with a woman *as well as* a deeply ""romantic"" but non-sexualized friendship with Sherlock. This hasn't worked in the past (one of his girlfriends demanded he stop making her compete with Sherlock) but it works with Mary. They're a great example of a functional polyamorous family, with John and Sherlock being non-sexual soulmates, John and Mary being a sexually involved married couple, and Mary and Sherlock being sort of co-spouses to John. :)"

I haven't pulled the trigger on a laser printer, I will soon, but just from using Ibotta (the app) I've put $30 in 2 months back into my hands, I've also used store loyalty cards in conjunction with the couponsdotcom site to save $$ on things I usually use (last night's Silk Almond Milk was $1) and stack when I go to Target. Stacking means you have a Target store only coupon, they're running a sale on that item and you have a manufacture's coupon. If you have a Target near you then you can use them because if you get a Red Card you save 5% and if you load Cartwheel the app you save a certain % and if you stack 2 coupons with a sale you can often get free items. This is how I save on basic items in my grocery budget big time. 

Someone above linked to some of the blogs -- even if you just used some of those apps mentioned you'd see a little dent in that grocery budget.

thekillerinstincts,Sherlock,1390351663.0,"&gt;I have a lot of trouble understanding the idea that someone could immediately nix a sexual relationship with another human being based on whether they have a penis or not.

That's just it. People can and do. Perhaps in a world where ""sexual orientation"" wasn't a concept anyone had heard of, this wouldn't happen, but John Watson in particular is absolutely *committed* to people knowing that he isn't gay. He repeats that there's nothing wrong with it, but the fact that he really wants everyone to know that he's straight points to some internalized homophobia (makes sense, especially for a military man). 

Sherlock does not have this same fear. He allows the restauranteur in the first episode to believe that John is his date; when John asks him in the same scene whether he has a boyfriend, he says no, but he's not offended by the idea that he's gay -- rather, he gently corrects John that he's married to the work.

In my opinion, the homoeroticism exists because deep down John does have an inkling of homo-curiosity, even if Sherlock doesn't, and on some level he finds Sherlock attractive. Between two straight friends, this would just be a whim that could be ignored, but Sherlock totally disarms him by not being weirded out by it at all -- and beyond that, they've got that whole soulmate thing going on.

In the end, though, I think John would be put off by sex with Sherlock not solely because of his gender but because can you imagine how *weird* it would be to have sex with Sherlock? He'd probably be incredibly technically skilled, having studied the subject and being able to read his partner's responses so well -- but it would be unrealistic to imagine that he'd be able to be tender and emotionally available during and after the fact. He was able to fake it (to whatever extent) with Janine, but he'd never be able to lie to John like that effectively, and he'd more than likely say some incredibly rude or hurtful things."
