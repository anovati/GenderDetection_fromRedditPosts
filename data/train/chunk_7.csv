Not to mention, in Old English there was the word ""acs"" which meant ""ask"".  Not saying the AAVE word is a direct descendant, but it's worth note.

Bills is stated to be around Gogeta SSJ2. And Super Vegito is stronger than Gogeta SSJ2.

Now as for Goku, evidence suggest that in 10 years time, getting quality training with a being such as Uub allowed him to reach levels far beyond anyone had ever seen in the universe. Using Rhildo as a measurement stick, who is stated to be ""even stronger than Majin Buu"" by Goku, we can see how easily BASE GT KID Goku tools him. Once Goku is transforms into SSJ1, his power skyrockets ""one-hundred fold"" (said by Rhildo) and Goku is EVEN MORE likely to be in the realm of Super Vegito, in fact, I'd say he's 100 times stronger than the level reached by Super Vegito in Z.

Which, given the quality of training Goku had been doing, and given who Goku is and how exponential his progress usually is, would make GT Goku severely weaker than he should be.

Why? what else happened around that time?

A lot of what you're saying describes me at that age fairly well too (except for the kyphoscoliosis, the anger and hitting anyone. I just kept to myself)

I'm still slowly untangling what caused me to curl in on myself like that, but two factors I am aware of are that

- a couple of years before, my parents divorced (it was a perfectly peaceful and friendly thing, they were, and still are, on good terms, so for the longest time I completely dismissed this as having affected me negatively at all. But it was still a major change in my life, and the timing fits)
- after the divorce, my mom moved out of town, and I moved in with my dad and my stepmom, whom I couldn't stand. Long story short, they didn't make room for me in any way (physically, I got a tiny room that doubled as their home office and general storage room, and mentally I just always felt more like a guest (or sometimes a guest worker) than someone who actually had his home there.)

I never had friends visiting me either (and I didn't make as many, or as close, friendships as I had earlier either), I didn't get a girlfriend, I spent most of my time either playing video games or just out/away from everyone. And I didn't interact much with my dad at all either.

I'm still struggling with the fallout from all of this though. I didn't get a girlfriend until my mid/ate 20's, and while I get along well with almost everyone, I rarely make friends with anyone.

As for actual advice? No clue, really.
Well, some of it is just general teenage behavior, I guess.
But as some others have said, be a parent, not a friend. Don't ""joke"" about taking away his computer. Either do it or don't do it. And don't *ever* let him slap you (I'm not saying reciprocate with violence either, but you're his mom, you should have the authority to tell him that that just *does not happen*. And this might be a cultural thing, but sheesh, why are you doing everything in the house? Why don't you make him cook a day or two every week?

But none of that has much to do with the real issue, I think. If you can get him to see a therapist, that might be a good idea. But teenagers are hard to deal with at the best of times. It is entirely possible that you will just have to ride it out, and then help him fix it later, when he is older."

TheToastofBotswana,AskUK,1388923330.0,"The fastest ferry crossing is from Cairnryan (Scotland) to Belfast or Larne (Northern Ireland). It takes about 3 hours. Going as a foot passenger is pretty cheap but you have to book in advance. 

Cairnryan is accessible by bus or train + bus from all the major cities in Scotland. You can then take a short bus ride from either ferry terminal to Belfast city centre.

Train services in Northern Ireland are patchy so if you want to see any of our more rural attractions you'll be getting there by bus or hire-car most of the time (if you don't drive a manual car normally you'll need to book an automatic in advance). There are train services directly from Belfast to Dublin though, and regular buses. As always, buses will be cheaper but take longer. Booking your train tickets in advance is usually cheaper.

You might want to ask specifics about getting around in Ireland on /r/Ireland too."

The biggest worry would be getting KO'd in a single punch. It seems to be that getting hit around the jaw is a good way to knock somebody out (this has never made sense to me but I'm not a boxer), thus the typical ""boxer"" stance with raised fists to protect the face. Attacks would mostly be those of limited opportunity. Backs of knees, inner thighs, groin, inner forearm, upper arm, and neck. I don't have the aim to go for the eyes, or the strength to break bone with a machete. Best case scenario is his own movements help me cut him, by rushing while I go for a thrusting cut. The idea is to either cut something that would severely restrict movement in a way unrelated to pain, and/or cause severe bloodloss. The groin because it seems like PCP-Tyson wants his way with me and he can't do that without his equipment. Even if I can't win, I can stop him from winning.

Emnems,AskWomen,1388923849.0,"I got this second hand but it still makes me want to cry.

My sister in law is a 6th grade school teacher in a poor school district. Over 80% of the kids in the school live below the poverty line. She lives in a relatively small city.

 It was the Friday before winter break began so the kids were all hyper and excited. One of the boys (~11 years old) was waiting in the class room probably for the school bus. Trying to engage him in conversation, she asked him if he had anything planned for Christmas. He told her that he is hoping his christmas present was the dollar it cost to take the bus to the public library so he could check out some books because he liked to read. The family didn't have very much and everyday after school he had to go home to babysit his twin brother who was severely mental disabled. Some asshole of a human being told him his brother was handicapped because while in the womb, he kicked him in the head.

Every time I even think about the guilt that this 11 year old boy carries around with him every day just slays me. Not only does he have it rough living in poverty, going to school in his second language (he speaks Spanish as his first but goes to an english school), and taking care of his twin brother... and all he wants is a fucking book to read."

throw-away-today,TumblrInAction,1388925492.0,"An edited list that I think would make sense:

Being poor is having to keep buying $800 cars because they’re what you can afford, and then having the cars break down on you, because there’s not an $800 car in America that’s worth a damn.

Being poor is going to the restroom before you get in the school lunch line so your friends will be ahead of you and won’t hear you say “I get free lunch” when you get to the cashier.

Being poor is coming back to the car with your children in the back seat, clutching that box of Raisin Bran you just bought and trying to think of a way to make the kids understand that the box has to last.

Being poor is a heater in only one room of the house.

Being poor is stealing meat from the store, frying it up before your mom gets home and then telling her she doesn’t have make dinner tonight because you’re not hungry anyway.

Being poor is Goodwill underwear.

Being poor is feeling the glued soles tear off your supermarket shoes when you run around the playground.

Being poor is thinking $8 an hour is a really good deal.

Being poor is six dollars short on the utility bill and no way to close the gap.

Being poor is never buying anything someone else hasn’t bought first.

Being poor is a box of crayons and a $1 coloring book from a community center Santa.

Being poor is checking the coin return slot of every soda machine you go by.

Being poor is deciding that it’s all right to base a relationship on shelter.

Being poor is a $200 paycheck advance from a company that takes $250 when the paycheck comes in.

Being poor is knowing where the shelter is.

Being poor is people who have never been poor wondering why you choose to be so.

Being poor is seeing how few options you have.

Being poor is running in place.

Being poor is people wondering why you didn’t leave.

Ones I don't actually understand:

Being poor is people angry at you just for walking around in the mall. (are they saying they look homeless or shopkeepers are mad they're not buying anything? I've seen the latter happen.)

Being poor is your kid’s teacher assuming you don’t have any books in your home. (my friend, when I was growing up, was poor. His only entertainment was library books because his family couldn't afford a TV or games. I don't understand this one).

Out of 64, thats 19 (and two ambiguous ones). The rest are problems I've seen people of all classes deal with. 
This is just my opinion and I hesitated posting this because there are some legitimate ones. Then, there are ones like: being poor is having to live with choices you didn’t know you made when you were 14 years old, being poor is getting tired of people wanting you to be grateful, being poor is knowing you’re being judged, ect that are not class specific. I feel like, when there are so so many things that make being poor crippling, this list focuses on really inane and inconsequential things. Being poor isn't your children wanting the things on TV, its not affording a TV. "

Or to put it another way, when it rains it pours.

I've had periods in my life when I went straight from a relationship to having an fwb and somewhat regular one night stands and I've periods where I went months between every time.

And obviously how much effort you put into getting laid affects this as well, if I put almost zero effort into it then I'm lucky to get laid every few months but if I'm actively out pursuing women every weekend then chances are I'm having a one night stand every couple of weeks or so (though the latter approach is pretty tiresome after a while, at least from my perspective as a guy since the expectation in a bar/club environment is for the guy to make the first move).

You should also keep in mind that people who aren't having sex rarely talk all that much about it, so even though your buddy has only had three one night stands in the last four months the only mentions of sex you've heard from him are when he just had sex, he probably won't randomly tell you how he's not gotten laid in two months."

AwhMan,gaybros,1388926850.0,"So I'm a trans guy (born a girl), been on hormones for a while, no surgery so far, and I prefer to have sex using my cunt to be blunt about it, so for obvious reasons the guys I sleep with tend to be bi or a bit more fluid in their sexuality, not just because gay guys funnily enough tend to prefer dick but because I'd rather have sex with someone more experienced with the anatomy I have. 

But anyhows, I was talking to this guy on grindr, I'm perfectly clear about my situation as always, he's cute, he invites me over, I really make sure he really gets it, s'all good, doesn't seem to be a deal to him at all, he's also not weirdly fetishizing me. Cool jams. We hit it off, watch a film order pizza, turns out he's gay so i'm kind of thinking ""oh... ok... But he knows everything so I guess we'll see how it goes?"" we eventually creep closer and closer together bla bla bla We're in the bedroom and we get down to it and he's being super... Gentle? It's hard to describe. It was like a limp handshake, but in the form of sex. Not that his dick was limp, just that he was kind of a wet fish. And it finally clicked that this guy was used to bottoming and had probably also never even had sex with a woman. So I took control a bit more but it's actually physically quite hard to someone with female anatomy to do *all* the work with no input. So I figured he probably wasn't as ok with my body as he thought he would be as well as being a total bottom. Awkward. 

We sleep, I leave in the morning, but then he starts texting me the next day saying what a great time he had and how he wants to see me again... so... I guess he was ok with it? It was just so weird. 

I've had worse sex in terms of like, bad condom brands fucking with my sensitive insides, tickle lube screwing with me - But this was by far the lamest sex. It wasn't exciting in any way.

If the girl is so drunk she is passed out then yes it is rape but if she's just really drunk and still on her feet and he also happens to be drunk and she audibly consented than that is not rape. She willingly got drunk (not passed out drunk) and then said yes to sex. Men aren't absolved of responsibility when they make poor decisions while drunk, why do you think woman should be? If she is standing on her own and audibly consents it is in no way rape just because she regrets it later. If every time I got wasted and slept with a girl I normally wouldn't have sex with and regretted it when sober I was raped than I'd be a multiple rape survivor.

As for MCPC, if you can get a pack to work with MCPC, more power to you.  I was just letting you know that if your users encounter a bug caused by MCPC, most mod authors will not go out of their way to fix it.  And even if your pack is stable with MCPC, won't some people modify the pack (change configs, add mods, etc.)?  If they come up with a crash bug, and open a support ticket or submit a bug report, the mod author might get *frustrated* by getting bug reports for bugs caused by a program he/she doesn't support.

zloebl,feedthebeast,1388930763.0,"Well, when would the spell ever be fully functional?  IIRC, a damage projectile will only trigger the damage when it hits an entity, and an AoE dig projectile will only trigger when it hits a block.  Unless your spell can pierce, the two events can't happen with the same spell, and also can't happen at the same time.  So, the spell has multiple functions, but it can never preform both functions together.

As to the multiple cost thing, I'm not sure if it's a bug or not.  Honestly, I think it makes sense, as much as something magical can every make sense.  Wouldn't it take more energy to throw a projectile that digs the ground in an AoE than to just throw the same projectile into the air?  Of course, that assumes that magic both has a cost, and isn't a type of ""cast and forget"" thing.  Runes kind of debunk the second part of that, though.  Either way, it's confusing, so you might want to bring Mithion's attention to it and see what he says."

Then, you need to do your best to be there, with him, helping and suffering alongside him whenever and wherever the sources of his depression are troubling him.  Don't ask for permission here, because he'll try to push you away, in an effort to preserve your well-being.

And he'll be right.  Diving into that pit of despair along with him is going to hurt you.  It's going to be terrifically hard on your relationship.  But, in a very real way, it's the only way that a person can be pulled out of a depression, and the act of being there,of suffering with him because you choose to, is powerful.

Good luck.  A lot of folks bail on relationships because this sort of thing is too hard.  If you have to, it's legit, if sad."

Meat that has this quality is more ecological than high-intensity grown meat.

**DISCLAIMER:** There's a lot more to my case than ""just"" depression, but since I'm going to talk mostly about the general process of psychiatric treatment I feel that my perspective is still useful.

In regards to the ""feeling numb"" thing:

That's not the desired effect! Many people get that feeling from **some** of the anti-depressive meds (the anti-psychotic pretty much all have this effect and it is often considered ""desired"" because the alternative is, in many cases, way way worse), and that should usually mean that those specific pills are not suited for long term treatment, as very few people can stomach living like that for prolonged periods of time. The good bit is that there are **vast** amount of different meds and they all work a little differently. Everyone is different, and psychiatry is very much a ""we know this *might* work, but we can not know for sure until we try""-thing. No pill works exactly the same on two different people and you need to try different drugs until you find one that works for you.

It can be a pretty arduous process to figure out how the different meds effect you, because it takes roughly 3 weeks before the desired effect actually set in and the initial side-effect wear off. All the meds have side effects, but what you experience in the first three'ish weeks is **not** representative of how it will be in the long run. 

So that's three weeks just to get into a new drug. Then three weeks to up the dosage (a initial doses are usually not high enough). Then perhaps another three weeks for one more adjustment. And then it might not even work well enough to justify the side-effect (this is always a needed consideration. There are **always** side-effects, so you need to weigh whether the good you get from the pill are worth the bad) and you'll have to gradually get out of those meds and then start all o0ver with another product. It takes fucking **ages**, and you feel like shit most of the time during the process.

But there is most certainly something to be gained from it. If you find the right meds, that help you in the way you need without crippling important parts of your life, then it can be, completely literally, a life-saver. I've been in the psychiatric system for near fifteen years now (with several long duration stays at both open and closed psych wards) and my experience, along with that of most people I've gotten to know during those years) is that it **is** worth it in the end.

I have **plenty** bad things to say about that system but in spite of all the problems I have both seen and felt how significant *proper* treatment can be.

I know all too well how hard a process it is. I've been the one to find three different friends after they killed themselves (spent a lot of year living in supervised housing project for nutcases like myself) because they couldn't take it any longer, but I've **also** seen so many others return to the light and reclaim their place in the world despite seemingly impossible challenges. It is worth it to fight; it really really is. Giving up is what eventually will make you off yourself. Don't fucking give up.

PS: Also, exercise is a fucking life-saver. There is simply no way to overstate how much it helps. 

PPS: Getting a blood test done to look for D vitamin defiency is also a good idea here in the winter season. Supplemental vitamin D can help a lot if you're one of the people the suffer from a deficiency. 

PPPS: The single most important part is finding a good psychiatrist. Crappy ones will insist on always pumping the same drug into everyone and refuse to try other approaches and types because they're either taking money from that company or are just incompetent or lazy. A good one will take part in evaluating every single fucking step of the way and will *never* be afraid of adjusting dosages or trying other solutions if the current treatment is not working optimally. Do **NOT** settle for a bad psychiatrist. It is, quite literally, a life or death situation."

dewprisms,changemyview,1388933196.0,"&gt; This is true, but it still leaves us obligated to reform to a vegetarian diet.

Based on your arguments re: vegetarianism and consent of animals, we would actually be obligated to be vegan and not vegetarian, which is even more difficult to do, and nigh impossible for even more people in the world than being vegetarian is. On top of that, ""moving towards"" vegetarianism globally is impossible at this point. And unless something incredibly drastic changes, it will be for centuries to come due to the complexities of food distribution, ability to grow food in specific places, the need for animals for other things that go hand in hand with eating them (such as poor areas where they need animals for labor purposes, clothing, etc.)

When I mentioned nutrition as well, I meant things like eggs and milk. These are integral foods to places that are poor but can afford to keep livestock, especially places that are already largely vegetarian, so you didn't address that (my apologies for not being clearer.)

The OP made an argument that killing animals is surely worse than beastiality. However, in order to eliminate all animals that we have that are domesticated, we would have to let them all die off or actively kill them. The world is simply not in a place right now where we can get rid of our domesticated animals.

Yes, this does devolve to consent. However, raping an animal also does not benefit the animal in any way. Having a domesticated animal does benefit it (again, assuming it is not being abused.) Shelter, food, care, companionship. Turning out all cats and dogs into the streets would have massive impacts on both humans, cats and dogs, and the native wildlife. The only alternative would to be to stop their procreation forcibly or to actively kill them. Surely the animals cannot consent to that either. And because we've basically put ourselves in the position of having domesticated animals it is now our responsibility to be good stewards to them and care for them as optimally as we can, which incidentally does not include raping them.

I wanted to hang out with my coworkers because they all hung out after work and had a good time, and I was never invited because it was always at bars I was too young to go to. One day a coworker's friend/regular invited me to hang out. I come over later, as the industry makes us work late. I make myself a small drink and have that. Then my coworker shows up and he joins. We all do a shot and smoke some weed, then the friend makes me a drink. At this point I've had a total of 3 ounces of alcohol and after a few sips of that drink I start to feel tired so I lay down for a bit. Next thing I know buddy is sliding his hands up my shirt and down my pants, undoing my bra etc and I'm saying no repeatedly. My coworker was gone too. I eventually pass out during this.

I wake up still woozy, which is weird as I mentioned I hadn't had much to drink, only 4 ounces (and I'm some form of an alcoholic and can drink 26 ounces before feeling ill) and go to work for 10 hours. I noticed my bra was undone when I woke up, later that my underwear was on sideways and my ass was bleeding all day.

I still was't sure until he next day I was having sex with my, for lack of a better term, boyfriend, and my vagina hurt and I started gushing blood (not period).

I had work at two jobs and my first manager was understanding but the manager at the other place, where the regular went, made me come in. He asked what happened and I said I was raped. He knew what night I said it happened and who I was with and didn't believe me, saying I was just black out and did something I regretted. He then proceeded to tell all of my coworkers that night without my permission that I was a lying false rape accuser.

Graham. He specifically addresses this myth as it's one that gets under his skin every time he hears it.

Here's the snippet from the book:
&gt;This is a good time to dispel one of the many myths about the SR-71. On the Discovery Channel they frequently show an SR-71 video where the narrator states, ""The SR-71 leaks fuel so profusely it has to refuel after takeoff."" Whenever I hear this comment, my blood pressure begins to rise, as nothing could be further from the truth. Where do these documentary filmmakers find their experts? There are several reasons we generally (but not always) refueled right after takeoff. We routinely flew one mission out of Okinawa with no refuelings! It was called the ""Rocket Ride"" and lasted a total of fifty-seven minutes from takeoff to touchdown. 

&gt;The fuel reached temperatures well over three hundred degrees Fahrenheit during Mach 3 cruise, making the fumes in each of the six fuel tanks very volatile and susceptible to exploding. One of our aircraft limitations was a maximum speed of Mach 2.6 without an inert atmosphere in the fuel tanks. The only way to ensure a one hundred percent inert atmosphere in each fuel tank was to fill the plane completely full of fuel, allowing the gaseous nitrogen to dominate the fuel tank's empty space above as it burned off the JP-7. This is why we refueled after takeoff. 

&gt;However, there was another way to achieve this, but it was a maintenance nightmare, called a ""Yo-Yo."" A few of our missions required the SR-71 to accelerate to Mach 3+ right after takeoff with sixty-five thousand pounds of fuel. The Yo-Yo procedure had the crew chief completely refuel his plane to full tanks of eighty-eight thousand pounds. Then, with the nitrogen pressurization system working, he de-fueled fifteen thousand pounds of JP-7, ending up with a sixty-five thousand-pound fuel load and a plane that was capable of immediately going to Mach 3+ cruise. 

&gt;We never took off with a full load of eighty thousand pounds of JP-7 because the gross weight of the aircraft made our single-engine capability non-existent immediately after liftoff. If one engine flamed out at the wrong time during takeoff, the large yawing moment (a torque effect with the engine flamed out) created by the afterburning engine could only be stopped by coming out of afterburner on the remaining engine. Once you did that, there was insufficient thrust to keep the plane flying. 

&gt;For example, a fully loaded SR-71 with eighty thousand pounds of fuel, sea-level conditions, eighty-six degrees Fahrenheit, out of ground effect (about thirty feet in the air), the minimum aerodynamic control speed was well over 280 knots. That's the airspeed at which the SR-71 finally became controllable when one engine flamed out on takeoff. If you lost an engine right after takeoff, it would be hard to explain to your boss why the plane didn't fly on one engine when the performance charts told you it couldn't. Consequently, we only took off with one of three fuel loads: forty-five thousand, fifty-five thousand, or sixty-five thousand pounds of fuel. Infrequently, the Palmdale flight test crews would take off with eighty thousand pounds of fuel if they couldn't get tanker support and needed to fly. 

&gt;Another reason we refueled right after takeoff is that the tanker crews needed the practice, and so did we.

Silly_little_pet,AskMen,1388935146.0,"There's no doubt that my case and that of your boyfriend is incomparable. Depressions are mainly a ""side-effect"" for me. I'm diagnosed with [SPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder) and an unspecified severe sleeping disorder (they've given up on the last bit after looking for a fitting label for 15 years), so my problems are in a pretty different direction :)

But he should absolutely know that the emotional numbness from the anti-depressants is not the intended effect and is not something that happens with all of them. I've been on some that had that effect on me and for a long while I thought that was just how it was. Then, because of other side effects, I was switched a another drug that *didn't* have that effect on me. Imagine my surprise! :D

It sounds like he's dealing pretty well with his situation. My advice would be to focus less on ""cheering him up"" and more on make sure that he knows you still like him, respect him and care about him even when he's down. Things can get pretty dark in a depression and attempt to ""distract"" can often feel as a lack of respect for how bad you're feeling. I've adopted a ""I can see you feel like shit. That's absolutely ok! I still like you and and respect you and if you want or need my help with anything to get through this a little easier then you need just call""-approach when people near me are tackled by the brain.

As far as exercise go, it's mainly the standard cardio stuff that helps. Lifting is never a bad thing, of course, but it doesn't provide as tangible results for me as, say, running. I don't have any hard numbers to back this up (although I've read several articles that discussed the positive impact of exercise on treatment, as well as prevention, of depression), so I can just speak from my own perspective. 

I'm at ""my best"" when I run daily. Doesn't have to be long trips or anything; any distance from 3km and up will do it for me. That is my optimal case. I can get by almost as well with two-three runs a week, and I can ""survive"" with a single trip a week if it's not for a prolonged period. It should, however, be noted that I'm medicated with very low doses exactly *because* I prefer to handle most of the ""treatment"" through exercise, so that is absolutely a factor in how quickly I become mentally scrawny if I don't keep it up.

A few miscellaneous suggestions to how you can support him when things get rough:

(This is not objective on any way; It's simply things that I have personally experienced helping me when I'm struggling with depression)

- Go shopping for him. It can help a lot to have a filled fridge and not have to worry about getting proper food. You can simply ask if it'd be a help if you brought some groceries by and the left again. Often you'd love to see a friendly face but you're unable to handle actually talking to other people.

- Offer to take care of whatever pressing ""adult"" business there might be piling up. It can be paying bills (of course not with your own money, just the act of actually getting it done), opening mail, calling in sick, rescheduling an appointment, and so on. These things tend to become massive hurdles when you're depressed.

- Offer to help doing random stuff. Not do it *for* him, but *with* him. Cleaning your place can seem like an insurmountable task when you're down, but doing it together with another person while listening to some music or something, can make it a lot easier.

- Offer to do things with him and make sure he knows that you're aware that his energy reserves are limited. ""I know you feel like shit and don't have much energy, so when/if you run out and need to kick me out, just give the word. I'm expecting it and I'm 100% ok with it"". Note that this one should only be done if you are *actually* ok with him suddenly going ""Shit, I'm spent. I need to go lock myself in my bedroom and stare at a wall for 12 hours straight"" :)

Finally: Massive props to your for your approach to this. You're going about it in a very healthy and positive way. These are *his* problems and that will never change. You can not solve them for him; but you **can** help make it a bit easier and a bit less painful :)

PS: To answer your specific question. I have never ""recovered"". What is ""wrong"" with me can not be cured. I'm simply slightly different from the majority of humans. But I *have* learned an amazing amount about where my brain is different and how to create a positive and constructive life in spite of these differences. I'll never be ""normal"", in any stretch of the word, but I've learned to be happy. And that is a fuckload more than I thought possible fifteen years ago :)"

ShredDurst,stunfisk,1388935207.0,"One advanced thing you can do when determining how much HP to use is to see how residual damage affects you. Since the game effectively rounds down when doing damage calculations (though what's actually happening is slightly more complicated), you can manipulate your HP to take advantage of it. For example: if you are running a Life Orb set with some HP investment, you'd want an HP that is one less than divisible by 10 to minimize the recoil damage while still keeping a relatively high HP. A LO user with 160 HP will take 16 damage from the LO, while a LO user with 159 HP will take 15. You end up on top after the second attack.

Besides these specific situations, you generally want to EV whichever base stat is lower, since EVs are more valuable the lower a stat is. A Pokemon with low HP and high defenses will benefit more from more HP investment, and a Pokemon with high HP and low defenses will want to invest in those defenses."

It's one thing to say ""[SOME OTHER APPROACH] might be a better solution but if you have to do it this way then you could try [APPROACH COMPATIBLE WITH QUESTION PARAMETERS]"" it's another to say ""You're doing it wrong, do it this other way instead"".

Ex's mom, B, converted because her husband is Jewish. She is big in her community, goes to temple, is friends with the people in her congregation. I don't know how it was when she was seeking to convert and actually doing it but she is very happy with it now. 

My classmate, M, practices Conservative Judaism and married into a religious/practicing family. She keeps kosher and all that. Her in-laws are very accepting of her and I believe her step dad's family was also very accepting of her mother and her when they first converted. 

I also have a friend who was thinking of converting while in college and he spoke with a rabbi there who was very encouraging and informative to him.

Then just as I was climbing off, she said, no no no don't stop….  tell me what you'd do to me, tell me what I deserve… some stuff like that.  I stopped what I was doing and helped her get dressed.

piggybankcowboy,PandR,1388935758.0,"You can bandy words and phrases like ""hipsters"" and ""before it was cool"" around all you want, if it makes you feel any better, but the fact is that yes, when the group gets too large, the content goes to shit because everyone is clamoring for attention and either grasping at making extremely weak connections or presenting old material with this ""new to me"" mentality that is the bane of aggregate sites such as this. If you can't understand that (especially from the perspective of the site proper, and not just this sub) without getting defensive about it, then you are part of the problem. 

That said, just watch. Eventually you will also tire of people beating dead horses, running the joke into the ground, and turning damned near everything everything into a meme. You will become jaded as your favorite places on the internet become so bastardized that you are forced to ask yourself why you keep going there anymore. My comment wasn't meant to be mean, but to illustrate how, as a community grows, it loses it's focus. And if you want further proof of this, look beyond the Internet into some of our global or regional social issues. "

My country may simply be boring, but I've never heard of a cinema, park or other location that was used by girls to hook up. There is, however, five such places for guys just in my neighborhood.

So. there you have it folks, the trolls created the humans, now you understand the purpose of the Incipishpere

I'd like to hear from the newcomers here, what do you think of this new revelation? About the game? What do you think the demon is? Something new? Something we know? Some doge? What do you think the scratch is?

I ask this because, sadly, you can only read something for the first time once :(

Anyway, prepare yourself for the best sub-act, back to beta kids :D

PS: OMFG it's Friday and I'm bored let's read Homestuuuccck. Arguably, the next Act is the best act.

Favorite Flashes:

&gt;[1](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006009). [[S] Cascade: Can it really be beaten? All that work and creativity coming together? If it can, I will proudly crown Andrew Hussie the greatest artist of all time!](/spoiler)

&gt;[2](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004827). [[S] Jade: Enter: Such chills, such epicness, it wasn't easy for number 1 to beat this.](/spoiler)

&gt;[3](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003840). [S] Descend: I find it funny this made it this high. I think this was the moment the Homestuck really grabbed me. [Until now, I expected them to gradually complete the game and come together at a final fight against the black king, following a set storyline of something like say Avatar: The Last Airbender.](/spoiler) This showed to me that the story in itself was not going to follow it's own rules and anything could happen.

&gt;[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007138)/[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007152). [[S] Dirk: Synchronize\Unite (Counts as one): I love the way Hussie is able to make these connections and let everything flow together, it's a really amazing thing](/spoiler)

&gt;[5](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003049). [S] Enter: OK I'll admit when I first read the story I wasn't really involved in it (I skipped the Midnight Crew Intermission :$). This finally got me to say, huh this looks like it could be pretty interesting.

&gt;[6](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006290). [[S] END OF ACT 6 INTERMISSION 1: I love this one because it's pretty much foreshadowing Act 6 and in a really beautiful way.](/spoiler)

&gt;[7](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007161). [[S] Caliborn: Enter.: And the big bad wolf is revealed. This was a really sad moment for me, mainly because this is the planet from [S] Roxy: Sleepwalk and, to me, it has the same connotations as burning a book. That instantly made me hate LE. Well played, Hussie, well played.](/spoiler)

&gt;[8](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004987). [[S] JOHN. RISE UP.: One of the prettiest songs I've heard in Homestuck, this flash really evokes emotion in you.](/spoiler)

&gt;[9](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006386). [[S] Roxy: Sleepwalk.: This one is really cool beacause it pretty much shows all the places the story has brought us, makes you realize just how big paradox space really is...](/spoiler)

&gt;[10](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004888). [[S] ==&gt;: The Forst and Frogs introduction. It's just beautiful.](/spoiler)

&gt;[11](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007338). [[S] ACT 6 ACT 4: Another storyteller flash. This one pretty much sums up all of the B2 kid's session in just a few minutes. And only using imagery. I find it fascinating how artists are able to do this sort of thing.](/spoiler)

&gt;[12](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002926). [S] Jade: Dream up extra arms and play advanced bass solo.: This one pretty much made me remeber that these kids are into something really big.

&gt;[13](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006472). [[S] Prince of Heart: Rise up.: Really good animation in this one, made me realize how much Hussie's skill has been improving over the past few years.](/spoiler)

&gt;[14](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=008178). [[S] ACT 6 ACT 6 INTERMISSION 1: Another great example of how Hussie's art is improving. Really make the comic feel alive](/spoiler)

&gt;[15](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003701). [S] WV?: Rise up.: We finally get to see the battlefield and the big war that's happening. A really good worldbuilder flash.

&gt;[16](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003500). [S] John: Reunite with your loving wife and daughter.: Does this really need an explaination? HOW DO I LIIIIVE WITHOUT YOUUUU???

&gt;[17](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005660). [[S] Flip.: A really really cool showdown. The glitches just make it more epic IMO.](/spoiler)

&gt;[18](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004478). [S] Make her pay.: A really cool summation of the A2 troll's session and a great interpretation of Vriska's revenge. Amazing artwork as well, the differing styles are a really great supplement"

IrideTheDirt,MensRights,1388936896.0,"Feminism is rooted in precisely that which it is defined as. Modern feminists have had to find new things to fight for, to argue about, and to be offended and upset by. Are the issues women face non-issues?  no, not at all, but they are comparable to what men face, and while there ought to be organizations fighting to continue working toward an egalitarian society, many of the causes and talking points of feminism have stepped beyond the definition of working for equality, and are instead focused on elevating women to a point of privledge, which is viewed as ""equality"" by the feminist movement. 
what it boils down to...

If the feminist movement were to admit that in the US and most first world nations, women's rights have essentially pulled up alongside men's. To admit this would cause a breakdown of the current goals and agenda of feminism, and it would simultaneously be admitting men's rights issues are just as relevant and real as the issues women still face, and truly DO NEED advocacy for.  Egalitarianism should be the goal, and still is, of many feminists. Many feminists indeed want the same thing, but they buy into the agenda of the feminist movement with little to no question."

Arcturus_,AskMen,1388937091.0,"All of them.

I start on the treadmill each day walking and running for about an hour and a half. After that I focus on one or two muscle groups that will not conflict with each other. This way on the next day if I'm sore I can workout another muscle group and give my sore ones a rest. I personally choose to do shoulders alone but some people like to do them with arms.

As for ""arms"" I also separate those into two days. Bicep and Tricep. I've been doing Bi/Chest for a while and love the mixup, alternatively I do Tri/Back on a different day. Sometimes if my back or chest is too sore I'll do Bi or Tri with calves. 

Personally I like to leave leg day to itself, as many others do as well. Some hate leg day but I love it. I have very strong legs so it's an easy day and I get a lot done. I also work on forearms on leg day sometimes too.

Rest day I just make sure my activity is light, I may even still go to the gym, walk a mile and go home. If it's nice out I'll usually go throw a football around for a couple hours. Just don't let yourself be stiff and idle.

A lot of people allow them self a cheat day but I figure what's the point? I'll end up working it off tomorrow and really not be ahead. Instead I go by a strict..ish diet. I eat well for the most part and 99% of the time I drink bottled water, though Ive done that for like 6 or 7 years. The odd time I'll have a can of pop or iced tea. I've had pizza and mcdonalds and wings and I still continue to lose weight and stay on track. My theory on this is I'm not stressing myself out saying I have to eat bland veggies, skinless boneless chicken, and whole wheat every day so I stay on track. I just make sure to stay within my caloric limit each day and I keep moving forward.

That's not to say don't eat chicken veggies and whole wheat, it is good for you and I do eat that 80% of the time. Literally half my plate every night is veggies, though I absolutely love them so it's no big deal for me.

My philosophy for all of this is do it right and work your ass off but remember its a lifestyle change. Realistically you're going to mess up sometimes and you're going to want to pig out on a bag of chips but it's all about living better and healthier and being the best you that you can be. You'll stick with it if you remember this. You won't see results every day, and don't weigh yourself every day. I do it Mondays and Thursdays.

Find some workouts that you can do as a starter it's important to not rush out of the gate, it's a marathon not a sprint. Track your progress and stay within your limits. I started out 8 months ago doing 10 minutes on the treadmill and being exhausted now I go 90 and always want more. 

Good luck, hope this wall of text helps you out some."

POP POP, you shoot the side-passenger bandit in the neck and in the head, blood spraying all over the dashboard, and you keep pointing at the driver bandit, saying: ""Don't do anything stupid, or this could go really bad for you."". Of course he's going to do something stupid -you thought to yourself- he's a goddamn bandit. And lo and behold, he grabs his pistol and starts shooting everywhere. Quick and effectively, you put your gun next to his temple and pull the trigger twice. POP POP. You open the car's door and throw yourself out, protecting your head from possible damage. The car crashes into a tree and explodes in a hollywood-esque fashion. As you get on your feet, you find yourself surrounded by naked women. Lord Rocket2guns shows up from the heavens accompanied by a choir of singing angels, He Himself handing you the Golden Can of Beans of Epic Bandit-Slaying Epicness.

Sure, you can block them off with smokes or flash them but quite often if they keep holding the angle they can just hold down mouse1 and get kills anyway. Would a reduction in clip size for the autosnipers down to 15 and enough reserve ammo for 2 more clips be fair for them? They only need 5-10 bullets to kill 5 players anyway. That would leave them with 30 more bullets to spray through doors or walls which seems fair enough to me, but I'm not a high-level player so maybe I'm talking out of my ass haha."

And for one thing, River never communicated with the Doctor in his time stream. He hadn't entered it; it was Clara that was in there, and River could still communicate with the Doctor because Clara really was still alive to maintain the connection.

&gt;The flirtatious nature between The Doctor and Tasha is eerily similar to how he interacts with River.""

Because it's ***impossible*** for him to flirt with a different person, of course.

&gt;Tasha’s chambers in design are eerily similar to the way “The Library” appeared during Tennants run.

I don't see it, but so what if they were? The interior of the TARDIS looked eerily similar to the inside of a hospital once. And need I remind you about how people overreacted when they noticed that they reused Jenny's chair for Oswin?

&gt;The Doctor refers to Tasha as someone that has been “fighting the psychopath in her all  her life”. The only other person he’s even used that term to describe is River.

And now he's used it for Tasha. Yes. People can have similar descriptions made of them.

&gt;Tasha can fly the TARDIS rather well.

Anyone can if they're taught. Romana could fly it too.

&gt;If Amy does in fact perish at 87, then it would not be out of the realm of possibility for her still to be alive and be Clara’s grandmother.

Yes it would. That grave is there in 2012. Clara's family are in 2013. Amy is not Clara's grandmother.

So, author, if you're so convinced that Tasha is River having survived the Library, answer me this:

Why did she ask the Doctor if his body was a new one? Surely River wouldn't have forgotten the incarnation she spent most of her time with, right?

IrideTheDirt,MensRights,1388938255.0,"I'm a welder fabricator. I've worked in the trade for nearly 10 years. I attended trade school at the community college, there was one girl in the class. increasing enrollment for women in the welding class by 100% would mean one more woman...  Anyway, here is my take on women in the trades: 
1. Women in the trades would, as the article said, feel as though they've got something to prove, and as though they need to be at LEAST on the same level as their coworkers, but also trying to be better to prove a point, that women can do this work as well as men. 

2. There is a distinct lack of YOUNG PEOPLE in the trades in america, because the education system has taught high school aged kids that college is the only route to go for success, that trades are for people too stupid for college. The average age of the American welder is 55! The trades are drastically understaffed, and the people doing these jobs are aging, and approaching retirement faster than there are people to replace them. which brings me to #3...

3. Providing specific programs for women to encourage them to become involved in the trades is EXACTLY what I want to see. But I also want to see gender neutral programs to try to counter the brainwashing of the public school system telling kids that blue collar trade work is for the dumb, college and office work is for the smart. I want to see programs that attempt to show that there are good paying jobs available for those willing to work. programs like ""Mike Rowe Works"", really.  Mike Rowe's foundation provides scholarships to PEOPLE (men and women) who are willing to get dirty, work hard, and earn a living. I'd like to see more of that.

4. Back to my first point. Women in the trades are there because they WANT TO BE, and because of that will do a better job than guys who are there because their school system basically told them that this is a job for fuckwits who are too stupid for a real career. It's not hard to out-do guys who are there because they needed a job that paid better than fast food and they have a strong back, when you WANT to be there, have a passion for what you're doing, and take pride in your work. That said, as a stereotype, women often do have an eye for detail that men can sometimes lack, and I've heard from a few reputable folks (Nick Offerman for example) that women make fantastic wood workers. 

5. This is obviously a story BECAUSE there are so few women in the trades. And I'm happy to see an increase in women working in the trades. It's a brash environment though, and to be very honest, I expect to see more sexual harassment cases coming from the trade industry as more women get involved. The trades attract a lot of folks who you could call ""rough and tumble"" or ""rough around the edges"" and these sorts of folks speak freely and like off color jokes. precisely the kind of behavior that needs a filter when you're around folks who don't appreciate that sort of humor.   

It's in interesting concept to think about for sure. but I'll tell you, I support urging women to get involved in the trades, especially because with all the emphasis on urging women to get into the STEM fields, I feel that ignoring the trades where women make up less of the work force continues to send the message that trades work is for the stupid, when there are good paying jobs that we cannot fill because nobody wants to be a plumber anymore.

kowalski71,UserCars,1388938314.0,"I would advise using 2.5 little known craigslist features.

1) Search boolean. This is mostly useful for possible misspellings. You can google what all the actual symbols are but I use () and |. () denote exactly, just like quotes in google, and | denotes OR. So you could search for:

    1988|88 nissan (desert runner)|(dessert runner)|(desert-runner)

And get any possible spelling of the name.

2) You can turn any craigslist search into an RSS feed. In the bottom right hand corner of the screen is an orange 'RSS' button. Click on that and you can add that search to an RSS reader. If you're not familiar with RSS, think of it like a system of email updates for blog posts. You get an RSS reader (I recommend Feedly) and you can subscribe to various blog and website feeds to get notified when new articles or content go up. This makes it easy to check a ton of CL searches from different cities.

2.5) This tip doesn't get a whole number because it's not really a craigslist tip but you can search international CL from google by searching in the domain craigslist.org. This would have this tag somewhere in every search:

    site:craigslist.org

This is searching Google's archives of CL not CL directly so it won't pick up brand new ads and sometimes it'll list ads that have been deleted."

Silly_little_pet,AskMen,1388938586.0,"Generally speaking, anti-depressants are not well suited for short term treatment, because they take quite a while to ""get going"". This, on top of the problem of actually noticing when you're depressed (it usually happens gradually) can too often mean that there's been significant impact to social life and general situation before the treatment has a chance to do anything.

I know a few people that only take them during the winter half of the year, but that is only really useful if winter is a certain, and the only, cause of depression. 

But I would still advice asking a good psychiatrist about it. They have access to all the research and all the book, on top of a ton of experience, and will be much better suited to judge whether or not on/off medication might be a good idea. It's really important to remember that, at its best, psychiatry is all about adapting to the unique case of the individual patient and his/her needs.

And yea, those side-effects are among the more common ones. But again, those also differ from drug to drug. There are almost always *some* side-effects, but some of them are not too hard to deal with and hell, some are even wanted by some people. I was on some once that made it a lot harder for me to get off. I still could, but it took like three times as long. If that was something I'd had troubles with then that'd be a pretty nifty side-effect :)

And worth noting again is that the effects during the first three to four week are **not** representative for long-term treatment. The vast majority of those will either go away completely or become a lot less severe. The hardest part of getting into medication is to not panic during that initial period. It's so fucking easy to go ""oh hell no, this shit fucks me waaaay to much up!"", and then stop taking it, weeks before the drugs has had a chance to show its positive effects and the bad things to subside or tone down.

I do not suggest that everyone with depression is better off taking meds. I'm actually a firm advocate of avoiding them if possible. But it should be for the right reasons. It's counter-productive to avoid them out of fear or lack of knowledge. They're not always a good fit, but they *can* help immensely and in a great many cases it'd be a good idea to at least give a few different products a fair shake. If they turn out to not be worth it then you can always phase them out again. Sure, it's a fucking hassle, but for the potential benefit I honestly think it's worth the fight.

And yea, an exercise bike or a treadmill will work just fine. I personally use a treadmill at the gym during the winter, and although I don't get that same ""wind in my face while furiously outrunning all my rage and fear""-feeling I still get the mental and emotional stability that is the main reason for me to do it :)"

I told we I saw her with her ex boyfriend and at first she tried denying it. I told her to get out of the house and she started punching me on the face. I grabbed her and threw her on the wall, which was a huge mistake since she bruised easily. I ran outside to try to call the cops on my cell and couldn't get a signal so I walked up the street. I then heard a car speeding towards me. It was her, she was trying to run me over because I called her out on her infidelity. I got a hold of the cops and they came to my house. But they got a hold of her first, who was let me remind you was operating a vehicle drunk. She played the victim and told them that I made up a bunch of lies to get at her. I tried telling the cop what happened and they told me that I should just leave my house and find somewhere else to go. I was mad because I payed for my house and I was being treated like I had done everything.  I slept at my buddy's house that night but while I was over there she had wired all my money from my account to hers. She knew my password and everything because she was ""my wife.""

From the cost estimates for doing so and completing the wall, we'd start being in the black in the second year after removing all the illegals.

As for smuggling, this is smuggling only in the sense that it is bringing illegal merchandise across the border - the border itself is largely unprotected, so they're just walking across - by the millions."

If the limiting magnitude is around +5, then you can start seeing the milky way clearly, and around +6 it starts becoming much more detailed. A normal person is able to see an apparent magnitude of as low as +7 outside of the city on a clear night (more positive magnitude is lower light), and I know that I personally can see in the +8 - +8.5 range (The pleiades test is fun for me, because as long as there are no clouds in the way I can always count over a dozen stars), so seeing the milky way in extreme detail is greatly possible in a fair number of geographical locations.

EvanYork,Christianity,1388940338.0,"I don't think the first one is really all that ridiculous.  There are plenty of sources to back up the idea that Jews around Jesus' time had eschatological ideas consistent with some of what Jesus did (the Son of God/Messiah thing is attested to at least a century before Christ).  I'm not saying there is nothing in Jesus that was inconsistent with the eschatology of the time (the second coming thing is the big one), but a quick glance at apocryphal Jewish apocalyptic literature shows a lot of ideas that were eventually used by Christianity but abandoned by orthodox Judaism (Fallen angels, for example).  The normative Jewish understanding of prophecies isn't the only one ever, its just the one that beat out the other ones, and Jesus wasn't nearly as inconsistent with some of these dead views as he is with the now dominant view.

To stray a little outside of facts and into my own interpretation of things, I believe one reason the current Jewish eschatology (and several other doctrines) developed was specifically in opposition to Christianity.  We developed the trinity to explain why Arians and Modalists were heretics.  Jews developed a coherent understanding of their prophecies to explain exactly why Christians were heretics.

**TL;DR: The normative Jewish understanding is not the only historical understanding of Jewish eschatology, and the Christian understanding is to some degree rooted in these unorthodox Jewish beliefs.**"

temp9876,AskWomen,1388940545.0,"Unfortunately I have.  When I was younger I worked late shifts and my roomate waitressed at a couple of clubs on peak nights (Wed - Sat).  After work I would go to her bar and help her scam extra tips, a guy who wanted to buy either her or I a drink would pay for a drink and I would drink a Shirley Temple (non-alcoholic) which was technically on the house since I was almost always DD.  My job paid our rent, her tips bought us food, we didn't really have money for booze.  On the nights she didn't work we would go to a different bar with the same owner, something of a dive.  We just liked to go dancing, tell you what, that's an amazing way to stay in shape.

Anyway, you would think that knowing all the staff and regulars we would be relatively safe from shenanigans, right?  No.  On three separate occasions I got ""drunk"" from my Shirley Temples.  I don't mean there was liquor in it, when you don't drink very often you notice that right quick.  I don't remember them tasting off, but it was those big pony jugs so I don't know if I should have.  

Fortunately we were obsessively safe partiers and if I said I felt weird we were out of there and inseparable, RIGHT NOW.  I can't stress how important it was that we had good friends and good rules for staying safe.  

Nothing dreadful ever came of it.  I never knew what happened.  Later when I started dating my husband one of the bartenders made me a Singapore Sling (Shirley Temple + Gin) that was basically straight gin, like he was trying to do the guy buying me the drink a favor.  Since then I have sort of suspected that it was coming from behind the bar but it's just speculation.

That friend and I are no longer on good terms, but I still miss having a good party buddy.  I can't tell you how frustrating it was trying to go out with different friends when you're used to that standard, end up chasing them around trying to keep tabs on each other and talk them out of doing stupid shit while slammed.  They should be drilling safe party skills into your head all through high school.  It wouldn't save everyone but I firmly believe it saved me."

However, now, I don't know. On one hand, if we could sign Vick, draft Clowney (sorry) or Sammy Watkins, maybe we could address QB in 2015 with Mariota, Hundley, Winston or Petty. But on the other hand, that would entail another season of awfulness, and I don't know if I can handle that. If we're gonna win 4-5 games, I'd prefer it's with a rookie QB that shows promise, and not a perennially injured 33 year old QB, probably getting our head coach fired, and then we're in the same situation we are now, except with Clowney/Watkins.

Furthermore, there was no reason to say something everybody already agreed on. From /u/FlareCorran: ""He was a 1st century Jew who publicly agreed with the Law of Moses. He didn't make statements about it, because it would be like coming on reddit and announcing that you disagree with racism. There's no point to it.""

Moreover, when it comes to marriage, Jesus believed in the ""traditional"" marriage of 1 man and 1 woman. “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them **male and female**, and said, Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh"" (Matthew 19)

Also, John 4:34 and John 14:23 talk about how Jesus is doing the will of his Father, and anybody who loves Jesus loves the Father. According to the Old Testament, homosexuality is wrong. And since the Old Testament is divinely inspired, it means homosexuality is against the will of God, therefore against Jesus's will.

Lastly, in John 16:12 Jesus states that he has many truths to tell the disciples, but he cannot at the time; so instead he will send the Holy Spirit would come and guide them to the truth. Paul's letters were inspired by the Holy Spirit which speaks on Christ's behalf."

There's a joke about a Yiddish speaker asking how to say *vinde* in English, when it's just ""window"" assimilated into Yiddish phonology.  And the usual word for ""skirt"" in American Yiddish is *skoyt*, which is the approximation of ""skirt"" with the curl-coil merger found in Brooklyn."

There are [several reasons](http://www.therefinersfire.org/disputing_messiah2.htm) to reject that idea.  The curse on Jeconiah's line appears to have been revoked, as 1.) Jeceniah did have children, many of them, 2.) His grandson Zerubbabel was an extremely righteous ruler, and 3.) Language referring to his Zerubabbel in the Bible functions to ""break the curse"" on Jeceniah's line - Jeconiah is a signet ring that has been cast off, and Zerubbabel is the signet ring on the hand of the LORD."

bluesky747,MakeupAddiction,1388941554.0,"I worked at a SiJCP for a while, but I can't imagine that the training for that was less than a free standing store.

I went in with an okay understanding of makeup and no professional experience in the field whatsoever. So if you're worried about not having enough experience, I wouldn't be.

They train you a lot on skincare and makeup. There aren't really lessons on DOING the makeup on clients, you kinda just have to do it and get the hang of it. There's also a test called a CMA (which is basically the 30min makeovers) where a Sephora Rep comes in and tests you while you do a full face on someone. I worked there for 6 months and I didn't have to do a CMA though. I did express services and some full faces during events.

Be prepared to watch a lot of videos and get a lot of knowledge of products thrown at you at once. There's a lot to know. The managers also make you do roleplay with them in order to help sell products better.

One of the best things are the gratis. Gratis are free gifts that the store gives you and they're usually full sized items. Skincare, makeup, brushes...anything! I got Philosophy's Time in a Bottle as a gratis once and gave it to my Mother in Law, and she never used it and now I'm kicking myself cause I wish I'd kept it.

Hmm..what else....every employee got a brush belt to use on clients. They teach you sanitation techniques and such. They teach you how to color match, use the Color IQ, and actually through experience you'll start to notice you can pick out people's undertones and surface tones by eye, almost perfectly, and finding foundation for clients will get much easier.

As a requirement, you have to go to work with a full face. So be prepared to spend 2-3 hours on your makeup for work. Sometimes there are specific looks that are agreed upon, whether for an event or for fun, but sometimes mimicking looks from instagram or a picture somewhere takes a while, so make sure you allow enough time for messing up, starting over, etc. 

The best thing about this job is really the experience, skills, and knowledge you acquire (and the free stuff!) I'm WAY better at makeup now that I've had the experience, and it really has helped me on my way to starting freelance MUA. Oh, also, if you do freelance right now, be prepared to have Sephora tell you to stop doing it because it's a conflict of interest. My boss randomly came up to me one day and was like, ""You know you can't do clients' makeup outside of Sephora, right?"" It was odd cause I never hinted to doing anything of the sort, but after she said that, clients started asking me about it, so I'm pretty sure I'm going to do that. :) Yay makeup for a living! 

Oh also...I don't know if you usually do other people's makeup but as someone who only practiced on themselves, doing makeup on other people is hard. Specifically eyeshadows and liners. And mascara. For SOME reason I can't put mascara on people cause their lashes just don't curl up. Maybe it's cause I'm too short...I have no clue. Aaaannnyway....yeah. Practice on your friends. A lot. And yourself. Practice, practice, practice!!

I can't think of anything else really, but if you have any other questions feel free to ask!"

Drunken mistake with the guy I was dating at the time. He was going to be fully supportive no matter what my decision was (and left it fully up to me, which I appreciated).

I got an abortion because I am nowhere near the point in my life that I can care for another human being. I mean, I have at least a week's worth of dishes piled in my sink and purposely own a month's worth of socks and underwear because I loathe doing laundry. Besides that, I'm dealing with undiagnosed depression and a drinking problem I won't admit to. I am barely capable of taking care of myself, let alone being fully responsible for a very small, very vulnerable human being.

I knew I was going to get an abortion as I was peeing on the stick. I knew I was going to get an abortion when I was purchasing said stick to pee on. I knew I was going to get an abortion when I realized I hadn't had my usually-timed cramps that indicated my period was on it's way.

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1388941922.0,"To illustrate, if there were a prophesy about Batman that read:

&gt;He will come from the north, and will arrive underground, with his head ablaze.  He will smite the joker once and for all.

Well, perhaps I fancy myself to be Batman.  I or my followers could interpret ""come from the north"" to mean being born north of NYC, and ""head ablaze"" to mean having read hair.  And I could intentionally arrive underground through the subway to fulfill the prophesy, or in the absence of information about how I got to NYC my followers could simply assume I took the subway after-the-fact.

But if I arrive and get killed by the Joker and say ""I'll come back and get him next time"", I've missed the important bit.  I've fulfilled a bunch of unimportant stuff, or made it easy to think that I have.  But if I don't fulfill the big bit about defeating joker, there's no serious reason to think I'm batman.  All I've done is do inconsequential things, and create for myself an ""out"" where I don't do the important stuff.

Actually, for Christianity I'd argue there's another step, where things that aren't messianic prophesies at all are claimed to be, so that Jesus fulfills them.

Every relationship is different and the key to good relationships is communication. Only you know whether you want this to work out or not. You'll have to speak all these feelings to her and see what you can work out from there. 

I tend to be a bit more forgiving of people than it seems like people on reddit are, so my only advice is this, if you DO decide to continue the relationship, that's going to mean ultimately letting go of this incident if you truly want things to work. You can be mad now, and you can *be* mad for a while, but you can't hold it over her head and manipulate your future with it. If you do, then you're doomed (at least in my opinion) 

Try and decide for yourself if you believe that she is committed after this incident, and see if you can picture yourself forgiving, if not now, some time down the road. if you cannot, then you should definitely end it, but if you think you could, then continuing shouldn't really be so unimaginable."

ballookey,Cumberbitches,1388943415.0,"What he says is ""I calculated there were 13 possibilities once I'd invited Moriarty onto the roof.""

And then he starts quickly itemizing and *dismissing* the possibilities.

What he was laying out for John was different from what he told Anderson. What he was itemizing for John were not 13 carefully planned scenarios with code-words: they weren't even worthy of getting to that stage because he was dismissing them as useless until he arrived at the workable solution.

What he was describing to John was more akin to the mental process seen in *Scandal in Belgravia* where he's looking over the dead German in the boot of the car. Lestrade says ""Any ideas?"" and Sherlock responds ""Eight, so far…"" but then clearly begins mentally dismissing possibilities. 

In fact just yesterday I saw something that made me realize the whole airbag routine *was* overly complicated. We've seen a far simpler solution in older television and movies dozens of times: [a life net](http://api.ning.com/files/KX2QFl4w19t-*-LlkENzp5SkyiwuCrSDtxuOQmo38rNgcvdjxu9mbMKL4o0c0xDxsiwvvjDr8GeU9x*jruUVaw__/life_net.jpg). They've been known to work for heights greater than six stories, and I think it's more plausible that Sherlock could get ahold of and deploy something like this in the limited time constraints of the situation. This is something that while not commonly used anymore, could quite plausibly be sitting around amongst the EMT equipment at St. Barts.

Using a life net would make the swap go much more quickly: He jumps, lands, is dumped out on the pavement, squash ball in the armpit (or the doppelgänger cadaver is deployed), the net is chucked in the back of the departing rubbish truck, and that's it. 

As for the question of whether or not Sherlock and Mycroft were colluding all along to dismantle Moriarty's network…I think this might have been at the heart of the reason they weren't on speaking terms when Mycroft summoned Watson to the Diogenes Club. It may be that working together was proposed, but for some reason the siblings did not come to an agreement. I think they were perhaps working independently to dismantle Moriarty, maybe it became an inflated sibling rivalry (much like the scene making deductions from the knitted cap)."

But I'm pretty sure there are a not insignificant amount of people that are turned off by a large list of former partners. There are plenty gays that are pretty conservative and others, like myself, that don't consider themselves a homogenous part of ""the community"".

* [Don't Break the Chain](http://dontbreakthechain.com/) - There's something oddly satisfying about this. It really works for me. 
* [Get Ye Done](http://getyedone.com/) - This website is awesome for task-based projects. It turns the stuff you have to do into a quest log and you level up and earn experience points for completing stuff. 
* [Google Tasks](https://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks//) - I use it with Google Calendar.
* [Stay Focused](http://stayfocusd.com) - A web extension that forces you to stay off of certain websites in a very customizable manner. You can always say that you're only going to spend one hour on Reddit a day, but this extension makes you follow your own rules.

waitingforjune,acappella,1388944293.0,"As an a cappella producer myself, as well as someone who has gone the routes of both DIY recording and studio recording for my group's albums, I can tell you that recording yourself is a great way to save time and money if you have someone in your group that has the know-how and the patience to manage the process! For my alma mater group's (RIT Eight Beat Measure) second contemporary album and subsequent singles, we just happened to have access to a phenomenal studio run by a fellow alum (Sled Dog Studios/The Vocal Company), but for our first contemporary album (2010's No Safety Nets), we did all of the recording ourselves in our MD's on-campus apartment. We then sent our tracks off to a specialized editor (Danny Ozment), who sent the tracks to our mix engineer (Ed Boyer). As far as scheduling recording, our MD had a spreadsheet with available times, and people signed up for slots, with make-up times being available in case things popped up (as they often do in college).

In my experience as a producer, I have been the one handling recording, editing, and mixing on all of the projects I have done up to this point. That has just happened to be the case because of the relationships I have had with the groups that I have produced, but it is very common for each task to be handled by a different person or even multiple different people. My alma mater's most recent album (2012's Heatin' Up) was edited by Ted Trembinski of The Vocal Company, but was mixed by a number of different producers, each chosen for a track based on their strong points and style preferences as mixers. In my opinion, that is the way to go (and is becoming very common; the Richmond Octaves most recent album is another great example of that). If you can record yourself, I highly recommend finding a dedicated editor (Danny Ozment, the guys at Plaid Productions, and Ted Trembinski are some of the best; I would also be remiss if I didn't recommend myself ;-) ), and research the works of different mix engineers to see whose sound fits the tracks that you want to make. If it happens that James is the best fit for all of them (or even just makes the most sense fiscally, it depends what your goals are), then that is great too, but while Gammon is brilliant (I had the good fortune to study under him a bit at a Next Level seminar), it never hurts to research the many talented mix engineers in our community.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to PM me, or I'm sure James or Danny would able to offer some great insight as well!"

Sure, you won't be best friends with all of them, but they're all women you can go to when you need a friend, support, love away from home, comfort, help, a study buddy, etc. My recommendation to you going into recruitment is to take the idea that you would be good in that one house out of your head. Going in biased is really a disadvantage to you. Go in open minded, and see for yourself what makes each house the way it is. Also, when it comes to big-little stuff, every person's relationship is different. Some girls' bigs are their party buddies, others are their best friends, while some are more mentors. Because one girl has a certain relationship with her big and you have another, doesn't mean your relationship is worth any less. And you say this girl will be the perfect fit as your big, but you don't know for sure because you haven't met all the other women in the Greek system.

I'm not giving my stance on it. I'm looking at the historical evidence, which clearly indicates that a first century Jew would be against beastiality and homosexual practices.

&gt; Bullshit. **Everything** Jesus said and taught had already been said and taught.

Not accurate. He didn't simply just emphasize it like you said, he radically reformed previous issues. The act of adultery isn't just adultery, so is lust. With anger you have committed murder in your heart, Turn the other cheek etc... 

&gt; If homosexuality was an important issue as adultery, he would have spoken it.

I would think that pedophilia is an important issue, but He didn't speak on that one either.

&gt; I disagree. Even the Torah itself was edited and revised by at least 4 other people

[Citation Needed]

&gt; I'm pretty sure that he would have talked about homosexuality if it was important. Mainly because it was something quite common in the Roman Empire.

Jesus's original mission was to preach to ""the lost sheep"" of Israel, who all agreed homosexuality was bad. However, after his death, Paul and the disciples went out and followed the Great Commission of making disciples out of **all** nations. That's when Paul carried on Christ's ministry, divinely inspired by the the Spirit of Truth (Holy Spirit), which spoke on God's behalf. 

&gt; (Paul's letters) are not anti-homosexuality. The only thing he talks about is prostitutes and brothels

Again, not accurate. Read 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and 1 Timothy 1:8-11. It is very clearly anti-homosexuality

Lastly, you still did not counter any of my other points of Christ doing the will of His Father, who clearly disagreed with Homosexual practices. Nor did you counter my point of Matthew 19."

lost2darkness,premed,1388944646.0,"Scribing can vary a lot. Where I worked, at an urgent care, we had 4 hour shifts. If you're at an ER you may be working very odd hours. 

&gt; Would it be more beneficial to work as a scribe during the summer and focus more on my studies, extracurriculars, and possibly research during the school year?

This really comes down to what is best for *you*. Starting med school debt-free would probably be very helpful. I don't know much well you'd be compensated as a scribe, but I usually got around 8 hours of work (during the school year) and got paid just above minimum wage where I live ($8.50/hr). Most scribe programs also make you stay for a whole year because there is a bit of an investment for them in training and such. You can't really just work one summer's worth. 

If you have *NO* other clinical experience, you may want to look into it. Having clinical experience either through volunteer, work or shadowing is crucial to understanding medicine and getting accepted to medical school. I spent hundreds of hours doing unpaid work in medical settings, in addition to my scribe work, but I did not have to earn money to support myself through college.

If you find a simple word that oppressive and anger inducing in informal speech then I apologize, but seriously don't give it that much power or meaning and you won't have to snap back at people who believe that words only have as much power as you give them. Also I'm pretty sure you just used ""white cis-dude"" in a derogatory or demeaning way while in the same thread trying to call for the end of some offense that some people find in gendered pronouns. How are you going to expect someone to give serious contemplation or thought to joining your cause when you lash out so extremely to comments that aren't offensive. The attitude you've shown and expressed with such vitriolic intent is detrimental to your cause and the same would be said to anyone who spoke the way you did while trying to call attention to a social problem.

For one, the analog sticks have a lot of latency.

Second, they aren't that quick. When I'm in Forza or GTA, if I slam the stick all the way to the side, it takes quite a while for the car to turn to full lock.

Third, they aren't that precise.  While they are analog, they have a VERY short throw, maybe like half an inch.  They're trying to emulate a steering wheel which has about 270 degrees of rotation.  Plus, most games do this ""speed sensitive steering"" shit where they won't let you turn as sharply as you go faster.

In the end, rather than using a stick like you would a normal joystick and move it in small increments, you end up just slamming it all the way left or right in brief movements, effectively treating it like a digital pad or keyboard.

Let me give you another example: have you ever tried playing a SNES or NES emulator using an Xbox controller?  They absolutely suck for it!  The latency becomes incredibly noticeable, along with the lack of precision.  That's another instance where I had better luck using a keyboard."

DivineIntervention,malefashionadvice,1388945410.0,"*I missed the last GD after NYE because of the recovery process but I'd like to share my experience now since I don't typically post on MFA GDs and I'd like to get stuff off my chest with people who aren't my really close friends or whom I can't really tell*:

I went to a show with some friends in Miami last weekend and met some really awesome people. This girl I met there through a couple friends was flirting with me but I didn't really catch on until it was almost too late. We ended up talking every day after until we got to hang out again at our mutual friend's NYE party. It's a beautiful lake house and we ended up having a lot of people drinking and rolling so things got quite rowdy. 

Anyways things kind of escalated quickly with this girl and, before we knew it, several hours had passed and we were together for almost all of it. That following morning I had to leave town which was a little sad for both of us, but she said she wanted to visit me soon and I was kind of taken aback by the gesture. We've been talking consistently since and I'm not really quite sure what to make of it I guess. I don't really know where it's going and I'm really trying hard to keep it off my mind. 

I think it's just catching me off guard right now because of the comedown from the drugs and the fact that I'm normally more apathetic about these things and I haven't felt so strangely in a while. On another note, suspenders are a great NYE accessory IMO. They're just wacky enough to be appropriate for NYE, they're different, and they're something great for women to pull on!

DinoChick,crossfit,1388945414.0,"In my opinion paleo shouldn't be a strict set of rules but rather broad guidelines that you tailor to your specific body. I started with a Whole 30 challenge and stuck with it pure for about two weeks before altering it. Dairy isn't paleo because many people have a sensitivity to it. If you don't then go ahead and drink milk. I kept hard cheese because it doesn't bother me. I eat some rice as well because I feel better with a bit of grain in my diet and I eat a bit of wheat every once and awhile because I don't want to get a sensitivity to it. Is my diet strictly paleo? No. But I follow the basic guidelines (no sugar, no processed, no crap, low grain) with a few modifications my body can handle.

The good thing about beginning Whole 30 was that it gave me a baseline to work from so when I added back in cheese I was able to see what effect it had. I added things in one at a time and was able to see what made me feel like crap and what made me feel better/didn't change."

PlushieChomby,childfree,1388945464.0,"Two years ago, I helped a friend plan and execute her childfree wedding, which meant a great deal of looking up proper etiquette for not offending those attending who had children. You didn't ask for advice, but in case someone else reads this who's considering pointers for the future, I thought I'd share a few things I found worked well. :) 

* Before even sending out the invitations, we called the parents who were likely to attend and informed them it would be an ""Adults Only"" event, but that we could give them the names of highly recommended local babysitters if they'd like. Two took me up on the offer; I don't recall how many took her up on the offer. 

* When creating the invitations, she put, ""Adults Only Ceremony and Reception"" on the actual invitation, followed by, ""We have reserved (number of) seats in your honor"" on the actual RSVP cards. You'd think it would be common sense that only the people whose names are on the envelope are invited (like, ""Guy Name and Girl Name"" rather than ""The Whatever Family"") but unfortunately common sense when it comes to good manners isn't so common anymore. At first she was going to put, ""No Children Please"" on the invitations, but we found a few articles on etiquette sites talking about how good etiquette would be to include a positive rather than a negative (like the ""Adults Only"" blah blah she chose instead of ""No Children Please""). 

* Despite all our research and planning and calling those with kids to let them know no children would be at the wedding, people had the gall to *write in extra seats and children's names* on four of the invitations they returned. Some people are unbelievable. They were all good friends or family members of hers, so I was the one to give them a call (because there's no chance I'd cave and she was afraid she might) and let them know politely but in no uncertain terms that unfortunately (for them) no children were going to be at the wedding as it was an adult-oriented event, and offered the names and numbers of babysitters we'd vetted again. I got bitched out and hung up on twice by falsely entitled parents, and the other two actually apologized and told me they just assumed their children would be exceptions ""because (friend) knows them so well blah blah blah."" By the end of our conversation, they clearly understood there were *no* exceptions, and had agreed to find alternate arrangements for their offspring. 

* Despite the best laid plans, some people love being the turd in the punch bowl. One of the women who bitched me out actually showed up with her 3 kids anyway, in spite of the phone calls and reservations. The audacity of some people, right? So my friend's brother-in-law, who wanted to help but wasn't ""big on this wedding crap"" had been appointed as the official front door baby bouncer, and while I didn't have to deal with the woman myself, I got to watch him tell her, ""Listen lady, even *my* kids aren't here and I'm fuckin' *family*. If there was going to be an exception, it'd be us, but it sure as hell isn't you!"" He was brasher than I'd have hoped anyone would be on her wedding day, but neither bride nor groom witnessed the exchange or even heard of it until well after the wedding was over, and after their somewhat heated exchange, the woman left in a huff. 

The end result was an incredibly beautiful ceremony and a reception that was a blast. No babies crying, no children talking or running up and down the aisles, no kids poking the cake or fighting in the middle of the room, no one tripping over small kids while getting down on the dance floor, no spawn sneezing onto the dessert tables or wiping their boogers everywhere or taking the cameras from the tables and using all the pictures by taking shots of the floor, doorframes, people's feet... All stuff I've endured at other weddings throughout the years, and it was an awesome experience for everyone there. One set of parents I'd had to call actually sought me out to tell me how much fun they were having without any kids there and how long it'd been since they'd had any sort of real date devoid of children. Overall pretty marvelous. 

As for the woman who threw a temper tantrum twice and tried to bring her children anyway, she and my old friend stopped talking after that, which was far from the worst thing in the world, considering what kind of person the woman was. If someone won't even respect your wishes on *your big day* and tries to make it about themselves, it's highly unlikely they're worth knowing. 

Anyway, best of luck with your big day and I sincerely hope no ruiners show up! :D 

Edit: I also went to a wedding five years ago where the bride and groom wisely chose to have it at a vineyard. On the invitations they put ""Ages 21 and Up Only"" or something like that, and their choice of venue made the explanation super easy. If I ever get married, I'll probably go that route myself. "

He also defended the killing of apostates and the massacres in Sudan, under some kind of ""they shouldn't try to secede/might makes right"" argument. He himself had no problem drinking beer, playing the field, not praying and never going to the mosk though. In many ways, he was westernized. He said the first thing he learned, living in Europe, which he had been doing for the last 10 years or so, was not to punch people he disagreed with/felt insulted by.

DingoScallion,AskReddit,1388946151.0,"My junior year in high school I brought a girl from math class to my house. She had the hugest tits and I really liked tits back then and always wanted to see what they looked like. She'd flirted with me all school year too so I just asked her to come over. She came to my house around 3 or so which is bad because my dad comes home from work around 4:30. We spent like an hour watching mtv in my room because she was nervous I suppose. 

With time running out I just kissed her and took her clothes off. I laid her on my bed on her back spread her legs and her pussy didn't smell the best. It smelt like she had just got through fucking the night before and hadn't washed herself yet. It had sort of a musk to it. But I was already in the situation so I just stuck my dick in and rode it out. As I was fucking her and regretting it I realized that her tits weren't that great and that her pussy wasn't that tight. So ashamed and running out of time I quickly came. She thinking I was a virgin tried to comfort me.

I not wanting her to catch on to me regretting the situation kind of egged it on. I said things like ""Aawww.. come on... don't go... Just-just.."" She comforted me and told me that she would call me. As she left my house to get in a car with her brother who drove her her in the first place my dad pulled up. "

Not_Han_Solo,AskMen,1388946157.0,"Well, fuck.

My brother and mother are both CCRNs, so I can actually talk about a lot of this.  Burnout is a very real phenomenon among nurses of all stripes, and its causes are myriad.  12 hour days are a frequent source; while many love the 3 on 4 off schedule, plenty of others simply can't handle the super-long days.  More common is the constant pressure of being responsible, on a daily basis, for the very survival of a number of other human beings.  If I knew his specialty, I could speak more specifically here, but the certain knowledge that any one of your daily activities, at the wrong moment or in the wrong way, can be an inescapable source of stress for some.  It could simply be that he's a guy; while men are nterring nursing more and more, it's still very much a woman's world right now, and if he's the only guy on his floor, trying to fit in could be a really major problem.

But it may well be that his job is only exacerbating the underlying causes of his depression.  For instance, I have a job that I love, but it pays me very, very little.  As a result, I'm constantly cash-strapped and stressed; my job seems to be the proximal cause, but it's only the more obvious suspect, not the real one.  My problem has many solutions which has nothing to do with me getting a new job.  Your boyfriend's situation may be similar.

Figure out, with him, what he loves.  What makes him feel good, strong, smart, worthwhile.  Those are his touchstones, the bases around which he can build a recovery.  Then find the sources of his sadness.  Work to mitigate or minimize them.

Depression is indeed a chemical imbalance in the brain, but you need to remember that it's a persistent chemical state brought on by persistent environmental factors.  Your brain behaves in a certain way when you feel down; depression is simply the result of what happens when your brain becomes accustomed to that norm, and emits hormones and such as though it were the way things were supposed to be.  Recovering from depressions demands that a new norm be established again."

Carpathicus,soccer,1388946168.0,"I guess the thing is that it was already a sealed deal.

Now big club b gets information about that (which is hardly that unusual on the highest tier) and offers 6m. this could lead to a negotiation environment that is financially toxic for the clubs. This isnt about hoeness - its the bro code of big clubs.

*  Doomhammer (I usually find 2x stormforged axe is enough)
*  Wild pyromancer (dangerous to use with totems/feral spirit)

In their place i would consider the following:

*  2nd earthshock 
*  2nd forked lightning
*  2nd flametongue totem
*  2nd Lightning storm
*  2nd Lava burst
*  Defender of argus (high priority due to Feral Spirit and Totems)
*  2nd Earth elemental (maybe to replace sun-walker)
*  Azure Drake

Shaman removal can be crazy strong especially with spell power totems and minions on the board and I feel like your deck doesn't really utilize that.

Also, if you can afford them, Ragnaros and Malygos usually fit pretty well with shaman decks."

PlushieChomby,childfree,1388947260.0,"Sure, there's a way. Change your mind. Unfortunately if you're sure about being childfree, it'd be a miracle if that worked. 

If you stay, you're a step-mom. If you're a step-mom who doesn't parent, you suck at being a step-mom and eventually it'll effect both the child and your boyfriend *far* more than it does now. No one deserves to feel like one of their parents doesn't love or want them, after all, and no matter how much you try to hide it, if that's really how you feel, the kid will pick up on it as he gets older. 

That said, there's nothing wrong with changing your mind and deciding that while you personally don't want to have kids, you're willing to be the best parent to the one in your life that you can be. Provided you can actually do it, of course. If it's something you don't think you can do, the relationship has zero staying power and you should end it. I know how impossible that might sound to you right now, but please know that going that route means temporary suffering followed by genuine shots at long-term happiness for everyone involved. 

If you *want* to change your mind and step up to the challenge by becoming the best step-mom you can be but you just don't know how to do that, I can't recommend therapy highly enough. A good counselor will work through things with you, everything from why you feel the way you feel to how you can be there more for both your boyfriend and his son to whether or not you're truly happy trying to do so or would be better off separating. No stranger on the internet is going to be able to tell you those things, because none of us will know the intricate details of your situation. 

Small pointers? Rather than leaving the house or holing up in another room when the kid is there, spend time *with* him. Do things with him, do things with him and your boyfriend, be an active part of his life to whatever extent possible, and spend some time after he's left by reflecting how you honestly felt about everything that happened with yourself. Don't think of what *could* be or what you think *will* be, just think of what *was* and listen to your instincts. Are things getting better? Are you starting to like being around him? Are you just humouring him? Can you even put in the effort? Is this too tiring? It shouldn't take more than a few weeks or months before you've fully formed a truly clear picture on whether you feel the situation is actually worth sticking around for because you know you not only *can* change but *are* changing, or whether you feel you'd rather go back to holing up or leaving the house - which is a heavy indication that you should end the relationship and give all parties a better chance at finding not just what they want in life, but what they *need*. 

Best of luck to you however things go, and I sincerely hope you find happiness, whether in your current situation or by leaving it. "

The fact is that prior to the sexual liberalization of women, waiting until marriage was pretty much the standard and even if a women didn't wait until marriage she only had maybe one or two partners before getting married. Compare that to some of my female friends who are pushing 30-40 partners. The stigma of sleeping around especially as a women has decreased alot. Modern inventions like birth control have also decreased the potential drawbacks of causal sex significantly. Back in the day, pregnancy out of wedlock was a life destroying event that gave you an ultimatum of get married or get shunned.

Trying to silence that is a goal for people who have a vested interest in maintaining religious thought control for whatever reason.

Demanding people respect their beliefs is code for *other people not being allowed to challenge theists on what they are doing*.

It depends on what the veneer is. Teak is different from oak and so forth.

A first shot is to scrub lightly with mild detergent and see if the crap comes off. 

If it is a round stain and is black like ink, it is frequently seen on oak veneer and as a result of iron oxides in the water. That stain needs to be bleached out first. I use a table spoon of oxylic acid (from a pharmacy) in a teacup of hot water and it works well, but is mildly irritating to smell, and toxic to drink. (it is made from rhubarb leaves which is why the leaves are inedible)and biodegradable down the sink.

Once the stain is dealt with, an application of Danish Oil for oiled woodwork is usually the best solution.

If the stain is other than black, or it is a scratch, vigorous scrubbing along the grain with Danish Oil and 00 grit steel wool usually cuts down from the surface enough to minimise the stain and refinish the wood.

Avoid getting any of this junk on the surface of the speakers."

There has to be a turning point, where he realizes, ""hey, i need to take life a little more seriously"". For me, i had a friend hire me at a store he managed when i was 20.  I ended up closing the store one day and leaving a giant mess.  The owner wanted to fire me but my friend told him he would talk to me.  

I dont remember what he told me, but i do know the important part was hearing it from a peer, a friend of mine.  After that day i took more seriously, i took school more seriously, it really changed my life.  

You are right to be worried, but hes relatively young and has time to change.  

My wife graduated from college and is having trouble in the job market (shes younger than me).  The nice thing is that i do actually make enough money for us to live very comfortably, but there is still some conflict with us.  Mostly because, while she has no job, shes human and still wants things.  I almost start feeling like shes a kid rather than my wife whenever she wants something and has to ask me to get it for her. 

This is looking ahead into the future, but even if you do make enough money to support the both of you, hows it going to feel knowing that your busting ass all day at work and hes sotting around all day doing whatever it is he does?  Then to make even worse he wants a new playstation... 

My wife isnt lazy, shes actually trying, and it still puts a strain on our marriage.  I think if i knew my wife wasnt trying at all I'd divorce her.

2. I don't see why the psychopath thing has to suggest it's River. The Doctor is alluded to as a psychopath as well, so it makes sense that he seems to be attracted to like-minded women.

3. She said about how the Doctor doesn't like seeing time pass, yes, but we've never been led to believe that River doesn't age. She thought she might even dial her age down gradually to freak people out, not that she would just not age at all. We don't know the method Tasha used; it was probably another form of genetic engineering. Liz Ten didn't age either because her body clock was decelerated and no one considered her being River.

4. The universe has more than one computer. The Papal Mainframe is a ship; CAL is integral to a planet.

5. She died repeatedly because of what the Daleks were doing. They were essentially torturing her to death and then reviving her. They could do that because of their nanocloud technology; we saw what they did with Darla von Karlsen; they could revive her memories whenever necessary.

6. Tasha Lem is a name that flows well. His motive for picking it I don't know, but I seem to recall the claim that we hadn't seen her before.

7. It only came out of nowhere because we've never seen her before. Vastra, Jenny and Strax are friends that came out of nowhere; so was Riddell. Tasha just happens to be another love interest."

Eating plastic, especially if it's in little chewed-off shards, can cause some serious issues as well. You should consider either getting him some healthier chews like antlers, bully sticks, or real bones, or finding another outlet for him. Stuff a Kong for him or train him more often.

&gt;the car with a sledgehammer.

&gt;2. To beat or assault severely: The police arrested the men who &gt;bashed an immigrant in the park.

&gt;3. Informal To criticize (another) harshly, accusatorially, and &gt;threateningly: ""He bashed the . . . government unmercifully over the

&gt;v.intr. Informal

&gt;n.

&gt;1. Informal A heavy, crushing blow.
&gt;2. Slang A celebration; a party.

As you can see, the majority of the definitions, in fact the primary definitions, are as I said.

Additionally, when you use 'bash' as in 'bash religion' in the context of arguments on the internet and in the media, it is not a low grade word at all...frequently used by people who are pretty upset, or giving a good imitation of righteous indignation for very specific purposes of controlling what people think about this topic.

It is naive of you to not realize this machination on the part of people with a vested interest in staying in control. Religion is still dominant, but for how long? Atheism or even just apathesim is growing. People of other, smaller faiths are not content to be bowled over by the 'Big Three' any more. 

The internet, the great leveler, has changed how ideas are communicated, to how many people, and by whom, in such fundamental ways that the traditional methods to maintain dominance do not work anymore, or at least not as well as they once did.

You can usually find that at any pet store or order it online.

After you've cleaned the spot, spend a little extra time per day playing with her over top of it. You might even want to put her food bowl there as well just for a little while. This will get her to associate the spot as part of the living space and no longer a place to potty. Naturally, dogs don't want to eliminate where they live.

Don't take this wrong - a lot of pregnant women swear by shea butter or cocoa butter to keep their skin from getting stretch marks and to help it snap back after having a baby. I know, I know, you aren't a lady, and your stomach wasn't the same size as a pregnant woman's stomach. But if it works for them, maybe it wouldn't hurt to get yourself some cocoa or shea butter and give it a try. The skin will likely snap back in time. I'm 29, I've had 3 babies, and even though I never used anything on my stomach skin, it has managed to snap back pretty well. I have old stretch marks around my navel that have faded to silver (so you can't see 'em), and the skin is a little more sagging than it was pre-kids. But it's tightened back up enough that you can see muscle definition through it (when I have any to see, heh!). So yeah, give it time. The weight loss is still recent enough that your skin is still healing itself. It may never rebound all the way but it should improve to a large extent."

Sometimes the boy/man has difficulty peeing. In some cases, particularly in developing countries, circumcision kills the infant. It goes fine most of the time, but can be devastating when it goes wrong.

Re: replies, same issue on many occasions when I do message a guy. But as a girl, here are a few things that make me not bother to reply -- not because they make you horrible, but because they're just momentary deal breakers: likes/has cats. Wants children. Doesn't like cuddling. Prefers space so much so that he points it out. Lives too far away. Is a lawyer. Is in finance. Graduated from an Ivy. Didn't graduate at all. Seems religious. Mentions not wearing/liking cologne. Doesn't drink coffee. Doesn't like dogs. Gets wasted at least once a week. Shirtless photos. Solo cups in photo. Skankyass chicks draped around him in photos. Veganism. Etc.

Life's too short to deal with personal red flags. Unfortunately some of them can't be much done about :) just comes down to preference/knowing it's not worth the time."

Not having dispensaries over here though, I fully support my guy because I know that he uses his income to pay college tuition and is working towards a degree in political science. He's a genuine person, very intelligent, always kind, and almost always available.  Even if my state worked towards full legalization and dispensaries, I would probably continue to buy from him.

He is definitely not a 'stoner', nor is my roommate who works full time at an animal care center and writes children's books as a hobby.

It is very likely they're violating fair use, as sylvan pointed out, and a C&amp;D letter is a perfectly-legitimate way of telling another party to use your copyrighted material. Cease and decist letters are entirely legal, and because the OP has reason to believe his IP rights have been violated, sending a cease and decist letter is a legal and legitimate--and normal--way of dealing with these things. Sending it *because* you want to intimidate is illegal, yes, but that would not be the justification. The justification would be violating of fair use. The result, the usual one, would be that they would comply rather than go to trial given the expense of trial.

I think you are not paying enough attention to the subtleties of how people use spin to try to adjust public policy. Language, and the distortion of it, is a powerful tool.

Who first decided criticizing religion was bashing? Certainly it wasn't atheists. Taking language, pitching it to certain people in a certain way, is a formidable tool of control.

That you can't or won't see this is troubling. Don't take my word for it, of course. Take some time to watch Fox news, for example. And pair this with reading about propaganda techniques and books about persuasion/sales techniques.

There are reasons why the United States is slipping in education, why vast numbers of people are convinced into voting *against* their personal interests for the sake if rich, corporate profits, why women's reproductive rights are being chipped away.

The use of language, or in this case the *misuse* of language, is key to the sea changes that allow things like Climate Change denial and Teabaggery to flourish.

xm03,Warmachine,1388951013.0,"I remember seeing this a while ago on a forum, none of it was verified but its all good for the rumour mill:


&gt;To start with, I will say that what interactions I've had with the actual guys who work/run the store, they are good guys. I've dealt with plenty of slimeball store owners who treated players like crap, these guys treat everyone pretty well.

&gt;What I do know is that TC's retail store has been playing in the grey area of what I would think would be any sort of acceptable practices to PP since the day they opened.

&gt;For several months after opening, they had zero stock on hand. What would happen is that they would have everything listed as ""In Stock"" on their webstore, and when something got ordered, it got added to that weeks order from the distributor. Basically, they were selling dropshipped goods at 25% off MSRP. So, when someone would come to buy something, they'd say ""oh, lemme go check in the back"" ""nope, but it'll be here next wednesday."" Call me crazy, but doing all your sales through a webstore (even walk-in retail would just be shopping off of an ipad, zero shelves/displays of any product in the store at all.) is nuts. When you're listing everything as ""In Stock"" and it's always a two week wait for product, unless you just managed to come in the day before they did the weekly order, then it was just a week wait, is misleading as hell. They were preselling Colossals for 30% off of MSRP, I have zero clue how many they sold, but if they were doing a ton of sales through the webstore, and someone said ""hey, why did they sell 75 of this one model when they barely make a minimum product order every week"" then that may have been a problem. I don't know what PP's policies are, I know they don't have hard rules on websales like GW and Battlefront do, but I've also never been a retailer of any sort, so I have no clue what would raise eyebrows or not.

&gt;Every ""gaming night"" was a paid-entry tournament once the initial Journeyman League was done. Players got to show up to having 4-8 other players just coming in to play, and boom, gimme $5, it's a tournament. Later on, it became ""unless you're a $20/mo Warmachine Member, you can't play on this half of our tables with our terrain on it."" It's cool to say you run a bunch of tournaments, not so cool when it's kinda forced upon the players. Sure, you could come in an play random games throughout the week, but it wasn't like there was a ""This is Warmahordes Night"", so unless you were setting it up ahead of time with another player, there probably was not going to be anyone to play a pickup game with.

&gt;They talk about how they built and grew the gaming community in Tulsa. Not really. They got people all hyped up about MonPoc. Congrats, the game had already crashed and died in the Tulsa area a year before TC opened their store. Everyone in the world knew what TC is apparently shocked and betrayed to find out, that MonPoc is pretty much on hold for any of several reasons, starting before TC even opened their store. A tiny, tiny bit of reading the PP MonPoc forums would have told them exactly what they needed to know on that score. They got their LCG players to buy into warmahordes, cool, got somewhere in the region of 10-15 new players, awesome. (too many players for their warmahordes tablespace, natch.) Not so awesome was talking trash about other stores in the Tulsa area to the new converts, and using people who had been kicked out of other stores in the Tulsa area to add to the stories. They had a small try at trying to actively steal playerbases from other stores in Tulsa, that got curbstomped by the actual playerbase pretty fast. Their addition to the gaming community in Tulsa was creating drama with new players vis-a-vis other stores, and getting several LCG's off the ground and giving those a solid community, if only at TC's store. Cool. Their other ""flagship product"" was a 3-year-old out of print CCG called Spoils that they had played in the past, and apparently had the only actual stock of boosters and starters of in the world, if online shopping and ebay searching is any indication. Of which they've done a wonderful job of selling ancient stock by having drafts and sealed deck tourneys every single week, apparently owning 20 times more sealed CCG stock of Spoils than the entire internet has for sale.

&gt;The resin bases/wreck markers have been brought up. Not really gonna make any friends in PP that way if you are going to sell them, and sell them in the same webstore category as the PP products with no mention of how these aren't anything related to PP. IP Infringement problems all over the place.

&gt;MonPoc product duplication has come up, and if you go over the TeamCovenant website, all those Tokens/Markers/Etc has dissapeared the in last two days.

&gt;Not only that, but PP is not the only company starting to look over to them with a scowl. TC has been registering all sorts of Twitter names like ""@StarWarsLCG"" and ""@NetRunnerLCG"", very official-looking stuff, and using them to hand off Team Convenant news, and retweeting FF news in there, replying to tweets, etc. It creates this hazy line of who is who, especially when I see tweets to them from people nowhere near Tulsa, obviously mistaken in who is running the account. I noticed today when pulling these accounts up while writing this that suddenly there is a lot more Team Covenant in the profiles and descriptions from yesterday.

&gt;The sob story video pretty much exactly what I figured it was going to be when I watched it, a way to rile up the playerbase and create threads exactly like this one. The funny thing is how they do it a month or so after the news of what happened has already made it around the Tulsa scene.

&gt;Anyway, lots of fingerpointing, but not much in the way of hard reasons that are in the public arena of why PP has done what it has, but I really doubt they just threw a dart at a list of stores with their product for the ""(censored) Those Guys"" day of the month.

Go to the hardware store and buy a space heater or two for the rooms you most commonly use. We use one in the bedroom and I have one that goes back and forth between my office and the bathroom. They're like $40 each, which is way cheaper than any of the other options outlined.

Tell the landlord that you absolutely will NOT sign another year-long lease as long as the heating doesn't work. He will not have an easy time finding new tenants as long as it doesn't work either, so propose to him that you go ""month-to-month"" until the heating is repaired. Agree to give him one month's notice if you should decide to move out.

Legally he MUST fix the heating, so if he can't because of funds, he should find this to be a workable compromise.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,pics,1388951691.0,"Originally, a double-exposure was done on actual film. You know...like Kodak film? You open the shutter and ""expose"" the film to light twice on the same frame inside the camera. You get two images layered on top of one another as a result. You could of course do this in a digital camera too theoretically, but not many of them offer the option, so people use photoshop tricks to acheive the effect in the digital realm. To stay true to the original definition of double-exposure though, the composition of the photograph happens in the camera. It makes sense that traditional photographers who sill work in the film medium would not want their skills depreciated.

While there are multiple ways of achieving this end result (whether it be in the film development process or a variety of software tools in the digital world), people are assuming that OP used layer masks in Photoshop to create the piece and therefore saying it's not ""double-exposure"". Calling OP's work double-exposure in this case is like ordering a frozen pizza, cooking it, and then telling everyone you made it from scratch. No matter how OP created the image, I must agree that double-exposure is one thing and 'shopping two images together is another.

My husband is really into mountain biking so moving from a city has been great for him in that respect. I struggle with finding things to do though. We live in a seaside town where there has been a drain on young people which was made worse by the economy recently. There isn't a lot going on for younger people other than going to the pub but with having a toddler this isn't much an option for us. I have family here though so I don't feel completely isolated.

We've both struggled to make new friends due to the above reasons. I think that's what sucks the most about it.

The good points are that I feel safer here, people are generally friendlier, really nice scenery, lower population density. Biggest pro is being able to afford a much higher standard of living. I think given time we can make it more enjoyable here."

I had a guy friend, so I feel for these guys because I think society makes it difficult to share their emotions and whatever so I try to be there for my guy friends because I think they particularly need someone.

Anyway, so my guy friend was having some issues with a girl and he's really shy so I was super patient with him talking about it and giving advice and whatever. And then I start talking about an issue I'm having with a guy and he *fell asleep*. And then the next day acted like nothing happened.

So like, okay it's my fault for exerting so much effort to benefit this guy but needless to say I was done helping him with shit after that. Like it's super clear people just use me for someone to talk to. And they do this all the time, it makes me feel shitty like all they care about is themselves when I am so clearly selfless in these situations.

In this theory, the Jews who became Christians were already in the ""out"" group.  It's not a perfect theory, but I think the Essenes are a much more logical point of origin then any other Jewish group at the time.

redyellowand,answers,1388952517.0,"Yay I work with wool so I actually have an answer to this question!

Structurally, wool is different from cotton--there are little raised hairs or ""barbs"" on the fiber, which allows it to mat or felt (think dreadlocks). I think this is the case for many animal fibers, but since cotton is a vegetable fiber, it behaves a bit differently. Of course, sheep produce lanolin which also prevents felting, but because lanolin is also commercially viable (and hard to work with), producers will separate the lanolin from the wool. 

Superwash wool is chemically treated with a polymer or silicone to protect the fibers when they get wet or washed.

Mercerized wool is separate from superwash, and the process is the same as mercerized cotton--the manufacturers burn off those little barbs so the chance of felting is reduced.

Really, most wool things don't need to be machine washed. Airing them out usually does the trick, or you can use a lanolin-based wool wash. 

As for cotton, I don't really know, but I know cotton can break rather easily and I would imagine washing machines can speed that up with the agitation. "

There's a lot you can do.

Ok, true, you'll never be ""normal."" That doesn't mean that self-improvement isn't a possibility, nor does it mean that you can't learn social skills. 

Having a label means you can look into specific strategies that are recommended for people on the spectrum. It's helpful in sorting through what does and does not work for you, what exactly is going on when you feel overwhelmed, and directions you can go from here.

I live with myself by being the very best me I can possibly be. Yes, it can be extremely frustrating sometimes. Sometimes it's depressing, and sometimes I get extremely hurt. However, I am always learning new things, working on my social skills, and managing my triggers. I've gotten a handle on what I can do and what I can't, and how I can work on the things I can't do, and what I should just avoid.

Did you ever think about if you both really love each other or more the concept of love? Listening to your story I wonder why she was so open and concerned about everything yet didnt do anything about it. Maybe she wanted you to react? Maybe she wanted you to show her true affection which basically means jealousy. And you... trusting her even though she TELLS you that your ""mutual friend"" is hitting on her nonstop. I can tell you one thing: If you want to be a good partner who doesnt cheat you will AVOID situations like this because we are humans and sexual beings and it can get really really hard to stop approaches by others if they constantly occur.

The only thing that changes is the person you do it with, general social attitude, and in cases like yours, your own body. 

Sure, you can say it's just sex. But sex drives are a massive part of our lives, and you're going to spend the rest of your life in your body. If you've got a serious issue with it, as in identifying as a lesbian, then you might as well make the best of it.

Of course, it could just be a fantasy that's spiralled out of control a bit, like people with fetishes who can only get off to one thing. I'd recommend therapy in that case.

Furthermore most passive aggressive men act that way sparingly, they are almost impossible to pick out of a crowd. There are a lot of passive aggressive women who seem to be incapable of turning it off, they just seem to exude it. What I want to know is how that's possible, how those people think as the subtle differences that can cause different behavior patterns and personalities are important. I learned typical body language (long story short there are two different non-verbal languages, most people speak one and are nearly incapable of seeing the other while the people who speak the same one that I do need to learn to read and emulate the other) when I was maybe six or seven. I'm not trying to read people I'm trying to understand how their minds work so that I can control situations, if I can control a situation then it's more likely to stay calm (then again my control a situation is simply subtly manipulating people to keep them from conflicting unnecessarily). Personally I'd prefer to be able to figure out how to filter people out so that I don't need to try to keep things calm but that's unlikely, almost every attempt has failed miserably.

Malsententia,BerryTubeLounge,1388953145.0,"The original concept: http://mixthatdrink.com/skittles-vodka-tutorial/

First tried this a few years back using just skittles and vodka, like the tutorial. Of course, as one might expect, just about any candy will work, though some may require more filtering than others.

However, I did it somewhat differently. Rather than just let skittles disolve into the water of the vodka, I bought everclear. Along with 100% cranberry juice, 100% mixed berry juice, and such. I then bought a ton of warheads and ""Dark side"" skittles, sorted em all out by flavor, and then putt various mixes into 3-4ish ounces of the juice, aiming to strike a good balance of flavor while aiming for pont-ish colors(pinkie pie came out kinda orange, twilight came out more reddish than I intended), heated it some till they disolved. The result was a rather thick syrupy solution. I then mixed this in various ratios with the everclear, then ran through a coffee filter to get most of the undisolvable bits of candy out. The result, in the case of ""Twilight Sparkle"", is something with roughly the alcohol content of your average liquor(80 proof), but with a crazy delicious mix of pomegranate, cherry, and cranberry flavoring.

Nightmare moon I made stronger, and sour-er. Buncha black cherry warheads, berry skittles, berry juice, and 100-120ish proof. Also I disolved in a dash of caffeine powder. She's an psycho evil alicorn goddess. Comes out to about 1/4 cup of coffee per shot, prolly less. 

Rarity I made a bit stronger, with the mix of stuff seen above.

Pinkie pie also had caffeine as well, and the flavors seen above. 

These were all pretty experimental. I'd done it before with jolly ranchers and such, and warheads waay back. But this was the first time doing it with berry juices and a mix of warheads and skittles. I think Twilight was my biggest success.

What I'd really really like to try to do next time I get a chance to do this, is to actually use actual berries. Being in the middle of winter up here I didn't really look into it, but once they're in season, good times gonna come.

What’s even more impressive is that we reached this goal while Cloud Imperium was closed for the holidays, without any kind of special “holiday” promotion – pretty staggering and it’s entirely down to the word of mouth and enthusiasm from all of you!

I’m happy to report that the Star Citizen Development team will be back on the job as of Monday, revitalized and with an ever-greater determination to do everything to make this the Best Damn Space Sim Ever. Your continued financial support allows us to chase this goal with confidence.

Starting on Monday, I’ll be sitting down with the Dogfighting Module team to go over all your feedback from our live demo at the end of the year and schedule the remaining functionality, content and polish we want to achieve before we push it out to all of your hard drives!

After this I’ll be making my first visits to our new offices in Manchester and then Austin, where we are holding a summit with all the teams from around the world working on Star Citizen to schedule and coordinate this year’s work in detail.

Last but not least, launching The Next Great Starship, exposing some great talent to the community and allowing you to see the process of building ships up close for Star Citizen!

I can’t wait to get back to work!

At $36 million, you’ve unlocked the first of the backer-voted systems, Tamsa:

* Tamsa System – Located near the fringe of Banu space, Tamsa System features a massive central star that has collapsed into a black hole. Only two planets remain in the system, a chthonian world and a gas giant located far from the black hole’s event horizon.

For the $38 million goal, your votes have selected the “fully aquatic planet” option. Here’s the description of the system we’re creating based on your input:

* Cano System is home to a G-Type Main Sequence Star that’s almost identical to Earth’s. Of the four planets in the system, only one is inhabited: Carteyna. Located on the edge of habitable zone, Carteyna is a classic waterworld. Fortunately, its planetary axis constantly keeps the northern hemisphere away from the sun, which allowed for the water to freeze into the landmasses used as the initial landing zones in 2587. Multiple attempts have been made to try to convert the thick atmosphere into something breathable, but the process never seemed to stick. In fact, over the years, every time there’s a new technological development in geo-engineering, they test it out here on Carteyna only to yield the same result. Almost fifty years ago, scientists discovered microscopic organisms in the very early phases of life in the depths of the oceans. This caused a massive uproar throughout the UEE at the prospect that they had been attempting to terraform a developing world. Carteyna was immediately placed under the Fair Chance Act. Unfortunately, Humans had been living here for almost over three hundred years and the families that had been here for generations felt that they had earned rights as residents. After years of debate in the political and scientific community, the population was allowed to stay, but only under certain conditions: future terraforming attempts have been outlawed and the Human population has been consolidated to a single arcology to minimize their impact on their environment and the development of whatever species is growing in the deep.
Be sure and vote for the penultimate backer-decided system in the poll located below. Remember, these options just represent a small portion of what the additional budget allows us to do with Star Citizen!

Thank you for your continued support.

In honor of this accomplishment, I’d like to share the result of an aspect of Star Citizen that I think makes us special compared to the normal game development process – involving the community during development to get user feedback early to shape a better game. Here’s the result of a lot Freelancer pilot’s requests now they’ve had some time to get a feel for their ship in the Hangar: a revised design for an updated Freelancer cockpit featuring the greater visibility! And get ready: you’ll be seeing more of the Freelancer in the New Year.

""I would disagree. My wife's grandfather fought in one of the German trained divisions and they definitely didn't run on fumes as their battle record shows. The issue was those German trained divisions were the only reliable divisions the KMT had and they didn't have many of them. The other warlords and such who were pulled into the KMT as an umbrella organization had poorly trained and unreliable troops that often failed to show up or broke quickly when faced with fire from the Japanese.
Prior to the Japanese expanding out of Manchuria, the German divisions were performing extremely well in the civil war. Keep in mind the KMT also had Soviet advisers such as Vasily Bluyker training them. They were gaining experience in multiple doctrines and had a stream of pretty good German equipment prior to Hitler pulling the plug. They even had a bit of an armored corps going on.
The KMT lost most of its crack troops in the war and was left with troops that practically qualified as irregulars and would engage in things like the drug trade. Which is one of the reasons the KMT could barely hold the cities while the CCP took the countryside. The KMT also faced the issue that most of their officers were from the land owning class and thus land reform was problematic unless you wanted the majority of your officer corps to tell you to fuck off and splinter. Beyond that, Mao did a good job of framing the KMT's attrition tactics (such as opting not to defend Shanghai, but instead lure the IJA inland where its supply chain would be stretched) as the KMT failing to fight.
Had the KMT been involved in some kind of outward war where they could rally nationalist sentiment and gain legitimacy from those crack divisions kicking the ass of some, be it the Soviets or weakly defended European colonial holdings, the big issue of land reform is at the very least temporarily suspended. Chiang had numerous successes with things like the blockhouse strategy and the CCP didn't make the Long March because they felt like a vacation. Plus if 'China', that is to say the Republic of China as founded by Sun Yatsen and whatever assets it controls, goes to war with the Soviets with the backing of Hitler, Communism is an enemy of all and China gaining more land. There are significantly more propaganda avenues to attack the CCP.
Ultimately land and economic reform would be a major issue for any regime that wishes to rule China, but the KMT was nowhere close to being on fumes prior to the IJA chewing up their best and brightest. If China had a long term commitment from the German advisers and the 80 divisions the original training plan called for had been brought into service, the KMT would have been an excellent position in terms of projecting power and patching over domestic issues, at least in the short term, with warfare driven nationalism.
The West had been shitting on China for years. If in 1939 the KMT grabs Hong Kong, gets the French to roll over in Vietnam just as they did for Imperial Japan, or some other comparable symbols of success early on, that legitimizes the KMT and buys time before land and economic reform has to happen. You can at least say ""That will be handled post war"" and many folks will be too busy enjoying the fact they're finally sticking it to certain powers to get too worked up about some reforms not occurring right this moment."""

It does mean much because while that is an extreme case, it tells me whether you truly believe your god provides a definition of a moral code or if you just think his rules conveniently line up with your beliefs (which, assuming you were raised muslim, they naturally would).

My argument is that there are plenty of things I could find from pretty much any religious text that say TERRIBLE things. Only extremists actually follow these parts of the texts because most reasonable people don't actually use a book as their absolute definition of morality.

If you were to say your god was the true definition of morality, and that your holy book is the words of your god, then that would necessitate you follow every law and lesson in it."

But the BARTENDER.  Good gravy.  We met up on New Year's Day and the place I'd suggested was closed (WTF St Paul?) so we went to a place across the street.  This neighborhood (we met up in my neck of the woods) is shady as all fuck and this bar was no exception.  Crankiest barkeep I've ever encountered; he was royally offended that a) my date and I both had valid IDs, b) my date asked for a Surly, c) when they didn't have Surly, he asked for a Summit (which he also didn't have -- ""I GOT HEINEKEN, CORONA, OR PACIFICA"") d) I tried to pay with a card (""I CAN'T TAKE THAT! YOU NEED $20 TO CHARGE!"" he bellowed), and e) that I wanted a glass of water with my Heineken.  He actually filled up a glass with water and put it on the OTHER END OF THE BAR so I'd have to trot down and grab it.  In an otherwise completely empty bar.  Happy in your work?

Also, he kept the bottled beer in a locked room with ""NO ADMITTANCE"" plastered on it.  He was the grumpiest dude I've met in a while; I could do nothing but laugh my ass off when he turned his back.  I don't think my date was nearly as impressed as I was at this guy's commitment to being pissed off.

ruat_caelum,arduino,1388955698.0,"Look at weight sensors using [wheatstone bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatstone_bridge) for the amount of beer remaining.

As for displays almost all of them can be controlled serially with one analog out pin and one wire from your main processor.

If you want you can dedicate another AVR chip like the ATTINY85 to do the display and communicate with it via the main chip over 1 or 2 wires and pins (I suggest two because then you have bi directional (though you can do that with one...) communications if you want to use a touch screen for input)

Temp sensors can be tricky. You don't need insane accuracy here though so I always recommend the dallas one wire temp sensors (They use 1 pin serial communication, long lead lines, and easily incorporated with a library.) There is also the TMP36 for analog readings on a single analog input pin. There are also the analog options of building a voltage divider circuit and using and RTD, or a milliamp amp and using thermocouples.

Flow sensors on the hobbiest budget often involve fast counting on an intrupt pin (i.e. the sensor gives out information via hertz.) Some of the more expensive (but still hobbiest price range, do puleses at say 10 mililiters, or 100, etc. These still need an interrupt pin but the additional pulses allow better volumetric flow calcs.

Power loss or power down always causes issues where your ""program"" is keeping tract of data via records. If you had a sensor that recorded weight, you could switch kegs out at any level of beer and the hardware would be able to calculate beer remaining in the new keg etc. (i.e. direct readings are almost always more accurate than derived ones.)

On a side note how true is it that you navy boys just dump the irradiated parts over the side instead of logging and jumping though the disposal hoops? (I'm talking a bolt here and there not I-beams.) Theoretically speaking of course.

*Ninja Edit - The addressable displays? Just display everything on one display and use tabs or pages to cycle through them. or shift registers to push to any display from one or two pins. An input of a 3x4 matric grid (telephone key pad with 0-9 and #*) can be used on one input pin (voltage divider input method.) If you want navigation, or push buttons, or a [touch screen display is easiest but still expensive at 84 us$.](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11741)

**Easy does it.** Everything you have except the flow meters are ""slow"" and "" dumb"" that is they do not need real time updates or expect updates or inputs at certain intervals, nor do they give input back without being asked first. Which means you can run this whole thing off the #of pins required for the flows + 1 (digital out pin) for **ALL** the displays (pushed though shift-registers) + 1 (digital in&amp;out pin) for **ALL** the temps (assuming one-wire dallas temps) +1 (analog in pin) for **all** the input (assuming 3x4 matrix keypad)"

Seattlelite84,TrueAskReddit,1388955726.0,"m surprised anyone who has done a deal of study on the subjects at hand can actually espouse any form of dictatorial government, in which monarchy (especially the hereditary form) stands firmly rooted.

It seems to me the real questions arise from looking at all the inadequacies of democracy. And yeah, there are a lot of those. After a lot of study and hearing different arguments, I admit I’ve come to think that the democratic institutions in the US are thoroughly borked. Which is kind of inevitable every time the government becomes a business, and public service becomes profitable. Over time, under those conditions, every system will fall into corruption and entrenched toxicity. Any man who seeks power over others is the last person who should wield it.

So to answer the question… I’m opting toward a denial of both, thank you very much.

It seems to me the only form of positive government genuinely representative of the people it governs would have to be a ground-up direct democracies formed of levels of spokes-councils, beginning locally and moving up the chain to a national level, with immediate recall and votes of no confidence sacrosanct. Lateral, non-hierarchal operations, every voice understood as sovereign. /That/ is the only legitimate democracy that deserves the name. Is it tedious, slow, occasionally mind-numbingly aggravating? Yep. But it’s also the only way people genuinely know their voice, their will, actually means a damn, and /that/ is only way to get an actual educated, informed, and eager population turned on to direct participation: to show them their participation is both desired and needed."

Who are we to tell them what to do? It's like child labor, all western countries had kids working in factories in the past and it was a normal thing. Now that we are more prosperous, we've made it illegal and are forcing other countries to outlaw it.

&gt;I guess a related post I have asked another person, not to be argumentative but just to understand how the father-son requirement would work here--how does that reconcile with a virgin birth? (Isaiah 7:14)

There's no reason to think Isaiah 7:14 is about a virgin.  The noun עלמה refers consistently to a young woman.  Never does the context necessitate virginity, and in several cases the woman referred to by the word is explicitly *not* a virgin.  The Hebrew word for ""virgin"" isn't used there."

Not everyone needs to take their skin care seriously. If you are blessed with the kind of skin you can wash and dry and go about your day without needing to use creams and serums, of course you aren't going to listen when someone with different skincare needs tries to convince you that you need a 'real skincare regimen' too. My sister is one of those people. She washes it with some kind of mild cleanser - Spectro Jel, or something? - and then just dries it and leaves the bathroom. She doesn't use any kind of moisturizer. Her skin looks great. I, on the other hand, have devoted years to finding the holy grail of products that will work with my skin because it's fussy and easily irritated, but requires deep moisturizing every single day.

If a woman is skipping a lot of periods that may mean the endometrium is growing a lot without being sloughed during menstruation. That's correlated with an increased chance of endometrial cancer. But, skipping periods while on hormonal BC doesn't have the same risk because the BC is preventing typical endometrial growth.

Stuff that may be relevant to you: Hormonal BC has been associated with a minor reduction in the risk of ovarian and uterine (endometrial) cancer. Some studies associate the pill with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, there is still some debate about this. It's possible to totally skip your period, or have one or two periods a year by skipping the placebo pills in the birth control packs. On the other hand, some women really don't tolerate hormonal BC well, and have annoying to horrible side effects. There are also very rare, but very severe side effect that can occur."

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1388957658.0,"Yeah, it works quite well.  Other similar hypotheses (similar to the latter mostly) is that early Christianity appealed heavily to Hellenistic Jews, many of whom may've been gentiles interested in converting.  It allowed them to have the theology they liked without the difficult laws, which meant they didn't have to separate themselves from Roman society.

However, the obstacle for these is Paul's claim that he was a mega-Pharisee.  Assuming he's telling the truth, it doesn't make any sense because he's not mentioned in anything Jewish.  Him exaggerating his own importance would throw into question his reliability for Christians, but would also not make sense because he's invoking being a former Pharisee to bolster his own authority, but wouldn't make sense if Christians viewed their Jewish roots as non-Pharisaic."

s1295,AskMen,1388957852.0,"My advice having major depressive disorder myself (though he may still be very different, of course):

* Accept the way he feels. When he's not enjoying time with his friends or you, or whatever, don't pressure him into feeling better, in fact, I wouldn't even *try* to make him feel better by ""increasing the fun"" or whatever. I far prefer the attitude ""It's too bad you're not feeling well, but that's okay. I'll just hold you, knowing that that won't fix things, but maybe it'll ease it for the moment.""

* The best thing you can do for him is making sure he's getting the best treatment he can, which should be psychotherapy (talking) or medication or both — depending on which seems most promising for his situation and symptoms. All of this means setting up appointments and actually showing up etc., which can be *really* hard for a variety of reasons. Support him in that in whichever way you can (encouraging alone can make the critical difference).

* Lastly, I guess this is a personal preference, but don't be too in-your-face all day every day. Not ""tell me when you need me"", either: he might not, out of fear of being a burden. Find a middle ground. Or maybe you already know what level of attention he likes. Go with that and display clear intent to help, but don't overdo it."

It's roots are in religious/cultural differences, like every part that was under Islamic regime in the past is considered ""wakf"" or sacred. Islam must regain to its control every wakf lost, so the existence of the Jewish state of Israel (and parts of Iberia, south Italy, Malta and more as non Muslim states) clashes with the Islam faith. That was one example for the misconceptions regarding that conflict.

This makes no sense. People can react how they will based on any stimuli. Some people get off on Pokemon. This is ""thought crime,"" we are asking people to respond only in the way we feel is appropriate. Who are we to demand that of other people? We don't have to *agree* with people's reactions, but how can we denounce them as well?

&gt; Every action we take came either make us better or worse people.

This is slippery slope logic, Western Civilization won't collapse because some lady showed off her ass on Instagram. I can guarantee in six months neither of us will remember this incident or her name.

&gt; Does staring at her make one a better person?

This too is faulty logic, now you are making a moral argument. That somehow she should show her ass, but we should respond like art critics lest society falls apart. Also, no human being goes ""How should I react to this, for the sake of making society better."" That's just silly. You make society better by doing good things, not be refraining from being sexually attracted **like human genes programmed us to be**. You have a problem with that, take it up with evolution and mother nature, not Instagrammers."

mmmsoap,AskWomen,1388957983.0,"The two big ones that tend to go away or lessen as people around me get older (hence I view them as signs of immaturity) are:

1. Every little bump in the raid is a Really Big Deal^TM, and you need to tell everyone about it. You got a flat and were late to work? The guy in front of you in the coffee shop bumped in to you and spilled his coffee? Well, that's a fine cocktail party story, but most people get it fixed, but a new tire, wash their shirt, what have you, and get on with their lives. They don't complain about it on Facebook, or talk about it loudly in the break room, etc. 

2. Not being able to calmly talk about your feelings. Those posts about ""worst day ever"" with no context? Attention seeking. ""(S)he never does Y and we should totally break up""? Silly. Turning relationship issues into drama or throwing the SO under the bus and exposing private relationship concerns to friends and family out of anger/revenge are just spiteful and selfish, immature traits.    Healthy mature people can say ""I'm upset about X"" or ""I'm just cranky today, I'm sorry and I didn't intend to take it out on you"". 

On my experience, as you get older the highs aren't as high, but the lows aren't as low either. Everything sort of smooths out as you get more experience dealing with the normal bumps in the road that come with life. "

I have no idea where you even got that, but I think it must be from some other conversation you had.  He just witnessed people being oh so surprised to see black people speaking normally, and I agree that would be frustrating to witness, especially from someone who was around black people so often in his adolescence that the notion that they would be anything other than normal is ridiculous to him.

You think OP's pretending to be above racism but that nobody actually is? Is that your excuse for being racist?

OP please don't listen to this guy.  You're not a racist and, like I said, the experience you had does sound frustrating.  You were all in an exotic culture and it's expected that you would all be in wonder of certain aspects of it, but the strong ""othering"" of people because of their skin color would be upsetting to witness.

Well yeah. But I think they're aiming their anger at the wrong people.

&gt; I can understand not wanting to be the object of a fetish...I'd rather be with someone who is interested in me and not just turned on by my feet, you know?

As someone with a slightly alarming list of fetishes, I think you have some misconceptions about them. 

I mean, I like sadomasochistically inclined guys, but that doesn't mean I'm some kind of sociopath that can't understand or appreciate or be turned on by anything else about him. I will still love him for his personality, his looks, his mannerisms, et cetera. (This isn't the best example but I'd rather not have to blunder my way through explaining the more fitting but odder ones.) 

It's TOTALLY understandable not wanting to be loved in that *manner*(e.g., with the dude having a larger focus on your feet) and preferring conventional stuff, but it's untrue that the person with the fetish isn't looking at you like a whole human being, like you're a piece of meat.

I will concede that yes, it would probably be very hard to make a relationship with a person with fetishes so absolute that they aren't turned on by anything else. Don't have a problem with that. But that isn't as typical and anyways still doesn't mean they don't see you as a human being- it just doesn't fit with how you want to be loved, which is fine. But that doesn't warrant being *angry* at these people."

The tone is quite snarky, which I don't particularly like in an informative piece, and it was first published a couple of years ago (some sections are marked ""NEW"", but it doesn't give any indication of when the page was last edited). However, the guy makes a lot of compelling points. I'll link to and summarise some specific sections of interest, but it's worth reading the whole thing through.

* **[EU Membership](http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-opinion/4341-a-unionist-lexicon-an-a-z-of-unionist-scare-stories-myths-and-misinformation#eu)** - One of the most talked about points is whether or not Scotland would have to reapply to the EU or not. But, what about the rest of the UK? I hadn't even considered their position in the EU in the event of Scottish secession.
&gt; Let's assume that the EU decides to support Westminster in its epic sulk, and demands that Scotland reapply to join the EU but England-Wales-Northern Ireland remained a member.  This would mean that Scotland is considered an entirely new state.  In that circumstance, international law is very clear that Scotland would not be bound by any of the obligations of the UK.  Amongst other things, that means that Scotland would not be required to take on a single penny of UK national debt.  UK national debt is a UK obligation.  The UK ruined the banks, so the UK can pay for it... Another reason Westminster is blustering on this issue is that the UK was formed by the Union of Scotland and England in 1707.  The state formed by that Union signed the EU membership treaties.  When Scotland becomes independent, then the UK ceases to exist, and England-Wales-Northern-Ireland are in exactly the same legal situation as Scotland, because the state comprising England Wales and Northern Ireland didn't sign the EU accession treaties either.

* **[Spain](http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-opinion/4341-a-unionist-lexicon-an-a-z-of-unionist-scare-stories-myths-and-misinformation#spain)** - Another huge talking point is the comparison of the Scottish independence campaign to the one in Catalonia. TL;DR - Catalonia, the richest part of Spain, (who speak Catalan rather than Castillian Spanish) are sick of oppression by the Spanish government in Madrid. They want to to secede, but Sapin is against this:
&gt; Spanish opposition to Catalan and Basque independence is based on a clause in the Spanish constitution which refers to Spain as one indivisible nation.  The Spanish cited a similar clause in the Serbian constitution when they refused to recognise the independence of Kosovo from Serbia... Unionists are asking us to believe that Spain would veto Scottish membership of the EU in order to discourage Basque and Catalan nationalism, when the Spanish government itself says that the Scottish and Spanish situations have nothing to do with one another.  Then there's Gibraltar, the existence of which means Spanish conservatives aren't naturally disposed to do Westminster any favours on questions of sovereignty.  As a successor state to the UK, Scotland has a share in Gibraltar and we could tell Spain we'd swap it for parts of Benidorm.  
* **[Volatile Oil Price](http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-opinion/4341-a-unionist-lexicon-an-a-z-of-unionist-scare-stories-myths-and-misinformation#volatile)** -
&gt; According to First Minister Alex Salmond, oil revenues make up 15% of the Scottish economy.  Norway's oil revenues make up 24% of the Norwegian economy and 47% of the value of Norwegian exports.  In 2007, oil and gas made up 19.7% of the value of all Canadian exports.  Norway and Canada seem to do just fine even though they are more dependent upon energy exports than Scotland, but then Norway and Canada have the power to invest their oil revenues in order to develop their economies in other ways.  Scotland doesn't have that power, we only get what Westminster chooses to give us... As an aside, it's odd that it's only ever oil which gets factored out as ""special"" in discussions about the economy.  **The much vaunted financial sector of the City of London has an equally volatile contribution to the national economy of the UK.**  In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the financial sector of the City had to be bailed out by the taxpayer to the tune of billions, but if you listen to the Unionist parties you'd get the impression it was a reliable cash cow.  It's never factored out of discussions about the UK economy. No one ever wonders how England would cope without the tax income from the City.  But musings on a Scotland without oil are a staple of Unionist commentary.
* **[Subsidies](http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-opinion/4341-a-unionist-lexicon-an-a-z-of-unionist-scare-stories-myths-and-misinformation#subsidies)** - 
&gt; But if, like me, your eyes glaze over when you hear talk of balance sheets, budgets and the Barnett Formula, just consider that Westminster could very easily make it clear exactly how much Scotland puts into the Union, and exactly how much we get back in return.  After all, it's Westminster which collects all the money and allocates where it goes.  We can assume they know who pays what and who gets what. If Scotland was indeed hopelessly dependent on UK handouts, Westminster would publish all the figures in glorious technicolour and upload videos to YouTube, and there would be a 10 part BBC documentary all about them.  This would pretty much kill the independence debate stone dead, as Scots would be able to quantify those so-called Union benefits in precise detail.  But instead finding out how much Scotland pays into the Union and how much we get back takes a crack squad of industrial strength accountants on amphetamines.  So it's a safe bet that we're not dependent on subsidies from Westminster after all.
* **[Positive Case for the Union](http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-opinion/4341-a-unionist-lexicon-an-a-z-of-unionist-scare-stories-myths-and-misinformation#positive) - This is a longish section, but here's the final two paragraphs:
&gt; There's no sign of a substantive positive case for the Union coming along any time soon, nor indeed, ever coming along at all.  Let's be honest here, if the positive case existed, we'd all know all about it by now.  BBC Scotland, the Scotsman et al. would have been sure to mention it, repeatedly.  It would in fact be given about as much publicity as the London Olympics. *The silence speaks volumes.*
* **[BBC](http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-opinion/4341-a-unionist-lexicon-an-a-z-of-unionist-scare-stories-myths-and-misinformation#bbc)** - An interesting point about BBC expenditure that I was previously unaware of:
&gt; Scotland contributes an annual total of approximately £230 million in licence fees to the BBC.  Yet BBC Scotland has an annual budget of £120 million, an amount which is being cut.  Scotland has 8.6% of the UK population but only receives 3.7 % of the BBC's programme making expenditure.

There are other things of note that are now semi-redundant. One section mentions Scotland not retaining the UK's AAA credit rating. This is amusing considering that [the UK got downgraded](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21554311) in February last year. There was talk of roaming charges for travelling about Britain, however the [EU has announced a decision to scrap roaming charges](http://www.rightmobilephone.co.uk/mobiles/news/22788/eu-to-drop-mobile-phone-roaming-charges/).

#Finally, a serious topic expressed in /r/polandball form: [UK Euroscepticism](http://i.imgur.com/SkELnr2.jpg ""Leaving the Union"").

I am currently undecided on whether I want independence or not, although I am leaning towards a Yes vote. It's a very very important decision, but I don't feel that I've done enough research either way. There is this article, which is good and concise, but is obviously biased towards independence. Similarly, there is the White Paper which the Scottish Government published at the end of November. I haven't yet had a chance to read it, so I can't comment on what it's like, but it is *Obviously* pro independence. I've yet to see anything compelling from the Better Together campaign. 

#I think we could make it.

**EDIT** - Thank you to everyone who responded to me, you've cleared up a lot of points. I think it highlights a major issue though: there are a lot of people who read this who don't have access to this kind of discussion about it.

For example, I'm a 19 year old student studying Computing Science. I haven't yet had the opportunity to vote, so I have next to no experience with Politics. I also have no experience with Economics. Yes, I am naïve, but bear in mind that I'm not alone. There are lots of people out there who don't know much about either, but who aren't doing research to find out what they can. Pieces like this can be very influential, regardless of how true they are."

So for example a rocket launcher only comes with like 5 rockets, or how you can only have 2 add-ons to your gun even though it could IRL fit 4 or 5.

well how about a game where how many people you kill doesnt really matter as much as the fiscal damage you do. Both sides would start with like $500,000,000 instead of lives and they spend that. So sure, you can spawn with a rocket launcher, 500 rockets, heartbeat sensor, .50BMG machine gun, and titanium armor, but you are spending a lot of money, so you damn well better be costing a lot (killing people with expensive equipment).

You could even add other mechanics, like making vehicles or even people cost the team money. Hell if you wanted to get crazy you could make different spawns (spawning at home vs parachuting in) cost different amounts or even make it so a defending team has buildings that cost them money when they are destroyed.

team that reaches $0 first loses."

But Spider-Man fights people that can crush his organs by thinking about it, pick him up and slam him across the room like a ragdoll, incinerate him with lightning, and drain his life force *all the time*. He's a superhero, this is what he's been doing since he was in highschool and he's still around (unless we're talking about SpOck era, in which case he'd be more willing to kill right away but less experienced using his powers). 

I still think Mace Windu would be more likely to resort to killing blows first, which would give him an edge in a fight to the death, but I don't think the force is that much stronger than any of the other many superpowers in the Marvel universe. Using the force always requires concentration, at least in every portrayal of it I've seen and read. Making his enemies lose their concentration by means of witty banter and webs in their eyes is one of Spider-Man's specialties. There are lots of highly skilled bounty hunters in the Star Wars universe without the force that have successfully killed Jedi only using superior equipment and tactics; not having the force doesn't mean someone automatically loses.

If he chose to rip Spider-Man limb from limb as soon as he saw him before he could react, Mace Windu could indeed win in a second. If they start with ""no knowledge of each other"" and ""no bloodlust"" that is not going to happen. If he were fighting Sidious maybe, but not Mace Windu. Mace has enough discipline to not call upon the dark side of the force to kill a foe he knows nothing about and he has enough confidence in his abilities to assume he doesn't need to. They're going to be building up to that final fatal blow. Anyway, I still think Mace has a slight advantage like I said before, but just assuming he wins only because he has the force is way too uncreative for this subreddit in my opinion.

EvanYork,lewronggeneration,1388959134.0,"I think it's in many ways motivated by a subtle sort of racism.  I'm not saying they're all Klan members waiting to lynch Weezy or Kanye, but I believe a lot of opposition to rap is rooted in bias against black culture as a whole.

Can people dislike rap just on a musical basis?  Certainly.  Can a 12 year old?  No, not at all.  In my opinion, most of these people are just way too young to think critically about why they like or dislike something.

I don't want to generalize, of course.  A lot of people really just can't get into it.  But the sort of frothing-at-the-mouth opposition we're talking about is bigger then just hating the music.  It's also about hating on the people who listen to it and the people who make it.  And, since rap is predominately associated with black culture, it's hard to spit venom at rappers and fans of rap music without picking up a little racism along the way."
lazybarista,AskWomen,1388959135.0,"Yes. One of my best friends from college is this ridiculously brilliant girl on the right track towards everything, and she seemed really invested in our friendship despite me mostly being a huge drunken partier at the time. We stayed close over years as she was doing internship after internship really advancing scholastically/professionally as I started to stall. But still, when I was leaving my old city she cried all day and even though we haven't lived in the same city for years we still talk all the time. Now that were in our mid 20s she has a masters degree, an amazing job, and is just everything I wish I could have been while I like, work jobs for high schoolers and have nothing else going on.

She eventually came out to me as lesbian (I had kind of suspected) and I was the first person she felt she could tell. I can't wait to see her again!"
sir_sri,politics,1388959138.0,"That's more or less been Mccains criticism of the handling of the Iraq war actually.

Though he's been generally in favour of the invasion (and he was obviously wrong to have done so, even at the time), he hasn't really had good things to say about how things have been run.  

Besides that, the question is what do you do about it now?   Handing over a large chuck of Iraq and  Syria to Al  Qaeda and affiliated groups is certainly an option, the US has essentially done that in Afghanistan and handed control of the bulk of the country to the Taleban.  But doing nothing  has a fairly long history of coming back to bite you in the ass just as much as doing the wrong thing.  

Demanding the Iraqi's deal with it - assuming they even want to, supposes they are capable, which thus far it appears they are not.  Of course sending in US troops would require the Iraqi's ask for help to make  it legal - there's nothing wrong with pitching them options about what the US government would agree too.  (E.g. We're willing to sell you this collection of weapons, this amount of training, or send this number of troops with equipment, willing to pay this much in bribes etc.).  

I'm not really saying sending in more foreign troops to Iraq is a good idea - in general it isn't.  But if your neighbours house is on fire, yelling at your kid for having thrown cigarette butts into the neighbours yard and starting the fire while he is trying to call the fire department  is not going to get you any closer to solution to the immediate problem.

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1388959385.0,"&gt;I think there are two responses to that. The first is my own simplistic one, which is what sort of a ""sign"" is it that a ""young woman"" would bear a son and call him Immanuel? As opposed to an old woman? A virgin bearing a son, now that's a sign that something special is happening.

First of all, the sign is specifically to the king.  Second, the sign seems to me to be the birth of someone whose life is somehow special--that's how the rest of it reads. [Isaiah 7:10-17].  Third, if that's the sign, you'd think the wording would make it unambiguous.  If that's what the sign is, why not say it outright?  If I said, ""watch, a girl's gonna get pregnant, and the baby's gonna do special things"", you'd assume the special things are why I said ""watch"", not that I meant to imply virginity when I said ""girl"".

&gt;The second response is from more studious people who explain that the reason Christians use that term in our version of the OT is because we have taken that from the Greek translations made 200 years before Christ, in which the Hebrew translators translated the term into ""virgin"" and not ""maiden"" or ""young woman."" So this becomes another issue of whether translations are correct or not, but it suggests that the people well before Christ who were translating it to Greek understood the term to mean ""virgin.""

*Parthenos* can also mean ""maiden"".  IIRC Dinah is referred to by it after she's raped (though I'm not entirely sure, and there are other possible explanations I think).  Regardless, it is used in places where virginity isn't implied.  While the LXX is useful for the elucidation of unknown words and weird phrasings, I don't think it makes sense to take the semantics of the words chosen as authoritative.  After all, they were translating from their second language to their third language (or vice-versa)."

gazork_chumble_spuzz,Parenting,1388959645.0,"&gt;But it's times where I feel like I've failed not only me but my son. I have had horrible thoughts since he was born about messing him up, not teaching him the right things, not doing the crucial things for him while he is a baby that could help him succeed in the future.

Hey, that doesn't mean you've failed! My kids are 9 and 8, and I *still* feel like that - wondering if I'm doing a good enough job, wondering if I'm preparing them for life adequately and doing enough to shape their character, etc. That's a normal way for a parent to feel, and you feel that way because you love your son and want the best for him. Don't feel bad about having those thoughts!

&gt;I don't give him enough ""tummy time"" 

I never did either. My kids are fine and your son will be too. It's okay!

&gt;and his head is still wobbly 

He's only 3 months old. That's normal too. Some kids are stronger than others - my son could hold his head up like a champ at that age, but my daughter was still not too strong and had a very wobbly head at that age. Every baby is different and there is a wide range of normal. Have you read much about normal infant and childhood development? it might help you feel more relaxed if you do.

&gt;and he doesn't ""talk"" as much as he used to and I wonder all the time if it's because of something I've done.

Nah. Babies go through stages. If he's 3 and not talking, then you will need to speak to a doctor, but he's tiny and it's normal for them to sometimes be quieter. 

&gt;I lay at night and cry a lot.

Awww, no! You don't need to do that. You've been a mom for such a short time, and it's overwhelming. But it doesn't sound like you're failing at it. You sound like you really love your son and want to be the best mom you can. That's the opposite of failing. 

Here's the thing. It's super easy to focus on motherhood as a whole - to look at all the responsibility, the years ahead, the discipliine and teaching he will need, the sacrifices you will have to make - and to feel like you're going to drown in it. I think we've all been there! But you don't *have* to do it all at once. You don't have to do all of those things at the same time. You have this moment. Right now. This hour, this day. Try and just look at what's in front of you right at the moment and let go of your worries about all the other hours and moments and days that the future will bring. I find that helps me quite a bit when I get worried about all the ""what if"" - I remind myself that *right now*, all I have to do is _________ and I don't have to do all that other stuff.

&gt;I'm not used to having some depend on me 100%. Let alone someone who cries a lot and does nothing but sleep, eat, and poop and occasionally smile at me.

LOL Yeah, babies are like that. It's a big adjustment. But don't forget, you aren't alone - you have your fiance, and it sounds like your mom is supportive too. You've got people rootin' for you, who are willing to help you learn how to be a parent. 

Your son won't be a baby forever. It won't be long before he's a toddler and you miss the days of being able to set him on a blanket and know that he will stay there. lol 

&gt;I guess what I'm trying to say is when does it get better? 

You get used to the responsibility. You get into a routine with your baby. And he will grow up slowly but surely. It is no less of a responsibility as they grow, but in some ways it gets easier as they are less dependent on you to meet every single physical need. Eventually he will be school aged - he will be able to feed and dress himself, take himself to the bathroom, have a shower, help out around the house, and be reasoned with. Kids are more and more fun the older they get - mine are old enough now that we can have some surprisingly deep conversations, and they are less interested in baby games and more interested in things that I enjoy too, like dancing and tobogganing and making stuff in the kitchen and telling jokes and running around the park. I'm still responsible for them like I was before, but they are less helpless and as time goes by they become more and more independent, and it's not like it was when they were babies. Hang in there!

&gt;I feel like I'm a failure, I really do. My mom came up to town for Christmas and made him laugh and I can't even do that. What have I done wrong?

Your mom has more experience with babies than you do...she raised *you*.  : )   I had no sweet clue what to do with my firstborn because I had essentially no experience with babies. My husband did, and he had no problem bathing our son, or changing his diaper, or keeping him amused. I had to learn as I went and it took a while. Be patient with yourself...it takes time to get to know your baby. Eventually you will recognize his different cries, and you'll learn how to play with him and tease smiles and laughs out of him. It just takes a while. 

Cut yourself some slack, mama! You're doing fine. Everyone worries about these things. It's going to be okay."

Reddit isn't really a welcoming place for anyone who's overweight, but it's even worse if you are a woman. That thread so quickly devolved into one big fat shaming circlejerk...that's unfortunately what I have come to expect from this website. I do my best to counter all the fat shaming crap I encounter but people are so devoted to their prejudice that there's just no reasoning with them. I say to heck with the morons who feel like fat women aren't allowed to accept their bodies or *gasp* take pictures of them - this woman's doing something that probably none of them are brave enough to do! What do they know?

However, I think that the people who were not there to fat shame had some really good advice about the lighting and composition of the photos. They were good, but there are things the photographer could do to make them better.

FlashAttack,fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,1388959920.0,"Slugs and snails have a very high percentage of their body-weight made up of water, compared to other animals. Additionally, their skin is a much more permeable to water loss as well as ions and other small molecules, this is why they must keep their skin very moist. When salt comes into contact with the skin of a slug or snail, osmosis drags water out through the cells lining the skin due to the 
sudden high concentration of a pure salt crystal on the surface of its skin. Certain species can deal with small crystals of salt by excreting large amounts of mucus in the area, reducing contact and 
water loss. However, when the salt load is too much, large amounts of water are osmotically drawn out the snail and results in severe dehydration. The snail will lose volume due to water loss and 
will no longer be able to carry out basic cellular function. This is an efficient and cruel way to kill snails.

teralaser,sailing,1388960240.0,"My 10 cents from arranging bare-boat charter tours in BVI, Croatia etc.:

* ---Who to ask/bring:
* Be picky with whom you bring, many people turn into monsters in a small space like a boat (especially if a long or expensive trip)
* Try to get anyone on the water for just 1 hr in a sailboat if they never tried - many newbs are very surprised at how boats slant etc.
* Think of it as arranging a party - don't get too wide on age range etc..
* Consider not to be too few. If it's just you and your wife e.g., you'll have to make all meals, all decisions, steer all the time, etc..
* Consider not to be too many. If you fill a boat to the max, sometimes there is not even space to sit under the bimini in the shadow for everybody.
* --- Being a captain:
* Go on trips with more experienced captains :) ... you can learn a lot.
* Buy [a cruising guide](http://www.cruisingguides.com/) and peruse it, get an idea what's around before you go.
* Do **not** delegate when it comes to boat security, boat introduction, how to use the engine, navigation, perhaps even buying food. But try to let others have an impression that they sail, let them steer, winch etc..
* You must know where EVERYTHING is... Spare anchor? Life raft? Sea cocks? Emergency rudder? Valve to switch between the 2 water tanks? - and tell your crew not to rearrange everything as they see fit :P
* Do delegate everybody when going to harbour and insist they will help (especially in the Mediterranean and if boat&gt;35ft). In the start it will be messy, but people find their roles, and life will be so much more relaxing.
* Remember to hold a little security speech to everybody (flares, life raft, VHF, don't get hit by boom etc.).
* As a skipper your **foremost job** is to keep a happy mood on board, so the crew wants to sail with you again. Be in a good mood, even when things go a little bit crazy. Don't be too much of a ""boss"" - people are on a holiday, just a little bit of democracy gets a long way. Take care to make everybody feel appreciated and heard, and understand what is going on."

There are many, many cases where ""conscious"" sedation turns into a room air general.  We get called to bail out these cases from time to time.  There are also cases that I've seen and heard about where patients end up getting 8-10 mg of Versed and stay 6 hours post-colonoscopy because they won't wake up.

jeffbingham,worldnews,1388961095.0,"&gt;Yeah it's totally xenophobia and ""being cool"", it has nothing to do with your terrible actions worldwide for 60 or so years.

Yeah, it really is. People will always remember your failures before your successes. It's easier to blindly hate an entire nation and all of  it's people for the rest of your life, because of some regrettable incidents that someone once told you about that you don't even fully understand, and to completely ignore all of the good that same nation has done, than to see something as other than black and white. Easier isn't better though. 

&gt;Says the dude living in the US.

Living in America doesn't mean you listen to American news sources at all or exclusively. That's an ignorant *ass*umption to make. 

&gt;Please tell me how the enormous waste of time that was the Iraq invasion was ""done right"". Maybe also explain why you even invaded unrelated countries after 9/11.

How about you take the time to learn these things on your own? It's not a good thing to rely on others to spoon feed you information. That's lazy. Don't be lazy, or you'll be a hypocrite when you call someone a ""lazy American"". You don't want to be a hypocrite, do you?

Breal3030,Supplements,1388961286.0,"I really hate that I am having to defend them (as I don't even really buy from them much), but I'm not sure I agree.

I am not trying to imply that everything they do is brand new (the ""herbals"" I listed are examples of stuff that has been around) or that they actually developed many of these ingredients. 

I am speaking to making them widely available, compared to similar major supplement companies geared towards retail consumers, not ingredient manufacturers or bulk resellers or anything.

There are several examples. They started the ""myostatin"" craze ~15 (or however many) years ago. I'd be interested to know what other company you bought your l-tyrosine blend from 10-15 (or more) years ago, sulbutiamine from ~10 years ago, or who you got your casein hydrolysate, cyanidin, 7-hydroxy-pc (7-hydroxy-5-methyl-3-phenylchromone propylcarbonate), phenibut, or your pre-workout containing either oligodextrins, isomaltulose, or an electrolyte profile that is similar to (what is now) Surge at the time that any of those products came out.

Again, I'm not trying to defend whether any of those things are effective, or whether they are worth the money (as we know now myostatin supps were completely worthless among others), but I believe they push the boundaries when it comes to making new or novel ingredients and/or formulations widely available, and they do so with (sometimes theoretically) proper dosing and high quality (flavor shots!)."

GeckoRocket,tall,1388961339.0,"Thanks for the sarcasm old sport, of course I am aware the seat can recline.  That does nothing for my knees though. My femurs do not shrink, do yours?

I can fit into the airline seat, but when they move the seat in front of me into my knees it's less than comfortable.  It's not required that they recline the seats - in fact, some seats in the plane do not recline on most airlines (usually around the emergency exits), and some seats are broken.  It's a privilege to recline, not a right.

Your logic on making someone miserable is faulty - if I am perfectly fine while the seats are in a standard mode (edit for clarity - it is assumed we are both at the same comfort level in the same upright position), when the person in front of me reclines their seat, they are increasing their comfort at the cost of mine.  Not only that - while they are sitting in their seat, I am not touching them or hindering them in any way, nor am I attempting to compress any part of their body.  Once they recline into my knees, they are doing all of those things to me.

I was previously against the idea of them anyway due to their permanence, not wanting to be old with ugly tattoos. However I've spoken to friends who have gone under the gun and they've said that when the tattoos fade and grow old with them they'll be able to look back and be reminded of when they were young, full of life and charm and remember their old days of hedonism or the person the tattoo is for with wistfulness. We're not guaranteed to age well anyway, and there's no point worrying about how ugly we'll look when we're older because it'll happen anyway, tattoos let us live in the now.

With that in mind I have about 6 ideas I'm thinking of, mainly on the torso but some on the upper arm and one on the feet. Just need to get money and then choose a small one to see if I can take the pain."

&gt; Sakamichi Onoda is an otaku, an anime obsessive, who has just entered high school and plans to join the anime club. In middle school Onoda did not have any friends with whom he could talk about anime, games, Akihabara and other otaku things and is hoping he can make such friends in the anime club, but he finds out it has been disbanded. In order to reestablish the club he tries to find 4 other people who would like to join.

&gt; Since he was a little boy, Onoda has ridden his mamachari (""City Bike"" AKA ""Mommy Bike"" in the anime) – a bulky bicycle with a step-through frame mainly used for short rides, such as for casual fun, to pick up groceries or to go to Akihabara every week to check out or buy otaku things. His fellow freshman, Shunsuke Imaizumi, a cyclist, while training, notices Onoda riding his mamachari up a steep road.
Shōkichi Naruko, visit Akihabara to get some Gundam plastic models for his younger brothers and he meets Onoda, who caught his attention because of the his cycling skill on the mamachari and later finds out they go to the same school. Later on, both Naruko and Imaizumi try to convince him to join the bicycle racing club, but will he?

Maybe the mods would need to look at what has changed and how people might feel about this, big changes could help things for the better. I think /r/malefashionadvice shows a good example of how change can have big effects; with the move to self posts and structured threads they seem to have mixed it up a lot, hopefully time will tell if it works. 

Personally I would love to see space given to specifically timed threads where people can post relationship, sex and similar kind of topics without them clogging up the main page.

I'm totally happy hitting something like an Ash Zealot with a Mana Leak on the play, or a curve topper like Hellrider. I'd pick it over Worn Powerstone in this situation I think.

In this situation, if you wanted to push control... P1P1 Baneslayer is great, with the probability of wheeling either Mulldrifter or Cyclonic Rift pretty good. Worst case scenario, you'll get that Ronom Unicorn back which will be your solution for Sulfuric Vortex. P1P2 Control Magic is fine, but you couldn't go wrong with Terminus or Shriekmaw either. If either of those or Preordain wheel you'll be in good shape. P1P3 Mana Leak is what I'd take, Worn Powerstone, Grand Arbiter Augustin IV, and Gilded Lotus as probable wheels.

What do you mean when you say Sulfuric Vortex is a blank? I'm surprised to see so many people picking it right away, it usually goes around and around in my playgroup. Might have something to do with it popping up in the third pack."

I'm not sure I would change who I am just to make my life easier, assuming women have it easier (which I'm agnostic about).  So the transaction costs are high, even ignoring the practical problems associated with transitioning. 

Would you become norwegian, and only norwegian, abandoning your current nationality and state-specific life experience, if you could? They have tons of oil money and a well-functioning state. 

I don't want to be some norwegian guy, I want to be me. And nationality is a smaller part of you than your sex.

Other problems with the question include: 

- Changing who you are does nothing to help those who stay

- Some of the disadvantages/advantages women have are rooted in biology, which society is powerless about. A group could be simultaneously oppressed and biologically better off.

Willravel,TrueAskReddit,1388964687.0,"General thinking is democracy is slower but harder for leaders to control and thus abuse, and dictatorship is faster but easier for leaders to control and thus abuse. Benevolent dictators will be better than an uneducated public, certainly, but consider what percentage of leaders are incorruptible, benevolent people compared to the greedy and the cruel, and it seems like quite the risk for short-term gain. 

Say we have a six-sided die and we assign the last 6 American presidents each a number, one through six. Each of the last six presidents was hungry enough to do what was necessary to get elected, so we can assume that kind of ambition could also translate to becoming a dictator. We're just as likely to get an idiot arch-conservative like George W. Bush as we are a peanut-farming progressive like Jimmy Carter, as likely to get a neocon puppet like Ronald Reagan as we are a moderate but practical tool like Bill Clinton. You can't imagine Carter as a dictator without considering what W. Bush would be like as a dictator, and that should scare the shit out of you.

We do a lot of general anesthesia for peds dentistry.  It's safer that way, and the dentist can get the work done in record time when they don't have to fight a squirmy kid.

It's a shame your anesthesiologists don't want to help.  I do outpatient GI, but used to do some in-hospital cases, too.  We'd travel to the ICU, or to the GI suite for difficult-to-sedate patients.  One hospital moved to anesthesiologists/CRNAs doing all the EGD and COL's, and I think it improved efficiency and patient satisfaction.  We ran 2-3 GI rooms each day, and if there was an urgent case, it just got added into the regular schedule for the day.

When I switched over I was smoking around 4-5 a day too. I also smoked more when I was out drinking a couple times a week. I have always used a low dose (9-12mg). 

The lower amount is working great during the day. The best thing in my opinion is you can just take a couple puffs and not be committed to the rest of an entire cigarette, so I have probably actually cut back some in that respect. As for when I'm out with a beer it's a little tougher, but not bad as long as I have my EVOD on me. I do puff it a lot more when I'm drinking though.

- Your dominant mood decides the bonuses, your dominant mood is the one that is furthest away from the middle (you can see it on the lecture screen in the upper right corner). If several moods are equal then the left most one ""wins"". (aka if Angry and Willfull are maxed out then Angry wins out)

- You can prevent every assassination attempt either by finding out who is after you before it happens or by not pissing off the person who does it. (for example how you resolve the conflict with the province and how you deal with the convicted woman can both trigger attempts)

breathcomposed,MakeupAddiction,1388965804.0,"&gt; So I have a challenge for you. Go out sometime without makeup. It doesn’t even have to be without it entirely, but maybe skip the eye shadow and liner. Don’t worry about the blush. Maybe be daring and only apply your concealer one day. It’s difficult to do at first, but after you’ve gotten used to accepting that it’s you that matters, not your makeup, you might realize that there are better things to focus on before a presentation or a date. You might start to accept that perfection is ridiculous, and there are different types of perfection. That people will respect you more for your self-confidence than for your flawless makeup application.

I found this bit surprisingly offensive. I'm new to makeup and my currently FOTD only consists of drawn-on eyebrows (due to overplucking - I'm growing them out though!), mascara, and Burt's Bees lip balm. That's it. No foundation, concealer, powder, bronzer, blush. None of that. After reading this, it frightens me to even *consider* buying (much less applying) any of those things. I've noticed that on the very rare occasions I do have a full face on, yes, I do feel more confident (that's because I'm a tomboy and that's the only time I ever feel ""girly) - but who doesn't? This author makes it sound like it's something MUA's need to be almost *ashamed* of. I just don't get it. By the title, I thought this article would be uplifting or inspiring, but it's anything but.

105Hummel,circlejerk,1388965887.0,"Your submission was removed from IAmA. IAmA's should focus on something uncommon that plays a central role in your life or a truly unique and interesting event. Your AMA would be better suited for /r/CasualIAmA!

Edit:
I can see that you’re all unhappy about BLB’s IAmA being removed; the many courteous and polite replies have made that clear. Unfortunately, in delineating what a subreddit is for, sometimes popular content gets moved elsewhere. IAmA itself came about because they were removed from /r/AskReddit despite being very popular there. Being removed doesn’t make the content bad, it just makes the content in the wrong place. He’s welcome to post it in /r/CasualIAmA (as I suggested), or somewhere more relevant like /r/adviceanimals.
So, why doesn’t this fit within IAmA’s guidelines?
Well, first it isn't an ""event"". That part of the rule is there to allow something like ""I was at woodstock"" while disallowing something like ""I farted"".

Second: it's not particularly unique. There are new ""memes"" every day, and growing. And it isn’t just meme pics that we allowed; viral videos, popular gimmicks, etc. Where’s the line between “A photo of me is on the top of /r/adviceanimals"" (which would seemingly be allowed) and ""A video of me is on the top of /r/videos""? Is that allowed? And if you allow that, why not ""My question is at the top of askreddit""? There would be a very low standard of what our subreddit was for; seeming ly anything on the front page would be worthy of an IAmA.

And third, we should look at what IAmA was for. It was supposed to be about Redditors being able to share their experiences from outside of Reddit and the internet. It's about what they do with their lives. That's not the situation we have here. The actual ""bad luck brian"" person has nothing to do with the meme. Again, that's why the ridiculously photogenic guy one was different: this had led to a huge media blitz for him, to the point where his life has been significantly impacted. In this very thread, Bad Luck Brian said that it hadn't really affected his life at all."

jeffbingham,worldnews,1388965994.0,"&gt;Please take a minute to google ""Covert United States foreign regime change actions"", and then consider whether you are or not in fact a shit country and the bad guys.

What makes you think I don't already know about any of that? It's all common knowledge. You know, America has this wonderful thing called ""freedom of information"" that prevents things like that from being hidden from it's citizens, right? It's kind of nifty. 

&gt;It's a mixture of that and your compatriots extreme crazy people nationalism that makes people dislike your country. You have it worse than most but you wouldn't know from all the baseless boasting and chest puffing.

Are you really so ignorant that you actually think all Americans are like that? Please tell me that was some form of humor. 

&gt;What makes you think I would be reading biased sources if you acknowledge the international nature of media? 

Your narrow minded and ignorant opinions are what make me think you're reading biased sources. I don't know what your sources for news are, but I don't care either. 

&gt;The most biased sources come out of your own country and they drill disinformation into your heads ad nauseum.

Yeah... that's an opinion based on almost nothing though. You don't watch/read/listen to every source of news in the world. That being said, America's news does tend to be very biased, but it's based on the opinions of the Democrats and Republicans that own the media corporations, and a desire for ratings. Sources like Fox are for rednecks that need to be spoon fed opinions, sources like CNN are for those a rung higher than rednecks on the social ladder but who also need to be spoon fed opinions. Intelligent Americans do not listen to, read, or watch that crap. There are most definitely much more biased sources of news than American ones, if you weren't so eager to be against America because it makes you feel cool, you might think of some. 

&gt;So, in regards to Iraq, you have no argument whatsoever? That's cool, I didn't think so. I've already done my research, not that it's needed to know that it was a completely retarded decision and that they were lying the entire time. Not to mention how much you damaged your own image and made more enemies. Success!

An argument doesn't need to be made by me, you  just need to do the research you claim to have done. The WMD thing was absolutely a lie, by Bush and his administration, not the American people. We trusted that our President would do his job correctly and rely on valid information rather than fabricate it. I don't deny for a second we've hurt our image as a country for allowing things to be done out of fear for our future safety and security. We even went as far as to sacrifice freedoms we'll never get back in the hopes of feeling secure again. 

You keep bringing things like that up as if I'm denying they have happened or as if I'm unaware. I'm not denying them, and I'm aware. The majority of Americans are in fact aware and none of those that are aware deny these things.  

&gt;Why would I be upset? I'm here of my own accord making fun of people like you and watching you struggle to argue. This whole ""LOL IM SO LAUGHING NOW"" in lieu of an argument is a good indicator that the person you're arguing with has no point.

You sure *seem* upset, you're come across that way. I really was laughing, and wanted you to know it, it wasn't in lieu of an argument either. You called me a ""dopey motherfucker"" and it made me laugh. 

Why would I argue? Why would I waste the time trying to convince you that you're wrong? You would never accept it, no matter how much information I provide. If it were even possible to convince you, it would take a much longer time than I care to spend talking to you. You can't change what someone believes is a fact in one comment. You're stuck in one view of the world, I can't change that. I can mock you for it though.  

Could you stop referring to me as America? I'm a person, an individual- not a country. I haven't proof read, so have fun pointing out any mistakes as if they make me wrong.  "

I first want to point you to the [exit guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/wiki/index#wiki_exit_guide) linked in the right-hand column. It is possible to exit the JW's without losing contact with your family. Your mileage will vary, but please read the guide and have some hope that it may not be as bad as you fear.

You've seen the conundrum at the heart of much of the JW doctrine: they stop *just short* of laying down specific laws in many instances so that they can defensively say, ""You're free to choose"", but the truth about The Truth is that you aren't free. If you deviate from the commonly-accepted way to worship and behave, you're shunned — either officially or unofficially as ""bad association"".

I posted a lengthy comment in response to another person who is in a similar situation. The short of it is, Jesus taught love. He counseled moderation, love, and *against* taking an extreme hard-line stance. 

How can the JW's be Jesus' chosen organization when they are the opposite of this? Anyone can read the story of Jesus' life as presented in the bible and see the difference between him and the reality of the JW teachings.

In addition to what /u/LightBladeX said, you can basically think of the ""experience loss"" in this scenario as the loss of *real-world* life experience - and not just the old in-game combat experience that was stored in the ""body"" of the in-game avatar. Since their real minds are within the world of Elder Tale, along with their bodies, their own memories are now able to be lost as well."

marcm6246,AskReddit,1388966593.0,"But here's the thing - I don't know what I want. All throughout high school I liked every subject, except for math. I don't even know if I want to go to university. Do I miss being in class and having purpose in my life? Yes. Am I absolutely terrified of going into the unknown and being independent while also not knowing what I want to study? Yes. I'm torn. 

On the other hand, I like the thought of going on school trips worldwide and the possibility of doing an exchange abroad. I also suffer from anxiety and depression, so I feel like the experience of university would be essential for my recovery and the transition to the real world. Also making new friends and a university degree in anything would be good for me.

I do know two things i'd like to do. I'd like to try modeling and perhaps acting. I'd like to maybe go to L.A. and see if I have any success. But i'm not nearly in a good state of mind to pack my bags and go. I'd also like to give track cycling and skeleton a shot, the sports. 

So I don't have a burning desire to go to university, but I don't want to stay behind another year with no idea what to do. This is why i'm so damn stressed. Life is terrible right now, and i'm 19. I should be happy. But i'm not :( Besides, my dad already has a trust fund toward my education with like, 18,000 in it. I'd be foolish not to at least go and see if university is for me. "

Starwhisperer,AskReddit,1388967756.0,"I'm sorry, I just don't understand why people think emotions are evil and a sure sign for disaster. What is so wrong with emotions? We have emotions for a reason and those reasons come from the context of what ever situation we might found ourselves in. I don't know but I wouldn't even want to have control of my emotions. That sort of takes out the surprise and genuineness of life if we can choose at any moment how we are going to feel. Where is the spontaneity? Or the surprise?   
  
If we're, for example, angry, what is so bad about acting out in your anger. Of course, if you are referring to acting out by punching said person then that is totally wrong. But there are COUNTLESS ways to express your anger that does not involve violence. It could be choosing not to hang out with said person. Or, walking away. Whatever strategy that will be useful to do what you wish for that emotion. Choosing to ignore one's anger does not lead to some magical wonderland. It leads us into a cycle of not truly comprehending the facets of said emotions and without that, how can we truly understand ourselves. In addition, how can we express and share our emotional character to others if we are failing to be honest with ourselves?
  
Emotions make us humans. And acting on our emotions make us even more so. I think what people mean to say is that we should aim to act on our emotions with tact, prudence, and understanding. Rather than advising people to not act out at all. We are not robots.  
  
And, if I just understood the advice wrong then my bad. But, there seems to be a common consensus around here that emotions lead to nothing but trouble. Not all emotions are ""negative"", and even what people may refer to as negative emotions can be acted upon in a positive manner. "

And the last time that stuff was funny for humor's sake was when I was 5 I think.  Because it's not all that entertaining. 

__________

My take on it: 

Hanako games: 

1.) Are a female dev who has been doing that for quite a long time

2.) Who openly make games from a female POV and for female audiences

3.) With plenty of female lead characters and supporting characters and and and and 

4.) This game specifically managed to rather subvert a ton of princess stereotypes while still being completely entertaining. Oh and even has itself lesbian characters and same sex romance options. 

Them getting picked up by people like Northernlion and TB is a sizably big deal for an indie developer. And even though it seems that NL liked the game more than TB did (and I personally tend to prefer NL over TB, but then again, I've been subscribed to him even longer) I thought NL didn't do the best job in his Let's Look At really explaining the game and why it works (despite the fact that he obviously agrees that it works). He seemed to get too jumbled in explaining that mechanics. While TB's stream did a much better job of showing how insane and hilarious and hard this game is and why it might appeal to you. Again, it's totally possible that TB's WTF video will suck or that NL will do a stream that's even better than TB's stream, but at this moment, I think TB's stream did a better job at showing off the game than Ryan's video. 

I also think it's pretty neat that TB's wife kicked him to take a look at a game he would never have looked at in a million years because she personally has been playing and enjoying it. Yeah for outside the comfort zone. "

next-- the future is all about having laptop/tablets all in one. today, you can buy a windows 8.1 tablet with specs similar to my thinkpad, that is a tablet as well as a full-featured laptop. so now, instead of having a laptop/desktop and tablet separately, you have it all in one device. i believe apple and google will eventually have to copy this to keep competitive, but in the meantime windows is clearly the best option in both the laptop and tablet categories."

Your sentence doesn't make sense either. Psychosis is a disease that requires diagnosis via a doctor. Are you a doctor? Did we recently have an appointment that justifies what you say?

Further, your sentence uses two opposing adjectives. You use the words justify and senseless. Justification implies structured sensibility prior to debate. Senseless precludes no justification. So, which is it?

Further, I'm not sure how or why someone would want to steal a bad app. A good app maybe. My conditions for a good app include the ability to purchase that app however. I don't see how that can be abstracted to equal your conclusions. Bad apps get tested and deleted.

This is about market forces. Look at digital music to see what changed there and how it changed. The market wanted music to be distributed differently and the market forced that change. It was done illegally by some, or at the least, outside of scope of what the RIAA had in mind. But in the end, consumer choice won out. It's important to consider ethics. Ultimately if the primary concern is not about what he consumer wants, that risks the success of an app, product or service. Providers and vendors can say what they want about the legal issues in these cases, but if they don't change to offer what consumers want in the end the consumers go away and the businesses do too.

Idiocy changed the music industry for the better, for consumers and musicians. It can do the same for apps as well.

I don't steal or use bad apps. I pay for good apps. The conditions that exist that allow for what OP posted is one of the reasons why."

Vash88,Battlefield,1388968870.0,I think the main reason this is all happening is because EA wants to make BF4 more vehicle based to keep it different from their competition like CoD. In order to make sure everyone who picks up the game can have fun in a tank even if they suck they just make it impossible for a single engineer to take down a tank. This has been a trend ever sense Bad Company came out and started to make vehicles stronger. In BF2142 you could take down a tank with 1 well place shot in the back vent of a tank( unless they jumped out right away and put out the fire with a repair tool ). Now you need to fire all of your RPGs just to TRY to take down ONE tank and if they decide to run and repair after 1 or 2 shots good luck killing anything else with you remaining 1 RPG. Also pray to god the tank you are fighting does not have a buffed tank.

AnotherCrazyOne,Android,1388968936.0,"You describe pretty much what I do. Thank you for the voice of reason.

Overall too, I describe something less self-centered as well. Apps that exist because they are subsidized by advertising rather than direct purchase are not pressured to be as good as apps that are purchased directly. I know that a developer is tied to the success of the advertising in order to make money. One would presumably abstract that the quality of the app itself and the quality of the user experience were primary in order to insure metrics that reflect successful engagement and a ROI. However, advertising tactics do not always follow that path of integrity as is the case with OP and many other apps.

As a web developer who monetizes via advertising and e-commerce, I can see there can be a need for both models. Advertising traditionally and still today succeeds with content and media publishing, where e-commerce has more to do with end product purchases. Keeping what you provide as a developer or vendor in line with these principles is what will spell success or failure.

The Android market is a cloudy place that doesn't offer the same profit margins as other platforms provide. Whether it's the devices or the software on them, the advertising subsidy model just doesn't have the same return other platforms enjoy.

All this doesn't justify anything. All it says is that if you want to make money, make good apps and charge for them. And if the platform you're on is also subsidized, consider your demographics and target to those that have the money to buy your apps. A subsidized product purchase does not equal a consumer that's ready to purchase your app by default at all. It's a risky market as such, so you'll need to dig to find those consumers that will buy. If your app provides media in some way for consumption like Pandora or other though, advertising will work regardless of platform. Just make sure there's a service subscription model to go along with the advert model."
