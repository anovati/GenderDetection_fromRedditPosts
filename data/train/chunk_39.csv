On the other hand, having 0 as freezing is clearly very useful, since the freezing point of water can have an everyday effect on our lives. Boiling point is less important (in my experience), since the only times I can recall having to remember the boiling point of water in fahrenheit was to calibrate a thermometer.

* The transfer is not instantaneous, so the server must track progress and send updates out to clients.  If someone exits a lift while its moving, or just jumps up and down the lift, the clients need to know.
* The clients must animate the process.  Even though they're receiving discrete updates from the server, they need to correctly show smooth motion.
* As you say, the ""graphics"", meaning the people on the lift need to be shown on the lift.
* A player who is riding the lift needs to have their point of view continuously (not stepwise) adjusted to reflect the changing position.
* Physics needs to interact correctly with things on the lift.  If you fall into a lift, the lift should step you.  If you drop something into a lift, it should land in the lift.

As for listening to what your body tells you - well, that comes with practice. I find that it can help to sit somewhere quiet and just breathe, and think about your body, how you're feeling. Do you feel tired? stomach feel odd or empty? mouth dry? etc., and if so, think about when you last ate or drank, what it was, whether you're under a lot of stress or in need of rest, that kind of thing.

With low bar I think with long femurs you want some ankle ROM to allow your knees to go forward somewhat, but not nearly as much as you need with high bar.  The hips back cue to me (again I can't say for sure if it's long femurs or something else) just loads my legs better vs my back and has been much better for my hips."

For sci-fi, my favorite is Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky brothers. It's a very different kind of ""alien encounter"" book.

For coming of age, any of John Green's books are fabulous. I haven't read The Fault in Our Stars yet, but it seems to be everyone's favorite. I love Paper Towns. It's a beautiful story and really taught me a lot about how we see people. Barry Lyga is also good for coming of age stories. It's hard to say which of his books are my favorite. Boy Toy is a really interesting story of a young boy who was seduced by his teacher, Hero Type is about a kid who saved a girl, but has a dark secret about how. I think those two would be my favorites.

Since you mentioned Harry Potter, there is a series called The Last Apprentice that is great for HP fans. They are very simply told, usually in the children's intermediate series sections of bookstores, but they are just amazing. It's set far back, I'm not sure the century, but much before modern technology. A young boy, a seventh son of a seventh son, begins an apprenticeship with the County's Spook. He learns to fight creatures of the dark and is soon tangled up in the plot to destroy the Fiend forever. Wonderful books. I got two new ones for Christmas and ate them up."

When you choose to retire, if you can afford to, you have no place cheaper to move.

That is the benefits of living and working in ""super expensive"" areas. The cost of living is inflated but so are the wages. Which means the retirement money put away when you can save 12% of your wage is significantly larger."

Nobody can do absolutely anything they want to do - we all have limits. I think it's better to tell kids that they should explore their limits: if you want to learn or do something, go for it, give it your best try. If you're good at it, awesome! You've acquired a new skill. If you just physically/mentally can't do it even after giving it a good try, that's okay...you did your best, and you learned something in the process. You can't necessarily be anything you want to be, but until you try you will never know what you *can* be. In my opinion, this sets kids up for less disappointment than if you just tell them they're Superman and can do anything.

Also, this applies equally to little boys as it does to little girls."

We got talking,walked to the train station together and then met up the next day. We spent all day and night together, going to different pubs and talking all night. We ended up at a playground and sat on the equipment at 3 am and then kissed. I was so nervous but fuck, the kissing was great.

We texted all the time and met up a lot, held hands etc. He was a backpacker and was leaving the next day to travel to Africa. We booked a hotel room and spent the night together, just kissing and a bit of under the sheets groping.

He still texted me in Africa, sending me photos of his safari. The contact got less and less, and I cut off contact, briefly talked to him when I was in a new relationship years later,which was disrespectful towards my then boyfriend.

TheeLinker,mylittlepony,1390614820.0,"[](/rcelestia) Celestia as a joke character is pretty interesting, because when it comes to oddball comedy, she *never* has her show personality. There's just... nothing to work with there, you know? By canon, she's a friendly, benevolent ruler who tends not to do... anything, really. By (comedy) fanon, if she's there to serve as anything more than the straight man, she invariably ranges anywhere between Bitchlestia and Trollestia and Tyrant Celestia ^(and lest we forget the Molestia fringe, of course.)

[](/rcelestiawut) In all but the most off-the-wall of fan-comedy, most of the characters' personalities are the same, but maybe taken farther. Applejack by canon would never literally say 'Who pissed in your cake this morning,' but it's within her personality to get upset and speak her mind; the crudeness is the sole added element, I think. Celestia's personality is *fabricated out of thin air* because of how little a comedic character she truly is. Not by me, of course -- I'm not doing anything super-original where Celestia characterization is concerned. My Celestia's personality isn't too far off from one of her [most famous fan renditions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY), I think.

devilinmexico13,Pathfinder_RPG,1390615121.0,"Well, if you're looking to increase your roleplaying ability, I think you're still coming at it from the completely wrong angle. I tweak my characters out to be incredibly good at what they do, I consider long term survivability, and sure, I can be a bit of a munchkin at times, BUT no one has ever criticized my ability to get into character. The problem with your approach is that you're still coming at it completely from a mechanics perspective, and those have nothing to do with your ability to get into character and maintain a consistent personality for that character. 

Your character isn't the stats on the page, those just tell you your capabilities. If you want to improve the in character part of your play, forget about the character sheet entirely. First, figure out what experiences your character has had. What made them who they are? How will you react to different circumstances? Has your character been betrayed in the past? If so, you should be slow to trust people, question their motives. Is he horribly naive? Then trust anyone, never assume that your about to enter combat, always assume the best of everyone. These are the questions you should ask yourself, this part of the game has nothing at all to do with what you write down on the page, and should come before you even think of anything but race and class. 

I'll give you an example from a campaign that we recently completed. My character was a Tiefling Magus (bladebound and kensai archetypes) named Nicos Lebeda. Already, just from the name I'm telling you something about the character. His last name is Lebeda, a noble family from Brevoy, yet he's a Teifling. The reason for this is that he was the illegitimate son of a Brevish noble sent to Cheliax as an ambassador. His father loved the boy, but died when Nicos was a teenager, and his disgraced stepmother kicked him out onto the street. Because of this, he believes that people have good in them (because of his father), but also understands that they will betray you if it's in their best intrest (from his stepmother). He also hates the fact that he's a Tiefling (his father had a thing for Tiefling prostitutes), and wishes that he had never been born. Because of this, he throws himself into combat with reckless abandon, and devotes himself to lost causes (this was a Council of Thieves game, and this personality trait is what lead him to the burgeoning rebellion in Westcrown). After he ends up on the street, he is taken in by a bartender named Mac who also happens to be a cleric of Caiden Caylen, giving Nicos both his religion and a soft spot for the common folk (also a motivating factor leading him to the rebellion). All of this came before I had decided anything more than just a race and class combo, and informed how I played the character throughout the campaign. He was bold, brave, reckless, hated the Hellknights and most Chelish nobility with a passion. He was also a good hearted man, willing to help those in need with no regard for himself, but prone to fits of self loathing when things went wrong, blaming himself and sulking for things outside his control. 

My point in all this is, divorce your roleplaying entirely from the mechanics of the game. The two are, and should be, completely separate from one another. This is the Stormwind Fallacy in action. Min maxing your character has nothing whatsoever to do with how well you roleplay, and purposely gimping your character won't magically make you a good roleplayer, it just leaves you with a shitty character.

I got pretty mad, because a girl with whom I thought I was hitting it off isn't really texting me any more (it happens, I'm not a pussy about it, I don't dwell on it, but it still sucks), and I really didn't want to hear about this trashy, slutty, borderline incestuous encounter that a person with whom I'm not even really that good of friends was telling me for sympathy.

She wrote:

 ""I was just anxious about him not texting me back because I told him some pretty heavy stuff""

Having tried to change the subject several times and it not sinking in, getting bored of her as a person, being kind of drunk (as per usual), I decided to go wildcard for once in my life and responded:

""yo a girl stopped texting me.  I have no idea why.  I think I made myself to available.  I didn't make her touch balls with her cousin while she was in my ass.  you dig?""

If I joined a club, and then discovered that that club was founded to attack people, it continued to attack people, and it was legally protected when it attacked people, then I would leave. I would not stay and legitimise their actions, or help cover them up (actively or inactively). 

The police force cannot be reformed away from these abuses, because these abuses are it's purpose. It's like trying to reform the RSPCA to be a car racing organisation. It won't happen, because animal welfare is their core. Crushing protest and protecting the rich is the *primary purpose* of the police force.

50- summer collection as well, nice nude melon color, i believe this one I got to dupe Crave from Tartes Off The Cuff palette.

27- less sparkly version of Tartes Dazzled. Crazy pigmented and easy to overdo.  Just tap brush once on the pan to pick up color.

Rhodechill,personalfinance,1390616540.0,"**UPDATE:**


Hey there.  I went to enrollment services with an appointment set up.  I was already panicking and thinking about what I would do when they would say no, as most people had already began classes.

The woman went over my profile.  She ended up giving me a $1,900 Perkins loan for my $1,928 debt.  Live saver.  I don't know *why they didn't mention me being eligible for this at all when I went there before and asked!*. That would have saved a lot of stress.  I didn't have to do any begging or crying or anything like that.  I will still be $700 short for Spring 2014 though, but I won't have any holds on my account from that as long as I pay it by the end of the semester.

I am literally so thrilled.  I do have many depressing and bitter thoughts lingering in my skull though, but I won't go there.

I still might look into transferring to a cheaper college though.  Said college does not offer my major though, and I would need 30 credits to transfer otherwise I would need to start off as a freshmen there instead of just transferring to my sophomore year.

I am also still worried about enrolling in classes late, having to pay for textbooks, and a few other things but I am in a lot better of a situation.

I don't even know how Perkins loans work.  She just gave it to me."

Banner_Free,Fitness,1390616700.0,"Okay, I'm not going to downvote you, but just to explain where /u/_payl0ad_ is likely coming from:

Beats aren't generally considered to be bad headphones (except by audiophiles, I guess). They are, however, widely regarded as *overpriced* headphones, which sacrifice the audio quality you'd usually get at in that price bracket in exchange for a shiny logo and trendy marketing.

So, if you have them and you like them and they work for you, then great! Keep on wearing them, enjoying them, and doing what makes you happy. I'm never going to shit on someone for making that decision.

It's worth keeping in mind, though, that a lot of folks recognize that you can get comparable (or better) audio quality at half the price in exchange for losing the ""Beats by Dre"" logo, and some of them will roll their eyes at your choice of headphones.

(If you're a scotch drinker, you can think of Beats headphones as comparable to Johnny Walker Blue Label. Not bad, but certainly overpriced unless you put high value on the brand name.)"

tangonovember,TwoXChromosomes,1390616771.0,"The important thing to know here is that, most likely, this isn't about you. There are lots of external reasons his libido might have dropped - stress from school/work, depression, not eating right/exercising, even male hormonal cycles (yes, they do occur).

The obvious step here is to sit down with him and say you've noticed his sex drive is lower lately, and that you're concerned. You can tell him how you're being affected as well - he might not realize how you're suffering from the lack of attention. Unfortunately, there really isn't a good alternative to this talk. The issue here is almost certainly not related to your own attractiveness, but rather is about either your relationship or his own personal life. And that's going to require some talking to sort out.

As an aside, I don't generally think the ""naked in the living room when he gets home"" or even waking him up in matching underwear are very good ideas for getting sex. When I get home after hours of work and navigating my commute, I'm not really feeling very sexual. If my fiancée were waiting for me naked, I'd feel pressured to perform, not turned on. It works better on me if I have some time to relax and unwind before she starts dropping sexual hints.

Anyway, I hope you and your boyfriend are able to talk openly about this, as it's clear it's very seriously impacting your relationship. Best of luck!"

There isn't. Some cars go 200k and beyond no problem, some start falling apart right after 100k. Depends on the car, depends on the driver, depends on the area it's driven in, depends on how meticulously it was maintained. And even if it was maintained there's no guarantee it will last long.

When I was in college (1999), I worked at one of those dinky independent video rental stores. After jobs in fast food and mall retail, it was a welcome relief. 

Everything there was perfect. I liked the job I did (movies are a huge interest of mine), my co-workers kicked ass, and since the customers were all members who were there regularly, even they kicked ass. Plus, it was the best rate of pay I had gotten thus far.

Unfortunately, what happened to a lot of these places was that the big chains put them out of business, and ours was no exception. Fucking blockbuster. If they had managed to stay open, I would have stayed there for years, even if I got a full time job (I would help out on weekends or something).

A month before they closed, we all got very generous Christmas bonuses in cash. I have worked for several large corporations since then and this dinky, going-out-of-business video store marked the last time I ever got a Christmas bonus.

What are your opinions on the API Superclean Power filter? That's the one with the protein skimmer attached. The girl that works there said it's protein skimmer isn't that great, but for how little it costs it has a great media basket. However they just got in these tiny little protein skimmers for $30 and I might pick one of those up instead if my current filter is okay.

I found a small fully submersible powerhead/filter combo that I think would work well in my tank. It only has room for carbon, though, but someone else on this thread said the filter I have on there right now isn't strong enough.

They probably come around for dinner sometimes, and it's probably all very lovely. It's hard to reconcile the people you know with the violence of the police. No one wants to believe that their friend is a racist. No one likes thinking of their friend as someone who would protect murderers and rapists. Maybe you'll be able to reconcile it at some point, maybe not, and I get that.

I'm not going to let you misrepresent my argument though. This isn't about me and a cop having a fight one time. My experience with cops backs up the evidence which shows that the police have never existed for the purpose of protecting us, and that their job is actually the opposite. I'm arguing that the job of a police officer is fundamentally different than any other job, due to their position in relation to class.

example.                                          value           what i should pay
box of antiques                                   80ish                    below 30
box of video games                                 40ish                  below 20
lot of magic cards                                  300ish             below 150
lego millennium falcon                            2000ish             below 1000

know what they sell for and stick to your guns when your bidding. Don't bid higher than what you promise yourself your going to buy it for and you'll guaranteed double your money. It just takes patience and research."

However, certain publications may have different in-house rules.

The reasoning behind journalists not citing sources has to do with the fact that journalists (traditionally) have a code of ethics they follow, which allows the reader to assume that the proper fact-checking has been done. Of course this isn't always true, so it's a little bit of a caveat emptor situation."

Being 5'4"" is no problem at all. There are tons of short officers, both men and women.

The only real problem may be the physical test. One of the most common things you will have to do is run and get over a wall that is six feet high. It's a lot harder the shorter you are, so start practicing that.

First thing first is that you take the written exam, the higher you score the more competitive you will be. If you pass that, then you do the physical test.

[Here is the most standard physical tests that I did](http://i.imgur.com/P7YbawP.png)

I have taken this exact test numerous times in multiple cities for becoming a police officer or sheriff deputy. I say that if you can do the things listed, then you will be fine everywhere. But make sure to practice. They always have a ""practice physical test day,"" make sure to attend that.

During the interview, if you carry yourself well, are in good shape, and answer all the questions with confidence, then you will be fine. 

Also apply EVERYWHERE. It is really competitive and there are hundreds if not thousands of people applying for each open spot. When you get rejected, don't get your hopes down. "

Guess what happened on my friends payday? He got up, went to work and left. He understood the parameters of him staying at my place and didnt push his luck. The only time he pushed my buttons was when he asked when is dinner as if hes my dependent or something. Granted I would've let him stay a day or two more had he asked but that was it.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1390618377.0,"Well first - talk to your doctor ASAP.  Any chest pain needs a professional opinion.

I have been having trouble with something similar, my chest feels tight and sore, like there is pressure on my chest.  It hasn't been severe or very painful, not like someone sitting on my chest, but definitely pressure.  Usually I have trouble when I've been using bad posture, shoulders rounded, chest collapsed, so I stretch my shoulders out and my ribs pop!  You know sometimes you have a good stretch and you feel that sort of pop-pop-pop-pop-pop up and down your spine and suddenly feel glorious and taller?  Like that, but around my sternum, and the pressure is gone and I feel much better.  I asked my doctor and the current theory is that I'm dealing with mild/partial/not-quite sublaxation of my ribs, likely just caused by extra relaxin.  

I'm managing it just fine with some simple stretching and yoga, but if it were worse I could also get relief from a chiropractor or massage therapist.  But you shouldn't seek either form of treatment or attempt to self-treat with yoga without talking to your doctor about it first.  It could be something different so you want to be cautious."

It's very possibly that the 'high' you and many others get is from heat exhaustion and dehydration. When you're working hard in heat, sweating a ton, and breathing heavily, your heart starts pumping hard and your blood pressure drops. Blood moves out to the skin to keep you cool, away from your muscles and brain.

All of a sudden, you come to rest in child's pose, your head is below your heart, you get a rush of blood and bam: high.

It can feel great in the moment, but all are signs that your body could be suffering from heat exhaustion and hyperthermia.

...or, you could have been having a really great time and felt amazing in the present moment. In which case, fantastic."

My father was an abusive jerk. He made me believe that I was no good and never deserved anything except a beating. Finally, in my 30's, with the help of a couple very good friends, I was able to get away from him and my entire family. I hated and resented him for a very long time, even after I moved away. It's really only in the past few years that I have been able to get over the things he said and did. I felt only relief when he died. 

Edited to add... this is my answer from an askreddit question that really illustrates just how wonderful he was:(Ironically, it's my most upvoted comment.)



The question was: Parents, can you tell if your child is ugly? If so, how did you deal with it? 

My answer: My parents, especially my dad, were never shy about telling me how ugly I was. Some gems:

You wearing makeup is like polishing a turd.

With a face like that you'd better be eager to please.

You'd better take the first boy who offers because there ain't gonna be another.

(not said to me, but about me) Yeah, I never woulda guessed my son would be the pretty one.

(after my first divorce, again not said to me but about me) Well, I guess we're stuck with her forever now. At least she can cook. 

Needless to say, my dad and I had other problems besides what he thought of my looks, and I'd be lying if I said it made me feel anything at all when I found out he was dead.

If you're under 35, born human female and work out then most guys would be interested in sexing you (obviously preference varies on a personal level, but as a population, this is generally what men want). A much larger % of the female population can pull this off.

I think you continue to be blinded by what you *want* to see. From my point of view as a lady, us chicks don't care about whether a guy is rich/influential/etc, although that's certainly a bonus. We have similar ""low"" standards that parallel your ""under 35 and work out"", which boil down to more ""under 35 and have a job"". 

Given the percentage of adults in the US who are obese or overweight, you're grossly overestimating if you think that ""under 35 and work out"" encompasses 55% of the female population."

So it seems to me that this guy was just staying at a private residence near the campus while he looked for other housing.

Also, the article mentions the victims' healing process and the trauma of running into the assaulter around town. Since, from the article, it appears this person was never convicted of a crime (just expelled by the school), do they have a right to demand this? I can't imagine how traumatizing it might be to see your assailant; however, at the end of the day, if he was not convicted of a crime, why shouldn't he have free range of the town as well? Maybe there's something about Amherst and its relationship with the town I don't know, though."

Also don't put quotes around something I didn't say. In addition , how can you seriously say I didn't make any points? Here are some points I made in my first post, since you were too dense to identify them:

1.) I said they rarely have guests, so saying Woody booking guests is a time consuming job is untrue.

2.) I pointed out that working out a time to do the show is just as much everyone else's job as it is Woody's.

3.) I said his topics aren't that interesting. While this is subjective, there is a bit of objectivity to it. People on the sub always bring up topics they want to hear, and he never addresses them. also, when he heard people didn't like tech talk, he didn't take it into consideration. He said something along the lines of ""if you don't read the comments they can't hurt you.""

4.) I said coming up with topics is something anything can do. Think about it; you come up with a few hypothetical questions, pick a few interesting news stories to talk about, and ask a few personal questions. I doubt the topic gathering process takes more than 10 minutes.

5.) I said that Wings shows up every week and puts in effort, so it isn't fair to call him a quest.

6.) I said that by your definition of a quest, Lefty and Kyle would also be guests.

To say that I made no points is insane.Kind of lame I had to restate all of them because you somehow seemed to miss them. And about the rendering, WINGS ALSO UPLOADS IT, on 1/3 the connection Woody has.

You also say I insulted Woody. Since you clearly don't know how to quote people, I'll quote myself:
""I love Woody, and I understand his contribution to the show. Without him the show would probably be 2 hours a week at best, and it wouldn't be as good of a show. Woody is an excellent speaker and does a good job of maintaining the flow.""

Is that your definition of insulting?
You're not a good arguer, as with every comment you address one of my points, whereas I address all of yours. I'm going to have to ask you this question for a third time; are Lefty and Kyle guests because Woody puts in more effort than him? I eagerly await your response."

My horse failed the flex test when I bought her... that was almost 10 years ago and she's never had any lameness other than abscesses (which of course couldn't possibly show up on a flex test).

That said, I would not buy a horse sight unseen unless I had a very good reason to do so (such as a rescue, where I don't care very much if it's sound or not).  Are there no closer horses that you can see in person?  Also consider the cost of hauling a horse 8 hours and shipping via ferry; it will be pretty expensive for you, most likely more than the purchase price of the horse himself."

No one chooses to be sad. If they are depressed, trying to 'cheer them up' doesn't work because life in and of itself is futile and there is no point to being happy nor is there anything to be happy about. 

Maybe they have nowhere else to talk about it and all they want is a friend to listen and sympathise, instead of a friend who tries to superficially cheer them up because their depression is bumming you out.  

I understand that because of your experiences with people who have taken their own lives, you believe that people with true depression wouldn't show it, but just like many other things, depression and other mental issues are a spectrum. It's possible to be depressed without being suicidal and it's possible to be visibly depressed and it's possible to not show depression. You can't decide whether or not people have depression based on how much they complain about it. "

Every place I work is good with the time outs.  I think they should be done with the patient awake, but rarely are.  The GI center where I work has the patient state what procedure we're doing, but getting the wrong end scoped isn't likely to cause too much long term disability.  The surgery centers where I work do time outs after the patient is anesthetized but before anybody cuts.

Daiteach,jakeandamir,1390619742.0,"From a comedy/entertainment standpoint, I think that firmer or more solid answers make for better radio. They get more comedy milage out of committing to things instead of prevaricating. I also feel like in a lot of situations where there is some gray area, they say something like ""You should probably break up with this person, or at least...""

From an actual advice-giving standpoint (and I think the advice that J&amp;A dispense does have non-comedy value), I think that giving somebody a lesser-commitment alternative to the best advice can make the advice worse. J&amp;A have substantially more life experience than the typical question-asker (the ones who identify their age or life situation are nearly always in high school or college), and are genuinely able to recognize disasters of relationships that a lot of their audience doesn't have the experience or perspective to recognize. But people in their late teens and early twenties in (what are clearly to somebody with more experience) lousy relationship situations often don't recognize just how hilariously bad their situation is. Even if they really should break up with the person, if you give them a more status-quo-preserving option, there's a good chance that they take that instead, when they really should just be breaking it off.

I'm the same age as Jake (so a bit younger than Amir), and when I think about the relationship situations that I and people I know put up with ten years ago in high school and college, I just want to go back in time so I can shake some sense into us... and the situations that are described in a lot of the e-mails are ten times worse."

Having said that though, I don't know why you feel like you have to ""do something"" about it. Does him watching gay porn make him less of a husband? A lover? A father? He's not broken and it's not something you need to ""fix,"" until it starts to get in the way of things.

The one thing that I do suggest is considering therapy for him. If his porn habits come from the fact that he was molested, then it's probably a painful thing for him manifesting into unhealthy behaviors, and he'll probably benefit from professional help. Otherwise, I think you're overreacting."

temp9876,BabyBumps,1390620387.0,"The great thing about asking ""What kind of mother are you?"" is that the answer changes depending on who you're telling the answer to.  

To my lovely, stay at home, cloth diapering, BF till preschool, crunchy granola and earth-mother-goddess mommy friends, I'm the ambitious, driven, working mom, happily, intentionally letting other people ""raise"" my children.  I don't want to stay home, can't be bothered with cloth diapers, would rather buy than make most things, let my kids roam the internet, watch more mature shows and movies and put no limits on what they can read.

To my lovely, working, driven, formula feeding, disposable everything, modern woman mommy friends, I'm the earth-mother-goddess mom.  I've got superboobs and I made my own babyfood, I babywear and cosleep, I'd rather go swimming than get mani-pedis and I have a home remedy for everything.

Funny thing is, despite the labels, I have friends on both sides of every debate and even if we don't agree on parenting choices, we support each other and respect each other's choices.

There are certainly crappy people out there, but I think sometimes it is as much the judgment we make of ourselves as the judgment of others that throws us.  I really like that this blog post acknowledges that she forged her own chains in some ways.  I love breastfeeding, I didn't have any problems, I enjoyed the experience and it was super convenient and cheap.  I think everyone should have that opportunity!  But not everyone can, and that's totally fine, I just hate the thought that any woman miss out because she didn't have the encouragement or support to (reasonably) make it work.  I know sometimes I probably come off as militant about breastfeeding, even without meaning to.  I know that in my attempt to be encouraging I have probably made someone feel judged and inadequate.  It's a difficult line to walk.  I would be the first to tell this blogger to grab the formula and give herself a break, I don't want anyone to go through that or feel like that.  So knowing that I must come off in ways I don't want to sometimes, I try to give everyone else the benefit of the doubt.

The result, after one baby and two kids, is that I tend to announce my shortcomings cheerfully, un-apologetically, and dare anyone to judge me.  I get some disapproving looks and attitudes occasionally, but nothing that could phase me.  People often aren't as judgy as we feel like.

mmmsoap,C25K,1390620495.0,"Hey! I am sadly on a break for the winter, because after my second bout of severe pneumonia in 1 year it became apparent that I just can't do this when its cold. **However**, I'm happy to dust out my stories of failure, if only to serve as an inspiration to others.

I started in May 2013 (after Pneumonia 1), and went to October 24th (the day I got Punemonia 2). That's right! That's about 20-ish weeks, and I made it to week 6!!

Before Pneumonia 1, I was a regular walker, and walking 3-5 miles was no big deal, but I was pretty sedentary other than that. I'm also pretty overweight. When I started, I did about 4 weeks of *pre*-Week 1 because jogging for one minute made me feel like I was going to vomit. And I was supposed to do this 8 times?

Week(s) 0 I started out with 15 seconds of jogging, followed by 60 seconds of walking (10 reps). Then I graduated to 30-60, then 45-90, and *finally* after a couple weeks of that, I made it to Week 1. I took Week 1 and I kicked its ass.

I needed two weeks in Week 2, but I finally kicked its ass too. Then I hit up Week 3. By this time it was early summer and quite pleasant out. Week 3 wasn't so bad, although I continued to huff and puff my way through. I wast starting to get a little cocky, thinking that this was going to be prett smooth sailing.

The jump to Week 4 was terrible, though. I did a Week 3.5 (where I did 4 reps of 3 min jogging), and *then* a Week 3.75 (upped it to 4 min each, the jump to 5 minutes was just too much for me.)

And then, huzzah, Week 4. In the beginning of August, middle of a heat wave. I took Week 4 and, well, I didn't kick its ass so much as we agreed to disagree. 5 minutes jogging? WTF is that about? But I did it, mostly because it was on the list, all the time refusing to believe that *most* people only need to do it for a single week.

And then Week 5, my nemesis. Week 5 starts all friendly-like, drawing you in with its 5-3-5-3-5 business, and you're all *I got this, it ain't so bad"". Little did I know that most of September and a chunk of October would be devoted to Week 5. I peeked ahead and saw the dreaded W5D3, so I took an entire week for just W5D2. And I did it! Not only did I jog 8 minutes, I did it twice!

Then on to W5D3. I lost count, but I posted about it on this forum....I think it took me 6 tries for *just* W5D3. I had to build (slowly) up from the 8 minutes to 20. I went from 8-5-8 to 9-4-8, then 10-3-10, then 15-2-5, etc, slowly building up to 20 minutes, trying to get shorter and shorter breaks between my jogs. In the process, I did much of Week 6, so I figured 6 was going to be easy when I finally got to it.

W6D2 I went out in a light rain, and 12 hours later was in the ER with pneumonia, so my progress has been halted. I've been on one jog since then; it got unseasonably warm (mid 50s) here a couple of weeks ago when the rest of the country was experiencing the polar vortex, and I went out and kicked Week 3's ass a bit. I am choosing to believe that my awesomeness has prevented me from backsliding to Week 0 again, as opposed to focusing on set backs. 

**TL;DR** I made 6 ""weeks"" of progress in about 6 months. You got this!"

One thing I had a problem with was rejection. He put it into perspective for me like this: Do you think that every woman you hit on/ask out/try to sleep with is going to do it? No. It doesn't happen that way for anyone. So you have that expectation. You're going to get shot down. Don't be embarrassed, but learn from your mistakes.  

Another lesson he taught me, was that you can essentially say anything to anyone, if said in the correct way.  
You could have used that same line in a different tone and adding a few words to it, and she would have laughed.  
Or she's a pretentious bitch who gives dudes lap dances and gets offended when you ask how she learned to rub her ass on a dude like a stripper. Oh well, a girl whos willing to do that before she really knows you wasn't really worth pursuing anyways unless it was just a piece of ass, and at that rate, there will be many more opportunities for that.

Avistew,sex,1390620931.0,"She seems very insecure. She also seems to have wrong ideas about men. In her mind, apparently, men are always up for sex, so when you rejected her twice in the same day, she figured you were cheating.

There are definitely problems in communicating: from your post here it seems you told her in the morning ""I can't in the morning, I'll make it up to you later"" then you went to take a shower (often a sign for ""we're about to have sex""), and to bed, wanting a nap to rest before having sex with her... but you didn't tell her that so she had already worked up herself thinking that finally, she was getting the sex she'd been waiting for all day...

The rejection was probably hard for her in the morning, since it seems she's not used to it, and so she really wanted you to be into it once you were home so she could feel better about being rejected. By not letting her know ""hey I'm gonna take a shower and a nap, then I'd like to spend time with you... but I'm too tired right now. Wake me up in (so many hours)... You can wake me up however you want"" then not only would she had known you wanted to have sex, not felt misled when you rejected her at the last second after her hopes got high, but you could have made the whole thing sexy in its own right with her deciding how to wake you up with sex, etc.

Now, of course you can't go back in time and change it, and I'm not saying you were completely wrong and she was completely right - you seem more right than wrong, but you lack the one big thing of realising that whatever stresses your out, makes you tired and so on, if you don't talk to her about it (whether you want to spare her or whatever), well you're pretty much hiding it from her, because you guys are in a relationship where you were considering marriage, and she's the one person you should absolutely be talking about this kind of things.

So her lack of trust, while a huge over-reaction here, isn't completely out of the blue like you seem to think. You did hide things from her. You did decide not to give her details or explanations, not to keep her in the loop, whether it is because you thought it wasn't important or you'd tell her later. But the point is that at this point, she feels like you pushed her away.

Because she cares a lot about you, she's panicking, and as a result is pushing YOU away (you wanted to propose, and now you rightly aren't so sure anymore). She's trying to keep you in her life. She's clumsy about it, and crazy about it, but she feels justified because you're the one who's been neglecting her and keeping her out of the loop (from her point of view).

Now I get that wanting to propose isn't something that you wanted her to know as this kind of thing is a surprise. But either way, here is my suggestion.

Tell her you want to have a serious talk with her. Sit down, and start by saying you're sorry you've made her feel neglected and left out. That you were working extra hard because you want the two of you to be stable financially (no need to say ""so I could propose to you""). That you should have told her and kept her in the loop of everything.

That you are not cheating on her, but that spying on each other in a relationship is destructive, and that you want to rebuild trust in a healthier way, by being there for her and making her see that she can count on you. That her wanting to spy on you made you feel disrespected even though you have nothing to hide, because it was a lack of trust in her part, and you want her to trust you, but you also want to feel like equals in the relationship, and her spying on you makes you feel like you're under her, and spying on each other is just unhealthy.

Ask her how you can work things out together. Tell her how long your project will take, and plan a big date together afterwards. Make plans for the days off you have and be careful about keeping her in the loop with work. Tell her you don't want to push sex, but you love her and want to at least hug and kiss, and you hope you can have sex together again at some point, but you understand that if she doesn't trust you, it's harder to trust you for having sex, too (you're inside of her, she's making herself vulnerable to you, etc. Believe me, very difficult to be willing to have sex with a guy you don't trust, regardless of how much you love him).

Then make sure the situation is cleared out, that you both learned from it, that you're healthier than ever. Get financially stable by working together at it. And then, re-evaluate whether you will work as a married couple. If so, propose. But only after the problems have been solved and some time has passed without other big issues arising.

Good luck.

By the way, I don't think she's cheating  on you, and distrusting her won't help anything. That's exactly what she did wrong. She suspected, had no way to prove it, panicked and became very unreasonable with her demands. Don't make the same mistakes. Trust her. Rebuild trust together. Don't go through her stuff. Show you respect her privacy and expect the same respect from her."

If he needs more reasoning, you should tell him that the people who text you might be sharing secrets they would not be comfortable sharing with him, for instance girl stuff (if you're female), and that he would be causing a breach of trust: him reading the secret over your shoulder is similar to you repeating a secret you were asked not to, but you're not even given a say here.

pamplemus,TwoXChromosomes,1390621791.0,"these comments disgust me. i feel like everyone here is insane. this is not some random girl walking down the street. this is a model that was carefully picked by a company to represent their brand. they deliberately decided to very dangerously pick an extremely thin model as the type of person their would-be customers should aspire to. so when the ad is critiqued, we're not body-shaming the model; we're attacking the company for making such a dumb decision.

also, can i just say - HOLY SHIT, THE DOUBLE STANDARDS! i remember when someone posted an article about a plus-size line using obese women as their models and everyone freaked the fuck out about how irresponsible it was of the company to be promoting such an unhealthy weight, how girls shouldn't grow up thinking that being fat is okay, that maybe plus-size women shouldn't be in ads so as to avoid promoting obesity. whereas here you have someone at a body weight that is basically unachievable for most people (and if it can be achieved, it can only be done in a very unhealthy manner), and everyone's sooo offended that her weight is even an issue! ""maybe she's just naturally thin! you're not her doctor; you can't tell if she's healthy or not! i have so many thin friends who eat 50 burgers a day but just can't gain weight!""

Avistew,AskMen,1390621797.0,"He could be bisexual (you have kids, does it seem like he's not attracted to you when you have sex? Do you have any reasons to think he's not attracted to women?) although there are definitely men who watch porn between men without having any desire or ever doing it. Some just like the ""taboo"" aspect of it, apparently.

Although yes, most of the time, people watch porn because they're sexually attracted to the people in it. Is it the only porn he watches, or the one he mostly watches? Does he never watch anything with females in it?

Honestly... it's my opinion as a female and I know you ask for men's opinions so I understand if you don't really care about mine, but in your position I would probably leave him alone. The porn he watches, in itself, isn't really my business, and it doesn't seem that your sexual or romantic life is affected here.

It might help him to see someone about being molested, but you know what? If watching that kind of porn is how he copes, well good for him. Many victims of abuse cope by committing abuse instead. He watches consensual porn and imagine it's abuse (""getting damaged"") and comparatively, that's really healthy and mature of him because nobody gets hurt, and it helps him deal with what happened to him as a boy.

Now, this being said, you did say ""teen"". If they're young enough that it's illegal, (18 and 19 are still teens, so it's unclear from just that word) then that's scarier. I think you should address that part. Just let him know that you want to support him and you love him, but if teenagers are actually getting taken advantage of in the process, that's wrong.

Definitely support him about sharing his experience as being abused with you. These things are difficult to talk about and the last thing you want is making him feel like you're judging him for it. But he needs to refrain from hurting other kids, even indirectly (consuming porn that was produced by abusing them).

I'm worried about the ""I don't have anybody"" part of your post. It's important to have friends and family to support you as you support him. I hope you will find people to help as it's not easy being alone, especially since you're raising kids and that must be exhausting."

postExistence,GirlGamers,1390622294.0,"&gt;We prove that Nerds and Geeks aren't just smart, they are beautiful, powerful and SEXY!!!

I'm having a hard time accepting this premise. How does the presence of attractive female geeks empower lesser confident female geeks? Additionally, won't this just reinforce the ""hot geek girl"" imagine men have of women, putting them on *higher* pedestals they never wanted to stand on?

&gt;""The problem with saying this is degrading is that you are once again telling a woman that she needs to be afraid of her sexuality.""

I've always believed the usage of scantily clad women in gaming media is degrading because it exploits the male gaze and objectifies women. I never thought it was telling the women to be ashamed of their sexuality, I thought it was telling women that their sexuality is all they are, and that the purpose of applying feminism in geek culture is to tell everyone that women are more than their sexuality.

Sure, Geek Goddess has these women on the forums and members can talk with them, so the models can let these guys know that they are normal people with real lives and are indeed more than their sexuality. But to get that opportunity, one must get through a $10/month paywall. It seems disingenuous, and it's the one thing male geeks hate the most: women asking for money in exchange for the opportunity to talk with them.

TheIcelandicPuffin,travel,1390623065.0,"* I'm personally in favor of the summer. I love camping and travelling without wearing tons of clothing, it's not as cold as you might think it is, but like we say in Iceland, ""There is no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing"". However Northern Lights are not visible during the summers since it's bright 24/7.

*  I always recommend the Southern Region, it's by far my favourite since it has everything (activities, nature, hot pools, etc), with only 5 locations, those 5 would be in the Southern Region. You can see glaciers, waterfalls, snorkeling, caves, stunning nature, hot pool etc. 

* It's not difficult, I think it's around $40 a day, perhaps less, just order with good advance. =)

* Just be careful, Iceland isn't dangerous if you're aware of the environment (e.g. don't ""peak"" down cliffs, there have been way to many tourist deaths last few years due to not following directions), plan in advance since it will save you plenty of time and money. There are about 1,000,000 tourist each year (at least) so you'll never be able to avoid tourism.

temp9876,relationship_advice,1390623114.0,"Well I'm going to look at this from a different perspective.  You aren't living together, so the only way he's reading over your shoulder is if you're spending time together.  So while you're spending time with him, you're carrying on conversations with other people, and since you're having that conversation while spending time with him, he feels entitled to be involved with the conversation.  

To put it in another format, imagine you're out at a coffee shop or a bar, kinda hanging out together, and someone starts talking to him.  You're there with him, do you feel that it would be out of line for you to listen in or even join that conversation?  If he excluded you from that conversation would you not feel that you were being ignored?

Perhaps rather than complaining that he's reading over your shoulder you need to set better limits on together time and personal time.  If you were focused on him during your together time there would be no texting for him to read, and when you have your personal time and text he won't be hanging around reading over your shoulders.

A better system would to be to have machines that scan and send directly to your recipient just like a fax would, but purely as a digital copy.

For instance, friends + sex without romantic feelings = Friends with Benefits, while Friends + romantic feelings without sex could be either an asexual relaitonship or a non-confessed friendship.

Either way, I would say that to me, in the ideal relationship, your partner would have to also be your friend. I would not want to date someone who isn't my friend. So, when you say ""I don't even know if I look at her as a girlfriend or a friend."" I'm thinking... why does it have to be one or the other? She's obviously both, and that's ideal!"

It isn't weird because most of the wives I know buy their husband's undies.  If your spouse is predictible about their underwear brand/size/preferences there is absolutely no reason not to go for it.

But be honest, do you feel odd at all when you do it?  I can buy boxers in a department store but VS stores are all ladies everywhere with boudoir decor, and people in there can get really weird about men being in the store.  You'd think my husband helping me pick out a swimsuit was positively indecent.  I sort of enjoy making people uncomfortable but I know he gets shy, so I'm just curious about your experience.

Meanwhile other brothers ex wife was also type 1 (btw are you like guarenteed pre e?) And stayed borderline until about 38 weeks when she gave birth naturally. 

So theres that scenario too.

Id like to note that no, my brothers do not have a thing for type 1 diabetics. I just have a LOT of brothers.  Thus, I havr a LOT of sister in laws and a good handful of ex sister in laws."

For me, eyeshadow primer is to prevent creasing (where it all balls up in a line going across your eyelid). If you're trying to really make your eyeshadow pop I'd suggest using a base. NYX milk as shown in this thread [here](http://redd.it/1uu06b) or something like Fyrinnae's pixie epoxy/Darling Girl's Glitter glue (basically the same thing except DG GG works with mattes &amp; is supposed to be better at blending, haven't personally tried it myself since I still have lots of PE left) and you can see how it works [here](http://imgur.com/a/3xLYf). 

About making eyeshadow pop, there are honestly a lot of things to eyeshadow that may ""pop."" I'm not sure if you're talking about pigmentation (which I addressed in the last paragraph), color, finish, duochrome, etc. I'd suggest being a bit more specific so we can better help you.

You want good extraction from your grounds, so you hot enough water. Coffee makers with the hot plates tend to split their power between hot water and hotplate, counting on the coffee warming further in the pot. By this point, its too late! As well, the cone shaped filters lend themselves to more even extraction, so you wont pull as much oil(bitterness) from the beans. 

Also, don't skimp on the grounds because you think it will make the coffee milder. Often this just causes over extraction, again pulling more oils from the beans and making the coffee more bitter.

What kind of heretic are you? I'm primarily going to use the Word of God, even the Holy Scripture. As an aside, what a terrible way to live, not learning anything because it ""might be false"" later.

Temporal does often mean mortal, in an LDS sense. See:

""final state of the soul after the death of the temporal body: 1 Ne. 15:31""

""by the temporal law they were cut off: 2 Ne. 2:5""

""stand in need, both spiritual and temporal: Alma 7:23""

""fall had brought … spiritual death as well as a temporal: Alma 42:9""

""created I them; yea, all things both spiritual and temporal: D&amp;C 29:31""

""office of a bishop is in administering all temporal things: D&amp;C 107:68""

Replace ""temporal"" with ""mortal"" in any of these scriptures and the meaning is the same.

Now, let's move to D&amp;C 76:
&gt;earth during … its **mortal** existence

Clearly, Earth's temporal existence *is* it's mortal existence.

Further, there was no death before the Fall. 

&gt;if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. (2 Nephi 2:22)

From the 2010 Gospel Principles manual, page 28:

&gt;When Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden of Eden, they were not yet mortal. In this state, “they would have had no children” (2 Nephi 2:23). There was no death. They had physical life because their spirits were housed in physical bodies made from the dust of the earth (see Moses 6:59; Abraham 5:7). They had spiritual life because they were in the presence of God. They had not yet made a choice between good and evil.

Finally, from the LDS Bible Dictionary:

&gt;Latter-day revelation teaches that there was no death on this earth for any forms of life before the fall of Adam. Indeed, death entered the world as a direct result of the fall (2 Nephi 2:22 ; Moses 6:48 ).

So, there you have it. The Earth is 7,000 years old (give or take), and there was no death before the Fall of Adam, which was also about 7,000 years ago. Which of course will come to the Sumerians, or the Aborigines of Australia, or the nomads in Mongolia. Also, no Evolution, no geology, and most of modern science has it's head up it's ass.

Thanks, God!"

I think if this friend had not joined you it is pretty likely that you would have been disappointed in how the trip went.  I don't think it would have been anything like the ""first and only"" vacation you were imagining.  But if you re-purpose it in your mind you can still have a great time of it.

Make your own plans!  Don't try to tag along, go off on your own and get in some good you time.  Go shopping, enjoy the food, spend the afternoons at the pool, and meet up with everyone now and then for a show or sightseeing, something that you will enjoy.  They can spend money at the casino, you're going to the spa!  Set some ground rules, exempt yourself from dealing with drunken shinannigans.  There will be no designated driving, bailing people out, or cleaning up vomit for you.  Reach out to some of the extended family to see if anyone is more keen on sightseeing than drinking and gambling and don't worry about following the group.

If I have learned anything about vacations it is that family vacations are never going to live up to your expectations.  It is what it is.  When you finally take a vacation together after the baby and it is just the two of you it will be absolutely glorious, a completely different beast than even the best family vacation.  So enjoy this trip for what it is, it can still be a great time."

ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1390626221.0,"I enjoy many of the classics, because I enjoy reading. And I agree - many of them are *absolute shit* that are only around because we fetishize certain cultures while ignoring that, in truth, they were human - violent, naive, occasionally clever humans. We still have people reading Aristotle despite the fact that virtually everything he ever wrote has been discredited by either empirical evidence or better arguments.

I think the author, in many ways, equates intellectualism to a very outdated educational mode. People in past times weren't smarter - they were better at some things and worse at others. The ancient Egyptians had better archers than we do, and I'd say the 16/17th century Europeans had better geometers than us. Then we invented guns and topology and that mode of information became obsolete. The classics are by and large obsolete. We may be holding onto them because they're good stories, but do we teach all the old ideas or the new ones? The analytic geometry proofs, or the calculus ones? How to build a bridge the Roman way, or the 21st century way? The same applies to art. Why should we deify these particular works? The classics were written not to be classics but to be good stories, and we should think of them as stories and approach them as stories - no different than a ten year old book."

JTfromOKC,explainlikeimfive,1390626511.0,"Because of my generation, gen-X.

We've grown up seeing how the war on drugs has done nothing to slow down the drug use amongst the population.  We know, many of us from our college years, that drugs are easy to get, fun and many times they're much less harmful than we were previously taught to believe they were.  Yes they drugs can destroy people's lives but we also see that alcohol and cigarettes do the same or worse.  In short, we realize we were lied to on a number of occasions.

We recognize the hypocrisy in all this and many of us miss those care free, pot filled days of our youth.  We also now have plenty of evidence that pot can have huge medical benefits.

We're also increasingly moving into positions of influence and I'm not even talking about local, state or federal levels of offices.  I'm talking about within our own social circles and families.  We're moving or have already moved into middle life and are increasing influencing ideas in our families, jobs, community, etc.  

Couple all of this with the parallels between alcohol prohibition of the early 20th century, the access to an immense amount of information that was previously unheard of and numerous stories about the effects our draconian laws have on real people's lives and it all just becomes too much to withstand.

I live in Oklahoma and back when I was growing up, access to information about the rest of the country was difficult to come by and it was extremely difficult to find a diversity of sources.  This lead many to simply ""go along"" with what others said because the ways that one could independently verify data and/or research alternate ideas was quite limited.  All of this has changed with the internet.

TL;DR - The internet + gen-x + the history of alcohol prohibition = pot legalization at the Federal level by no later than Dec 2015."

When you treat junk food as a reward or special-occasion-only kind of thing, it gets embedded in the brain's reward pathway. If doing good = good, happy feelings, and doing good *also* = junk food reward, after a while junk food = good, happy feelings and people start eating junk food to get the good, happy feelings without doing the good work to deserve it first. It's similar to how people become so addicted to cigarettes. With cigarettes, the problem really isn't the physical addiction. The bigger, more important problem is that smokers train themselves things like cigarette = relaxation (for people who smoke during breaks or immediately after work) or cigarette = fun (for people who start smoking only in social smoking situations). This is why the idea of rewarding children for doing chores or homework or etc with candy is frowned upon by psychologists.

However, what you're doing is not relevant to that. Good on you. Teaching your son to have one or the other, not both, is healthy. Teaching him he will be more likely to get what he wants if he isn't a whiney bitch about it is healthy."

Obviously it wouldn't work right now, with, you know, only two; but they could bring back a featured mode every weekend, or something. Once there're more, they could simply be part of the same rotation system as free champions or something. Or they could be actually every week, swapping out on a set day... or they could go for two weeks... or whatever.

As far as your arguments regarding ""stretching out the player base"", I don't buy it. All of these modes seem to me to be sort of *just for fun*, and if that's not the intent it certainly *could* be; there's no reason Riot couldn't just leave them as-is and *not* try to balance around them. They **definitely** don't balance around ARAM, and I'm given to understand they don't really balance around Dominion or 3v3 either. How would adding more modes that were understood to be not perfectly balanced be any different?

And it's *absurd* to claim that adding new modes like that would increase queue times in for players at the *top* of the ranking system. Those are the people who care most about competitive play! They're the *likeliest* to stick with SR and its ladder system no matter what.

&gt;Fire At Will: 
Resolved an issue that was incorrectly disabling Power Drain on all non-Phaser types of energy weapons.
Resolved an issue that was causing Fire At Will to drain power for only a single activation pulse, instead of over the entire firing cycle. 
This was causing it to appear, for certain well-geared ships, as though no power was being drained, when it was actually just regenerating very quickly.
This fix now causes the Energy Drain to behave the same as a standard Beam firing cycle - it remains drained for all 5 firing pulses, then returns after the weapon stops firing.


&gt;Is FAW still the best tool in the DPs toolkit?

Er... kinda... but no  for a  week or so more.  Once they fix crits, especially with some of the new + crit stuff (spire consoles and dyson rep stuff) then it should be solidly in back to yes.  With a caveat.  It seems like the new  proton weapon and  gravametric torpedo and the console provide interesting buffs to crit chance and severity for all weapons.  So we'll have to test them  out once FAW works properly to see if they're worth it or not.  I suppose I could do the math and check, but that requires a minimum of effort.  "

Willravel,startrek,1390630255.0,"*Into Darkness* was just another attempt to use the great mystery marketing device, the same one we've seen a million times before. The problem is that the reveal is that Harrison—who we were assured wasn't Khan and were even spoken down to by the cast and JJ about—turned out to be a hollow, meaningless, needlessly whitewashed version of a classic villain that had already been done right. This all would have been bad enough on its own, but the simple fact of the matter is that this is a Star Trek movie, Star Trek traditionally being about exploring issues, solid characters, fun plots, and living out a progressive utopia fantasy. 

But that was really just the start. Spock agreed to violate the Prime Directive using a cold fusion device to stop an active volcano (wtf), then, as the Enterprise came out from being under water (wtf), Kirk saved him, reported Kirk for violating the Prime Directive, all to create friction between characters that were never actually established as friends. No, really. All we got in the 2009 film was Kirk and Spock stopped fighting so they could stop the Narada. We never saw them as friends, so Spock's 'betrayal' was largely meaningless... and the relationship between these two is at the center of the movie. The parallels with Spock's relationship with Uhura are basically the same problem, that we don't understand the relationship, so the friction and then Spock's reveal about how he cares about them—again, the emotional core of the movie—ring entirely hollow. 

But it gets worse. The story of the movie is that Kirk loses his command because he's an irresponsible guy, and has to learn to be responsible and take responsibility and such in order to live up to the spectre of the real Kirk (Shatner), proving himself worthy of being captain of the Enterprise by defeating an enemy with superior firepower and not entirely clear motives while also getting spoilers from old Spock. Yep, *Into Darkness* is just as much a remake as *Star Trek* (2009) as it is *Wrath of Kahn*. 

Delving into the plot itself, which seems to be that Marcus awoke Khan, and blackmailed him into developing Starfleet weapons tech in exchange for not hurting the other Augments, but then Khan escapes (?) and seeks revenge in order to get the Enterprise to bring the Augments in torpedoes to Qo'noS, where Khan somehow beamed, but Marcus actually wants to kill Khan by shooting the Augments at him in their torpedoes, and has been building a war machine with which to fight the Klingons in a war of aggression, and he wants Kirk to die to cover up the Augments/Khan thing. That's what we in the business call bad writing. Say, what was the story of Wrath of Khan again? Oh, right, Khan, the Augment, wants revenge on Kirk for abandoning him and his people and forgetting about them, so they take a Federation ship and go after Kirk. Yes, there's the Genesis B-plot, but that actually ends up winding into the Khan story well. 

This Khan is just needlessly violent and kinda cares about people we never see and don't understand. BTW, for someone who hasn't seen tons of Trek and goes in to see *Into Darkness*, what do you think they might think an Augment is? There's no explanation of the Eugenics Wars or the Third World War, very little about Botany Bay, even. 

And that's part of a central issue with both of these movies: they heavily reference Star Trek while getting very serious core parts of canon completely wrong and screwing up basic facts. I get that Spock came back with warp beaming, but beaming from Earth to Qo'noS means starships are done, just like was predicted in Enterprise episode ""Daedalus"". If Khan can beam to Qo'noS, Kirk, Uhura, and Spock can beam to Qo'noS. And building giant ships makes no sense, because Klingons can beam directly to Earth. Cold fusion is a largely debunked theoretical process by which fusion could be achieved at around room temperature, it's not a machine that makes cold. The Enterprise should never be under water because it's a spacecraft with transporters. That volcano wasn't going to destroy the planet (just like, in the previous film, a supernova isn't capable of FTL). How did Kirk contact Scotty back on Earth from Qo'noS? Why is there an android on the bridge of the Enterprise? 

But, you know what? I might have been willing to look past all of that. I mean, I looked past a ton of serious faults in *Star Trek* (2009) and ultimately enjoyed the movie for what it was. But no, the ending of *Into Darkness* felt like it was purpose-built as a very clear, very intentional insult to all Star Trek fans. Arguably one of the most important scenes in all of Star Trek, movies and TV alike, is the death of Spock in *Wrath of Khan*. We'd spent three seasons and two movies coming to understand and appreciate Spock, and the wonderful friendship that had grown for years between Spock and Kirk. They'd become like brothers, and then Spock sacrificed himself to save Kirk and the crew. They had the amazing scene we've all seen a thousand times, Spock dies, and we're all left shocked. *Into Darkness* takes two characters who aren't friends, swaps them in the situation, has Spock suddenly shout Khan for absolutely no reason, but the worst of it is Kirk doesn't even die, and it's the cheapest death cheat I've ever seen. 

Imagine, if you will, some hotshot director like Zach Snyder was given the task of remaking TNG. The first movie is fine enough, but the second movie is a rehash of ""Best of Both Worlds"", but Riker is taken instead of Picard, and Geordi uses tachyons to remove all of Riker's Borg implants before the Battle of Wolf 359. Riker doesn't feel guilty or get PTSD, Picard never gets the growth opportunity, and the whole situation is completely robbed of its sense of loss and desperation. 

Imagine, if you will, Len Wiseman is given the task of remaking DS9. The first movie works, but the second movie is ""In the Pale Moonlight"". Instead of Sisko, Rom accidentally finds a real data rod of the Dominion planning an invasion of Romulus, so Sisko contacts Senator Vreenack and gives him the rod. The Romulans enter the war, and Vreenack thanks Sisko. 

*Star Trek Into Darkness* has actually convinced me that there's such a thing as an objectively bad movie. "

But yeah, with the social pressures it can be devastating and drive you to drink.  It took me a couple months to be able to hang out and not drink. I would cover with things like tonic and lime, which you can pass off as a drink- just keep it full so others don't buy you a round.  Or tell them that you are flying high with pills and you don't want to mix it/save your liver. That will sometimes work as a cover. Otherwise, it really does just kill your social life. For me, I'm a hermit when I don't drink so I opted out of the social scene without much difficulty; for others I would recommend a support structure.

eighthgear,Warthunder,1390631855.0,"I'd say very resistant. Jet engines can easily take such fire and keep on operating, and it isn't like designers have abandoned self-sealing fuel tanks.

Remember, WWII fighters were pretty damn resistant to small arms fire as well. That is why fighter designers began to mount larger calibre weapons on aircraft. The definition of ""small arms"" can be fuzzy, but in the US, it is legally defined as firearms with a bore diameter of a .50 calibre round (so, 12.7mm) or less. A lot of people will exclude .50 calibre machine guns from the ""small arms"" category, though, since, when used on the ground, they are operated by a crew as opposed to an individual.

Cannon rounds can definitely take down a modern jet, which is why modern jets have cannons (generally between 20mm and 30mm). Still, one would likely have to put multiple rounds in the enemy aircraft to take it down.

You'd be surprised how tough modern fighters are. Yeah, ideally they shouldn't be hit, but they are definitely designed to be able to take hits. A direct hit by a large SAM will take a fighter down, but there are instances of fighters surviving either SAMs that didn't detonate, or SAMs that detonated nearby the aircraft. There are also instances of fighters surviving MANPADS and landing.

According to Wikipedia, the only armoured fixed-wing aircraft in production are the Sukhoi SU-25 and the SU-34. The SU-25 Frogfoot isn't a fighter, but a ground-attack aircraft, and is quite legendary when it comes to toughness. I've read that SU-25s survived stinger missile hits during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, and were able to return to their base, and there [is this SU-25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxAmRrdDOuk) that supposedly survived a MANPADS hit during the Russian operation in Georgia. The SU-34 Fullback is a very new fighter-bomber, which apparently makes use of an armoured crew cabin. "

LolaRuns,gamingsuggestions,1390632602.0,"(RPGs) Dragon Age Origins is a semi-recent RPG that is really popular among female gamers despite being a grimdark game. I was surprised how well it ran on my previous lapops, but if Oblivion is the highest hers can go you might want to do some research. If it doesn't run you might want to check out the previous games from Bioware, more notably Knight Of The Old Republic 1 and 2 (set in the star wars universe, but RPGs, again with choices and romance options) or if you want to go full on retro Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 Enchanced Edition (isometric art style). There's also Puzzle Quest (the first one) which is a surprisingly fun mix between RPG and Match3. 

(Adventure) The Dark Eye Chains of Satinav is a point and click adventure game by deadalic that it set in a fantasy universe (specifically the Dark Eye universe). =&gt; I've only played the German version so I don't know how good the English voices are, but from that I remember TotalBiscuit reviewed it favorably, his only complaint was some niggling about the art style. If she has never played a Monkey Island game, they have re-released the first 2 with updated graphics and Broken Age is the new traditional adventure game from Tim Schäfer that got really great reviews. 

If you are willing to go casual but want a grown up tone, the Mystery Case Files (I believe particlarly Dire Grove and Return to Ravenhearst) are fairly popular. I also enjoyed the two Enigmatis games (where the second one Mist of Ravenwood imo is much superior ot the first one, but the first one is kinda needed to understand the second one). =&gt; all the casual games usually have demos out (and run on pretty much anything), so just show them to her and see whether she can live with this gameplay style. 

(Other) Dust An Elysian Tail is a 2d left to right action game with a beautiful cartoon-y artstyle with antropomorphic animals but a fairly serious story (there are a lot of exposition conversation though, first research the game to see whether it would be for her). She might also enjoy Reus which is a light God game. She might also have fun with a little Roguelike, like Dungeons of Dredmore or FTL. Sim City 4 might run on her old rig, even if the one I really wanted to recommend, Civilization 5 probably won't. 

Trine 2 is a puzzle game with a very beautifuly storybook style art style, it can be played in co-op, but imo it plays best with a controller. 

If you want to do something wow like again, my cousin and her boyfriend used to play WoW and recently looked for a game again, they ended up setting on Neverwinter because they found that the most compatible with their schedules. You could also look into Torchlight 2 which is a diablo style hack and slash (again, can be played together), I read good stuff about this going over well with girlfriends/wives because of the art style (if the art stlye is too light for her, you can alternatively try Path of Exile or Adventures of Van Helsing).

I used to order it through Walgreens and they send it to the house well packaged with dry ice.  Never had an issue with temperatures.  The cost savings for me were just not enough to keep doing it since I was going to the pharmacy for other items throughout the month anyway.  Your case might be different though, and you should definitely check into it.

Another thing that you may want to consider sometime is an insulin pump.  That will get you off the Lantus completely and you will only be purchasing vials of Humalog/Novalog.  The upsides to a pump are incredible.  The freedom from taking constant shots is amazing.  The downside is that the pump is pretty expensive and so are the pumping supplies such as the infusion sets and vials.  Might be worth checking with your insurance about though.  Mine will pay to purchase a new pump every 4 years.  Mine also pays 80% of my pumping supplies.  Yours may be completely different.

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390633390.0,"My personal take on this is that the case about promoting sexuality and self confidence would be more believable if it/the site was free. [I'm not expert, but isn't or wasn't that the point of [Suicide Girls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuicideGirls)?]

There is nothing wrong with taking money for taking your clothes off, it's a job like any other, to me it it's unrelated, it affects feminism neither negatively nor positively. Of course you can take your clothes off for work and still be a feminist, but I don't see why the act of taking money for showing off your body should be any more feminist than taking money for working in retail or being a programmer or being a CEO or being a cleaning lady (aka all these things are great and feminist, cuz money = freedom, your body just like your brain or your hands is your natural resource, there is no difference). 

To give an example, if I made video tutorials about programming because I love programming and I want to promote programming to other people I would make them free on youtube and if I instead put them on a paywall site it would be something different, aka a job/service. [and yes there's even a difference between free+make money off ads vs. paywall]. It's not a question of things related to sex being immoral, but of paywalls imo being kind of counter the idea of lovinging promoting something you think is great/something you believe in/something you think the world should have more of. If you successfully put things behind a paywall I can still admire you for being a great business woman but again, I don't get why the act of putting something presumably great behind a paywall in itself should be considered great/any greater than any other job. 

=&gt; let's take TB for example. He's a very famous/successfull youtuber, who is often excessively defensive of his right to make money off of it. But when he made a video about the lack of relation between video game violence and school shootings where he lambasted traditional media, he intentionally and deliberately made it non-monetized. Because the subject matter was that serious/important and he didn't want to make money off link baiting/real life tragedy or be seen as doing that. Yes taking money for something can be seen as a traditionally feminist thing, but in a capitalistic world deliberately not taking money for something is a powerful statement that emphasizes your point. 

Don't get me wrong, if they are genuine about promoting a more realistic/personal view between the models and the fans, great, sounds like a pretty interesting idea (though I think a lot of non geek themed porn sites offer that as well these days), but again, it seems like a more useful service for the men if they get a chance to talk to the models in person and it's pretty hard to say how much of that interaction would really exist and work in the same way if the woman wasn't getting paid, so can you truly say that it's gonna paint a realistic picture of what you might come across in the wild? 

I can see the feminism in running your own business and even in providing a safe space for your female models (aka stuff like ensure that they get paid well/get health insurance/get advice when they get harassed [which in their interest I hope they do, nothing is more hypocritical than saying big things about feminisn and treating female employees like crap for example by paying them below standard wages) but having an effect on overall geekery? It seems like just one facet to me. Real life isn't as easy as Virgin/Whore and neither people who go for the publicly perceived Virgin or the publicly perceived Whore route necessarily do so just because society made them that way, different people are just wired differently. (let's say you are wired in a way that for you sex is the most fun when it's with a longterm partner who knows your preferences =&gt; you aren't choosing to be monogamous and ""in the privacy of my own home"" because evil patriarchy wants that, you do that because it's the most practical/pleasurable for you, same if you have an exhibitionist streak, you are doing it because it's the most practical/pleasurable for you. But the ""in the privacy of my own home"" person can't speak for the exhibitionist or vice versa and can authoritatively say that their road is ""the right one"" and that the other one is inferior. Each one of them is just part of the picture. And honestly it seems like whatever they say, the picture they present on their site is still fairly narrow and curated in addition to that picture only being available to those who pay. "

It's your first time, and the probabilities that you know how her body works well enough to help her reach climax are slim while having sex. Now, I know it doesn't have to be the goal of sex, and that it's way more important to have fun and a good time. But, eating her out before penetration will increase your chances of helping her reach climax, and once she's done that one time, she will...

* ... Have an easier time reaching it a second time once penetration starts (really depends of course - some cannot reach it during penetration and that's OK too, if you make sure to eat (and of course if you make sure to never give up :))).
* ... Be more fully dilated (if your size might cause discomfort).
* ... Definitely be hot and lubricated enough for smooth penetration.

Also. Cunnilingus is fucking awesome :D Would highly recommend. Best place to focus on would be right below her clitoris and above her opening. If she starts moving - don't move with her, she knows what she's doing.

You do get lockscreen toggles and lock screen weather and a Jellylock like unlock mechanism. My gripe isn't about whether or not it does those things but about how it does it and whether its got a ""damn, this tweak is awesome!"" factor to it.

I pre-ordered it to try it out because it was $2 (that's the minimum payable) last week.

I paid, added the repo and installed the tweak. *Immediately* upon respringing I felt that it didn't have that wow factor to it. All if did was add switches and weather to the lockscreen and make you swipe up to unlock. Sure it'll have themes for it one day when it's released but $2 for that wasn't worth to me.

I know that now this just sounds like *I* hyped up my dislike of the tweak but hey. It *was* my worst purchase. 

After all this though, I really do appreciate the fact that the dev didn't even think twice about accepting my refund request. With that in mind, I know that if he ever released another tweak, I won't hesitate to give it a shot.

Don't get held back by my words though if you did intend to get Convergance. I judge tweaks right from the post install respring and if they don't meet my expectations, they get removed. If I don't immediately see it making a difference, I don't like it.

That's just me though. You might get it and absolutely love it.

I apologize to the dev if this comment comes off as an attempt to lower his sales. Scaring potential customers is not my intention."

GhostsofDogma,TumblrInAction,1390633949.0,"Saying that skin color is caused by sun exposure alongside saying that race ""isn't biologically a thing"" implies that they think it's an acquired trait, i.e., someone getting a tan and producing a child with tanned skin. Now, correlation with latitude does mean that there is an evolutionary basis for race in which skin color appropriate for the region was selected for, but that would mean it *is* a biological thing. I think people are afraid to admit this because they think it will lead to someone saying black people are genetically predisposed to being less intelligent, which is a load of fuck that's easily disproven. It takes a SJW-y mindset to motivate someone to take such a huge leap in logic IMO.

STARS.

Situation. Task. Action. Result. Skill.

For every question you are asked, describe a past situation where you had to deal with it or something similar. The more recent the better. Then describe the task or responsibility you were handed. Now describe the action you took to resolve the problem. What was the result or resolution? What professional skill did you gain or hone?

Answer every question that way. 

As far as specific questions go that don't seem to have a good answer, the trick isn't to answer it honestly, but to answer it in such a way that highlights your strengths and hides your weaknesses. For example, the workplace conflict question. If you're like me, you don't bother with that drama so you seemingly can't speak to it right? Wrong. That answer makes you seem untested. Instead, I say that, there can be personality conflicts in any workplace, and that the best way I've found to avoid them is to stay ahead of them through open communication and encouraging and supporting a collaborative work environment. Now, instead of saying I have had any workplace conflicts with coworkers, I've highlighted my personal strengths and attractive characteristics to explain why and how I have avoided them.

Another tip. Bring a notebook with you. Open it up so that there are two pages open. On the page on the right, write down their questions as they're being asked. It makes you appear organized and prepared for anything, as well as buys you a few seconds to look down and get your thoughts straight....on the page on the left, in advance of the interview, make three sections: 
 
- write down the skills required for the job and the things you've done that show off those skills

- write down the things that you've done and relate them to some aspect of professional growth

- research the employer and come up with three questions for the end of the interview: one that shows you've looked at their business plan and would like to know how what you would be doing aligns within it; another question about what opportunities exist for professional development; and the last one on a typical week's work and demands in the job and for the team. 

This last part illustrates that you can think on an extremely high level and have an interest not just in a job but THIS job. Do not leave until you hammer that point across.

Make no mention of any nerves you have. It's also always a good idea to crack a tasteful joke during the interview, but never at the beginning or the end. Liven it up in the middle with something off the cuff. 

Do not be afraid to toot your own horn. No one else will do it for you. You need to be your own best advocate. If you find it difficult, sell yourself like you would someone else who wholly impressed you.

If you do all of that, I give it 3 or 4 interviews before you are hired."
Avistew,relationship_advice,1390635324.0,"My shortest relationship was 5 years old, but I'm not sure what you're getting at here. I don't see what the length of my relationships has to do with this issue.

There is pretty much no context in the opening post. You have decided, for some reason, to interpret it as ""I go out on a date with my boyfriend but then suddenly decide to text while he's talking to me, and ignore him. He asks what I'm texting and I refuse to answer so he looks over my shoulder. How rude is he?!"" but that's all conjecture.

I could come up with a scenario that's completely different. For instance, the OP is in the living room eating while her boyfriend is playing videogames. She's feeling lonely and bored so she starts texting her friends. Suddenly her boyfriend sneaks up behind her and reads over her shoulder. She doesn't notice right away. When she does, she asks him to stop, but he repeats that attitude on a regular basis"".

Both these scenarios are completely imaginary, though. The Opening Post gives no context. So what we know is he reads over her shoulder, it bothers her, and he still does it. If her problem really is that she's ignoring him, then he should mention it to her rather than expect her to read his mind. She has a problem and she has told him, he should do the same, and respect her wishes.

If he truly thinks reading her texts is ""not a big deal"" there is no reason why it would be such a loss for him not to do it. ""Not a big deal"" goes both ways."

I've read that, but I don't get it- If a man points a gun at me, and I stop him with a rubber bullet- I was in fear for my life and wounded him because I was in fear for my life. When unarmed people get lucky and beat up shooters- are they prosecuted for the injuries?

I'm not saying I'm gonna switch over completely, but I carry 2-3 pistols on me, why not have one of my backups be the designated rubber gun for the obscure situations where it could be useful? Im well aware of how complicated it all is, like how the rubber bullet could kill him anyhow, he could return fire if tough enough, he won't be dead so I'll have to restrain him if I'm successful etc. The main thing that bugs me is how normal bullets penetrate walls, even a 22 can go through tons of sheetrock and I'm looking for a way to prevent that.

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1390640164.0,"So much love for Meow Cosmetics. Sinks right into your skin and has an extensive shade range. The formula I like the best is the Purrfect one (light coverage) but you might consider the Pampered Puss one as it has zinc oxide which has anti-inflammatory benefits and might help with your acne. They technically make foundation so I'm not sure if you're set on liquid foundation but if you aren't I'd definitely give this a try and they have $1 samples available so you can take them for a spin before purchasing a full size. 

Otherwise, I'm not big on mascara/eyeliner, but I generally like using shadow wet as liner because I feel like I have a bit more control/wider color variety/I'm cheap and don't have to buy actual liner. 

For liquid foundation (although I'm not using one now I did before) I think it sometimes depends on the formula and what you're going for. For example - if I were using liquid foundation and going for a no makeup-makeup look I'd use just a couple of dots and blend it in with my fingers. I'd only give myself light coverage for that. If I wanted heavier coverage I'd stipple with a brush. If I wanted a dewy flawless finish with more coverage than with my fingers and less than with a brush I'd go for the beauty blender wet. "

1up-,AskMen,1390640269.0,"Back in high school, my brother (17ish at the time) and this girl at work used to flirt *constantly* they would spend the entire shift talking, teasing each other, making excuses to touch each other, etc. They would hang out after work and go to the movies. They would even text all the time. 

We, the family and their coworkers, just sorta assumed they were dating or something and left it alone. So I turned 14 and started working at the same shop and my brother and the girl started inviting me to the movies and to dinner with them, not just to be polite, but they genuinely wanted me there. After a couple times of feeling awkward about being the third wheel on their dates, I told my brother to go on dates alone, and he just looked at me flabbergasted. 

He didn't realize she was flirting with him for months. He just thought they were being friends, since he never had a girlfriend and spent his free time playing WoW, he didn't know. He didn't want to date her, and once he explained that he didn't know any better, they sorta stopped talking and she got a new job. 

Tl;Dr We thought my brother was dating a girl for months, turns out he's just oblivious. She got sad and quit."

Oneill95,everymanshouldknow,1390641158.0,"Some solid advice there. On my CPR course I was taught to use DR'S ABCs. You should obviously begin by both getting people's attention for assistance (if it's safe) and calling the emergency services. 

Danger - check for any potential dangers around you and respond accordingly. This can include staying where you are and simply keeping watch. If you get hurt yourself you can become more of a hinderance than a help.  

Reaction - when approaching the casualty talk to them, if there's no response lightly touch them to get noticed. 

Safety - After assessing the situation again for dangers you need to decide if it's appropriate for you to move to a safer location, with or without the casualty. 

Airways - If possible check the airways for anything that could restrict the flow of air. If possible and safe to do so try to get it out. 

Breathing/Bleeding - check to see that the casualty is breathing and if there is any major blood loss. Apply pressure if there is any bleeding. 

Chest Compressions - If they are not breathing begin chest compressions to the song 'Staying Alive' by the Bee Jees. Unless there is a suitable set of equipment nearby do not give mouth to mouth.  If the casualty is a child use your index and middle fingers only for chest compressions, regular compressions could cause damage. 

Your main role is to keep this person alive until paramedics arrive so do not attempt to treat injuries unless it involves preventing bleeding or clearing airways. "

daisyismydog,Indiemakeupandmore,1390642813.0,"Oh neat, that's awesome to know they really listen! 

I just got these today so I've only worn one of them for a day now so here are some first impressions: 

I have dehydrated skin and was a bit hesitant about these despite the website describing them as suitable for dry skin. I am seriously so impressed how well this, as a powder product, turned out for me. I wore them alone without any extra moisturizer (usually I use an oil or extra Cerave for powder products) save for maybe a bit from the cream highlighter in the Neopolitan palette. My skin felt fantastic and not tight-feeling at all the entire time and further, it didn't look powdery or dry or cracked when I washed my face. 

Otherwise, I do think they add something of a very subtle glow to skin which is best seen on skin that doesn't have any textural or pigmentation issues because I could see more of a difference on my forehead (quite smooth and even) than on my cheeks (acne/acne scars). I only checked this out with natural light though so I'm planning to see how it looks under artificial lighting soon.

irondal2,AskReddit,1390643745.0,"Man, I'll let ya know when I do. I've just figured out a series of things I DON'T wanna do with my life. Consider for example my one time plan to stay in the army 20 years. I wanted to be an army officer, and more specifically I wanted to graduate from west point and maybe later become an attorney in the jag corps. 

..during hs, I was in the jrotc and I was good at it, I got high grades and the sat/act scores I needed to get my foot in the door of a congressperson's office for an interview for their nomination, and once I got that, I busted my ass to get in shape for the physical fitness exam.

I submitted all my application paperwork/essays/picture/background info/etc. and I went for a medical exam on a local air force base as part of the application process. The findings of the medical exam review board revealed to the military academy that I had vascular surgery when I was 15 and I wear contact lenses. The admissions board at west point sent me a conditional letter of acceptance, which meant I could toe the line in NY on reception day if, and only if, I could get west point's medical personnel to grant me a waiver for the perceived issues potentiated by the surgery I had. 

The waiver didn't come prior to r-day. That didn't discourage irondal2.

So, being the persistent type of person I am, I researched the internets for another way in. The best thing I could come up with was to talk to a local army recruiter (after I had spoken to a general officer in the army medical corps, thanks to a few strings I pulled through some networking I had done). We all thought I could join the army as a private first class in the intelligence corps, and finish basic training, and I would thereby be able to offer the medical folks proof that I could handle all the rigors of the physical/mental/emotional training, and I did.

..fast forward to my sit down with the CO of the reception company of my unit after basic training, who is a west pointer. It was immediately apparent that guy is a fucking asshole. I wanted his endorsement (congressional nomination can be substituted by an applicant's CO's endorsement if the applicant is serving active duty). The CO wanted to see me off to NY. I saw how he treated his soldiers like rubbish. I didn't want to become the kind of robot he is who mimics whom or whatever that guy derived his leadership style from.

Also, my next-door neighbor in the barracks of that unit I was in had left west point when he had to decide if should stay or go as a yearling. I got to talking to my neighbor, who pretty much told me that I'd be in for four more years of the same exact situation we were experiencing. Battle (my neighbor) told me I'd have to put up with a bunch of pompous fucks like our then CO, and there would be hardly enough time for me to study, especially in the first couple years.

Meanwhile, I was applying again, and I did get the waiver, and my CO scheduled my physical fitness exam with another company commander (he couldn't administer it because it would've been a conflict of interest, but the other CO was a west point graduate as well, and both of those COs were eyeballing me hardcore for a solid month). I didn't show up to do my physical fitness exam. The COs' response ranks up there with the most epic guilt trips people have ever sent me on. I went from being the shit to being shit in the matter of fifteen minutes. The next (and the last) month I was in that company, my company commander smoked the shit outta me. All the while, I actually loved doing the exercise, though my commander wouldn't even let me speak to him to explain why I'd stood his friend up. Either way, my CO wanted to haze me, and he did.

tl;dr: Fuck you, read it. I had fun living it

BlueCarrotAntenna,IWantOut,1390645342.0,"Here's some quick facts:

* Sweden struggles with high unemployment. The most affected groups by this are young people (~20% unemployment) and foreigners ([~50% unemployment](http://www.thelocal.se/20131125/swedens-jobless-foreigners-level-worst-in-eu)). Will the situation be different in 5 years? Probably. But not necessarily in the positive direction.

* Scandinavian employers are notorious for preferring to hire other Scandinavians due to common culture and intelligible languages. 

* Business degrees are sadly not in demand because they're not exactly hard to get. And frankly, Bachelors is kind of low. Universities are free for citizens in Scandinavia and majority of Europe, so you'll be competing with a lot of people who have a Masters just because they can.

* Not speaking fluent Swedish in your field is a massive handicap. Scandinavians *can* speak English, but that doesn't mean they want to.

The one thing you have going for you is that Sweden has a pretty sweet visa setup, so if someone offers you a job that meets certain pay criteria, you will be able to get a visa (this isn't so easy in Norway for example where you also have to prove you have sufficient education, which might be tricky with just a bachelors). Finding such job will be hard due to all the points listed above, but you never know I suppose. 

Good luck!"

avatar_aang_,dogemining,1390647216.0,"- The pool hash rate is 926 MH/S.  The network hashrate is 84.8 GH/S.  Since one block is found every minute, the expected time for Rapidhash to find a block is 91 minutes.
- Unfortunately, the ""block progress"" indicator is at 322%.  ""Block Progress"" is a misnomer, since you don't really make ""progress"" on a block - it's just the expected time to find a block.
- So, that means it's been 91 minutes * 3.22 = almost five hours since the pool has found a block.  Since the pool only pays out when it finds something, you haven't been paid anything yet.

So basically it's a combination of bad luck and the pool being small to begin with.  With a small pool, you'll get larger &amp; less consistent payouts; with a larger pool you'll get smaller payouts but they will happen frequently.  However, in the *long run* the payout will be more or less the same regardless of pool size."

Also, MP4, AVI, etc. are only [container formats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_container_format) that can contain differently encoded audio/video data. This means that the Xbox can read, for example, one MP4 because it knows those codecs, but not other MP4s because that data uses different codecs the Xbox doesn't know.

When the instances of the Doctor were circling Gallifrey, and calling out their incarnations, near the end of the sequence, after ""Twelve!"", there was clearly another Doctor's Tardis, with Capaldi bushy eyebrows exclaiming ""Thirteen!""

Androgar said it, not Twelfth.

&gt;Since 12 (well, *technically* with the Moffat ret-conning, 13) was there, and the current Doctor, and *not* yet going through a regeneration, why doesn't he remember a 13th (or, technically 14th) Doctor arriving to help move Gallifrey into another universe?

Get Bit and Tsuro, for example, are games I would never have encountered otherwise, and they're just so much fun even with a young child in the mix.

Get in between him and things that he likes and demand some sort of request from him before he gets it. Start off small, eye contact, a purposeful noise and build from there if you find it working. Don't do it to the point of frustrating him or making him angry but don't make his life too easy either :) You'll know yourself where the edge of his comfort zone is.

Basically, my advice is to start small and build on it. Use any little thing that he enjoys to open circles of non verbal communication (turn taking, eye contact, play, rough and tumble) and put yourself in the middle of activities he enjoys so that he can't ignore you.

rohrspatz,askscience,1390654329.0,"This isn't quite true.

Your stomach doesn't hold onto *all* of its contents until all of the food inside is digested. As I've commented elsewhere, the pyloric sphincter is capable of regulating what passes through it, much like a sieve - it starts opening and closing periodically once it detects that there's something in the stomach, but it doesn't actually let anything leave until it's small enough. If you drink a bunch of fluid, it will exit the stomach pretty much as soon and as quickly as the pyloric sphincter lets it.

However - the pyloric sphincter will also only open if the duodenum tells it that it's ready for more. The small intestine needs things to be pretty much a consistent paste, so if the duodenum gets a big gush of basically just water/fluid, it'll be ready in no time, because it doesn't have to do a lot of work to prep things for the next phase of digestion. But if it gets a bunch of little pea-sized bits of food, it won't be ready for a while.

*This* is why eating helps with alcohol consumption. If you eat solid foods, your pyloric sphincter opens less frequently due to the time the food takes to digest, so the alcohol-containing fluid/paste/goo in your stomach is released over a longer period of time. Drinking water actually helps even more by diluting the alcohol a bit. (Each time the pyloric sphincter opens, it will only let a certain volume of stuff through to avoid overfilling the duodenum, so if you've drunk a bunch of water, there's even less alcohol in each ""hit"".)"

Have you ever had menstrual cramps? Those are teeny tiny contractions. Now, if you already get horrible menstrual cramps dont freak out. Labor isnt necessarily *worse* (than the *very* worst periods) just bigger, as your uterus is now the size of your entire stomach. 

Also, keep in mind that during many hours of labor, if you are having a normal labor and not stuck in tr a nsition (which woukd suuuuck) you will have a distinct contraction and then a break with no contraction at all where you can rest, relax and prepare for the next one. It helps.

During transition the break goes away. Transition is tough, but it also should be very short compared to the rest of labor and signals that it is almost time to push. Transition happens as your body opens the final last bit of dilation."

Fairy_floss84,AskReddit,1390656894.0,"Never looking after me when I was sick. Had glandular fever and  tonsillitis one day, dragged myself to work and just collapsed every time i got home. Doctor said ""oh shit"" when he checked my throat and said it was very bad.

Luckily it was Christmas so I had a few days off work, because my ex didn't ""let"" me stay home, as I was a temp and didn't get sick leave. 

I felt like vomiting and he made me come to the shops with him, he said if I didn't he might just meet another girl at the shops. So I sat in the car feeling like hell. When we got home, he spent all day playing video games while I slept and felt depressed. He even said I should go to my parents and they could look after me. He hated it when I got sick, and I always looked after him when he was unwell.


After we broke up, he moved states and wrote me a long soppy email, asking me to take him back. He even paid for my plane ticket and hotel, and I was stupid and flew over there. He was so sweet at first, we had sex and then I realised that I must have had gastro, because the next day I spent all day vomiting, and generally feeling like I was going to die.

He dragged me around town, saying that was upset that I wasn't showing much interest in the town, while I was trying not to vomit. I was scared because  I never felt so sick, and the flight was almost four hours home.

He walked me to the doctor, walking way ahead of me and when he was hungry he ordered fish and chips and the smell made me barf, I was kneeling over the dockside and throwing up, while he stood far away and eating.

At the doctors he looked pissed, and wasn't happy. I was sick all over the bathroom floor at the doctors and cried but he didn't even look at me.

This is the man who begged me back and said he would spend the rest of his life trying to make me happy.

I got a bit better, but he said if I didn't drink water and felt sick the next day, he would leave me in the hotel room.

He left me in the room to go and have dinner with his flatmate, who I later found out he dated. He got very angry when I suspected it.

He never talked about us getting together again, and spent the time criticising my clothes, the way I ate. He got angry when I didn't eat all my dinner, and made me cry again. 


When I got back home, he started to ignore me and I asked what's going on. He said distance won't work and we should forget it. I tried calling and he said his flatmates family is over and he can't talk, I kept calling and calling and he hung up and turned his phone off.

I was so angry and angry at myself. But this was something that helped me get over  him for good, because I finally saw what a horrible person he is,

I will never forgive him or understand how a person can do this ? He knew how bad the breakup was for me, yet he did it.

&gt; Until 2004, massive loudspeakers mounted on several of the buildings delivered DPRK propaganda broadcasts directed towards the south.[11] Originally the content extolled the North's virtues in great detail and urged disgruntled soldiers and farmers to simply walk across the border to be received as brothers.[17] Eventually, as its value in inducing defections proved minimal,[18] the content was switched to condemnatory anti-Western speeches, agitprop operas, and patriotic marching music for up to 20 hours a day.[17] In 2004, both North and South agreed to mutually end their loudspeaker broadcasts at each other.[19]

""If we let the gays marry, what's to stop people from marrying their cats? They took our jerbs! And thanks, Obama!"" Any other conservative talking points you care to bring up? 

Disregarding the fact that a slippery slope argument is inherently fallible, I will simply point out the most obvious and common argument against your childish opinion since I'm pressed for time. 

The most applicable comparison to gay marriage is interracial marriage. A person's race (or gender) does not constitute a legal basis to deny or withhold a person's rights. We've already been over this with the whole segregation thing. No matter what race or gender you are, you can drink out of the same water fountain as everyone else because you know, you're a human being. Do you want to bring back white-only water fountains? Oh, wait, do you think that's another false equivalency? Sorry, it's not. It's the same exact thing. By the way, ""Colored's only"" was the historical term used for that. What would be a more appropriate terminology for that along the same lines as marriage isn't an appropriate term for a gay union? The civil rights debate is over, man. Denying the right to marry to a group of people is the same fucking thing as telling a black person they're not good enough to drink out of the same water fountain as you. You're not racist, are you? Yea, I went there. If you're not making a religious argument, which I believe you're not, there are numerous legal cases you can look up in regards to this matter. Start with *Perez v Sharp* and then work your way up to the DOMA ruling and *In RE Marriage cases* via the California Supreme Court. 

Furthermore, and on a non-emotional note, it is detrimental to the fiscal interests of the state to deny the marriages of same-sex couples. 

You may be ""only"" hung up on terminology, but it's that exact type of thing that throws a wrench in the gears. 

Excuse me, I need to go find a ""whites-only"" water fountain to quench my thirst after that rant.

Vad kul att du frågade! För det första så presenterar inte Affe bara fakta, han säger själv att mycket är spekulation."" [Så borde det gå att få fram en hyfsad uppskattning av läget idag](http://affes.wordpress.com/invandrarna-och-brotten-utrakning/) "" går att läsa i slutet av första stycket. [Även här](http://affes.wordpress.com/about/) upplyser han direkt om att man lätt kan förvilla m.h.a. statistik samt att han inte är någon statistiker. Ville bara nämna det då jag tycker det påverkar hans trovärdighet i ämnet. 

En första [liten](http://affes.wordpress.com/invandrarna-och-brotten-utrakning/) miss här är att han räknat fel på procenten brott som begåtts i sitt resultat. Av 1 416 280 anmälda brott ska invandrare stå för 54,4%. 1 416 280 * 0,544 blir inte 770 849, det blir 770 456 stycken vilket såklart gör att svenskarnas andel inte heller stämmer, den blir då 645 824. Mina resultat är avrundade för enkelhetens skull, de visar ändå att han använder ett stapeldiagram baserat på ett antal som inte stämmer. Ingen stor sak med knappt 1000 brott av totalt 1 416 280, men ändå en manipulerad siffra. Sen kommer nästa rad av vackra stapeldiagram. Väldigt fina, men vad säger det oss? Enligt Affe visar det här på 'alternativa uträkningar' både vildare och mer försiktiga. Med dina ord tror jag det heter ""dra det ur röven"". Det förklaras i en liten mening innan; ""Jag har ingen möjlighet att göra några skattningar eftersom att jag inte har de data som krävs"".. Men han gjorde de alltså ändå, för skojs skull? Här presenteras alltså HANS teorier som fakta för den som skummar igenom texten och inte tar fram den trogna miniräknaren. Intressant också är att summan inte matchar den totala mängden brott som begåtts men procenten stämmer varje gång. 

[På den här sidan](http://affes.wordpress.com/invandrarna-och-brotten-2-utrakning/) visar han oss Brås statistik på grova rån och andelen som är utförda av invandrare. Har väldigt svårt att följa hans tankespår i slutet under rubriken ""De icke folkbokförda"". Redan i början nämner han att de står för 4% av **alla rån** och 3% av **alla brott**. Intressant jämförelse, men innan vi fortsätter måste vi påpeka att alla rån redan ingår i alla brott. Låter uppenbart men det har tydligen undkommit Affe här. Affe fortsätter sen att påstå att det är 33,33% skillnad. Matematiken där stämmer, hade det skett exakt lika många rån som **övriga** brott så hade de icke folkbokförda invandrarna begått 33,33% fler rån än övriga brott. Men eftersom rånen tillhör den redan stora kategorin ""alla brott"" så kan inte det stämma. Siffran 4% är alltså en del av det som är 3% av det hela, alltså 4% av 3%. 3 x 0,04=0,12. Av alla brott är alltså 0,12% grova rån utförda av icke folkbokförda invandrare/turister. En liten siffra, också betydligt mindre än 33,33% **vilken också redan ingår i siffran han försöker addera den till**. Han nyttjar alltså här sin magiska röv för att framkalla missvisande fakta. Dessutom skiljer han inte på % och procentenhet, utan tutar på och kallar allting procent för enkelhetens skull.

Nothing justifies his treatment of women and if he raped Desiree Washington I hope one day he will admit it, because the redemption he seems to seek can never be attained until he does, but I don't see how it helps anybody to look away from the worst things humanity is capable of. You don't have to feel sorry for him to want to understand how a person can end up that way.

&gt;Donald McRae, on the other hand, is an absolute disgrace for glossing over the rape conviction with his offhand remark about ""distressing problems with women"". It's obvious what happened here - he met Tyson, found him fascinating, complex and likeable, all of which he seems in this interview - and decided to give him a free pass on that one. It's dishonest journalism and an insult to victims of sexual violence. It tells them that a rapist simply serving jail time is sufficient penance. It isn't and never can be.

Hen är bara inte ett ord jag identifierar mig med just för att det inte könar mig. Vet någon inte mitt kön så ser inte jag det som ett bättre alternativ till en felaktig gissning. Förstår du hur jag menar? Jag menar absolut inte att du ska sluta använda det, eller att försöka förminska folk som identifierar sig med det. Det är bara det att jag föredrar andra alternativ, till och med ""den"" när någon refererar till mig. T.ex. om någon ser mig på andra sidan rummet och säger vi går och pratar med henne istället för honom så skulle jag inte ta mindre illa upp av hen. För mig är hen ett ord som används istället för ""den"" när man inte vet könet på den man pratar om, och jag tycker att det är tråkigt att vissa känner att könet är det enda som identifierar dem. Det finns nästan alltid andra alternativ, man har t.ex. kanske ett yrke, en utbildning, vänner eller familjemedlemmar som man kan bli kallad efter. T.ex. Xxxs syskon, eller Yyys barn, Cccs vän eller tandläkaren osv. Det är vad jag personligen tycker, sen förstår jag att det är viktigt att visa hänsyn till de som inte tycker likadant. Men det räcker inte med bara det tyvärr, vi kan inte börja kalla alla hen för det är alltid någon som inte är nöjd. Det viktigaste är att visa personerna att det finns mer att identifiera sig med, och att det faktiskt inte spelar någon roll om någon inte säger rätt. Bara för att jag kallar en kille för hon betyder inte det att killen egentligen borde vara en tjej, eller att jag vill att han ska vara det. Det beror troligtvis på ett ärligt misstag. Det hen försöker visa är att man accepterar alla människor, men det kommer ändå bli fel ibland. Om de verkligen mår så dåligt att de inte vill leva längre p.g.a. vad andra tycker så är det en tragedi och de behöver hjälp med sitt psykiska välmående. Det är självklart tufft att söka sig till någon att prata med men det är en viktig livskunskap att lära sig kunna strunta i vad andra tycker. Det kommer alltid finnas idioter, man måste lära sig leva med dem. "

You're doing all you can for her as a friend, and it's good to hear she'll be seeing the university therapist soon. As you mentioned, she needs professional help with both this and her other issues - you can't provide, or be expected to provide, that sort of support.

I think it's important for you to not feel like you need to be everything and everyone to your friend. All that will do is burn you out fast and remove that support from her anyway.

You don't mention any other friends in your post. Do you and she have any other mutual friends who you can use to grow your friend's support structure? If so, try to bring them in to help you, both to give your friend more people to talk to (and perhaps lessen your own load), and so you can have time to work on your own life. Sounds like you're pretty stressed yourself (apart from the stress your friend is giving you).

The first channel that opened up was a documentary on the BBC over exotic pet ownership in the USA. Pretty interesting, so we kept watching it. After a while, they start talking about GW'S Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma - whoa! I know where that is!

It turns out they have a bus where they travel around to towns and let people take pictures with baby animals. I've done it before and played with a baby bear. As they are doing the interview, I realize they are in my hometown. The BBC guy is interviewing them. Now here is where it started to get weird: They began to interview a kid I had graduated with.

Here's the quote: ""How on earth you could validly get a conviction of a husband-wife rape when they’re living together, sleeping in the same bed, she’s in a nightie, and so forth, there’s no injury, there’s no separation or anything.” He's talking about the lack of evidence in such cases, and how hard it would be to convict. You seriously quote The Daily Beast?

http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/01/republican-plan-redefine-rape-abortion

This was a bipartisan bill that had bad wording (forceable) in one of the multiple versions before the final that went to vote. Motherjones (wow you have some awesome sources) frames it as the GOP trying to legalize rape. Not surprised. OMG you guys, war on women!

http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/state-legislator-criticized-for-comments-on-rape-hj76f4k-173587961.html

Here's the quote: ""He also told me one thing, 'If you do (have premarital sex), just remember, consensual sex can turn into rape in an awful hurry,' "" Rivard said. ""Because all of a sudden a young lady gets pregnant and the parents are madder than a wet hen and she's not going to say, 'Oh, yeah, I was part of the program.' All that she has to say or the parents have to say is it was rape because she's underage. And he just said, 'Remember, Roger, if you go down that road, some girls,' he said, 'they rape so easy""
There are plenty of prosecutable cases of false rape claims every year. It happens. So why is it that talking about your father warning against such claims is ""rape apology""? That's pure bullshit. Good source for once though!

And that's just for movies and TV shows - video game locatilzations are on their own seperate level of terrible.

For example, the old PlayStation game *Legend of Dragoon* is localized so badly, you really do get the impression that they used only two voice actors; one for all male characters, one for all female characters.

The baby boomers and gen x had fairly strict boundaries (1945-60 and 1965-80 respectively) but the generation past that has been called all sorts of things.  When I was a teen it was 'Gen Y' or ""the beavis and butthead generation"" was even thrown around, lol.  Then the term ""Millennial"" came along but was ill-defined.  It was supposed to be the kids who were in or graduating high school around the turn of the millennium, but that's confusing since prior we did tend to define generations in 15 year stretches.  People seem to treat ""Gen Y"" and Millennial"" as the same thing.  I roughly apply it to kids born between 1985 and 2000, and don't make a distinction between the two, myself.  I'm a ""tweenie"" - 1980, too young to be a Gen Xer, way too old to be a Millennial.  Barak Obama is a tweenie too, he's not a Baby Boomer, but certainly not a Gen Xer either.

If you want it bad enough, you make these things happen. Also, a gym is not the only place a person can exercise and becomes more fit. One can get equipment for their home, those door bar things are ~$20 and are good for chin ups and pull ups. Used equipment can be purchased in a variety of places. A beginner could use body weight squats, lunges, etc.

i_am_a_freethinker,mormon,1390664289.0,"I'm probably as surprised as you are, but I tend to agree with you. With some pretty large caveats:

This works *if and only if* you want to understand the believer's perspective. That's the only real ""benefit"" I see. However, it won't help you come to God, it won't help you believe in God, and it won't help you glean any sort of special knowledge from the scriptures.

You also should read it from a very skeptical perspective, where you assume the following:

* While God may or may not exist, assume that deity had no hand in these words

* Assume God is unknowable, and may in fact be malevolent

* Assume the stories you're reading *are ancient man's best guess at what really happens in the natural world*.

With these three, I think, a lot of the New and Old Testament make more sense. Why would there be notably false stories in Genesis, including but not limited to Creation, Noah's Flood, and the Tower of Babel? Because the people who created these mythologies wondered how we got here, marvelled at a large flood, and noticed that we speak different languages. It's just an effort to *understand* the world, in their limited capabilities.

Why does Paul never say that Christ is God? Because Paul was writing before the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) were written, and that particular mythology had not been developed yet. Why do Luke and Matthew share many stories with Mark, but not vice versa? Because Matthew and Luke had Mark as a source-text, along with another text (called Q).

This skeptical view of the scriptures explain why the Gospels tell different stories, tell the same stories with different details, and flat-out contradict each other. 

With this skeptical view, I think you can come to a very real appreciation for the completely **human** nature of the scriptures. They are not inspired, they are completely man-made. Any sense of purpose we give them is our own.

Even if we go to a half-way sort of path, a lot of your assumptions just don't make sense. Why would perfect, loving God slaughter millions of innocent people? Why would God display very base human emotions? Why would prophesies written after the fact be spot-on, but prophesies about the future be fuzzy and come with huge caveats?

Why do none of the modern scriptures prophesy things that are completely commonplace after 1900, like telephones, or cars, or jet engines, or the **internet**? But somehow the BoM gets Christopher Columbus and Jo Smith's dad also being named Joseph? It's pretty fucking sketchy.

To me, if God does exist, it makes more sense to assume that he is either malevolent, or doesn't give a shit about humans. Why are there filarial eye worms? AIDS? Malaria? Cancer? Rape? Starvation? Torture? What about hurricanes or tsunamis or droughts or wildfire? If God is a huge dick, or completely incompetent, a whole lot of stuff starts to fall in line."

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1390665413.0,"Don't care for the boundaries/rules semantics games that is popular in poly media these days in which ""rules"" are defined, rather arbitrarily, as rigid things that can't be broken and if they are, the breakee will be ""punished"" and ""boundaries"" are defined as what people USED to call rules, things you don't want your partner doing with other people.

Boundaries should be used to describe a PERSONAL boundary.  You can't make a boundary for someone else.  For example, I could say, ""It's important to me that my stuff remains mine and isn't shared with a prospective metamour.  That's my boundary.""  And that's fine, but it doesn't give my partner any hard and fast ideas about what I mean specifically.  If I leave it at a nebulous boundary, he might know, OK, obviously, metamour can't borrow my clothes.  But am I going to lose my shit if she uses my toothbrush by accident?  Does sharing ""my stuff"" go as far as say, putting her on the family cell phone plan?  

Rules, traditionally, are things used to ENFORCE personal boundaries.  So instead of just saying ""I don't want to share my things"" I state ""I would prefer if she didn't borrow my clothes or sleep in my bed, but having sex in the bed is OK, I just don't want her sleeping there.""  

Just because that's called a rule doesn't imply punishment if it's broken, it just means that the metamour is coming into conflict with my boundaries, and I have to decide if I can tolerate that or not.

I hate the idea that just having rules means that they're going to be broken.  Nobody says, ""Don't have rules about sexual health and protection!  That just means they'll be broken.""  Yes, overly restrictive rules can create a situation where it's easy to break them and ""be in trouble"" all the time, but it's up to the partner who feels controlled to stand up for themselves.  Just because someone wants to make a rule doesn't mean the other person has to agree.  Rules are mutually-agreed upon, whereas boundaries just ""are"" and have no logic necessarily.

When partners have clear cut knowledge of what, specifically, is going to upset their partner, they can avoid it.  Vague boundaries seem engendered to create more trouble.  If a partner says, ""My boundary is that I need to feel special,"" that doesn't really say anything about what the other can do to ensure that.  Then you're left with a screaming fight when the more insecure partner is furious because you scheduled a date with your OSO on a holiday and you're violating her boundary of making her feel special!  You had no clue that was important and now you're in a bind.  Whereas if she'd said ""I have boundaries around needing to feel special.  Will you agree to ask me before you schedule a date with your OSO on holidays?"" then you have basically created a ""rule"" even if you choose not to call it one, the rule being you're going to ask.  You might slip up and forget to ask, and then you can apologize and make amends, or if you find that rule too restrictive you can renegotiate.

Not meant to be a rant at you specifically, I just have a lot of feelings about the ""no rules"" stuff that seems so popular now."

killroy1971,sex,1390665467.0,"You screwed up the communications.  Now your g/f is in crazy mode.  She's holding onto her anger as she's invested a lot emotionally.  She's mad at you for not telling her -- she probably gets blow-by-blow updates from her g/fs about their lives, something men just don't do.  She probably also worried that if you become too successful you won't find her as desirable.  Part of her wants her fears validated with a break up.  Part of her wants to open up and trust again, but it's difficult for women to change course once they've decided on their emotional state.  Before anyone thinks I'm being sexist, consider the number of women in abusive relationships who know they can and should leave but can't get past their now invalidated emotions to actually leave.  It happens to men, but our culture doesn't turn it into a twisted badge of honor.
Trust will take a long time to regain.  She has literally an ocean of anger and anxiety to cross before she can trust you.  It may never happen.  Her g/fs may take her out and look the other way while she cheats.  It gives them something to dish about when they do something stupid themselves.  You may have to take this one on the chin and move on.  Next time, listen to the passive ""hints"" women drop that mask their true feelings.  i.e. ""You always want sex in the morning"" really meant ""I want sex and you're not giving it to me.""
Yes, relationships are 90% about the woman, the rest being whatever scraps you can get.  Your g/f could have offered to do the dishes.  She could have let you nap.  She could have asked you why you were spending so much time away.  Instead she choose to drop hints, hoping you'd do all of the work while she reaped the rewards.  Unfortunately that's how relationships work in our country.  Keep this in mind in your future relationships, because unless you're willing to drop everything and bust your butt to win her back this relationship is all but done.  Just know that she could also see you as a looser for not also busting your but and being gainfully employed once college ends drop you then."

I think you are accidentally correct here. The quote was from his father warning him about the existence of false rape claims.

In the US, it started with forced sterilizations on the mentally disabled then it extended to other ""undesireables"": the physically disabled, racial minorities and poor people.  Because that was who the state decided were not worthy of the ""privilege"" of reproduction.

You can use therapy to help you learn how to set boundaries better. And you can use the therapist as a sounding board since you don't have a lot of friends to vent to in conjunction with your diary.

That said, your mother seriously needs therapy herself. In addition I would recommend suggesting a couple of family sessions to discuss this. The therapist will highly likely be quick to tell her (though not in such harsh, obvious language) that her violating your privacy isn't okay and that what you wrote about is normal and fine.

THEN I'd charter a boat for the new world and try to get my hands on potatoes. I'd breed a strain that would be an excellent rotator and sell the potatoes as animal feed stock, until it really catches on. Rainy rocky soil isn't really good for to much besides spuds. At this point I'd fund expeditions to little known parts of the world and set up shop reaping gold, silver, fur, and spices. I'd give explicit instructions that every ship have someone to make daily ships logs for posterity. Also provide them with simple kits on trade with the natives where ever they went. Things like iron tools, bolts of cotton, and samples of raw trade goods. I'd try and make the most of it before small pox and influenza kill off everybody.

I should be the wealthiest person alive in about 20 years so I'd have my print shop focus on jump starting the enlightenment. I'd also diversify WHERE my money and investments are kept so that much like the rothschilds no one government can subvert my children's efforts."

Pybro5ever,killingfloor,1390668418.0,"Think of it like this: the Commando is already vastly different than the other perks because of their abilities to see cloaked enemies (Stalkers/Patriarch) and health bars, giving them ample tactical advantages, such as when to keep kiting a Flesh Pound or go all in and attack it. Their weapons are straightforward because their purpose is to attack, and that is what assault rifles are made for.

Let's do a quick analysis of the weapons. I will be analyzing these as a level 6 Commando on the Suicidal difficulty.

**Bullpup** - Clip of 50, good scope. Clots take 6 shots to the body from full health to die, or 1 shot in the head (destroys the head) and 1 in the body.

**Tommy Gun** - Clip of 37, iron sights. Clots take 4 bodyshots / 1 headshot.

**Dr. T's Lead Delivery System** - Clip of 50, iron sights. Clots take 4 bodyshots / 1 headshot.

**Rising Storm Tommy Gun** - Clip of 62, iron sights. Clots take 4 bodyshots / 1 headshot.

**M4** - Clip of 37, decent scope. Clots take 4 bodyshots / 1 headshot.

**AK47** - Clip of 37, good iron sights. Clots take 3 bodyshots / 1 headshot.

**MKb42** - Clip of 37, good iron sights. Clots take 3 bodyshots / 1 headshot.

**SCARMK17** - Clip of 25, decent scope. Clots take 3 bodyshots / 1 headshot. Enough damage to stun a clot with 1 bodyshot.

**FNFAL ACOG** - Clip of 25, tricky but good scope (aim for intersection of top and middle red lines). Clots take 3 bodyshots / 1 headshot. Enough damage to stun a clot with 1 bodyshot.

Now, this doesn't give you much insight into how to actually use these, especially since Clots are only two steps up from having the lowest health (lowest being Crawler, followed by Stalker), but it should give you an idea of the different tiers. My favorite loadout is an FNFAL with a Rising Storm as my backup weapon. The Rising Storm has such a huge clip that, should you find your main weapon needing a reload and you're swarmed, you will almost always be able to clear out enough space for you to reload your weapons.

I can do a deeper analysis on each weapon if you'd like, but these are sufficient for getting started with Commando.

tl;dr

Bullpup/Tommy Gun/Dr. T's/Rising Storm = Lots of ammo, weak
M4/AK47/MKb42 = Moderate power, moderate clipsize
Scar/FNFAL = Eats specimens' health bars for a snack, tiny (comparatively) clips"
Willravel,startrek,1390668422.0,"Exactly. Worse, it relies on understanding a history that, frankly, most of the audience doesn't know anything about. You and I have seen TOS and *Wrath of Khan* and the Augment arc of Enterprise and are aware of the references made to the Eugenics wars in the different series, but there's no way the general audience of the film are that level of Star Trek fan. The average audience member knows nothing about what Khan is, what he represents, why his compatriots mean so much to him, why they're such a danger, and why the reveal that this is Khan is so serious. The movie does absolutely no work actually establishing Khan, which is why it's so easy for the writers to change the character from scene to scene. In one moment he's a calculating genius, the next moment he's a terribly violent monster, the next moment he's a sympathetic leader to his people... without an actual character at his core, Khan is whatever the scene requires in a stock villain. 

One of the more frustrating aspects of the movie is the criminal misuse of Cumberbatch, who's a very capable actor who would do really well if given the opportunity. It's pretty clear, though, he was hired because he's popular now as Sherlock and his voice seems a bit deeper than his appearance. It'd be like hiring Leonard Nimoy to be a villain in a Transformers movie. Oh, wait...

Josh Leivo is looking pretty good. He has nice upside, could be a good versatile winger for us one day.

Jamie Devane is the team heavyweight, he's also a pretty good player though. In a couple years I can see him as our fighter who can also play. Stands straight up when he fights and needs to work on his balance, but throws bombs.

TJ Brennan is the team's star, so to speak, he's an offensive defenseman who scores at around a point per game pace, and was named to the AHL all-star team. Got a big shot, can put the team on his back i.e. he had a four point game and scored in overtime last week. 

Spencer Abbott is the top scoring player on the team, he's undersized but works really hard and has great offensive instincts. Very good on the powerplay.

Sam Carrick is the sparkplug of the team. Scores at point every other game pace, gets into fights, hits, generally creates energy. I'm excited for his future.

Other players to keep an eye on are Greg McKegg (versatile two-way centreman), Stuart Percy, (puck moving defensive defenseman) Tyler Biggs, (former first round pick has very little offensive upside, looks to be a good fourth liner) Andrew MacWilliam, (big hitting shutdown defenseman) and Petter Granberg (another shutdown defenseman)."

If you're trying to get something to not squeak, like a door or something, the proper thing to do is to clean it with WD40 and then use a lubricating oil such as 3-in-1. 

Just using WD40 will create a bigger issue for anything with a bearing or pin because you will remove all lubrication. Worse, since most plastics and rubbers are made from petroleum-based products, WD40 (and also PB Blaster and other petroleum-based products, solvent, penetrating or not) will cause them to break down.

Giant__midget,AskReddit,1390670518.0,"You cant be fucking serious! His father was warning him about false claims... and you call it a rape case! This isn't a matter of anyone's definition of rape! It's purely hypothetical, and it has already been defined! Neither you nor I or anyone else get to define this hypothetical case, because his father already said it would be consensual sex with a false rape claim sprung up later! Am I really explaining this to you? You have to be pulling my chain right now! Jesus Christ!

&gt;while discounting rape you don't think of as ""forceable rape""

When did I ever say any such stupid shit as that? You can't just put words in people's mouths so you can try to feel good about calling them your mean little feminist names. I know as well as anyone that not all rapes are forcible, even aside from statutory or date rapes. Did you think you could lie about what I said and I would believe it?

&gt;but you, and these men, want it to seem to be the case that the REAL problem isn't rape, it's men being accused of it.

Neither I nor the article or a single one of the men quoted ever said single fucking word about the frequency of rape claims, or what the ""real problem"" is. You're trying to put words in my mouth again and that's a really bad tactic on your part. It's making you look dumber and dumber. False rape claims are problem. As big a problem as rape? No, and no one ever said that, but that doesn't mean it should be ignored. Your logic sucks and you suck."

eighthgear,Warthunder,1390670544.0,"To be fair, A-10s can easily be downed by missiles as well. We know this, because a few A-10s were downed by missiles during the Gulf Wars, mainly [SA-9s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K31_Strela-1) and [SA-13s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K35_Strela-10).

The A-10 is incredibly tough, as is the SU-25, but that doesn't mean they are invincible. A MANPADS hit at the very least will take the plan out of action, even if it returns to base, and has a high likelihood of downing the plane outright. Larger missiles, like the ones used by those Iraqi Strelas, can definitely down an A-10. Yes, I'd rather get hit by a missile in an A-10 or an SU-25 than in a F-35 or something, but remember, the F-35 will be equipped with vastly more sophisticated electronic countermeasures to prevent it from being hit by missiles.

 An F-35's survivability over a modern battlefield would be vastly superior to an A-10. I mean, the Iraqis, who were hardly a peer foe to the US or anything close to having technological parity, managed to down some A-10s. A rival power with access to more sophisticated missiles would be a nightmare for an A-10 pilot.

Of course, the F-35 is far from entering service, and when it does, it won't have the ground strike capabilities of the A-10. But it will certainly be the safer aircraft against any sophisticated enemy.

I think it's a fair bet that companies don't hire people they don't need to do work, and we can also expect that they charge as much for their product as the market will tolerate.

When the minimum wage increases, won't that just cut into McDonald's profit margin?  Wouldn't that mean that instead of a corporation accumulating that wealth, that money would go to their workers so their workers could support themselves with full time work?

I guess I'm missing the down side to that.  

It's hard for me to feel it's wrong to have McDonald's give some of it's $5.5 billion net (!) profit to the people who do the physical work that plays a pretty substantial role in creating that wealth.

nottheprimeminister,IAmA,1390671342.0,"&gt; but when it comes to woman on male I just say you can't really rape a willing participant.

This is literally what this AMA is about. If you look just below this:

&gt;Orgasm and sexual arousal is primarily a physical reaction. Not to get too technical off the bat, but our sexual response is guided more by our autonomic nervous system. If you remember our highschool science, this is also known as the ""fight or flight"" system. In dangerous or highly charged emotional situations, this is part of our bodies defense system. Sexual arousal is very much keyed in here. When areas of our body are stimulated, our body doesn't know the difference between what is and isn't wanted and responds the way it is designed to.

&gt;An easier way to reframe this is to use the example of young children who are molested. There is little argument that a child ""enjoys"" a forced arousal and yet this is sadly a common feature of child sexual abuse.

 If you think that male sexual arousal is controlled 100% by the logical brain, what makes that different from women who are aroused during assault? How are men and women different in this case?"

eighthgear,anime,1390671582.0,"I think these early bits, with the class interactions, were where the manga was particularly strong, and SHAFT seems to be doing a great job adapting the material whilst adding a touch of their own style.

Also, they are spot on with the reaction faces. Some of the best ones I've seen since Hataraku Maou-sama.

I'm glad that they are plugging along through the manga at a pretty good pace, and I'm definitely glad that Onodera is getting quite a bit of screentime, though the latter is due to personal biases. Hanazawa Kana definitely nailed all of her dialogue this episode, especially the bit where Onodera freaks out about the key, and Tōyama Nao is a great tsundere, as usual.

The first episode of Nisekoi contained a lot of SHAFT flair in terms of art and animation, but they seem to have toned that down a bit in the past two episodes. I'm glad that they have done that. I love a lot of SHAFT works, but Nisekoi really isn't the type of story that needs such kind of flair every few minutes. I think the animators have done a great job keeping the atmosphere more realistic (relatively speaking) whilst still changing it a bit from the manga. The comedy is retained pretty much intact by the adaptation, which is good as well.

And with that, the wait for Tsugumi and Tachibana begins. I love Tachibana's character in the manga. I'm not a huge fan of Tsugumi, but she is being voiced by Komatsu Mikako (who did a great job as Totsuka Saika in OreGairu), and I'm really interested in seeing how that will play out.

Experience-wise, I can program some. I grew up with a Commodore 64 &amp; learned BASIC when I was pretty young, then went to a summer camp that taught PASCAL. I learned Java and some C in high school and do pretty well with them and with Virtual Basic.

Hatstrap,Games,1390672802.0,"AC series fanboy here.

Warning for excessive foul language.

If you're saying that you played AC3 as your first AC game, then I kinda feel sorry for you. AC3 was/is utter batshit. Connor is a three year old in the body of Great Khali, and the gameplay mechanics were taken out of a dead rats ass. You're not even a fuckin' assassin. You're a spawn of satan who feasts on killing sprees and combos. It ruined the AC series for me, atleast until Black Flag.

The setting wasn't good either. The earliet games was set in places unknown to almost everybody. You didn't know anything about the place, and it was exotic as hell. The Holy Land, Italy and Istanbul all offered very different experiences in almost the same place (compare Toscana to Rome) while AC3 had forests and towns, only. We all know how the forests are in the states. We've all heard about the native americans. But who has heard about a young Italian assassin?

Thanks for letting me vent my anger over AC3. When you said the third game, you probably  meant Brotherhood. Wich was the best game I've ever played.

To answer the question. GTA &amp;amp;lt;insert number&gt;. They are terrible. *shrugs*

It's a good game, has its pitfalls. If you're a fan of platformers, it borderlines on a must-play. The way they do the free-running system should have been an ignition to an entire genre of games that branched from it, but alas it only spawned the failed Brink and I believe Assassin's Creed. The combat is... janky at best, and sometimes the terrain-character interactions leave a little to be desired. And sometimes Faith makes some pretty bad decisions about which ledges to grab.


I've also been playing **Rogue Legacy**, which I have not beaten.

This is a good game, not really a rogue like but at least a semi-rogue like. The controls are simple enough, but sometimes maneuverability can be a bit... odd. Some of the hero classes seem unnecessary, and some of their ""special abilities"" leave a bit to be desired. I want to say it has tinges of artificial difficulty for a game like this (i.e. getting hit for full damage for touching an enemy that otherwise has an attack), but it could just be inner-dwelling rage. A couple of the bosses have elements that just don't make any sense in the fight, and a few things also just don't belong in the game (Curse of the Hedgehog, namely). Good game, but not flawless.

Healthcare is neither free nor a right.

Health insurance is single payer, and administered by the provinces (or the Feds in the cases of the territories and First Nations). We all pay into it, including those on employment insurance and welfare, albeit on a sliding scale according to income.

The main right within our health care is that it is transferrable no matter where you're in Canada, even visiting relatives in a different province, without any out of pocket expense or needing to file claims to get your expenses back.

The principle of single payer health insurance is not an explicit constitutional right, but it has been interpreted as part and parcel of a provision in the Charter pertaining to the right to ""life, liberty and security of the person"". Hospitals are run by non profit foundations, our doctors clinics are all private. We control the costs through monopolizing the insurance side, so that the province can't be charged a ridiculous amount for a CT scan for instance. It has to be reflective of the cost of equipment and labour.

I'm genuinely curious as to what you think this was, and how much of this conversation you have absorbed, so please do this one test for me.

&gt;Dealing with the issue of false rape is whats important

I don't get your angle here. You keep blatantly lying about what I said is if I'm going to somehow believe you. The text is still there, and I'm not fucking stupid. I never said false rape is what is important (in fact I specifically stated that it wasn't) I just tried to explain to you that that's what the quote was about. Then you tried to say that this **hypothetical** false claim was indeed rape, and I'm still not sure you quite understand that this is completely impossible no matter what rape definition you go by.

&gt;Your stance is very, very clear. You are strongly in defense of much put-upon men in a ""geno centric"" world. You have no problem with men who defend themselves against rapeable women, in reality or in the hypothetical, and when you're called upon to defend those views, you then deflect and insult and soften your position to the point of not making sense. You start strong and finish weak.

None of this entire section makes any fucking sense to me. I'm not even trying to make fun of you or your writing right now, I just honestly have no clue what you are trying to get across to me in this section.

And that position will put you at odds with overworked mental health professionals who are trained to deal with you but really don't want the bother. At the same time not all pros use the same methods for treatment, some are old fashioned talk or group talk stuff, but then there are those using up to date methods with provable results.  

One is CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy, and has the best results because it focuses on having the patient look at the words and self-talk (or cognition) that provokes physical responses.  Examining the words that guide you can help to understand how these things work. This works really well if your pain is nonbiological in origin, meaning your brain has been trained by behavior/environment to react in a certain way. 

Another way is the ACT, acceptance and commitment therapy, which works on having you accept your reactions, especially when they originate outside of your thought patterns. Meaning that most of your problems are biological problems that have now rewritten your brain. The brain is plastic and get changed by how you think, using mindfulness you can change how it gets rewritten.  This method relies on mindful meditation and acknowledging what is occurring.  This is the way that I am currently using as CBT didn't connect with my symptoms. Of course, I couldn't get to this without proper medication and prior mental exercises. 

Make sure that your psychologist/therapist is communicating with your psychiatrist.

Hell, for all you know your friend could have been the cause of the accident, and here you are being mad at pot. I agree that her brother should not have been driving stoned. When I smoke I don't drive until I'm confident in my ability to focus and evaluate situations with quick reflexes, which pretty much ends in me waiting until I'm sober. I'm not mad at you for hating marijuana, but I do think you should reevaluate the situation and realize that you weren't there, and thus do not know what happened or how it happened. If you can't do that you're doomed to a life of senseless hate, because what are you going to hate next? Food because your child gets fat from a sweet tooth, and then gets stuck someplace a skinnier child wouldn't? It's the foods fault, if not for food your child would have never been fat wouldn't have gotten stuck. 

See how that works? That's the logic used by mothers trying to sue McDonald's for making their children fat, when it's by their own neglect their kids are the way they are.

Edited to add...That sound of a belt on skin is a sound I know and still remember very well. I'm middle aged and I still can't watch a scene like that in a movie. I remember years ago, my SO and I were watching a film - honestly can't remember what it was, but some kid was getting punished with a belt. I noticed my SO looking at me funny, and he paused the movie and said ""You know that every time the kid get hit, you flinch?"" No, I didn't. It was such an ingrained response that I was completely unaware of it. It took (two mediocre husbands and) a fantastic boyfriend before I could stop flinching whenever a man raised his hand around me.

FreyjaSunshine,medicine,1390674682.0,"I chose my profession because I peeked over the drapes during my surgery rotation in medical school.  The anesthesia folks looked a lot happier than the surgery residents.  To be fair, everybody looked happier than the surgery residents, but I liked the OR environment and that sort of limits specialty choice.

So I did a rotation in anesthesia and just loved it.  We get to manipulate physiologic functions, stick needles pretty much anywhere, lots of hands-on patient care, a little bit of excitement now and then but not too much... it just fit my personality.

What we do looks boring to outsiders.  It's not much of a spectator sport like surgery is.  But there's a lot going on inside my head to craft the perfect anesthetic for each particular patient, procedure and surgeon.  We have to anticipate what's going to happen and be ready for pretty much anything.

A lot of what we do is magic.  We know it works, but we're not quite sure *how* it works.  It's difficult to define consciousness, yet we spend our days taking people in and out of it.

I get to be a comfort to people in times of stress, which is nice.  I can make obnoxious patients stop their whining, which is also nice!

No overhead, no office hours, when a case is done, it's done.  Few problems with non-compliance.  Wide variety of patients, from newborns to elderly, healthy to very sick.

For a basic melee attack (and some powers, depending on your class) with a longsword, you would roll a d20, then add 3 for your strength, then add 3 for your proficiency modifier. That means that at level 1, facing the opponent, not using powers, you would have a median roll of 16, and an average level 1 monster AC is 15, so you would have a 55% chance to hit.

That's not counting bonuses from using powers or hitting a dazed monster or flanking a monster or having magic items. A level 1 character could find a +1 longsword, and be flanking a monster (+2), and the monster may be dazed by an effect (+2), and you might be using the fighter power *Sure Strike* (+2), thus giving you a median roll of 23, meaning you'd hit it 90% of the time.

Honestly, if you are just starting out then MiniSynth seems really good, and sounds great - you wouldn't need Harmor over that except for some of the more advanced features and you will learn the basics much better with something simpler.

Harmor is great, but I feel FM synthesis is a lot better for making unique and interesting bass sounds, whereas additive is better for leads and pads. Try learning how to make some FM reese bass and Growls and you'll be well on the way to making decent sounding dubstep songs. Harmor is very powerful, but unless you know how to use it it's a wasted investment."

The_White_Baron,IAmA,1390675503.0,"So I'm a little late to this party, so pardon me if it's already been asked.

When I get to talking sexual types of things with a girl, often the topic of rape gets brought up. Many times, she will say something to the effect of a ""rape fantasy"". Obviously nobody *wants* to get raped, but I think there's some parallel in the power play--being absolutely submissive to the whims of another is an idea that arouses some people. 

I think it's important to distinguish this from having a stranger have their way with you. I can't help but feel there's the same biological trigger going on though for arousal.

Anyway, I'm wondering how you feel the two topics relate, if at all, and whether having these notions of submissive rape-like fantasies hinders how seriously we take real rape victims. If it does hinder it, what can be done? It clearly can't be a good idea to police what people find arousing."

hylandw,DnD,1390675881.0,"I have limited sailing experience, but with period ships, I'm assuming they have sails.

In that case, you baton down the hatches (literally, that's where the saying comes from, you use a baton, or wooden stick/pole, to seal hatches shut) and lower the sails. On a small ship, that takes between one and two minutes, but it takes much longer on a large ship, up to 5 minutes, since you would be taking down many large sails.

In bad weather, ships are somewhat maneuverable, but it would be really, really stupid to try and sail through a storm instead of trying to survive it. Experienced sailors would know how to avoid one, but in any case if you were stuck in one, the smart thing to do would be to wait it out, with a maximum of people below deck, and anyone who has to be outside tied to the masts.

You want to be facing the waves. If you're sideways or diagonal, you risk tipping. Fun fact: If you're in a kayak, because of how easy it is to shift your body weight, it doesn't matter because you can keep yourself righted and if you start to fall you can move in a way that you flip back up.

http://startmyporncompany.com/?tag=where-is-it-legal-to-shoot-porn

Although, I know it wasn't legal in Dallas while Vivid was here and they worked anyway.

My advice would be to make comedic shorts or interesting short films out of the porns. Think of all the youtube sketch stuff out there, and then add fucking. Get creative with it, get surreal, make it so the sex is just like any other performance - dance/acrobatics/etc. Put it on the table and say ""this is okay.""

I wrote a porn movie last fall just for fun, and was thinking about hiring a girl (some porn actresses are on modelmayhem, like Keegan Monroe) and shooting it as a gift to my girlfriend. After I was done scripting it I realized that no one out there does what I want to see - they don't make short porn videos about normal fantasies or real-world sex. They're mostly all  stereotypical scenarios, parodies, or ""here's this girl watch me fuck her."" Those can be fun and all, but sometimes it's really nice to just watch people have sex because they enjoy the sex, not because they're pretending to. Who am I to tell them what to make? I just know that if I were producing adult movies, I'd throw in some really practical fantasies &amp; stuff I've actually daydreamed about instead of ""Okay she appears in the shower because she's a ghost, starts giving him head, and the lighting and music start kickin it like an 80s club."" That's cheese.

I found some Czech porn that was really cool. I forget the name of it and I'm not on my normal computer so I can't access the files, but it revolved around a guy's POV, having a party for a large group of girls. All real-world stuff, no acting. They're all prostitutes of course, in real life, but in the video they're just girls hanging out at an awesome house drinking and dancing. Except he would go about the night talking to them, then pulling them into the bedroom and having sex with them. Like 2-3 girls a video, which lasted about an hour. That's a practical scenario for me. It's unrealistic, but how many times have you been to a party and thought ""I would bang all three of those girls,"" and imagine you could just pull them into another room and enjoy each other?

The guy did a whole series of those videos, and the name is some ungodly Czech word. I'll find it later.

The point here isn't ""what I like will sell,"" I'm just pointing out some style of content that isn't being made by brazzers, or bang bros, etc.

“The Enclave maintained a number of bases throughout the country, with the strongest concentration of their forces historically being the Core Region and the Capital Wasteland. Enclave bases make use of the best security technologies available. Forcefields are common passive defenses, while plasma turrets and auto-cannons are common stationary defensive emplacements. Enclave patrols are a common defensive measure, including anywhere between three and five troopers armed with high powered weapons.

Apart from the oil rig and Navarro, the Enclave had locations and bases hidden throughout the Core Region, however, their status after the destruction of the oil rig is not known.[85][86]”"
DangerAndAdrenaline,KerbalSpaceProgram,1390676139.0,"Imagine that you are holding a dinner plate, holding it at the edges using only pressure from one finger on each hand.

The plate can flip end over end, but not rotate like a frisbee.

When you burn ascending or descending, you are flipping the dinner plate of your orbit.

When you are trying to match the inclination of another orbit, there is only 1 place where your fingers could rest on opposite sides of the dinner plate to get the same angle. That's where the ascending and decending nodes are.

Take a plate from home and prop it up on something so its at an angle.

Now hold another plate next to it but keep this plate level.

Where do you have to place your fingers in order to get the same angle on your two plates?

Notice how there is only one place?"

iammas13,nfl,1390676155.0,"Essentially, the QB is the manager of the game. For the past 20 or so years, with the exceptions of a few qbs (like trent dilfer) the team that won the super bowl has had an elite or very high level QB. Playing in the playoffs means playing against the best offenses, defenses, and so on. Playing in the super bowl means youre playing against the best team(or second best team.) And then if you win that, it means you lead your team to be the best. 

Personally, I think QB's get too much credit and too much blame, but I believe the amount of super bowls should definitely determine how good a QB is. Personally, I think 2 super bowls determines whether or not you had a great career, with the exception of players like Peyton Manning(possibly could change after next week) Dan Marino, and Jim Kelly.

MattAdams53,NLCentral,1390676478.0,"Justifications

Joey Votto - His job is to create runs, and to do that you have to get on base. He's the best at that in the NL.

Matt Carpenter - After having a breakout season in 2013, he looks poised to repeat another big season at his natural position

Matt Holliday - [He's always the same fucking hitter,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cardinals/comments/1w3mmw/mlb_network_top_10_right_now_bill_james_ranks/ceyi5qp) and he's one of the best LF in baseball.

Jay Bruce - Let's just say that when the Cardinals are playing, I check the line up to make sure Bruce isn't playing.

Carlos Gomez - While all of us were paying attention to Andrew McCutchen, Gomez quietly had one of the best seasons for a center fielder. The deciding factor from Gomez vs McClutch? Gomez is the better defender.

Yadier Molina - Arguably the best catcher in MLB.

Jhonny Peralta - This one is hard. He's the SS with the highest bWAR in 2013, but I haven't seen him play. 

Neil Walker - He's a guy that quietly does his job, and isn't a total blackhole at the bottom of the line up. Best bWAR out of the 2B (Matt Carpenter is moving to 3B this year)"

Her internal conflict about who she is and who she wants to be always kept her in a state of conflict, and when you can't be at peace with yourself internally, you lose the ability to let people in enough to really love them.

AnotherCrazyOne,apple,1390677147.0,"What I like about OS X now is that they are incorporating things we do on iOS without the iOS GUI. Maps, notification center, etc., let us get things done but with a desktop GUI. This I think is great and how it should be done. Some mobile tasks and apps, not only Apple made ones, are important enough and done well enough that they do justify their own spot on the desktop. Keeping the two operating systems separate keeps things simple and intelligent by design.

The feature that MS puts out there with Windows 8.1 that is a two GUI system is just that, a feature. It's not a very well executed feature either. It's a mashup of smaller features that are disjointed. It seems Microsoft put this out on the market to see what people would like and dislike, using us as testers rather than actually thinking about what would be best for users.

Microsoft, Android, etc., all primarily have their development set on commodity features. Apple however seeks to improve, focus and refine the overall experience a user has with whatever device they are using in a unified way. Apple considers the people using their devices and what they're gonna do with them. The others offer RAM, hard drive space, buy one get one free, options that are more novel than useful, etc. Others think in terms of commodity. Apple thinks in terms of human interface.

There's no reason that makes sense to merge OS X and iOS as they are, nothing that would make the user experience better than it already is. If anything it would make it worse. My own use of Windows 8.1 has me stripping out as much of Metro as possible to use only the desktop.

If one looks at the roots of any mobile OS we'll find full blown desktop technologies that have been reduced, redesigned and re-engineered to work on something in the palm of our hands. Taking a desktop OS, making it mobile and then turning around and putting the smaller mobile OS back on the desktop dilutes experience and usefulness. Putting a mobile OS alongside a desktop OS as Windows 8.1 does is distracting. It's an impediment to a smooth, unified workflow.

Apple has this argument won without needing to even enter the debate."

If I do switch majors to CE I will have to take a course in it anyway, hopefully with the same instructor. Java was just the first ""modern"" language I ever learned, so I had a lot of time to practice with it.

I will be making a decision on changing majors over the summer, based upon my grades and level of understanding in the math &amp; physics courses I plan to take. After that, I will see what I can do as far as work, coops, etc. I'm in work study right now, but it's nothing that actually relates to anything (checking pdf files scanned into a records database), and have a co-op requirement in 2 of my majors, but it usually ends up being ""support"" in our school computer lab. I plan on asking around for something more useful, and am trying to work out a real internship for my coop credit rather than sitting in the computer lab showing people how to open zip files and work a printer. I also assume there will be more opportunities available once I transfer to a 4-year school that actually does research. 

Locally, we have a lot of factories and a several large tech companies have recently opened or plan to open data centers nearby, and I have put out feelers for internship opportunities at several of those. A friend who works at one of the data centers has also encouraged me to study CE and said he can probably get me on there as a temp or evening shift employee in another year.

What the shit? Are you just typing nonsense? 

The bail-outs are bailouts because no rational private investor would give you sorry bankrupt asses any money. By ""usury levels"", do you mean ""far below market rate""?

&gt;Germany has and will profit hundreds of billions from these ""bail-outs"" over the next 50 years so do not act like you are doing anyone but yourself favors here. 

Only if Greece pays back. And if Greece pays back, the interest on those loans will be far below what the lenders could have expected given the risk. Any way you look at it, they are losing money.

skgoa,formula1,1390678560.0,"Noses like on the BGP001 or what Ferrari ran for several years produce downforce. That was a benefit back when the front wing was so narrow and at the back were these huge rear wings and diffusers. The cars were limited by their front downforce. The teams were allowed to use narrow noses, as e.g. Renault did in 2005.

But after 2008 the front wing was made much wider, while rear wing and diffuser were reduced quite drastically. Brawn and a couple of other teams got around that during the 2009 season by using the *technically legal* double decked diffuser. But from then on the cars were always rear limited and getting more air to the back of the car became an ever higher priority. 

By banning the exhaust blown diffusers *and* the beam wing, the FIA have now made the cars even weaker (aerodynamically) at the back, which is why the teams are now trying to design their noses in such a way that the air is obstructed the least while still fulfilling the minimum requirement in the regulations.

Polyamory is distinct from those in its very definition, which is generally defined as ""being open to more than one romantic relationship at a time, in which everyone involved is aware"".  If the open/honest part doesn't play into it, it's not polyamory - it's cheating.  Polyamory has defined itself as a movement in opposition to cheating.  You can't just decide any form of non-monogamy can be called polyamory and use that to claim that it's existed throughout all of human history.

I know it's upsetting to find he's watching porn after he's rejected sex with you, but masturbation and sex are different things that fulfill different needs.  While I understand firsthand how awful it makes you feel when it's clear he's got SOMETHING going on in his pants but it's not directed at you, the issue should be separate if possible.  If he's consistently rejecting you, that's what you have to deal with.  The porn may be a factor in why, or it might not, but you're better off addressing the root problem - him rejecting you consistently - than trying to control his masturbation habits."

Basically, respite care exists to give a break to the full time caregiver's of someone with special needs.

I have a bachelor in psych and criminology. My company hires me as an independent provider to clients I show interest in. I meet with the respite coordinator and then with the individual seeking services to ensure that we are a match. 

As for what's involved with respite, that depends on the client's needs. 

I can assist a client under the age of 18 by being out in the community with them, doing prosocial activities. I can also help a client by supervising household chores (so the family doesn't have to) twice a week. Some support is given in the home, and caregivers can leave during that time. Sometimes support is outside of the home, where the caregiver also gets a break.

It really varies from contract to contract. I hope that helps!"

Yeah the seat and handlebars are about 6"" above the frame, but the seat has a shock built in. 

I also did a long bike tour on a older Trek that I had bought new.  The thing about Treks/Giants is that you can get the largest sizes on the cheaper models, which puts them into a few hundred dollar range. Personally I'm not made of cash and since I live in an area where bikes get stolen, I keep my bikes in the lower dollar range.

I've been looking at recumbents but they are outrageously expensive for anything that would fit or I'd have to go custom. Or the other idea is to build my own. Still thinking about that.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390679764.0,"He's 40.  You have to deal with the reality of dating a 40 year old man.

You don't say how often you DO have sex now, but you say you still have it, but ""just not as much as before"" and you've been together around a year?  The NRE (new relationship energy) has worn off.  That means the crazy stomach in your chest butterflies amazing chemical DRUG that our bodies produce to get us to HOOK UP and have babies has faded, as it always does, no matter how much people love each other.  Generally NRE lasts 3-12 months (seems to be the more time you spend together, the faster it goes away - if you move in with someone at 6 months, it's going to go away faster than if you only see each other on weekends).  When NRE fades you're hopefully left with a great friendship, a loving commitment to each other, and sexual desire for each other, but it's not going to be ""the same"" as before overall.

And then he's 40.  Late 30s is when many men start to experience their sex drive ebbing away a bit.  There's physical reasons for this - men produce less testosterone as they age.  This means that he's not going to spontaneously desire sex as much as he did as a horndog guy in his teens through his 20s.  It also means erections may not come as readily as they did before.  This doesn't mean he has a medical problem, or that he isn't attracted to you, it means he's a 40 year old guy.  (If he consistently cannot get an erection it may be time to see a doctor).

Don't make his erections about how attractive you are, for starters.  Making a guy feel bad about failing to get it up will create the anxiety death spiral that means it's harder for him to get it up in the future.  If he's willing to get you off, take that as a compliment.  Aren't there times where you're not down for intercourse but are happy to give him a blowjob?  It's the same thing!

Try to separate the transition from NRE to a more mature, long-term relationship from your sexual anxiety and figure out if there's REALLY a problem here.  I'm not convinced there is.  "

Edit:  I really didn't think this comment would be so controversial.  I'm coming from the perspective of someone with mental illness who uses healthcare services on a regular basis.  I see the frustration of my disadvantaged friends in the US and feel deeply for them, not having the same issues accessing care here in Canada.  I honestly don't understand the disagreement with this statement.  Do you not feel for your fellow countrymen who are experiencing hardship because of your poor social services?  It's fine for the wealthy but I know you're not all wealthy.  I don't think you should compare yourselves with third world countries; I think you should compare yourselves with countries that are doing a better job of looking after their citizens."

But what you are describing sounds more like a stomach issue rather than ""withdrawal symptoms"". 

You didn't mention anything about cravings, usually that's the first tell all we are addicted to something. Our brain is no longer reacting to the incoming THC and it reacts to this if it used to being flooded with it. Where did you go on a trip? Did you drink the tap water there? THC is circulating in your blood stream and is stored in fats and so I doubt in such a short time that this is a THC withdrawal.

egcharood51,socialskills,1390679972.0,"Actual, literal eye contact - as in, looking directly at a person's eyes, is not meant to be maintained for more than a few seconds at a time. Sustained eye contact is usually reserved for intimate relationships. 

Even looking at a person's face (not necessarily their eyes) should not be consistently maintained. That becomes staring and will come across as creepy. Instead, you should only glance at a person's face or eyes for a few seconds at a time, and then look away. Go ahead and let your eyes move around. Looking away consistently will come across as not paying attention, but intermittent looking is perfect."

travelingmama,Parenting,1390680919.0,"You state that she won't listen, but are you listening to her? I recently read Parent Effectiveness Training and I cannot recommend this book enough. The first step is active listening. Decoding your child's messages without judgment so that they feel listened to. ""Let's eat dinner, NO I DON'T LIKE DINNER!"" you would respond with, ""You don't want to stop what you're doing to eat huh"". Stop and listen to her response. She will calm down enough that you can give her an I message, ""I get nervous when you don't eat because I'm afraid you will get hungry after we have put all the food away and won't have anything to eat."" 
This is just one example, this book really explains how to properly communicate with your child and why this method of logical communication will actually cause your children to take responsibility for their problems and be more influenced by you. 

I used to believe love and logic was the answer and it definitely does have some answers, but time outs are bullshit. They absolutely do not work on my son no matter how consistent I am and it makes parenting incredibly miserable. Your daughter sounds JUST like my son and I wish I knew about PET back then.

On the topic of free actions, an action point grants an extra standard action. A standard action can be exchanged for a move action or a minor action. Thus, you could, with your regular turn, use two moves and a minor, or three minors, using the action point as a standard. It's the same as having an extra action on your turn.

Although the second and third are technically true, I would never allow it. I would allow an action point for doing two encounters without a short rest (With one, you're basically refreshed, and if you're facing a level encounter you won't use many healing surges). Also, thus, your players could, as they gain levels, just hoard action points until they're using one every single encounter."

You can't keep someone with you by marrying them. Divorce is a thing.

You can't get honesty from someone in that position. A person desperate enough to sell herself into that sort of one person prostitution will tell you anything she thinks you'll want to hear in order to get every material advantage you represent.

This is not love. It is not marriage. It is not going to make you a good man or make you a good husband.

All it is is legal indentured servitude/prostitution.

I had to look up what to do because I couldn't find the small key i needed when it was in a room hidden under a block in the center tower.

temp9876,AskReddit,1390681080.0,"I was a smart kid and my parents had very high expectations as a result.  Trouble is, every kid has weaknesses.  There were a few areas that I just did not get, no matter how hard I tried I was only ever going to pull of average grades in physics.  If I tried hard and failed it was always my fault, I hadn't tried hard enough, I was lazy.  I was held to higher standards because of what I was perceived to be capable of.  It left me with a fear of failure that leads me not to try unless I am confident I can succeed. 

I was also not really taught to deal with my emotions properly, I was simply taught I should contain them.  This one is a mixed bag, because I could probably have been pretty psycho if I hadn't learned to control my temper and such, but it has definitely added to me being pretty cold and calculating. Luckily I also have my dad's very high ethical standards deeply ingrained, because apparently I would otherwise be a certifiable psychopath.

All that said, in retrospect, my parents did the best they could with a troubled kid.  I have my own now and I have absolutely no fucking clue what I'm doing or how to be the parent he needs and all I can hope is that it works out as well for him as it did for me in the grand scheme of things.  "

naked_as_a_jaybird,penguins,1390681427.0,"Great discussion point. 

My first reaction is looking to our IR squad. Obviously Duper is out for the rest of the regular season, so we can glaze over him here. Joey Vitale (wrist) should be coming back after the Olympic break, so there's an improvement to the roster. The same goes for Brian Gibbons (lower body injury). Beau Bennett (wrist surgery) should also be coming back soon. 

That being said, a healthy roster of players coming back isn't going to put a winger on Sid's line. Bennett coming back is probably going to demote Jussi to the third line, but really, who the hell knows? I would like to see 14-87-19 on the first with 36-71-18 on the second. Let Pyatt-Sutter-Megna stay on the third line and get some chemistry. I like all three of those guys and I think they can be as effective  as any third line out there with speed, talent, and shut-down ability. Yes, I still miss Staalsy.

A trade will put a winger on Sid's line, but when Dupuis comes back, where does said winger play from then on out? Let's say we trade (solely for the sake of argument) Vitale &amp; Bortuzzo for Evander Kane. The line for the rest of the season is Kunitz-Crosby-Kane. Then we have Bennett-Malkin-Neal with Pyatt-Sutter-Jokinen (or swap Beau &amp; Jussi). There's no place for Duper when he comes back. 

If GMRS makes a trade, whether before or after Sochi, it will be for a talented player. I don't think any acclimation is going to be necessary. We have a great team, we just need to work on team defense. Fill in the blanks here: ________ wins games, but _________ wins championships. We have a ton of offense, but we need to work on winning 2-1 games, and closing out teams when we have them against the wall."

dreamingofjellyfish,AskWomen,1390681528.0,"&gt;It's not the users' desperation that causes the violence. It's the fact that no boundaries are set by the authorities, 

So, I'm basically arguing the exact opposite. I don't actually thing deregulation would rapidly allow gun battles between gas station owners (total social collapse might). Conversely, the nature physical addiction is that it creates a need that overwhelms social or personal moral constraints.

I do agree that with regulated sale we could probably hit some minimum violence level, but I think that could also be reached with effective policing and social policy that outlaws these substances. I find it unacceptable to shot for a minimal level of violence created by regulation, given the other social impacts that would come with legalizing highly addictive compounds."

3 weeks in primary may be a bit much. Two weeks is my staple. If you check the gravity with a hydrometer, it'll be ready to take out of primary when the gravity stops increasing. Secondary is helpful for clarity or adding flavors, but not needed for ordinary beer.

My dad grew up in and around Chicago. He made a friend in elementary school &amp; they used to hang out every day until the kid moved away.

Fast forward a few years later, my dad's family moves again (about ~20 miles this time) and this kid shows up in a few of his high school classes one day. Fast forward yet again... my dad joined the Marines and was off fighting in Vietnam. His squad had stopped to take a break in an area where other squads had also stopped.

Xenos have a chitinous skin that can stop most modern firearms.

with their tail they can attack from a little longer than spear range, they can climb on walls and ceilings, and their inner tongue can penetrate a predator mask and skull.

the only way the knight is going to realistically win is impaling 
the alien through the body as it pounces, and at that point if it does not die instantly its a draw because it can just brain the knight.

dreamingofjellyfish,AskWomen,1390682031.0,"&gt;I'm convinced that a salon/spa has more in common with a strip club than Chippendale's does.

Not if the point is to feel arousal, rather than being the object of desire.

I think your point is more what do women do when they want to feel female camaraderie and also possibly aroused/confident/desirable. If it's really about seeing hot guys and getting aroused the answer is still strip clubs and possibly movies, bars, or dance clubs. 

The salon/spa is more about feeling pampered. There can be a side effect of feeling more desirable because of some beauty-focused treatment. But it's not the same as looking at hot guys. The spa can be about making yourself an object of desire, which is not the same as looking at/interacting with your object of desire to get aroused or have a confidence boost.

I think that in a ""vanilla setting"" if you live outside a really socially liberal big city, it's going to be assumed most people don't know about polyamory or even about open relationships - maybe they've just heard about swinging.  

Most people are not going to continue to flirt with someone who has an existing relationship, even if they're open.  

At the same time, trying to turn people poly is often disastrous.  If you wait until there's clear infatuation/NRE going on and then spring it on them, they might decide to try to tolerate it but are likely going to have a difficult time.  

I think it's fine to ask them out, but it's probably best to disclose during that date.  Once they have shown interest, but before they really get TOO into you."

&gt; to me it basically just means ""without a publisher"".

If a game doesn't have a publisher, how would you ever get to play it?

There are self-published indie games, but that just means the developer is also the publisher.  Valve is the publisher for their own games.  EA is the publisher for the games they make in-house.  So, you can't really say that publishing your own games makes you indie.

And lots of independent developers find publishers to publish their games after their finished.  That IS still Indie, even if it's published by Microsoft.

The key is the resources.  If you develop it without deep pockets, without anyone pulling the strings, then it's indie.  Starbound, Forced, or Minecraft are great example of indie games.  Even though Notch is lining his closets with money today, he built the game on a shoestring."

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390682649.0,"My perspective is that there's NRE and there's long term sexual chemistry, and the two are fairly different but can appear the same early in a relationship.

A lot of women date guys they don't have sexual chemistry with, because the NRE simulates the sexual interest early on, and by the time it wears off they're in love with them, but the sexual part has died out.  (I think that's a lot of the LL women that some of the guys here are married to, tbh).  

And yet there's also the fact that good sex in an LTR is something that requires work and maintenance, and if you stop having sex with a partner because the NRE feelings that made you horny for him have worn off, you're not going to be able to get it back unless you continue having sex anyway.

Miss_anthropyy,ThePopcornStand,1390682963.0,"Yeah, you definitely don't spend much time in the scene.  There is a fuckton of drama and consent is absolutely not clear-cut at ALL.  Especially if you're playing with someone for the first time.  You can also be put into situations and positions where you are unable to consent.  When you get into edge play, or into situations where you actually give consent for your consent to be broken (not recommended for beginners) you've got lots and lots of gray area.

For example, say I and my partner decide to do an edge play scene where we're treading the boundaries.  I'm tied up with rope, gagged, completely immobilized, while he paddles, flogs, whips, and generally beats me, perhaps burns me, and then proceeds to fuck me brutally.  Sounds like a great night.  Perhaps, however, I have a change of heart.  He went a bit too far, it wasn't what I expected, I didn't like it.  I go to police and describe what happened.  I have ligature marks, bruises, burns, and evidence of being brutally violated sexually.  What do you think happens?

There is nowhere in the US where you can consent to being battered, AFAIK.  It is an area completely not addressed by the law, and by current legal theory, *you cannot consent to be harmed.*  

In fact, even if you were to sign a contract, as some play partners do, that can actually be used in court *against the perpetrator* because it acknowledges the illegal activity and has your signature right there, handy-dandy.

dizziik,RBA,1390682992.0,"You're probably shorting on the SS mesh. Do you have another type of wick you could try? I've heard good things about the Kraken with cotton. If you do use SS mesh the wraps need to be flush and very tight to prevent shorts.

Also with 28g you will need more than 6 wraps to hit 1Ω. The thicker your kanthal, the less resistance it has so you have to use more. 

And just to be sure, you are testing the resistance *before* trying to fire it right?  "
V2Blast,community,1390682993.0,"Best episode of the season so far. Probably one of the best of the show so far.

I loved the ending goodbye sequence... And the tag with LeVar Burton, too. And most of the episode. Britta was great this episode (as were Troy and Abed, of course).

I love this show :)"
