If they were all in the same friend group and stayed friends throughout, I can see what you are saying. But if they weren't, I assume they led themselves down that road of developing feelings through their own motivation. They hung out in situations alone with their friend's ex and welcomed whatever flirting occurred, when it was easily avoidable and unnecessary, especially if they didn't remain in their group of friends. Most of the time you have to put yourself in the position where strong enough feelings can develop."

susiedotwo,changemyview,1388808459.0,"I'm not saying it's not a great measure of *upper* body strength but it certainly is not a good overall standard. I suppose I could have worded that better, since my implied meaning was overall strength, not just upper body. 

People who cannot do pull ups (men and women alike) are not necessarily in bad physical condition. There are many incredibly fit people who cannot do pull ups (men and women alike, although granted there are many more women who cannot) You must be in good physical condition to do a pull up (generally speaking) you must have sufficiently low body mass and sufficiently high musculature, but, but I would not call the ability to do a pull up a hallmark of physical fitness. A girl I know who is an arialist could climb a rope using only her arms because of her training, but when she started playing rugby with me she had to work really hard to keep up with the amount of running that we did. This is anecdotal, but the example stands.

The ability to do a pull up does not indicate overall good fitness, there are multiple ways, and particularly for women, and some might argue for men.  

edit: i looked at the article you linked. The guy makes some excellent points regarding the benefits of pull ups as a part of a work out, but it doesn't really help a person who cannot already do a pull up."

Breal3030,askscience,1388808676.0,"/r/SkincareAddiction is a great resource, and will probably be able to answer your question better. They have a sidebar with tons of beginner information on ingredients and routines, and they pride themselves in being strictly science-based.

Face washes for both of those ingredients are generally considered to be much less effective than lotions or other topical applications, because they aren't in contact with your skin long enough, or often in the case of salicylic acid, the product isn't at the proper pH to work.

Beyond things like that, the biggest things to consider are the other ingredients in formulations. Some may be comedogenic or irritating or drying to skin, for example. 

There is a long list of things that can do this that you have to read the label and watch out for, you can't assume that many popular companies have actually put the proper thought into this, and perhaps most importantly, everyone's skin reacts differently to different stuff.

Stridex alcohol-free for example, is recommended a ton on /r/SkincareAddiction, but the menthol in it irritates a lot of people. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (the most common liquid detergent in cleansers) causes problems for a lot of people, and so on. You have to find what works for you.

Once you exhaust those, if you even remember this exchange, I would be glad to recommend some films that might not appear on them.  Not to brag, but I know a few gems that seem not to have registered on the major radars.  That said, if you start with the ""best of"" lists of, *e.g.*, AFI and BFI, you probably will find your way to anything I might recommend with a modicum of enthusiasm and effort."

Vorsa,DotA2,1388809059.0,"Wait.. This happened? And because of shitty community feedback? Let's take a step back here...

Have a look at Rugby. There's 1 referee on the field and 2 assistant referees who are in the wings. 

That one guy is surrounded by 30 men made out of 100% biceps. He's surrounded by, at times, upwards of 10,000+ screaming, drunk fans and being watched by thousands more at home. He has to walk up to these [Litteral hulking masses of men](http://blog.lovell-rugby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cid_58C88C9A-A6A3-429A-81F6-7D611419BD89@lovell-rugby.jpg) and make them pay the consequences if they fuck up. 

Guess what these raging, testosterone fuelled mad men who [don't give a fuck and keep playing even if they're bleeding and concussed] (http://static2.fjcdn.com/comments/I+don+t+think+he+heard+because+of+the+blood+flowing+_ebdce7e27f573b1b00c3c1abdd68234d.jpg) do when the ref throws them off the pitch? They say ""Ok sir, sorry sir"", take the hit and get on with the game. 

* They chat back? Sin Bin.
* They argue? Sin Bin.
* They threaten? Game ban.
* Do the referees get lynched? No. 
* Are the referees respected by player and fan alike? Yes. 

Why? Because they're following and enforcing the fucking rules, which is fair on everyone.

There's a lot to be learned here on all sides. 

***Players:***

* Get your shit together. If you're late, you face the fucking consequences, be that disqualification or whatever else.
* You're playing for a team. If your team consists of people who aren't in your team (Be that 1 or 5 of your players), you're not playing in your team any more. You should be disqualified.  
 
***Admins***
    
* You run this shit. You make the rules. If you don't want to enforce rules, then don't have them, see how far that will get you. If your rules are broken and shitty, fix them. 
* Start respecting the e-sport you're hosting. Do not treat it like some cash-cow. Do it properly or get the fuck out the game.
* The community is entitled to everything below and you need to respect it, and not fear it:

***Community***

* Every single sporting scene on the planet is filled with people who don't like decisions made by the people who run and organise the sport they love. You are well within your rights to bitch, moan, complain and full on rage stomp the fuck out of the entire internets about any decision or result, it's just passion and there's fuck all wrong with passion. 
* BUT. To have this privilege, *you* need to help make the professional scene more professional. Slate the fuck out of teams who don't turn up or have players that aren't actually part of their team, complain about the organisers who don't enforce rules or make the other team make the shitty decisions. **THESE are the things that will destroy the e-sport you love.**

I worked at a movie theater and a few of my co-workers and I would go into a dark theater at about 3 a.m. and use the Ouija board.  We ended up talking to a ""spirit"" named Heather. One of my co-workers was pretty religious and decided to ask it if it was a demon, and it replied ""yes"". My co-worker then said ""Jesus loves you"" and it started to freak out. It started spelling curse words and started going in a figure eight shape. At that point we took the planchette off, turned the board upside down and called it a night.

After we opened the gateway the theater was never the same. It was always pretty chilly and weird sounds would echo through the halls. I feel very lucky that nothing followed me home after all those Ouija board experiences (there were plenty more times when we ""played"" with the board). Even though I'm not very religious, I always like to think God is there with me when something creepy starts to happen and that he is stronger than whatever the fuck is messing with me.

As we took in the scene, we found an older gentleman who was relating the scene to a young immigrant family that didn't understand the significance, and a kid that was 10 or so was learning about the Jesus story.  

It hit me that as much as that kid was learning about Christianity, kids being raised Christian should be learning about Muslim, Hindu Jewish and other faiths because they'll likely encounter those people as adults.

BP problems are a big culprit and weight loss is a great beginning on that.

There are also psycho problems with loss of confidence/worry that kill erections dead. 

This is similar to many women who need a certain amount of tranquility to be aroused enough to come.

The problem will not go away without both of you being willing to do the necessary. Him most of all to keep a positive attitude and do the medical recommendations.

dewprisms,changemyview,1388810272.0,"I don't think very many people would argue that killing animals for sustenance, shelter, and protection from the elements isn't worse than having sex with them because it literally ends their life. So yes, in that sense it's not ""as bad"". But that's really only measuring ""badness"" based on the fact that in one scenario the animal isn't alive anymore- if that's the base qualifier there are tons of things you should be outraged over.

However, all 3 of those things (food, shelter, protection) *have a purpose* beyond just having the desire to do something to another animal. They give us (or have given us historically) nutrients we need. Provide materials to live in. Components for clothing to keep us protected.

Simply having sex with an animal because you desire to has no real benefit aside from a sexual release, and that's something you can get with your own hand. It's literally using animals for your own fancies and it confers no benefits that are *necessary* to life.

Gay marriage confers benefits to partners in a legal and societal sense. Beastiality does neither of these things. To compare them really doesn't even make sense. In one example both parties are human. And while I don't buy into the whole ""humans are MORE IMPORTANT AND BETTER!"" belief that many have about humans vs. animals, it does need to be acknowledged that humans are *different* than other animals in very profound ways.

A relationship between two people of the same sex in no way compares to a human who chooses to engage in sexual acts with another species. So while it may not ""affect you"" either way, that doesn't automatically mean that ""because X does not affect me, and neither does Y, why is Y not okay if X is?"" is a sound argument."

I've worked with two shelters in my area (our metro is around 1.8 million) that have pet fostering programs in place, and have fostered cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters and a snake before, so just know the programs *do* exist. 

Obviously check into this without alerting your partner, or have a friend look into it for you if your phone/internet is being watched/monitored.

Every situation is unique of course and I don't mean to generalize, sometimes people may want some help with these situations, but I don't assume that they do.

At -30 C (22 below zero F) the short straw was the guy who had to go outta the shack at the end of day and do the final sweep. Minus 30 F is insane to ski in.

I have done it and I assure you it is rotten skiing, the snow is like concrete, your skis won't carve on the ice, and any injury becomes a life threatening situation if it needs to take time to get you off the hill. 

Just think of the wind chill factor as your skis rattle over the chunks of ice that used to be snow. An easy effective minus fifty or worse.

I wore foam insulated outer mitts at those temperatures with gloves inside. Also a hood, goggles, scarf around the head, sweater under the down filled parka, and warm up pants over the warm up pants.

My feet were the least well protected from cold.

So - a reasonable temperature for skiing is around minus 10 to minus 1 Celsius or from 30 F to about 0 F where the cold is enough to prevent too much slush, and the snow can be carved.

Racing style gloves did it for me on those days. the palm side spent most time around the pole, and the outer side had thick foam insulation to prevent injury from the slalom gates, and heat loss from the wind.

I know it seems commonplace, but shaking someone's hand is absolutely a valid way of beginning a physical interaction with someone.

Actually, it doesn't seem commonplace at all. I don't ever shake hands with people my age, or see them shaking hands with one another. That's something I do with older people. To me that seems stiff and formal.

&gt; Introductions aside, once you are getting into conversation you should make a point of touching her on the outside of her arm between her elbow and shoulder. Do this every few minutes. If you are going to state something that you feel is important, touch her before you say it. 

What I'm saying is I don't think I can do this without it looking like something I'm concentrating on doing. I stand there trying to think of ways to do it whenever I talk to a girl, but it all just doesn't feel right, like I have no business touching her and I'm just looking for excuses to do so."

 In my experience, tons of people got rid if stuff by leaving on the curb, and it was regularly picked up in under an hour by someone who couldn't believe their excellent luck. Putting stuff in the dumpster where you expect *no one* to make any use of it is different, and I would be surprised if the original owner knew that's where they were going.

Are you watching her water intake? If she's peeing excessively, it could be a sign of a medical issue. Make sure she's not peeing so much because she's sick.


Anyway, here's what worked for us: When she goes outside, really praise her immediately after. Make a big production out of it, give her treats and pets, etc. Every time she does her business, give her a treat. Make her bathroom trips as fun as you can. Stay outside with her until you're sure she's done. It could take a while. This might require you to make some time sacrifices. Our dog pees immediately when she goes outside, then waits about 5-10 minutes before pooping, and will sometimes pee again a few minutes after. In the beginning, it took up to an hour before she was done with the whole process.

When she pees inside, if you manage to catch her in the act, just clap loudly or say NO and take her outside, even if she's mid-stream. Don't spank her or rub her nose in pee you find after she's already done it, she won't understand why she's being punished and it could just make things worse.

Keep up the good work though! You're not a bad owner, some dogs just require some extra time. Border collies are an intelligent breed, so hopefully it clicks with her soon. "

Official site: I agree that it isn't a priority but it is something that we will *need* to do if we are to expand beyond the boundaries of Reddit.com

Donations: if there will be contributions made, I can go ahead and set up a Paypal account for the subreddit where donations can be sent. **All donations will be used solely for the subreddit and for the subreddit only. I will not eat your contributions.**

Squad Leaders: this is great to hear. Kilroy and I were, since the inception of the subreddit, playing around and refining the idea of the RSOC platoons being under the management of chosen platoon leaders. 

What do you think of this idea: Each platoon's members choose a Platoon leader. This leader will be given the responsibility of managing everything that happens in that platoon. The current RSOC list would be broken down into several posts, one for each platoon. The platoon leader would be responsible for managing the one for their platoon. We will also, if thought appropriate, talk with these platoon leaders before any significant decisions are made in order to get an idea as to whether the decision is supported by all platoons.

Thoughts?

Commanders: similar to above, I would suggest having member chosen Commanders. This because it means that the Commander would be chosen most likely thanks to his/her Commanding skills.

Events: I'm up for this completely. Lets think of things that we can do. I was thinking things that would be like best engineer, medic, sniper, pilot etc of the month as well as best platoon of the month. For prizes, we will obviously need funds. Until and unless we can get those, I am willing to try and give out special flairs (once I get them working of course :P )

courierblue,AdviceAnimals,1388813287.0,"It's not always like that and even then, that's only part of it.

 The abusers makes them think they can change. They'll slap you one night and bring you flowers or at least flowery apologies the next morning. They start out small with  barely noticeable forms of abuse like emotional or psychological abuse and a push here or there, building it up to physical. No one stays with someone who just starts battering them, but they might stay if they haven't realize how bad it's gotten.

 They make excuses because they're convinced that the good parts that occur at the [end of a cycle of abuse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cycle_of_Abuse.png) are really that person and not the hitting that comes with it. Abusers can also be really good at manipulating emotions so that you believe them every time until usually an outside force makes you realize there's a cycle going own, which is the reason why abusers tend to isolate their victims.

It's a combination of becoming acclimated to abuse, being isolated emotionally, socially or physically and internalizing blame, not just the abused being fucked up in the head."

thevernabean,sysadmin,1388813289.0,"Looks like it sat at the end of a conveyor for too long. You can tell because it has the black marks on the bottom from sliding on the black belts while being crushed between two packages (or the end of a slide.) During the busy season, when you can't keep up with the un-loaders, they would back up and the poor package on the end of the line would be crushed by about 500 packages behind it while being sanded down by the belts. 

See the accordion shape on either end and how it tried to fold over? It looks like someone had to pry it out. I hurt my fingers a lot doing that and the packages liked to pop up at you so you have to get out of the way or you would be pushed against the running conveyors behind you. Then it just crushes the next package in line or drops a ton of packages on your feet and legs. OSHA was always absent during those REALLY busy times.

Gotta love peak season at UPS, but I had a ton of fun working there.

Pro-tip, if you are shipping something delicate or valuable, order just after Dec. 25th. Usually the entire place is dead as an American DHL plant after that point. Otherwise ask your shipper to use a double or triple wall cardboard box and pillow packaging. It will probably cost them a few bucks extra but it will save them on return shipping during busy season."

While I see the merit of this explanation, I don't think I quite agree with the presentation. After all, is Native American art any less beautiful because it never knew about Western rules of composition? Does Eastern music have no inherent beauty because it's based on a different scale than Western music? 

I think rather than art reacting to the Rules, the Rules are instead a guide for the follower to immerse themselves in the aesthetic sensibilities that make the art. Once you have a grasp of those sensibilities, then you can go ahead and ignore the rules. It's a subtle difference, but an important one in I think. We're essentially making the same point, I just don't necessarily agree that communication art is by breaking or following rules, because how were those rules conceived of in the first place?"

solo_sysygy,IAmA,1388814120.0,"Hey, I'm a USMA 2003 guy, and though I lack the resume of COL(R) Mansoor, I have a couple of tips for you:

- First, the main thing is that you refuse to go down without the fight of your life. The academics at West Point are structured so that if you can't overcome it with natural talent, you can make it with hard work. If you fail a class but the Dean sees that you were going in for AI every week, that will help your case enormously. (Instructors are required to keep a record of how many times you come for AI.) If the instructor wasn't very helpful, FIND ANOTHER INSTRUCTOR. Resolve to knock on every door at the Academy until you can find someone who will give you the help you need. 
- Have you mentioned the problem to your TAC? Let him know that you are struggling but willing to do whatever it takes to climb out of that hole. This helps you two ways: first, if you do get considered for separation, your TAC will have a say. The fact that you came to him aggressively seeking ways to fix the problem will be a point in your favor. Second, the TAC will help you find the right person (either an upperclassman or an instructor in the history department) who can tutor you.
- The Center for Enhanced Performance is still up in Washington Hall, right? I took one of their student success courses, and it helped a little bit. They may be able to identify some basic things in your study habits that need to be changed.
- Sometimes problems with history are amplified by poor writing skills. If you don't know how to hastily structure a clear, well thought-out answer to an essay question, you won't do great even if you know the necessary historical facts. But naturally, you have to know the facts as well.
- You're about to start your next semester of classes, including another history class. Talk with your instructor the first day, and let him know your situation. Schedule AI right off the bat. You do realize that if you ask your instructor to meet with you individually once a week he'll do it, right? West Point is almost unparalleled in the amount of individual instruction you can get just by asking for it.


One last thing: If none of this stuff works, let me know and I will be glad to personally make a phone call to some of my classmates who are teaching in the history department and we'll get someone to help you. Seriously. Academics at West Point are hard, but you can totally do it if you're tenacious. Now go forth and beat the Dean."

jongbag,changemyview,1388814449.0,"&gt; Without consideration for what your founders intended, you're left with politicians and their lawyers, nit-picking the language of your founding documents, seeing what they can technically get away with.

But isn't that precisely what is happening already? It seems that the with the current way of doing things, the argument is just shifted from nitpicking language to nitpicking intent.  But attempting to evaluate original intent brings up a number of problems that evaluating language wouldn't:

* It's often difficult to fully know the founder's original intent, particularly within the context that the document was written.  As a result, it is relatively easy to skew a founder's alleged views and use them in support of an argument.  A common example is the assertion that America was founded on Christian values, and therefore anything that brings those values under threat ought not to be allowed.  This defense has been used in support of things like mandatory prayer in schools, not allowing homosexuals to marry, and the marginalizing of other religions and atheism, to name a few.

* Relying on the founder's original intent doesn't leave any room for social evolution.  For example, many of the original writers of the Constitution owned slaves.  We can clearly conclude that at least some of them had no moral or societal objection to slavery. The 'intent' argument could therefore be applied in support of slavery. 

* Similar to above, the intent argument is incapable of accounting for the vastly different landscape in present-day America compared to the America of a few centuries ago.  The 2nd amendment, for example, has drastically different implications than it used to- purely from a technological standpoint. These changes should be taken into account and evaluated.

While the founding father's intent was probably useful in the time in which the Constitution was written, we need to govern ourselves in regards to the needs of the present.  The founding fathers, in their wisdom, realized this, which is why they made the Constitution a living document, that was capable of being altered to fit the changing needs of society.

ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1388814901.0,"I was waiting and waiting for them to reference Skyrim. Skyrim is the perfect example.

There always has been - and always will be - a lot of hype over Morrowind. It was hard, and sometimes unsatisfying, very buggy, and not all that well-balanced. The graphics were mediocre-to-bad even back in the day. But there were so many game design decisions that were so original and just perfect.

I still remember loading Oblivion on my all new computer, being really impressed, but a few hours in feeling kind of sad an wanting to go back to Morrowind. There were lots of changes, good and bad. The most important thing wasn't the graphics or animations or anything - the *worst* change in Oblivion, by far, was *voicing.* Unvoiced Morrowind random citizens would write you books about the world they live in. You learned so much about Morrowind just by talking to people. The speech stats mattered a whole lot because you could get a lot more information by being personable. The world was just so much more full, and one of the most important ways is that the people felt like people, even if they weren't fully voiced.

Skyrim is prettier, better balanced... but it's lost so much. There's so little story now. They can't sell that Alduin is a douchey god like the way they sold Vivec. You can barely build your character because of the lack of real stats. There's barely a civil war, barely a conflict between Old Nord and Imperial culture, for which there is a *huge* amount of lore already. Bethesda sold their souls.

crossing state lines-- i assume they will have cops watching for people doing minor traffic infractions headed toward the state line, then pull them over. because a lot of people know you don't have to consent to a search, many will probably admit guilt and be arrested.

In the experimental film example, someone who doesn't necessarily study film production should still be able to ""get"" experimental movies if they just watch a lot of film and consume art consciously in general.

It felt odd having a Junna-centric episode considering how little she had to do with the plot, while Subaru had much more plot relevance.

This hero stalks these demons after he's done with work at a butchers shop, but our Dark Duchess cares not.

This is exactly what I'd expect an INTJ to say. I used to date an INTJ and we just used to get into arguments a lot because it frustrates me that he thought his way of life was the best way. And then he would try to make me more like him and would't take anything I say seriously. It made me feel like..unwanted and he could be SO harsh. I don't think INTJs see the value in the ""how you say it"" part of communication. Being blunt is good at times, but it can be hard. I'm overly sensitive and INTJs are like the stark opposite of this so we don't understand each other on this level.

It's so fun to talk about new theories and possibilities and something about INTJs draws me to them at first, quietly confident and has thought about a lot of the same things, but as soon as we start talking about anything emotional or about people, we don't understand each other. 

That's my experience with a male INTJ, I realize I'm still young though and I think we could have really gotten along well if we were both a bit more well-developed and well-rounded. I just felt like I was willing to change to accommodate this INTJ and he wasn't willing to do the same for me so that's that. Not sure if that contributes anything to this discussion, but I figured I'd share just in case.

IBiteYou,conservatives,1388818212.0,"Let's see if Reddit eats this response.

I was not a religious person.  I was an atheist/agnostic.

There have been quite a few traumatic and terrible experiences that I have been through.  Not to go into a ton of details.  I'm 43 and both of my parents are dead and died in surprising ways.  I wasn't a Christian when my dad died...but was when my mom did.

And there are other things.  

But everyone has a cross to bear.

There was a time, when I was at my grandmother's house and there was simply a confluence of the worst things you can imagine going on.

I found myself...of an evening... up on the roof.

I was sitting and looking at the stars and I began to pray.  I beseeched God to help.  I didn't even really totally believe God was there...but I had an anxiety.  A loved one was in Iraq.  I felt something was wrong.

On top of all of the everyday drak and the totality of shit that had been my life... I was worried.

I don't know how long I sat there just pleading for God to help.

And then I felt a presence and a light.  A warmth.  A peace that passes understanding.  I knew that things would be ok.  That I didn't have to worry.  I knew that I would be ok.

And God has never failed me.  Even since...when times have been tough.  Something has happened to help.  Under dire circumstances...there has been a Comforter.

BTW - the time I was on the roof... my loved one was in a convoy in Iraq that blew up.  He is ok.  Now he flies drones and searches for enemies laying ied's.

God will always be there for you... but you won't realize it until you acknowledge that HE exists."

But so my break has been fine, I had two papers to write since I got home and now they are finished.

For Christmas Eve, I spent time with family friends and I had to catch up on the beer advent calendar I made, I had one beer a day from december 1st -24th and then exams so I skipped a few days and drank the remaining ones all on the 24th so I got a little drunk and danced and sang to christmas songs with my family, which was fun.

Christmas day I went with my family to visit my grandma in her nursing home in Iowa, which kind of sucked because nursing homes are really depressing and I just felt like being alone but was forced to spend ""family time"". It sort of exasperates me.

And since then, I am now visiting other family in Colorado and we went skiing and had a New Year's party which was fine...New Year's Eve always sucks because I get reflective and depressed and lonely or whatever because I don't have any one to kiss (I know, this is so petty, why does it bother me?!??) and I ended up texting two of my ex boyfriends which just made me feel worse.

Group dates are much more casual than single dates, though, to the point where I don't necessarily assume romantic interest from someone who asks me on a group date. I assume that the guy will at some point ask me on a single date if he's actually interested in dating me.

If we already know each other and we both already have a good idea that we're interested in each other, then a single date is probably better. I wouldn't fault someone for a group date and I'd be happy to go, but I don't think anything terribly romantic is going to happen in that situation."

What an incredibly stupid statement.

Right now, slightly less than 1/6 of the US population is on Medicare - and the program is currently eating up 21% of Federal revenues... [but those numbers are going to increase massively over the next few years even without putting the rest of the population on the program](http://kff.org/medicare/slide/projected-medicare-spending-2013-2023/).

1/3 of US doctors are not taking new Medicare patients, because the reimbursement rates are too low - and if you try to force them, many will just retire.

[Fraud, waste and abuse account for $10% of current Medicare and Medicaid spending.](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/01/02/HHS-Mistaken-Payments-Grow-in-2013-Fueled-By-60-Billion-in-Medicare-and-Medicaid-Overpayments)

Lastly, the supposed ""savings"" would be in costs that aren't being paid by the government in the first place - so they'd be ""savings"" in the same sense as someone who goes and buys a bunch of things that are on sale that they can't afford, and then go on about how much they ""saved"".

I have HPV, no idea who I got it from since HPV(like herpes) is ""primarily transmitted through contact with infected skin or mucosal surfaces."" (http://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/latex.htm)

Found out through an abnormal pap smear, the gynecologist said I need to make sure to stay up-to-date on my paps but besides that it wasn't a big deal.

Regarding the vaccine:
I was fully inoculated as a preteen (as recommended) and still have a strain of the virus- as far as I can tell the vaccine protects against the strains most likely to cause cancer and 100% encourage all people to get the series. If you are a female don't assume you are safe from HPV just because you have received the vaccine.


If you are worried that your health insurance won't cover the vaccination and are under 19 in the United States check out the Vaccines for Children Program. 


TL;DR: 
The HPV vaccine series doesn't cover all strains of HPV.
Females: stay current with paps!
If you are under 19 in the US and can't afford the vaccine series there is help."

By you're logic its okay for a guy to have unprotected sex one time and be tied down for the rest of his life emotionally and financially to a baby. He gets one choice (he has no right to get an abortion). 

At the same time, the mother is entitled to three choices. First having unprotected sex. Second getting an abortion. Third giving it up for adoption. And even if she keeps the kid, she gets financial support.

In the end the girl is looked at as trashy and the boy as some sort of rapist who forced her. Which seems worse to you?

The thing about the reservists:  
Switzerland has conscription for all male citizen, and when you finished your service you are reservist for some other years (I think until you're 35). As a reservist you're legally required to have all your military gear at home, in working condition, part of this military gear is a [Sturmgewehr 90 (or SIG SG 550, as it's called by the manufacturer)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_SG_550) and 25 rounds in a sealed container that you are only allowed to open in case of war.

I actually fully expect people in the better vehicles to set the pace in bad weather, as opposed to obviously handling the vehicle like they've spun out recently and would like to avoid doing so again. 

Again, while I'm not carrying some grudge against luxury brands, I do find that in non-hazardous weather they're often the ones driving through the small gaps in traffic. Again, I understand, the vehicle is better balanced and more responsive. But handling or no, the tires are what decide whether you live or die. The difference in performance between good and bad weather is that much greater.

Not to mention that he downright refuses any assistance or help from anyone else as well as refusing to help anyone else in fear that they might release a better, less-secure solution to 3DS homebrewing."

Because entry-level jobs suck.

Even if that job paid $15/hr, I still would have jumped at the first opportunity to go to college and do something less miserable. Most people don't want to spend their lives in fast food. 

And I must say, I find the next paragraph very mean-spirited and ageist. I don't know why people think it's acceptable to talk about teenagers this way. Teenagers are human beings and don't deserve this treatment. They're also the only group of people expected to just take this sort of attitude from others without speaking up for themselves (and before you ask, I'm not a teenager, I'm almost 25).

There are foreign exchange places at airports but you would probably need to go to a bank otherwise. 

The first time I went I brought travellers cheques and exchanged some in the airport and the rest at my hotels (not all hotels will do this but many do). The next time I went I got a prepaid debit card from a foreign currency place (mine was the Fairfx card but all the big companies do this) and withdrew cash periodically from the convenience store. This was cheaper than using my own bank card due to the fees my bank would levy.

And as I said, that the OP's brother was in fact the OP's newly-out sister was by *far* the interpretation that made the most sense. What did we know, prior to the OP's further comments? 

* This person ""came out"" (came out as what, we don't know) 

* The individual was assigned male at birth; OP refers to them as their brother 

* Sometimes friends and relatives of newly-out trans people, even while trying to be supportive, use the wrong pronouns and terminology - so this doesn't tell us anything regarding the photo's subject's gender identity 

* Following coming out as something, this person's sibling applied makeup to them

* This seemed to make them pretty happy 

* Women wear makeup of the type depicted *vastly* more frequently than men

* Makeup of the type depicted is not in any way associated with gay men

* (Except by homophobic misogynists, who believe that femininity in men and male homosexuality go hand in hand) 

* Makeup of the type depicted would be seen as fairly normal for a woman 

* For a newly-out trans girl, something like this would be an amazing show of support and affirmation of her identity from her sibling 

So you tell me, okay? Makeup has *some* connection with women, but *zero* connection with being gay. And you're calling people ""bigots"" for drawing that connection? FFS.

People do that all the time all according to their own morals. Why did that game sell more, why isn't that studio more successfull, why did that film not win the oscar, why did that tv show I love get cancelled, why is this clearly immoral politician still getting votes. 

Are you genuinely suggesting that it is impossible for people to get successfull based on little merit (like let's say right place/right time) or by appealing to lowest common denominator (games, music, books etc) or even illegally (companies strong arming the market brutally)? Now I don't get the impression that that is the case much in the streaming community, that's why I'm talking about this as an overall concept. 

I'm actually completely in agreement with you that even if things that one person might look down upon are successfull there is usually some reason for it/people getting some sort of enjoyment from it. But that doesn't change that people having some sort of ""this is unfair/this doesn't gel with my morality"" feelings will probably always exist. My whole point is to give those people the advice how to deal with those feelings by pointing out that I personally think there are limits you can blame somebody for (again as long as they are not holding a gun to anybody's head) when what really is the deciding factor is the presumed bad taste of a large number of people. This ""bad taste"" is usually something that crops up when a person's morals clash with reality. Things like believing people should have a longer memory and not rush to buy EA products when they acted scummy in the past, or believing people should care about child labor or animal abuse over buying cheap products, or that people should care if a politician says racist or hateful things rather than just hearing that he's promising them jobs or believing that awards should reward innovation or believing that art should be deep and meaningful, that it's immoral to draw in people's clicks with shock value rather than genuine content etc etc. "

To me, that's hypocritical.

2. Alexander Rusev - though he has to ditch the blonde, he could fill the same role, more believably than shitty Mason Ryan, is more believable, but at the same time, is a clear heel and the ideal tool for turning Rollins or Ambrose face when the time comes.

3. Ryback - partner Reigns with his cousins in the Uso's, and make a series of fantastic six man tags, leading to a horrible Ryback-Reigns match where Reigns nonetheless goes over and is established as a singles powerhouse."

The reality is, no matter what terminology is used, in a V situation 95% of the time, one partner is secondary to another.  This isn't always the newer partner - sometimes the newer partner ends up replacing the established partner in the affections of the hinge of the V - but regardless, as you're finding out, hierarchies exist and it's strange to me that people don't acknowledge that for the sake of polyamory political correctness.

If you want to stay with him, you probably will have to be compliant towards HIS choices (he's making these choices too - don't let him off the hook and blame it all on your  metamour!) to a great degree.  Only you can figure out if you're OK with that or not.

We are both highly sexual people who don't necessarily connect emotions for sex, so having casual sex partners or FWBs once in a while works for us because we feel very secure in our relationship knowing we put the other person first in every way.

A lot of people who are open don't share that info with family and friends, because it's ""just sex"" and don't feel the need to involve family and friends in their sex lives.  A few good friends of ours know about our status, but most of our casual friends don't.

boomerangotan,changemyview,1388831547.0,"&gt; I get that religion can help people cope and all, but it only helps people cope if they are already religious.

I'm not sure this is a valid assumption.  

I am not religious, but when my father died, I found myself in a bit of an existential sinkhole.  I ultimately found a lot of useful ""advice"" from Buddhism, Hinduism and other Eastern religions.  I simply set aside the mystical parts and still found quite a bit of practical wisdom.

I learned a lot about impermanence, attachment, and suffering which helped me deal with my father's death and even helped to relieve fear of my own eventual death.  I also find that these concepts can be very useful tools for helping me choose a path when I find myself at a decision-making crossroad.

Learning about the various interpretations of enlightenment opened my eyes to new ways to interpret and perceive reality.  While I wouldn't say that I hold a belief in these concepts, I have over time adjusted myself to be more mindful of these possibilities, and I am fairly confident these adjustments have resulted in a significant positive improvement on my state of mind and also in how I treat and think of other people.

I would say the result is that I was able to use religion to help me cope with a death and improve myself without being or becoming religious."

If you weren't so high when you wrote your astoundingly moronic, and incredibly poorly thought out comment, you probably wouldn't have been so quick to assume I'm against legal weed, or was even directly referring to driving intoxicated. Because I'm most certainly not, and I most definitely wasn't. I was making a statement of what is likely to come. Nothing more. I took no clear side in that comment, and so your ignorant response was quite transparent. You're pathetically looking for a ""fight"" you can win about marijuana. You're pretty much the worst kind of person, and most definitely not the kind of person the legalization movement needs. You honestly come across as a child though, so I imagine your opinion wont mean anything legally for a few more years. So that's good.

&gt;The amount of drunk driving deaths tells me youre just as ignorant as every state aside from colorado.
 
None of that was an appropriate response to my comment. Not even a little. You shouldn't *blindly* jump at the chance to defend legalization. Read the comments you plan to reply to instead of quickly skimming them and mixing personal attacks into your responses that are loosely based on the comment you're replying to at best. 

The fact that someone upvoted your mess of a comment is incredibly sad. That someone not only understood exactly what you were talking about AND thought the response was actually an appropriate one is mind blowing and a testament to just how sad Reddit is becoming. 

You absolutely *have* to work on your sentence structure, refrain from referring to people as states, and avoid insulting people that have done nothing at all to deserve it. 

People do crash while under the influence of marijuana. People die in crashes. Those are facts. One substance causing fewer crashes than another substance causes is *not* a good reason for legalization. Stop being such an obvious parrot. Think instead of simply repeating what others have said just because you thought it sounded good when they said it. Or are you [too a'stupid to make up your own mind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oaVN0PXwHo)? Probably, considering your comment. 

Do America a huge favor, don't ever ""defend"" legalization again. The only thing you do is hurt the image. The last thing we need is a bunch of 9th grade drop outs that were too cool for skool and thought everything was too easy but never got a decent grade in their lives attempting to defend it with their poor English skills.

MisterScalawag,fastfood,1388832389.0,"Yes its called inflation, when there is more money available and even the lowest jobs in the country make around 20 bucks an hour you can charge more for goods.


The US federal minimum wage is 7.25. How much is a gallon of milk (well shit you probably won't use gallons) or 3.78 Liters of milk cost? Or a loaf of bread from the store? Normally a gallon of milk costs 1-2 dollars where I live, but at certain places you can get it for 99 cents. And a loaf of bread costs 2 dollars or less.


A better way for you to see the difference is to google US vs Australia goods prices. Sure you minimum wage is just over twice ours, so the goods should be around twice as much. But the problem is when you look at the numbers a lot of times goods will much more than double the price. This is worse than inflation, because with inflation you would expect the goods to be priced proportionally to how much the lowest earners make. Effectively lowering the buying power of the Australian dollar. Meaning in america I could buy more goods at 7.25/hr than you could in australia at your minimum wage per hour.

So you get free replacements and sharpening forever- as in if you use it for like 40 years and hand it down; whoever you give it to gets free sharpening and replacements forever just because you got one off them (you have to pay for shipping if you don't have someone come to you to sharpen it but otherwise it's free) and if you misuse or abuse it you get a replacement for 50% off

Also there's a 15 day trial period after you get it where you can return it and get a refund no questions asked in case you don't find it suits you or you want a different one instead or something

-Great midway point to visit QLD and Melbourne on your holidays. Surfers Paradise has a lot of outdoor, ocean things to do. Melbourne has a really nice indie culture going on

Least faves:

-While wages are higher than the rest of the world, living costs are also really high

-Rent prices is ridiculous owing to the bubble. I get a spacious 1-br apartment 10+ stories up in Dubai but can only get a crappy, shared apartment in Inner West Sydney for the same price. Utilities are also really expensive.

-Nightlife is bad considering its destination status and compared to Melbourne. There's only really clubbing and pubs/bars to visit unless an event is going on.

-Public transport is kind of embarrassing, especially the trains

-Aussies aren't very professional, could be good for some, could be bad for others like me work-wise

-Shops usually close too early on a weekday

-Delivery shopping isn't too developed yet. We don't have something as efficient as Amazon yet

-Netflix and that aren't available here. We don't have too much troubles with that but noticed some people from North America aren't too happy with it

the third is self defense. sure against a mugger that 50BMG isnt exactly practical, ill admit. but what about larger targets, ie the gov. i know everyone likes to jump up and down about how saying this makes me a tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist but im serious. as military technology advances the only way the modern musket idea can be upheld is by allowing civilian technlogy to keep up. and as for the possibility of it happening i would like to point out that one of Californias elected officials has supported laws and ideals infringing on half the bill of rights. our dear Sen.

messiahwannabe,HistoryPorn,1388836592.0,"ok, so these are all perfectly sound arguments.  and yes, you're right!  i'm totally assuming things.  and if i'm going to do something more important than choose between vanilla and strawberry, i certainly need much more than that!

but i'm not doing something more important than choosing between vanilla and strawberry.    they probably weren't going give me an airline to run before, and they certainly aren't going to now.  **ON TOPIC PART--&gt; all i'm doing is discussing a picture of happy laughing stewardesses from the 70's with a bunch of strangers on a forum on the internet.  it's a forum about history, and days of yore.  there was a comment regarding, what was it, us going back to the days of sexual discrimination?  and it reminded me of a pet theory of mine regarding asian flight attendants vs. americans.  &lt;-- ON TOPIC PART**  which i then typed out loud.   i didn't intend to spend the whole day defending my completely off the cuff remarks from a bunch of complete strangers calling me names and swearing at me, though i guess i sorta saw it coming.  if i'd thought it through, maybe i might have prepared some sort of cases to site, evidence to back me up.  i just did that a minute ago, and quickly found like 6-7 magazine articles, the very first 6-7 i found, more or less saying what i said.  of course, none of them were from scientific journals or studies or anything, but even if they were, i don't think it would have made much difference really anyway.

look, is it a flawed argument?  well, it's not a rigorous argument backed up by citations of articles published in scientific journals, double blind experiments, or employee handbooks and corporate guidelines regarding hr practices.  no, i can't *prove* why asian flight attendants are happier, or even *if* they're happier.  it's just messiah frikkin wannabe here, talking out of his ass as usual.  at the same time, it's not it's all just pulled out of the air cause i like being a sexist troll.  it's kind of an occams razor slicing a couple things i've noticed after logging a zillion hours in the air myself.  that's it.  i spelled it all out in bullet points of logic and stuff just now, but it started to get all tl;dr-y so i cut it.  besides, really you don't have to agree with me anyway, i'm just talking here.  i have a pet theory, i espoused it.  which leads to this:

&gt; The main thing is that you're using this terrible argument to promote the restriction of personal freedoms that our culture has fought long and hard to have recognized at all. That's what I personally so strongly object to. 

and, i think this is another deal where, again, we may just have to agree to disagree.  i seriously, not sarcastically but honestly and truly, respect your right to feel this way.  it's an admirable belief.  certainly i have a lot of sympathy for the feminist viewpoint, and respect their need to fight the good fight.  but, *my* main thing is more a freedom of speech deal.  an open marketplace of ideas.  discourse, discussion, debate.  and, one of my big ones here, something i like to discuss and debate, is gender politics.  i really think there needs to be more openness about this subject.  It Is A Complicated Subject, and we have not found all the answers to all of the intricate problems presented by the issues contained within this subject just yet.

but, any time any discussion occurs around this, things get so out of hand.  it's like on one hand there's the  /r/shitredditsays kind of camp, and on the other hand you have the ""BITCH MAKE ME SANDWICH, ALSO NO ABORTIONS"" crowd...  and there's nothing in between.  there is nothing *allowed* in between.  did you see the venom directed at me?  no one ever calls me names on the internet, i'm just not that trollish.  unless!  i breath a *word* about gender relations that isn't scrupulously and firmly within the short list of platitudes you are allowed to speak on the subject.  even my red state  ""BMMS,ANA!"" type relatives on the republican side of the family are more considered and open minded to different points of view on this topic than the /r/shitredditsays crowd.

**ON TOPIC PART --&gt;  and i just think the whole stewardess/flight attendant thing ties in as a random illustration of how weird and complex these things can be.  ""here's my theory!""  &lt;-- ON TOPIC PART**

so.  i said it.  i don't defend it as rigorously researched.  you don't by any means have to agree with me, but i'm certainly not here to promote the restriction of anyone's personal freedoms.  i'm here to talk freely on topics that interest me, and one topic that interests me is finding a more nuanced, and less polarized, reading of gender roles.  that's something i personally feel kinda strongly about myself, if only because no one else seems to be willing to even consider the issue, or talk about it.  unfortunately, it's a volatile subject that seems to bring out the worst in some people.  

not you though!  thanks for taking the time to respond.

TL;DR: you're right, it's not a sound argument, it's strangers yakking with each other on the internet.  you feel i'm promoting the restriction of people personal freedoms, yet i feel that being jumped on for speaking freely is another restriction of something equally important - the right to free discussion of stuff.  in particular gender politics.  which is a very verboten topic to openly discuss, but i feel it needs to not be.  because it is a complicated, important subject.  

**A SUBJECT WHICH IS WELL ILLUSTRATED BY THE TOPIC OF STEWARDESSES** but i admit i'm finding it harder and harder to stay on topic here.  so, this is it for me.  if you want the last word, it's yours."

&gt; Have you ever thought your partner was not as beautiful/sexy because of an unflattering sex position?

... no. And I can't imagine ever thinking that.

Turn the tables for a moment. Can you imagine *ever* thinking that your SO isn't as sexy or attractive anymore, because of what he looked like at one particular moment, in one position during sex?

I hope not.

And honestly, if you're in a long term relationship, then he knows perfectly well what your body looks like. An ""unflattering angle"" isn't going to come as a shock to him, it isn't going to make him suddenly realize that you look like a troll. He sees you, no matter the angle. There's no such thing as ""unflattering"". If he thinks you're beautiful, then he'll keep thinking you're beautiful no matter your pose or the angle he sees you from.

You can worry about something looking unflattering when that is *all* someone sees of you (say, if you send someone a picture of yourself, and that is all they've ever seen of you, or if you're on the cover of a magazine, or whatever). Then that ""unflattering"" image will be how they perceive you. But when you know someone and you know what they look like, you don't really notice individual ""bad"" angles or poses any more. They just see that person."

There are tons of benefits.

It doesn't have to be an _exclusive_ to the steam box, just an additional thing for those who purchase it.

&gt;-Assuming it's exclusive to their steambox, they would have a massive task making/shipping/marketing hardware for a company where that's not their area of expertise (also assuming that Valve's hardware efforts aren't just to make a reference version similar to how AMD/nvidia sell none or extremely few of their own cards, that's OEMs like ASUS, Gigabyte, etc)

I even began to suspect that most of my victories were the result of other people having televisions with high input-lag.

this is because everything is information, so it's not really that extreme.

and if you didn't know that it's all information, then, I hope you're as blown away by this revelation as I was.

and nobody is saying that knowledge is derived *solely* from experience. (I'm not, at least) again, what is it with academic-philosophers and being unable to comprehend conjunctions?

do you know what the word ""or"" means? because it is becoming more and more obvious that you might not know what ""or"" means.

also, our idea of perfection (like our ideas of omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence) absolutely stems from an abstraction of our experience, and here's why!

perfect = without flaws.

we exist in a world where things have positives and negative aspects, nothing is perfect in our world. but we can formulate the sentence ""that which has no flaws"" which gets us to think about some thing that doesn't have the sort of thing everything else has. unfortunately, we have no idea what this would be or look like, so the idea is kind of useless.

omnipotent = able to perform all tasks.

I'm a man monkey, and I can do *some* things. but wouldn't it be cool if I could do *everything*!? Like, fly like a bird, bring the dead back to life, or travel back in time? Because I can do some tasks, and can imagine myself being able to do every task. But then, the same problems applies, and would I be able to make a rock so large I couldn't lift it?

omniscience = to know all things (that can be known, as a clause sometimes)

I know some things, but wouldn't it be cool if I knew *everything*!? Like, whether or not Margaret wants to have sex with me or if my grandma is leaving me out of her will?

omnipresence = to be in all places

I can be in one place, but wouldn't it be cool if I could be in two places at once? fuck it, wouldn't it be cool if I could be *everywhere* at once? I'd be super good at fighting!


seriously, these sorts of ideas emerge from playground bickering in kindergarten all the time.

case in point:

""No, I triple dog dare *you*!""

""Yeah, well I infinitely dog dare *you*!""

in our ridiculously childish efforts to win a childish pissing contest, we come up with ideas such as the aforementioned."

FTFYcent,IWantToLearn,1388841869.0,"&gt;I think most of it is due to stress, especially during timed tests, I freak out and screw it up.

One thing I do is I skip problems I'm having trouble with. Instead of spending valuable time spinning my wheels on a question I'm not sure I can answer, I go through the entire rest of the test and answer what I can before coming back. That way, if I do come back, I'll feel less rushed since I don't have to worry about finishing the rest of the test after answering this question. It's a good way to allocate time appropriately without having to waste valuable minutes just looking over the test before starting, as some other posters suggest. If I can see how much each question is worth (sometimes it isn't obvious) I'll also make a point to spend proportionately less time on lower point questions. Then if I have time to spare at the end, I come back and double check the questions I breezed through quickly.

On a multiple choice test with a lot of questions, there's usually a scantron sheet or something to report your answers; in that case, I'll put a little mark next to the questions I skipped/guessed on so I'll know which ones I need to get back to at the end.

Basically, taking a test linearly is rarely the most optimal approach. What are the odds that the professor/teacher wrote them in exactly the order that works best for you? This is less true for for instance on the SATs where the questions are explicitly ranked in order of difficulty; those are probably the best test for this technique, since you already know in advance which questions deserve extra consideration.

TL;DR: Time management is a bitch. Be smart about it; skip the questions you don't immediately know how to answer and come back to them. Your time is valuable, you don't have time to hem and haw when you have other shit you can be doing."

from this, no actions can be taken, because there is no time for which they can occur.

also there isn't a system of particles and forces from which a structure arises that can categorize, process and retrieve information, so I think the whole idea of any entity, God or otherwise, existing in this hypothetical (probably impossible) ""time/point"" of yours is simply nonsense.

this is probably when you tell me that God is not physical, so doesn't need the system of particles and forces to form structure. But then my question is simply: how does God categorize, process or retrieve information? How does he have memories? How does he *know* things?

there are no answers to any of those questions, because the people who wrote the Bible didn't know jack shit about cosmology or information theory.

CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to watch over and advocate for abused and neglected children, to make sure they don’t get lost in the overburdened legal and social service system or languish in inappropriate group or foster homes. Volunteers stay with each case until it is closed and the child is placed in a safe, permanent home. For many abused children, their CASA volunteer will be the one constant adult presence in their lives. I worked regularly with CASA volunteers, and they did an amazing job of helping me advocate for my clients and their role in my clients' lives helped provide a stability that older foster kids don't always have."

Gnill,edmproduction,1388844499.0,"Read the noob faq :)
Theres no such thing as an EDM-only vst, vst/au synth plugs are synths and you can choose what you want to create with them. Though there are samplers with mostly electronic dance-soudning sounds, like ReFx Nexus, so I guess you kinda could say thats' an ""edm"" vst, though it has lots of other sounds as well. EDM is a word that's hard to define anyway. I wouldn't recommend that (NEXUS) though as you can't make your own sounds and that can feel very limiting, you won't be able to create anything unique/new. At least that feels horribly limiting to me.
Instead, start by getting a subtractive synth vst like NI Massive or LennarDigital Sylenth1. When you've gotten familiar with those you can start exploring additive synths like NI Razor, and FM synths like sytrus or fm8. Those can, for some, be hard to understand if you haven't grasped the basic concept of subtractive synths!

So get e.g Sylenth1 or Massive, learn it really well and you'll be able to create your own unique sounds. Read the manual and watch lots of tutorials! 

What DAW do you use? Reason, Logic and FL studio have great synths, and I'm not sure but I think ableton's synths are ok as well.
No need to buy synths if you have good ones already!"

dirtyewok,coys,1388844518.0,"&gt; he might of been on SAF level

This is honestly a very bad expectation to put on any manager, but especially on a manger who had been with a club for 1 1/2 seasons.

In modern football SAF and Wenger are complete statistical outliers not only in their longevity but their success. It takes an amazing level of talent as well as a shit load of luck to have that type of situation. The manager needs to not only be talented but there is very much a ""right place, right time"" factor that goes into that level of success. 

There is just far too many variables at play that can effect a managerial position to predict that someone can rival the greatest manager in PL history.  Its an unfair expectation for the team and the manager.

If AVB had been with us for 8 seasons at a high level of success, then the conversation of ""what might of been"" is somewhat reasonable (Even that is a stretch). But after a season and half to say someone could have been on the level of SAF is ridiculous, a season and half is just too short and in today's footballing world is really just a normal tenure for a manager.

Why would it be unethical to watch pornography (of consenting adults)?

Also your statement of ""**most** who view it are hypocritical"" is not very precise. As you mentioned yourself there are people who are okay with it.  
There is a wide variety of porn, but to make a rather clean division I'd say there is ""commercial"" porn and ""non-commercial"" (or ""amateur"") porn.  
I'm all for people acting out their sexuality in appropriate places, and if my SO would want to participate in something like /r/gonewild I would help making and editing the photos, because I think it's a lot of fun.  
If my SO would do this for money I'd feel betrayed, because I think that integral parts of sexuality, like intimacy or sensuality, aren't tradeable goods.

wdn,AskHistorians,1388848028.0,"&gt; Well, it's not an arbitrary period of time. It's based on an astronomical cycle just as much as a day or a year or a month are.

Actually a month is pretty arbitrary. A day and a year are both things that exist in nature. Even if we didn't have words for them, you could describe it to someone, ""You know that thing that happens where..."" and they'd know what you're talking about.

While the logic of defining the month is related to such phenomenon (e.g. the 28-day lunar cycle and trying to divide a year into a whole number of them), there are any number of other ways it could have turned out. The month is not something you could point to without the human history that led to the defining of the term.

Fortnight and week are less arbitrary -- a half and a quarter of the lunar cycle (the lunar cycle being the thing you can point to in nature). These are the most likely fractions one would use but it could have turned out differently.

Ultimately, I think what makes ""fortnight"" seem more arbitrary to OP than ""month"" is the mere fact that it is used less often.

Lavernius Titus Regalis was born in Skingrad to an Imperial family about 210 years before Skyrim takes place, became the 8th Champion of Cyrodiil after the great Hero of Kvatch, got turned into a vampire, and got locked up for about 170 years by some jealous lesser vampires. When he woke up, someone had stolen his armor, and he got tired of being a vampire so he tried to cross the border into Skyrim to find someone who was rumored to be able to cure people. People thought he was very, very dead, however, so nobody knew who he was anymore. He fell into a legion ambush on his way.

Unlike most people of Tamriel, he seems to have developed an accent comparable to what people of Earth would consider to be Scottish. He also wanted to recreate Tiber Septim's great actions, and slowly planned a new conquest of Tamriel that he would eventually put into action. Before any of this, though, he vowed to hand-craft a new set of Dragon equipment, forged in the style of a great Paladin."

I say 'some' because ""who are you and what do you do"" is an unreasonable amount of effort to ask from some my players.

I start the session in [medias res](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes). It quickly establishes a issue for the players to resolve together (being attacked by the same giant monster has a way of inspiring cooperation), and gives you the opportunity to get them to develop their prior relationships (if they have any; if they didn't plan any, now is the time to get them to make some up).

Beyond that, I give the players a selection of goals, all of which are equally important, but which are mutually exclusive (ie save X or save Y; can't do both.) and serve a larger goal (whatever the ostensible goal of the campaign is).

We made 2 drifts and caught 2 citation fish. This was my way of giving back to the man that taught me how to fish. Definitely my proudest moment fishing with him and the last fish he ever caught.

Look up LS1 conversions and see if anyone has done them in 350Z, i'm sure it has been done because LS1 conversions are so popular. Then see what is required in doing it. As far as fabrication. The thing about doing it is you're going to need the engine, harness, computer, and transmission all together to do it correctly. Depending on what transmission you put back in it (manual or automatic) is going to present it's own set of hurdles. I'm sure there will need to be a custom cross member made for the transmission. As well as a custom length drive shaft because the transmission is probably going to be longer than the stock transmission that was there.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16894360

&gt; A 59-year-old man undergoing weight loss with very low calorie diets (VLCD) attempted to drive a car, which was fitted with an alcohol ignition interlock device, but the vehicle failed to start. Because the man was a teetotaller, he was surprised and upset by this result. **VLCD treatment leads to ketonemia with high concentrations of acetone, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood**. The interlock device determines alcohol (ethanol) in breath by electrochemical oxidation, but acetone does not undergo oxidation with this detector. However, **under certain circumstances acetone is reduced in the body to isopropanol by hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase** (ADH). The ignition interlock device responds to other alcohols (e.g. methanol, n-propanol and isopropanol), which therefore explains the false-positive result. This **'side effect' of ketogenic diets needs further discussion by authorities** when people engaged in safety-sensitive work (e.g. bus drivers and airline pilots) submit to random breath-alcohol tests."

In these kibbutzim children that were born in the course of one year were raised and educated together from an early age. While it is correct that almost none of the co-raised persons intermarried during the study it is simply wrong to assume that they don't consider each other attractive. Additional studies that actually questioned about attractivity even found *that* they consider each other attractive, they just don't intermarry for external reasons. Mostly because it was the cultural norm there for young women to marry men that were a few years older.

Or to use a crude and lewt analogy: Just because I didn't marry one of the girls from my kindergarten class this doesn't mean that I didn't want to fuck some of them when we were 16."
Viend,korea,1388851266.0,"For the most part generic salsa is really mild. Salsa in Mexican joints tend to be hotter than commercially produced ones, and they're the only places where I can find salsa that's actually more spicy than it is sour. In many places you get to choose between different kinds of salsa and usually there's one ""hot"" option that's actually kinda spicy and the others are almost always mild, eaten more for flavor than for the heat.

While on the topic of spicy foods, as an Indonesian man I found out after moving here that the white man's idea of a ""hot"" sauce is adding too much vinegar and then with a side of pure heat, without any sort of nice flavor at all."
SentientBagOfWater,AskMen,1388851315.0,"You've clearly had a rough time of it.  I haven't been in your shoes, something I should remember more often and be thankful for.

At the end of the day professional help needs to be the first bit of advice you get.  I know you've said it's not something you can access at the moment, but really do make sure you've searched every corner for an affordable/free option before you give up, and if your circumstances do change in the future then continue to seek out that help.  This goes double if you're self-diagnosed - there may be more/other things going on that a professional can help you to understand as well.

That being said the next three important things are a support network, diet and exercise.

Any support network is better than nothing.  Others have suggested relevant subreddits to look into, which is great because they are easily accessible.  Having someone face to face is probably better if you can make it happen - do have a look for local support groups, community groups, social meetups.

There is, as the professionals say, a ""growing body of evidence"" linking diet, exercise and mental health.  Again, this isn't a substitute for other treatments recommended by a doctor, but it is something you can start working on now.  There will always be people trying to sell you on extreme regimes, but by and large these very specific schemes haven't been shown to have more benefit than a balanced diet and plain old light exercise.  You may be able to combine this with the above by looking for local casual sporting teams to join.

Finally, your expectations.  I've heard it said that when you're sick it usually takes about the same time to ""get better"" as it did to become unwell.  You've not said how long ago this abuse occurred but it's clear that this is something which has developed for you over many years.  Even with the best circumstances it is likely to take time, work and patience with yourself before things improve.  Remember this when you get discouraged.  Accept that sometimes things will seem worse than they did yesterday.  I do hope that, over time, the good days will start to outweigh the bad."

paraphrasing that. the ""or mostly"" part is the big hole.

I did a cartilage piercing in the upper ear (pinna) in 1983 with a needle and some vodka in my dorm room.  No problems with that either.

Personally, I think the aftercare is the most important thing.  Keep it clean, put bacitracin on the piercings if they look even a little red or get sensitive at all.  No matter where you get it done, you are still going to take that piercing into the big dirty world.

Stop caring about what other people think, and do what you want to do.  That's advice that will contribute to your happiness in all areas of life.

* 1300 E would be more than enough not including your flight. 

* If I were you I'd seriously consider adding in Vietnam (particularly Ha Long Bay). Both are kind of small and 3 weeks seems like a long time in either place. I think 2 weeks is sufficient then you could add two weeks in Vietnam.

* Obviously, hit Angkor Wat in Cambodia. I'd buy a good book while you're there about the temples and carry it around with you. It made me appreciate it a lot more. Take advantage of the fact that you're allowed to touch and climb on the temples.

* My friends and I stayed very cheaply on the beautiful island of Koh Rong. A small Cambodia island as good as any Thai island but without the crowds. One small village and miles and miles of empty white beach with blue water. We stayed here: http://monkeyisland-kohrong.com/ It was very cheap, excellent food and cheap beer. Clean and great service. Lot's of Europeans and Aussies. I'd highly recommend it as a ""vacation"" from your ""vacation"". They have snorkeling and hiking stuff.

* My friend went to an elephant sanctuary somewhere in NE cambodia. She loved it and got to work with elephants. I can try to find the info from her if you're interested.

* In general, you don't necessarily need to decide on your journey now. Perhaps just start in Bangkok and do cambodia and then Laos and see what the timing is like. You can always get a visa to go to vietnam if you have more time. Perhaps most importantly, you're going to meet lots of backpackers along the way who have been to the places you want to go. So you can get really really valuable tips from them.

Let me know if you have any other questions! It's a beautiful part of the world!

HawkeyeGK,Database,1388851984.0,"It is certainly something that could be built using Access.  Whether or not you can do it in a reasonable amount of time and well enough that you won't build yourself into a corner is something that's impossible to tell without any of your background.

There are lots of missing requirements from your list that will matter when you build out your solution.  For example, how many teachers and how many students are we dealing with?  How many people need to be able to edit teachers and students at any one time?  What are the rules for matching students to teachers?  How will you handle it when someone forgets their password?  You get the idea.

If you're interested in learning how to design a database, form entry, etc, then it sounds like a good first project.  If you're planning on running a business on it, then I'd consider investing some money in making sure that you have something that will work and scale to your needs.  

I can't tell you how many times I've seen a home-grown access database that has business processes dependent on it where everything started out just find but then it ran into a scaling issue or data inconsistency issue and the business process came to a screeching halt.  This is why IT guys hate Access.  

If this is a really important tool for your business, then you'll probably either need to invest in some help up front or later when you run into problems down the road.  It's cheaper to do it up front.

All that being said, you'll probably well-served to look for a vended solution that meets your needs.  I don't know of any off the top of my head, but I'd look for something configurable as there most likely won't be anything that exactly meets your needs.  I'm thinking something like SalesForce.com and starting from there.  Also, I don't see any reason why you couldn't get this done using SharePoint if you happen to have that up and running and feel like you can get creative a bit.

I think most zoos are doing great work. But of course, some are out for profit, don't care about their animals or their rehabilitation, and are scuzzbags. 

Because of the popularity of Blackfish, a lot of people are turning against captive-animal organizations- which kind of sucks. I think asking questions and holding people accountable is important, but don't lump everyone into one group just because one organization has been exposed. Remember that a lot of zoos do amazing humanitarian work, rehabilitate their animals and release them back to the wild, and provide education and awareness for the next generation about the importance of conservation and protection.

matt_512,changemyview,1388854001.0,"I'll use the US constitution since I'm more familiar with it.

The constitution's wording is quite vague in many places. If the founding fathers had written a twelve thousand page mammoth constitution, then we wouldn't need to worry about finding out the intent--it would have been right in front of our eyes. But since it's so vague, we can't know what the words actually mean without looking back at what they would have meant in that time to those writers.

Why not a ""living tree?"" Constitutions, especially when they start getting old, have to be applied to new situations. I'm not against viewing the constitution as a living document at all! There is no contradiction between looking at what the founding fathers intended and applying it to modern situations in a modern way where that ability was given. (Hint: you can do that in many parts of the constitution.) 

The problem with looking at it with no context at all is that words change meaning, passages are written poorly, etc., and none of it makes sense without that context. What if, long in the future, people stop using ""bear arms"" in relation to weapons? If they didn't look at the original intent, then everyone would have the right to the arms of a bear. 

The problem with ignoring the constitution because ""people don't think like that today"" or ""it's a different world"" when it explicitly says something is this: at that point you may as well say ""do whatever."""

On this note (and based on my own experience) I'd like to give a general tip to women for when a guy is doing something slightly wrong.

Don't just signal ""Yes, that's great"" or ""Nah, not doing it for me"", use body language and words to show him what he should be doing instead, that way he won't have to try a bunch of different things until he finds something that works (and you won't get frustrated that he doesn't just get it right already).

The communication between you (using both verbal and nonverbal communication) shouldn't be:

* ""What about this?""
* ""Nope""
* ""This then?""
* ""Nah""
* ""This?""
* ""Still nope""
* ""Alright, this?""
* ""Naah, don't think so""
* ""Fine, this?""
* ""Still nothing""
* ""What if I do this as well?""
* ""Oh yeah""

Try:

* ""What about this?""
* ""Try more like [...]""
* ""Like so?""
* ""Oh yeah""

And yes, I've experienced both scenarios a few times, the first one is incredibly frustrating for both involved parties.

**tl;dr:** If a guy is doing something wrong, don't just tell him he's doing it wrong, tell him what he's doing wrong and how to do it better."

Artists are artists. They are not here to instruct the masses. They are here to make art. If they so wish, they can use that art to talk politics, but that is not a quality inherent to an artist. They don't owe us anything any more than anyone else does.

Both of these issues will go away as you play more games.

I thought this would be the case, but I haven't found much variance in kimchi unless they were specifically labeled with another name eg. onion kimchi.

whengarble,casualiama,1388855305.0,"I went to a Methodist camp as a kid but, as much as they stressed god, it might as well been nondenominational. It was a local day camp so there was hiking in the woods but no mountains unfortunately. 

Every morning started with a talk at 0800 that lasted all of fifteen minutes. It talked about daily events, plans, and ended with one prayer. We would do activities in the morning such as canoeing, hiking, soccer, archery, and any other outdoor activity you could think of. 

During the lunch hour we would have one prayer before meals and then have time to eat for thirty minutes. The next thirty minutes was, in hindsight, devotional time. We would go somewhere at the camp with our group and counselor and talk about things. Usually the theme was to just be kind to others. I'd say only 1/10 of them even mentioned religious things directly.

After that it was swimming for two hours in the lake. Specific areas were made available for water gun fights, cannon balls, and water polo. It lasted for about two hours and I remember boys just wore shorts, possibly a shirt, and girls wore a one piece. I only just remembered the dress code at the camp. Many people wore long pants, due to all the hiking in the woods, but shorts were not uncommon. As long as they weren't short shorts nothing was said. 

Then at 1500 we went back to the big pavilion, like we did in the morning, and talked followed by some fun songs and then a prayer. We did it at that time because there were two times to leave the camp, 1530 or 1700. So after the big meeting was usually the large group games such as soccer.

There was virtually no bullying as it was severely punished. That little crap about the song would be considered bullying. The youth leaders were awesome but then they were from the same local community the kids were from so if they did anything it was likely to reach the ears of their mother and woe be unto them. Of course we had field trips where we would go do certain things like see Museums or a play. There was one play that was five short plays all based on Edgar Allen Poe's works. That violence and Gothic themes were loved by my ten year old self.

TL;DR Methodist camp was super chill.

- Botched UI (but you can fix it)
- Still some rough edges (drivers/sleep not working/some stuttering)
- Metro apps make no sense on large, touchless screens.

Windows 8.1 pros :

- Ribbon interface for Windows Explorer (Takes some time to adjust, but afterwards it's a definitive improvement)
- Faster boot time (but who boots anymore?)
- File History (such a better automated backup than the Windows 7 equivalent)
- No gimping of the basic version to make the Pro version more attractive.

In terms of gaming, what I got with FRAPS was identical. HardOCP seems to agree with what I got.(http://www.hardocp.com/article/2013/11/24/battlefield_4_windows_7_vs_81_performance_review/1)

In terms of daily usage, I've installed both on older laptops and they perform exactly the same, except for the boot times.

Honestly, grab either and you will be fine. I wouldn't go back to W7 just because I love File History, but they are almost the same once you tweak them to your taste.

There's a lot to unpack here, really.  Let's assume he does find you attractive, is pretty much over the body hair thing, etc.  He may not go down on you very often because a) let's face it, that shit is TIRING (have you gone down on a woman before?) and b) he may feel insecure about how good he is at it.  Is it really the ONLY way you can get off with him?  Sex toys don't work?  His hands don't work?  If my husband could ONLY get off via blowjob, he would not be orgasming every single time we had sex, either.  He should definitely step it up to do something that you really, really enjoy and get off on, but I think it's a little much to expect oral sex to completion every single time you have sex.

I'm more concerned by the fact that he doesn't seem interested in learning what you like and how to get you off, though.  He sounds, well, lazy in bed.  That's not uncommon with dudes of his age.

This might be solvable, but at what cost?  You've been together a year - this is often where serious, ongoing relationship issues start to rear their head and there's a chance that some of them might just become a pattern instead of begin solved.  Is he worth working on extensively with this?  Do you have an indication that he's even willing to work at it, period (beyond promises that go unfulfilled?)

IDK, given your age and the problems, I think a split might be the right move here.  And as you know, there are plenty of guys who don't require a shaved pussy or legs.  The best ones, in my opinion."

In reality, you have a distribution of people. Some can't shoot. Some can't run. Some can't stop hitting the whiskey and get in fights out in town. You end up having to make a decision - is kicking them out worth the pain of replacing them? In some cases, (PFC Drunk and Stupid) the answer is yes. In others, you ignore it and say, ""Well, he's kinda chubby and can't run very fast, but he's an excellent supply clerk."" That being said, fat people and people who can't shoot have a lot of problems getting promoted because your physical fitness scores and rifle range scores greatly impact your eligibility for promotion.

Now, officers are completely different from enlisted. Because they are subjected to much greater demands, (leadership and original thinking instead of saying ""Aye aye sir"" ten times fast) they are much harsher on making sure that officers can do whatever that needs doing. So yes, every officer needs to be a rifleman. That fat-ass supply clerk, on the other hand? Not really.

There may be a medical reason which you could get checked out if you wanted to fix being LL.  But you don't have to, if you're OK with yourself this way.  That's kind of the question, isn't it?

Please don't check out /n/nofap.  Not masturbating at all reduces testosterone and long-term can even literally shrink your dick.  It's a terrible idea.  Men need to orgasm sometimes, it's built into your anatomy.  How often, as you know, is very individual.

IF you get sexually attracted/interested for the first few months and then it goes back to your normal once-in-a-while thing that's normal.  During infatuation - what poly people call ""NRE"" - brain chemistry goes into overdrive, and also ramps up sex drive in almost everyone.  (Which is how people with mismatched libidos can not realize it until months or years later).

I guess the question is do you want to ramp up your sex drive (which may or may not be possible) or do you want to find women who are happy with your natural libido level?  The latter is certainly possible - there are many self-identified asexual women who are OK having sex once in a while but don't crave it who would be thrilled to find a guy like you."

TheBlackDahliaMurder,Fitness,1388857868.0,"You have a lot to fix, but to me, the biggest issues are lack of upper back and core tightness. You can see on your way down that your back rounds pretty badly, and this is a result of lack of tightness in those 2 areas. Your upper back should be extremely tight throughout the entire movement. You should be squeezing your shoulder blades together and take as close a grip on the bar as your flexibility allows. Also, if doing high bar squats (can't tell from this video), point your elbows straight down as this helps keep your back tight.

Now to the lower half, you're pushing your knees forward. You need to widen your stance a little and focus on opening your hips by pushing your knees out (as in, away from each other) and pushing your hips back as you sink into your squat. 

On your way up, especially on later reps, your hips want to shoot up before your torso does. This could be a result of lack of back and core tightness. But your shoulders and hips should be rising at the same rate.

Lastly, you're not hitting parallel."

It's possible he was cheating on you the entire time - I certainly wouldn't trust him to be honest about it.  My DB from a former relationship involved a guy who still masturbated a lot (sometimes several times a day!), but wouldn't have sex with me very often at all.  Eventually I found out he was cheating on me, in some pretty heinous ways.  He was just an emotionally stunted man child who compartmentalized sex and was fundamentally lazy and wasn't a good partner and cared only about satisfying his whims instead of working to build a happy sex life based on mutual satisfaction.

bananaruth,AskReddit,1388858573.0,"&gt; your take on things is adorable. and could only come from a women.

Ahh, I've found why you have trouble dating. Patronizing someone doesn't come off well.

&gt; I get that the world is an adorable place to be a woman cause people are nicer and no one really expects much.

Example #2 of why you are having trouble. People expect a lot from women. They are just different expectations than those set for men. I'm expected to always look good. I'm expected to have children, take care of them, clean the house, cook meals, and have a job, My family always expected me to get good grades, go to a good college, get a good job etc. Men expect me to be interested in them if they're interested in me. If I'm not then I'm a bitch, if I am then I'm a whore. It's expected that I want to squeeze a child out of my vagina at least once. People expect women to be generally submissive, so if a woman in business is slightly aggressive, she's bossy. A man in a similar position would be deemed a go-getter. There are many more examples of the expectations that I'm constantly under, but sure. Go on thinking that nothing is expected of women and they just prance about doing as they please. 

Third, relationships don't just fall into our laps as easily as you may think. Sure, every time I've been to a club I've been hit on, but it's usually by creepy guys. You seem to have a problem with the idea that men can be creepy. I'm 22. I don't want a 35 year old hitting on me. I don't want you to approach me at night while I'm alone. There are certainly people who are creepy or do creepy things. 

I personally don't like clubs or bars, so it does get a little more difficult for me to find dates as well (my friends drag me along every now and then). You can tell a lot of guys just want sex and if I'm not looking for just sex, that's a no. Regardless of gender, it can be difficult to find a meaningful relationship. 

I do think it's outdated, but the solution is having more women ask men out. Not changing the idea that whoever asks someone out pays.

Chinese workers remain one of the hardest working people, from children to adult they either labor in cram schools or Apple factories.  What's your point?

&gt;Most of the faults of today can be summed by the injustice of how the wealth is distributed, not how it's obtained (tech), so China isn't a naturally flow from tech. 

I'm not blaming tech itself.  But tech only exacerbates injustices.  And because it does so, it must be removed.

&gt; The freedom argument isn't a good one either, free speech and classless universal equality weren't even applied ideas until industrial times, 

That's a very Western centric way of looking at things, and is not accurate for development of similar philosophical ideas in the east.

I know I'm late to this, but I wanted to do my best to give you what you asked for: Scriptural evidence that the JW religion is wrong.

1.) Disfellowshipping. First of all, the JW's didn't practice disfellowshipping back in 1919 when they say Jesus inspected and chose them as his organization. They didn't introduce disfellowshipping until the 1950's. So it would seem that if we accept that Jesus chose this organization as his earthly representative, he was not *for* disfellowshipping.

Additionally, certain scriptures used to support DF'ing, are taken out of context or pushed to an extreme interpretation that they don't support. I'll outline them below, but you can read them yourself and see if you agree:

Luke 6:27-37: Jesus says not to judge, but rather love everyone, including our enemies. Is disfellowshipping, including throwing children out of the house and refusing to speak with them *loving*?

&gt; But I say to you who are listening, Continue to love your enemies, to do good to those hating you, to bless those cursing you, to pray for those who are insulting you.

&gt; Continue becoming merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Moreover, stop judging, and you will by no means be judged; and stop condemning, and you will by no means be condemned.

You can look up and read the whole passage yourself, but those are the highlights of Jesus' teaching.

Matthew 18:15-17 Jesus establishes how to treat a wrongdoer:

&gt;Moreover, if your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two more, in order that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter may be established. If he does not listen to them, speak to the congregation. If he does not listen even to the congregation, let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.

As a *tax collector*. OK, how does one deal with tax collectors? How did Jesus treat tax collectors, then? 

Matthew 9:11, 12

&gt;But on seeing this the Pharisees began to say to his disciples: ""Why is it that your teacher eats with tax collectors and sinners?"" (12) Hearing them, he said: ""Persons in health do not need a physician, but the ailing do.

Again, you can read this yourself, but it's quite clear that Jesus did not endorse cutting off sinners completely, but rather to continue to associate with them in ways that might prove to be uplifting to them. Such ones were *no worse off* in Jesus eyes than anyone else outside the Christian congregation.

2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14-15 Paul's writings are often cited as the template for the Society's practice of disfellowshipping. Yet again and again in Paul's words, although he does say to limit association with repeat sinners, he says they are *still our Brothers*. 

&gt; Now we are giving you orders, brothers, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the tradition YOU received from us . (14) But if anyone is not obedient to our word through this letter, keep this one marked, stop associating with him, that he may become ashamed. (15) **And yet do not be considering him as an enemy, but continue admonishing him as a brother.**

There are many other scriptural references similar to this, and Paul does indeed endorse *limiting* time spent with such ones, but in every single instance, he still says such ones are to be considered Brothers. It's quite clear from reading the context that while one might limit friendly social interaction, that a sinner under Paul's guidelines should nevertheless be warmly welcomed at meetings for worship.

Lastly, even Paul, who apparently took a bit harder line on this than Jesus, didn't say *everyone* should engage in the rebuke:

&gt;2 Corinthians 2:5-6 ""Now if anyone has caused sadness, he has saddened, not me, but all of you to an extent — **not to be too harsh in what I say**. This rebuke given by the *majority* is sufficient for such a man, …""

Feel free to read the passage yourself. What Paul seems to be counseling is precisely *against* the Society's strict practice of disfellowshipping. Taken as a WHOLE rather than cherry-picking scriptures, his advice seems to be ""OK, there's some bad apples - you want to be careful of them. Maybe don't eat a meal with them, don't go to the movies. But dammit, don't be a fucking asshole, OK? We want to leave the judging to God, so you know, *mostly* rebuke them, but don't go too far. If you hurt them, you hurt me.""

*Read it yourself* and see if I mischaracterized Paul in any way. And remember, Paul was known to be the hardass of the apostles! Jesus' own guidance is much more gentle!

OK, so that's a lot right there.

There's much more. Do you know the bible doesn't promise an earthly resurrection? In fact, even the JW's didn't believe in it originally. They initially thought all of them were going to heaven…up to 144,000. But when their group grew to exceed 144,000 by quite a lot, they had to come up with something to offer the vast majority of believers who obviously wouldn't fit into heaven. 

""Paradise"" only appears *four times* in the whole bible, and when an accompanying passage refers to location, it refers to heaven.

Song of Solomon 4:13

Luke 23:39-43

2 Corinthians 12:1-7

Revelation 2:5-7

The phrase ""paradise of God"" is used, which the Watchtower itself says is heaven:

&gt; Eating in ""the Paradise of God."" Revelation 2:7 mentions a ""tree of life"" in ""the paradise of God"" and that eating from it would be the privilege of the one ""that conquers."" Since other promises given in this section of Revelation to such conquering ones clearly relate to their gaining a heavenly inheritance (Re 2:26-28; 3:12, 21), it seems evident that ""the paradise of God"" in this case is a heavenly one."" Insight on the Scriptures, Volume 2 p.576 Paradise

Luke 23:42-43 is the only biblical scripture *at all* where the Watchtower says ""paradise"" refers to earth. Why? Read the scripture yourself - Jesus says ""Truly I tell you today, You will be with me in Paradise.""

The Watchtower says:

&gt;To such ones who had the hope of being received into heaven, Christ promised: ""To him that conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."" (Revelation 2:7; John 16:33; 1 John 5:4) This figurative ""paradise of God"" is in the invisible heavens. However, is it correct to assume that heaven is the only paradise set before all of Jesus' followers? Since the sympathetic evildoer did not conquer the world by pursuing a course of faithfulness to God but was justly being put to death for his wicked deeds, what Paradise did Christ promise him? Indeed, the Bible does promise an earthly Paradise!"" Watchtower 1983 Oct 15 p.4 Does the Bible Promise and Earthly Paradise

Read that carefully. They are saying this ONE scripture supports their fundamental teaching of a paradise earth because…*they say so*. That's it. All other scriptural references to paradise they agree refer to heaven. This one alone doesn't explicitly say heaven or earth, so they *arbitrarily* say it's earth because THEY presume to speak for Jesus: ""The sinner can't possibly be going to heaven, that's ridiculous! Jesus wouldn't have been kind and forgiving to a *sinner*, so therefore he must mean earth!"" 

And THAT'S IT for paradise earth.

If ""The Good News"", the over-arching message of the bible and basis for Jehovah's Witness teaching is that we have the promise of living in a paradise earth…if that's the POINT of the bible, don't you think the bible would have more to say about it than that?! 

Think back to all those promises in the Society literature. All those illustrations of people and animals and green grass and blue sky… and remember: One scripture. Just Jesus promising a sinner on a torture stake that the sinner would be with him in Paradise.

What do you think? Was Jesus intending this to be the foundation for an entire earthly hope that he simply neglected to elaborate on? Or was he kindly granting the sinner clemency in his final moments of life, personifying love, forgiveness, kindness…all those traits Jesus is known for?"

In the short run this is true, but in the long run technology drives human history.  As society becomes more reliant on technology and cannot maintain itself without it, technology becomes the invisible fist by which it drives the development and progression of humanity.   Carr's book on the effect of the internet on the evolution of the human mind comes to mind, and is a worthy read: http://www.amazon.com/The-Shallows-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393339750/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388859179&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+shallows"

If Tigers go the way of the Dodo and we perceive any immediate ecological affects, I'm sure we humans will find a solution and put it into effect that substitutes in place of the Tiger.

Morally, this is incorrect. We have a duty to preserve the planet and ensure all its inhabitants do not suffer needlessly at our hands. Tiger is a majestic cat and seeing it in person is an awesome experience.

Weirdsauce,ShouldIbuythisgame,1388860020.0,"BF 4 Pros:
 
- Looks great
- Maps are good to very good although some are FAR too open, allowing snipers to have a field day
- Sounds great
- Lots of game play modes
- Commander mode is back
- AA devices (Igla/ Stinger) can acquire and deploy to target efficiently but damage does not appear to be as much as it was in BF3
- Good physics
- Destructible environments, structures

BF 4 Cons:

* Looks great at expense of your GPU. If you don't have a 78XX (or whatever the NVIDIA equivalent is, performance will be diminished)
* It's not Battlefield 2143 (biased observation as BF2142 is my favorite FPS of all time)
* EA believes we can't play a game without it being web based. That's why no one could ever play BF 1942, BF Vietnam, BF2 or BF 2142 apparently. BF3 and  BF4 are redonkulous [sic] in this regard.

I'm sure i could think of other things but i'll leave the list there. 

As for BF3 v BF4, it's hard to say. Outside of new maps, a changed way of earning unlocks for weapons or playing ""dress up"" on them and graphics improvements, i'm not sure there's much difference. Just because you put lipstick on a pig doesn't mean you have a new pig. 

Oh- and if you're interested in the single player experience of either- hell if i know. I don't think anyone other than reviewers play the single player parts of Battlefield. It's kind of an afterthought or marketing gimmick as far as i can tell. The previous Battlefield games didn't have ""plot"" and i seem to remember they fared rather well- but if EA wants to throw their money down that hole, along with Origin, that's their business- but just because someone calls a turd ""pudding"", it doesn't make it so. 

You aren't going to go wrong either way. They're both good shooters but clearly EA has abandoned BF3 well before it was fully exploited. The future, where EA is concerned, is **definitely** Battlefield 4 - until next year or so, i bet. "

Lets take a different angle at this.  I think a good project for you could be the following:

* Identify some ""ideal"" roles that meet your needs (being outdoors, etc.)
* Using your network (friends, neighbors, family, FB, Twitter, etc), connect with some people **doing that work now** and do some [Informational Interviews](http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/mastering-the-informational-interview/) over coffee to find out more about their jobs and the qualifications you'd need
* Adjust as needed to narrow down your focus, and then ideally, you'll be in a place where you can make a bigger decision.

jongbag,changemyview,1388860236.0,"&gt;**tl;dr** the sum total of your argument seems to be ""why can't the Constitution mean whatever we want it to mean at this moment?

That's not quite my argument, but it's close. My view is without a doubt an argument of utility. If we lived in an ideal (or anywhere remotely close to ideal) system of government that accurately reflected the will of the people, I would agree with you and hold that we should adhere to the original spirit of the Constitution exactly, and amend it whenever necessary.

But we don't live under a properly functioning government. Our law-making process is broken, and instead of the will of the people, we get the will of the corporations and the will of the people *with money* represented. That, of course, is when anything manages to get passed at all, considering that we have one of the most ineffective legislatures in our country's history.


So, if we can acknowledge that our government has a problem, we should try and fix it, and make it more representative of the will of the people. That is doubtlessly a long and difficult process that will be fraught with obstacles- including, but not limited to, all of the extremely powerful people that benefit from the power and wealth imbalance as it is, and who will use all of their considerable resources to prevent any meaningful change from happening.

So, if we can further agree that changing the government to make it more representative will be a lengthy and difficult process, what ought we do in the meantime? That is, in the years it will take to make government work again, should we put all of the pressing matters our country faces on hold and continue to rely on an increasingly outdated and irrelevant form of the Constitution? Or should we find other means to reflect the will of our society in the meantime?

I vote for the latter. There are too many important issues facing us that cannot and should not wait any longer to be dealt with.

You're not a sex addict, and him not wanting it as much as you doesn't mean he isn't attracted to you.  That said, it's wrong of him to dismiss how you feel.  

I think it would be best to have a talk outside of the bedroom, when sex isn't expected, as calmly as possible.  Is he feeling depressed?  Stressed?  Does he just not want it that much?

I thought about this for myself, do I offer anything unique or novel? It's a question I dont know how to answer. I'm not insanely attractive and my skill level is above average but not crazy awesome. The only things I feel are semi unique about myself is that I am very frank and can speak to anyone as if I've known them forever, and I am currently employed at a game design studio.

This was SUPER awesome, as it taught me all sorts of things about automation. Having understanding of MC automation beyond the very basics? I learned all that in EE. 

And EE1 made things much cheaper, but not free. This meant I got to play with all kinds of things, and work with huge parts of the tech tree, but I still had some incentive to be vaguely efficient, especially since it didn't take away the time cost.

EE1 taught me almost everything I know about automation and how it works in Minecraft. I don't know if EE1 forced everyone to think, but the way I played it, it gave me problems to think about that were hard, but weren't stupid hard.

If he didn't bump his head and became mentally challenged (from a Saiyan perspective) wimp that does not enjoy mass murder, [he would have done it, too](http://www.dragonball-multiverse.com/en/page-595.html#h_read). DB would bave been a story about proto-Z fighters like Roshi, Tien and Yamcha trying to stop the murderous Saiyan.

Otherwise, global threats (not counting movies) were so rare that they were almost non-existent. A lot of them did come as a side effect of the heroes' activities.

Red Ribbon Army was a massive, yet conventional, realistic threat. This large paramilitary could have [probably] been dealt with using conventional armies of various nations.

King Piccolo would still have been at the bottom of the ocean if he was not resurrected by Pilaf, who was that desperate only because he could do nothing else against Goku.

Raditz would have been an extension of the ""Kakarot problem"", a warrior coming to pick up his little bro after a successful mission. Vegeta would not have heard of the Dragonballs, and Frieza would not have bothered with the planet as Kakarot was already his Earth-defeating instrument.

Cell and the Androids were purpose-built vengeance weapons against Goku.

Buu was a space magician's pet project that was stalled for millenia since there was not enough battery power to get things started, and it would have stayed that way for millenia more if highly unusual circumstances did not create a generation of ultra-strong fighters.

statusrobot,AskWomen,1388863802.0,"Cute is a good thing most of the time. I always mean it as a good thing. Some women use it in a dismissive way and I can tell from their tone that they don't think it's a good thing, but most women I know describe people they're interested in as ""cute"" at some point or another. And even if they're not interested, it's still a positive thing in general. I describe guys I am attracted to as cute, but I also sometimes use it for guys I don't find attractive.

Here's how I use different compliment words, in general. I may use them if one or more of the listed conditions are true (rarely are they all true at once).

**Cute:** Something about the person or their actions is particularly endearing. I think they're being sweet in an attractive way. I've caught them in a moment when their guard is down or their ""man mask"" is off and they are attractive in a somewhat vulnerable way (smiling in his sleep, playing with kittens, helping me with some project that isn't really his thing). He is good-looking in a boyish or young-looking kind of way. He is good-looking in general and I like him.

**Adorable:** Their cuteness is currently overwhelming. I am hit with a wave of affection for the person.

**Good-looking:** He looks good physically. He's conventionally attractive. I find him physically attractive.

**Attractive:** I'm into whatever he just did or said. I'm attracted to him. I'm looking for a new physical compliment word to use or am intentionally using a generic one.

**Hot:** I am physically attracted to the person but can't think of a way to describe how. I know the guy doesn't like the word ""cute"" but I want to tell him he's good-looking. I think he's attractive in a manly or sexual way.

**Sexy:** I am interested in having sex with the person. I think the person is good-looking in a particularly sexual way. I am looking for a new way to describe how good-looking the person is. I think the person is really, really hot.

Note that I would almost NEVER use ""hot"" or ""sexy"" to describe a man I wasn't dating to his face, unless we had a relationship that allowed for casually flirtatious conversations. Those are both really personal/sexual descriptors that can imply more than I'm comfortable with. It's not really something people do in my experience. I'd use them when talking about someone, but not when talking to him, because that's the way things are done socially."

You be surprised how wrong you are a lot of the time. Sadly, most people stop reading after high school.

&gt;It would surprise you how smart people who actually read books are. People who don't read at all and instead spend all day browsing on the internet and playing video games are the uneducated.

Most of the time, my first thought is that kissing is a really weird thing to do and I can't imagine why people do it for fun. Then I go kiss my boyfriend and remember that kissing is *awesome.* If I happen to kiss someone with good technique and a similar kissing style, I suppose I know it's a good kiss in an abstract sort of way, but I don't enjoy it in the all-over emotional/sexual way that I do with someone I'm actively into.

The physical sensation of lips together isn't really the most important thing I get out of kissing, though - it's the overall experience of being close to someone I'm into and kissing them and knowing they're kissing me and communicating things through the kiss."

1) You definitely nailed it with people really affecting me/you/maybe all INFJs? so it really makes us vulnerable being hurt by people we respect and care about. Also that process of what happens when people disappoint you is spot on, god it feels so good to be around people who think the same way I do.

2) I think  *maybe* it's a good idea to put in more patience and energy to people who have negative facets but if it were me, I'd be sure their positive aspects were worth it. I find myself getting even more hurt the more I invest in people and then if they disappoint me it hurts like 10x more because I tried so hard.

So that's my opinion on it. Just like to contribute! Glad to see a late night stream-of-consciousness epiphany type thing on here though cause I have these all the time and I'm too like afraid to share them with anyone lest they are misinterpreted and then I just feel dumb."

So if someone is what you might describe as a 97 on a 1-100 scale of ""straightness"", they've likely *always* been a 97 and will always *be* a 97, but while they're overwhelmingly mostly attracted to members of the opposite gender, there's always the rare same-gender individual that will be attractive to them, or the occasional slim chance of a same-gender hookup or relationship or whatever.

Neebat,technology,1388865133.0,"I'm an advocate for driverless cars.  They need to happen because they'll save lives and improve our lives.

But among advocates for driverless cars, I tend to be the lone voice pointing out political and financial realities.  A car crash is owned by the driver today, who is usually [judgment-proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_proof).  Without changing the laws, that liability will transfer to the automakers, who will lose billions of dollars to lawsuits, mostly frivolous.

So, we have to change the laws to put driverless cars on the streets.  (Google's experiments still use a driver behind the wheel at all times, even though that driver may not be touching the wheel for the entire trip.)  And, to change the laws, we need to woo politicians.

Job losses are POISON to politicians.  They tend to get crazy when there's a chance of widespread job loss, especially when unions are involved.  Look at the fights that Uber has gone through just to match drivers with passengers.  It's going to be 1000 times worse when taxi drivers realize they won't have a job any more.

Politics, finance, liability matter.  Hell, I've seen advocates deny basic biology in an effort to claim driverless cars will be radically different.  (No, people aren't comfortable facing the rear of a vehicle in traffic!  The balance system of the body depends on visual stimulation, and a large percentage of people will throw up if you face them the wrong way.)

It's easy to let your passion for driverless cars blind you to the realities of the world we live in.   Willful ignorance will not bring the revolution faster."

You can easily calculate how many amps a particular build will draw! Voltage divided by resistance = amp draw!

EXAMPLE: batt output: 3.7 (personally I always calculate at 4.2 as that is the max output of a fully charged batt. Build resistance...lets say .5 ohms

4.2/.5=8.4. In this case, 8.4 is the amp draw on this build. .5 is the lowest you should go on batteries rated for 10amp draw.

Society teaches us that a woman's life is worth more than a man's life, and men internalize that. It's a big part of why men are almost 20x more likely to die at the workplace, because they devalue their own lives to the point where risking their life for a paycheck doesn't faze them. 

Unfortunately this belief feeds off itself. The government devalues men's lives because society devalues men's lives, and society devalues men's lives because the government devalues men's lives. It's hard to get out of that cycle, but it's starting to change."

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1388865505.0,"&gt; It's a League of Legends stream, not ""Sub now for $4.99 and see the really good stuff, boys!""

I assume it would be against the Twitch tos if she actually showed any real stuff on twitch directly though, right? 

The thing is, what if hypothetically something like that were to actually happen. Let's say there is a well known web porn actress/dominatrix who picked up gaming out of curiosity, did that occasionally and even used to it advertise her pay porn site (again, good chance that that would be against twitch tos even if she showed no actual stuff on twitch itself, but I'm no expert, let's talk hypthetically) would that be so wrong? 

I think what makes the whole thing so complicated is that it almost feels more like lying if they aren't actual porn people, it's that some people actually get off more on the teasing/the potential. But I'm kinda at the point where I think that that is their problem, if that is their kink/what gets the going. 

The problem is that if you are serious about gaming it's kinda like promoting let's say opera or high quality rock to a world that listens to Katy Perry or Justin Bieber. It's just not gonna work for everybody/you gotta live with the idea that some people just have different/bad/unsophisticated taste in music. In reality there isn't much you can do except maybe promote the quality of your own stuff and sing its praises (how about a directory for high skill level gamer girls?) and hope that that will pay off eventually even if it frustrating that it seems that some other strategies pay out more quickly. 

The other factor is that not everybody uses youtube or twitch the same way. Some people are there to get genuine information and for example learn skills and strategies, but a lot of people also treat it almost more like a replacement for a radio that they let run in the background and what they are looking for is actually more shallow content/they actually aren't into something that is more serious and hence don't necessarily value people that take their games more seriously.

Tokyocheesesteak,dbz,1388866810.0,"Dragon Ball: a fantasy (with strong sci-fi elements) adventure about a child traveling the world with his friends, where he looks for the magical [plot device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin) while saving innocents and learning life lessons. Loosely based on ancient Chinese Journey to the West, a Buddhist tale of a superpowered yet goofy monkey-man that travels the world to find Buddhist scrolls. Journey to the West was, in great part, loosely based on ancient Hindu myths like Hanuman.

Dragon Ball Z: a sci-fi (with strong fantasy elements) adventure-drama that effectively answers the question ""what would happen if that super-child from the previous story grew up and settled as a family man, all while continuing to build his already otherworldly potential"". Ancient Chinese narrative is almost entirely replaced with modern Western adventure themes, like superheroes, space travel, and killer robots from the future. The final chapter sort of reverts to the fantasy theme, as it's basically a story about a magical space genie that was impossible to contain once unleashed from his ""bottle"" (reminiscent of the King Piccolo theme from fantasy-oriented Dragon Ball).

I watched bits and pieces when I was an 11 year old kid in the late 90's-early 00's. I didn't understand much at all, since I barely spoke English. It was all ""balahagarabaha KAMEHAME-HAA! balabalablablabla"", some stupid but fun Anime show to watch at my friend's house while playing with LEGOs. 

About ten years later I decided to actually watch the whole thing from start to finish. I was in a pretty deep, alcohol-soaked rut and I really needed *something* new in my life, and DB/DBZ turned out to be just the uplifting thing that I needed, a break from my cynical angst and outright violent environment. I'm not a total bum - by that time I was around 23 and have already lived/worked on three continents, and one of those jobs involved designing the new World Trade Center in New York. But at that time, I was at a pretty low point, struggling to finish college, no girlfriend in years, still living in the hood (yes, ye olde stereotypical hood with gangsters and shootings and robberies, which is not as glamorous as it seems in rap songs and movies), and still mentally recovering from some events that shook my life dramatically a few years earlier. DBZ became my ticket out of this cycle of darkness and cynicism. For a children's show, a cartoon that has been imitated so much that it became a cliche, it is surprisingly, incredibly uplifting and inspiring. Despite all of its tension, drama and murder, it is never actually cynical. There is always this brightness, this positivity that permeates even the darkest situations. It's a show about a character that believes that *there is no upper limit to one's potential*. Think about that for a minute. I'm willing to bet money that wherever you are, OP, whoever you are, you have untapped potential in you that you are not utilizing to the fullest, stuff that would make you into an incredible person if you worked harder at it. This show makes you do a double take about your own abilities. It made me think deeper about my own abilities, that I get in life as far as I'm willing to take myself, and that, for practical purposes, there is no built-in upper limit for our development as human beings. That same character also manages to stay as humble, down to earth and optimistic as a person can get, despite being arguably the strongest being in the universe.

At that time, character-wise, I was much closer to Vegeta, Goku's foil that, despite being almost as powerful, is a rather miserable person because he spends much of his time mourning unfulfilled dreams, notions of destiny and birthright, focusing on petty competition with a friend who happens to do better than us (don't we all have a friend like that?), and thinking about what could have been rather than enjoying life as it is (like Goku). It took him most of the show to overcome his inner demons and, by accepting reality of life and giving up his jealousies, finally attains inner peace. I'm sure I'm not the only twenty-something who could relate to this existential angst where, if we take a step back, we realize that a lot of this misery was actually a construct in our own head. Even then, this is a character that, despite his victim complex, never cut himself or anyone else any slack, believing that hard work is the only way to better a person and that slackers deserve to be left behind. Once again, I'm sure I'm not the only person that needs to re-evaluate his work ethic.

And that's only Vegeta. Most of these ""Z fighters"" are similarly troubled egoists and villains that went through comparable character development, where they overcome their conceit and get their act together. I **do not** recommend starting with Kai, partly because I don't like the voices/music/amount of stuff they cut out, especially given how much of this character development was left out as ""filler"" (though they did get rid of *some* rather useless filler) - but that's just me, what do I know?

Another reason I was so attracted to this show is because I finally got to understand glimpses of images that have been with me since I was a kid. Apparently, *a lot* of the show stuck in my subconscious since those early watchings (which took place during a definitive moment in my life when I shifted to another level by moving to a new country), and my mind was blown when characters from my ""imagination"" and vivid, inspiring scenes from some of my grandest dreams that pushed me forward as a person throughout my teens, were actually based on what I saw in the show.

I'm 25 now, graduated college, living in New York, working a full time job that pays for my apartment, loans, and then some. I still have personal weaknesses and issues I could be working on, but physically and mentally I'm in a *much* better place than I was 2-3 years ago. I'd attribute a lot of my shift towards positivity to DBZ. It partially helped me quit cigarettes cold turkey and keeps inspiring me to get my full architect certification, reminding me that I need to keep on grinding and pushing if I want to move on to the next level - otherwise I would grow soft, complacent, and be left in the dust by those that know that there *is* no upper ceiling, the ones that know how to let go of their insecurities and focus on the good things in life rather than wallowing in sadness about what could have/should have been instead."

I used to be self-conscious, but sometime in my late 30's I ran out of fucks to give.

Always a perfectionist, but I expect less of others.  If the person behind the cash register was a rocket scientist, she'd be working for NASA, not checking out my groceries.  Still frustrating when people can't/won't do their jobs right, but I get less angry about others' incompetence now.

I try not to correct others' grammar, although sloppiness in that area still bothers me with people who ought to know better.  Like newspaper writers/editors.  I stopped getting the local paper for that reason, and I'm much happier as a result.

More social as a result of being less self-conscious.  I still recharge by spending time alone, but I can be social at work and when I go out, which isn't that often.  I can truly enjoy going out if I get enough alone time, which I do following my divorce. 

I've become very tolerant of others' life choices.  I don't have to live their life, and there are so many *right* ways to do things - who am I to judge them?  OK, sometimes I judge them silently, but it's more in a shaking my head kind of way and not a looking down kind of way.

I am happier.  Life is good.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1388867073.0,"Here's the thing...you said that there is a correlation that exists for women but does not exist for men. These studies don't say that.

The first study says this in conclusion: ""This study established a strong association between number of sex partners and later substance disorder, especially for women, which persisted beyond prior substance use and mental health problems more generally."" See where it says ""especially for women""? That is the clincher. This sentence means that there is a strong association between number of sex partners and substance abuse *for men as well as women*. It happens more with women, but it happens for men too. You say that there is no correlating damage for men, but this study says otherwise. The fact that it happens more to women doesn't mean you get to totally ignore the fact that it also happens to men.

Second link: ""As the number of reported alcohol-related behaviors increased, the adjusted proportion of respondents who had recently had multiple partners rose from 8% to 48% among females and from 23% to 61% among men."" Wait a sec - this isn't what you thought it was! ""The proportion who had had multiple partners in the past three months increased from 7% among currently sexually active females who reported no alcohol-related behaviors to 61% among those who reported all five behaviors; among males, these proportions were 28% and 65%, respectively."" This study shows that guys who drink have more sexual partners than girls who drink. It also showed that men are more promiscuous than women overall, and that they start having sex younger. This study doesn't show that sex damages people - this one is about the effects of alcohol on the number of sexual partners, and it appears that women have fewer sex partners than men when alcohol is involved. It even showed that the more sex partners guys have, the less likely they are to use condoms. You have to read to the bottom to see that data, but it's there. The study concludes with this: ""Our data show both similarities and differences in numbers of sexual partners by gender. Adolescent males were more likely than females to report multiple partners, both in the past three months and over their lifetime. Sexually experienced males were also more likely to report having had no partners in the previous three months. These patterns suggest fundamental differences in the stability of relationships for males and females, and may reflect different approaches to experiencing and understanding sexual relationships. Despite these differences, similar sets of risk factors were associated with multiple partners among males and females."" Read that last sentence again.  : )

The third study, on marriage and cohabitation and divorce, was only performed on women. No men were studied to determine whether this was something that happened to them too. Right off the bat that makes me suspicious of your use of this study as ""proof"". Until and unless I see a corresponding study performed on men proving that premarital sex and cohabitation have no effect on the success of men's marriages, I'm not going to regard this study as having any bearing on this discussion because it's entirely one-sided.

The fourth study is not something I'm able to read; you have to pay $12 to do so and that's not happening. It does not, however, indicate in the little blurb about the article that sex damages women but does not damage men. It appears that this is not a study about sex doing psychological damage, but rather, a study regarding what sort of psychological differences exist between the genders with regards to selecting a mate. That's kinda not really what you and I have been discussing.

The fifth study is about domestic violence. It has nothing to do with the topic at hand, however, I'm going to save it because it'll come in handy during discussions of domestic abuse...people always claim that almost all victims are women and almost all abusers are men, and that's just not true. Having this to show as evidence will be useful.

The sixth study looks intriguing; I wish I could read the whole thing. However, again, it doesn't appear to shore up your argument that having sex with lots of men is harmful to women and not to men. It is a study about the factors that lead to divorce, which it lists as: age at marriage, education, premarital births and conception, religion, parental divorce, and race. Not gender. It does not in any way seem to indicate that this is a study proving that having multiple partners harms women but not men. It isn't about that.

You've seen the fervor with which this administration (and the previous one, to be fair) go after leakers, right? There is essentially no whistleblower protection for the issues involved at present. If such a thing existed in reality then yes absolutely he should have done that, but it clearly does not exists currently. 

Snowden appears to see himself as a patriot, and had a self-imposed patriotic mission to accomplish. I think it was obvious to him that going through channels such as those you suggest would have a high chance of failure to accomplish the goal. 

He apparently tried his superiors in the executive branch, and got nowhere.  

How about the legislative branch? Congress is not noted for its ability to keep secrets or offer individuals meaningful protection against a vengeful executive. [1] Even if it were, the present state of party politics would cause disclosures via that route to be turned into a partisan football, rather than an issue of importance to all. 

So the executive branch is out, congress is out, maybe the courts? Not a chance. The courts have pretty specific rules about how to handle these issues, and listening to a man off the street is simply not allowed. 

It's easy to point out his individual actions as potentially criminal, and doing so is fairly reasonable. But it is important to keep it in the context of the larger crimes his actions exposed. Exposing them was a public service, and there appears to have been no other way to get it done.

I would argue that that is more Chinese than Western/American, based on what I see in everyday life in New York as well as from what I can perceive in books and popular culture.  Western/American culture is intensely individualistic, and promotes one to pursue one's wants and desires with little regard for others.

I'm not seeing your point with Above and Beyond, though.

walternate482,AskMen,1388868602.0,"Yeah, he would. Keep in mind that where extroverted people can gain energy from talking to people, for introverted people, that act in itself is more tiring. That's not to say he doesn't enjoy it, just that we are less likely to initiate as often because we don't *need* it like others do. Kind of like how some people don't eat as much as others just because it's less interesting to them.

It sounds like he took you to a place he really likes, but got nervous in the moment. Most likely he is not responding positively because he's subconsciously afraid of opening himself up and potentially messing up/getting rejected. Making a move can sometimes seem like impinging on someone who doesn't necessarily want you on top of them. For some of us it's easy to forget that the other person might actually want it too.

If he didn't like you he wouldn't initiate at all, he wouldn't respond much, and his face and tone would likely show that he wasn't interested. If you're happy to initiate and can let him know you'd like him to do the same, then I bet you'll both end up happy :)
