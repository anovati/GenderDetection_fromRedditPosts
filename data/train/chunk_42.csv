gazork_chumble_spuzz,running,1390798993.0,"&gt;This kind of thing happens, but EXTREMELY rarely. I've been running for several years, and run ~70 miles/week all of it outdoors, (Though, to be fair, some of my weekly mileage is on a track where the people can't really throw things at you, so I'd say about 60mpw of actual area where people could hit me.) and have had one incident where people have thrown something at me. She has been running ~17 miles/week for about 4.5 months, a good portion of it, according to her blog, on a treadmill, so the miles where she could actually get hit are closer to about ~10mpw.

She's also 300 pounds and slow, and that makes her a far more likely target than the skinny dude who clearly knows what he's doing. You can't assume that because *you* have only had it happen once, therefore she's full of shit. That makes no sense. If you were also a 300 pound woman running in the same area as her, then maybe, *maybe* you'd have something to go on, but I'm guessing you aren't. Your math is sound, but the reasoning behind it is not. I still think, too, that it's silly to try and convince us all that she's lying but then expecting us all to believe that you've had stuff thrown at you without offering proof of your own."

Unfortunately, on that same note, Kerouac especially refused to muse on these points for too long.

For that you spend quite a lot of time of your pitch here talking about her. Maybe you should work on that and talk more about what you want to do and what that will bring to the table rather than just about what you don't want to do. 

Why don't you just ban her/her supposed mistakes from your mind and try to focus on yourself and what your opinions on represention is and what bugs YOU personally about it. And once you figured that out think about how to best communicate that to people. 

Fe. if your main problem is that you wish you could be playing the games people could be making you could talk about the struggles of developers who make exactly these kind of games, struggles to get funded, struggles to find an audience and sell, struggle to bridge the gap between hardcore and casual with the risk of not appealing to anybody. Or what about the games that did succeed and if they succeeded, why did they succeed and with whom did they succeed (predomantly males, predominantly females, an equal mixture of the two). 

For example: 

1.) Where is the money really at in gaming. How much truth is there to people strongly prefering or connecting more deeply to games that have a protagonist of their own gender and/or race? To which games does this apply to the most and what can be done within that gameplay style to overcome this? If this problem is only an issue in certain types of games (think of abstract puzzle games vs. rpgs vs. shooters) why do people care so much for those type of games over others? 

2.) If we presume that all above stereotypes about female protagonists needing female purchasers and purchasers being found more likely in the casual space, why do games even try to appeal to both, casual and non-casual? Is it the lure of games that actually managed to be successfull in both like The Sims for example? Is it an ego or personal narrative thing that drives people to want to suck up/appeal to the non-casual crowd rather than just creating the best casual game in the universe? Is the casual market just unsuitable for deeper experiences, but people still have the desire to produce deeper experiences? Do casual players even have any need or desire for more in depth experiences? What games convince people who don't play many games or mostly play casual games to come outside their comfort zone for games like Dragon Age Origins or The Sims or World of Warcraft? 

Or you could talk about what genres are more accepting of female protagonists (Adventure and HOPA, Horror Games) and which genres are least accepting of it. You could question how important female protagonist really are compared to ""customize your own"" and ""pick from a roster"" and ""abstract/undefined/unseen/godlike main character"" (like let's say in Tetris). 

You could talk whether the problem really is the number games with positive or neutral protrayals or the sales they get or really even only the amount of respect they get. (look at how much some casual style games like Dance Central or Wii Fitness (=non bundled) got in sales and how little respect they get within the industry that is too busy fawning over the lastest high concept shooter) Aka are developers actually acting economically or are they being led by their own preferences in these things? Why is there even a distinction between casual and non-casual space and what does it mean anyway? No death penalty? No lose state? Playable in short bursts? Why do some games that don't fullfill those characteristics get lumped in with casual and some games that do fullfill these terms not get lumped with casual? Is casual just a code name for ""women"" or ""has frivolous cute stuff in it""? 

Or how about: what actually is the negative effect of bad portrayal? Is it guys getting the wrong impression about women? Is it women not connecting to the characters or women experiencing low self confidence? Is it people seeing the portrayal and being less likely to buy or respect a game because of it, preventing sales? Does it (and/or certain other topics) prevent gaming from having a higher standing in public perception? "

Gas-lighting is a form of mental abuse in which false information is presented with the intent of making a victim doubt his or her own memory, perception and sanity. Instances may range simply from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred, up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term ""gaslighting"" comes from the play Gas Light and its film adaptations.

Let's say you and your partner have the same phone, and you grab the wrong one. While that phone is in your possession a racy or suspicious text message arrives, which you read. Perhaps it says ""Ouch, why were you so rough with me? I'm sore today. ;)"" This suggest to you that your partner might be having an affair. 

Gas lighting would be to find a plausible explanation for that text, ""Oh, that's my good friend that I work out with."" Usually followed by shaming you for your suspicions or for your ""snooping"". Your partner may even feign  anger, demanding that you apologize for your suspicions or your actions. This makes you question your own thoughts, and over time your sanity.

A grown-ass 25 year old was almost crying in a LEGO store because I could buy a cup full of specialty pieces. 

It was magical. "

Of the whole beach, it was like maybe 80% white. The police were not stopping any white people for questioning, just blacks, mostly young people. 

You're right in that there's no excuse for this behaviour. Cops are just wankers. If there's a job opening for a position which will allow the successful applicant to bully everyone and get away with it, it's no surprise that bullies will be the ones applying for the job.

Fast forward now to my current committed relationship. My partner has done nothing to harm me or ruin my trust by the ex is makes me feel insecure, scared, betrayed, and makes it hard for me to trust people.

Even though I'm no longer with her the scars of what she did are still there. I can still have triggers and can still have severe trust issues when my partner is not with me.

Honestly, this is a personal journey for your husband but all you can do is reassure him every day. Every chance you get. That's all you can do. Be faithful (now) and just reassure him until the cows come home.

You'll never fix the damage you've done. My mother was cheated on by her first husband dozens of times and 33 years later she's still insecure with her current partner (who she's been with for roughly 16 years).

These things don't heal or go away but they just get a little easier. I was never fully at piece with my ex who cheated on me. I never could be but some days were good. Most times were better than others. Some days I just cried. It happens. Just reassure him"

Noodlemonkey, here's some actual advice. I'm a small animal veterinarian. Future employers will not care what veterinary school you graduated from. Individual schools care about your GPA, sure, but experience counts for more than grades. If you want to be a horse doc, then consider looking for a job as a veterinary assistant at an equine practice. Not only will you start making a little money, but you'll get a better idea of what it's really like to be in practice before you commit to four more years of school and &gt;$100,000 additional debt. Apply for income-based loan repayment in the meantime.

On a more personal note, ""You're smart, unlike most girls"" is a huge red flag. A man who respects women does not assume that most of them are idiots and/or poor conversationalists. You're going through a lot right now, and I can understand your frustration. Getting away from the internet for a bit might help you regain some perspective."

Plus they have to stay under the radar to avoid capture and return to their home country.  If everyone was able to bargain equally wages would likely be higher as employers wouldn't have a pool of illegal labor who won't ask too many questions and accept whatever wage they can get.  In industries with larger illegal labor pools this lowers wages for everyone.  Legal workers know they can be replaced with cheaper labor so they don't date ask for a higher wage themselves.  This plays right into the hands of employers who pocket the extra profit.  "

I listen to her motherfucking problems. And she values that. I pay into the relationship. When I have stupid motherfucking problems, she listens, and she pays in. We value each other for our actions, of which sex is one. Sex is great fun - it adds value to the relationship.

So Butters' argument is that paying directly for what you want is no different than paying indirectly. Absolutely right. However, what he's wrong about is Stan values other parts of his relationship with Wendy than kisses. The price he pays is, ideally, still lower than the value he receives."

AM:  

- splash face with water
- tone with witch hazel (generic grocery brand)
- apply [Skinceuticals Phyto+](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/phyto-plus.htm)
- moisturize with [Hawaiian Moon Aloe](http://www.aloecream.biz/product/4oz-skin-care-jar/) (here's a [list of ingredients,](http://www.aloecream.biz/ingredients/) I bought this at a marathon expo but it's worked really well!)
- apply [Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+sheer-+dry-touch+sunscreen+broad+spectrum+spf+70.do?sortby=ourPicks)

PM: 

- remove eye makeup with baby oil
- cleanse with [Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+gentle+daily+cleanser.do?sortby=ourPicks)
- exfoliate with [Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Power-Clear Scrub](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/oil-free+acne+stress+control-+power-clear+scrub.do?sortby=ourPicks)
- tone with witch hazel
- apply Phyto+
- moisturize with Hawaiian Moon Aloe ([Glo-therapeutics Renew Serum](http://www.gloprofessional.com/renew-serum) instead of the aloe 1-2x a week)

I really only *just* started this routine, overall re-vamped it about a month ago, and added in the witch hazel, phyto, and glo-therapeutics this week. I have been using the moisturizer for over a year. 

I have some PIH/redness on my cheeks, and have normal/acne-prone skin. However, I haven't had any active acne break-outs in quite a while. 

My main concern is - am I using everything in the correct order? I know moisturizer goes on last since it sort of sits on top of everything, but am I supposed to tone after I exfoliate?

Also, I'm a little unsure about the exfoliator I have... Should I try Stridex red pads instead? I was confused whether to get Neutrogena's Oil-Free or All-in-One Acne scrub, and I think I picked wrong :/"

travelingmama,changemyview,1390801253.0,"Tone of voice gets lost on the internet. I wasn't upset at all and I knew you were agreeing with me mostly. I learn a lot every time I do get into a debate about it so I really truly appreciate your questions and points. 

There really are no studies that I can find that prove that spanking in extreme circumstances is going to cause damage and I don't think there really ever could be one. When I was a young(er) mother, I thought it was the right thing to do and there were one or two times where I spanked my son for running in the street. To say I think I ruined his life with it, I'd be lying. If I'm going to be 100% honest, I live in Mormonville and have grown accustomed to the fact that when something isn't an absolute people will run with it. For example, alcohol and coffee is an ""absolute no"", but they actually believe that they should eat meat sparingly and avoid caffeine, but these aren't absolutes so they will eat as much meat and caffeine as they want and not feel a tinge of guilt. So I realize that I'm biased to believe that if someone has an exception to spanking that they will justify doing it in non extreme circumstances. That's my problem not anyone else's. You're right that it's a slippery slope argument so I'm glad you pointed that out because it made me reevaluate the way I argue. 

That said, and this is purely anecdotal so take it or leave it, I found that punishment with my son's personality just did. not. work. I could spank him a hundred times for running in the street and it would do nothing (he has ADHD so he's impulsive). When I stopped punishing and started using non-violent/non-punitive communication methods taught in the book called Parent Effectiveness Training I saw an immense improvement. Part of what makes this book really great is the fact that it explains the common mistakes parents make, why they don't work, and how proper communication really does work best and helps the child own their own problems and solve them. It's really common sense and things you learn in any college communication class (I've taken several), but it just lays out exactly how to do it properly and makes it really easy to understand. This is why I feel like there ARE more effective methods. It's a really fantastic read if you're interested. "

Spanking doesn't have to be immoral as long as the rule in their house is ""anyone can hit anyone"". But if the rule in the house is ""don't hit"" and the parent hits, that is immoral. 

I agree that those studies don't define spanking alone. It is only assumed that spanking is the most common form of physical punishment, so that does discredit the argument a bit. However, it is still a form of physical punishment therefore there is a possibility of it creating long term lasting effects. On the other hand abstaining from any form of physical punishment has no risks.  "

Woozl,DnD,1390802890.0,"Mr. Melvin Metagame memorized the Monster Manual. Alliteration aside, this guy really sucked both to DM for and to play with. Here I was trying to make a good story by occasionally fudging rolls to make combats easier/harder when appropriate, when Melvin would pop up and say, ""*Actually*, based off of our level, the damage these guys are doing, and their AC/Ref/Will/Fort, they're *this* specific monster, so really they have THIS many hit points and should be dead/alive."" This was usually followed by an audible eye roll from the rest of the party.

For the first several sessions, I just responded with a curt, ""Wrong"" with the hopes that he'd eventually catch on to what I was doing and stop metagaming so hard. Sadly, I think this only encouraged him to study the books MORE so he could be right, so he just did it more frequently. Eventually, I needed to talk to him privately and explain that not only does his character not have the Monster Manual memorized, but that his constant ""*Actually*""s were detracting from the campaign and that he needs to stop metagaming.

 It kinda worked, in the sense that he stopped doing it, but it didn't take him long after that to leave the campaign. He plays Warhammer now, and I think that's better for everyone."

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390802973.0,"&gt; I've always wondered why an oppresive government like that of Saudi Arabia's

Saudi arabia is only oppressive to certain groups of people.  They have a large favoured group of ethnic arabs who are citizens of Saudi arabia, and who are  men are not  oppressed.  Everyone else... not so much. 

But Saudi also recognizes the benefits of having a well educated subeset of the populace economically.  Oppression doesn't work when everyone is an illiterate peasant.  Having a mutitiered society works when one class is rich, educated and exploiting the lower class knowing full well that this is for the benefit of the upper class only, and the lower class doesn't know any better.  Citizens in Saudi (male citizens particularly) form the upper class.  Those are the ones you meet.  

You're not seeing the bangladeshi's, indians and pakistanis who are basically slave labourers working in Saudi - they're all, well, working.  And not on government subsidies.  

Women from important families can get education because their families are important.  

And keep in mind that if many of the people want 'freedom' away from the country that's fine too - if you get them to leave they don't stir up trouble back home.   The ones who want to go home do, the ones who don't have an education that will get them citizenship somewhere else, and suddenly they aren't your problem anymore.  

&gt;minds with heresies like freedom

Your conception of freedom is very biased.  I don't care where you are, or what you believe, everyone's perceptions of freedom are biased.

theJalden,BasicIncome,1390803002.0,"Beat me to the punch, I was going to post this.  I'll put my two cents on the article anyways.  I'm familiar with some of the JG platform, and I don't see it as appealing as the Basic Income.  Going piece by piece through his points:

&gt;So the goal is to reduce the supply of labor and reduce production.

1). The goal of a Basic Income isn't to reduce production.  I like production and so do most proponents of a BI.  But today production is being decoupled from labor, so it is less of an issue to consider.  And in my opinion it is worth whatever numbers drop so that people have more control over their lives.  By being freed from labor people can work on open source projects, community building, volunteer work, and child rearing.  It is production by another name, and just as constructive.

&gt;2) JG provides a “good job” alternative to people who work in “bad jobs”. When private employers want them back, they have to provide at least the same or better living wage-benefit package and work conditions offered in the JG.  JG sets the labor standard.  

2).  Being provided a ""good job"" is all talk.  There is a reason why unemployment is as high as it is now.  If there were ""good jobs"" to be had they would already be filled.  More than likely this ""good job"" would be a paper pushing sinecure, that does nothing but keeps a man from his family for 8 hours.

&gt;3). Under BIG, production drops, consumption rises, and so do prices. Suddenly, the value of the BIG grant has been eroded. Great success: the poor are still poor.

3).  Demand pull inflation is a bit of a hazard.  But if consumption rises, doesn't that mean there is more capital available to handle the production?  The ""suddenly there isn't as much space in the country club"" complaint doesn't mean things are getting worse. It means that things are becoming more like they should be.

&gt;4). Under JG, employment rises, socially useful production rises, and (as we have argued many times) some of that production is dedicated to the benefit of the poor

4).  Not much to say on this one but employment doesn't matter in a system that employs a basic income.  Things still may be rough on people who want a job but can't find one.  However, they have better means to start their own business.  Or they can improve their skills without worrying about basic survival.

&gt;5). Coupled with its countercyclical mechanism, JG is an inflation stabilizer

5).  Going to take your word on this one.  But basic income wouldn't devalue currency because the money to fund it comes from taxes.  The only inflation would come from increased demand.

&gt;6). BIG is not countercyclical. It’s universal, unconditional, but does not fluctuate with the business cycle. JG is a direct response to recessions and expansions.

6). This depends on how it is set up.  If, for instance a BI pays out a set amount from a reserve fund saved up from increased tax revenue in booms, then during busts it would supplement people's income more than it took away.  I'm not saying this is the way a BI would be set up, but it is a way.  So saying BIG is not counter cyclical, when it hasn't actually been implemented and tested, is a lie.

&gt;7). There is no mechanism by which BIG can ensure full employment over the short or long run. Only the JG can.

7).  No person advocating a basic income says it can ensure full employment.  See point #4

&gt;8). In short, BIG doesn't deal with price (or currency) stability, useful output, or any of the negative externalities from unemployment.

8).  Once again, it depends on the implementation.  Though this hardly counts as one of your ""reasons.""  It just sums up what has been said.

&gt;9). As Amartya Sen taught us, poverty is not just a function of lack of adequate income.  Providing income alone does not eliminate poverty.

9).  Maybe not, but it's a pretty damn intuitive place to start.  Giving everybody a basic support structure promotes the idea of institutional equality for starters.  So by that means it is better than other poverty programs.  I haven't read Amartya Sen, but it isn't just about having money.  It is about having a stable source of money, and using that to be able to reduce stress, plan ahead, and improve oneself.

&gt;10). The poor and the unemployed want to work.

10).  A basic income doesn't prevent people form working.  The system still encourages it.  It is why it is called a Basic Income, it provides solely for basic needs, everything on top of that is up to the individual.  You point to a paper you wrote yourself, and a broken link, and until I see a convincing statement that says the poor would definitely rather work than receive no income this ""reason"" has no strength.

&gt;11). There is almost a ‘neoclassical market equilibrating assumption’ behind most BIG analysis that says: “as long as people have cash, the market will magically provide the goods for them, allow them to acquire assets, provide them with the freedom to do what they please, etc. etc.”

11).  Generally people are able to exchange money for goods and services.  That is the basis for nearly every economic theory.  But you are right it is naive of us to assume that if people have money than they will also be able to acquire assets and would have more freedom than they would if they depended solely on their employer for income.  /s

&gt;12). Amartya Sen also taught us that what matters is not just freedom, but substantive freedom. 

12).  I don't know how to answer this.  I was under the impression that basic income did just that.

&gt;13). The JG does precisely that: recognizes many people want paid work, provides the job opportunity, and removes obstacles from taking the opportunity by targeting the jobs to the communities, and providing the very services that one might need in order to take care of these opportunities (education, transportation, care etc., etc.).

13).  It seems to me that a Basic Income would be a lot easier to manage while accomplishing nearly the same thing.  Instead of a central agency to decide who goes where market forces and individual preferences will drive the agenda.

&gt;14). BIG may lull the recipients into a false sense of security.

14).  A legitimate worry.  But at the same time it would be backed by the United States government, or whichever government in the respective country it is implemented.  A job might lull someone into a sense of security, until they get laid off.  My biggest worry is that a BI becomes a toll used by the government to control rather than liberate.

&gt;There is such a thing called ‘participation income’ and ‘civic minimum’ in serious scholarly work (Atkison 1995 and White 2003, respectively)—an idea that society is built on the principle of reciprocation. 

15).  Nobody wants to support a free loader, but what is the worse sin, that some people don't get what they need for basic survival, or that others don't return what is expected of them?  But, if nothing else, the free riders will be buying goods on the market, and contributing in that.

&gt;16). I find it ironic that we have to debate each other. BIG and JG stand on much the same principles.

16).  Infighting is bad, and there is a point where it becomes too much.  But the two ideas are fundamentally different.  There is little middle ground between the two.  Because of that people who feel strongly about one school of though will defend their own beliefs, and often times they do this by crafting a strong argument against an opposing idea.  Much like you have done, and like have have just finished doing.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390803703.0,"There are a couple of a approaches to compromising passwords.  

The first is a keylogger - basically a type of virus on your machine that is recording what you type and sending that to a server.  Keeping keyloggers off your machine by having a solid antivirus protects against this sort of thing.  Strong passwords don't help with this.  

The second form is a fairly elaborate system of trying to guess your password.  Sort of like the way you try and guess old passwords, but with millions or billions of attempts per second.  This is particularly problematic when say an encrypted form of your password gets stolen, because usually when that happens it hits a large number of accounts, and people tend to reuse passwords.

Remember what I said about elaborate?  So yes, as other people have described there are dictionary attacks, there are brute force attacks (where you literally try every valid combination) and there are attacks based on known passwords that  have been in use somewhere.  These sorts of attacks can tear through 70-80% of passwords in tiny fractions of a second, so you can compromise thousands or millions of passwords in an hour.  

When that happens really what you are trying to do is delay a hacker getting into your account, you cannot prevent it completely,  but the longer you delay, the more time there is to discover a breach, inform a user and have them change the password (to something hopefully unique and hard to guess, or at the very least different than the hacker has in their database).

 - we were going down the high way on our way home from a trip we tok to hocking hills where we smoked and tripped a good portion of the time and I'm laying in the back rolling up the rest of the weed we had in a massive blunt for when we get back home. No sooner do I finish rolling the blunt and lighting a joint he just calmly says tome that he just sped past a cop going 80 in a 65 and we need to get rid of or stash the weed. So I ended up taking a few large quick puffs of the joint and eat the remainder of it and stuffed the blunt in my rugby socks and pulled my jeans back down. I'm sweating bullets while the cop comes up and first thing he asks is if there is anything illegal in the car and my friends absent mindedly says yes the cop looks stunned and asked again and my friend luckily covered his ass. 

 - before my mom knew I was smoking I was grinding up some fresh bed and she started to open my door I quickly tossed my hand under my pants and acted like I was masterbating. Things were a tad awkward for the rest of the day

 - in high school my buddy brought some to school and word got out about it I ended up eating a quarter oz in a bathroom stall before the principal called my buddy and I along with 2 others into the office where a cop was waiting to search and seize any ""narcotics or paraphernalia""

 - In a state park me and a buddy were walking through the woods smoking come out and up to the trail to find a park ranger talking to a woman. We had just finished smoking our bowl and the guy walks up and asks us what we were up to and what the smell was. My buddies first response was that he shit himself and being the hard core idiot he was he then proceeds to shit his pants in front of this ranger.

Within specific types of handhelds:

* GBA -&gt; GBA SP: 7% price increase

* DS -&gt; DS Lite: 19% price decrease

* (PSP -&gt; 3000-model PSP: 40% price decrease)

So, that's three ""series"" where the price goes up a little with the upgraded, more advanced version, and two ""series"" where it goes *down* (by quite a bit)...

* PSP-3000 -&gt; PS Vita: 38% price increase (17% price decrease from base PSP)

1up-,AskReddit,1390806335.0,"In kindergarten, we had huge tires half buried in one part of the playground. Like they went from small tires to tractor tires, and you're supposed to jump on them or whatever. Well one of them was big enough to sit in with a friend, and you couldn't hear the rest of the playground and the kids yelling and stuff, which was nice if you just wanted to talk (whatever kindergarteners talked about).

So one recess, I was in there talking to my best friend Floyd, and we were flirting, because we were dating. Kindergarten dating, but damnit, it counts! So I remember thinking that recess had been a really long time, and I peaked my head out. There was no one out there. Recess was over, and I had no idea how long, but we were the only two kids out there. I freaked, because I didn't want the teacher to think I was skipping class (I was a real goody goody from a young age). So we run to the door and start banging on it because it's locked, a teacher comes out all worried. I'm bawling, inconsolable, I thought I was going to get detention and my parents would be called, etc (the entire school knew I was a good kid though, so obviously that wouldn't happen). The teacher just sent us to our classes, but not before having to calm me down.

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1390806347.0,"This may be a case of your type being the sort that prefers the chase more often than not. In general I've found those types (through the recollections of others, I've been used as a therapist or social skills/relationship coach by a lot of people, and my own interactions and observations, the wonder of trying to generalize human behavior is that you end up needing to take a look at sexuality and courtship from all angles) tend to have other common flaws which make relationships with them unstable. It isn't a tautology but it's true enough that girls would be better off simply showing interest and thus weeding out the ones that need the chase, one cannot be pursued forever nor can one always be giving chase but to seek and in turn be sought, that can last an eternity. As I said it is often a matter of maturity. You're 25 and likely have been relying upon being passive for a few years, that means that you were actively denying the guys who want more than a hunt when the balance tipped in their favor, they are the ones who you are most likely to stay with if only because they can stop chasing (or at least pull back as it never hurts to make the dating period last as long as the relationship even if the relationship is to last until death)."
bulborb,dogs,1390806366.0,"I'm not arguing against body language in general. I'm saying that if you think you're going to be ""bigger and badder"" to your dog with some Millan-endorsed intimidation efforts, you're just going to end up with a confused and scared dog. So thanks for the speech and all, but maybe instead of focusing on one sentence you should take the post for what it is. Your dog doesn't think you're an alpha, he thinks you're his human master -- you don't need dominance to do that. Consistency, training, and giving him food will establish that role. We are not part of their ranking order, we are an entirely separate entity to them. If you believe that you hold a contestable position, you're admitting that you *do* think that your dog views you as another dog. The bottom line is that your ""dominant"" body language is far from what he is able to understand thoroughly, and attempting to imitate dog behavior will only confuse them. The first article I linked talks quite a bit about that. There's no use in preaching something that has been disproved, especially if you're recommending the intimidation of an already aggressive dog."

Finished my masters end of 2012 just as the mining industry was dumping jobs all over the place and shelving projects. Got sent to these job network merkins and they ask me what sort of work I'm looking for. ""Erm.. geophysical exploration work?"" I got a blank look and a 'What is geophysics?' reply, then later they suggested I look at forklift jobs or 'go to tafe and get a certificate to improve my attractiveness to employers' and gave me handy tips like 'dont chew gum and wear jeans to job interviews'.

I can see their use in helping young people or people without any training/skills/experience who don't know how to interview or present themselves for jobs, but if you're educated, experienced and just in between jobs rather than never had one in your life, and you're looking for something above minimum wage/unskilled labor, then they are basically useless. (but still make you jump through all the same stupid hoops anyway).

I was researching my ass off and applying for all kinds of jobs in my field and related fields all over Australia and overseas, and it was a total waste of time/money/effort having to take time out from that to attend these useless 'meetings' with job network people.

2. Google is your friend. Don't feel like you need to start with ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" #1(1963) and keep reading till you reach the modern day. If you want to know ""x"" character's backstory: Google it; read the wiki entry; etc. A lot of those older stories are nigh-unreadable to a modern reader's sensibilities and are usually not reflective of what the modern books are like.

3. If you don't enjoy a series after a few issues: stop reading it and check out a different book. It doesn't matter if the story is a classic. It doesn't matter if the author is highly regarded. It doesn't matter if the book sells a lot of copies. If you don't enjoy it, don't read it. You aren't ""doing it wrong"", you just enjoy different things.

4. Figure out what authors/artists you like/dislike. Follow your favorite authors/artists to books about characters you don't know anything about: you might find a nice surprise.

Men and women are not as different as most would assume, we all want to be wanted, to be needed, to be loved, to belong. If you enjoy having somebody show interest then why wouldn't men enjoy the same. As should be clear from this thread men do not like the chase (at least not unless they are being chased as well) and thus prefer somebody who is genuine with them. If we were to use your assumption (men will lose interest if they are given attention) then your conclusion (feigning disinterest improves the odds of a relationship) would be correct but as your assumption is false your conclusion does not hold with reality."
AKA_Sotof,Denmark,1390807117.0,"Richard Dawkins er en fundamentalist? Hold dog op hvor er det latterligt at høre på. Det eneste manden er fortaler for er at du sætter videnskaben højere på dagsordnen end du gør en fjollet mytologi. 

&gt;Alle religiøse er undermennesker

Der er en stor forskel mellem at udfordre religiøse menneskers holdninger og at kalde dem for undermennesker. 

&gt;alle der tror på en gud fortjener ikke hans respekt.

De mister da også klart respekt i mine øjne. Det jo tåbeligt at tro på en gud. Respekt er også noget du gør dig fortjent til og ikke noget du har krav på.

I sidste ende har dette nu ikke noget at gøre med det jeg skrev. Du prøver såmænd blot at distrahere fra det sørgelige faktum at mange fundamentalister er religiøse og de fleste værdier som opgør deres fundament er særdeles barbariske og umenneskelige."

* Goalkeeper is the only position American players have ever succeeded in in foreign leagues.

* MLS will be a top tier league in the next 10 years (just look at how far it's come in the last 10).

* The United States will never become a world power by scraping the bottom of the barrel for half-bloods (i.e. Jones)

* Mexican and South American football is a complete shit show. Everything from the jersey sponsors to the corruptness to the actions of the players is despicable. **Liga MX is in no way better than MLS**, CONCACAF Champions League results be damned.

* Manchester United (even during Fergie's reign) is the most boring team in England.

* Any tackle from a goalkeeper that results in a penalty is punishment enough in itself.  Goalkeepers should not be included in the last man back/ denying obvious goal scoring opportunity red card offense because that is their natural position and they are there 100% of the time either way.

*There is a reason for that.* It amounts to expensive, uncertain, medical torture. I mean. The shit you have to inject into yourself to produce the eggs to harvest; the hormonal roller coaster that results; the painful extraction; the storage and dealing with the fact that you have a finite number of priceless embryos left on ice; attempting implantation in her or a surrogate (more delightful, sterile, medical pain); the very real likelihood of either complete failure or *multiple pregnancies* and then you get to have a discussion about *selective reduction* of those multiples, which can result in losing *all* of them. It's a perilous and all-consuming process that -- given she could likely conceive naturally -- it's frankly ridiculous you would consider. Speak to couples who have done IVF or had to store their eggs due to medical treatments, and ask them their unvarnished opinion of the experience. Maybe ask them to compare its level of difficulty and emotional trial with, oh, *taking a fucking baby on vacation.*

The act of creating new life with someone you love can be one of the most sexy, warm, and intimate things you ever do. It can be a truly unique and precious experience. But instead, you are *barely considering to deign* to give her the possibility of children in a laboratory setting with injections, dilators, and bright hospital lights.

SilentLettersSuck,Fitness,1390808225.0,"Why can't you run those three days? not enough time? Work? I found that short days stuck in between my long runs really helped add some miles in. Those three days off don't need to be 8mile runs, but a quick 30-35minutes 3/4/3 would add ten miles to your weekly total and eventually you could progress to 5/5/5. Or you could do some lifting and stretching to really build a solid base and work around weaknesses. Do you run with a duckbutt and gut sticking out? Knee/hip/back pains? There are many minor things that can be fixed about running other than your speed and total. A lot of runners would benefit from building a stronger back/core (pushups, pullups, planks and deadlifts) and a more flexible lower half. Considering you had an injury, there should be something that can be fixed.

There are many schools of thought in running and you need to know what works best for you. Some prefer to go long,short,long, repeat with a extra long day. Others prefer to do some speed work on short days. I think they are all important. Personally I was doing this a few weeks before the marathon before I started to taper off:

* Sunday: 22miles
* Monday: Rest
* Tuesday: 10miles
* Wednesday: 5miles
* Thursday: 15miles
* Friday: 8miles
* Saturday: 10miles

Some of those short days were switched with speed/hill work earlier on when I was training at about 45-50 miles/week. I spent some days at the track timing myself on intervals doing 400m 800m and 1mile repeats, but closer to the actual race I wanted to focus on weekly miles (60-70) more and prevent injuries so I made them slow recovery runs."

This is a mild case, but I feel as though when people think of autism they jump to those who are severely disabled and in a wheelchair who are generally incapable of learning much of anything but from my experience, they were the minority. These programs are beneficial, and due to those programs she is paying tax dollars (as well as taking them in) and working to live on her own.

* required field validation (value technique)
* positioning issues (layer technique)
* not clearing the placeholder when value is set programmatically (bypassing focus/blur)
* restoring the placeholder when cleared programmatically
* applying styles consistently between IE and browsers that natively support placeholders

I just switched to yet another polyfill recently and so far nobody has reported any significant issues, but I remain unsettled after going through so many so far.  Thanks again, Microsoft.

So to make sure they are being honest in that they like me I start interpretting everything they do, looking for possible flaws in their logic that they really do like me. And then I'm like ""oh god, they just said they have to leave to go to sleep, they like sleep more than me, they're going to leave me"" for a millisecond and then rationality hits me and I realize I'm just overinterpreting 'cause I hate putting myself out there to be hurt but you have to make yourself vulnerable to your SO eventually to get the most out of the relationship and that scares the shit out of me.

I rarely care what random people think of me so I don't do much interpreting much less misinterpreting their views on me.

If I placed short term pleasure above long term happiness then I would advise playing games and getting as much play out of it as you could but those relationships are often doomed to failure (most guys looking for a relationship will look for somebody who is able to be real with them, many lack the patience to put up with games for long and more are realizing that they have enough power to refuse to play into other's games) and you seem to want something lasting. People enjoy being around those who are truly happy (or good enough at faking it that it seems to be real), very few people can pretend to be another and be happy. People dislike being lied to, putting on an act is inherently lying. I could go on but essentially one must consider the pros and cons of putting on an act, in your case putting on an act is more negative than not in the long term but those negatives are harder to see in the short term (if you're lucky than you won't run into them). At the very least I have learned enough to emulate others so flawlessly that I outperform most socially when such things are instinctual for them, then again that means I have contemplated other possible courses in order to select the best.

Adjusted for inflation (and looking only at the cheapest bundles/editions available at launch):

* 1985: NES - $433.01 ($200 in '85); two controllers, one game, no zapper

* 1986: Atari 7800 - $297.57 ($140 in '86); appears to have included one controller, no games (?)

* 1989: Sega Genesis - $375.74 ($200 in '89); included one controller, one game

* 1991: SNES - $359.18 ($210 in '91); included one controller, one game

* 1994: Sega Saturn - $627.19 ($399 in '94); included one controller, presumably one game

* 1994: Sony Playstation - $470.00 ($299 in '94); included one controller, no games (IIRC), no memory card

* 1996: N64 - $295.46 ($199 in '96); included one controller, no games (IIRC), no rumble paks

* 1999: Dreamcast - $279.66 ($200 in '99); included one controller, no idea regarding games or memory cards

* 2000: PS2 - $404.50 ($299 in '00); included one controller, no games, no memory cards, no network adapter, eyetoy, etc.

* 2001: Gamecube - $263.08 ($200 in '01); included one controller, no games, no idea re: memory cards

* 2002: Xbox - $388.48 ($300 in '02); included one controller, no games IIRC

* 2005: Xbox 360 - $356.65 ($299 in '05); included one controller (wired, in a generation with wireless as standard), no games, no hard drive, no component cable, no wireless adapter, no headset, no kinect

* 2006: PS3 - $576.61 ($499 in '06); included one controller, no games, no Eye, no component/HDMI cables

* 2006: Wii - $288.87 ($249.99 in '06); included one remote+nunchuk, one game, no ethernet adapter

* 2012: Wii U - $304.38 ($299.99 in '12); included one controller, no wiimotes, no games

* 2013: PS4 - $399 ($399 in '13); included one controller, no games, no camera

* 2013: Xbox One - $499 ($499 in '13); included one controller, no games, kinect

That's pretty much up and down across the board. The Xbox One is one of the spendier consoles, but if you include the price of a Kinect ($160.25, adjusted from $150 in 2010), you'd've been paying $517 for a 360. The original Playstation was nearly as expensive, and that didn't even include what you needed in order to save games, I don't think. So was the NES. The Wii U, released just two years ago, was one of the **cheapest** major consoles (second to the Atari 7800, the N64, the Dreamcast, Gamecube, and the Wii - but cheaper than the NES, the Genesis, the Saturn, any Playstation, and any XBox).

And to compare some game prices, too:

* NES: $64.95 to $108.25 ($30 to $50 in 1985)

* Genesis: $93.93 ($50 in 1989)

* SNES: $85.52 to $102.62 ($50 to $60 in 1991)

* PS1: $62.88 ($40 in 1994)

We used to have this wonderful little chinese restaurant in the town I grew up in, little place but they made the best food.

They had amazing Cantonese style chow mein

wonderful Egg Foo Young.

And just this incredible fried rice. And they used like dark soy in it and it had this rich, mahogany color[ like this](http://www.devilslastsupper.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/CIMG0277.JPG) and it tasted incredible.

postExistence,self,1390810546.0,"My story: I'm 25 and at a pub down the road. Lots of young people in their mid-twenties or older people with husbands/wives. These two women walk in who are about in their mid-thirties, and a friend from my group - who is sufficiently drunk - decides to take photographs of these two women (perhaps as a conversation starter?) with his slick DLSR camera.

So the cameraman and another friend in our group chat these two women up, and the women subsequently leave for a smoking break. I, being moderately sober iirc, get the courage to have a chat with them. What can I say?

Well, in addition to remarking about how strange it was that my friend enjoyed taking pictures of them, the conversation somehow got to our modes of transportation. I was about to mention what I drove when one of the women says, ""What? On your bicycle?"" I looked at her, a bit confused. ""Excuse me?"" I responded. And she continued, ""What are you, like fifteen?""

That was the end of the conversation. It was only fifteen minutes after I got back to my group that I realized a perfect retort: ""I'm twenty-five, and you wish you looked this young when you were my age!"" ~Alas~

So back to your story, OP, I'm thinking about the 22-year-old lawyer. I think most women in their twenties are especially picky about men because they just get out of college and want to begin their careers. It would take a really awesome guy for them to derail this plan, so their standards are incredibly high because anything else just wouldn't be worth it.

I think you have a good handle on how you look. You look young for your age, you're skinny, and you have a somewhat feminine look about you (not in any extreme or bad way, it's just something I'm noting). All of this is why some people might describe you as ""cute"" over a word like ""handsome."" You'll probably progress towards that ""handsome"" look as you age.

PacDan,AskMen,1390811275.0,"Did she outright lie to you? I think she may not place as big an importance on sex compared to you. Her ""nothing serious"" might be emotionally rather than physically. In which case you can't fault her there.

In terms of you feeling worthless, that's a red flag for me for multiple reasons. For one, your self of self-worth is being derived from how many partners your girlfriend had before you. If it matters to you that much (which I don't think it should, but you can't help it if it does) then I think that's the major problem here, not that she didn't tell you.

You seem to be going through some self-esteem issues which is totally normal. The therapist your pastor recommended may be a good idea for no reason other than that. 

I understand you not liking her attitude, but if I were to place myself in her shoes I would feel angry and insulted. 

She is with you for a reason though. Something about you makes her think you're more worthy of a relationship than her friends-with-benefits. That speaks really highly of you! Also in terms of feeling inadequate sexually, that can always be worked on, talk to her about it. 

My advice for you would be to understand her past shouldn't matter in terms of where you are right now. If you two are happy together there's no issue. 

I understand your concern for her ""settling"" for you compared to these super-attractive guys. But maybe they were immature or just didn't work out for her. Just because you're not super athletic or in shape doesn't mean you don't have other things to offer.

Just keep your head up and understand her past doesn't change who she is now and that she is with you for a reason."

JAWJAWBINX,casualiama,1390811369.0,"I was and wasn't. I was able to learn to pass rather quickly, enough that by the time I was in first grade I seemed a bit different but only if you were looking for it. Then I was diagnosed, that meant that my school put me in therapy (the school was affiliated with a local college so we got help from them, that meant the school had highly trained therapists and among them an ABA specialist) which was essentially just abuse, I tried harder to learn to pass because I thought that they'd stop (it was supposed to help me, if I didn't seem different then obviously I wouldn't need help). I was better socially than all of my peers and most of the people a grade or two above me by the middle of 1st grade. I had an older brother who was about as popular as a kid could be at our school, people knew that messing with me essentially meant messing with the rest of the school and that protection spread through me to others, not that it was needed. Eventually some bullies transferred in and others became bullies, they were social pariahs because of it and their attempts at bullying got them worse treatment than they could dish out (they were smart enough to avoid physical stuff and to avoid targeting anybody associated with me in anyway). Eventually my best friend joined them for a time (all of 4th grade, in a way I think it may have saved my life) and nobody really knew what to do since I wouldn't let anybody respond to him, he was back to normal by the end of the year. The school system was good, it was inclusive enough that even in high school there weren't really bullies or cliques, I was still a key social figure (if people needed help with something socially I was the person to ask for advice, same if you had a problem you needed to talk about). The other students weren't a problem but I still had shit to deal with, I could have easily turned to hating everybody but I internalized it and hated myself, only reasonable since I was told over and over that my abusers were helping me and that I needed it. I coped by walling most of myself off, all the pain and anger, my empathy and senses, part of me decided it was better hidden away so it was. It all came back about a year ago, as much as it hurts I'm glad that I'm whole again or at least as whole as I can be.

I was sociable but I preferred to be alone, it's easier to put on an act when the scene is static. With people I'd need to adjust to them and what they did, I'd need to control the situation and expend so much more energy than if I were alone. The problem was that if I was alone then I'd need to keep my mind constantly occupied lest it wander on its own, I still need to do that as it still wanders to the same dark places.

College has been ok, there are always problems but for the most part I can't really complain. My roommate and I have some issues, normal roommate issues and his attitude in general (he's rather pessimistic, it makes it harder to do things and hang out with people since he hates everybody) but it's manageable. I do have the advantage of going to school near my parents house, it's actually closer to most of my classes than my dorm so I'll go there when I have breaks to have lunch for free and a clean bathroom. I'm going to be in on campus apartments next year (four people to a suite and we have three with a possible fourth who'll probably be living in the same building with some mutual friends if not with us).

If you want to see a change in your brother then you'll need to change the way he sees the world, the problem is that we are constantly bombarded with clear signs that we don't belong and far too often we see that we are reviled by others, it's easier to assume others are evil and deserving of our hate than assume that the horrors of the world are unintentional. He was treated like shit for who he was, it wasn't simply that his peers and teachers (as it's always clear when things like that are going on) rejected him but that they rejected his worth and humanity. He had to fight his world, when you stop fighting you're forced to notice your wounds and come to terms with what you did, it hurts less to fight forever than it does to stop. He has his reasons for the way he acts and unless you can learn to understand him then you won't have a hope of helping him to understand the world, in a way that may be for the best as the truth is far more horrifying.

/r/aspergers may be of more use for understanding your brother than /r/autism, /r/aspergers is mostly people in the spectrum while /r/autism is mostly parents. Both will be useful but in different ways."

* The Issue At Hand - 10 of pentacles
* Crossed By - 2 of swords
* Base of the Issue - XIII Death
* Crown of the Issue - 7 of cups
* Past - 8 of cups
* Future - XI Justice

* How I See Myself - 3 of swords
* How Others See Me - XVII The Star
* Hopes and Fears - 7 of rods
* The Outcome - XV The Devil

This was a reading for myself and I asked ""What do I need to know?"" The Knight of Cups turned face up while I shuffled. 

Interpretation:

The Knight from my shuffling is clearly referring to a new love interest that has recently entered my life - that card has recently come up to signify him before. 

The 8s of cups and pentacles refer to my decision to step away from love for a time after a breakup in September and focus on my career. Death is here because this is a time full of change in my life. The 7 of cups are all my hopes and dreams - I'm rediscovering myself in singlehood and prioritizing my own desires rather than shared desires. The 2 of swords confuses me - I think it may refer to how I feel I'm going into this whole thing blind since I have no way to know how my life will go, but I have to trust my gut moving forward. Justice implies that this decision is a fair one, that I will achieve what is due to me as a result. 

The 3 of swords can be a few things - I feel a bit disappointed for choosing to choose power over love, or the swords each represent a lover that has a claim to my heart (my ex, the new knight of cups, and another person I've casually been dating). Others see me as the Star - well on my journey of self-discovery, someone who is seeking enlightenment of a sort and on the right path. The 7 of rods represents my fear that my decision, my beliefs may come under attack - I hope to be in the right place to defend my ground. And the Outcome of the Devil confuses me too - I've never been good at interpreting this card in general and can only guess that my insecurities will get in the way of forging new romantic relationships for a time or that I ought of exercise caution in these relationships. 

All suggestions are welcome, feel free to ask clarifying questions if need be. I use the Morgan-Greer deck. "

PacDan,AskMen,1390814091.0,"If you feel she lied by omission (like you said, if she knew what you were asking but answered the exact question you asked), then that's definitely a problem. 

I don't know what my advice would be about overcoming your feelings about how many men she has been with. But, how would you feel if her opinion of you changed because you had sex with your past girlfriend? Growing up in a Christian background myself I know it can be hard to see past the ""girls must be pure and serve their husbands"" thing (if you are wanting to look past that, some men and women are perfectly happy with that dynamic and that's fine). 

I understand what you mean about not wanting to get broadsided with this information. I'd still like to bring up that she *may* not have thought this was a big deal.

&gt; I won't lie, I now question whether or not she's had sex with him from other things that I have now thought about in retrospect.

Do you mean during your relationship, or just some time in the past?

&gt; She laughed at me when I brought this up as an issue to her and told me I was being silly.

I didn't get that from the wording of your first post, sorry. If you spoke to her like it was a big deal and she just laughed you off that isn't okay. I feel she should be willing to talk about things, even if she doesn't think they are a big deal because they're a big deal to you.

&gt; Also while I know people are trying to help me with the she must think you are special to be with you bit, I can't help but wonder if maybe they just got tired of her and dumped her. So she ended up with me.


This sounds like you are trying to find reasons for her to have settled for you. I think if you want to stay with her you should definitely try to talk to her (probably not mention the fact you think she settled) and try to figure out why she is with you.


My first reply to you was a little accusatory and I worded some things poorly, sorry. I hope you find yourself in a better place soon. "

Simple answer: circumcision is very common in the US, so women from the US are more used to it, and are probably more likely to prefer cut. Outside the US: (ie. the *normal* part of the world), circumcision is very uncommon, so non-American women probably prefer uncut.

That said, it still comes down to personal preference. I am Australian, and all the girls I have been with have never seen a circumcised penis. But, I was on OKCupid and looking at an Aussie chick's profile, and all was good until the very bottom where under 'message me if' she had ""only if circumcised"". Very unusual here.."

Fradkov,sweden,1390814777.0,"Cannabis har lett mig till både positiva och negativa beslut, när jag var yngre så stoppade jag i mig en jävla massa skitmat och gjorde inte särskilt mycket mer än att sitta hemma och glo tecknade serier. Vilket i och med för sig var jävligt nice medans det varade.

Men nu har det också lett mig till att sluta röka tobak, gå ut och röra på mig och skulle aldrig falla mig in att jogga utan en joint innan jag drar på mig skorna. Jag har börjat träna på utegym och gått ner 30 kilo, ingenting jag hade kunnat göra utan gräs.

I övrigt så har det dämpat min ångest, lett mig ut att träffa fler människor och jag mår allmänt bättre av det. Det gäller att ha koll på hur man brukar, när man brukar och framför allt vilka man brukar med. Det sämsta som hänt mig på grund av mitt cannabisbruk är att jag behövde betala 5000 kronor till Polisen.


Jag vill inte översälja Cannabisbruk, det är precis som alla andra berusningsmedel någonting man ska vara försiktig med, men jag vet att olagligt eller ej så tänker jag prata med mina framtida ungar om hur man brukar det ansvarsfullt istället för att förbjuda det."

tangonovember,AskMen,1390815126.0,"My fiancee sounds a bit like you, actually. Not the same family situation really, but she too was worried about how I would perceive her family when we started dating. She still worries anytime I see them that they'll scare me off (kind of late for that now...)

To give you some background, she's from the rural Midwest (very conservative Christian family). Her father, while a well-meaning man, is terrible with finances and has a gambling problem and managed to gamble away her college fund (luckily, she still got to go to a great college with merit-based scholarships and some loans). Her mother has a very advanced nervous system disease, so my fiancee basically took care of the rest of the family for most of her life. She and her family are still loving, but do not get along very well.

As a contrast, I'm from a very wealthy family (which cares a great deal about manners and being 'proper,' so she's terrified at family affairs that she'll do something wrong) from liberal Silicon Valley, and I was raised Jewish. Perfect match, right?

I can't speak for your boyfriend, but I can give you my own feelings about my relationship. I'll admit that, looking back on ex-girlfriends past, I do miss the 'bonus family' aspect from those relationships. I built some great bonds, both with moms and dads, and I do miss that in my current relationship.

But even when I had a great time with the family of a girlfriend...I wasn't dating the family. I was dating the girl. And really, that's the far more important part of this equation - how he and you get along. Families can be as large or as small a part of your relationship as you two want them to be.

Moreover, I have incredible respect for my fiancee and what she's accomplished without a very strong family support structure (and with having to take care of them for so many years as a child). I suspect that your boyfriend will have the same admiration for how you've come through your own trials and tribulations here. Having a less-than-perfect family history by no means makes you 'broken' or amoral or anything like that - it proves how resilient and self-motivated you are.

I wouldn't hide your family history from him, personally. It's certainly going to come out at some point if you keep dating, and you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of here. I have a feeling he won't think any differently of you after you share this - or if he does, he'll just respect you that much more."

sworebytheprecious,news,1390819070.0," just the other night i fucked my boyfriend senseless and i made a terrible mistake: i turned on xfinity and tried to watch pawn stars, not expecting the terrible horror comcast had in store for me. it was laughably bad and obtuse beyond reason. i had flashbacks from windows 95 and the dreaded IBM days of yore: blue screens, red buttons, delays... my god, so many useless buttons. it was if a television service had designed a device for me with the the sole fucking purpose of PREVENTING me from watching television. see? ACCESS! it wasn't that cable was hard to use: *it was mean, too!* cable is now a mean thing and, like an angry dog bloody and injured after a fight, it's cornered and lashing out at everyone it can. but the internet is meaner and it's not injured: it's pretty smart and technology has been very kind to old dogs who bite. it doesn't like to have them suffer, it puts them down.


so i gave up on xfinity, settled with the fact comcast will only have seattle under it's evil monopoly until google gets here, and i hooked the HDMI port from my tablet to the television. and i streamed that shit from... well, never mind where, the fact is i got it playing.


netflix is going through the same thing cable did back in the day: tighter regulations, higher fees, more content, bloated content, and hollywood pushback. i might be dating myself but i talked to my grandparents to check my facts on the 80s. this is a brief history of cable and netflix.


in the 80's and early 90s, cable was a BIG FUCKING DEAL. remember that simpsons episode where lisa basically worried for her families immortal souls over homer stealing cable? for the big fight? it baffled me in 1994, until my grandma explained that there was a time when cable was a real luxury, in the early eighties, and when no one had it but everyone wanted it for fights and exclusive movie channels. i suspect the reason that particular simpsons episode isn't on anyone's top ten lists because it was already dated when it came out, but i digress: there was once a time when a cable meant a few high-quality, in demand shows and channels and everyone loved it. to a certain extent they still do, but by and large cable has lost it's allure. that's an understatement.


as new tech happens to do, cable came under tight content regulations, bloat, and higher prices than their eventually lowered quality would allow, much like netflix is encountering today (actually the internet and netflix has been quite resilient compared to cable in the 80s and 90s). it's especially challenging for netflix because they're fighting a war on two fronts: they are getting the ISP pushback but they are also getting pushback from hollywood as they cannibalize DVD sales, just like old cable and even VHS sales did back in the day. for some comparison, in the late 90s, the head of the MPAA Jack Valenti compared VHS sale movie impacts to the rapist Boston Strangler. that wouldn't fly now but think back a few years when youtube was the great satan hollywood claimed would destroy them, and you get the picture: hollywood thinks it's always a victim, even when new tech eventually helps them profit.


the second problem, channel and content bloat, was a problem growing from early cable but really got bad in the early nineties with specialized TV channels such as MTV, VH1, USA, and the like. it's hard to fill one channel with good content 24/7, but try multiple channels with not as much tv content or ideas as we have for cable today (thanks 24 hour news!) and you have bloat, bloat, bloat. back in the 80s and 90s they let you know about it all too, and they made money from it. via TV GUIDE, a published channel booklet, but now the problem of bad content is solved instantly via searches so you don't even need to read long, let alone buy a magazine, to know paying 84.99 for eight hours of Speed and The Dog Whisperer repeated ad naseum is a bad idea repeated along forty channels. but netflix came under this curse too: go on your netflix recommendation list and see what's really there, all the low quality: it's mostly reality and bad b movies from the 90s with quite a few 90s and 80s rom coms, with a few indie movies and block busters from last year that were cheap to pick up. and now, netflix is bloated too. so, like the cable channels before them, they are losing customers. and they too will have to raise prices to make this up and provide more premium content to survive. 


netflix will not survive at all if it keeps following cable's model. the internet changed everything and nothing in entertainment at the same time. all my other observations really come down to the 70s and 80s trope of the old guard fretting about some new fangled technology. this new battle is really about an older story though, and it's dates all the way back to when *hollywood was piracy.* back in early 1900s hollywood was founded by movie makers who wanted to get away from thomas edison's control of the film and his brutal copyright controls. at first glance the two stories may look alike, but what the 70s and 80s cable battles missed was that startlingly new frontier. the internet is that new land, at least to the isp, cable, and old hollywood if not to the users. the baby boomer cable battle was all about money but this about access.



netflix needs to keep doing it's own thing and stop thinking they can win by following hollywood or cable. i believe hollywood may survive this battle because it's fought it before, but traditional cable is surely the loser in the viewer battle. netflix shows some hope because it's providing some great content to rival cable's badly held hold on the american public, but it needs to stop thinking it can make cable or hollywood it's allies before i pay more. because i don't want to give hollywood or cable any more of my money. they're darkly predictable, hostile to new content makers, and insultingly shallow, so i don't think they like me very much. and i don't like them anymore and i want something new.


hopefully netflix won't be something brief so brief. i don't know if i can go back to blue screens and remotes.

carnageincminor,MakeupAddiction,1390819587.0,"**Eyeliner:**

Just so I understand correctly, are you using liquid liner on your bottom waterline (the bit of skin inside the lash line, touching the eyeball)? If so, this is generally not recommended because it runs/smudges very easily and can be painful when the liquid gets in contact with the eye. Is this what you're experiencing?

I would say first off that it's not essential to put liner on the bottom waterline. I know it gets touted around all the time as the makeup 'to do', and it's what I was told when I was younger, but it's not always a flattering look for everyone, it tends to give a very intense/dramatic eye look, and also some people find it uncomfortable because the waterline is sensitive.

If you want to keep lining the waterline, I would suggest a pencil or cream eyeliner which is safer on the eyes and less smudgy. You can also opt for brown instead of black, which gives a subtler, more natural effect.

Alternatively, my preferred method of lining the bottom eyelid (if you do it at all, because it's not essential for every look) is something [like this](http://shelookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/top-and-bottom-lidsblack-eyeliner-gray-water.jpg) where you keep it as close to the actual lash line as possible, with the line thicker on the outer corner and thinner towards the middle.

For lining the top lashes, [this tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1la30n/as_requested_heres_a_tutorial_about_how_i/) might help with getting in between the lashes.

**Eyeshadow:**

For your eye shape, I would avoid using light/shimmery shades on the browbone as that will emphasise them. To bring your deep set eyes forward, use light/shimmery shades on your lid. Your crease colour also doesn't need to be too deep as you already have the natural shadow effect, but you can try bringing the crease colour above your actual crease, almost into the browbone area, to soften the 'protrusion' of your browbone. (/u/LetOutTheBeast posted that picture which illustrates this point.)

You might also want to look into Expeditions Conquistadors where you also manage a small group of troops, travel around with them, and make storyline/quest decisions. More focus on the combat though I would say, but you can tell the creator really tried to give flavor to the storyline and give you room to build a character for your main. Can't really say whether it is more involved than in Banner Saga. 

If you enjoy the whole ""raising your army"" aspect, other games that have that are X-Com and Blood Bowl (not as much in the storyline decisions though). 

Newers versions of the oregon trail type of gameplay (where you traverse some ground and have to deal with rations) are Organ Trail and Super Amazing Wagon adventure.

&gt; If you're obese, you're using more fabric. Do you know boys clothes are cheaper than girls clothes? Seriously, same amount of fabric, thats not fair. Complaining because clothing that fits uses 20%+ more fabric doesnt hold up.

Moreover, men's clothing are often designed to me practical, while women's are designed to be pretty. I end up wearing up to 5 layers of clothing in winter (not including my jacket), because I work outside and finding clothes that fit *and* are practical is damn near impossible.



&gt; &gt; You’re not the brunt of jokes for countless numbers of comedians.

&gt; Yes, b/c they're the only target for jokes.

Unlike women, men, foreigners, locals, sex, sexual tendencies, sexual orientation, religion (or non)... comedians make fun of everybody, as a whole. I think I've watched more comedians poke fun at themselves/their sex lives than anything else.



&gt; &gt; Your body type isn’t sexually fetishized.

&gt; I'm sure somewhere there is porn for it. 

And... okay, this is a weird one for me. They *want* to be sexually fetishized? Granted, I'm an average-sized woman myself, but the closest I've ever come to feeling that way is when somebody makes the ""I love redheads"" leering comment. A) I dye it red, and B) it's fucking creepy. /r/sex and /r/OKCupid often have Asian girls posting about how frustrating it is to date because they're fetishized for their nationality.

Du får det att låta lite som att jag påstår att transfobi inte finns, eller att homofobi inte är ett problem. Då missförstår du mig helt. Att man inte kan kanske är fel ord, men att få till en absolut utopi är nog bara en fantasi.

atheistium,ffxiv,1390821636.0,"&gt;I understand where you are coming from, but you also must realize that if only 10 people out of 100 don't have any problems with ps3s, there is still a problem.

Just because you're mainly seeing complaining doesn't mean everyone has the issue mind. 

I think we can both agree a lot of people struggling with plumes in Titan HM/EM because they just need practice. I don't think it's unfair to rule out a huge amount of people complaining of lag etc with this stuff. I used to be one of those people. Lots don't want to admit they are just not very good at missing plumes. 

Also none of those problems you seem to be having I've experienced on PS3 - so I can't say it's a console issue because I'm not experiencing them on PS3. If it was a version issue/console issue we would ALL experience the exact same thing. 

Connection issue? Maybe. HDD issue? Possibly? Dodgy patching/install? Maybe!? PS3 issue: no. 

Regardless of you agree with me or not (I'm sure you won't), I defo can deny that PS3 is much more difficult because I personally have experienced both and find it equal in terms of 'difficulty'. I use controller on both platforms. I have friends who play on both or just PS3 and have no issues. I've encountered numerous people on PS3 who do not have these issues. I do not use SSD on my PS3.

keypuncher,Republican,1390822214.0,"&gt; Interest will not go back up, it will only keep going down (that is what the FED has no choice but to do), it will only go back up when the FED can not lower anymore and that is when the worst financial crisis will hit.

The Fed has the ability to set interest rates on Treasury Securities to anything they want, in the same way that a retailer has the ability to set prices to anything they want.  

If a retailer sets their prices too high for what is essentially a similar product to their competition, then nobody buys their product.  If the Fed sets interest rates too low when there are other countries with better stability and higher rates, then nobody will buy US securities.

So, the Fed has to set interest rates at a level high enough that people will buy.  Up to now, we've been fortunate that Japan, China, and the EU are all shaky enough that US securities have been a good deal even at 1/10 of 1% interest.  Much of the EU is beginning to recover, however - and that is going to siphon investment away from US securities.  That doesn't even touch on the fact that one of the larger buyers of US securities has been the Fed itself.

There are a lot of things that could put us in a situation where the Fed has no choice but to raise rates in order to get enough investment to finance the government."

sworebytheprecious,GirlGamers,1390822489.0,"&gt; I’m sure you know about Anita Sarkeesian and the controversy surrounding her videos. I’ll use her as a starting point to explain my platform. While I agree with Anita’s basic goals, I disagree with the way she went about achieving them. Her snarky, offensive tone immediately alienated many of her viewers. People, understandably, felt like she was calling them stupid and sexist for enjoying the games she pointed to as containing sexist elements. She was not respectful, and her childish, angry tone really hurt her work, not to mention her choice of examples.

you have come from a very misleading and ill-pinioned place . she was not snarky, her videos were objective to the tropes, well referenced, and most of all: she received rape and death threats *before she made them.* if anything, she gave as good as she got.

&gt;  want to reach out to people and educate them, change their minds. That’s not going to happen if they view me as an enraged feminazi trying to take away all tits.

what... well, what am i to say? *you used a rush limbaugh 90s reference in a call for a senior capstone piece on a female oriented gaming subreddit.* i can't think of anything to say to you, that would not get me called a feminazi, by you. that's a pretty large rabbit you have pulled out of your hat. it's a term loaded with hate and derision.

let me clear up this thing: i think what you are asking for is ideas for a project on women in video games that is not going to get you called ""nerd bitch."" why do i say that? well, because ""feminazi"" is pretty much reddit's new safe word for calling a nerdy woman a bitch. it's a vile thing. it's comparing feminists to goose stepping millions wide murders from the forties. feminists, to my knowledge, never took over most of europe in the forties and slaughtered millions upon millions. nor have we declared war on russia or allied with japan and italy. so, as a fellow academic, might i suggest you can that right now.

don't.. don't ask for any more.. oh lorde...

&gt; I’ve been doing a lot of research, and I think the best way to tackle this project is to view it as a communication problem.

a communication problem. you are not IN communications. you are a DESIGNER. you are a WRITER. let me communicate this to you: the way women are desgined, and communicated to by popular game makers and designers, is hostile. when i watch duke nukem forever i see rape and phallic glorification over my agency. when i see how princess peach uses tears to fight villians, the game makers are telling me my sorrow is a real neat trick^TM to use in battle. and you would level to me that is a misunderstanding. i don't buy that. i think you are smarter than that, but misled enough to think that i should dismiss it. and i will not.

so. no, i will not give you ideas right now. you have a lot of learning to do. i will not help you with not being a ""feminazi."" that is a slur here, and as comedic as it sounds, people DO use it as a slur so it's hurtful and at all in place with the academic tone you wished to have. and i won't help you communicate how misunderstood we all are to each other. it's not intellectually honest and neither are you right now.
 
go think about what you really wanted to gain here. i am sure i don't know what it is.

Basilgate,WritingPrompts,1390822916.0,"Jimmy was still awake, and sat upright when he heard a knocking at his door.

*Could it be Father Christmas?* he thought. *Maybe he wants to thank me for the cookies and milk Mum left for him?*

“It’s Julie,” came his sister’s voice, and he fell back to bed with a sigh.

“What do you want?” he said, returning to his thoughts of tomorrow’s presents.

“Are you awake?”

He didn’t answer. It was late, and he didn’t want to be too tired for opening his gifts.

“Jimmy,” she said, louder now.

“What?!”

“There’s a reindeer outside.”

“What?”

“In the woods, I saw it. It was big. Really big.”

“Shut up. Go to bed.”

“Look out the window. It’s there.”

Jimmy threw back his covers with a huff and walked to the window. He wanted to prove her wrong quickly so he could go to sleep, but a part of him was a little excited by what he might see. Thick snow covered everything outside. There were no lights on anywhere, but the sky was clear and the moon was bright, so Jimmy could easily see the trees at the border of the woods, across the main road. Sure enough, something was standing there, something on four legs, even bigger than a horse, with a great crown of fuzzy antlers.

“See, look there it is,” said Julie, who’d entered silently and now stood with her nose pressed against the glass.

Jimmy’s mouth hung open. He didn’t know what to say. *Maybe it’s one of Father Christmas’ that got lost.*

“We could give him a carrot,” his sister said.

Jimmy made for the door and Julie followed. He found himself grinning at the thought of how grateful the reindeer would be. They tiptoed down the hall, so as not to wake their mum, and then down the stairs to the kitchen. They rummaged in the fridge until they found the biggest, tastiest-looking carrot, and then they were at the front door. Jimmy helped Julie with her coat, her boots, her hat, her scarf, and then her gloves, then hurried into his own.

The air was crisp and cold, and the only sound was the soft crunch of the hard packed snow under their wellies. They didn’t bother looking both ways as they crossed the main road.

“Can you see it?” Julie said, her voice muffled by her green scarf.

“Let’s just get to the woods.”

A lump of snow fell from the branch of a nearby tree with a gentle *thwump* when the two of them approached.

“Look, over there.”

Jimmy spied it, trotting deeper into the woods. He brandished the carrot like a knife and followed. A faint jingle of bells came from the reindeer with every step it took, drifting through the trees, fuelling Jimmy’s excitement, and his theory that this was indeed one of Santa’s.

“Do you think it’s Rudolph?”

Jimmy hadn’t seen it’s face yet, so he couldn’t tell. He guessed it was Dasher. Maybe it’d be able to tell them when they caught up to it. Absently, Jimmy noticed something scrawled on the trunk of a tree as he passed it. Y’JJOTH. It was nonsense, so he ignored it. 

Finally, they came to a open glade, where the trees had parted, and the reindeer had stopped. It had looked big from the window, but now it looked truly massive. It stood motionless before a tall black stone, with its back to them. Something whispered in Jimmy’s ear.

“Huh?”

“Hmm?”

“Did you say something?”

Julie shook her head, she was transfixed. Jimmy took a deep breath and paced towards the giant creature, holding the carrot in front of him. He wanted to see its face, at least, but as he got closer he found himself looking only at the odd, black stone. It seemed very out of place, and had no snow on, or even near it. The grass showed in a wide circle around it, but it was all dead and twisted. The surface of it shimmered and Jimmy heard another whisper in his head, louder this time. *y’jjoth* it seemed to say *y’jjoth.* All of a sudden, Jimmy felt a nauseating urge to run. To turn away and never look back. He almost didn’t realise that the reindeer was now looking at him.

Somewhere, far away, Julie was screaming. Jimmy wanted to scream too but no sound would come out. The reindeer had no face. There was only an eye. A terrible, unblinking, three-irised eye. He noticed that its antlers were arms. Human arms with reaching, clawing hands. The world seemed to thrum and pulse, and the whispers in his head were now a lunatic choir, wailing with inhuman adulation *Y’JJOTH Y’JJOTH Y’JJOTH Y’JJOTH!* The trees swayed and the ground heaved. Jimmy fell to his knees and looked up at an alien sky, where insane constellations of stars shone with sickening light. The reindeer approached, its great eye peering hungrily into his soul. Invisible bells chimed merrily with each step, and Jimmy found, now, that he could scream."

Not only is this essentially the god of the gaps argument, you seem to be completely laughing in the face of those who want it legal so that there can actually be scientific study of these chemicals.

I'm not doing much by any means, but even if it's a set of push-ups at the end of the day, no matter what else went on, I'm about a month into my string of ""no more 'zero' days,"" and it's working--I've developed guilt over getting to the end of a day, lying in bed while reading a book, well on my way to sleep, and then I'll remember I hadn't done anything exercise-related since waking up, so I'll drag myself to the floor for push-ups or a plank or whatever. It's becoming a habit again.

The best way to avoid those end-of-day moments is to do something earlier in the day, which means having time to do another something before bed, and then another. It's quietly but quickly building back up. My knee has its own WTF moments still, but they're becoming more infrequent.

The idea that someone's conception of the greatest post punk song wouldn't be by Joy Division is a pretty alien one to me. So why would a person pick Transmission?

You put in your interests and what kind of friend you are. (Social butterfly, social, takes a bit to open up, recluse) I specifically said in my profile ""I don't party, smoke, drink or do drugs. If I drink it's for special occasions. "" and this one moron sent me an invite to go clubbing with her and several other girls 45 mins away from where I live. I sorta wanted to hit her in her face. I declined politely though. So you have to stand by your morals. You'll find girls who are similar to you if you are patient though. I've met two girls from there that are pretty kool.


Definitely give it a try. You can go as slow or as fast as you want. Good luck with your search for friends! I understand your situation!"

VienneseCrispyFish,AskReddit,1390825963.0,"Its a pretty lame story compared to other stories but I'll share it anyways because fuck you

So my best female friend lets call her Amy was in France for half a year and she got fucked by some french dude she had something going on there so when she came back she got into one of my male best friends lets call him Garry (its a pretty big group so everyone made out with about everyone at least once). But that does'nt matter too much.

So anyways she was acting mature and shit even though shewas younger than all of us just because she had sex before all of us. Side note: We're all around 16 or 17- she turned 16 about a month ago. So yeah it was pissing Garry and me off that she'd always say she's more mature than anybody so once when she said in class ""come on guys be a little mature"" just because we made a stupid joke I said 

""Just because you got hammered by some french dude does'nt mean that you're matur.....rurxwfog...derp.""

I finished halfway through the sentence because I realized it was a bad idea. Garry was giving me that disappointed look since they're dating but he almost burst out in laughter cause it was the sad truth. Turns out after school when I tried to talk to her she'd start crying and yeah. She was mad for a few days 

Garry and Amy are a happy couple and I'm better friends than ever with both of them.
By the way I was so sorry and felt so guilty that I allowed her to slap me as hard as she could. Video on request

BonzoTheBoss,AskScienceFiction,1390825986.0,"I never really liked the ""farming"" theory of the Borg. It instills the Borg with a level of subterfuge I just don't see them having. The Borg are highly adaptive and powerful, but they're also direct. They see something they want and they go for it, often regardless of the cost. (Look at the Omega particle) Collectively they are probably the most intelligent species in the galaxy, but their collective nature also means that they often opt for the simplest approach, which is to assimilate rather than investigate or research new technologies themselves.

Their ultimate goal is to achieve *perfection*. If they determine a species is worthy of assimilation, allowing a segment of that civilisation to continue to exist would be permitting imperfection to endure. Why bother ""farming"" a species when you could just turn the combined processing power of the collective into research and development? The reason I often see this theory floated is because people argue why don't the Borg send a million cubes to take out the Federation, why do they just keep sending one at a time? They must be farming!

Well, there can be several in-universe explanations. First of all is the possibility that the Borg just don't consider the Federation a priority. Even with resource intensive transwarp conduits, the Alpha Quadrant is still on the other side of the galaxy. Most of the time a single cube is more than sufficient to assimilate a species. If it's not, then usually that means the species has found some unique way of countering the cube, so having more than one won't necessarily help. We do see scenes where the Borg send multiple cubes, but that could be for a closer species. After the first couple of cubes, perhaps the collective simply bumped the Federation assimilation index down the list. There is still a lot to do with the civilisations being discovered on the borders of Borg space that don't require a lenghtly transwarp journey. Since future Janeway helped Voyager get home, destroying the transwarp hub and Unamatrix One in the process they may be re-prioritised.

Secondly it could be a matter of resources. Yes the resources of the Borg are vast, but they're also in a constant galaxy wide war of conquest. That has to take it's toll, especially when you consider the Borg may be doing battle in other spatial realities (a la Species 8472).

Also, a small nitpick, but I believe it's been quoted on screen that the Borg only control ""thousands of systems, millions of vessels"". I suppose it's possible they didn't realise the true scope of the Borg's true domain, or they were only counting those star systems with an ""active"" Borg presence (e.g. there could be millions of ""rocks"" the Borg have rendered uninhabitable within their domain and no longer have a use for, we know they can scoop entire cities from orbit)."

joker_of_the_deck,Cricket,1390826361.0,"Sigh - I typed out a whole huge explanation and clumsy-pressed the very inconveniently placed back button on my keyboard before I could submit it.

In short - no. Book cricket is played by randomly flipping open a printed book (with each flip representing a ball bowled) and assigning an action to the page number that turns up in the flip.

For example (the rules I used), if the page ends in:

2: Batsman gets two runs. Retains strike unless end of over.

4: Batsman gets 4 runs. Retains strike unless end of over.

6: Batsman plays dot ball (unless previous flip also brought a page ending in 6, in which case, batsman has hit a six).

8: Batsman takes one run. Loses strike unless end of over.

0: Batsman is out. Second flip to determine how out.

On second flip: 0 = bowled, 2 = lbw, 4 = caught (two more flips to determine catcher), 6 = stumped, 8 = runout.

One notes down the result of each ball and effectively plays through a cricket match ball by ball.

At the very least, you need to work on your jealousy and paranoia.

So every time you find yourself with negative thoughts or wanting to look through her things, tell yourself it doesn't matter why she dumped you because she still has, then start the usual thoughts to help yourself get over it. This is a habit you need to get into because you really, really don't want to be a jealous girlfriend in your next relationship. "

The part that is fried gets that way because apparently the US version requires the headlight to be on at all times, when means that when you hit the starter, the extra juice from the headlight can toast the electrode. It gets even worse when you use a 55w or 65w headlamp, instead of the OEM 45w Halogen.

I won't risk even putting a Ultrastar bulb (55w) in there, as much as i want too, let alone a HID kit. FYI, vendors sell relay kits for this bike for the headlight and the horn, that can handle more power, but are designed with the stock parts in mind, just because this is a common enough issue."

From my time exploring vaults in the Mojave, I remember that the computer systems were connected to a computer system on an Enclave owned oil rig that was somewhere out on the Pacific ocean (don't quote me on the location).

The Enclave was behind the Vault-Tec company and were trying to figure out how to built the perfect post-apocalyptic society. The data from the vault experiments was supposed to help them do that. They didn't really care about the people in the vaults, they just needed answers to questions, so the vaults were set up as elaborate studies.

Unfortunately, since I've spent my whole life wandering the Mojave area, shooting raiders and, in general, just being a merc, I have no idea if they were able to use the data or what happened to the Enclave. Around the Mojave, the Enclave is pretty much extinct. 

Now if you'll excuse me, some shifty-looking young punk just rolled into town and I need to ask him if he feels lucky before he tries to rob the Dino-Bite gift shop. Novac just ain't been the same since the Legion and the NCR got kicked out and Vegas *really* started to grow. "

Lluxx,actuallesbians,1390828753.0,"I'm a bit late to the party here, but although nothing you can do will be easy now, I've always put the choices in this situation simply, like this:

1. If you want to stay with her, you have to tell her the truth. 

2. If you are certain she'd break up with you/realise the relationship wasn't working out, hence why you cheated, and decide because of this to break up with her, don't tell her the truth. 

Yeah, maybe she'll leave you. Probably she'll leave you, if she's already been through cheating in the past. But if you hid it it would only make things worse and when she found out, she'd feel the pain of being lied to and not allowed to make her own choices as well as the pain of being cheated on. 

But, if you're going to break up with her anyway, spare her the pain of her worst fear being realised. Normally I'm all for honest communication, but in this case I'd say it's better to leave her trust in people a little more intact so she has a better chance of a successful relationship next time. 

If you do decide to stay with her (or even if you don't, really) you need to find out why this happened. The fact this guy kissed you and you swapped numbers implies that you fully expected things to escalate the next night. So even if you were wasted, there was some degree of expectation. Maybe I've read that all wrong, but if that's the case it says this wasn't an impulse thing and you need to work out what drove you to make those choices.

clockworkgirl21,worldnews,1390829192.0,"Here is everything circumcision removes:

1. Frenar Band, or Ridged Band

The frenar band is a group of soft ridges near the junction of the inner and outer foreskin. This region is the primary erogenous zone of the intact male body. Loss of this delicate belt of densely innervated, sexually responsive tissue reduces the fullness and intensity of sexual response. [Source: Taylor, J. R. et al., ""The Prepuce: Specialized Mucosa of the Penis and Its Loss to Circumcision,"" British Journal of Urology 77 (1996): 291-295.]



2. Mechanical Gliding Action

The foreskin's gliding action is a hallmark feature of the normal, natural, intact penis. This non-abrasive gliding of the penis in and out of its own shaft skin facilitates smooth, comfortable, pleasurable intercourse for both partners. Without this gliding action, the corona of the circumcised penis can function as a one-way valve, making artificial lubricants necessary for comfortable intercourse. [Source: P. M. Fleiss, MD, MPH, ""The Case Against Circumcision,"" Mothering: The Magazine of Natural Family Living (Winter 1997): 36-45.]



3. Meissner's Corpuscles

Circumcision removes the most important sensory component of the foreskin - thousands of coiled fine-touch receptors called Meissner's corpuscles. Also lost are branches of the dorsal nerve, and between 10,000 and 20,000 specialized erotogenic nerve endings of several types. Together these detect subtle changes in motion and temperature, as well as fine gradations in texture. [Sources: 1. R. K. Winkelmann, ""The Erogenous Zones: Their Nerve Supply and Its Significance,"" Proceedings of the Staff Meetings of the Mayo Clinic 34 (1959): 39-47. 2. R. K. Winkelmann, ""The Cutaneous Innervation of Human Newborn Prepuce,"" Journal of Investigative Dermatology 26 (1956): 53-67.]



4. Frenulum

The frenulum is a highly erogenous V-shaped structure on the underside of the glans that tethers the foreskin. During circumcision it is frequently either amputated with the foreskin or severed, which destroys or diminishes its sexual and physiological functions. [Sources: 1. Cold, C, Taylor, J, ""The Prepuce,"" BJU International 83, Suppl. 1, (1999): 34-44. 2. Kaplan, G.W., ""Complications of Circumcision,"" Urologic Clinics of North America 10, 1983.]



5. Dartos Fascia

Circumcision removes approximately half of this temperature-sensitive smooth muscle sheath which lies between the outer layer of skin and the corpus cavernosa. [Source: Netter, F.H., ""Atlas of Human Anatomy,"" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): Plates 234, 329, 338, 354, 355.]



6. Immunological System

The soft mucosa (inner foreskin) contains its own immunological defense system which produces plasma cells. These cells secrete immunoglobulin antibodies as well as antibacterial and antiviral proteins, including the pathogen killing enzyme lysozyme. [Sources: 1. A. Ahmed and A. W. Jones, ""Apocrine Cystadenoma: A Report of Two Cases Occurring on the Prepuce,"" British Journal of Dermatology 81 (1969): 899-901. 2. P. J. Flower et al., ""An Immunopathologic Study of the Bovine Prepuce,"" Veterinary Pathology 20 (1983):189-202.]



7. Lymphatic Vessels

The loss of these vessels due to circumcision reduces the lymph flow within that part of the body's immune system. [Source: Netter, F.H., ""Atlas of Human Anatomy,"" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): plate 379.]



8. Estrogen Receptors

The presence of estrogen receptors within the foreskin has only recently been discovered. Their purpose is not yet understood and needs further study. [Source: R. Hausmann et al., ""The Forensic Value of the Immunohistochemical Detection of Oestrogen Receptors in Vaginal Epithelium,"" International Journal of Legal Medicine 109 (1996): 10-30.]



9. Apocrine Glands

These glands of the inner foreskin produce pheromones - nature's powerful, silent, invisible behavioral signals to potential sexual partners. The effect of their absence on human sexuality has never been studied. [Source: A. Ahmed and A. W. Jones, ""Apocrine Cystadenoma: A Report of Two Cases Occurring on the Prepuce,"" British Journal of Dermatology 81 (1969): 899-901.]



10. Sebaceous Glands

The sebaceous glands may lubricate and moisturize the foreskin and glans, which is normally a protected internal organ. Not all men have sebaceous glands on their inner foreskin. [Source: A. B. Hyman and M. H. Brownstein, ""Tyson's Glands: Ectopic Sebaceous Glands and Papillomatosis Penis,"" Archives of Dermatology 99 (1969): 31-37.]



11. Langerhans Cells

These specialized epithelial cells are a component of the immune system in the penis. [Source: G. N. Weiss et al., ""The Distribution and Density of Langerhans Cells in the Human Prepuce: Site of a Diminished Immune Response?"" Israel Journal of Medical Sciences 29 (1993): 42-43.]



12. Natural Glans Coloration

The natural coloration of the glans and inner foreskin (usually hidden and only visible to others when sexually aroused) is considerably more intense than the permanently exposed and keratinized coloration of a circumcised penis. The socio-biological function of this visual stimulus has never been studied.

The glans ranges from pink to red to dark purple among intact men of Northern European ancestry, and from pinkish to mahagony to dark brown among intact men of Color. If circumcision is performed on an infant or young boy, the connective tissue which protectively fuses the foreskin and glans together is ripped apart. This leaves the glans raw and subject to infection, scarring, pitting, shrinkage, and eventual discoloration. Over a period of years the glans becomes keratinized, adding additional layers of tissue in order to adequately protect itself, which further contributes to discoloration. Many restoring men report dramatic changes in glans color and appearance, and that these changes closely mirror the natural coloration and smooth, glossy appearance of the glans seen in intact men.

[Source: P. M. Fleiss, MD, MPH, ""The Case Against Circumcision,"" Mothering: The Magazine of Natural Family Living (Winter 1997): 36-45.]



13. Length and Circumference

Circumcision removes some of the length and girth of the penis - its double-layered wrapping of loose and usually overhanging foreskin is removed. A circumcised penis is truncated and thinner than it would have been if left intact. [Source: R. D. Talarico and J. E. Jasaitis, ""Concealed Penis: A Complication of Neonatal Circumcision,"" Journal of Urology 110 (1973): 732-733.]



14. Blood Vessels

Several feet of blood vessels, including the frenular artery and branches of the dorsal artery, are removed in circumcision. The loss of this rich vascularization interrupts normal blood flow to the shaft and glans of the penis, damaging the natural function of the penis and altering its development. [Sources: 1. H. C. Bazett et al., ""Depth, Distribution and Probable Identification in the Prepuce of Sensory End-Organs Concerned in Sensations of Temperature and Touch; Thermometric Conductivity,"" Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 27 (1932): 489-517. 2. Netter, F.H., ""Atlas of Human Anatomy,"" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): plates 238, 239.]



15. Dorsal Nerves

The terminal branch of the pudendal nerve connects to the skin of the penis, the prepuce, the corpora cavernosa, and the glans. Destruction of these nerves is a rare but devastating complication of circumcision. If cut during circumcision, the top two-thirds of the penis will be almost completely without sensation. [Sources: 1. Agur, A.M.R. ed., ""Grant's Atlas of Anatomy,"" Ninth Edition (Williams and Wilkins, 1991): 188-190. 2. Netter, F.H., ""Atlas of Human Anatomy,"" Second Edition (Novartis, 1997): plate 380, 387.]

Removing this without a medical need and without the consent of the person is altering the way the penis works and removing thousands of nerves and erogenous tissue. If this practice wasn't connected to a religion (as you can claim religion and get away with almost anything, look at how few priests have been prosecuted for raping boys), it would be considered mutilation by society. 

I have no problem with Jews or Judaism. If any other religion was doing this, my response would be the same. I am not advocating against circumcision because it's a Jewish tradition, but because the human rights of infants are being ignored. I am sorry if anyone feels like their religion is under attack, but the fact of the matter is the act is non-consensual and you cannot permanently mark another person's body without their permission without it being a human rights violation."

aidrocsid,changemyview,1390829363.0,"It's not just restaurants either. I drive a taxi, I make 40% commission. If I get 15-20% tips per ride that's about a *third* of what I'd make for the day. Given that I drive loads of people who either aren't familiar with tipping culture or are entitled (usually rich) and disagree with it, though, on a lot of days I'd have to get really lucky with a few more generous people to balance it out. It's not the end of the world, but it makes my job, which is quite dangerous, less consistent and less profitable overall. It most certainly contributes to the turnover rate. It's especially apparent (though ironically less immediately significant financially) when I drive someone somewhere 3 hours away and they give me a shitty tip. 10% down from 15% might not amount to much on a small bill, but on a big one doing some shit that took me 6 hours that's another bill I can pay. Hell, even a trip a few cities over will at least cover my lunch if I get a decent tip, but if I get nothing? It's not nearly as worth it. 
  
People will stiff me after I've already loaded and unloaded their 5 or 6 gigantic suitcases and not bat an eye. These are almost *always* people with money. Students at private schools from countries without tipping cultures are the *worst*. These people are bleeding money but they never tip. Working class people, on the other hand, almost *always* tip very well. It's the people who have the least who feel how much that tip means. 
  
It certainly seems to me that right now people are shittier about tipping than they once were. When I was a waiter about 10 years ago I could count on one hand the number of times somebody stiffed me. Now I hear about it all the time, and people are stiffing me in the cab all the time. Somewhere between entitlement and things becoming a bit tighter than they once were a lot of people seem to have lost sight of the folks who provide the services that allow their lives to function. That's not okay. "

The race organization and the volunteers should have been prepared for someone to be really slow...it happens occasionally.

&gt;Ability to ""run"" this marathon? Don't make me laugh. She ran no part of this marathon.

She ran it very slowly. She totally undertrained for it; she's never done this before and had no idea how to properly build yourself up for a marathon. People like her don't need the running community's rejection and scorn and judgment because she failed - she, and others like her, need encouragement and need someone to teach them how to properly train instead.

&gt;She's not a fellow runner.

Why, because she's not good enough for you? Get over yourself. She runs - it's slow, but she runs, and that makes her a fellow runner whether you like it or not. She's trying to better her health, and having people like you condemning her because she's not healthy yet won't make anything better."

The popular example is often the phrase ""kdo s koho"" where the ""s"" doesn't really make much sense to most people, but it's an archaic usage of the 4th casus which binds with ""s"". 

Anyway I guess what I'm trying to say is that Czech has all those declensions and casus and conjugations *on top* of what English has as well. And it's much easier to learn to speak grammatically correct English than it is to learn to speak grammatically correct Czech. "

seakeg,anonymous123421,1390831832.0,"&gt; Several folks have pointed out that a lot of what I've described above can be applied to much of modern feminism, too

Based on some of your arguments and the fact that some people are saying this stuff happens on both sides of the coin, wouldn't it be a good idea to have a place where these two movements can come together?

somewhere where men could say, and I quote:

&gt; ""hey, you ladies have done a really fantastic job and we totally support that because, like you, we're all about equality. However these are some issues where things are unequal the other way, and maybe if we sat down and worked together we could help bring both genders to a fairer and more equitable and less acrimonious place.""

...and vise-versa for the ladies, too.

I've always kind of fell in line with reddits generally negative opinion about the MensRights community here but you're right, underneath the more misguided nature of it there are some real and important issues that are (sadly) getting buried.

there should be a subreddit called something like GenderRights (GenderBalancedRights? GenderEquality?) where these communities can come together, make an honest effort to understand one anthers valid concerns and do what you said: find solutions."

I've done activism work for years, and this isn't the kind of charity I want to be associated with. It's funny- I really need the job and thought I'd be able to do close to anything at this point, but this has put things into perspective for me. Sometimes, you can't sell yourself short. There is also the whole 'we decide if we keep you or not' after training deal, so I'm pretty sure I'm out of there. I will stick with it until I find something new, but I refuse to lie or answer untruthfully to people who are writing cheques for something they trust.

ulvok_coven,AskMen,1390832532.0,"Mmmkay, let me explain something to you about one night stands.

One night stands are fun. There are done for fun. If the people had anything more between them than a desire to get it in, they would have dated. These are not ex-boyfriends. They are male friends who she has had sex with. Friends have sex sometimes.

I'd guess it's pretty obvious that you'd take it the wrong way, so it makes perfect sense she wouldn't tell you. Kind of shitty, but to be honest, your lack of context and your conflation of that with certain moral values would make that a risky move on her part. Obviously she doesn't feel confident, or perhaps not trusted, enough to try to explain to you the context you're missing.

Well, that, and she really doesn't need to tell you, because it really doesn't matter. Some people feel more need to be honest about that than others. I would never advise someone not to be honest about their past, but I think it should tell you about how she feels that she didn't.

Welcome to the 21st century, where sex is not sacred, and is instead very trivial. Obviously she's in a relationship with you and one would imagine she's not interested in sleeping with those guys.

As for the people in this thread saying, 'you should have your feelings!' my advice to you is get over it. Your feelings are based on past actions of hers for which you have no reference. You have to consider what her thought process is when you decide to judge her. She had sex, probably because she wanted to and for *no other reason*. She didn't tell you she had sex with these guys because it's trivial. No one is laughing at you (unless she has ridiculously bad taste in guys), they're just people she knows."

behindtimes,baseball,1390833170.0,"I think pace is misleading, though I'll agree that football is definitely more TV oriented.  One major difference is that with baseball, the game can be over near the beginning of the game (e.g. your opponent scores 9 runs in the top of the first).  The same really doesn't happen in the NFL.  Even blowouts are pretty close, at least for the first quarter.

b00tler,Parenting,1390833198.0,"Maybe it depends on where you live. Where I live, pertussis incidence has been relatively high in the last few years. People mistakenly attribute it to anti-vax parents but in fact (at least according to CDC) the issue seems to be that adults and older children don't get boosters often enough to prevent the spread of the disease. That's compounded by the fact that in adults &amp; older children it's mistaken for a cold or allergies because the symptoms are mild. Until the baby can get her own pertussis shot -- at two months -- any exposure to unvaccinated people carries a risk. So it's standard in our area for doctors to advise new parents to ask that anyone who will spend a significant amount of time with the newborn get an updated DTaP shot, and to avoid having anyone with cold/cough/""allergy"" symptoms in contact with the baby."

BagsOfMoney,AskWomen,1390833238.0,"It may be mostly a semantic difference, but it seems to me that one way there's not a problem, and the other way there is.

Going out in a social situation with the express intention of putting yourself out there to improve your social skills is something a lot of socially anxious people have to do, including me. *Social situation* is the key word phrase here. Don't go out to the grocery store and expect receptive people. Go to a bar, party, book club, or other social event where people expect to talk to other people. Second, be aware that people might reject your conversation attempts. This is okay. Sometimes people don't want to talk, and you need to not press. Third, flirting is okay. Tons of people go out just to flirt without attaching anything to it. 

The way some people seem to be interpreting your question (and it may be the way you're intending it for all I know) is viewing interactions with women as ""test cases."" They're not social experiments, they're people. So as long as you view them as people with thoughts, feelings, and desires, you'll be fine."

I have no clue why they would include that in the description of the normal ticket, but I guess that's where your confusion comes from? It's only included in the Berlin Welcome Card Museum Island, so if you wanna go there and have it included in your ticket, don't buy the normal one.

Fishlegs/Meatlug are better at precision shooting and Snotlout/Hookfang would have had to set fire directly on the ice and would have melted it (as we see later) the twins are the only ones who can make a wall of gas and then light it as it make a floating wall of fire.

BullNiro,soccer,1390834018.0,"There are worse groups. Australia's group is worse.

Spain are Spain. Netherlands will have to make very few mistakes mistakes to beat them but they are a football team, they are beatable, their players don't seem as dominant as they used to. If anyone in the group could do it it's Netherlands.

Chile are a strong side but they concede goals, the Netherlands on the other hand don't really concede as many goals (I don't think) and I think you could argue are possibly also stronger than Chile going forwards.

So knockout stages are eminently possible, though not easy. Brazil or Croatia probable in the 2^nd round. The Netherlands will have nothing to fear against either of these teams, neither are particularly dominant so it's just like any other. Then England/Uruguay... At this point getting further cannot be considered a fluke (Spain, Chile, Brazil/Croatia, England/Uruguay seems like a tough schedule to me) so this is what I would call par for the Netherlands. To advance further will mean they will have to play very well indeed, which they are capable of, but they'd have to play the teams that are playing well enough to get this far."

I see a lot of people say his ganks are sub par without flash because you have to run up to them but I never have issues with it. Just run behind them and save the stun for when they flash idk he's not too hard to play

Also people are turned off by the prospect of his comparably weaker teamfights and lategame ""fall off"" compared to other junglers, though late he can snipe turrets with no minions from 100% and solo baron and split among many other things. 

Phoenix is a power farming type of champ that excels against melee comps and while he's always been extremely powerful he's not really a tier 1 pick because other jonglers fit the meta better or have something like a hard engage or better sieging and what have you "

Behave the way you're OK with. Some people will like it, others won't. The first category is where you could find friends. Depending on your character, there will be more or less people there (for me, there are only a little, but it's right).

If you try to please everyone, people will feel it and it's an awkward feeling, not the one you want to feel when talking to a friend. Plus, they will have a distorted vision of yourself, and like you for something you're not."

vanessss4,WaltDisneyWorld,1390834758.0,"My favorite moderate resorts are either of the Port Orleans properties. Both are very quiet and very relaxing, not terribly spread out (I believe Port Orleans French Quarter is the smallest), have nice pool areas, and Downtown Disney is a quick and relaxing boat ride away. They also have horse drawn carriage rides if you're looking for something different and romantic. ;)

Coronado Springs is a nice resort but it's big and laid out around a giant lake. The lobby is on one side, the pool is on another. It's not a quick walk between them. Still a nice resort, but there is a convention center  at this resort so you may get a lot of busy business men and women which might not make it so relaxing. 

My least favorite of all of the moderate resorts is Caribbean Beach. It's alright, nothing super special IMO. It's decorated very tropical (obviously) but to me it seems like any South Florida hotel. 

Caribbean Beach is closest to Epcot, Coronado Springs is closer to Animal Kingdom, and Port Orleans is still pretty close to Epcot as well. Also, all of the pools are pretty nice and follow the themes of each resort well. "

Consumers, looking for something better, have since jumped on the new players: Buffalo wild wings, Panera and Chipotle.

Även om en permanent avlägsning av förhuden är värre (i min mening) än att göra hål i örsnibbarna så är det liknande situationer, en kirurgisk kroppsmodifikation på barn som inte är gamla nog att själva göra ett aktivt val. Vissa personer tycker att det inte är en stor sak att omskära pojkar och för dem kan det vara likvärdigt att förbjuda omskärelse av unga barn eller att förbjuda att göra hål i unga barns öronsnibbar.  
Det betyder inte att de är dumma i huvet, för dem kanske *du* verkar vara en idiot som vill inskränka på föräldrars rätt att bestämma över sina barn. Det enda det betyder är att ni har olika orsaker.

Att kalla /u/dt3ft dum i huvet kommer inte hjälpa din sak i det minsta, du kanske till och med gör mer skada än nytta genom att ogiltigförklara hans/hennes åsikt, för vad är det för mening att lyssna på och diskutera med en person som ändå inte bryr sig om vad du tycker."

I am also planning on marrying a Christian (also could be described as a ""lukewarm"" Christian). We've talked about the wedding ceremony, and we agreed that a church ceremony is fine, my only stake in the ground is that the pastor doesn't ask any questions or make any forward statements in his sermon like ""And may the raise their children with strong faith in our LORD"" or "" And do you, welliamwallace, promise to love you wife as Christ loves the church?""  etc.

It honestly might be sort of tricky to find a pastor willing to do that. We will see. 

As for children, our short conversations have basically come down to: I don't care if you teach them Christianity you can even take them to church, etc. But I am going to be honest about my beliefs with my children.

I was really nervous about walking up to get my award for some reason. I used to get really nervous before my name was called for attendance in the morning, or when I had to introduce myself to someone.

When I walked up to get my award, I tripped on the carpet and fell in front of the class. And then I realized that my teacher called ""Lindsey"" instead of ""Lizzie"" so I had to sit back down and get back up when my award was actually announced. It was mortifying."

1.) When you go somewhere like Applebee's your whole meal will cost ~15% more than listed due to the tip. Just because someone carried it to your table and refilled your drinks.

The thing that sells it as a DP album for me is that it's off-kilter for what I'm used to (even after the TRON: legacy soundtrack), so it provides a refreshing and very welcomed change, rather than just another album of cliché dance tracks.

bcerz811,tall,1390836822.0,"Nah, I don't like making people feel insecure about something they can't control. I know men take just as much flack for being ""short"" as many women do for being ""tall"". And as I've gotten older (late twenties now), I've finally started coming across far less men who have problems with women taller than them (although...being married now does help...). Puberty is tough on everyone, so looking back, I feel a little more forgiving about the 15 year old guys that gave me crap growing up. They were probably as insecure as I was. At this point, I actually tend to run into more women who feel the need to make comments than anyone else anymore, but again, you're right. Age has a lot to do with it. It is becoming more and more rare for me to meet someone in my peer group (26-35) who has to make a negative comment about my height. It is usually teenagers to early 20s, or upper middle aged and elderly people. 

The first time I saw someone taller than me at the grocery store (after moving 400 miles away from my hometown), I was practically giddy with excitement. She looked confident and beautiful, and I felt like I suddenly had a teammate. :) I wanted to follow her around the grocery store like a puppy. I refrained, I promise. The more I've traveled and the older I've gotten, the more people I've run into who are my height and taller, and it's just been exciting to me and helped increase my own confidence. If other women can walk tall in heels at 6' and up with confidence and grace, suddenly it didn't seem so impossible that I could too. It's been a process, but I'm much more comfortable with my height than I was years ago. Still not QUITE confident enough to wear 6 inch heels, but enough not to slouch, and enough that when people ask how tall I am, I'm not afraid to say 5'11"" instead of ""oh...5'10...ish...""""

Discovering this subreddit also helped. Sometimes I want to show it to everyone I meet who acts shocked at a tall girl so that they can see if they look around them, there are plenty of tall beautiful women out there, just like there are plenty of very short beautiful women out there. Maybe then they'd see that there are plenty of other things to talk about other than height! "

harder to find, maybe locally, but the internet has everything at the best price + free shipping (if you are into that sort of thing). 

MC tires are around $100-$200/each, similar to car tires. Similar costs to mount and balance, etc. Half as many though. 

**BUT...**

MC tires last 5-10k miles maximum. Car tires usually have a low end of 30-40k.

As far as insurance, that depends on the location, type of car/bike, amount of coverage, and the driver/rider. I've seen people paying thousands a year to ensure GSXR-1000, and i've seen people pay virtually nothing for car coverage (that covered absolutely nothing)."

She managed to keep the Pharisees and Sadducees from getting at each others' throats, by giving the larger Pharisees positions of religious power without taking the Sadducees out of their positions of general privilege.  This kept that issue from tearing Judea apart.

However, she was both overshadowed by a later ruler, and had her remembrance lessened by the fate of her dynasty.  First, her successors couldn't quite get their act together and keep Judea from erupting into civil war, which eventually led to the region falling into Roman domination, and eventually becoming part of the empire.  Second, one of her successors, Herod, is really well-known.  He built lots of things (most notably he renovated the Temple) and he was crazy and killed lots of people.  So everyone remembers him, but no one remembers his most significant non-crazy predecessor.

He claimed it was a joke, and made a comment that straight people should be able to ""handle it"" I replied ""oh, I guess I'll just make mine 'I hate gay people' since hating people due to their sexuality is funny now"". He got really upset, went on a long rant about straight privilege and how the world is ""run by straight people"" and really lost his shit. 

Sorry for going on a bit of a tangent, but that reaction really rubbed me the wrong way, and has me seriously concerned for what people think activism really means. "

American citizens will be hurt because unemployment will be higher, their wages will be lower, more people will be on welfare (not immediately the illegals, but the people they displace from employment), and the Social Security and Medicare systems will be even more broke than before (illegals won't be immediately eligible for them, but will eventually, while paying payroll taxes on incomes of 1/3 the average American on which the systems are already going broke).  Also, since there will be no border security, the employment market for illegally low-wage labor will still exist, and will attract additional illegal alien labor - just as happened after the last 7 Amnesties.

Believe it or not, the human has natural mechanisms to bring us out of these thoughts, and into more positive ones. The problem is we don't realize, due to our worrying nature, that we have to go back and fix these thoughts. This turns into a habit and for some, we feel nothing but that tension spike. This tires our brain out, and the body's way of protecting us is to shut us down and make us feel like a hollow shell. The mind has had enough!

It's not so bad with growing up, but it's bad with marriage. The wedding legally makes you more committed. You can't just simply leave. If you experienced the flaws before the wedding you keep in the back of your head you can leave. They become associated, and you're more likely to consider it after a wedding if you lived together before hand.

But if you were simply just aware, but didn't experience, after marriage,it's harder to have a leaving idea in your head, so you're forced to communicate and work it out. "

rmigz,leagueoflegends,1390838643.0,"[](/kassadin), [](/kayle) and [](/nasus) are all suffering from the same type of balance problem.  After a certain point these champions reach a point of critical mass where they are able to 1 shot the other team's carries with little counterplay (chaining CC seems to be the most effective way to deal with them so it forces opposing teams into picks).  

Unfortunately, in my opinion, it's not possible to balance these champions without completely neutering their skillset because their kits promote this type of *anti-fun* playstyle.  

I have been playing Kayle on one of my accounts and it's unreal how quickly she can delete a champion with 3 items (Nashor's, Sorcs &amp; Lich Bane).  Add Deathcap and Void to that and you're practically deleting tanks regardless of their MR.  Really fun champion to play as, horrible to play against.  All 3 fall into this category.

Truth is that all 3 can lose lane and as long as they get 3-4 items they will become game-changing forces to be reckoned with."

What really surprised me here is how expensive many other gyms get away with being, when you can literally buy a half rack and full barbell set both new for the cost of a few months at some of these ignorance mills.


 It's not like your average consumer gym is a great environment anyway.

addeman94,sweden,1390838729.0,"&gt; Menar du på fullaste allvar att föräldrar ska ha rätt att perment lemlästa och stympa sina barn?

Nej, det tycker jag inte. Jag tycker inte att omskärelse av vare sig pojkar eller flickor bör vara lagligt, och inte att låta barn under tio (som ygnst, helt tretton) bör få skaffa hål i öronen, även om jag inte känner lika starkt för den frågan som jag känner för omsskärelse.  
Däremot har jag förståelse för att det finns personer som inte har samma åsikt som jag, och vet att de inte automatiskt dumma i huvudet för det.

&gt;Som jag redan har gjort på en extremt massa ställen i tråden så handlar det inte bara om att det blir fel och man får komplikationer. Man förlorar permanent viss känsel i snoppen.

Det stämmer. Jag har läst om flera personer som har blivit omskurna i vuxen ålder som vittnar om att de tappat viss känsel i penisen efter en tid av överkänslighet pga att ollonet är konstant blottat. Däremot är detta, så vitt jag förstått, inte en direkt konsekvens av att du skär av förhuden.  
Förhuden har en ganska stor koncentration nervändar, och när man skär av förhuden tar de nerverna plötsligt slut i ärret istället för förhuden, så ärret efter omskärelsen skall också bli ganska känsligt efter att såret läkt. 

Detta är däremot inget som påverkar barn som blir omskurna i spädbarnsålder särskiljt mycket, de har ju inte direkt några minnen av hur deras kuk kändes innan omskärelsen. Om inte något går väldigt fel under omskärelsen så kommer deras kuk fortfarande vara känslig, och de kommer (utom i undantagsfall) fortfarande kunna bli stimulerade av sex. Detta är snarare något som en person som blir omskuren i vuxen ålder bör tänka på.

Återigen, jag håller med dig om att det inte bör vara tillåtet att omskära pojkar som inte är tillräckligt gamla för att förstå vad de ger sig in på utan medicinska skäl, men din otrevliga ton hjälper inte till att övertala någon, snarare tvärtom."

So lighter bike, with the stock ~10k mileage dunlops? I'm guessing you don't load it up and could generally be described as svelte? 

i guess it's doable, but personally i wouldn't ride on those tires. nor would i wish you to try to keep up with me in the twisties.

Do you ride a lot on gravel/dirt roads? Could be a factor. Same for how ""intent"" you ride. But 26k highway miles in straight lines? Well, just because you can see thread on them doesn't mean your tires are good for another 5k miles.

Honestly though, the KLR650S is not the bike to base any assumptions of cost on. Is a damn fine bike with very little issues that doesn't weigh so much as eat tires and doesn't fit the sticky soft rubber sizes, so you are left with durable rubber. 

From your expereience that you mentioned earlier, I was thinking you were a KLR650 or Kawa/Honda 250. Those bikes can do some great things mileage and maintenance wise, but definitely don't represent ""average"".

I was definitely speaking of averages and probably some worst-case slant before. You, sir, are definitely an outlier in all sense of the word and i applaud your ability to mise so well.

But do your future-self a favor and reward your bike with some new rubber! in 26k miles, so many heating/cooling cycles will harden the rubber and make it crack or make it chalky and you'll wipeout/lowside in a corner, if you happen to get in trouble and need to tuck her in around a corner.

psychicsword,PoliticalDiscussion,1390839098.0,"Income inequality has increased when you look at it in terms of raw cash in hand income rather than total benefits. These days we have to look at total compensation because workers don't just get a paycheck. Workers get pensions for when they retire, health care for when they get sick, and disability and life insurances all from their employer. When you calculate all of those added benefits in you actually see that the average worker is making more today than they were making in 1970 when they received none of those things. The reason the poor are hurting so much today is largely due to rising costs associated with things that are 100% necessary for survival. Housing, education, and health care costs have all increased way faster than inflation and that is hurting the American poor far more than their income shifting from cash to benefits.

Edit: [To add a source](http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/WorkingPaper-9.pdf)[PDF warning] 

&gt;Burkhauser, Larrimore and Simon (2010:34) compare inequality of after-tax income at cyclical peaks with only cash (not in-kind) transfers included, and find Gini coefficients of .394 in 1989, .390 in 2000 and .396 in 2007— indicating virtually no sustained change in inequality of aftertax money income since 1989. After also including the insurance value of private and public health insurance (and thereby coming closer to disposable income), the Gini measure of inequality falls—from .372 in 1989 to .364 in 2000 and .362 in 2007.2

&gt;A Gini coefficient of 1 means perfect inequality (one person has all the income) and zero means perfect equality (everyone has the same income).

* I believe (needs to be tested) the *mark* option will mark the messages automatically as read in [get_message_unread](http://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_message_unread), which will reduce 1 API call for each transaction.

* Check if user is registered before API call to check user on reddit. Assuming that a registered user is on reddit will reduce another API call. I believe it doesn't do this for the *to* user, but should probably be done in the reddit check function.

* You can bundle PM notifications to users and send them once a minute or so, this might take some work so you might want to check logs on how often this will save you API calls.

* Remove Bitcoin and Fiat exchange rates. I don't think these are a requirement and taking these out looks like it will take out a bit of work.

Dabookitty,videos,1390839990.0,"Bringing in Military spending to a Healthcare debate greatly weakens your stance.  You are trying to compare apples to oranges.  How about we just look at Per Capita Spending on healthcare.  I've listed justa a few countries below.  All with very comparable standards and quality.  This completely eliminates the need to bring in Military spending or any other type of spending.  Per Capita the US spends more per person on healthcare then any other country...so you bringing in Military spending...so very pointless.  The per capita spending just leads one to wonder why it costs so much more in the US then anywhere else.

[Healthcare spending by Capita as of 2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capita):

1. USA:            $8508

15. UK:             $3405

BonzoTheBoss,DaystromInstitute,1390840065.0,"I agree 100%. It doesn't even make that much sense. Even if we assume Voyager 6 travelled back in time and met a less ""evolved"" Borg collective, the fundamental principle of the Borg is to achieve perfection.

No matter how far back in time you go, that core principle will be at the heart of any fledgling collective, that which spurred them on to start assimilating other species. This in my eyes disqualifies Voyager 6/V'Ger from ""enhancement"" as the Borg would view it as obselete technology, unworthy of assimilation or modification. Why waste resources on an inferior probe?

It's also said a race of *machines*, not cyborgs. We know the Borg started off as organic life forms from the Queen in First Contact; ""Humans, we used to be just like them. Flawed. Weak. Organic.""

I find it's a much more appealing narrative that a benovolent race of super-advanced, sentient machines would take interest in Voyager 6 and take pity upon it, advancing it to fulfil it's mission. It makes the universe feel larger and more diverse, fuelling the mystery of what is yet to be explored. Why must everything be unified into a single theory? Not everything in the universe has to be related to one another."

TG716,AskReddit,1390840417.0,"Coming from a kid whose parents divorced when I was 14, I'm 22 now: Kids will learn over time why things happened the way they did.  It's much better to have a household that isn't full of anger.  We feel it, I knew something was wrong for a long time before I found out.  I found out for myself when I overheard conversations between them and saw mail coming in from law firms, which was not the way that I wanted to find out.  

Depending on how old your kids are, be honest with them, but don't just spill out every detail.  I never learned specific reasons why my parents split until years after, and that was a better way to handle it. I wasn't mature enough at 14 to understand infidelity and emotions attached to it.  

Over everything don't let them think for a second that they are responsible for it.  My mother and father instilled in me from the beginning that it was not my fault at all, and that they both loved me and my sister very much, that it was just a result of mommy and daddy having problems.  Your kids are going to be very upset, and things are not going to be like they are right now, probably ever again.  They are going to be extremely vulnerable.  I lost focus in school, my friends, my hobbies, because all I could think about was my family.  Be there for them while you take care of your legal issue, they are what should be most important. You're an adult and have learned to handle strong emotions and big life changes. If your kids are young, they are not built to handle that alone yet, don't let them.  

If divorce is inevitable and is only a decision of when to do it, just do it.  Start the healing from day 1, and focus on making sure your kids are okay.  It will help you as well as them in the long run if you are there to support them, and they will respect you later in life for doing it. 

Good luck

I can just go off my latest personal experience, hiring a lawyer for the purcashe of a Home.  The average price was $1000-$1200 for the service.  Not really a big change when calling around.  But then with Lawyers the free market does have the ability to work and keep prices in check.  They provide important services, but not important to your continuing survival.  Free Market policies fail when your life or a loved ones life in on the line.  They have the goods/services and they know you will pay for it because what other choice do you have?

JAPH,Albuquerque,1390840810.0,"&gt; night life, lowish crime

There aren't a huge number of areas with both of those attributes.  Downtown and central by the university are about the two places with much resembling nightlife.  I would still be careful around those areas late at night (bikes get stolen at both places weekly, or even more often, and there can be the occasional mentally-disturbed transient wandering around).  I'm not sure I would want to live in either of those places (I lived near the university for two years, got out, never looked back).

There is a ton of pretty decent mountain biking in the Sandias, the foothills, and the Manzanos.  There are a few groups around, and a trail maintenance group operates in the foothills.  Bring slime, goatheads are everywhere.  Drink lots of water and test your limits slowly, riding at 10k feet can hit you pretty hard.  There's a lot of good places to ride within 15 minutes of Tramway/Central.

Traffic isn't usually bad.  I commute from the Tanoan area (near Academy and Tramway) to the AFB, and it takes me about 15 minutes by car, 30 by bike.  There's a pretty good-sized bicycling community here as well.  My advice would be to try to live on the same side of the river that you work on (commuting over the river has always been a bad time), and try to live east of where you work (sun rises are beautiful, until they shine right in your eyes the whole way to work.  I got about two years of that as well).  Public transportation exists only in the form of the bus system.  I've used the buses a lot and never really had an issue with them, but they can get flaky if you live off a main route.  The special commuter lines they run are pretty good.

The spring can get a bit gusty, but usually under 30 mph.

Overall, I love it here.  The mountains are visible from every place in the entire city, and there aren't a lot of really tall buildings like you have in Chicago.  Our &gt; 300 days of sun a year never get old.  Everything in the city is really spread out so you're not really crowded in, but there's not a long drive to get anywhere.  The city doesn't have a ""rushing"" feel to it, and for the most part people are pretty laid back."

I see Q9450s (the processor I have in my old computer built in 2008) going for $150+ new.  For that price you could get a current-gen Core i5.  CPUs used to be much more expensive than they are now and retailers still want to make some of their money back on NOS items.

Not only that, parts from that era are all end-of-life, meaning you won't be able to buy new replacements, you'll always be using overpriced retail items that have been sitting in a warehouse for half a decade or taking a chance on used parts.

Weirdsauce,ShouldIbuythisgame,1390840914.0,"This is a repost of an answer i gave regarding BF3 to BF4. 

**BF 4 Pros:**

* Looks great
* Maps are good to very good although some are FAR too open, allowing snipers to have a field day
* Sounds great
* Lots of game play modes
* Commander mode is back
* AA devices (Igla/ Stinger) can acquire and deploy to target efficiently but damage does not appear to be as much as it was in BF3
* Good physics
* Destructible environments, structures

**BF 4 Cons:**

* Looks great at expense of your GPU. If you don't have a 78XX (or whatever the NVIDIA equivalent is, performance will be diminished)
* It's not Battlefield 2143 (biased observation as BF2142 is my favorite FPS of all time)
* EA believes we can't play a game without it being web based and having social media aspects. That's why no one could ever play BF 1942, BF Vietnam, BF2 or BF 2142 apparently. BF3 and BF4 are redonkulous [sic] in this regard. 
* Origin

I'm sure i could think of other things but i'll leave the list there.
As for BF3 v BF4, it's hard to say. Outside of new maps, a changed way of earning unlocks for weapons and mods or playing ""dress up"" on them and graphics improvements, i'm not sure there's much difference. Just because you put lipstick on a pig doesn't mean you have a new pig. On the other hand, BF4 is a sexier pig than BF3 in many ways.

Oh- and if you're interested in the single player experience of either- hell if i know. I don't think anyone other than reviewers play the single player parts of Battlefield. It's kind of an afterthought or marketing gimmick as far as i can tell. The previous Battlefield games didn't have ""plot"" and i seem to remember they fared rather well- but if EA wants to throw their money down that hole, along with Origin, that's their business- but just because someone calls a turd ""pudding"", it doesn't make it so.

K2TheM,cars,1390841074.0,"The ""Magic"" of the Miata video was it's resonance and ability to be shared. 

Anyone who owns or has owned a Miata has recited parts of that video to their friends and family when talking about their car. So on a basic level it's an echo-chamber preaching to the converted and giving them outside confirmation that what they have is good. No.. what they have is *the best*.

Many of the videos take an outside perspective and look at the car in the context of when it was released/ how it has aged. The Miata video does as well, but it focuses on the plus sides rather than stare at it's flaws. The Miata Review laughs *with* the Miata, not at it.

Helping all of this is the online car culture demographic. If you take Reddit's census (at least as far as I know) as a cross section of the internet, the average user is 20-30 and male. This is prime Miata owner territory. To that end this makes the content something that the average user wants to see, but more than that, the video is also easily sharable.

The Miata Review is unoffensive and devoid of the crass/ ""[Plinkett stye](http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/)"" (I don't know what else to call them) cuts. This makes it able to make into quaint family living rooms. It's a video you'd show your family. Sure *everybody* enjoys a good R rated movie, but they don't go back for a second viewing with their family in tow."

maximumoverbite,TaylorSwift,1390841228.0,"Here's my two cents:

For me, it's not really about how she was ""snubbed"" at the Grammys this year but how intense the competition was. I think had she released Red maybe.... two weeks before its actual release date, she would have been fine. But alas, Red came out when it did and there's nothing we can really change about that.

Was it a good album? No, it was an awesome album. Some of her best material is on that album. But when you look at the music that was released in the same window that the Grammys are giving the awards to, it felt inevitable (as bad as that sounds). Random Access Memories was my favorite album of the year by an absolute long shot. It was smooth, it was well-produced and every single track on that album was phenomenal. Daft Punk were sort of the under dogs this year even though they already had a very loyal fanbase for **years** before Random Access Memories. But that album helped them really get out there.

What I personally feel is the most important out of what happened at the Grammys was that she performed what could very well be the most important song of her career. All Too Well. To me, that's what is the most important. Never in a million years did I ever think she would perform it live at an awards show because of all the emotional baggage attached to it. At every performance on the tour for Red, she cried at some point during the performance. Sometimes, the tears came earlier than other performances. At my stop in Miami, she broke down during the little intro that she gives before the song starts. When she finished, you could see her silhouette walking off stage with a hand to her face wiping away the tears. It's ***that much*** of an emotional song for her. And she finally performed it live at the Grammys and I didn't think that would happen. Ever.

Taylor wasn't the only musician snubbed at the Grammys. Off the top of my head, Kendrick Lamar was *greatly* snubbed. To me, Macklemore is the ""safe"" rapper that the Grammy Foundation needed to fall back on. Even though Kendrick's album was universally acclaimed, Macklemore won. What bothers me the most about it is that Mack has more reason than ever to act like a self-entitled artist. Every award he's won, he feels the need to make a statement about how he's an ""independent"" Hip-hop artist. The fans also back him up with many a statement about how he raps about what's real. But I digress, as I really shouldn't make this a rant about how angry I am at Macklemore.

What matters is this. Taylor Swift didn't walk away empty-handed. She took a stand for herself and showed her vulnerability with a great performance of All Too Well. It must have taken a lot for her to even think about performing it live but she finally did it and now, hopefully, other people can think about her in a more positive light. She set a bar for herself with Red and while that may not have gotten any awards, to us, it's still a great album.

Here's to the next album! I'll definitely be here with you folks to discuss it and enjoy it!

Harasoluka,WritingPrompts,1390841274.0,"It almost seemed as if today would come and go as any other, untouched by fate and destined to pass unnoticed. It was a frigid day, and Terry could almost hear his chapped lips crack in the bitter winter air. He stepped into his car and pulled out his mobile phone.

“Call Sarah.”

“Calling Sarah, mobile or home?”

“Mobile.”

He pushed in the electric lighter in his car and pulled a Marlboro out of his pack, the heat had gone out of his car and his cigarette was the only warm thing about his drive home. 

“Hello?”

“Hey, it’s me. You cooking dinner?”

“No, I didn’t have time to get to the store today.”

“Okay then, I was wondering if you’d like to try something new today. Sully told me about a great new Thai place on the corner of Court St.”

“Do you really think the kids are going to eat Thai?”
 
“Oh it’s good for them, and Eric and Abby need to learn to appreciate different things, we can’t very well have spaghetti or chicken nuggets every night.”

“Fine, but you have to drive.”

“Fine by me, see you soon. Love you.”

He rounded a corner, and cracked his window. He didn’t want the car to smell like smoke; after all he had to set an example for Eric and Abby.

He drew his last on the half finished cigarette before flicking it out the window. As he pulled in the drive he reached into the console, and pulled out an aerosol and quickly covered the scent. He idled in the driveway until he saw his wife open the door and his two children waddle outside, dressed as warm as marshmallows. 

Sarah sat the kids into the car, and then herself. She leaned over and pecked Terry on the cheek as he pulled out of the drive. 

It wasn’t long before they arrived at the new restaurant. The exterior was reminiscent of an oriental palace, and the parking lot was small but full. Terry smiled as his children marveled at the large decorative door that separated them from the warm restaurant inside. Terry opened the door and his wife and kids filed in. 
“Welcome to Palm Thai, how many?”

“Four please.”

“Right this way.”

The kids led the way while he and Sarah followed behind. She wrapped her arm around his and pulled herself closer and whispered, “She has pretty good Engl—”

“—Sarah! Don’t be rude.” 

“It’s not rude. I’m impressed.”

Terry sighed as Sarah slid into the booth. They began looking over the menu, and they soon placed their order. The staff was incredibly friendly and even offered various samples.

“Try this, spicy egg roll with yummy sauce.”
 
“I don’t want to!” Abby cried. Sarah shot a glance toward her that was firm but loving.

“Abby dear, just eat it. Try something new I promise it’ll be delicious.” She said as she dipped the roll in the sauce and took a bite. 

“See,” she began, “it’s delicious!”

Abby looked wary but after Eric reached over and grabbed one of the egg rolls she decided she would too. Terry’s eyes were so intent on Abby and Eric he didn’t even notice his wife.

“Come on guys, go ahead. Eat it.” Abby looked nervous and she looked up at her mother for reassurance. Her nervous face evolved into terror.

“Daddy, what’s mommy doing?”

Sarah’s face was red, almost purple and she was beginning to dry heave. 

“Oh God, your epi-pen, where is your epi-pen Sarah?” He grabbed, the waitress passing by, “Are there peanuts in the yummy sauce?”

“We cook everything in peanut oil, sir.”

“Damn it, where’s the epi-pen Sarah?” She pointed at her purse. Terry reached over and grabbed the purse and began digging through it wildly.

“It’s not in here. It’s not home is it?” Sarah nodded in a panic.

“Put your coats on kids, we’re leaving.” Terry hurried his kids and wife into the car and sped, red light through red light rushing to the pharmacy. 

He helped Sarah out of the car, and hurried her through the door. 

“Somebody help us! I need an epi-pen!”

The pharmacist looked at him, and then at Sarah. His eyes widened, “Yeah of course!”

The manager seemed to hear this and hurried over to the pharmacist. Terry could barely hear him ask if he checked them for a prescription. After a little arguing the manager coolly looked over and said, “I’m sorry sir, but we require a prescription for epi-pens. Do you have one on you?”

“Look at my wife you idiot, just give us the damn epi-pen!” The manager was obviously shocked, but he was compliant. He walked between the shelves, and came back empty handed.

“I-- I’m sorry it appears we’re out of them at the moment. We can’t help any customer’s without a prescription anyway.”

I don’t know if she gave up after hearing that the pharmacy was out of epi-pens, or if she just didn’t have enough air, but with the bad news Sarah fell to the ground. The sound of her head cracking against the ground obviously affected the pharmacist. He ran to the back and came back with an epi-pen in hand. The manager grabbed his arm, 

“They don’t have a prescription, do you want to lose your license?”

The pharmacist shook free and ran to Sarah, he jabbed her in the thigh with the pen. Terry and the pharmacist waited patiently for a sign, for her to breathe deeply and come out of it. Seconds felt like minutes, and seconds revealed the blood pooling under her auburn hair. 

“S—Sarah? Damn it, call an ambulance, something!”

He reached for her neck, and felt her pulse. “Sarah don’t do this to me, don’t do this. Sarah wake up honey, wake up baby.”

The moment her blue eyes went gray carved itself into his memory like a bright light against morning eyes, and he knew; Sarah was gone.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390841287.0,"&gt;I've discovered a decent sized minority to be shias from the Eastern region.

Troublemakers the government wants rid of.

&gt;If even 20% of those were from outside the privileged upper classes, which I suspect is more than likely the case, this to me presents a grave danger to the Saudi government.

There are ~ 20 million saudi nationals and ~10 million non saudi's resident in the Kingdom.  It is the loyal saudi nationals who have the guns.  

The House of Saud is backed by the US, and has no real inhibitions about massacring people who oppose their rule, and has quite a lot of external support for doing so if the need arises.

To the extent that all governments are in perpetual danger from their populace, sure, the House of Saud faces some challenges, but one of the perks of having an massive pile of money is that you can buy friends.  Which they have done.  

All of the educated upper classes in Saudi benefit tremendously from the organization of the state in their favour.   There's not really anything in it for them to flip things around.

Skall man få utföra ett permanent kirurgiskt ingrepp på ett barn som inte kan ge sitt samtycke penbart av kosmetiska skäl? När barnet blir gammalt nog för att ge sitt samtycke går det att göra en omskärelse, men det går inte (eller är extremt svårt) att ersätta avlägsnad förhud.

Dessutom utsätte du varje barn för en risk för komplikationer under ingreppet, även om det är en relativt liten risk för permanenta men som är stora nog för att hindra personen i sitt dagliga liv. Omskurna personer får oftast en minskad känslighet och behöver mer stimulans för att uppnå orgasm, men kan oftast ha ett fullgott sexuellt liv.

Så det här är en debatt mellan de som prioriterar barnets rätt att välja själv och de som prioriterar föräldrarnas rätt att göra kosmetiska ingrepp på sitt barns könsorgan i sin religions namn, och båda sidorna tyvärr har en alldeles för stark åsikt för att kunna lugnt lyssna på den andra sidans argument utan att genast bli ursinnig och idiotförklara den andra."

princesskiki,aww,1390841830.0,"**Photoshop**.    There are some super shitty breeders that photoshop their pictures to give the puppies enlarged eyes and shrunken noses.

This is a toy (""teacup"" I'm sure) poodle that has had its face significantly altered.   

There are NO dogs that look just like this.    Here are some more photoshops:
* http://www.designzzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Teacup-Maltese.jpg
* http://d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/6/tl/af/FBTLAFqhHMsybgL-556x313-noPad.jpg
* http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8470/8137210626_d4f6062144.jpg

These pictures all tend to come from the same handful of online breeder websites.  They charge upwards of $5000 for these dogs and you can clearly tell when looking at the video versus the pictures for the same dog how they have been altered.  Sizewise, they are generally accurate to the pictures..but their faces look nothing like this.  Breeders like this disgust me and it makes me sad that there are people all over pinterest/facebook falling for these pictures and running out trying to buy dogs that just don't exist looking like this.  :(

**edit** Here's another picture from the same breeder of the same dog in the same photoshoot.  Not as much altering was done to this one and you can really see how much was done to the snout: http://www.boutiqueteacuppuppies.com/images/products/large_368_36.jpg"

I think I responded something like, ""So Christmas is the only holiday, it's distinctly an American holiday, despite the fact that Jesus predated this country by 1776~ years, therefore a car that's built in Ohio and Alabama can't put their name in the word 'holiday?'""

I'm not getting into splitting hairs. Your opinion is your own. You can be a miser and do it right and cheap. You can neglect and still do it cheap. Or you can have a hobby and a labor of love and pay whatever it takes.

Imo, it's a hobby and like all hobbies (note: making money off a hobby means it's a side occupation that you enjoy), it's just a whole to dump money into.

jongbag,changemyview,1390842195.0,"&gt;Long story short, your meal is gonna include that extra 10% no matter what, so you're forking it up one way or the other. This is just the current method our culture utilizes for the transaction. It may not be ideal, but you need to participate. 

15% is considered the minimum you should tip- for average service. Any less than that and you're either trying to send a message or you're being inconsiderate. 20% is considered the standard for exceptional service.

This goes for all service industries- at least in the US. Your barber, your barista, your restaurant server, etc. I realized a while back I'd been undertipping my barber- who does an incredible, painstaking job and is super inexpensive at just $15- for months. I felt really terrible and paid him double for my cut the next time after I realized.

I think part of the thought process behind tipping is to encourage and cultivate a relationship between people in the same community, and also, as someone said above, to allow for smaller local businesses to remain open and competitive. 

Unless it's happened to you, it's hard to express how much it means to someone in the service industry to receive a great tip after we have tried really hard to make your experience/service a good one. There is no better show of appreciation than that. And, speaking as a barista for several years, most of us genuinely want to make you happy by giving you a product we make skillfully and take a lot of pride in. I genuinely love introducing someone to something I am passionate about, and having that resonate with them in a genuine way. Do I do this for a tip? Partly. But it goes far far beyond that.

&gt;Hides his 'Duke Silver' interests out of shame.

It has nothing to do with being manly or not manly.   It has more to do with his personal interests and not wanting them to blend with his work life.  Notice his later ego is also extremely manly.  Technically it is actually more manly not to shove his successful alter ego in people faces.  He is also reserved, polite, and does not like attention.

&gt;The attempt to fit the 'manly' stereotype is, in itself, childish. When bowling, he chides Tom because 'people can see' him bowling unconventially. Haverford has more self-confidence that Swanson does.

Again this has nothing to do with being manly.  He is insulting tom because tom looks like an uncoordinated idiot in doing what he is doing.  His style often does not work well.  This has nothing to do with being manly or not.  This has more to do with him being polite and reserved than being manly.  Reserved polite people do not like making scenes and displays of odd behavior in public.



&gt;The ""manliness"" is an image Ron's character tries desperately to project to those around him (and, as a result, to the audience), and people conveniently don't notice that he's really just a man-child that likes eating lots of meat, hates people, and has a mustache.

sockmonkeysaurus,AskWomen,1390843212.0,"I used to want someone who made me laugh, and who shared a lot of the same interests as me.

Now, I want someone who loves the same way I do, with all their heart. I want someone that knows how to be there for me completely, emotionally, physically, and mentally. I want someone that puts the same effort into relationships that I do, and someone who looks out for my own best interest with the same intensity that I do theirs. I want someone that follows through on their promises, instead of letting me get my hopes up for nothing. And I want someone who understands that relationships take work, and doesn't treat relationships as disposable rather than put in effort. 

I used to want someone who I felt I couldn't live without, and who couldn't live without me. Now I want someone that encourages me to live my life to the fullest, and pushes me through different endeavors. I used to want someone who literally made me their everything. Now I want someone that can be independent, and allows me to be independent. 

I used to want someone who would hold me tight and make me feel safe. I used to want someone to kiss away my tears and cuddle me gently. I still want those things. That hasn't changed from the time I was younger until now.

I want someone that puts 100% into the relationship like I do, because I put 100% of myself into everything in my life. I want someone that wants to go on adventures with me and discover new things with me. I want someone that doesn't take all the little things I do to show them I care for granted. I want someone who will surprise me with a home-cooked meal, or surprise me with a back rub after I worked a 12 hour shift. I want someone who tries to look at things through my eyes, because when you care about someone, you try to put yourself into their shoes so you can understand them.

Way to not state teh truth of the incident.  A perp who was refusing arrest and fighting back was accidentally killed when the paramedics decided to stick a tube down his throat which may or may not have been necessary.  Upon arriving to the hospital they had to redo the tube as the first one was not inserted correctly.

But you go and post an issue that is nothing like the video in question.  A real issue where the cops that fired the lethal rounds need to be charged with murder.

This is why there will be no change in how corrupt the police are.  People jump on every incident without looking for facts.  You only hurt your argument by bringing up the other case which involved a combative perp.  This one is clearly the cops firing unnecessarily."

Which means, considering it does actually exist, that you want an entire country and its population to be wiped off the map or be forcibly relocated.

I don't know, now that a Jewish state has actually *been created* and *existed* for more than half a century, Zionism and anti-Zionism have taken on a lot of different meanings. Usually I write off anyone who uses the term ""anti-Zionist"" as a racist asshole, so I'm not totally disagreeing, but it doesn't ipso facto mean they want all of Israel and its citizens to face re-location or genocide.

The only indication they'd even have is servers complaining, and that's already something servers complain about. Short of a bunch of people quitting and giving the reason that they just don't get tipped enough to make the job worth it anymore simply refusing to take part in your side of the transaction doesn't do anything but make you feel smugly justified and screw someone out of a few bucks.
  
Keep in mind that if you weren't paying for service with a tip it'd be factored into the price of whatever it is you're buying. People pretend that it's some righteous ideological position, but really it's just a matter of *how* the same amount of money is exchanged. The only real sensible motivation for not tipping it to save money, which you could also accomplish by just stealing your food outright and be no less of a jerk. Really the primary problem with the tipping culture in the US is that it enables cheap jerks who don't care about the people they hire to do things to skimp on their bills.

mooli,climateskeptics,1390843594.0,"&gt; Since we cannot have expert knowledge of many subjects, we often rely on the judgments of those who do. There is no fallacy involved in simply arguing that the assertion made by an authority is true. The fallacy only arises when it is claimed or implied that the authority is infallible in principle and can hence be exempted from criticism.

http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Appeal_to_authority.html

&gt; This fallacy is committed when the person in question is not a legitimate authority on the subject. More formally, if person A is not qualified to make reliable claims in subject S, then the argument will be fallacious.

http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-authority.html


&gt; It's important to note that this fallacy should not be used to dismiss the claims of experts, or scientific consensus. 

https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority

&gt; Appealing to authority is valid when the authority is actually a legitimate (debatable) authority on the facts of the argument. 

http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/21-appeal-to-authority


&gt; The appeal to authority is a fallacy of irrelevance when the authority being cited is not really an authority.

http://skepdic.com/authorty.html


... etc

Besides, the wiki article makes the important distinction between deductive and inductive reasoning in that definition you quoted.

[edit:] To stress this point - by the standards of deductive reasoning, neither of us can prove the meaning of the term ""Appeal to Authority"", because in doing so we rely on external sources (authorities) any one of which could be wrong. So in citing wikipedia, your claim as to the meaning of the ""Appeal to Authority"" ironically falls foul of that same fallacy - unless we apply inductive reasoning, in which case the linked article doesn't support your claim.

I understand the sentiment but not in this case. Skiing, there are multiple dangerous outcomes that can occur without proper tutorial and is pretty much a sport, without any artistic elements to it, if we're defining art very literally. Piano is a whole different playing field. Someone  can play the piano, learn how to play the piano, follow notes on the page all by one's own effort and practice.

It doesn't balance because I **do** know the facts.

&gt; Illegals still work.

They absolutely do.  That's how they increase unemployment and drive down wages for Americans.  When legalized, they'll be able to compete directly for legal work instead of indirectly, increasing the unemployment and wage depression.

&gt; Plus the DREAM Act doesn't make everyone a citizen. It is very specific about it.

Yes.  They can't be convicted felons or terrorists, and must have been in the US before 12/31/2011.  That's not much of a bar to get under.

&gt; Plus the people who would gain citizenship are already working. 

&gt; Some are.  The CBO assessment of SB744 assumes 12 million illegals immediately, plus another 20 million over the next 10 years.  Personally I think that is a conservative estimate.

&gt; How would it hurt unemployment if they are already working?

They are currently working for illegally low wages.  Once legalized they can no longer do so, which means they will be competing directly with Americans for jobs instead of just working in jobs that would have to pay higher wages if there were no illegals to do them.  Further, because the market for illegal labor will still exist, more illegals will come to take advantage of the vacuum left by the newly legalized workers.

&gt; There is Border Security and there will always be border security.

No, there are border patrol agents, and they're being told by the current administration to not secure the border.  That isn't border security.  It doesn't matter how many extra people you have if they're being told to not do their jobs.  Further, under the bill, the additional border security specified in it (like finishing the wall) is at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security.  Our last Secretary of Homeland Security is on record as saying we didn't need more border enforcement (conversely, Texas alone caught half a million illegals crossing in 2013), and our current DHS Secretary believes giving the illegals a 'path to citizenship' is a matter of national security - so we can be pretty sure he isn't planning to secure the border either.

&gt; You can never have 100% fool-proof system ever.

No, but as we recently proved, the Border Patrol is catching less than half of the border crossers - or more properly, less than half of those we detect with airborne radar, which won't be all of them.  We need to finish the wall authorized and paid for in 2006, and actually start enforcing our laws.

&gt; Social Security is running on surplus, it needs tweaks so that it can run even longer.

Not even close.  Social Security has been paying out more than its revenues since 2010, and that is not ever expected to change.  Medicare since 2007, likewise.  Both trust funds exist only on paper - the money was spent long ago.

&gt; Illegal alien labor will always be attracted, you can't do anything about it.

Wrong.  We could secure the border as the Democrats promised to do after the 1986 Amnesty (and all the others since), and start enforcing immigration law both on illegal aliens and their employers.  We could also cut illegal aliens off from access to US social services and change birthright citizenship to require that at least one parent be a US citizen or legal permanent resident.  After a few employers go to prison on felony convictions, it will start looking less attractive to the remainder - and if there are no jobs for illegals, access to the safety net, or chance of their children becoming US citizens just for being born here, there is no reason for them to come here.

&gt; DREAM Act doesn't legalize illegal alien labor, it just provides a path to citizenship to a specific section of that labor who were not responsible for their own plight. 

They are absolutely responsible for deliberately breaking our laws to come to the US.  If they want to be US citizens, we already have a path to citizenship for them.  It is called going back to their home country and immigrating legally - in line behind all the people following our laws.

&gt; Read the god-damn bill.

I have read it.  Have you?

&gt; Stop rehashing the conservative talking points.

Maybe they're 'conservative talking points' because conservatives are willing to take an objective look at what the bill actually does, instead of blindly accepting what the pundits say - and we're coming to the same conclusions.

Maybe you should consider stopping parroting the liberal talking points and actually thinking about the consequences for a change."

Jynweythekylow,FancyFollicles,1390844011.0,"Chemical treatments such as bleaching does jeopardize the integrity of your hair. Also shades of red are especially difficult to maintain as they fade the quickest and are also the hardest to remove. You should definitely plan on having it done at a salon to ensure that you'll get a result that not only closely matches your goal, but that your hair will remain as healthy as possible. At home lightening is never something i would suggest trying just to save money, as its likely to not give you the results you're after. 

It depends on where you go, the thickness of your hair, and some other factors, but it probably costs somewhere between $60-$150 to get it done professionally. But every salon is different so it's a good idea to call around and ask for quotes. Some people dont like to quote prices over the phone especially if you're a new client since they haven't gotten a chance to actually examine your hair. You might expect to pay more if they have to remove a bunch of color from your hair before anything else. Your hair has the potential to be pretty  dry afterward, but a good conditioner usually helps to combat excess dryness. Also, getting a trim afterward can help as well, because the ends of your hair are more porous and dry anyway, so that's where you'll probably see the most damage. Straw like hair after lightening usually occurs because it was over processed. A knowledgeable stylist should know how to avoid.this. "

6) Your inline fan/filter combo will create a negative pressure in the box which makes air go in through every hole.

Phaedrus49er,bodyweightfitness,1390844693.0,"Two-time hamstring tear-er here, once a slight Grade I, once a severe Grade II (never hit a full-tear Grade III, thankfully).

Hamstrings are annoying, mainly because you might think you're fully recovered, but you're really still a few weeks away from being there. Ever wonder why hamstring injuries continue to nag some professional athletes? Because they keep getting back out there when they feel better rather than adhere to a timeline, which admittedly seems excessive (until you re-injure the site).

As others have said, roll. Full-size foam rollers aren't great for hammies, though--you need something more precise, whether that's a lacrosse ball, a Thera Cane, even a Stick, or something similarly pinpoint-y.

Focus on isometric strength at different points in the range-of-motion. Hamstring injuries almost always occur during movement, usually the concentric phase, so start back with glute bridges (bent-knee and straight-knee), working up from two legs to singles, and lunge holds. Single-leg, stiff (not straight) knee RDLs are great for rehab, too. When you re-start more dynamic work, work the eccentric phase only for awhile (it'll be mostly bodyweight stuff).

Muscle fibers are supposed to join in parallel, like straight fingers intertwining; however, you mentioned scar tissue, which is those fibers joining at odd angles (this is where trigger point therapy and Thera Cane-ing comes in, or find an active-release therapy practitioner). While flexibility is important, leaving the scar tissue in place only puts more stress on the intact fibers in the long run, leading to more injuries down the road. Get that scar tissue broken up. It'll take awhile, but it's worth the upfront investment.

Be well."

jda,networking,1390844991.0,"There are two parts to this: getting connected to the internet and getting connected to the people. Think of it as the easy part and the hard part.

The nice thing about your location is you are next door to one of the most competitive markets in the US for wholesale bandwidth. 

**The easy part**

You need a place to stash your gear and connect to upstream providers (transit). 1/4 cabinets from ServerCentral seem popular right now for this. 

For your two providers, you want one ""budget"" provider to handle the bulk of your traffic (think of it as offloading your peering) and a non-budget provider to route around quality issues with the budget provider (you likely can't afford to use a premium provider for everything).

Peering: Right now you can get transit cheaper than a port &amp; crossconnect to the Equinix peering exchange. I think there's also a little independent exchange but in any case when you are starting out peering is a distraction you don't need. Worry about it after you've been around for a year and have some spare time to geek out over networking.

Providers: that would be HE.net or Cogent. They should cost between $0.50 to $1.25 per meg. Content networks use them because they are cheap and then eyeball networks (think Comcast or TWC) don't buy big enough connections to them and let the traffic congest (among other things) which gives them a bad name. This doesn't matter for you because your users want their content (Netflix, etc). Now, you probably should pick up some bandwidth from another provider (nLayer, Level3, etc) for when the budget provider flakes out. If you can swing enough bandwidth try to get a low commit with 95th percentile billing so you aren't paying through the nose for it. Try to go in with some other providers so you can get a VLAN with BGP on a shared port and aren't stuck with a crazy bill for premium bandwidth that your users won't notice.

Connecting out of the datacenter:
There is a decent amount of metro fiber around Chicago. You'll use this to get from your colo out to your network. You want a flat-rate GigE at a minimum. You get screwed on pricing on anything subrate. Ideally you get a 2.5G or 10G wave.

Router: 
You don't need much. You are just going to be doing BGP with your providers and being a gateway for your clients. On the low end people use old Cisco 3550s, Mikrotik on a PC server, Ubiquiti EdgeMax, etc. The low end of ""proper"" is a Juniper MX5 or Cisco ASR1K. 

Bottom line:
Getting your network connected to the internet should cost between $4k and $10k per month with anywhere from $2k to $50k in equipment and setup fees. Construction costs for extending fiber to the datacenter to your location should eat up most of this.

**The hard part**
This is slightly easier if you have millions of dollars to wave around, but only slightly. You have to remember that (unless you live somewhere truly wonderful) no matter what they say most cities work and think like a big business, just one that pays lip service to residents instead of shareholders. If you have any faith in the goodness of government this is a good way to lose it.

No, you don't get to just use existing cables. Generally speaking there is fiber for utilities (traffic control, etc) &amp; fiber owned by providers. You can't touch the fiber owned by other providers. You might be able to touch the fiber used by utilities if the utility department is forward thinking and not run by a bunch of curmudgeons that don't want any extra risk because retirement is coming.

If you walk into a city council meeting and say ""hey, fiber would be awesome"" you likely won't get shot down but you also won't get anywhere useful.

Generally speaking cities are cool with giving you access to the right of way *if* you pay them. You'll pay them a tax on revenue, you'll pay them for permits, and if you are lucky they won't come up with special permits for you to pay just because. Look at Google's contract with Kansas City to see how they head off these issues.

Now, assuming you want the city to do it, and not just let you do it, you need to win over the department that would run it. This would probably be the electric utility but if you don't have public power, perhaps the water utility. If that's all privatized, good luck. If they are on board they need to fund it. This is probably a bond issue. They need to believe that incurring debt for faster internet is a higher priority than incurring debt to build roads, upgrade water lines, and repair the local swimming pool. Good luck.

You are in a suburb with a heavy old-school tech presence. Expect a lot of resistance from at&amp;t etc."

When I start my next tank, I'll be using potting soil again but using gravel instead of sand. Keep in mind that while you can always vacuum your substrate, taking too much out at once will cause your plants to uproot.

I don't approve of the former, but honestly I'm not entirely sure why. 

The kid is pretty likely exposed to it at home. Right or wrong, being in the vape shop for ten minutes is probably no worse than being at home on the couch next to a vaping parent. 

Like it or not, vaping is a vice. Though bad effects have yet to be discovered, I would liken it to responsible drinking. Putting a kid into an environment influences their actions. You wouldn't take your kid to the bar after work, even if you just have one beer and then go home. I'm sure you've probably stopped with your kid for a six pack at the gas station though. The trick is, vape shops are like a liquor store and a bar rolled into one. 

So... **TL;DR**: if you're treating the vape store like a liquor store, stop in with your kid, get your juice and go home. If you're visiting it as you would a bar, leave your kid at home."

Let's focus the plot more on Amelia Earheart for some reason, then roll credits!"" In most Trek shows, weird or dangerous shit happens, they somehow get out of it, then try to explain what happened as best they can, then take some sort of lesson or character development from it. In Voyager, weird shit happens, they kind of sort of get out it, scene skips later to issue somehow resloved, they smile at each other, credits roll."

I feel appreciative of my birth parents knowing they weren't in a place to take care of me and give me a loving and consistent home.  If you give your child to someone you know (the father or the family), you would need to figure out what's going to work for you--you might want visitation, how would the child be told you were hid mom, etc, so I think it's important to discuss it as much as possible with all partied involved.

Adoption is probably the least selfish thing a parent who isn't ready emotionally or financially to have a child can do.  The fact that you feel like you can't talk with the father says that you two would probably have a hard time raising a child together.  There are tons of things you and the father will have to talk about over the years, so not giving the kid up for adoption isn't going to make anything easier in that respect."

Jinjahh,OneY,1390846394.0,"I have recently come out of a depression myself, and looking back, these are the things that helped most for me, whether a simple change in attitude or activity I took up.

- You say you don't want to commit suicide because of the effect this will have on your mother. This is good, and in fact a sign of strength. I felt the same during my depression and my therapist commended me for it. Suicide is a selfish act, and serves little except to move the burden to those close to you.

- You say the world would be poorer without you. I felt the same. The solution: do something completely selfless. I started doing charity work at the local animal shelter, and knowing I was giving up my own time selflessly gave me a big boost in selfworth. I could no longer call myself a selfish, leeching prick knowing I voluntarily gave up my time to make their life better. Think of a problem in the world, and find out how you can help with preventing it. If it's shit work, even better. You'd be proving yourself that you have the strength to do something selflessly.

- This one's a bit silly, but I recently started wetshaving due to always getting rashes from cartridge razors. The ritual attached to this was very soothing to me and for the first time in my life I actually started to take intereste in taking care of my appearance. I couldn't care less how other people see me or whether they consider me ""hip"" or not. Despite this, taking general care of how I look has given me a great boost in confidence.

I hope these points help you in some way, as they sure did for me. Last week I had my last session of therapy, and in 6 months (as per the standard) I'll be stopping my anti-depressants.

PS: I feel strongly that the spot you're in is very similar to what I've been through. If you ever feel the need to talk in more detail, PM me. Communication with others suffering from depression has been soothing for me, and even though it is in itself not an actual step towards recovery, it can lessen the burden knowing you are not alone in it."

The configuration of quarks in neutrons is not really stable but can be stabilised if there are enough protons around. So if the ratio has more neutrons than a stable atom would, this eventually happens via the decay of a down quark into an up quark, an electron and an electron antineutrino.

I could tell you all the things you have going for you but you already know it on a conscious level I think.  But self-acceptance and happiness can't be found through being successful and being super hot.  

You gotta find a way to be OK with the parts of yourself you don't like.  You can't run or ignore being trans.  You have to work to believe that being trans is a good and OK thing to be, otherwise you won't be able to address what truly makes you unhappy and insecure.  

I think there's this transition narrative that happiness comes from passing and being pretty.  It doesn't.  Happiness comes from being free to live your life (that's where transitioning and passing comes in) and self-acceptance.  

So I guess don't feel like you're missing out on something by feeling this way.  It's more of problem with how we view transition as the great savior from your problems.  

I have the same sorts of thoughts.  Like I'm pretty and passable but it hasn't really fixed my life problems or my self-esteem.  Transition just made fixing those things possible.  "

Here's how I would write the program to break this: when given the ""mini-game"" captcha, it would first take a snapshot of the area. Then it would parse the text, which is simple because it's not distorted in any way. Then it would look for shapes, and match them to a database. Since it appears there's only a few different games with always the same shapes, this would be dead simple, even if some shapes are partially on top of other ones. It now knows where all the shapes are, and which shapes need to go where, and it's probably taken less than a millisecond.

That's why moving the shapes doesn't complicate this at all. In less than the frame refresh rate of your monitor my program would solve the puzzle. If matching fails because a shape is covered up, it would just keep trying until it's rearranged in such a way that matching succeeds. Then it's just a matter of clicking the shapes and dragging them to the goal, while of course adding some delay so it's not obvious that it's a program doing it."

Where are you travelling to? 

An umbrella style folding buggy or baby carrier will be your best option. Most train and subways have lifts but they're often in obscure corners of the station so it's much more convenient if you can carry your baby on the escalator. It's a good idea to fold your buggy down on subways to save space.

Most temples have gravel pathways which aren't so good for buggies. Many of them will require you to leave it at the entrance and although the attendants will keep an eye on it for you, from a practical point of view it would be easier if you could use a carrier.

Lifts in shops and department stores are often crammed. So again, a carrier would be easiest in this situation.

Department stores have the nicest baby changing facilities. Moonies brand nappies were good. I'm sure the other brands are fine too.

It's not just about the tone change on a mouthpiece, it's about how it feels. A 4C has a pretty small tip opening and a pretty small chamber size. When you move to something bigger, it is going to feel a lot different and you might not necessarily get a great sound out of it right away. You won't notice a tone change initially as much as the change you'll feel in the feeling of the mouthpiece. You might notice a little bit of a change at first but the more you practice on it, the better tone you'll get.

nesfor,Drugs,1390847742.0,"Of course we know the shock. The overwhelming majority of us were raised with the idea that drugs are horrible things that will ruin our lives at first touch, and we learn that while we can taste without consuming ourselves, substances like meth carry with them an inherent danger.

How can I tell you that I understand you? I'm sure you've heard it a thousand times. But I won't throw words at you about brain development and age, just as they were thrown at me. They made me stronger instead of bending me to society's will. I wasn't going to be like everyone else, slaves to this machine, working every day for the promise of a better life somewhere in the future, believing themselves free. 

But sit down with a homeless person for a while, and see what this freedom you seek is. Everyone dreams of it at some point or another -- throwing off the shackles of houses and families and 9-to-5 days and just wandering. It seems plausible, preferable, even glamorous at this point in your life, when presumably you still have a roof over your head and a fairly regular supply of food.  In your mind's eye, you'll never have to deal with hardship. You see the homeless huddled against buildings in the rain, the wanderers living in squalor. They had dreams like yours, too. But when you're outside in the cold because no one will let you in because you haven't showered in weeks, when you live in constant fear of the police because you have to steal food to eat once a day, when you sell every comfort and chase away every friend because the only thing that makes you happy is drugs, and you can no longer dream of any sort of future because you can only live high to high, then tell yourself: I am free.

You don't know how hard it is until you're there. And when you think it was difficult enough hitting rock bottom, you realize that climbing your way back up is a million times harder.

Can you picture being fifty? Can you realize the vast expanse of time stretching before you? How you'll change, all the things you could do? In forty years, do you really want to be doing the exact same thing you are now? It's all new and exciting for the moment, and that can last a long time, a decade, even. But after all the fun is over, you find you still have all these years to live through, and you'll have to clean up the mess you made and start again. The party *cannot* last forever.

I'm sure you're rolling your eyes or laughing at how overdramatic I'm being. Why would you listen to me? Your psyche is built on the solid foundation of knowing that you are surely invincible, that other people may get stuck in one life or another, but not you. You can make it. You can try every drug, no matter what it does to your brain and body, because those aren't important either. It's not like you only get one body and one chance at life. It's not like you have so many other choices. Do you know how many choices you have? Have you honestly thought about it? You can think that society feeds you the idea that happiness is being a cog in a machine, and then there are people who have the chance to love their job. I worked my butt off in school of one day being a scientist and saving the world, and while it sucked a lot sometimes, every day was worthwhile when I look back, because I made it, and I am literally living my dream. Without at least a high school education, what can you do? Fast food, cashier, car wash, service jobs, minimum wage, because the fact is we need money to physically survive in this society. Unless you run away to the tundra, giving up running water and clothes and steady food supplies, you cannot escape it. And tell yourself after a double shift when half the customers complain about their orders and you made barely enough to cover the day's food and toilet paper that you aren't a cog in the machine, and you are free.

This is dragging on pretty long. I could preach for years and still not get through to you. It took an overdose and a breakdown for me to break the mindset that you are in now. To learn that I don't actually always know what's the best thing to do. All of us here on this forum are just trying to look out for each other, sharing our experiences and our wisdom, trying to keep people from making our own mistakes. In this case, we're trying to stop you from making a mistake that could have permanent and terrible consequences. 

I don't believe in God, but if I did, I would pray for you. As it is, I will simply think of you and hope that one day you will know true happiness, the kind that lasts longer than any trip or high, found in the smile of someone you love, the satisfaction of a job well done, or just finding what low hush there is in this world, in a place where you are home."

it seems that mint has added some new make a budget features, allowing you to pay $$ for X months and budget it automagically over X months.

I don't like having that money as ""surplus"" to slush overages into each month, so i made a goal of my total yearly insurance costs in a monthly increment and didn't connect it to any accounts.

Edit: I feel like I should mention this when it comes to Mac, and I'm not trying to confuse you so ask me to clarify if you'd like. Macs shades are a little backwards; their cool (yellow) tones and warm (pink) tones are the exact opposite for most foundations (cool-pink, warm-yellow) so keep that in mind.

Futurecat3001,summonerschool,1390847952.0,"You die *way* too much.  5 deaths/game as Vayne is really bad.  You can get away with death averages that high on an assassin if your kills are substantially higher but as an adc, you are often either feeding your lane or being a non-factor in teamfights, or letting the game go too long (more on that later).

Your CS numbers are very low, work on that.

Your champ pool is bad for the current patch.  Vayne is also too hard a champ for you to play effectively as a Silver player.  Remember that champions are balanced around what pros can do, most of the time - so if you are playing a very high skillcap champion at a low elo, you are leaving a lot of that power on the table.  You'd see better results if you focused on a more faceroll champ like Lucian.

Your games seem to go very long most of the time, which suggests you don't understand how to properly capitalize on a won teamfight by pushing and/or securing objectives.  Granted you seem to be playing lategame champs like Vayne and Tristana, but the current meta isn't kind to those kind of carries.

Utilities - 2/3rd of your food budget (4-7%)

meds - these are all covered by our drug plans at work, but let's combine them together and say 1% a month

internet/phone/cable/netflix/hulu - 4-5%

Dining/movies - 1-3% depending on the time of year

* The first when I knew little about computers and was wanting to add an extra stick of ram to my computer.

I declined because even my former peasantry knew that was a rip off. Figuring I would youtube it, I took it home and saw my comp black screen. Luckily my roomie was a comp sci major, opened it up and saw the assholes purposely left my RAM unclasped (I assume so I'd freak out and take it to them). My roomie changed it in under 3 minutes for 2 steam games. $10 dollars total.

* I needed to change my harddrive, something I could easily do myself but I had serious surgery and could not lift more than 5lbs. I was driven to geek squad to see how much they would charge me. $200 for labor ALONE (not including the os they wanted to charge me for and the harddrive itself)! I looked them in the eye ""you know I could do this myself and I know for a fact you are asking way too much."" The asshole then tried going on about how they would look through my system 32 folder for viruses, spyware, bloatware, adware, ect. ""It's a new hard-drive. Why would any of that exist?"" He told me I could go somewhere else, so I told the next 3 customers in line he knew nothing about computers and just tried to hustle me.

eatgeeksleeprepeat,AskReddit,1390848731.0,"According to the CDC, pitt bulls are responsible for 66 bite-related fatalities from 1979-1998. German shepherds are responsible for 17. So if the term ""pitt bull"" encompasses 5 breed types (so 13.5 fatalities per breed), how does that make them more aggressive/dangerous than a German Shepherd? 

Also, no government or law enforcement agency is in charge of tracking or collecting this data. When asked why the state of Texas no longer tracks dog bite statistics, this is what they said:

""I’m sorry to report that this program has been discontinued. There was never a legislative mandate which required animal control agencies to submit reports on Severe Animal Bites. Although the Zoonosis Control Division highly encouraged all animal control agencies to voluntarily submit these reports, we would receive only 500 to 600 reports a year, and none of the major metropolitan areas (Amarillo, Brownsville, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Houston, Laredo, Lubbock, or San Antonio) participated. As I’m sure you can imagine, without data from these cities the information we did manage to collect was severely limited in scope. We completed a program review and realized that the information collected could not be proven to be scientifically representative of the entire state and that analysis of the small data set we did collect did not reliably reflect statewide trends.""

Here's an [infographic](http://www.1800petmeds.com/education/pit-bull-facts-and-myths.htm) created by 1800petmeds that illustrates a lot of the pitt bull misconceptions. It's way simpler than me laying it out, issue by issue."

While it's good to assess yourself and your life, pinpoint the changes you need to make and then work to make those changes- it's really something that you've got to do for yourself, not your boyfriend. If you're doing it for him, you're doing it for the wrong reason and it's not going to work.

Resenting someone who rejects you is natural. If I lived with that amount of rejection I'd resent him as well.

I sincerely hope that he's addressing the issues in your sex life by dieting and getting on a treadmill, not just by insisting you attend therapy.  If you don't want to give up sex, you don't have to. If you don't want to give up BDSM, you don't have to. 

My personal advice would be to let this one go. There's plenty of fish in the sea and it looks like you guys are not compatible. I'm submissive, and the worst thing I ever did was get into the bed of a narcissist. Don't go there, it's the road to hell."

blaghart,science,1390849532.0,"A thermal resevoir is a heat sink, some place to store heat energy.

Not entirely sure about the squeezing bit (thermo has always been tricky for me) but I believe it means that they're essentially adding pressure to a thermal resevoir to increase the energy difference between the two.

Everything in the universe is trying to reach thermal equilibrium, that is, it's trying to give off energy if it's too hot and take on energy if it's too cold.  this is the basis for the Carnot cycle, as one has a resevoir that is too cold and wants to absorb energy and a resevoir that is too hot and wants to give off energy.  They seem to be saying that by adding pressure to one of the resevoirs they can increase the difference in energy between the two resevoirs without adding significantly more energy (though I believe this is only on a quantum level, which is why it works...physics is screwy on a quantum level)

Basically the bigger the difference in temp between two things, the faster the energy moves, allowing more work to be done because greater quantities of energy are being moved.

This uses the above to get greater efficiency out of the carnot cycle without putting in an equivalent amount of energy necessary to normally raise the temperature (they're making it hotter without burning more stuff essentially)

Could be wrong though."

Don't count retail out. There are regulations on how business must treat pregnant employees (although small businesses are often exempt). They would not be able to fire you for being pregnant, or discriminate against you in any way. They may even be required to give you reasonable accommodations, although /r/babybumps would know more. I was lucky enough to not have to worry about any of that when I was pregnant, because I had a desk job and an understanding boss.

Might give some more jumping off points for discussion!](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1vgbkl/have_you_guys_seen_the_disney_movie_tangled/) 

&gt;My best friend and I were watching it when it first came out on DVD because we have very young daughters and it's a princess movie. Mother Knows Best came on. We were dumbstruck, and the first words out of her mouth were, ""Oh my god, it's your mom! It's her! She just blamed Rapunzel for upsetting her after gleefully threatening the plague would kill her! Holy shit, it's your mom!""

&gt;We watched the movie multiple times a day (toddlers!) for weeks, finding more and more things in common with my mom and Mother Gothel. It was cathartic and hilarious and the comeuppance at the end for Gothel was glorious.

&gt;Trying to sabotage her relationship with Flynn, demanding she never grow up and leave the house, claiming other people will only love Rapunzel for the things she can offer her, kissing HER HAIR to show affection (I only love you for what you do for me), digs to a completely healthy girl about her weight, sheltering her excessively and then claiming she's naive and inexperienced, calling her ditzy and vague while only allowing her access to a few books as though any lack of knowledge is Rapunzel's doing...
Rapunzel is a tragically good example of the GC. She's golden when she's obedient, and she's brought down any time she wants to grow up and be independent. Any time she has a mind of her own.

&gt;It went from freaking me out to being one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. We dramatically sing the Mother Knows Best song when I get off the phone with my mom.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,TrollXChromosomes,1390850795.0,"&gt;Why is it all on the women to pay for Plan B?

If you believe in ""my body, my choice"" then it's up to you to pay for it and to take charge of your own health instead of relying on a man to do it for you. Same goes for men: if they don't want kids, it's up to them to take steps to keep themselves from becoming baby daddies instead of just trusting that the woman's using birth control like she says she is. This is like a man wondering why he should have to pay for all his own condoms and why the woman should get a free pass.

&gt;While you should always be responsible about sex, it's like people completely forget it takes two and they share that responsibility.

That is the ideal way to make it work, but it seems to work better in a solid relationship and less well in a hookup. 

And again, as the one with the uterus, ultimately it has to be up to the woman to protect herself. If we want the right to determine what happens to an unborn child without any input from the man, then we need to be willing to pay out for whatever methods are required to keep ourselves from getting pregnant. Rights go hand in hand with responsibility. "

James_GAF,cordcutters,1390850917.0,"It may be that what I want isn't available. I'm not even sure what it would be called. At this point I'm not sure it's worth the investment to maybe drop basic cable for $12/month in savings so I'm looking for a solution with consistency that pays back in fairly short order.

&gt; It's a very expensive way to address a weak antenna problem.

I'm already looking at buying 2 digital converters or 2 TVs which would give me 4 discrete tuning devices. Add on a preamp, perhaps a distribution amp and I'll maybe achieve what I'm hoping with an investment between ~$200-a few hundred for TV replacements. Even if I do that there's several variables that may not get the results I want. Payback on investment at that point is near 15 months minimum. I'm not sure it's worth the bother and may just keep basic cable to fill the gaps.

&gt; Digital tuners today are a combination of analog RF electronics and digital software to decode the data stream. Differences in firmware software levels can make a difference even with the same tuner. Most of the time you can't change this, especially in TVs since it's burned into a chip.

Right. That's why I'm looking for a single tuning device that can service all outlets I assume with 4 or more internal tuners that I can control independent of one another. Maybe what I want doesn't exist. Maybe it does, that's what I'm trying to find out.

&gt; If you really want to go down this route, then build a whole house DVR using MythTV then distribute live TV &amp; recorded programs via IP to small set top boxes located at the TVs. This completely eliminates the variance that you describe.

You're right. That is expensive. It's near the solution I'd like, except for individual boxes at point of use. It would be an upgrade in some respects though I'm not sure the cost is worth the benefit or not."

How doesn't it equate??, they're both by their very definition protection against something which might happen. Global politics by it's very nature is unpredictable, nobody could have predicted the likes of WWI or the Arab Spring, you or I just don't know what's going to happen, and downsizing or getting rid of our military altogether just because *at this very moment* chances are low is incredibly short-sighted and naive.

How are they rarely used??, Right now we have troops on overseas missions in 13 different countries. Army EOD teams are called out at home almost every other day. The Air Corps are called out for Air Ambulance Missions just as frequently. The Navy are patrolling our waters 24-7-365. Again, how exactly are they rarely used??

Well right now, there is a threat from dissident republican/loyalist paramilitaries that shouldn't be ignored. We've all seen on the news how many hundreds of millions of euros worth of drugs were intercepted in our waters by the Navy, how many hundreds of millions more is going undetected??, and you can bet your bottom dollar in some incidents they are linked, as well as that there are daily incidents of poaching in our territorial waters, as well as many other incursions that violate out territorial integrity, which is a founding principal of the UN.

That would be my first hopeful fix. I've just not gone for it as there's no guarantee of sufficient results and I'd be looking at buying converter boxes as well introducing more variables. Maybe it would work, but even if it did perfectly it would take more than a year to pay itself back in savings. I'm not sure it's worth it for a maybe.

&gt; Option 2. Get a HD Home run. Hook it to the antenna and the network. Then put a device on each TV (roku, etc). And each roku can tune the HD Home Run. Additionally you would gain DVR functions.

That sounds like a good upgrade option. If I'm reading things right it's a dual tuner device and I'd need 2 of them to hit all 4 TVs. Is there a quad tuner version out there somewhere? Or a similar device?

I've been considering more Roku's. I only have 1 currently and love it. I'm not sure I'd want to rely on that for at least one of the lowest use outlets though.

Something like this is the nearest solution I've seen. If I could get a quad tuner device that doesn't require set top boxes of some kind it would be ideal."
BlueCarrotAntenna,czech,1390851702.0,"Oh don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to make you quit or discourage you! Just because a language is hard doesn't mean one shouldn't try; in fact I think it's all the more impressive that you're managing so far. :)

You are right that the amount of people learning Czech is small, but due to being half-foreign myself I've always been around quite a few of them, so I'm not a 100% typical Czech that isn't used to butchering of the language. When I was very small my mum didn't speak any Czech at all, but as years went by we gradually switched to it. In the end though, we landed at this hybrid-ish language where we call some things by non-Czech names because we're just used to referring to them that way. We only speak that way with each other, so it's a little bit funny I suppose. :) Still though, my mum will sometimes make obvious case-selection or conjugation mistakes. Such mistakes don't have equivalents in English because English has much simpler grammar. It's not the same as forgetting a word in English or misspelling something; it's also a mistake that a native speaker could never make. 

My mum also speaks English btw. She's been speaking Czech for 25 years, English for 10 and she finds English much easier. Just thought I'd throw it in there. :)

In the end I think my point is that acknowledging that a language is harder shouldn't depress you and doesn't mean that you should give up. In fact, it should be something you find encouraging because it means that mistakes are more than ok! When you still mess up that case in 10 years and someone points it out to you, you can just be like ""oh well, it's a tough language"" even if they do speak near-perfect English."

I think it's safe to say that easily the majority, if not the vast majority, of people masturbate. I also *hate* the term ""struggling with masturbation and/or pornography."" Masturbation is normal! Infants do it! Fetuses do it! Our closest evolutionary cousins do it all the time!

There is no harm in masturbation. The harm comes from people self-judging and having society-driven shame and guilt. The harm comes from places like COLDS."
temp9876,relationship_advice,1390851735.0,"I offered my husband a prenup.  He took it pretty well but was certainly shocked.  His family were rather offended.  I think the best way to approach it is just a neutral conversation about planning for the future.  Acknowledge that it is a touchy subject but you'd like to talk about it.  I prefer to frame a prenup not as planning for divorce, but putting your money where your mouth is.  I think it is better to make those promises up front while you're happy than when things are on the rocks.  In my case, I had a deal with my husband that he would support me through school, and then I would return the favor.  Realistically our living arrangement put him at a disadvantage if we separated before my education started to pay off.  With kids involved too, it seemed to me only fair if I put in writing the promises I had made to him.  I think presenting the possibility of a prenup that way, as something that I thought was in his best interest, really helped keep it non-threatening.  

I'm personally a big believer, I think everyone should have a prenup.  It's like writing a will while you're still young, or paying for life, disability, AD&amp;D or even employment insurance.  But it also (in my opinion) makes the wedding vows more meaningful, it's not just about the wedding, it's about building a life together and all of the realities that entails.

If she gets upset about the trust issue, which seems to me to be a common thing, point out that it is just as much about trusting yourself.  I don't trust myself not to change at some point in the next fifty years, maybe in a way that my partner won't like.  I certainly don't trust myself to be fair in dividing assets if the relationship has broken down.  

It might help to break it into more than one conversation, approach the subject, explain your reasons, and give her time to think about it before discussing specifics.  I don't think it will be an easy conversation either way, but good luck, it's an important one."

FeatherDie,relationship_advice,1390851838.0,"My opinions: 

1. Your girlfriend doesn't exacerbate your sex drive. You are very attracted to her and it makes you horny. 

2. It's normal for you to want to masturbate. Whether you feel the need twice a day or once a month is up to you and your body. 

3. Masturbation is a private thing that can have it's place in a relationship. If your girlfriend is uncomfortable with watching or participating without sex, I don't think it's unacceptable for you to respect her wishes. I hope she would return the favor for you.

4. Oral doesn't have to be a part of foreplay, it can be done in order to please one partner alone. Sex and oral also shouldn't be something that is owed to one's partner because you're in a relationship. If you want to ask for oral, that's something you both should work out. 

5. My partner's sexual gratification is not my responsibility, and neither is mine his. We are both responsible for our bodies and asking for what we need. If we want a happy sex life then it's up to us both to work on having a healthy relationship and fulfilling each other's needs. (obviously in the bedroom we both work towards satisfying the other person)

My advice:

If your partner has a lower libido than you do, then you guys need to work out something now while you're still figuring out how to live with each other. It's okay to be HL or LL, but if you want a healthy relationship you both need to compromise on it. You might not get all the sex you want all the time, and she will need to work with you on meeting your needs. I would have a discussion when you're not actively wanting sex from each other, as it relieves immediate pressure to act."

Are you fucking mental?

There is currently no counter play to these champions because of their ultimates, to argue that they are balanced is crazy right now.  The scaling on their abilities allow them to 1 shot champions.  Yesterday I 1-shot a fiddle sticks with a Q-E combo (1 auto on Lich Bane).  100 to 0 in 2 key strokes.  I had 4 items.  That's not supposed to happen, mind you I didn't suffer for doing that because I just ultied myself and walked away.  All their CC was blown and I survived.

Balancing them would be to tweak their scaling so that they don't get to this point, but there is almost no way to get to a happy medium with someone like Kassadin as you can see from the PBE."

Strategy is pretty important in the arena. Usually it takes me 2 attempts to beat someone, the first 1 is mainly to see what their defense consists of and the second one I've modified my strategy to beat their defense. 

Here's some ideas for different strategies to win on arena. 

1. Head to head: If they have all their heroes in one lane, and you think you can beat them, put all yours in the same lane and wipe them. 

2. If they have all their heroes in 1 lane, but you can't beat them. Put all your highest damage heroes in a different lane at the very front of the circle and try to race them to kill the base (I win a lot of matches with this one because of my high dps heroes). 

3. A lot of people split off some high DPS heroes like succubus and ninja into a separate lane from their main force. They want their main force to keep you busy while their DPSers go in and kill your base. Try sending your 5 heroes against just their separated guys, hopefully you can kill their DPS and whatever heroes you have left can then go to their base and out DPS whatever heroes they have left. (Probably the second most common way I win). 

4. The opposite of number 3. Put some tanky heroes and healers in a lane to catch as many of their heroes as you can, send your high DPS heroes down an open lane to kill their base. 

Here's some general tips for arena: 

1. You can place heroes in different positions within the starting circle! This is ***very*** important so that you can time heroes with different move speeds. Controlling what order your heroes get aggro can have a huge effect on fights. 

2. Level up your legendary champions over elite and ordinary, Always. They scale way better. Also have them consume slimes/other heroes so that their abilities level up. 

3. Look at the portrait of a person before you challenge them. The hero in their portrait is the highest level hero in the defense. 

For you personally OP, Both TG and GR are good legendaries to have, but I'd recommend leveling the reaper first. He's super slow so it takes a long time for him to get to the other side, but he does really great damage (I have one as well). I've actually had his ability win me matches before because he can kill heroes that aren't in the same lane as him. I always start him at the very front of the circle to cut down on travel time (and he's still always last to places). "

I used to work in the drive-through at Panda Express. Well one day we had an Indian customer pull up and place an order. Now, I'm from a fairly monochrome town, we're all white and due to the lack of culture exposure I couldn't understand for the life of me what this Indian dude was saying. 

So, I made an assumption. Usually when we get the Indian guys coming through the drive through they order white rice and double kung pao chicken.

So I went over and prepared it, it kind of sounded like he said white rice and double kung pao anyway, so that was probably it. I finish the order and reconfirm with him that I fulfilled the correct order. 

“Yes, yes may I have it now please.” So I say, “Sure guy, here you go have a nice day.” 

Then out of the corner of my eye, I see this guy reach into his coat pocket and reach into the box. I thought absolutely nothing of it as I went to go complete the other order. When I finally finished and got back to the window, I was expecting a new car to be there but the Indian man was still there. He looked angry now though.

I open the window and calmly ask him what the problem is. He points in his box, and I see the most fake looking cockroach I’ve ever seen sitting between a red pepper and a peanut.

""This is unacceptable I want refund!""

Still trying to keep my cool I tried to tell him that I SAW HIM PUT THE COCKROACH IN THE BOX. Moreover, that it was obviously fake. 

He gave me a frustrated look, and then drove off. I assumed that he went home but no, he parked his car and walked inside the building to speak with the manager. 

They began to get into a large argument and before I knew this Indian dude was demanding the manager give him the money back. My manager was pretty cool, but he didn’t have a spine. So he runs to the back and for the sake of conflict aversion he goes back and gets the money for the guy. 

He comes back and hands it to the Indian, but this only frustrated him more. The Indian pulled out the receipt looked at my manager and said, “Hey man, I paid 8.72 for this. Why did you only give me tree fiddy?”

But he totally backed down when he realized that my manager was 8-story-tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

keepfighting,changemyview,1390852618.0,"&gt;And there is good reason for that. One's feelings towards female promiscuity should range from neutral to negative, almost never positive. In the case of males, said feelings should range from neutral to positive. As a woman, it's not really hard to have 10-15 sexual partners in 1 year. All you have to do is fit through the door (and not sideways). As a male, this is quite difficult to accomplish. A male that can get 15 sexual partners in 1 year deserves respect, a female does not. That's not to say that she deserves to be shunned, unless she starts bragging about it, in which case she deserves all the flack she gets (this is why I said range from neutral to negative). But the fact that a female expects the same amount of respect as a male for doing absolutely nothing, except for being there, is just another example of female entitlement. Exception from the above constitute females that are ugly enough so that getting a partner actually requires compensating on their part, by putting in actual work (approaching people, trying to hold the conversation alive etc.).

I'm having the hardest time understanding any of this logic. It's so completely skewed I don't even know where to begin. Your entire argument falls apart however, when you realize that describing sex as some kind of conquest, in which adding tally marks is somehow respectable in any way shape or form, is absurd. This is how both male virgin shaming and female slut shaming came to be. 

How hard is it for a female to find a sex partner vs a male is completely irrelevant in terms of what is more ""respectable."" There is no good reason for slut shaming or for male bragging terms like ""player and stud."" "

rbaltimore,Parenting,1390852650.0,"I am a social worker and prior to becoming a stay at home mom, I was a child and adolescent therapist. I worked on an outpatient basis, but I moved into inptient, working in a residential treatment center. Sometimes adolescents need inpatient care. It is easier to get an accurate diagnosis when care providers have the ability to observe the child for more than 50 minutes at a time. I found that being able to observe my patients at any time of day for any duration made it so much easier to assess what was really going on. I had a patient who had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was in treatment (outpatient) for several years, and she just wasn't getting better. After two days in the residential treatment center (RTC), I knew why - she was actually bipolar type 1. Anti-depressants can make bipolar disorder more severe, triggering mania sometimes (unless mood stabilizers are also prescribed).

For my patients, being at an RTC meant that they could get direct care, from professionals, right as the problems were happening. Patients could learn and practice coping skills *in the moment*.

RTCs also provide respite for the families. You need a break. I can see in your post that you are worn down and at your breaking point. Your daughter is having a tough time. Sending your son to an RTC gives you all the ability to regroup, the knowledge that your son is getting help 24 hours a day, that he is getting social support from the other patients. Many parents like you feel that they are drowning, and with their child in inpatient care, they can finally come up for air.

An RTC is not an inpatient hospital. Those are for short term inpatient care and focus primarily on acute treatment for mental health problems. RTCs give that same kind of treatment, but they also provide psychosocial care, behavioral therapy, and the benefits of peer-to-peer relationships. They also provide family care and support.

You're not alone. You're not at a dead end. You don't have to resign yourself to a lifetime of heart break and you absolutely do not have to resign your son to a lifetime of this Herculean struggle. Call you son's therapist and meet with him (just you and your wife) to talk about inpatient options like this one. 

After working in an outpatient clinic and then an inpatient facility, I will never go back. This is where I was doing the most good. In fact, RTCs were the solution for not one but two of my very own cousins. Words can't express how grateful I am that my cousins moved across the country to stay in an RTC (different ones). The change for them and the change for my family has been remarkable. They didn't want to go, they fought it as hard as they could, but they came home glad they'd gone.

If you have any questions about inpatient treatment options, please message me. You don't have to live like this, I promise you that there are options."

clockworkgirl21,worldnews,1390852738.0,"Many medical associations worldwide discourage it, some stating it's a human rights violation, and the Swedish Pediatric Society even backs banning it, as does the German Pediatric Association.

Swedish Pediatric Society:

Circumcision of young boys for religious and non-medical reasons ought to be banned in Sweden. ""We consider it to be an assault on these boys,"" said Staffan Janson, chairman of the committee for ethical issues and childrens' rights. Children are unable to form a decision in the matter. Circumcision is an attack on boys' integrity. ""It's such a complicated and difficult question, but even so, we've decided that this is a procedure to be done away with,"" Janson said.""It's a mutilation of a child unable to decide for himself.""

Royal Australasian College of Physicians:

""Ethical and human rights concerns have been raised regarding elective infant male circumcision because it is recognized that the foreskin has a functional role, the operation is non-therapeutic and the infant is unable to consent. After reviewing the currently available evidence, the RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand."" ""The foreskin has two main functions. Firstly it exists to protect the glans penis. Secondly the foreskin is a primary sensory part of the penis, containing some of the most sensitive areas of the penis."" ""The potential harms include contravention of individual rights, loss of choice, loss of function, procedural and psychological complications. . . . A boy circumcised as an infant may deeply resent this when he grows older; he may want what he cannot have – not to have been circumcised. . . . The option of leaving circumcision until later, when the boy is old enough to make a decision for himself does need to be raised with parents and considered. . . . The ethical merit of this option is that it seeks to respect the child’s physical integrity, and capacity for autonomy by leaving the options open for him to make his own autonomous choice in the future.

Royal Dutch Medical Association:

""There is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene. Partly in light of the complications which can arise during or after circumcision, circumcision is not justifiable except on medical/therapeutic grounds. . . . Contrary to what is often thought, circumcision entails the risk of medical and psychological complications. . . . Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is contrary to the rule that minors may only be exposed to medical treatments if illness or abnormalities are present. . . . Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors conflicts with the child's right to autonomy and physical integrity. . . . Complications in the area of sexuality have also been reported as have extreme pain experiences in newborns causing behavioral changes which are still apparent years later. Similarly, the high social costs of circumcision as a result of complications have been cited. . . . The foreskin is a complex, erotogenic structure that plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts, such as penetrative intercourse and masturbation. The many attempts by men to restore their foreskins by mechanical or surgical means also contradict the idea that the foreskin is a useless part of the body.""

British Medical Association:

“The BMA does not believe that parental preference alone constitutes sufficient grounds for performing a surgical procedure on a child unable to express his own view. Parental preference must be weighed in terms of the child's interests. . . . The BMA considers that the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it. . . . Some doctors may wish to not perform circumcisions for reasons of conscience. Doctors are under no obligation to comply with a request to circumcise a child.”

What's more, international doctors protested the AAP's stance.

everythingismagical,AskWomen,1390852920.0,"This situation actually became a success story for me! I met this wonderful guy about 6 years ago, and although we were both involved with other people, I felt such an incredible attraction to him that I had always wished we had met each other before we began dating our respective SOs. Both of our relationships were volatile and destructive, characteristics that helped us to bond and become good friends. I never knew if he returned my feelings, and I never let on that I had them. After a year of friendship he transferred schools and we drifted apart.

Fast forward to a year ago: he randomly visited the city I now live in, and we instantly connected again. Plus, this time we were both single! We started talking, which quickly progressed to visiting each other, and then to dating. After only three months he got a transfer and we moved in together.

I know that he is the love of my life, but I also know that if I had pursued him six years ago when we first met, we would have torn each other apart emotionally, both from the remnants of our respective bad relationships, and because we both had far more self-destructive tendencies back then.

But the more important difference is that you can't stream games like you can stream movies. You have to download and purchase for the same amount of money. If you only buy games online, then you're going to be paying full-price every time. There will be no pre-owned sales and what affects me more is having to deal with download time. I'm pretty cheap and have internet through a company that will shut off a device's connection if a fourth device gets on the network.

Anyway, we kept on being poor and Christmas rolls around. Everyone is unwrapping their presents and being happy and jolly, mostly used toys and whatever but back then me and my sister had great imaginations.

I get a toolbox and a block of wood + a couple of nails, which is without a doubt the greatest gift I have ever gotten. Every single tool was slightly rusted or bent or used in a noticeable way, but there was this screwdriver that was BRAND NEW! It had a handle of rubber, it was shining, it was flat and motherfucking perfect. So I'm screwing screws in to a block of wood for fun, because that's the kind of I considered to be fun, when I get it in to my head to pick up the screwdriver, with the flat end pointing upwards from my hand. So I'm running around being happy as a little motherfucker like I could be, when all of a sudden I trip. The screwdriver went right between my eyes, missing both of them but oops.

JIVEprinting,homegym,1390853682.0,"Look up the discussion of 5/3/1 on the /r/weightroom FAQ if you like, it has quite a few deficiencies.  Mainly, though, it is an advanced program.



Really the only reason it has any relevancy at all is it was one of the first advanced programs to be marketed online.  Guys who had exhausted linear progression didn't know what else to do, and 5/3/1 can get them gaining again.  But that's about the only thing you can say in its favor.


SS works great and sets a number of good precedents for beginners.  Squats are the beginning and cornerstone of every workout; this prevents whining and neglect because if you start horsing around with running, bench press, and bicep curls, then squats are very hard and you don't want to do them.  But if they're the normal program, you enjoy the results from them and expect to work hard constantly.


I have discovered two key distinctions over time with SS: its main strength is being *easy*: not wimpy workouts, but easy to follow.  All facets of the program are simple, objective, and quantifiable.  Numerous considerations are efficiently programmed into a program that you could literally write out on one of your fingers.


The other thing is- having wasted thousands of hours over the last two years learning everything I could find about training- is that SS actually contains every single thing worth knowing.  Until you are lifting three times your bodyweight and want to lift more, then all the myriad articles and information in the marketplace cannot add anything more to your training ouvre than SS put there in the first place.  This information is not only adequate to the purpose, but complete and reliable as well.



My phone died right as I went to edit the comment above, but was going to add that barbell complexes are the other preeminent training choice available.  They have no equal in fat loss or conditioning, and share none of the liabilities of traditional cardio either.  Wendler is a decent resource for barbell complexes (albeit with lots of plugging expensive supplements.)


Mastery of the basic barbell lifts translates immediately into doing complexes too, so there's that.


A person note about barbells: the reason they work so well is they apply variable resistance to the body in exactly the manner that the body is designed to meet them.  There is no more direct training possible of the skeletal muscle system, indeed the entire physiology and everything we define as fit.


I went from a sedentary weak nerd to the strongest guy I know in six months of SS.  I put on size so fast that every time I laid down to go to sleep, the bed felt different than before because I had added tangible muscle that day.  Without doing any cardio I was two-thirds in shape already, and when I started training for endurance I got up to speed in about a week and left everybody else in the dust because I was stronger.  And this was the dude who always got picked last!  I was stronger, bigger, and tougher than guys who'd been in the gym for ten years.


People joke around like Rip is Jesus and SS is the Bible, but there really is an excellent comparison there.  This one book bridges the gap between privileged enlightenment and groping in the darkness.


For your evaluation, just compare the mechanical instructions for any of the exercises: Wender supplies 1/3 - 2 pages, Rip an average of sixty."

You don't need to clean house before they get there, you don't need to feed them or entertain them while they're there.  You're letting them into your nuclear family for a few weeks, that means you accept a little more familiarity and lower expectations a bit.  If you don't think they will understand or expect that treatment then by all means, set the expectations in advance (have your husband do it).  But embrace the whole ""it takes a village"" mentality and accept help where you can get it!  Give them clean sheets and otherwise let them help you catch up around the house.  It really helps to have an extra body to help with cooking and facilitating naps sometimes.

It's best if they have swatches available directly on their website (Shiro, most of the time) along with the products but I do look up swatches occasionally. My favorites are the types that swatch everything in one row (Silk Naturals does this) so I can see the color differences between each shade (especially helpful if the product is nuanced). 

I read through some of the comments and you mentioned that you've not got a great camera. There are some users and bloggers here that have mentioned they would do swatches if sent products. If you do decide to go this route, my favorite [swatches](http://imgur.com/a/OOyOV) are always done by /u/thegreenbasket who has mentioned she'd be willing to do swatches before! :) 

Aside from swatches (which is the reason I'd make an order in the first place), I think customer service is important (the reason I'd continue to place orders). Some things that I look for:   

* Does the order ship within their stated turn-around-time?  
* How long does it take them to respond to any questions/messages I send?  
* If there is a defect with the product, what actions do they take to fix it?  
* Are they responsive to customers wants/needs (e.g. if multiple customers express trouble with the formula of one product would they change it)? 

Other things that I think are a nice touch and do encourage me to continue placing orders (but I wouldn't stop if they weren't included):  

* Do they include a handwritten note on the packing slip?  
* Do they include free samples?

iliriel227,anime,1390854084.0,"This list will contain some leftovers from last season.

**Top Tier**

*Golden Time*
I am a sucker for a good romance, and this show has definitely got me by the balls, ever since the new OP released a part of me has dreaded watching each new episode because I truly just want a happy ending for Banri and Koko.

*Log Horizon*
This is my first MMO Anime, and seeing how divisive SAO was, I was hesitant to even try one, not to mention that having played a LOT of WoW in particular, as well as Everquest and LOTRO, I went into it figuring that it would just be an action anime, and it wouldn't be able to convey the cool things about MMO's. Boy was I wrong, Politics, entire episodes about the in-game economy, group play dynamics, and on top of all that, it let the action speak for itself, while focusing on the characters. I find myself genuinely surprised, and I look forward to this as well.

*Kill la Kill*
Initially, I was merely following this anime just because most everyone else was, however, the plot has recently heavily engaged me, and Satsuki may be one of my favorite anime characters ever. Although she seems more like the protagonist to me, its almost like ryuuko is the villain.
*Nobunagun*
I'm not really sure what about this anime draws me to it, but i'm willing to sit along for the crazy ride with a smile on my face.

*Witch Craft Works*
Sometimes its interesting to see a protagonist who is so supremely overpowered compared to her enemies that its comical, it has an interesting premise, and some interesting animation. My only real complaint is her breasts seem to grow and shrink a lot.

*Sekai Seifuku*
A little girls quest for world domination is successful, and we, the viewers get to find the answer to ""How in the fuck did she do that?"" the show gets a pass on intrigue alone, but its interesting characters really carry it across.
*Strike The Blood*

I shouldn't like this nearly as much as I do, its a harem vampire anime about the power of friendship *Are you fucking kidding me?* Yet I find myself interested by the story, and curious as to where they will take it by the end of the season.

*Mikakunin de Shinkoukei*
Grandpa dies, then suddenly. *A Wild Fiance Appears.* The premise opens the floodgates for comical hilarity as long as you don't take the premise too seriously, im just hoping that Bluehair-kun(i don't remember his name) strengthens as a character soon, theres some potential there, but I need to see more action by him in particular.

*Nisekoi*
I'm  actually curious where they are going to take this, but again it's a romance, therefore I must watch. I do hope that they don't let the gang situation be a vehicle for the entire shows plot, and instead, move on to other things.

*Chuunibyou S2*
I feel like the only one who is enjoying this more than the first season (and I enjoyed the first season a lot) though I do miss touka.

*Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha*
My biggest surprise for the new season, the best, yet most vague description I can offer is that this anime has heart, it has soul, much in the same way that non non biyori did. At the end of each episode (so far) I feel healed, just like non non biyori, too bad its only 10 episodes long.

**Middle Tier**

*Tokyo Ravens*
I'm not really sure why i'm still watching, theres been a couple points where I thought the story might get engaging, but it has always fell pretty flat, at this point i'm just watching it to finish, since I have watched most of it, I might as well get through it. It's a pretty infuriating watch, because it feels like the anime could be interesting, but it just isn't.

*Sakura Trick*
It's a cute yuri show with some fan service, but it isnt particularly resonating with me, I think what I want is a yuri Toradora! or Clannad. I want a real romance, that said, Sakura Trick executes what it wants to pretty well, and I'm still watching it. 

*Tonari no Seki-kun*
It's short so I watch it every week, but there isn't much that is really good or bad about it, its decidedly mediocre.

*Magical Warfare*
It might be interesting, hard to say, I dont hate it.

**WTF Is This Shit Tier**

*ImoCho*
Horriblesubs has it right, its a shitty sister manga adaptation, after 4 episodes it went from meh, it could be funny to, oh my god when will it stop. I think this will be one of the very few anime I drop.

**Not Sure Yet**

*Space Dandy*
I am desperately trying to find out why this is hyped, I don't think the humor is really resonating with me, I see that it's silly, but i'm just not laughing, ill give it a few more episodes. Oh who am I kidding Ill watch them all then forget about it, that or love it dearly and miss it when it is gone. 

*Robot Girls Z*
I'm not sure whats going on with this one, i haven't seen mention of it beyond the first 3 episodes, but I really enjoyed what I saw, I'm just not sure that theres more coming.

*Noragami*
It teeters between interesting and boring with each episode, I'm not sure where they are taking this, hopefully we get some direction soon."

There is, of course, a question of whether the Arians, Modalists, and the like can claim the same lineage.  The Arians definitely seem to have been considered an innovation when they appeared, so I'd guess they weren't around in apostolic time.

When people say things like this I already grow suspect.  Jesus clearly had some pretty heavy doctrinal disagreements with Jews of his time.  To base your whole argument on the notion that he was Jewish and must therefore have agreed with the Jews is bizarre.  Reverend Sun Yung Moon was Christian, but he certainly didn't end up teaching Christian doctrine.

&gt;and was confused with god by mostly pagan converts. 

Can you demonstrate any ""great apostasy"" in the early church?  This is also a notion I am very suspicious of.  The argument always seems to boil down to ""These people who knew the apostles disagree with me, so the early church was wrong."""

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390854410.0,"I don't know how to tell you how to fix it, when you've been communicating clearly.

My husband and I used to have (sometimes still do) have issues over initation.  When I initiate forcefully, I can have sex pretty much whenever I want.  But I don't want to initiate all the time, my ideal would be initiating about 30% of the time, right now we're closer to 50/50, which is acceptable to me. 

Part of the problem is that my husband and I are both, by our nature, a bit more sexually submissive, although he's come to the point where he genuinely enjoys being dominant.  I can too, but I don't enjoy it/want to do it as often as he'd probably like.  I mistakenly kind of assumed when we got together that he was more dominant than he actually is because he literally couldn't keep his hands off me during the NRE phase of the relationship.  When that wore off, it was kinda like ""um, what happened?""  He's naturally wired to want to please me during sex more than think about his own sexual satisfaction (which is the only reason he started trying to be more dominant anyway - because he knew I needed it).   Maybe your husband is similar to mine?  He might be uncomfortable discussing sex because he is uncomfortable with the fact that he is less dominant than both culture tells men to be and as much as you want him to be.  

One thing that helped was talking honestly about our different ways of initiating.  I'd feel hurt and rejected if I went out of my way to look nice or show him a sexy bra I was wearing and he didn't respond by initiating, because to me I already WAS initiating.  He felt the same way because he'd do little things that I took as being cuddly or cute and had no idea that he was initiating.  We're both a lot better about being clearer and more direct when we're initiating, which has helped a lot.

The other thing that has helped was scheduling sex and doing a 30 day sex challenge.  Since we're both into it, it's taken the pressure off initiating for both of us.  However it sounds lke that isnt working for you because he feels free to ignore the sex schedule if you don't initiate.  He's not holding up his end of the bargain.

I know you've talked and talked but I think you need to have a ""come to Jesus"" talk, as in, ""For this relationship to work long term, you have to meet me halfway with initiating.  The responsibility for sex cannot be entirely on my shoulders.  It's unfair under any circumstances but also that just isn't how my libido operates!  I need to see real results from you"" and then set your limits.  Maybe continue having scheduled sex but tell him every other time, he has to initiate.

If he doesn't take this seriously and doesn't make a change, he's not serious about wanting to improve your sex life."

If you were to, say, eat a small but carb-loaded snack (a dessert, some mashed potatoes, a piece of candy, whatever), the glucose will hit your bloodstream much faster and in a much larger quantity and can help trigger your cravings for it. Carbs give you a rush. I don't know if a small slip up will set you back ""many days"" - everyone's recovery time is different.

Jess_than_three,IAmA,1390854772.0,"Speaking from an anthropology background, the definition we were taught regarding language was actually pretty simple: it requires the use of symbols, rather than signs - the difference being that symbols are arbitrary, whereas signs are fixed. 

So for example, we discussed a primate species that had a specific call for ""food"", and another to signal I think snakes, and another for like, I don't know, maybe a predatory cat? But the key thing is that each situation required a different response - come get this food, climb a tree to escape, whatever - and each call always elicited that specific response. 

By contrast, language uses symbols, which have no fixed connection to the reference. The word ""pan"" could refer to a cooking implement, or to a type of food, or to something else entirely. 

So I guess the question is - within any given species of corvid, do you ever see:

* One type of call used in response to one thing in one group, but a completely different thing in another group? (Ie, one ""word"" with different meanings for different populations) 

* One stimulus prompting completely different calls in different groups? (Ie, different populations using separate ""words"" to refer to the same meaning) "

You see the same thing in horror movies too, generally women have just as strong of leads as men (well, the more recent ones, obviously if you go back further in time like before 1980ish, this will not be the case).  Some awesome ones that come to mind are: ""Let the right one in"" ""Inside"" (&lt;- pretty fucked up) ""Martyrs"" (&lt;- even more fucked up).  In movies like these, obviously the lead female shows a shit ton of emotion, but so do the men.  Horror films wouldn't be as great if no emotions were shown.  I mean take SAW for example.  It wouldn't be so effective if the men and women acting didn't show such extreme emotions.

I kind of went off on a movie tangent .-. Well, fuck knows why women have strong leads in horror stuff while they're such crap in others like shooter stuff.  There's always that claim that it's more ""realistic"" if men are represented in it, but there are so many other examples where women are leads and it's just as realistic.  One could also claim that more men are interested in them than women, but really, we all know that's bs - if it was more marketable to women (stronger female leads) women would be more interested.

There's a decent prog metal scene with bands like Protest The Hero, Between The Buried And Me and such but most of the new sounds coming out of music are electronic since that means a much bigger range of sounds and has had less time to be explored as of now.

In terms of psychedelia there are obviously still people making music based off of trips and other such drug related experiences but I believe it's more toned down now. Hip-hop producers such as Madlib and I think El-P have mentioned shrooms in interviews if I'm remembering correctly. 

The first half of Old by Danny Brown had a few songs with psychedelic influences. Besides that I'd think of Portugal. The man, Animal Collective and its members, Flying Lotus, Flatbush Zombies.

The closest English approximation without using foreign sounds (like ""kh"") would be ""haam"", but saying it like the meat seems to be not-uncommon, at least if dictionary.com is to be believed.

Data was unable to naturally reproduce as well, and won the right as a living person capable of choosing his own destiny. The fact that Tuvix's decision was removed from him regarding his own life was wrong.  Then Janeway didn't take the recommendation of her medical officer, which on medical matters outranks her. (The Doctor was just as much as new life as Neelix, and for a while in the show was as well treated like a lesser form). Now could you say that Janeway made a difficult choice for a crew in desperate situation? Maybe... but the episode never really delves into that. The characters show no remorse for what they do to Tuvix, and it really isn't spoken of anymore (not that I'm aware of at least, I'm only on season 3).

Is it possible for you to switch meds?  You may not be able to turn your libido on while you're nursing, but you can still make an effort to please him via handjobs and blowjobs a few times a week.

For the psychological stuff, in addition to therapy, you should check out the sex-positive movement.  Sex-positivity really helped me get over an abusive sexual history where enjoying sex ""too much"" caused me to feel a lot of shame and anxiety.  The ""Good Vibrations Guide to Sex"" is an awesome starting place that is non-judgemental and constantly reinforces the idea that a happy healthy relationship to sex is everyone's birthright.  Pretty much any book by Good Vibes press will be helpful.

Do you (or did you) masturbate?  Read erotica or watch porn? Try to start, especially once you finish nursing.  Buy a vibrator (or 5) - keeping in mind that if you don't like a certain toy, it doesn't mean you don't like vibrators.  There's a vibe out there for (almost) everybody.  Learning what you like and what turns you on and doing it regularly is really important to maintaining a libido and being a good sexual partner.

You have a cool concept here and obviously are passionate about the idea. Your question is, 'how do I translate this into a story that people could enjoy.' Some authors might answer by saying, 'dive right in.' Just follow your gut and your simple ideas and let your instincts guide you. Others might give you the suggestion that you use a storyboard and plan out your story. Come up with characters and their backgrounds, develop desires and some sort of plot. From this break it down into scenes or chapters or what have you. From there you can create rough drafts and expand and edit and cut, have a freind read it and give you advice and then edit some more.

If you are real serious about writing, do some research about writing. Google search Joseph Campbell. Pick up Stephen King's On Writing. And start practicing. Build the habit to write an hour before work every day. Since your focusing on non-fiction, google that. Track down and talk to some of the experts (doctors, neuroscientists?) Talk to people who have had similar experiences. Read non-fiction. (I love Jon Krakauer- Into Thin Air) You have a thousand avenues to go down. There is a lot of right paths to follow.

 If you stay passionate and work hard at the project you can tell your story. With a lot of pratice and skill and luck, a lot of people may one day read it.

Other races are as represented as they choose to be. (but makeup is expensive and difficult so surprise surprise, guess what you see most of?)

The Federation is largely in a state of perpetual peace. They sure as hell aren't declaring war. The TNG era was exceptionally peaceful, as was Kirk's time. The worst were border skirmishes. The Cardassian war (while huge for them) was nothing but border skirmishes from the perspective size the Federation.

BS on ""unless you're military"" you can't travel. People travel all the time. Not always by transporter, but so what? When you're traveling several light years, does it really matter if you beam up to your ship or take a shuttle?

The Federation believes in self determination. If frontier borders change, and you choose to die rather than relocate, they aren't going to force you. But yeah, the federation is so awful because why? Because they found a peaceful solution that trades minor inconvenience for saving lives? How atrocious.

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390856031.0,"Personally, I do think that a mixture between women being weaker/it being ok for women to be weaker (and most horror games thrive on weakness, even if the character is let's say a capable or resourceful fighter within her universe, in a comparative video gaming context a horror game wants you to feel weak and out of your depth =&gt; even if the protag wins in the end the point is that it has to feel unlikely) and for men to channel their fear through them is the reason why there are so many of them. It doesn't explain all of them, but imo it explains why it is more frequent than in other genres. 

I also agree that the sexual appeal plays a much, much larger role in horror movies compared to horror games. 

Horror games seems to really love young girls though, both on the protag and on the antagonist side; sure movies do as well, but percentage wise it seems to be even stronger in games. I wonder if one contributing factor could be that it being a game frees you from needing an actress who is of that age in real life. Even if they are not more frequent there is a lot more you can let them do. 

I'm not sure whether Let's Players like Pewdiepie necessarily go against the human condition argument, since it can be argued that them expressing fear is supposed to be a sort of amusement/is supposed to be ridiculous because it is ""out of character"" for a guy. Or that maybe guys live through him vicariously because he does/can express it so freely. 

That said horror, is a pretty damn great genre, regardless of what reason might have triggered or facilitated the wide spectrum of female characters. Especially like your point about female antagonists and the interplay between female protags and antags. 

ETA: I'd also like to give a shoutout to horror games that alternate between male and female protagonists within the same game, such as Eternal Darkness, Illbleed or I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream. "

I have a compact SUV with ""all season"" tires, this Christmas Eve we went to my sister in law's place in a tiny town an hour away from Syracuse (and they had a Danish guy over, who lives in Brazil, who was so happy it was snowing!), and it snowed pretty damn hard.

ahhh_ennui,electronic_cigarette,1390856623.0,"The Aerotank base will really help - I wish they had it in mini size, too. :)

I don't know if this helps, but... I'm a 43-year-old biddy who has zero mechanical aptitude, and am painfully clumsy. I'm rebuilding my ProTanks with Kanthal and organic cotton (from cotton balls). Nothing fancy, and I am not trying to be clever with my builds - I don't mind the extra fuss, and I love the improved taste and more customized experience overall. But if you're happy with the stock heads, that's great too! Whatever keeps you off tobacco. :)

But when you pop a coil on one of your stock heads, I do recommend you give rebuild a try (don't throw out your old heads - everything but the coil is reusable). Rip Trippers' video got me started, just to get an idea what it's like. It took me a few tries to get the hang of it.

All it takes is a multimeter (I just use my MVP, though, to make sure the resistance is at my sweet spot between 1.7 and 2.1 ohms), some Kanthal (I have 30 gauge), a mandrel (I use a 1/16 drill bit) to wrap the Kanthal around, and organic cotton balls. Tweezers and a small butane torch help. Also, because I am so very ancient: reading glasses, a decently sized table (I tend to drop all the little bits), and good light.

I typically do 6 or 7 wraps around the drill to get the coil I like. I can build one in about 5 minutes, give or take. 

Anyway, it's not too difficult. It's just an extra thing you can do to further enhance vaping. Definitely not a requirement. If you do, get Kanthal in bulk from a non-vape store (you should be able to find 100' for +/- $7 - vape stores tend to sell a few feet for a few bucks, in my experience)."

There are forms of birth control that do not use hormones. I have been using a diaphragm for about 8 years...it's really effective when used properly, it won't mess up your hormones and make you feel like crap, and it's very affordable. Sadly, they no longer sell diaphragms here in Canada so when mine dies I'm going to have to try something else - probably the FemCap (another barrier method).

&gt;Female empowerment does not mean men are absolved of all responsibility.

Of course it doesn't. But where was your responsibility for your own health in all this? You don't use hormonal bc and so you put all the responsibility for preventing pregnancy on a guy you hardly know - don't you see what a bad idea this is, for precisely the reason that you're here making this post today?? You can't leave your safety in anyone else's hands...I guarantee you that you care way more about your own wellbeing than *anyone* you hook up with will. Don't leave it up to anyone else. Condoms break. People are unreliable, as you unfortunately found out. 

&gt;not denying women the use of barrier methods.

Condoms aren't the only kind of barrier method!!! 

&gt; Empowerment does not mean it's on me if he uses the condom improperly. That was his decision.

Empowerment means that you don't stake your ""I do not want to have a baby"" entirely on his ability to use a condom properly. It means that the first line of defense against unwanted pregnancy is *yours*, and him using a condom is a secondary method of protection rather than the primary one (at least, if we're talking about a hookup that you shouldn't trust with that responsibility...it's different if you're in a committed relationship and know the person well).

&gt;I don't think feeling like shit constantly is something I owe myself, but that's just me.

I don't want you to feel like shit. I want you to be safer next time and not trust someone else to protect you. 

&gt;Why are you defending this dude?

Not once have I defended him. Everything I've said about him iindicates the scorn I feel for him. 

&gt;You're acting like I'm the one who saw the condom break and did nothing. 

I'm trying to help you see that it never has to happen again, and that you can protect yourself more reliably than just hoping the condom doesn't break and that the dude you're with is honest. Pregnancy is hard. Being a mom, while the most epic adventure I've ever had, is hard. It's too important for you to leave it in his hands instead of yours. "

Yep, again with the ""lying Israeli right wing are actually truth tellers and everything they say is based in fact"".

I think they're just a sloppy bunch of sociopaths who think that ""dirty Arabs"" are intrinsically inferior, and they know with certainty that whatever they do, they'll always have people like you-- as well as the heads of Jewish communities worldwide-- backing them up and accusing anyone who says different of ""anti Semitism"" or spreading lies about the Israelis.

If anything, I see a reverse correlation in that children who act out are very often not punished or disciplined at home. 

Again, your argument could be used for any form of punishment. Should we refrain from giving children ""time out"" for fear they will forbid their peers from playing? 

To answer your question, no it is not okay for a child attempt to use parental discipline tactics on another child. This does not just apply to physical forms of punishment. "

I guess you can't read so well, eh.

How does ""people consider it an issue"" translate to ""it's not an issue""?

We just don't take the laughable Israeli/pro-Israel position of ""the Arab nations are scum, see how great the Israelis treat the Palestinians"" because that position is detached from reality and is intertwined with hatred of the Palestinians and all the Arabs.

&gt; Yeah. No wonder you quote-unquote Anti-Semitism. Case closed, ""bud"".

Sorry, but stating a fact isn't ""anti Semitism"". I get that German pro-Israelis are more hysterically obsessed with ""rooting out anti Semitism"", and I really don't know whether to laugh or cry when you see it in action.

I could care less about spurious, hysterical accusations, anyways-- as an anti-Zionist of ethnic German and Polish stock, at least partially, you can bet that all sorts of idiots throw that my way.

&gt; Nah, I was just having fun with that one. Joke's obviously lost on you, though

You are a joke, I admit. I don't see how ""being impartial"" is a joke, but maybe to the ridiculous pro-Israelis it is.

&gt; Wanna know what your main problem is? You just assume too much. And you're not good at it. A shame you deleted your comment about me hating ""Turks"" (NEWS FLASH: most of them actually want to be called Germans). 

That's one of the things German pro-Israelis do, with Israeli approval. Pretend that the Turks in Germany are incapable of success and that any problems they have are only their fault.

Stands to reason that you'd think the same way as so many of your compatriots-- assumption in this regard most often doesn't end up being inaccurate, since so many Germans that are pro-Israel are incredibly loud-mouthed about it.

Rank: High Level Science Officer

Expertise: Genetic Storage and Viral Weaponry

Weapon of choice: Tranquilizers

Favorite attack move: Injecting alien specimens with high doses of live viral infectious agents, then sending them merrily on their way.

What do your aliens look like?

Due to my undying hatred of zombie movies, my aliens resemble only the shambliest of zombies. 

What am I doing to stop the ~~zombie~~ alien invasion?

I head teams working in storage and catalogue of all earth life. There is no telling how many species will be wiped out in the onslaught. I also oversee the development of viral weaponry designed to infect and wipe out the alien races with no backlash on humankind.

James_GAF,bodyweightfitness,1390857880.0,"Typical top speed for a treadmill is only 10 MPH or 6 min/mile, which isn't sprint speed for most people. That's best speed a 1:30 400M which is the longest of the track sprints and further than typical HIIT. You're looking at 100m to 200m range to do proper Tabata sprints. Do you have access to something faster or is 10MPH really pushing your physical limits?

Treadmills are not that well suited to HIIT either as the acceleration and deceleration times make a Tabata unwieldy. Jumping off of and onto is a risky maneuver to get around the treadmill's shortcomings, but I strongly recommend against it less you'd like to go crashing off the back likely injuring yourself. You'll really need a track or something instant like a bike to train at that kind of intensity.

What are you trying to get out of your sprint workouts? A proper track program that mixes HIIT, full recovery repeats, moderate recover repeats, pyramids and middle distance work is what I usually integrate into my running seasons. I've aged enough I can't do a pure sprinters workout anymore, but those are geared purely for peaking performance at a specific distance. What are your goals?

Clearwire deployed WiMax several years ago. 2010 is probably accurate for the WiMax completion. LTE is being deployed by Sprint. Sprint is actually completing the work. They're approximately 3 months behind because of fiber providers not being able to keep up with Sprint. Sprint only has a few thousand towers left to upgrade at this point. They're only really waiting on backhaul. Rural areas will take longer but the towers in Champaign, IL have been upgraded they're just waiting on a faster Internet connection to be able to turn on LTE. "

Neebat,AskReddit,1390857947.0,"If you can't talk about kinky sex, then there's a good chance you're not talking about vanilla sex.  And if you're too afraid to talk about it, you never know if you're actually doing it right.

To put it more concretely:  How do you know your partner isn't into the kinky stuff if you and your partner don't actually know how it works enough to discuss it?

I've seen too many people who still think you need 3 hours of douching to do anal sex.  Your own preferences could be based on nothing but myths and superstitions if you don't educate yourself.  And if myths and superstitions limit what you can talk about with your partner, then your partner is missing out too.

Metaphor: How do you know that vanilla is your favorite ice cream if you've never had chocolate?

TLDR:  Vanilla ice cream is awesome.  I tried chocolate.  I don't like it at all.  But cinnamon ice cream is worth seeking out!"
