POGtastic,TumblrInAction,1388868766.0,"&gt; The proportions of nonmarital births varied widely among population groups. In 2011, these proportions were 17% for Asian / Pacific Islander births, 29% of non-Hispanic white births, 53% for Hispanic births, 66% of Alaska Native births, and **72% for non-Hispanic black births**. These proportions were essentially unchanged from 2010.

Neebat,technology,1388868807.0,"I disagree that it will lower demand, but I know a lot of my fellow advocates for driverless cars agree with you.

If I could keep working or playing while on the road, it would change my life.  I would put at least 10, maybe 50 times as many miles on my car.  I would need new cars much, much more often.

Reducing the peripheral costs associated with a product will increase the demand, not decrease it.  Driverless cars eliminate a ton of costs associated with travel:

1.  The need to stop doing what you're doing to drive.
2.  The cost / need for insurance.
3.  The cost of fuel (because driverless cars won't be in a hurry.)
4.  Parking costs / time wasted.

People claim that automated taxi fleets will be a bigger influence, but I say that's exaggerated.  I could already take a taxi if I wanted to leave most of my stuff behind.  I don't, because a parked car is doing its other job:  It's a very personal locker that keeps my belongings close to me."

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388869721.0,"&gt;Why is college tuition so high in the US?

Relative to where?

A foreign student in Canada and we charge about 22-23k for tuition for regular programmes (engineering is a bit more, medicine a lot more, and private business schools absurdly more).   That's roughly the break even point.  Domestic tuition might be 3-11k depending, but the rest is made up for by the province.  European counties have comparable costs but it's offloaded to the government more.  


The US is a rich country per capita, that makes the costs of everything a bit more than developed countries  like Canada, the UK, France, Germany, the rest of northern europe and that sort of thing.  And professors are expensive, the offers I've been getting for starting faculty are 70-85k and (depending on the exact position), which is quite low compared to industry offers (120-140 ish) but with better benefits.   Faculty of course also get increases in pay as time goes on, so a mid to senior faculty member is easily in the 120 range.  

The US also has this odd vicious cycle, because tuition is so  expensive out of pocket they need more money in aid for people who are brilliant but poor, as a result it drives up tuition costs for everyone else.  

Oh and if your university 'provided' health insurance as part  of your tuition that adds costs too.

AssociationFootball,Guitar,1388869789.0,"One thing i did that worked OK, was i cut a couple of small wedges out of wood and jammed them between the bridge and body underneath the cover where the springs are.  When you tune down your e-string it will stop your bridge from moving.  Obviously this will not allow you to use your whammy bar. 

Another thing you can do, i know steve vai does it for his live stuff, is get a pitch shifter pedal and drop the pitch a major second.  This will get you down to a D on the E string, if your playing off of tabs you just have to remember everything would be a major second low, so youd have to play everything two frets higher than tabbed except the chords on the e-string, where you would play them as tabbed on the root note and then the normal barre  / power chord formation.  

EDIT: I got overly excited to answer you post and didn't read it all.  If you're trying to tune down all the strings proportionally, then a pitch shifter pedal would be a good solution without even having to move your fingers around compared to the tab.

You need to calculate shadows from each light source using one of a collection of different techniques, all of which are really expensive.  

Doing static shadows isn't so bad, because you can precompute stuff, but real time shadows on a lot of moving stuff is quite tricky.  

While there's active research on shadowing techniques constantly going on, a lot  of it is half hearted, eventually we'll switch to ray tracing which does shadows properly as a natural consequence of modelling light, but ray tracing is still too expensive computationally to do  well.

I would argue against that.  The internet, while powerful in its ability to transmit any news instantaneously, also poses two major problems to obtaining knowledge.

1) It's overwhelming capacity makes it easy for useless data to crowd out important data.  Essentially, noise.  As a person, I have a limited capacity to take in information, and when I'm distracted by facebook and twitter updates, I spend less time on real, important, time-sensitive information.

2) The consolidation and centralization of information made possible by the internet also carries a great risk.  Whatever entity, be it the media or the government, that can impose a bottle neck on the flow of information can more easily manipulate the everyday person.

Remember, Pixel made the game by himself in 5 years, starting in 1999. You say that it was trying to ""emulate"" an era, but the game was made largely around the era where, as you say, sound design WAS limited to the hardware.~~

That being said, I agree that some of songs lose the original feel they were going for.  Running Hell loses a lot of its intensity in the new mix, for example. But I don't think they sound like junk midis. Hell, I think some of them, like Moonsong, improve with the new mixes.

But, opinions. 

EDIT: Just as a note, I'm talking about the Remastered music, the music the Grumps are using. The 'New' music, which is the other option in Cave Story + besides the originals, I'll 100% agree with you with.

b) The anointed people I knew seemed utterly boring. The *least* likely to be ruling as a prince in heaven with Jesus *ever*.

c) Not immediately, I don't think. I never saw that situation. I would assume that the kid would be blown off until they reached adulthood. If they stuck to their story the entire time, then maybe the Elders would give it a listen.

The Society would like everyone to believe the majority of folks claiming to be anointed now are somehow mentally ill or troubled. And indeed that *might* be true. But also remember, in the grand scheme of things, JW's are just about the only sect of Christianity that believes only 144,000 people are going to heaven. Even the bible seems to contradict this. There are likely to be a LOT of conscientious objectors as it were amongst the JW's: People who believe the biblical and traditional Christian belief that all good people go to heaven upon death, and that they should therefore partake of the memorial emblems.

In order to partake, they have to wear the mask of being anointed - whether they believe they are or not. 

And ultimately, a LOT of people feel they are secretly special. That they have a purpose and that some day they will fulfill that purpose. If you're a JW and experience this quite common belief, it doesn't take *mental illness* for you to arrive at the conclusion that you might be anointed."

AwesomeLandia,teaching,1388871491.0,"Read up about classroom management and develop procedures and rules for your classroom.  Make posters/signs for these and plan lessons to explicitly teach them to your class.  Keep the rules to 5 or fewer (too many rules becomes overload).  You can have as many procedures as you want, but definitely make them for the heavy hitters (ex: Using the restroom, turning in work, sharpening pencil, etc.).  Having a strong classroom management from the get go will save your life!  

Also, I recommend that you DO NOT advise any clubs, sports or take on any extra work unless required by your position.  Don't join leadership councils either.  There will be plenty of time to do these things after your first year, and these extra jobs actually bring a lot of extra work on.  You might think, ""Hey, only two hours a week and I earn an extra $50, sweet!"" In reality, it's two hours of instruction/supervision PLUS at least three more hours of prep work/clean up (depending on what you do).  "

dreamingofjellyfish,TwoXChromosomes,1388871556.0,"&gt;Is birth control a factor to why I'm always unhappy? 

Could be. But if this is a recent change consider other factors. And regardless, talk with your doctor and possibly a mental health profressional.

&gt;Do the negatives of the pill outweigh the benefits?

This is totally individual. It depends on both the person and the type of BC used. It is possible you would do better with a different pill, or hormonal BC may just not be worth it for you.

&gt;facts: I've been on the pill for four years. I have sex very often.

This is why you should look at other things that have changed &amp; talk with medical professionals. If your emotional health has changed, but the BC has stayed the same, then changing BC may improve things but it's less likely to be the sole cause.

If you want to drop the pill look for an alternative - condoms, IUD, nuvaring, diaphram, etc.

If the problems are intractable the reaction to the ultimatum will give the HL clarity and help them define their boundaries.  One thing you hear over and over here is that the HL doesn't want pity sex or forced sex, they want some effort and initiative from the LL.  The LL may need to realize that the HL is close to leaving to light a fire under their ass.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1388871722.0,"&gt;Thanks for the detailed response. You are 100% correct that I was wrong to suggest men are entirely unaffected. Men are indeed affected by the number of sexual partners although not to the extent that women are as the first study points out.

I think we agree more than disagree. I don't think either of us believes that having lots of partners is a-okay and won't leave you with baggage, not really. I've always thought it's a bad idea and people are, *in general*, better off if they're more selective and have relationships instead of one nighters. My objection wasn't so much with the idea that promiscuity is unhealthy; it was simply the double standard and its various logical gaps. I don't think that having a lot of sex defiles people or makes them bad or immoral or no longer dateable...but it does seem to be true that having partner after partner after partner, particularly if it's all FWBs and casual stuff, leaves people a little jaded. And again, it was mainly the idea that this only happens to ladies and never to men. 

&gt;The third study is actually one of the most interesting and one I'd come across before, although I understand your scepticism. The guy that did it, Jay Teachman, focuses on the lives of military men but this study was about their spouses.

It's not that I doubt his findings...it's just that, because men were not studied in the same light, it's hard to determine whether his results would be found in only women, or more often in women, or whether you'd find similar or the same results in men. It'd be neat to see a corresponding study performed on the same demographics of men.

&gt;Some very interesting findings that stemmed some pretty immediate counter-research by feminists looking to debunk the findings (and partially doing so by identifying religiosity as a factor IIRC).

I am always super suspicious of feminist-funded studies! It's one thing to perform a study because you have a hypothesis you are trying to either prove or disprove...it's totally another to perform a study because you are motivated by an ideology and another study pissed you off because of your beliefs. 

I'm going to read the links  you sent me a bit later...got a busy evening full of turkey coming up and I want to take my time with it. Anyway, this has been a really enjoyable discussion - and yeah, if you find more stuff, bring it! I'd be interested in seeing it. "

- A grand strategy game ala Crusader Kings 2 only that all famous historical female leaders are thrown into the same epoche (aka kinda like Civ 5 only that the leaders actually have personality and can interact with each other more directly)

- A DMC style game with party members where you get different combo combinations through who you take into battle (kinda like in Prince of Persia when the Prince throws Elika around with a dash of the assists  you have in fighting games) =&gt; co-op potential. The story would be rather than you being a main character who meets various new people all companions would have a tightly knit pre-existing relationship (all centered around a big secret/fallout about something mean that happened in the past, so many of the characters are antagonistic to each other in the beginning) and you have to talk to or interact with the companions to find out more or have the characters find closure with each other. Finding out more also unlocks different combos and taking people into battle more and utilizing their combos a lot in turn strengthens the relationship (basically if you are battle buddies that means the trust or appreciation grows between characters who were previously antagonistic).

But any couple with halfway decent communication doesn't need a book to tell them that, and it doesn't come near solving the kind of basic libido mismatch that the OP described, hence my frustration.

Jess_than_three,pics,1388872532.0,"Yup, I feel you. As a former server, for a while I felt the same way.. But at some point it's like, screw it, water *is* what I want, sorry. :/

The primary things servers were tracked on (weekly) at our store were:

* Table turn times, measured from the time a guest's order was rung in until the time their ticket was cashed out. Longer times ""indicated"" slow service - but sometimes people would just squat forever and not want to pay until they left, which you really can't do anything about. We would also sometimes cheat, writing tickets down for the kitchen and only punching them in right before the guest was ready to leave, sometimes having a turn time as low as a minute or two; while ultimately this really defeated the purpose, it was condoned by management.. 

* Bev%, which is just (number of beverages sold this shift)/(number of guests this shift) 

* Average total dollar amount of each guest's check (so, per person, not per table) 

* Dessert ratio (customers this shift divided by desserts sold this shift) 

I don't know if tracking all of this is common, but I do know that the POS software (MICROS) (edit: in case for whatever reason anyone is curious about the common features you can look for in a receipt to identify a MICROS system, [here you go](http://i.imgur.com/TYXrmJx.png) :)) that we used printed all of these things out in reports, and that that software is *incredibly* common. So potentially, one way you can help a server's numbers out, even if you're not ordering a drink or dessert, is to pay promptly. Personally, I like to have my payment ready when the check is dropped off, so the server doesn't have to make an extra trip back. 

Another thing you can do is to stack your plates and cups (utensils all on top, or in a cup!). This helps a *ton* with bussing tables, especially when there's not a dedicated busser and servers are cleaning their own tables (sans bus tub). "

keypuncher,Republican,1388872556.0,"It is worse even than that.

The Federal Government takes the money sent to it for Social Security taxes, and uses it to purchase ""non-marketable securities"" from itself.

It then spends the money so acquired as part of the general fund.

The non-marketable securities ""earn"" interest - which is paid for via income taxes and borrowing.

Social Security stopped bringing in more revenue via payroll taxes than it was paying out in benefits in 2010, and that is not ever expected to change.  The difference is currently being paid out of the ""interest"" on the non-marketable securities - i.e., via income taxes and borrowing.

When the ""interest"" is no longer enough to cover the difference, the government will have to sell the non-marketable securities back to itself to fund benefits... but the government has no money to redeem these securities - so the only way to get it is from income taxes and borrowing.

Of course, all that money the government is borrowing to pay the interest on the non-marketable securities, and the money it will eventually have to borrow to redeem them, adds to the debt - which we have to pay interest on.

So - the government took money from us, which it promised to invest and hold in trust for our old age, and then...

- spent the money
- will tax us now to pay us the interest on our money it ""invested""
- will tax us later to pay back some of our money it spent
- will tax us even later to pay the interest on the money it borrowed to pay back the rest of our money it spent

We're not just paying into Social Security.  We're paying into it twice, plus interest."

&gt;  I do it because maybe, just maybe, one of you talking heads will take a breath and actually do a little research.

I'm very interested in the Palestinian situation. It is partially a personal thing considering some of the war criminals who stole from and murdered parts of my family in Poland and Germany ran away to Israel under the law of return, and Israel refused to extradite them to face charges ""because anti Semitism"".

But even without that the history of the situation and Israeli treatment of Palestinians and Lebanese is pretty heinous, not the least because certain governments give them carte blanche to do whatever they want to.

&gt;  View the conflict from multiple perspectives.

Ironic, coming from you, I have to say.

&gt; But maybe there's a 5% who genuinely wants to try to understand the situation. Maybe at least one person will think about what I'm saying.

And up to this post of yours you haven't written anything worth discussing or dissecting or taking seriously.


&gt; I never said Israel was blame-free. It takes two to tango, after all.

You basically imply it. You also try to say that the Palestinians, who've been pissed on by the Israelis for over half a century, are somehow just as much to blame.

&gt; I know that a lot of people on here gladly ignore Jews who fight for equality in Israel and also all over the world

Considering that the people who bring this sort of thing up say ""See! We're so kind and worldly and compassionate, unlike those evil Arabs!"", I will ignore Israel sending supplies or a medical team somewhere. Plenty of nations do it.

&gt; the teams of Jews who travel illegally into conflict zones in order to stop genocide and assist in aid programs.


Getting sort of hilarious. There's no supreme team of Super-Jews flying around the world trying to stop genocide. Israel doesn't give a shit about genocide, apart from whenever they milk the holocaust or lyingly try and claim that the Palestinians are trying to start a second holocaust or stupid shit like that.

&gt;  Teams that are largely ignored by the world media and which you've probably never heard of.

Now you're just making things up. 

What's ignored by most media outlets in North America or Western Europe are instances of nations like Iran sending supplies or medical aid to disaster areas. A whole lot of nations do things like this and don't get reported on at all.

&gt;  Because Israel and the Jews are targeted for criticism a lot more than anyone else.

That's just blatantly untrue. To be honest, the Jewish/pro-Israel organizations in North America and Western Europe especially are under-criticized to a large degree."

Broken capillaries are permanent and you'll need laser surgery to fix them, so you really don't want to mess around with pore strips.  

If you're trying to minimize those clogs (they are sebaceous filaments, not blackheads), check out /r/skincareaddiction.  Personally I have had good results with a mineral oil massage (they call it OCM), 2% salicylic acid, and a clay mask (I also do moisturizer and sunscreen but those aren't relevant to the sebaceous filaments, just good practice for healthy skin).  It gets rid of them way better than pore strips ever did and it won't do any long-term damage to the skin!"
LolaRuns,Games,1388873025.0,"**DMC**: Got this for cheap during the steam sale and just finished it. The story is pretty middle of the road for a gaming story (I feel the main plothole is that the main character takes everything in quite a stride when the game takes place over what, like a day?) but man, is the dialog just baaaaad in its wanna be-ness. That said, the levels are gorgeous and interesting looking and the sound track was pretty great, I would lie if I claimed I didn't sometimes pump my fist in the air after beating a challenging section. 

I also probably have highly embarassing play times on this game because I got stuck on the endboss because I didn't get what the game wanted me to do/I thought the game was smarter than it actually was. [After the endboss gets below a health threshold he summons a magical double that protects him while he regenerates health. After he's on 1/3 health again the double wakes up again and attacks you, while the double disappears. Get him below the threshold again he again goes into hibernation again, summons the double, rince and repeat. Considering that several parts of the game put emphasis on taking out enemies within a tight time limit (both in the challenge rooms and in the game itself) I assumed the challenge of the boss fight was to kill the double before the main guy has finished regenerating. ](/spoiler)

[.... Actually no, instead all you do is that you activate special demon mode as soon as the boss goes into hibernation after which you can go over and attack him/one hit kill him without the double protecting him like it would normally do. ](/spoiler)

[I felt really, really, really stupid after finding that out. And it sucks because it makes the main boss a total pushover on the normal difficulties I believe (I easily got to the hibernation/double stage first time I played the mission, if I had known that all the game wanted was for me to activate devil mode to get a one hit kill...)](/spoiler)

Still, other than this head desk moment (and some other in regards to the dialog) it was still a pretty fun game. (I played it on the PC with a 360 controller, aka Best of Both Worlds)

I'm midly curious about the Vergil's Downfall DLC and kinda miffed that it didn't go on sale together with the main game. 

**Hearthstone:** Not much to say. Slowly working my way up the ranks and grinding quests. Feeling the pain of refusing to buy any decks with real money because I feel lots of the cool meta decks that get promoted I can't do because I lack the special cards. Still, wouldn't be playing it if I didn't enjoy it and it's interesting how doing something as simple as just attaching a tiny cute icon to the rank manage to completely invigorate my interest in playing ranked over playing Arena. 

**Skulls of the Shogun:** Finished this as my last game of the old year. Still cute, still an interesting battle system even if too many of the final boss battles could be beat by ""camping"". Then I started doing the bonus island and the spike in difficulty (because here you take your surviving troops with you to the next stage) was rather striking. 

I also finally installed **Civ 5** but it seems to be crashing a ton on my Windows 8 machine. I also play small runs of **Race the Sun** between games/to unwind even though I'm strikingly terrible at it. I kinda wish it had the option to remove/kick out challenges at least occasionally (like once per week/month would be enough), along the lines of the quests in Hearthstone where you can kick out quests that you don't enjoy.

Renner1,OneY,1388873436.0,"&gt; Even after decades of reasonable actions, feminists are still branded as man-hating bra-burners which is not true, except of a very tiny sliver of feminists. 


I see myself as egalitarian-- within reason, naturally-- but I've always found myself to be contemptuous of the second and third wave rhetoric and theory.

Partially because of blatant historical revisionism-- everyone before the 1960's ""hated women"" or otherwise went out of their way to consciously oppress them-- and these theories that keep bouncing around and have essentially zero credibility.

This is essentially the character of the so-called ""gender feminists"" who make up the vast majority of the feminists in the academic world, and they seemingly get more loopy by the day. I can say that I am very happy that there is a majority of women who don't identify as gender feminists or who see themselves as egalitarians in practise and don't constantly go on and on about gender relations.

But the turning the relations between the sexes into an outright war, the historical revisionism, the rabid reaction to the idea of men having power and their talking about how men want to oppress women at every chance they get, not to mention the worst in terms of theory that've recently come to the fore-- ""rape culture"", ""slut shaming"", ""pseudo rapist"", ""men have to be taught not to rape""-- all of these things make me want to have absolutely nothing to do with those third wave feminists (and the remnants of the second wave) who seem to be all about vilifying and lying about men in general.

qqwasd,GameDeals,1388873458.0,"&gt; I doubt it's the developers, but that's neither here nor there.

It is entirely relevant. Why do you doubt its the developers? Money from the sales of the game goes directly to supporting the developers unless I am mistaken. Granted the publisher takes a significant cut however I am providing the same benefit to the developer as an American citizen would if he/she bought the game. 

&gt;If it had the same impact, the pricing would be set equally around the world.

You show your clear lack of understanding of the issue here. This is false, the increased price in Australia occurs due to big companies, in this case publishers, realizing that due to Australia's higher standard and cost of living people will be more willing to pay more for games. Its got nothing to do with providing equal benefits or whatever you're claiming. 

Correct me if I am wrong here, but it is my understanding that the prices during the steam sale are the same for American and Canadian customers, and I gather this extends to most products within your country. I appreciate that some services such as Netflix are more expensive, whereas they are completely unavailable in Australia. Regardless of Canada's situation, most of Europe is given comparable prices, before tax, for games and other digital and non digital international goods. Australia on the other hand is constantly exploited for its willingness to pay more for the same product. Let's take Sims 4 for example. At EB Games, which is the Australian branch of Gamestop, Sims 4 costs $90 (this includes a tax of 20%, making the cost before tax around $83, whereas in the US, at Bestbuy, it is only $60 (this is exclusive of tax due to the US system). In the UK at Gamestop, it costs the equivalent of $73 (while this is admittedly a price hike from the US, however this includes a VAT of 20%, making the actual price almost exactly $60).

I do not feel entitled in my actions, I feel justified. There is a distinction. I feel entitled to receive games at the appropriate price, and therefore appropriate in my actions to circumvent measures that prevent me from doing so. 

Despite citing the definition of hacking, you seem to have a terrible understanding of its meaning. In case you forgot:

&gt;gain unauthorized access to data in a system or computer

I am not gaining access to any data in any system or computer. This clearly does not fall under the definition of hacking as I am not accessing any protected information. The use of a VPN in itself is not illegal, the only action I am taking that is illegal is the breaking of the ToS. I would also like to make the distinction that it is not the developers instituting these policies, it is the publishers. 

&gt;I'm just waiting for the big sob story on one of the big gaming subs

I fully accept the risk of what I am doing, and understand that I am violating many ToS. Whether I am violating Steam's ToS is another matter, as I have refrained from using VPN's on Steam, although granted I have redeemed games from other retailers (using this method) on Steam. 

The inherent unfairness and money grubbing nature of this policy has been recognized by a government inquiry into IT pricing which made the following recommendation: 

&gt;The Committee recommends that the Australian Government amend the Copyright Act’s section 10(1) anti-circumvention provisions to clarify and secure consumers’ rights to circumvent technological protection measures that control geographic market segmentation.

I guess the way I worded it in the post made it sound like it should be your late game boot choice... I just meant to say that Arcane Boots is actually better for Storm than Power Treads in term of added ulti distance, contrary to popular belief.

Pretty much everyone seemed to think that the only reason you'd ever build Arcane's on Storm is if you're rushing Bloodstone as the expanded manapool but no extra mana regen feels like it would do more harm than good, but it turns out that it's still better than Power Treads.

Of course, don't take this too literally like everyone seems to be doing with this post, this does not factor in Tread switching, the extra attack speed and survivability that Treads give you.

As I stated before, BKB was not included because this analysis is meant to purely only look at Ball Lightning efficiency, and ignores any utility of the items. I trust that players will be smart enough to adapt this item build to their needs and will recognize when they need a BKB and when they can skip it."

A 2005 report from a federal voting rights commission chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker said in a footnote that about 12 percent of the United States voting-age population did not have driver’s licenses. The figure came from U.S. Department of Transportation and Census Bureau data.

&gt;We also found a May 24, 2011, report from Norman Robbins, research director for Northeast Ohio Voter Advocates, that examined driver’s license data specifically in Ohio. The report concluded that 940,000 Ohioans over age 18 lacked driver’s licenses. That’s nearly an 11 percent rate, higher than figures cited by proponents of Ohio voter ID laws. Robbins said in his findings that previous figures were erroneous because they failed to take into account such factors as deceased license holders and Ohioans who had moved out of state but were still in the state license database.

Breast cancer is one of the few cancers that you can do a rudimentary self-screening for.  

Of course, recent research has shown that self-exams don't actually help people catch cancer sooner, but you'll have a hard time stopping the propaganda machine once it's rolling.

Renner1,worldpolitics,1388874073.0,"&gt; Why did Israel agree to this then, in 1978?

The Accords recognized the ""legitimate rights of the Palestinian people"", a process was to be implemented guaranteeing the full autonomy of the people within a period of five years. Begin insisted on the adjective ""full"" to confirm that it was the maximum political right attainable. This full autonomy was to be discussed with the participation of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians. The withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and Gaza was agreed to occur after an election of a self-governing authority to replace Israel's military government


How is this relevant in any way at all? I get that part of your schtick is ""reasonable Israelis, evil Arabs"", but obviously this didn't work out because Israel didn't want it to.

&gt; In a poll from 2001, 81% of Isralies were in favor of that agreement still, and were opposed to further taking of land. I know you must think Israelis are horrible creatures and monsters, but most of them support a two state solution as long as Hamas quits using terrorist tactics against them.

Actually, you're the one who seems to have weird ideas about the Palestinians. 2001 was during the Second Intifada, which was accelerated by the Israelis shooting at protestors with millions of live rounds and from helicopter gunships, remember?

 &gt; Why have Jews been attacked by middle easterners in Europe if middle eastern muslims aren't simply anti-Semitic?

This sounds pretty dumb, even for you. I guess the context you're talking about are extremists or Salafi Jihadi attacking Jews in Europe-- not at all an accurate indicator of the ""Arabs""-- who you see as evil and homogenous-- but good shit to try and spread around to dunces, I suppose.

Your post doesn't make any sense in response to mine, by the way-- a ""what about the camp david accords because it doesn't matter that Israel was still collectively abusing and killing Palestinians"" and some claim that the Israelis wanted peace when the IDF was shooting unarmed protestors."

Many women were perplexed by the notation and the moderators had to put up a sticky verbally walking people through the routines. 

I think the author, Lou Schuler, has said somewhere in the abyss of the internet that men are used to the notation from years of Muscle and Fitness and other male-geared magazines.

What's worse is that in that specific case, even the underlying thinking is kind of flawed. If what they're trying to see is how quickly a table turns over - ie, is ready to be used again for another guest - that's *super* valuable on a Friday night or a weekend lunch time or any other busy period (kids' night maybe?), because if you're on a wait list to begin with, you really do want people to leave quickly so that other guests can use the table. Better throughout is important there. But if it's eight o'clock on a Monday night and three-quarters of the tables are open, why *wouldn't* you want someone hanging out, drinking coffee with their friends or doing homework or whatever? Sure, they're there for two hours, but that doesn't tell you that the service was slow and it doesn't mean that throughout suffered - it means that the guest felt comfortable and at home, and in a business that relies heavily on regulars, isn't that what you *want?*"

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388874341.0,"&gt;I'm fairly sure that, adjusted for income, US living expenses aren't as bad as many think

No, but even if you add 10% to the cost, that kind of thing adds up, that's an extra couple of thousand dollars per student.  

There are a huge collection of factors that go into the 'cost' of something  like universities.  What legal structure do their pension funds operate under, do they get special tax beaks (and if so how much), do they run their own security (the university I am at with &gt; 30k students has 4 or 5 cars and  a dozen or so on campus police).  A lot of that is shuffling money around between various branches of government and the bulk of the money a university spends ends up going towards keeping buildings running and staff paid.  Some universities in Europe (I'm looking at you Cambridge!) don't have parking of any note, whereas a lot of places here wouldn't have any students if there wasn't parking, and different fee structures may include parking or not.  

E.g. where I am universities aren't allowed to skim off a portion of research grant funds the way they are in the US.  But since most of our money comes from governments, and most research grants are federal grants, all you'd end up doing is shuffling around, whether you call it a grant or a direct transfer payment money still needs to be paid.

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1388874457.0,"This is really common. Like, mind-blowingly common.  

It could be that he has a cuckholding fetish, which involves an element of humiliation (for him).  But there are a ton of guys who get turned on by this prospect who don't get off on the humiliation, but just get turned on by the idea of their partner being with someone else, whether they participate or not.  

It's also pretty normal for a guy to be ashamed of these feelings.  Society encourages men to view women as property to be protected and dominated to some degree (and not in the fun kinky way) and kept away from all other men.  So for some guys, finding this hot makes them question their masculinity.  For the cuckholders, it's that very dynamic that gets them off!  But a lot of this seems to be rooted in biology.

I'm too lazy to look up links, but there's been some scientific documentation of ""sperm competition"" between males in various species, including humans, combined with the anecdotal evidence that lots of guys find this hot - it might be an evolutionary thing.  Knowing that a guy has had sex with your partner can create arousal so you can then have sex with her with the idea that your (sorry, generic ""your"" for guys here) sperm is competing with the other dude. 

M/F couples in poly and open relationships probably are familiar with the M part of the couple being pretty interested in the F half after she's met with a boyfriend - this may explain why.

Even if you don't put much stock in evolutionary biology - and I'm fairly agnostic about it - from a psychological perspective knowing your partner is desired by other people can be very erotic for a variety of reasons.  In longer term relationships we may become accustomed to our partner's charms and attractiveness, but seeing them through someone else's eyes - or dick, as it were - reminds you how hot they are.  There's also some social status stuff that can be triggered by that - trophy/prize stuff.

Tl;dr: There's a ton of reasons this could turn your bf on, it's incredibly normal, and he should be reassured.  In the meantime, have fun."

That aspect isn't a part of candaulism, and candaulism also involves more than watching her having sex, for instance seeing other men flirt with her, taking pictures of her that she shows off to other men, or more generally showing her off to other men and taking pleasure in the fact they find her hot and want to have sex with her (and sometimes to).

It has been speculated that the reasons male commonly are aroused by watching females they're paired with having sex with others, and the reason why females take longer to come than men do generally, is to encourage more males having sex with the same female to encourage genetic diversity.

So for the record, he's not weird at all. Many, many guys are also turned on by it, whether in fantasy only or enough to want to actually do it.

EDIT: it seems, according to the wikipedia article (if it can be trusted) that in english candaulism also involves doing this without the woman's consent.

jalkloben,leagueoflegends,1388875229.0,"How do you suppose I am gonna throw my ability's when her shield isn't up, when it is up 2,5 out of 3,6 seconds with max CDR, which most Rivens build, Thats a 1.1 SECOND window to throw all my damage on her, and if she plays it well, I'm stunned/knocked up during that time. 

I don't cry about Riven being op, I play against her frequently and would say I win half my lanes against her, but her utility and durability while having so high burst and sustained damage just does not work when she has that insane amount of mobility that comes with her kit.

Shes arguably the heaviest hitting champion in league of legends with a 4.9 AD ratio over hear skill set. No other champion has this high ratios, very few mages even have this good ratios with AP, and they miss out on the ability to have strong auto attacks. This is not counting her passive, which would if used perfectly bring the AD ratios up to 8.9 which is an insane amount. 

Now you are probably gonna come with the argument 

""Well shes still really squishy, you just have to CC lock her""

Well, It's not that easy is it? With Riven having 4 dashes it is REALLY hard to land skill shots on her, especially as CC skill shots in general are slow moving (Not always, but it's quite common), you essentially need to have a targeted lock-down (Read: Vi ult, Taric E, Ryze W) if shes good at dodging.

And now I'm asking you, why is a champion designed to get a proportionally to the cool down of the ability HUGE shield (Can as you should know be well over 500 with full build) also get 4 dashes while dishing out the most damage in the game?

Why am I implying she dashes out the highest damage in the game?

Theres a reason behind it and not just me wanting Riven nerfed, she has the highest scaling AD ratios in the game, a HUGE steroid in her ult as well as passive. And if you do the quick combo perfectly you essentially have no reason to build attack speed. At all. 

Now these are only what I consider the most important parts that is ""wrong"" about how her kit works, if you make any valid counter argument I'm interested in discussing more about it."

llamasrus,worldnews,1388875577.0,"As I mentioned before, I personally don't find the word cunt as offensive. It's a powerful word and I like the way it sounds. If English was my native language, I'd probably use it in daily conversation - instead I use vittu, which has the same literal translation as cunt, but is used the way fuck is in English.

Still, it's a word for female genitalia. I don't think many people using it actively think ""I'm gonna use this word out of all possible swear words because it's a nasty word for a female body part"" but it still is a choice. When you think of words describing body parts, words used for male parts have mostly positive connotations (for example 'to have balls'). Female parts on the other hand often have negative connotations (pussy, cunt). When there are gender-neutral options available, choosing a word such as cunt (consciously or not) might seem somewhat misogynistic to some people, even if it's not meant that way. Especially if only used to describe men, since... Hmm. Kind of like if you use the word gay as an insult. There's nothing wrong with actual cunts (as we agree, vaginas are awesome), but when you only use the word to describe male assholes, that kind of sounds like there's something bad about actual cunts, too. Sorry for the clumsy explanation, hope you can understand my point.

From what I can see, I think we're more or less on the same page on this. I can't speak on behalf of every woman out there, but you're ok in my book, if that means anything. Heh, I probably offend people myself without intending to, hopefully learning as I go along.

I'll just end my rambling by mentioning that other thing that really interests/bugs me. Yes, I agree, bad things said online shouldn't be taken personally, as they are directed at nobody in particular. Yet that anonymous, faceless being is by default male, hetero &amp; white. Most importantly male. That anonymous man is generally insulted by implying there's something wrong with his sexuality (fag etc.) or his manliness in general, often by using feminine words. This is what can make the insults feel personal from a female perspective. And if it becomes known that the anonymous man is in actuality female, the slurs often become even more gender-focused. As if differing from the male norm is by itself an offense, a flaw.

Do men ever think of this or is it just natural to always use the male perspective? This is a huge issue that often crosses my mind. But it's getting late and I'm typing this on mobile, so I think I'll end it here and see what you think :)"

ActuallyAnAlpaca,Conservative,1388876057.0,"the 24th Amendment abolishes poll taxes. This was extended to state elections (Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections) because of the Equal Protection Clause, which states  
&gt;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  

  
        
&gt;The Court noted that “a state violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard. Voter qualifications have no relation to wealth.”


The requirements for background checks pass strict scrutiny (which is required to abridge fundamental rights) in the interests of public safety.  
&gt; Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in 2008 wrote that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable prohibitions and regulations and subsequently federal court rulings have upheld existing gun prohibitions and regulations.  

&gt; Nadine Strossen, former president of the American Civil Liberties Union, has stated that the individual rights model must yield to reasonable regulation. ""Let's assume for the sake of argument it does protect an individual right,"" said Strossen, ""it is no more absolute than freedom of speech or any other right in the Constitution. No right is absolute; the government is always allowed to restrict the right if it can satisfy Constitutional strict scrutiny and show the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote a goal of compelling importance.""  


&gt;In its 1997 decision in the case, the Supreme Court ruled that the provision of the Brady Act that compelled state and local law enforcement officials to perform the background checks was unconstitutional on 10th amendment grounds. The Court determined that this provision violated both the concept of federalism and that of the unitary executive. However, the overall Brady statute was upheld and state and local law enforcement officials remained free to conduct background checks if they so chose.
  


Requiring a background check does not create undue hardship upon prospective gun owners at the moment. If one was required to take a check that cost a significant amount of money (probably multiple times the purchase price) then one could say it was infringing."

As far as I can tell, the sword-pistols are only used as part of the finishing moves in combo kills and stuff and don't actually use ammo.

IMO, the best collectible is the mayan stele, since the armour set you get as a reward makes you immune to bullets, which is pretty useful, given that the only time I got damaged in combat was when I got shot from a distance or my retarded crewmembers crowd me on a ship deck and I can't fight properly."

People in small towns talk. People associate you with the terrible things your family has done. People make judgments about you based on what they know about your connections. 

One approach is to ignore it, another approach is to combat it. I think it's just a value difference and as long as she isn't telling people the specific details of the abuse, there's no real wrongdoing. 

I say OP should tell her his values and how he'd like her to deal with it, and also, they may seriously want to consider moving from that town. 

There's no escaping his father, and this clearly makes his girlfriend feel unsafe, and like her/their reputation is not safe.

My entire line is that it is **highly interesting** that the article and link title stress Happer's Princeton connection, without once mentioning his highly relevant position as chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute.

You don't seem to think it is interesting. In fact, you seem to be incurious about it.

According to you, it was **absolutely fine** for vested interests to pay scientists to provide studies that disputed the connection between smoking and cancer. Accoording to you, the science should stand on its own merits. That is absolutely fine insofar as it goes - the problem is that **the science didn't stand on its merits, vested interests knew that, and disseminated it anyway**. And **that** strategy is page one of the rejectionist playbook - obfuscate, and sow doubt.

As it happens, Happer's position is also utter crap, from start to finish. As it was in 2012, when this article was posted. As it was when it was responded to at the time, dissected, taken to pieces. And **none** of that rebuttal is take n on board by those that desperately want to believe this tosh. 

And here it is again, all this time later, as if he's just some clever Princeton PhD who's speaking common sense, rather than the chairman of a wealthy right-wing organisation whose sole purpose is to fill the world with scientific disinformation.

That's actually not how feminists define Patriarchy. It's not ""all men at the cost of all women,"" it's men in general are privileged and women in general are oppressed, but they do allow that an individual man might be less privileged than an individual woman. However, this funding disparity still conflicts with their worldview; if our patriarchal system was designed to oppress women and give men privilege, then men would be getting more funding. Then again, there are already hundreds of things proving the feminist theory wrong, so I doubt this is going to stop them from whining about male privilege. If anything, they'll just do what they always do, and blame this on the Patriarchy ""backfiring,"" because men were trying to oppress women here but accidentally oppressed ourselves instead.

Because he kept telling me I wasn't thin enough, that made ME feel self conscious about how small he was. 
All in all, I'd probably have dated shorter men even after the fact because I really do think that while physical attraction is important, there are many more things that could make you miserable in a relationship, if your first criteria was height.

She isn't losing herself to her boyfriend, she is finding herself in her boyfriend and she doesn't actually exist in any other way. 

Chances are that your friendship was also based in this kind of identity building. 

I used to do this intensely for about the first 10 years of adolescence and early adulthood. 5+ years of therapy, 12-step group meetings, meditation practice and a religious shift later and I'm much much better. 

But every day I have to confront co-dependent habits and insecurities related to the way I perceive people's reactions to me.

Our sexual intimacy is a vital part of our relationship. It's fun, it's a way of showing love and it's a confidence boost. If he wanted to take that away... I'd be devastated. Sex with him is such an emotional thing for me. It would be like saying, ""I don't want to talk to you anymore"" or ""I don't want to hold your hand"".

No one should maintain a relationship with someone ""unconditionally"". We all have conditions. Like fidelity, living in a certain place, having/not having kids, no abuse etc. Conditions are good and they are healthy. Love is not a good enough reason to stay in a relationship. 

I think your main issue is with how you view sex. I was raised religious and it took a lot of growing and learning before I reached a place where sex stopped making me feel guilty. I'd advise doing some soul searching and really working out how you feel about sex. Is it something you only do with someone you love? Is it something you wait until marriage for? Do you feel emotionally connected during sex? What do you want from sex? How does sex make you feel? ... some questions to ask yourself."

It doesn't change that Beta brings in some of the greatest acts in the world almost weekly. For example, in basically one month recently, I saw Paul Oakenfold, Aly and Fila, Ferry Corsten, and Markus Schulz in back to back to back to back weeks, which is an incredible lineup of talented trance artists, which is not the kind of music (unlike Dubstep, trap, and electro house) that attracts mostly the crowds you seem to dislike.

In addition, if we include government spending as part of the ""riches""... well, in regards to healthcare research, women are more than 4x as rich as men.

I then, being a considerate person, would've brought the child and my SO some other treat so that I wasn't the only one with treats. 

Also, fun fact about kids: they destroy all your nice, meaningful stuff. You have no business being in a home with children if you are going to get upset about something as simple as a donut being demolished. Someday your 2K graphics tablet will be destroyed by milk, or your expensive earrings will be bent or lost, or there'll be shit embedded in your cashmere sweater. 

Later on, your cars will be crashed and job put at risk due to some crazy crises, or you'll be paying for a neighbors window. 

There are about ten trillion things more significant than what happened today. You have a right to feel bad, but it's not your girlfriend's fault, and it's especially not the child's fault. It's your choice. 

Also, you seem to equate things being smashed into the floor with things not being appreciated. Wrong. That kid probably loved the heck out of that donut It was probably the highlight of his morning. He's 18 months. That's how an 18 month year old shows how much they enjoy something. They destroy it with their uncoordinated attempts to devour it.

zon1,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1388879998.0,"I have four favorites from this year! 

1. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty: Wow. I have seen it twice so far, once when I got advanced screening tickets to see it early December, and the second time on Christmas day. I noticed new things to appreciate the second time and I anticipate watching it many more times. I absolutely loved the cinematography, the music, everything that is visual and audial about it. The elements combined to create a beautiful image and powerful story that engages you to the very end. Walter Mitty is a story that will have you on the edge of your seat for a long time, excited to see what happens, though it is not without its funny moments. There are plenty of things to laugh at, and the audience went through a whirlwind of all different emotions watching it. I definitely cried.

2. Catching Fire: I am admittedly a very big fan of the Hunger Game series, and loved the first one just as much as this. It's plain to see that the budget was much higher for this sequel, and it adds so much to the movie to have those little things that otherwise would not have been possible. Catching Fire does justice to the book it is based upon, and it is a big treat to watch. 

3. Monsters University: Super, duper cute. I love Monsters Inc., and this was the perfect sequel to it. I loved watching the monsters we know and love along with new, equally as interesting, supporting characters. The story is so cute and it is the kind of movie you want to watch to cheer you up whenever possible. 

4. Gravity: I know that Gravity has its criticisms, and rightfully so, but it is the kind of movie that you have to watch. It's done so well, and there was obviously a lot of effort put into making it as real as possible. The symbolism and the visuals are so well done and it is definitely worth seeing on a big screen...if you get the chance. "

ActuallyAnAlpaca,Conservative,1388880768.0,"&gt; Watts claimed that his results show the planet warming at just 0.155 degrees Celsius per decade, rather than the 0.309 C per decade cited by the government.  

&gt; Andrew Revkin of the New York Times noted that the satellite data that Watts had previously stood behind indicated a warming over the U.S. closer to NOAA’s estimate.

&gt; Climate Audit blogger Steven McIntyre said he was puzzled about being listed as a co-author of the paper, qualifying his involvement as ""very last minute and limited"" and admits to not having ""parsed"" parts of the Watts study. Both McIntyre and Howard University chemistry professor Josh Halpern commented that Watts had not made TOBS [time of observation] bias corrections.


&gt; The same week that Watts released his analysis,[49] University of California, Berkeley physicist Richard Muller released an update to the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) study. Leo Hickmam of The Guardian writes that Watts was consulted on the methodology of the study and had stated, ""I'm prepared to accept whatever result they produce, even if it proves my premise wrong.""

&gt;""First, there were issues around station quality - Watts showed that some of the stations had poor quality. We studied that in great detail. Fortunately, we discovered that station quality does not affect the results. Even poor stations reflect temperature changes accurately."" 


&gt; Watts has since backed off his position, saying the study is of no value because its parts have not been peer reviewed, ""When the science and peer review is finished, the results are likely to look different."" Watts said that much of the BEST data should be thrown out, ""...there is no adjustment procedure in place to fix this, [...] BEST tries to solve it, and I applaud them for the attempt. But without knowing the history of the station, even their methodology doesn't deal with it"".

If you like lab-created stones, you have more options and more affordable versions of the previously mentioned stones.

&gt; Stavzor (valproic acid) Typical Side Effects  
The usual for antiepileptic drugs - strange dreams, wanting to sleep a lot, your memory will be a bit iffy and so forth. Plus a special set for valproates: instant old age. You’ll get fat, bald, tired, confused, dry &amp; itchy skin, uninterested in sex, unable to hold your liquor, lose your teeth, and whatever you don’t puke will give you heartburn and/or the runs. Fortunately these side effects are both dosage-dependent (the more valproic acid you take the more likely it is you’ll get them and/or the worse they’ll be) and most, like the nausea and other GI problems, are usually temporary. Unfortunately two side effects people complain about the most - weight gain and hair loss - tend to stick around, as does the occasional tremor and urge to yell at kids to get off of your lawn. At least you can take antacids like Maalox to deal with the GI problems. You cannot take Pepto-Bismal and valproic acid, as its active ingredient is related to aspirin, and aspirin and valproates is a big no-no. Sometimes a really big no-no. The same goes for Alka-Seltzer.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1388886547.0," * Receiving blankets and burp clothes are super easy.  Our local fabric store has a whole ""baby central"" section full of cotton flannelette in cute baby patterns.  We do receiving blankets between 36' and 42' square, and buy a little extra for burp clothes, usually an extra 12 inches or so on the bolt you buy for a receiving blanket will give you 2 decent sized burp clothes/spit up rags.  Just fold the edge over and straight stitch.  Do the same with some fleece for easy blankets, the kind that you're not afraid to use and wash and risk wrecking!

 * Homemade moby wrap, you need 5 - 6 meters of cotton blend jersey, the kind of stretchy stuff you use for active wear.  I had enough to make 3 wraps from the bolt I bought so I gave them as gifts.  5 meters was long enough for me (had some trouble getting a longer bolt at my fabric store!) and I'm mostly average size, but I have a friend who is quite big and it wasn't long enough for her to tie off comfortably.  No sewing required, you can sell the extra wraps on craigslist or Kijiji to recover some of the cost of the fabric too.

 * Nursery decorations: cross stitch kits, painted wood pieces, picture frames, curtains, you name it.  Just wander through Michael's or any other big craft store for ideas.  Consider making birth announcements yourself with scrapbooking supplies so all you have to do when baby arrives is add a picture!  Also home-made mobiles!

 * Quilting/knitting/crochet are outside the realm of my craftiness, but you can do that for baby blankets, hats, and other fun stuff.  We have a lot of grandmas that provide that stuff so I haven't really learned yet, my kids have more special blankets than they will ever need.

 * Baby food.  I know it's too early for that now but it is seriously SO EASY!  I can't believe anyone ever pays for it, it's just too easy not to do yourself.  I would make one type of fruit, veggie, or meat per week, freeze it in ice cube trays and then move into freezer bags, and you're just set for ages.  

edit: had to add, the more you make yourself the less restricted you are to what they sell in the boy and girl sections!  Colors exist outside of pink/blue/yellow/green!"

I think LfA did a good job of killing the idea of a maniac pixie dream girl, but John Green didn't think so, hence Paper Towns (psst spoiler alert). This book features the main character idolizing this broken character the whole book, going as far as getting his friends to drive a straight 24 hours to save her. And guess what?

Look at the plist file (using the properties viewer) and look at all the icon names it uses(Note how many there are if you have bad memory). Then go back to the folder with all the icons. Click the first Icon name that looks familiar with the image viewer. Then look to see if it's 120x120 (look at the top under the name of the image). Then click the right arrow button and keep going through to see if they are all 120x120.

pinkfu,TumblrInAction,1388887286.0,"I shall summarize for you and posterity. I would have done it sooner but I had a terrible migraine + cold and fever yesterday. :(

/u/ccmmssjl12 was involved in a rather lengthy dumb ass ""argument"" thread above when I commented that I had an RES tag for her that said ""chick that speaks with authority, doesn't actually know shit. also: DUI"". Given the context of the thread here, the whole ""speaks with authority"" part was the relevant bit and I am amused when RES tags show me another side to a conversation. Sometimes I like to share. 

Now, I suppose I originally made the tag to say ""chick that speaks with authority, doesn't actually know shit."" but later came across a comment of hers in which she said ""I have a DUI. So what?"" So I guess I amended the RES tag with ""also: DUI"" and changed the link in the tag to the DUI comment. I don't really remember doing it because it was a month ago and I smoke cannabis daily (a host of medical reasons, I don't get to feel human if I don't so I take the memory issues and being prone to rambling as a mild side effect of my medication). Most of the time I tag people and immediately forget about it until I see them again. The RES tagging system is just super helpful for not storing useless information in my brain. :)

As you can see above in the thread, [well, she deleted it so now you can't] she flipped out about the contextually unrelated DUI part of the tag. I provided a link to the comment with the first two sentences of the comment ""I have a DUI. So what?"". 

She immediately deleted that comment and THEN replied to me both in the thread and in PM. She then PMed me again, further raving, about her ""reputation"" being damaged by false DUI claims. Hence my comments about creepy PMs and her needing to stop that shit.

Funny enough, if I had misunderstood her comment about having a DUI it stands to reason that just leaving my link to the comment would be enough to vindicate her, right? If it was all just a way to commiserate or give an example or whatever the hell she claimed, it would have been easy to see by clicking the link I provided. 

I don't really care, but I'm not a fan of someone trying to trash me just to CYA. That's some bullshit. As you can see, she has since deleted all of her comments here. I fucking hate it when people delete comments. Comment deleters should die in a fire. 

In my 8 years of reddit this might be one of the weirdest threads I've been involved in.

[Scott Walker](http://governor.ontheissues.org/Scott_Walker.htm) - Liberals have done their best to demonize him, but he's doing well so far.

[Bobby Jindal](http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Bobby_Jindal.htm) - Don't know a lot about him, but he's anti-amnesty and anti-gun control - two points in his favor.

[Paul Ryan](http://www.ontheissues.org/Paul_Ryan.htm) - His support for amnesty for illegals is a poison pill for conservatives.  His recent budget deal didn't help any.  He talks a good game on the debt, but didn't follow through.

[Peter King](http://www.ontheissues.org/Peter_King.htm) - His support for the NSA makes him a no-go for me.

[Ben Carson](http://www.ontheissues.org/Ben_Carson.htm) - Has said he will not run in 2016.

[John Bolton](http://www.ontheissues.org/John_Bolton.htm) - Don't know a lot about him, what little impression I do have of him is not positive.

[Marco Rubio](http://www.ontheissues.org/Marco_Rubio.htm) - Support for amnesty and his saying one thing in English language interviews and the opposite in Spanish language interviews will doom him.

[Jeb Bush](http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm) - Nobody is interested in a Bush dynasty.  Two was enough."

RichAfterTaxes,gamecollecting,1388887991.0,"Thankfully, I don't think Wii stuff will increase quite as dramatically as GCN stuff did. GameCube had the perfect storm, since it was a relatively unsuccessful system followed by a highly successful (and backwards-compatible) one. A lot of Wii owners who skipped the Cube wanted to go back and see what they missed, it's moving into that ""nostalgia sweet spot"" for the OG Cube owners, and because the original GCN install base was so low, supply is nowhere near demand nowadays. It's a deadly combination if there ever was one. 

That having been said, I fully agree with you. I don't think the hits from Wii's first few years will spike too much in the near future - there's untold millions of Brawl's and Mario Kart Wii's out there - but I can't see them getting much lower, either. And it's an especially good time to stock up on the system's later releases; end-of-lifespan titles usually hold their value more to begin with, and since the Wii has had far fewer people paying attention to it in the second half of its life, I think the difference will be particularly strong. 

I expect Skyward Sword, Mario Party 9, Kirby Nightmare in Dreamland and a few others to be really difficult to find for cheap down the road. Shit, Kirby's *already* difficult to find for cheap. "

To OP: I have two Samsung EVOs - a 250GB for OSX and another 500GB (installing it today) for my Windows, programs and games. It is worth it. ~$180 for a 250GB EVO. That can hold most people's Windows and programs. Move all the extra documents, music, videos, torrents and porn to the HDD and you've got yourself a computer that boots in five seconds from pressing the power button, gets you into matches in a second and lets you open up your programs faster than you can say ""windows"".

Get one if you can. Get the biggest EVO you can afford. The price difference between the Samsung 830 SSDs and the 840s (EVOs and Pros) is almost none so go for the EVOs. Sure if you see a better deal on the Corsair, OCZ or Toshiba SSDs, go for it. Kingston I don't like because they, to me, are like the $2 shop version of component manufacturers.

Keep an eye out on /r/buildapcsales and use www.camelcamelcamel.com to watch the price changes on Amazon. Make sure to use www.pcpartpicker.com to find the best price on a product.

If you're in Australia, use www.staticice.com.au and www.pcpartpicker.com.au to compare prices. Also keep an eye out on Amazon and www.ozbargain.com.au

sp00nzhx,news,1388889274.0,"Are we talking about Hebrew (Ivrit) or Modern Hebrew/Israeli Hebrew (Ivrit Chadash/Ivrit Yisre'elit)? There is absolutely zero confusion about the former - it's most definitely a Semitic language, even though its use was primarily restricted to a liturgical role (for example, about 2000 years ago the primary spoken languages of the area now known as Israel were Latin and Aramaic, while Jewish services were delivered in Hebrew).

Then there's the latter. It sounds as if you're a follower of the ideas put forth by one Shlomo Izre'el. In 2003, he published his *Corpus Linguistics and Modern Hebrew: Towards the Compilation of The Corpus of Spoken Israeli Hebrew (CoSIH)* which posited that Modern Hebrew is actually a creole language constructed for the national identity of Israel. It's a weird and almost unilaterally ignored theory. Most linguists agree that Modern Hebrew is a (modernization of and a) ""continuation of Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew.""

I think it's time to put your point down, man.

EDIT: I'll give you a fraction of a point. It's possible that there was influence from other languages such as Yiddish in the formative years of the Zionist movement (really the start of Hebrew as a spoken, day-to-day language), but that's because people were migrating to Israel and learning the updated Hebrew as a second language. Then, of course, there are the loanwords and whatnot. Your position is still far on the sidelines so to put it forth as an agreed upon fact is beyond ludicrous.

EDIT 2: Put quotation marks around a phrase that I borrowed."

temp9876,BabyBumps,1388889968.0,"From my experience doctors are very cautious about ruling out ectopic pregnancy if you find yourself in their office when it is still early.  I would not worry unless you see any symptom or have any reason to believe something is wrong, which by your description you haven't, and even if you do you're already receiving the necessary care and you've got a few good signs that everything is ok.  But the doctor has to take a more cautious approach, they consider the fact that they are seeing you this early a warning sign and take all the necessary precautions, it's a good thing, ectopics are bad, but doesn't mean there is actually anything for YOU to be concerned about.

I've been screened for ectopic pregnancy several times, never was anything to it, and to answer your other question it is probably the combo of going off your meds and wild hormones making you feel crazy.  It will be ok."

&gt; It's because punching (like running) is a highly-coordinated activity that relies on proprioceptive feedback throughout the motion to work. Since the thalamus clamps down both on the transmission of the motor signals you'd need to effectively complete the motion and the perception of joint-motion data while you're asleep, everything feels bogged down and slow. 

&gt; Compare that to 'flying', which is a), something we can't do normally, so we have no basis for comparison to see if it feels right or not, and b) superman-style flying about doesn't require significant body motion anyway.

LFCMick,AskMen,1388890347.0,"I was recently diagnosed with Clinical Depression, while I can't speak for your boyfriend I can give you somewhat of an insight on what he may be going through. 


There are times where you feel absolutely fine and then all of a sudden it hits you. You feel like absolute shit, you don't want to get out of bed, you lose all motivation and and interest in things that you love doing, there are times when you do feel down, but most of the time you feel just empty inside. These feelings can go on for sometimes days, where it gets to the point where you feel sick of feeling this way, which only makes you feel worse.





Me personally, while I have never had suicidal thoughts, I have come close. My rock bottom was when I was out shopping with my sister, I was in great form when just like *that* it hit me like a wave, I felt horrible, at that time I wished that the ground would just open up and swallow me whole.


As for things to do to get him to smile, just keep doing what you're doing, you have a good sense of humor and that will definitely lift his spirits, as well as any activities you can do as a couple. Other things that are proven to alleviate depression is **exercise, exercise and more exercise**, 3/4 days a week your SO should go for runs, swimming, gym and take up a team sport, not only will he get in better shape it will also boost his serotonin levels (serotonin influences mood and low serotonin levels are linked to Depression), so your SO doesn't feel like he is going through it alone you should also think about doing some of these activities with him so he has someone to relate to and you can grow as a couple. I also recommend he takes up some sort of a hobby, it can be anything as long is it keeps his mind occupied. 


Best of luck OP, hope you and your boyfriend get on great :)

Games are a great way to avoid being real and having real consequences.

Help him by giving real consequences. By letting him game on without you for a while. Don't bother with the 2 evening rest stop for him and see if he changes.

If he doesn't, he loses and you win the chance to find a better game. "

deathsmaash,WTF,1388890686.0,"I had (still have, well my mother took him in) a great cat who was an indoor outdoor and he would always fight the neighborhood cats. On the day of my daughters kindergarten graduation a couple years ago, I pulled down our long driveway and out of the corner of my eye saw a tasmanian devil-style cat fight blur fly under my slow moving car, followed by the characterisic and heartbreaking thump that usually goes with that scenario. I was so fucking scared that I killed our cat til I saw him shoot out and over the hedge, then I saw the scraggly yellow and orange mass quickly scuttle to the bushes. We really had to get to my daughters graduation so I only searched the bushes a few moments and had no luck. Once we returned a few hours later I found the corpse of the tabby cat in the bushes and since I knew we couldnt dig on the property we were renting (we lived just outside a major metropolitan area) I was forced to call the city special waste disposal number and tell them I left the corpse in a sealed cardboard box with several markings that identified its contents. I am still terribly sad about it since I have previously buried several animals in my lifetime, but still... Anyways, leaving your dead stiff dog next to the weekly waste bin...lame.

lasagnaman,hearthstone,1388890767.0,"&gt; this is very different to magic where you are trying to bring the health of a target down to 0. in hearthstone and the wow tcg, you are trying to bring the total damage on the target equal to the target's health.

This is completely wrong and backwards. I haven't played WoW TCG so I can't speak on that, but in Magic you are adding damage to a creature, and when damage equals or exceed the creature's toughness it dies. In Hearthstone the game keeps track of a max health and a current health, and ""damage"" is interpreted as max - current health, NOT a standalone, tracked, statistic."

It's harder if I try to single out a specific person, but it is always successful eventually.

I have once or twice seen arguments about it, and chimed in, asking the person who doesn't want to move ""which picture is you then?"" since we have handy little graphics indicating who the seats are reserved for.

There is this bizarre mentality I've run into that since pregnancy is something you did on purpose it doesn't require their consideration.  So it's luck there is a picture of a pregnant lady on the reduced mobility signs!

You people have it all wrong.

Depression isn't about feeling sad.

It is a lowered (depressed) ability to function. Many times caused by overload of worry and strife.

It loads even more burden on the depressed person to do clown faces and urge them to smile and cheer you up about the situation.

Depression means being unable to complete complicated thoughts, unable to concentrate, forgetting almost instantly what you are about to do.

That makes a person sad.

So - I recommend something more useful. Relaxation therapy. Help him destress with a home spa treatment.

A little exercise and fitness also helps elevate mood. Get outside and feed the homeless or some other fun thing like shoveling snow, making snow men and snow fights and stuff.

That is unless he can also feel guilty about wasting time having fun instead of working

We once got a shower invite for distant family that included a note that said ""we know you're too far away to attend but we wish you could be here!"" with the registry info.  We were unimpressed.

1. private for profit insurance companies, and

2. how expensive care costs (he says he would like ""legislation that makes medical procedures and medicine reasonably priced""). 

Therefore single payer in addition to this legislation he mentions would make costs more tenable and still provide healthcare to the entire population. ACA as is still allows for private companies which are for profit (though I believe their profit margin is limited), and as far as I know doesn't do very much to limit prices for medicine, though I admit I don't know much about that."

Because hooking up is fun, presumably you've been willing at the time and ok with it afterwards thereby not creating a reason to avoid it.

That's about all we can really say based on the information.  He's just as likely to be trying to keep that intimate vibe in case the day comes that you do move to the same city, as he is to be happy making out with someone he's close to but only gets together with from time to time.

&gt; Do I just need to suck it up and admit to myself that this is purely a friends-with-(some) benefits situation that will never go any further?

dewprisms,changemyview,1388893292.0,"&gt; This seems to be very contradictory--specifically when you say we can fulfill our nutrition needs with a vegetarian diet but eating animal flesh is necessary.

We can only fulfill those needs in very specific circumstances, and a large portion of the world is unable to do so due to food availability, lack of available necessary supplements, and lack of funds to do so.

On top of that, one could argue that forcing someone to take nutritional supplements in order to get everything they need in their diet due to optional restrictions and not a medically necessary diet is both unrealistic and abnormal.

&gt; Animals cannot consent either to being killed for food, yet we do not take this as an issue when we do so.

This is why I provided the conditional statement that because it confers no actual benefits to people that is not solely satisfaction of pleasure it is not okay.

Owning pets confers benefits. For some it is security. For some it is nutrition (people who own chickens and cows, for example.) For some it helps with their mental health and well being. People have service animals for handicaps (mental and physical). The onus is on the owner to provide the animal with as optimal a life as possible. It's hardly cruel or unusual to keep animals as pets unless they are severely mistreated, abused, etc. Especially considering the majority of pets that are kept are domesticated specifically for the environments they are kept in.

As for having sex with animals, there is no *need* in any capacity to do this. There are other substitutes if other people seem to not be an option (masturbation, sex toys) or other people who are able to consent and reciprocate."

One, we knew we both liked each other, we actually talked about it one night, but things moved painfully slow.  I think it took another couple of months before we moved to the next step.  The complicated thing was dating, we already ate dinner and went out all the time, it was hard to bridge the gap between ""this is friendly"" and ""this is a date"".

Ultimately, we finally kissed while watching a movie at home.  Where we couldnt bridge the gap by going out on dates, we did bridge the gap being alone at home and cuddling, getting to close each other. 

The other girl is now my wife.  We were friends for a few months, we talked and texted all the time, we ate dinners.  I kinda had a feeling she liked me but wasnt 100% sure.  

Ultimately she went out on a date with another guy.  I was a lil depressed at this and ended up going out with one my exes.  I ended up getting texts from my friend, her date had gotten her drunk and she wanted me to come get her.  I left my ex at the bar and went to where my friend was.  We talked, we danced (drunkenly), she karaoked.  She ended up walking up to me after she sang a song, and giving me that look.  I ended up kissing her.

Also, the Carapace Mace isn't the best weapon to be using. It's nice in that it eventually upgrades into the Dios Edge, but in the meantime you should definitely use something else. 

Barroth is very weak to water until the mud falls off, at which point he becomes immune to water and weak to fire, so maybe use a water weapon. He's also weak to Ice regardless of how much mud is on him (except his body), so that's a good choice too.

This year saw my family and I with a decreased income, as my mom left a job that was eating away at her and remained unemployed until August. I also quit my soul-sucking job as a pizza cook at a certain pizza chain with a bright red roof. 

This meant that the year was spent renting new games and buying old ones. 

Surprisingly, I found myself shifting away from the new games. Admittedly, a lot of it had to do with the fact that I am a collector at heart, so the effect of buying games and seeing my shelves fill up enhances my leanings toward older games. But a lot of it had to with the fact that the older games held my interest better than the new ones. 

I think a perfect example is Oblivion. Skyrim was awesome, don't get me wrong, but it was way too easy. Trust me, that is NOT a problem in Oblivion. I was engaged mentally the whole time I played, and never really relaxed during fights. It brought out the loud, competitive, calculating beast in me. We had not seen each other for a while, so it was quite refreshing. 

Another example would be the older Tom Clancy games. You know, Vegas 1 and 2, Advanced Warfighter 1 and 2. These games had awesome graphics and gameplay for the time in which they were released. And I had tons of fun just going crazy online with people. 

I also discovered this year that I really like Tactical games. Specifically, Xcom: Enemy Unkown. 

When it was released in the 2K Essentials pack with Borderlands and Bioshock, I knew I had to get it. Like I said before, me and my more calculating, thoughtful side hadn't met in a while. High School tends to do that to people, especially when that's what I'm supposed to do every other day in AP classes. Instead of being another side of me, It just became a small piece of my everyday nature. To see it come out fully just....*invigorates* me. 

Anyway, I rambled on and this will be buried anyway. Just thought it would be nice to share. Love you guys! Happy New Year!"

AwhMan,gaybros,1388894324.0,"Did you go to an LGBT club social and find that the people were like that? Or was it just the committee(is there a committee? I'm not so sure how american universities do stuff)? Because a lot of the time the committee can be very SJWish but the people who just like to turn up to socials are just regular everybodies. There's a reason for that though, passionate people get shit done. 

If you don't like the club though why not try and make your own Gaybros club? I can guarantee there'll be other gay dudes who feel the same. It often seems that cis gay men approach LGBT societies/clubs and dislike them because really all they want is a gay male drinking society, or something more like this subreddit, but in society/club form, and while having a space like that is often needed and not at all negative - It's not an LGBT society/club. 

An LGBT society/club in my opinion has a responsibility of inclusion and wellbeing. Every event should be as accessible as possible to absolutely everyone in the community and sadly in my experience cis gay guys tend to be the most venomously opposed to that on principle. And it's such a shame to me. "

China is the [top producer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources) of renewable energy. The USA is second, third behind the EU.

**NOT TO MENTION** That on top of all this, the US and the rest of the West is the *main fucking reason* there is so much manufacturing in China. The pollution. The energy use."

Makes sense? For example, I have a huge crush on Anne Hathaway. But outside of screen, specialy in interviews, she isn't that hot, almost feels boring most of the time. But her work in The Dark Knight Rises or Love and Other Drugs is hot as fuck. Actors know how to be whatever they want to be. You don't see much musicians there, nor writers or even movie makers. I know the idea of money and fame can be a turn on, but you real think that that is what are making this guys desirable?

* Was on it's _3rd string_ RB... which means that Indy could pull personnel back into coverage (where Alex had been beating them hard in the first half)

* Lost it's #2, then #3 receiving threat (Avery, then Hemingway) meaning that that extra personnel was now covering less talent. It also meant that Indy could blitz on the shitty KC line damn near every down _with impunity_.

Prior to the #2 RB going down, Alex led KC to 28points. After the run game was destroyed, Alex only managed to put two field goals up. I for one, can see the extenuating circumstances at play there. It's not on him at all."

I started taking apart controllers a few years ago. I was actually fixing them, as I have a bit of an anger problem and like to smash my controllers into the floor. When my mom told me she wasn't going to buy me any more controllers, I had to come up with a new plan. 

So I took a couple of broken ones I still had laying around apart. I quickly realized that by simply popping some pieces out of one, I could fix the other. So I did. That started my love affair with electronics. 

I now regularly take apart controllers to customize them in various ways, fro, adding lighter springs to Xbox controllers to adding LED lights inside controllers to painting the actually body of the controller. 

And now, I am going to college in the fall for electrical engineering. So yeah, props to you, man! "

When most people have minor disputes they will be direct about it and things will actually be dealt with but an annoyingly significant proportion of women will not, they'll try to deal with things by referring to it without any actual confrontation which can often result in a situation escalating as their message never gets across. When men behave this way other people, as there is no stigma against a woman for calling out a man on something, will call them on it and ensure that they know it isn't going to get the point across, that one can state that they have a problem with something without creating issues. When women behave this way nobody calls them out on it, men often feel that we can't (societal stigma and all that) yet women (who often complain about others acting this way) rarely explain to these individuals why what they're doing is idiotic. Most of the time when women act like this it's because they want to appear a certain way (often simply a subconscious need to do so) which results in them doing things that they don't want to or being ""friends"" with people they hate, plenty of women complain about this happening yet seem unwilling to change themselves or confront those that do this."

Although I guess that would be grandparents to most redditors. 

The problem is that you are forgetting the background but continuing the original harm. This is how cultural racism continues. This is how blacks are considered thugs, even if they are middle class. This is how police are more likely to arrest a black person than a white. This is why blacks are more likely to go to prison than a white. These things happen because the ideas get into the subconscious and are not stopped and addressed. Instead redditors act all offended over being called on something then they whine that they didn't know. "

Jess_than_three,AskReddit,1388895754.0,"I don't know that this really holds up, but it seems to me as though - if you take a single-timeline view (rather than allowing for branching timelines) - the development of time travel would be self-extenguishing. Like: someone develops a time machine; goes back in time; changes things; now one of two things happens:

1. This change leads to the circumstances that led up to the time machine's development not occurring at all, or

2. (and this seems vastly less likely) it doesn't - and the time machine keeps being used

In case #2, each time someone goes back into the past, you have to iterate through that again, and sooner or later (""sooner"" or ""later"", I guess) someone's going to do something that prevents it from ever having been developed.

So then the timeline is altered, sure, but that doesn't prevent *any* time machine from *ever* being developed, surely. Sooner or later someone does, and we're back to the above situation.

This continues until by happenstance a timeline shakes out in which, by whatever happenstance, nobody *ever* develops a time machine, and *that* timeline is stable.

Presumably, *that* timeline must be **our** timeline; if retrograde time travel was possible but inherently unstable, then ours must be the final, retrograde-time-travel-free result. Or at least, that seems intuitively correct to me, but I couldn't  say why.

Alternatively,

I really like the concept of branching timelines. Here's a (terrible, MSPaint-ed) diagram for funsies:

I don't think he's perfect, though: there are several lines that Matt Smith read which I found to be incredibly stupid. His speech at the end of ""Closing Time,"" for example. ""Daddy's back!"" I understand he's using his ""I'm audacious and I've outsmarted you!"" voice, but that was a misfire. There are a few more examples of this, but I cannot think of them right now.

Ah yes, favorite Matt Smith stories (in no order whatsoever):

1. The Eleventh Hour
2. The Power of Three
3. The Snowmen
4. The Almost People
5. Vincent and the Doctor

That was actually incredibly hard. I tried coming up with the episodes that most strongly resonated in me, due to the storytelling or plot of those five episodes.

* The Day of the Doctor

* The Time of the Doctor

* The Doctor's Wife

discofreak,atheism,1388895856.0,"Sorry to not get back to this until after you have been downvoted. You are correct that descent of humans from a common ancestor with apes is not a scientific fact, in the sense that it will never be experimentally replicated in the lab. But it is a fact in the 'common use' sense -- that there is so much evidence that it is ridiculous to not rely on it to try to understand the world. 

Calling evolution a fact is not disservice; it does show ignorance to the semantic difference between 'fact' and 'theory', but colloquial use of the second word implies that the theory of evolution can be challenged by fundamentalists with no working knowledge of genetics or anything else. This is an unfortunate consequence of the semantic difference, that common linguistics imply something entirely different from an expert's understanding of the exact definition of the words and the subject.

This is why I will never refer to evolution as ""just a theory"". This is apt to be misinterpreted as something that will be challenged by someone who just feels supremely confident, for whatever delusional reason, that their belief system is as profound as the strength of their confictions, and that they know in a sense that is superior to scientific methods, that their beliefs are enlightened and of absolute truth, that the theory of evolution is only one possible explaination for the things we see around us.

Well, I looked up Talia's Wikipedia page and the only time I can see her and Bruce being in Metropolis at the same time was around the time of Superman/Batman #6 where she was running LexCorp while Luthor was the president of the US. It's either that, something I didn't find, or just something in the Arkhamverse. I agree, I think it is its own universe. Arkham City has Nightwing in it and the Robin there is Tim Drake. On the other hand, the 1992 animated series skipped Todd's tenure as Batman entirely, it went from Grayson to Drake. I think they're skipping over the events from Death in the Family where Jason Todd died since they revived him anyway. That happened in a Hush story, and since Hush came into being in Arkham City I'm inclined to think they just wrote Jason Todd out in the Arkhamverse. "

IIRC, most of the new chips have specific counts for holding the button down to get to each different selection mode. Try looking up the chip and seeing whether it has different timings, and that should help!

ninja edit: just googled 'em cus I'm fucking bored anyways. Found this link as one of the first: http://www.raveready.com/iMax-SP-LED-Light-Chip-p/costmxisp.htm

It says in here that you first choose the mode, then you choose the color - from your post, it sounds like you're just holding down the button, and then you choose the color. Try holding it down for ***precisely 1.5 seconds*** and then it should be switching through the modes; from there, you can hold it down again, and it'll go to color switching mode. Hope that helps!

double edit: remember, double clicking the button allows you to leave the selection mode, btw. And taking out the batteries should effectively 'clear' the memory, and basically give it a reset - this doesn't work all the time though."

xenvy04,atheismrebooted,1388897004.0,"I used to feel astral projection or out of body experiences often when I was younger, because I suffered from sleep paralysis. It's gone away since I started college, but I think you'd be interested in reading the [pathophysiology and signs and symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis#Pathophysiology) section of this Wikipedia article.

On the topic of biochemistry, I'm a chemistry major and I had some trouble with this even after I began identifying as an atheist. I enrolled in a course on molecular and cellular biology last spring, and the winter before I really couldn't fathom the idea that life was nothing more than chemistry. I think that, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that as I broke down what I knew already about cellular biology in my head, the only answer could be chemistry. If I asked myself, for example, how anything ""knew"" to do what it did, there was simply no other response. I remembered from it being drilled in my head that the mitochondria make energy. Now if I ask, how do they *know* to make energy, the more ridiculous answers are clearly ""a life spirit,"" ""a soul,"" or to think of the DNA as ""speaking to them"" (not through biochemistry, but as if they speak English like characters. ""You! Make more energy!"") The obvious and only answer is, ""a series of biochemical reactions.""

And as I went through the course and learned more about those reactions, I became more grounded in this idea that life is nothing more than chemistry. And I realize that there are still questions scientists haven't answered, but I think enough have been answered that there isn't really room for a soul.

I recommend you find a textbook on cellular biology and see how you feel after reading it. [Whichever you prefer](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=molecular%20and%20cellular%20biology&amp;sprefix=molecular+and+cellu%2Caps&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Amolecular%20and%20cellular%20biology) (if money is an issue, ^^^piratebay ^^^is ^^^always ^^^an ^^^(option)). Sorry if that sounds condescending; I don't mean it in a ""read a book!"" kind of way. I just wonder if maybe you would feel the same way after reading it.

McNiells work seems to reflect more of a heavy occult tone than anything else. Anyone who's watched Indiana Jones remembers that the Nazis were (supposedly) big on occult paraphernalia. Perhaps McNiell is obsessed with the occult, and as a result has a distorted conspiratorial perspective of the Third Reich and is enthralled by the intriguing attributes of its *fuhrer* while ignoring or dismissing the extremely important failures as a rational human being. It's not uncommon for people to downplay the faults of those who are powerful and/or successful because they can't relate to the victims. Imagine how the descendants of the Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, Choctaw, and Chickasaw people felt when they first saw Andrew Jackson printed on the 20$ bill.

half_lurker,intj,1388898123.0,"I have different era's of friends, School, College, groups from the different places that I have lived, and a small group in the town I live now. These friends are usually met and kept through common activities, like biking, or being in the same program in school, or I have worked with them, so I would see them regularly and we could talk about what we were doing and make plans from there.

I have never really be an initiator and because of that I have been left out before. I never really took offense to it, probably because logically I know that is in the past and so being upset by it won't help. I might say ""Let me know next time you go laser tagging"" and that is all there is to it for me. 

So to answer you questions:

&gt;Am I being too sensitive?

That is a bit too sensitive for me, but everyone is different and you are entitled to your feelings.

&gt;Should I make more of an effort to reach out to people?

If you feel that making a effort would include you more to that group and that is desirable, then yes do that.

&gt;Should I just let old friends stay in the past?

I enjoy keeping i touch with my old friends, and on the rare occasion that we will be in the same area we make plans to meet up if we can, but no hurt feelings if schedules don't work Life is busy, that is why it takes effort to keep in touch.

&gt;I'm so used to being called and not being the one who calls others.

Then say so, keeping it to yourself will not prevent it from happening in the future.

&gt;I'm hoping some fellow INTJs will understand and give some insight or warmth. Feels bad.

I am not very great with warmth of feels, but it is not the end of the world, and it was kinda out of your control that someone more than likely simply forgot to invite you. Life happens.

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1388898245.0,"When somebody complains to me about a problem they've caused this way I do, more often than not it's a guy complaining about problems they're having with a girl because they're both doing this (it's always she's made at him for what seems like nothing, he's too scared to confront her about it and find out what's wrong but is still annoyed). I know why guys that act this way do it, what I wanted was a reason beyond appearances that women will act this way. I like knowing what makes people tick, how they think. I find it makes people easier to handle, I don't deal well with two-faced individuals (or at least two-faced for petty reasons) so I tend to distance myself from them and thus when I'm forced to deal with them it's more taxing.

I've found that when something can either be innocuous or insulting it's best to assume it's the former and find out if it's the latter. By assuming something to be innocent you avoid confrontation with those who mean nothing and reserve the right to confront those who meant something.

Not_Han_Solo,AskMen,1388898359.0,"Okay, this is coming from a guy who has, and has in the past, struggled with depression.

Humor/laughter is not a cure for depression.  Many people with no first-hand experience with depression don't understand, and think it's a state of sadness which is, by its nature, opposite to happiness.  They think that laughter is the apex point of happiness, and that depression is the nadir point of sadness.  **This is not true**.  In point of fact, trying to force laughter can make a person's depression worse because it throws the perceived wretchedness of their life into a more stark contrast, the way that a little dash of a contrasting color in the shaded area of a painting can make the colors 'pop'.  It puts the pressure, the burden, of being happy--a state which is or can be a nigh-impossibility for a depressed person--increase upon the depressed individual.  *We're supposed to be happy.  We're not.  We've failed at that too.  God, what a wretched excuse for a human being we are.*  This is, more or less, the thought process.

As others have noted, depression results when the pressures of life become insurmountable, when stress is overwhelming, or when worry is incapacitating.  If you want to help your boyfriend, you need to understand the source of his depression.  Once you do, **help him**.  Not in the ""I'm here for you, honey"" way--in the pick up a tool and help him with his tasks or stressors way.  You don't ask him.  You don't stop when he complains.  You get your hands dirty and with the sweat of your brow and the tears from your eyes show him that he is not alone.  

Being depressed is like being utterly alone in an uncaring world which exists only to destroy you, to grind you into dust, and to celebrate your utter annihilation.  It is the product of environment, and must be dealt with as such.  More than anything, though, there's nothing that says, as powerfully or as indisputibly, that the black heart of depression, that sense of utter isolation, is false than the unflagging presence of a loved one, right there helping.

In many ways, it's a lot like the climax of *What Dreams May Come*, where Robin Williams' character gives up on everything to spend an eternity in mindless torture alongside his wife rather than leaving her to suffer that torment alone.  No words can match up to that act, and the act itself can carry tremendous significance."

As Allie puts it: ""And that's the most frustrating thing about depression. It isn't always something you can fight back against with hope. It isn't even something — it's nothing. And you can't combat nothing. You can't fill it up. You can't cover it. It's just there, pulling the meaning out of everything. That being the case, all the hopeful, proactive solutions start to sound completely insane in contrast to the scope of the problem.

It would be like having a bunch of dead fish, but no one around you will acknowledge that the fish are dead. Instead, they offer to help you look for the fish or try to help you figure out why they disappeared.""

CrazyPlato,AskMen,1388898517.0,"First off, you're 17. Of course you aren't going to be attracted to women in their 40s. When the age difference is less then twenty years from you, they'll start to be more interesting. In fact, as you get older, you'll learn that counting years becomes pretty impractical: in high school you can tell what year someone is in just by looking at them, but the more years you get under your belt, the more ages start to blend together.

Secondly, I'm betting you won't have to worry nearly as much about aging as you think, because I assume you're male by posting here. Women tend to worry about age, because most beauty traits that they are taught to value are elements of youth. Guys can get older, and the traits we value for attractiveness aren't affected int he same way. It's the reason so many ""attractive"" celebrities are older men: the views we share about ""silver foxes"" are way different than those we share about ""cougars"".

And of course, there's the fact that beauty and attractiveness are more than physical features. A guy with a good personality can overcome a lot of features that aren't textbook sexy. 

If you really need affirmation about this, look at your dad. You're probably going to look like him as you get older, and you know for sure that at least one woman finds him attractive at that age. So, logically, aging can't be the worst thing to happen to you."

No, I know that's why they sided defacto with the other people in the anti-morsi camp, even if they didn't agree with them-- they just knew that the anti-islamist groups made up a very large percentage of the population and would have the backing of state security and the army.

&gt; The fact you don't understand their intentions doesn't mean they're pro-Morsi

Well I understand the more aggressive Salafi/Salafi Jihadi desire to create an entity that espouses the Salafi view as the only legitimate/state view.

I'm not saying that they are explicitly pro-Morsi; just that in the current situation they're going to side with MB style Islamists over siding with the military and the people in the various anti-MB organizations and political parties.

&gt; The fact they are protesting in favour of the current military regime and participate in it show they aren't - as you claim - allied with the MB. 

Right now they're not, or at least I haven't heard of ""Salafis standing alongside secularist groups and pro-military groups"".

Aggressive Salafis were engaging in some of the sectarian violence after Morsi was ousted, right? Also the Salafi Jihadis/Zawahirians in Sinai attacking the army and the police."

If you take an unsocialized chihuahua to a dog park...it's probably going to hide under a bench and snarl at dogs that approach.  You take an unsocialized pit to a dog park and you might end up with human injuries as they try to separate an incredibly powerful dog from a fight.

I know this because I was definitely guilty of this for a time. My first step into the queer community was coming out as transgender, and before I was a pretty little (mostly straight) white girl having grown up in rural england. The culture shock from (on face value) being treated pretty fucking decently to well... Being treated like a perverted freak for being transgender I spent basically an entire year in bed completely depressed with a massive chip on my shoulder and my LGBT society basically stopped me from becoming and awful human being, because I got to meet so many people with so many different experiences. I met other transgender people who had gotten on with their lives instead of just wallowing. A close trans guy friend of mine is a recovering alcoholic and heroin addict, had to be sectioned for trying to kill his dad when his schizophrenia was undiagnosed and he's only just turned 20. And now he's just a regular guy doing positive work within the community, and it's like, if people like that can just get on with it then what the fuck is my problem? Most people have shit in their life but if all you do is focus on the negativity it consumes you, and it's so important to realise and learn from other peoples struggles as well. I'm not going to sit here and whine about how oppressed I am when I could be doing actual positive things instead. 

I may have gone off track a bit there. I just wish people had a little bit more empathy, because that's where a lot of bullshit comes from, people just not seeing someone elses situation or refusing to. "

It works ok for what you want to do, but honey still ferments really well, enough that the yeast will really push the limits of its tolerance before crapping out. If you really want to reduce the ABV, I'd use ale yeast and consider reducing the amount of honey you use (I did a later batch with only 1.5# honey to a gallon batch, and it came up at about 8%ABV). You may also consider the affect this will have on the taste: a lot of the honey will be turned into alcohol, and a low-ABV mead won't be strong enough to have that distinct wine-like taste. It may just taste dry, and wanting for a bit of flavor. If you have any experience with it, you might consider back-sweetening the mead to give it a bit of that honey flavor back (not really in my wheelhouse, so I won't pretend to know how to do it properly)."

They used to be the same breed but it was split in two maybe 100 years ago.

Since then, their lines have been completely separate and they are considered to be two different breeds.  The average person would have an impossible time trying to tell the difference between the two.

Now, do you really think the Walton's and Koch brothers are going to change their views and policies regarding poor people and individuals of different races with implementation of a libertarian-type society? Somehow I doubt it, but here's to hoping! *cheers* 

Edit: so i totally forgot that david koch is actually one of america's biggest philatrapist.  "

A pro jeweler will probably try to upsell you to a diamond by talking about the brittleness but unless you do something crazy while wearing it, I don't see an issue.  I'd go for synthetic for this stone, it'd be cheaper and stronger since it won't have any imperfections. 

If you want a less brittle stone, look at corundum (sapphires and rubies are both forms of corundum).  It is a bit more expensive, but it's not brittle and it is very hard. Synthetic corundum comes in basically any color and is very cool looking!

discofreak,atheism,1388900528.0,"False. To the general public, sure. But to the genetics scientist, there is no more powerful tool than assumption of the theory of evolution.

There is little progress that would be made in the field without accepting that the theory of evolution is reasonable.

Most people don't see this though, so I understand any rejection. As a genetics expert, I can tell you that rejection is naive. I have personally made one discovery in particular that can easily be explained by accepting that evolution has been going on for millions of years. For experts in the field this is a common occurence -- no big deal. Unfortunately, most non-experts will never personally engage the primary data on such a level.

So what I'm saying is that, yes, it is there. And it is there in spades to those who actually use it in their jobs."

JAWJAWBINX,autism,1388901031.0,"There is no correlation between head size and autism, any studies suggesting one have either been debunked, improperly run, or had a corrupted sample in some way.

A child doesn't become autistic. An autistic child doesn't disappear behind any walls at some point, we don't disappear, we don't have less capacity, we aren't less able to be happy (though the way we are commonly treated because the horrible and horribly incorrect things people think about us certainly makes it harder to be as happy as others). We don't need to be cured and the only way it can be reversed is if we were never born, we are autistic from the second our brain first starts to form. If you are to lose your son it is not because he leaves, it is because you separate yourself from him. It is because you can't accept him and instead believe him to be inferior, that there's something keeping you from your ""real"" child.

I hope you educate yourself on what autism really is, I hope you learn just how wrong and harmful so much of what you've written here is, I hope that you don't abandon your son in a pitiful search for some ""cure,"" I hope your son never finds out that you thought these things. Just remember, if you continue on the path you're on and he is autistic then every time you look in the mirror you'll be looking at your son's worst enemy. Fight for him, fight for his happiness, fight to ensure that nobody thinks of him as being subhuman, fight that nobody will think the way that you are right now in the future, fight so that he won't need to see something like this and have his heart break for the child in that note, fight so that he doesn't need to spend every moment of his life pretending to be somebody that he isn't, fight for your son.

Barring that I hope he learns young that no matter what his father may say or do that he isn't worse for who he is, that he isn't alone, that he has worth no matter who hard people may be trying to take it from him, that there are people out there fighting for him, that there are people fighting so that the kids who come after him will bet treated better, that there are people out there that want to get to know who he really is, that he is as human as the next person, that the people who try to hurt him are tell him he has no value are the ones that are truly worthless and inhuman, that he people who have never met him care so much that his pain hurts them, that there are people who would suffer the cruelties of the world in his place if they could so that he wouldn't need to.

You have a simple choice to make right now, will you accept the child you have or abandon them for the one who exists solely in your imagination. Please make the right one."

I was also not aware that Azanor had changed his stance regarding permission to include his mod in modpacks, outside of packs made by certain groups.  As far as I know, AT Launcher is not one of those groups.  The same goes for the stance of Benimatic with regard to the Twilight Forest mod.

We don't have roaming packs of unassimilated angry Muslims.  And hell, there are areas all over France where the police don't even go.  Prob murders there without anyone even knowing!

It is very regrettable that we have people in this country that murder each other all the time, and I hope that changes, but unless you are visiting one of those areas, you will find that the US is very safe.  I've lived in the NYC area my whole life and have never had one incident.  In Europe I had some scumbag in Dublin try to steal my wallet, assholes in Termini train station in Rome trying to direct me down dead end halls, and trying to unzip my backpack.  "

famouscomposer,AskReddit,1388902274.0,"In high school, there was this really exceptionally hot girl.  The only time she ever acknowledged me was when she was making fun of me for wearing hand-me-downs or having a giant curly blond afro.

About 2 or 3 years after high school, she added me on facebook.  She had put on a *little* weight, but still looked pretty good.  Since high school, I had gotten a job, a haircut, real clothes... well you get the idea.  So I accepted her request, and chatted her up and we hung out.  She blew me within 15 minutes of *parking outside my house.*  Then she drove us both back to her house, where we had really short. barely enjoyable, unprotected sex.  I did her from behind while she was standing up bent over her couch.  Her younger sister (who was over 18) was one room over.

So afterwards I ""fell asleep""  and when I was sure *she* was asleep, I left.  I walked home.  I walked three hours home. The three hour long walk of shame.  It was awful.  Still, it felt good to prove to myself that I could do it."

sockmonkeysaurus,TwoXChromosomes,1388902305.0,"A lot of these women that you compare yourself to are probably doing the exact same thing to you, comparing themselves to you and feeling inadequate about certain qualities in themselves compared to you. Everyone has insecurities. The people that you compare yourself to do. Models in magazines do. TV stars and entertainers do. Everyone does.

Everyone has qualities about themselves that other people are going to see and wish that they had for themselves. And everyone is going to be blind to their own qualities that maybe other people are jealous of. You have to realize that you are putting blinders on to your own qualities when you look at the qualities in other women and feel poorly about yourself. For example, when you look at your roommate with the long legs, and feel inadequate for not having legs like hers, you won't notice how maybe when you smile, you have a really cute dimple. And when you feel poorly because she's a blonde and you aren't, you won't notice how you have really good posture, or how toned your legs are, or how fit you are overall.

It's completely normal to compare yourself to others. But realize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Just because you haven't had someone outwardly express interest in you doesn't mean that people out there haven't looked at you and thought ""wow, she's really pretty"", or ""I wish I had [X] like she does."" 

Whenever I find myself making comparisons between myself and someone else, I try to include one of my qualities in it. Like maybe I'm walking along, and I see another really attractive woman. I might think to myself ""Wow, I wish I had boobs like hers. But I have really toned arms, so it's ok."" Or ""I wish I could walk in heels like she does, but my hair looks great today, so I got that going for me"". So I'm comparing myself to someone, but at the same time, noticing some quality about myself that makes me feel good."

I used pencil for years and years, and then one day got a gel liner with a brush.  A few practices and it was just cake.  There's something about gliding the brush over the eye that just gives such a nice straight line.

I usually do a tiny bit at a time as I go across the eye...and then I go back after its mostly covered and do a sweep across the eye to get it straight.  The flick at the end is the hardest part and that took me maybe a month of practice to finally get it right.

Another product I really liked was the Stila 24-7 liner.  It's a super fine tipped pen so you just have to do a lot of coloring in to get it all done...but with such a small tip I felt like it was pretty forgiving.

AwhMan,gaybros,1388903888.0,"Yes, with my friend that's what I mean. That if he can keep going despite all of his struggles then so can I. I know he's not perfect and not an angel and he's kind of a spoilt brat a lot and struggles everyday with it but he's still here and he's still trying. We help each other out a lot when we're feeling low. 

I grew up in a very hegemonic environment, everyone was white and from pretty much the same social background. Everyone was just kind of born there and died there, not exactly a good place for widening your experiences. 

And that's what I mean about empathy, you don't have to, understand other people have shit as well. And another thing that pisses me off about SJW types is that they don't do fucking anything constructive. They just have petty arguments and yell at people on the internet. And taking such an aggressive stand point only alienates people. No one's going to change their mind with you yelling in their face. 

And yeah, that last bit pisses me off too. Our society has different representatives for different groups within the community so we try and get good representation. Transgender people are often so badly represented because all of the media about us is made by cis people, even the sympathetic stuff. I'm so fed up of ""Tranny's on holiday!!"" type documentaries about trans women getting SRS, or roles where you can't actually figure out if the character is a drag queen or a trans person because the writer clearly has no idea what the distinction is. The only realistic portrayal of a trans person is in orange is the new black. 2 years ago I was the trans* rep for the society and I dressed in drag for something, like 5 other guys did it, no biggie right? Wrong. A cis girl on the committee took issue with it and ranted in my face about how I'm a disgrace to trans men and that no real trans person would ever do that. Like... Yeah, you definitely have the experience to back that view point up there, want me to tell you about how you should be wearing dresses seeing as you're a woman?

The logic carries over here by allowing ties. Now instead of two possible results per game, there are three. But the logic remains the same. So with two games, we'd expect 3^(2) = 9 possibilities. Let's see if it checks out. (WW, WL, WT, LW, LL, LT, TT, TW, TL). Checks out. With 9 games, there are 3^(9) possibilities. That's about 20,000 possibilities.

Any given person will have a one in 20,000 (1/20,000) chance in getting it completely correct. Or about 0.005%. Of course, the chance of you getting it correct is independent of anyone else. What are the chances that *someone*, anyone, out of the 900 people get it all correct? That's simply 900/20,000. It's identical to you taking 900 guesses, or a 1/20,000 chance 900 separate times, or 900/20,000. That's about 4.5%, and assuming all 900 of you choose separate results.

Possible, but unlikely."

Not really no.  GST (the federal goods and services tax) is sort of a VAT, but not all provinces have GST independently as they harmonize it with their provincial sales taxes.  

Provincial sales taxes are well, sales taxes, not VAT's.  And all  3 (PST, GST and HST)  are usually applied after the sticker price.  HST, is a uniform tax rate for all goods and services- essentially PST and GST can apply to different things, HST applies to anything that gets taxed.  Or at least that's the idea.  Anytime you involve money and lawyers there are always exceptions.  

VAT in the way you describe it is only really standard in Europe, China and some of south america.  A few other places have VAT systems that aren't everywhere or that are  likely to be implemented in future.

I enjoy shows that find ways to make the mundane feel extraordinary or special, as though life was more than just the ""highlight reels"" which seem to compose *every* episode of a sci-fi or fantasy drama.

Depending on the judge, they'll often drop the charges altogether if you agree to go to ""drug court,"" where you're sentenced, so to speak, to attending a drugs-and-alcohol-ruined-my-life seminar, and that will be the end of it. Nobody cares, so I'm not surprised by that cop's reaction."

BadVogonPoet,Parenting,1388906418.0,"First of all, I think it's amazing that you care so much that you're trying to find a way to make peace. This is an awful situation that you and your Dad definitely don't deserve to be in. 

I'm sorry this woman ripped your family apart. It's not fair to you or your Dad. There could be any number of reasons why she acted the way she did but trying to figure out why she did it is an exercise in futility. I think it's human nature to try to figure out a person's motivation because it makes us feel better to know the why behind a situation but the process of getting there can be traumatizing. 

Simply based on what you said, I don't think this woman deserves to have you in her life but I'd suggest taking your cues from your Dad, provided he doesn't take the position of allowing her to continue steamrolling over him. If it were me, I'd cut off contact with her completely to remove her ability to manipulate you any more than she already has. 

As far as you and your Dad are concerned, there's a long road of healing and it's going to be a lot more rough as he deals with her betrayal. If family counseling for you and your Dad is possible, it can be a great help. If not, just be there for him. Listen to him talk or cry if he needs to. Try to stay positive and avoid actively bad mouthing her. Not that she doesn't deserve it, it just doesn't help the situation.

Chances are you and your Dad will come out of this with a much stronger relationship but it's going to take a long time to get there.

Constam,whowouldwin,1388906438.0,"I really don't think people are giving Spider-Man's reactions to the force based attacks much credit. Maybe he couldn't dodge them (unless someone was using the force to throw objects) but he's tough enough not to just stand there and die. Mace starts choking him, he'd use his webs. All it takes is snagging Mace with one good shot and it's over. Spider-Man is much, much stronger than Mace Windu, all it would take is one powerful swing of Mace on the end of a web-line and Mace goes splat. 

And ""blasted away at stupidly fast speeds so that he can't even stop himself"" is physically impossible to do to someone that can stick to the ground. Even if that was ripped up too, his acrobatic stunts allow him to recover from being thrown by guys like the Hulk. The force wouldn't propel him any faster in comparison. Also, he has webs, safely stopping someone moving at stupidly fast speeds is one of their primary functions.

The Mace Windu we see in the movies would be an even match for Spider-Man. If you include the things he could do in The Tartakovsky cartoon, not so much. He's a little overpowered. He disassembled a battle droid with the force in a second, no reason he couldn't do that to a human body. He wouldn't, except as a last resort, but he could. However, that Mace Windu could have obviously done the same to anyone else, including Sidious... and yet he didn't even try. In every instance of him fighting, he chooses to rely on the lightsaber first and foremost. He only started fighting with the force when he *lost* the lightsaber. Spider-Man is good at dodging swords, glowy or otherwise. Would Mace Windu break character and rip him apart with the force in time or not? Spider-Man wouldn't immediately go for a kill shot but he'd know from his spider-sense that Mace Windu was very dangerous so he probably wouldn't pull any punches."

statusrobot,AskWomen,1388906447.0,"I think goal is fine. Getting married isn't something that just magically happens, so this goal changes the way that I date. I approach my relationships with the goal of getting married - of making a lifetime commitment with the other person. I date people I can see myself with in the long term, and who are interested in me in the same way. I make sure we're compatible in important ways, and focus on creating a relationship that will be healthy for a long time. Both of us work toward that goal (and if it's not a goal he's also interested in, then we don't date). If we find that we don't think we'll be compatible over the long haul, we break up and I look for someone new. All of that sounds like pursuing a goal to me.

It's different from, say, losing 5 pounds, sure. Setting a deadline on it is a bad plan, for example. But most major life goals require someone else's input - getting a promotion, for example, requires not just that you do a good job but that the right person notice it and the circumstances line up such that they can do something about it.

A goal is something you want that you're willing to work for, IMO. Different goals have to be approached in different ways, but if they fit that basic definition then they're all still goals."

In the same way that so much pressure is put on girls to look pretty, be slim, have large breasts (media , generally guys don't actually think this), that same pressure is on men to be 'manly'. Not being able to get an erection is pretty much the biggest hit to your ego for many guys, especially as it seems like your own body is letting you down (literally). I can see many guys not wanting to go through that. I have suffered with it for many years. First time I'm with most girls I get stage fright, I'm nervous it will happen again, which adds to the stress and then I can't perform. But I've found that if I talk to my partner, explain what is going on then it's better, especially as everyone I've been with has been very patient and understanding. But it's not always easy to talk about. It took me a long time to come to terms with it and think, Fuck it, being scared isn't gonna solve anything. And if the person I'm with doesn't understand, don't want to fuck em anyway.

I believe that a lot of our struggles on offense are in large part because Bevell's playcalling has been pretty vanilla the last few games...pretty much ever since we clinched a playoff spot. That's normal, however; teams tend to save the tricky stuff for the playoffs so it won't show up on film. For example, I recall during the playoffs last year it was said a few times that the 49ers did not run the Pistol formation at all in the regular season, then ran it very often in the playoffs. Because of that they embarrassed the Packers in the Divisional round and went to the Super Bowl. 

Our offense should play with both more motivation as well as more creative playcalling, adding up to much more production."

Sherlock and John's faces.

That sounds so weird, I know, but let me explain, because they just broke my heart.

Sherlock: 

1. Basically anything regarding John in the episode. Just the sheer amount of joy and relief his face had after John finally looked at him in the restaurant. Even though he was teasing John about his mustache, Sherlock looked like he was drinking in the most amazing thing he could ever find. It was gut wrenching. 

2. In the train car when John was forgiving him (as an aside, I really believe that the speech John gave about him being the best and wisest man as probably the speech John couldn't tell his therapist in Richenbach.) Sherlock knows the bomb has been disarmed but he looks so moved by John's speech... its genuine... until he can't help laughing cuz the bomb is off.

3. His look of utter horror upon meeting Molly's fiance. He has a complete conversation with John without saying a damn thing out loud and its brilliant.

John:

1. Everything. JUST EVERYTHING... seeing Sherlock, reacting to #notdeadbtw, thinking Sherlock was the old guy trying to sell him porn, shaving (but not for Sherlock), stuck in the bonfire, in the tunnels, in the train car, JUST EVERYTHING. 

2. I literally have no words for the amazing job Martin Freeman did in this episode. I am dumbstruck.

Renner1,worldpolitics,1388907949.0,"&gt; However, I've begun to see the anti-Semitic links to opposition of Israel. For everyone intelligently making their case (you), they're many more who simple don't like the dirty Jews.

Yes, anti Zionism can be abused by people who don't like the Jews because they're jews. 

However, and especially because anti-Zionism comes under a lot more scrutiny, and since the Israelis will scream ""anti Semitism"" whenever they get the chance, the anti Zionist movement really has had to finesse itself, become very clear as to what the issues are.

As opposed to those supporters of Israel who are openly racist or openly in favour of ethnic cleansing and yet the same people who scrutinize and accuse anti Zionism of being genocidal or racist are falling over themselves to appease the pro-Israel racists.

The person you linked seems to be severely confused, especially considering his stint in the French ""racial nationalist"" party. A good ""example"" for Zionists and Israelis to use-- the same as they would use some screaming Salafi Jihadi lunatic-- so that they could say, falsely, ""opposition to Israeli actions is vile anti Semitism""."

I'd also try to focus on making both of the eyes even because since the right has a bit more of the darker color on the center top it shows up as a splotch when your eyes are open (see last pic in album).

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1388908608.0,"I'm definitely not an eye makeup genius, but if you're frustrated with eyeshadow I think I might be able to help a bit: 

Get brushes. I thought brushes were a scam and there was no way that someone could need all of those so I tried to apply *all* of my makeup with a concealer brush starting out. If you don't already have eye-specific brushes, this could seriously be an overnight fix.  

Put down a base shadow. Helps with blending which you also want to know how to do properly. Don't blend too little so it looks unfinished and don't over blend so it looks like you have sparkly mud on your face. Using a tapered blending brush (i.e. shape of MAC 217--EcoTools has a blending brush in its eye set and so does RT) lightly do little circles along the line of the two colors you're trying to blend.

pinkfu,loseit,1388908983.0,"&gt; Most people would agree that a degree of possessive attitude makes you feel desired and wanted and precious.

This must be a bubble/your mileage may vary, etc. Most people I know would be horrified by this idea unless it was part of some kind of D/s relationship. Even in the context of a (healthy) D/s relationship people are not going to literally base their self worth on that kind of... It just doesn't make a lot of sense. Love isn't about the sexual desire, passion, or feeling precious. That's all... sex. Sex is certainly important but it's a shallow grave to build a relationship on. Life is not Twilight or whatever pop culture epic romance BS of the moment. Love is about understanding, acceptance, trust, communication, and support. Love is infinitely possible to every level, from your pets to your family to your ""significant other"". 

&gt; Without enough respect or consideration, and too much insecurity, possessive behavior can become controlling and manipulative.

What does this... can you rephrase because I have no idea what you're trying to say.  

&gt; But thinking, ""my boyfriend is mine"" does not mean I need therapy.

Well, yes it does if you truly believe it. That would be straight up delusion. No one can own or possess another human except in immoral ways (i.e. not respecting human rights). An extreme is slavery, lesser is jealousy. Jealousy is the word you're avoiding, by the way, since that is what you're actually advocating here.

Jealousy (not to be confused with envy) is a culturally created emotion, not a basic human emotion. (This means that there are entire cultures in which jealousy is a foreign concept or considered unacceptable.) It comes straight from a dysfunction. Jealousy is never, ever, EVER a positive. Jealousy is a form of anger and anxiety. If jealousy moves in to feelings of entitlement (possession) you should seek professional help. Sure, not everyone goes down the train from jealousy to HOMICIDE or something extreme but it very easily could lead to other problems like depression or other self destructive behaviors. 

People often fool themselves thinking jealousy (or whatever you want to call it, possession, mine, whatever) is just part of life because that's the ""norm"" because that's all they see on TV/movies or, sadly, all around them. It's just not. Hell, in my own experience, my own social circles and general monkey sphere, it's just a huge red flag of crazy to avoid.

&gt; I am fully aware that he is his own person. But we are also each other's for the duration of the relationship.

Ah! So you prefer the fairy tale over the reality. Gotcha. Yeah, maybe living in a fantasy is fine for some, but if you find it causing massive amounts of problems (which I would guess comes on hard at breakups) then seek help. 

Personally, I find reality based love to be healthier and vastly more fulfilling. The feeling of someone knowing you, really understanding who you are as a person, and being unconditionally accepted and wanted is vastly more desirable than being ""needed"" because they CANT LIVE WITHOUT ME for that moment. That's just me. "

Girls are a lot closer emotionally as friends than guys are. They talk about everything, nothing is off limits with a very close group of girl friends. So this leads to us just checking in with each other a lot, like ""hey are you going to the party?"" ""yah, what are you wearing?"" it's important not to be too overdressed or underdressed and obviously there's power in numbers so if you're both overdressed, it's okay.

In addition, it's like a security blanket thing. If I show up at a party alone, I'm alone and that can be scary if you don't know anyone there before your friends show up. Plus you know all your closest friends are going to show up together without you if you opt to go alone.

If I show up with all my closest friends, I feel more confident and I've got built in people to talk to if I'm too shy to talk to anyone else. And built in people to protect me if a guy is being scary. (I know most guys are not like this at parties, it's just a constant fear.

So you have hooded eyes so you can do whatever you want. I would probably go a bit more dramatic so people can see your eye makeup when your eyes are open but that's up to you. 

If you're trying to look older, I think I'd pick the matte red color because generally darker lip colors will make lips look thinner which is something that happens when you get older. Contouring more heavily can also give the appearance of having aged."

And this question implies HUGE generalizations about women's decision making skills but I think men and women have different ideas of rationality. Women have definitely thought it through, and have thought through several other outcomes as well. 

Some people make decisions based on their gut instincts, that doesn't make it wrong, that's just how they live their lives. If you can't see eye to eye, it's not always their problem, it's also partly yours.

And as for why they can't see your point of view, empathy is hard to come by in all people.

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1388910083.0,"This is what I was looking for, I like to know what makes people tick because social situations can be draining and the knowledge can help me ensure that I can limit the cost. I was hoping for more of the actively hating people but still acting friendly with them sort of passive aggressiveness, that's the mindset I can't figure out.

I've had some interesting relationships with people like you, they're usually able to be direct with me because they find they need to be at some point to get a point across and I respond so well to them being direct that they continue to be. I've honestly never had anybody like you dislike me in the least (at least as far as I know), then again I've worked hard to ensure that I am generally held in good regard and that those who dislike me do so without reason at least in person. I've known enough to figure out the thought process well enough. Some are scared of confrontation, they simply can't handle it so they do all the can to avoid it. Some are simply submissive and have difficulty standing up to others, even when they wouldn't be their mind twists it into a confrontation. Some know that they have no idea how to confront others without making people dislike them to some degree. The differences are rather interesting, for example the submissive ones typically project (it's hard to explain, it's part of the reason why I try to figure people out) less than most people while the ones that can't handle confrontation project more but that's to be expected since they're so easily scared.

I understand the whole venting thing, I'm used to be vented to. I don't particularly like it and I usually offer suggestions of how to fix things, the most common is to ignore the person with some sort of reasoning (I know when to give a real solution and when to give a pep talky one, the latter works really well when it's just a sit there and listen to me vent because it both helps solve the problem and shows that you were listening), and they both go over well and usually work because I tailor them to the individual. Then again I usually walk right into it, I may pick my friends based on them not projecting much but sometimes being around them is messing with me more than it should (it usually manifest with a specific headache in addition to everything else) and I know they have a problem that needs dealing with, I ask them if something is wrong, they say yes, I ask if they want to talk about it, they vent, catharsis is had, I don't need to fight my own brain as much and probably won't even approach my limit. Getting pushed past my limit isn't fun, there's a reason why I avoid parties.

Also that wasn't a novel, I wrote something two hours ago that takes up about as much space with fewer line breaks and that wasn't too far out of the norm for me (reading and responding)."

It's still not very well understood but right now it's classified under mental health. A mental health issue so strong and complex it's the only one still treated with surgery. I had to be diagnosed by a psychologist, I get treated by the NHS. It causes this thing called dysphoria, which is like a crushing disconnect with your body that causes extremely serious depression until it's ""fixed"". And that's different from person to person of course, not everyone feels or experiences this the same, but... That's what it is. A trans charity in the UK did a survey and it found that 1 in 3 trans youth have attempted suicide at least once. And this is a group that it's still socially acceptable to make fun of and dehumanise. If I recall correctly trans women are the most murdered of any group for who they are in terms of ratios, black trans women even more so. 

There's also a huge amount of erasure as well. When people talk about the stonewall riots do they mention it was transgender women who started it? No, they say drag queens, but those ""drag queens"" lived as women 24/7, but that's not very convenient for the ""gay"" movement. 

It's understandable that you would dismiss us and want to forget this, because we are a very uncomfortable truth. Most people will never come into contact with us, and if they do they can just dismiss us. ""Oh, tranny is offensive? Fuck off is it, lighten up, jesus you're making it such a big deal."" Yeah. Those suicide statistics mean nothing do they? You totally don't mean it in a callous and dehumanizing way, you're ""just having a laugh"" at the expense of all the people who are murdered or take their own lives because of bigotry. 

It's kind of like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube though, you can't put this back in. you'll start seeing all the transphobic stuff that's absolutely everywhere. I personally wish I could stop thinking about it as well. I'd love it not to hurt every time someone you think is ok makes a ""AND IT HAD A DICK"" joke, i'd like to brush off people who say I'll never be a man, or ask me why I'd ever expect any gay identifying man date a guy with a cunt. I'd like it if I was ok with being a girl. But I can't and I'm not. 

I've heard a few times that being trans now is like what it was like being gay in the 70s. Can you imagine anyone casually saying ""oh, yeah, back when I was a woman/man"" in conversation and it not being a massive deal? 

It's ok by the way man. I did the same kind of stuff too before I realised what I was. I would never judge someone for trying to understand something better. You can ask questions if you want. I hope this didn't hit you too hard. "

He spent the last few years getting a handle on it with counseling and medical treatment, though, and now he's on daily medication that mostly keeps things under control. I'm aware of his anxiety (he mentioned it off-handedly one day before we even started dating) but it hasn't impacted the relationship so far.

If his issues were severe or required any input from me, I would've liked to have known about that somewhere in the early dating phase - after we'd known each other for a while, but before things got terribly serious. Probably right in that phase where you're hanging out constantly but haven't defined things yet. Once you start having more open and revealing conversations with each other, let that be one of them."

Emnems,KitchenConfidential,1388911537.0,"I have a moderately severe allergy to tree nuts (cross contamination wouldn't affect me but direct contamination will make my mouth and throat bleed while eating them makes my throat swell) and I've never had an issue eating out... I don't order things with nuts on them. Most places don't handle a large amounts of tree nuts often which makes the potential of cross contamination not super concerning to me. 

It's kind of a toss up whether to say something if you aren't ordering something containing a nut. Many times people think you are just saying you have an allergy but in reality you just don't like them... I can't count the number of times I've had people go through a whole list of things asking me if I like this or that, just trying to get me to admit to eating something with nuts. I even have to check face wash and shampoo to make sure they aren't in there!

I simply don't eat walnuts/pecans/hazelnuts and my family does not eat them because of me, I don't even think about them while eating out when I order a pizza or a burger. 

The other thing to take into consideration, is that every time you expose yourself to a tree nut, the allergy can and will worsen. According to my doc, it is not possible to become immune. So perhaps this person didn't realize the extent their allergy had become. I used to be able to eat a handful of walnuts and only have minor discomfort, now one bite of a chocolate walnut cookie makes it difficult to breathe and gives me papercut like sores in my mouth and throat... 

All that being said, if I were to have a reaction because of cross contamination and I hadn't stated my allergy, I wouldn't blame the kitchen staff. Most people don't realize how hectic it can be in a kitchen and have an ""utpoia"" (not the right work but I can't figure out the spelling for the other one and I'm tired) idea of nothing touching anything else until it's in the pan.

Just breathe, you will get through it. Take it as a lesson, learn from it, and move on."

Jess_than_three,AskReddit,1388911561.0,"If you want to know my fuller perspective on the subject, [here you go...](http://jessthanthree.site11.com/genderbread.html) 

I think that a ""spectrum"" with a ""straight"" region at one end and a ""gay"" region at the other is an adequate and useful model for discussions like this one, but you're right in that it oversimplifies somewhat, leaving out asexuality, failing to distinguish between romantic and sexual orientation, and ignoring the whole aspect of intensity of orientation *generally*. But for this conversation, I think it gets the relevant point across: that orientation is *neither* ""a choice"" *nor* as black-and-white as we like to pretend it is. 

On the subject of pansexuality - well. It's nice inasmuch as it explicitly includes non-binary folks; but bisexuality is **not** simply ""attraction to men and attraction to women and that's all""; although I've talked to other bi folks who do indeed have that preference, it's been a vast minority. Rather, bisexuality is in general a poor name for what's ultimately just *non*-monosexuality: people mean it as ""I'm not attracted only to men or only to women"", ""I'm not just gay and I'm not just straight"" - but because most people aren't even aware of the *existence* of people outside the gender binary, that's how it's parsed. 

Which is a really long-winded way to say that most people who identify as bi *aren't* attracted only exclusively to people within the gender binary, and shouldn't be pressured to adopt a different label; instead, the right answer is to combat misinformation and misunderstandings regarding what bisexuality is (and to reject prescriptivist arguments regarding what it ""should"" be or mean on the basis of its components). Personally, I think either term adequately describes my orientation, and tend toward bi because that's the one that people know what it means. (I use the pan flag on subreddits like /r/ainbow, though, because it's prettier. :))

People can accept one person ok as their friend, but still hold beliefs that completely contradict that. Like racist people who have black friends. 

People often think that if you just talk to somebody long enough rationally they'll understand your point of view, but it's not true. Things will eventually come around for trans people, but it will take a big shift in society first. "

1) The first instinct when you're startled is to contract *all* your limbs, causing you to potentially jerk the steering wheel and swerve into another lane of traffic.

2) You don't have a whole ton of time to process your situation in the 0.2 seconds it takes to startle. An inexperienced driver who has to actually think about it and doesn't have solid muscle memory yet could just as easily accidentally slam on the *gas* pedal.

3) Blindly slamming on your brakes in bad road conditions will probably cause you to lose control of the car.

4) Most drivers don't leave enough space in front of them. They can stop in time if you just brake unexpectedly at a normal/moderate pressure, but if you actually ""slam"" on your brakes as hard as possible, you will probably get rear-ended."

Other than that, I think the ones that get mentioned as kind of second tier from the recent times (usually because their story is actually weaker) are Kingdoms of Amalur, the Fable games, and (mostly by me) Das Schwarze Auge: Drakensang (which is pretty similar in structure and gameplay to DAO, though it came out first, just a bit less of everything). Also Jade Empire (by Bioware, Asian setting).

Another option would be to play the other games from the Baldur's Gate era, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, Temple of Elemental Evil and Arcanum (steampunk setting). 

There is also the recently releases Shadowrun Returns, cyberpunk setting but turn based combat. Even if the main game doesn't satisfy you, maybe there's something more choice based in the various user created content things that you can install easily via steamworks. "

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1388914456.0,"&gt;**A month ago, I noticed the spot where I usually park the car had a stain on it. I took it to a mechanic who told me that the car was slowly leaking transmission fluid. Turns out the transmission is so old and worn out it would be too expensive to fix. He also estimated that it would be too expensive to buy a new one. It was no big deal as the car would still last me one or two years**.

Do NOT go back to this mechanic. You should never keep driving with a transmission leak, this was bad advice.

&gt;**I don't know what to do. My PT Cruiser is my baby and I need it for my job**.


If it was your baby, you should have treated it like your baby and fixed the damn leak.

&gt;**Should I go to a mechanic and see if I can get it fixed or just try and save up for another car? Right now I could only afford less than $5000**

Do NOT go back to that mechanic. Go to a transmission shop. In fact don't drive it to a transmission shop, get it towed there. As soon as you can when shops are open start calling around to reputable transmission shops. Not general mechanics, transmission shops. General mechanics generally know fuckall about transmissions. 

If you ran the transmission low on fluid and probably ripped the pan or otherwise damaged the transmission when you ht that pot hole, it wasn't good. That buzzing, whining sound you were hearing which was likely transmission bearing failure or the front pump and means you're going to need another transmission. It's not going to cost $5000 to fix, unless that's a typo and you meant $500. Because if you have $5000 to spend, i'd be looking at perhaps putting that towards another car. A transmission rebuild is going to cost between $1500 and $2000. If you can't afford that, I don't know what to tell you, but based on the information you gave, the transmission is done."

If you have a P0420 you may have a bad cat, O2 sensor, or something else.

http://www.obd-codes.com/p0420

&gt;Symptoms The main symptom to the driver is the illumination of the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp). You will likely not notice any drivability problems, although there may be symptoms. For example, if the substance inside the catalytic converter is broken or failed, it may be restricting the exhaust which will result in a feeling of reduced power output from the vehicle.

&gt;A code P0420 may mean that one or more of the following has happened: 

-Leaded fuel was used where unleaded was called for

-A damaged or failed oxygen sensor (HO2S) Downstream oxygen sensor (HO2S) wiring damaged or connected improperly 

-The engine coolant temperature sensor is not working properly Damaged or leaking exhaust manifold / catalytic converter / muffler / exhaust pipe Retarded spark timing 

-The oxygen sensors in front and behind the converter are reporting too similar of readings 

-Leaking fuel injector or high fuel pressure 

-Cylinder misfire 

-Oil contamination

Chicken_Wing,WritingPrompts,1388914832.0,"The air wafted with cigarette smoke and mummers from the crowd in an basement comedy club. People clapped for a young kid who attempted to make the drunks giggle as they ordered another shooter of whiskey, usually Bulleit whiskey. The announcer approached the mic as the kid left.

""Good job, kid. Good job. Hope to see you next week. And now, for the millionth consecutive week Jonny has come to tell you all of his *amazing* misadventures in life. Love him or hate him, grab another drink to forget his set. Here's Jonny! He makes me say that.""

Groans from the crowd could already be heard. Jonny, an man in his mid-fifties wearing a yellow plaid suit, ill-fitting baby blue shirt covering his plump belly, a glass of warm water-downed scotch clutched in his hand along with a cheap cigar, stumbled on the stage and started yelling, ""shut-it! It's my fucking turn!"" The crowd simmered. He grabbed the microphone with his free hand, swayed slightly before starting his set:

""So, the other night, I was running hot on the craps table until I lost it all and this dude next to me says 'I can get you the money you need to win it back.' I says, 'yeah? I ain't blowing you if that's what you're looking for.' Actually, he looked a lot like that bitch in the back...""

Jonny pointed to a darker part of the club with his drink and cigar. The crack of the gunfire rings through the club but most don't take note because of their obvious disinterest in Jonny. Blood begins to mark his shirt by his belly button and the shooter quietly leaves.

""Holy shit! He shot me! He did it! Hey buddy, aim lower my balls are down here! Someone blast 911 before it gets in my drink."" The crowd giggled.

""No, seriously, this is a hole different set."" It rendered a few more laughs.

""I heard alcohol makes people bleed faster and I have both going on."" Whispers through the crowd drew attention to Jonny.

""Look, people, I've been shot. I'll set fire to this place if it means you call the police."" Audible laughs started coming.

""Fuck! Make a phone call, send a text, shoot an email, I don't care, I'm almost dead."" Jonny swayed a bit more. ""I can't... I can't stand...""

The crowd exploded in laughter, some patrons were crying. Jonny fell flat on his back much to the pleasure of the crowd and even the bartenders. The announcer approached the microphone in a hurry, stepping over Jonny's body.

""Wow! That's some dedication and production quality, Jonny! I..."" the announcer takes a moment to reclaim his breath, ""I can't believe you're still down there. Anyway, that was Jonny. The show must go on...""

Later, after the police questioned everyone for what they saw and heard regarding the hit, everyone agreed that it was the best live set they'd ever seen."

thenYES,books,1388915127.0,"Yes, I absolutely do. I've read way too many books with interesting subject matter and a good summary blurb that turn out to be completely shit. Reviews tend to help filter out the worst of the bunch.

When picking a book to read, I usually check Goodreads and rarely read anything with a rating lower than 3.75. I'll also read the most popular good review (4-5 stars) and the most popular bad review (1-3 stars), and from those I decide whether the book sounds like something I'd like or not.

If I'm in a book store, I check the review blurbs on the book--if there are good reviews from established reviewers (national newspapers, Kirkus, etc.) I'm more likely to buy it. If the good review blurbs are only from other writers, I almost always put the book down. It's pretty rare that I'll read a book without first reading at least a few reviews (either on Goodreads or from critics)."
Hazlzz,funny,1388915149.0,"It looks the same at first, but a few games in and you'll start seeing changes - yes, even to the map. Risk Legacy is fantastic. It's meant to be played as a campaign, though, so you need 3-4 dedicated friends to play it with fairly regularly. The campaign is 15 games long, after which the game is sort of over - but what you end up with is a heavily modified board and ruleset that you can then just use for individual games.

The rules are also different from regular Risk, making for shorter (2-3 hours) games, more strategy and more fun. Instead of just splitting up the world so you all have a random set of territories, you'll get one starting position each, and you pick them yourselves. Your starting territory is also your capital, and you win the game by controling 4 capitals total.

You also play as different nations with different special abilities. Also, if you're interested in buying it, I recommend you be very careful of reading more in-depth descriptions of it - I very much would describe some of the stuff that happens throughout the campaign to be serious spoilers!"

What i did was realize that if a few things worked for me. I can go at least twice so get off once in foreplay and then round two i get it going. then i would last my normal about of time 

So i blame it on being with new partners masterbatory habits and being to excited.

Well, it sucks that you feel that way but my goal is not to misconstrue anything. I do like cutting out bullshit and calling a spade a spade. It's not an attempt to misconstrue, it's an attempt to clarify. 

&gt; I never said anything about living in a fantasy land, and frankly you sound incredibly cynical and condescending.

You're right, I called it fantasy land, not you. I never claimed you said that and I made no attempt to imply you did. 

I am not a cynical person by nature but I do  come off as condescending once in a while (general tone issue) when I feel especially confident about a particular topic, like this one. Tone can be such a bitch; even more so when you don't actually have much invested in the conversation. Thanks for the constructive criticism. :)

&gt; All I meant was that two people are committed, so things about them are for each other. Emotionally, physically. They have things that only they experience that are ours.

I have no idea what that means and I don't feel comfortable responding until I do. Could you rephrase?

&gt; I mean, I'm talking about a serious relationship, not a fling.

At no point has this conversation been about anything but relationships. Flings are an entirely different subject and have yet to come up.

I don't ask this to be insulting, but is English not your first/primary language? Some of your sentences have the feel of bad translation.

Take this info with you, let them lead, if your uncomfortable let them know, if you want to take things further also let them know and for the most part just enjoy. Have fun!

Who would you say if you had to pick one who would u rather? what are the pros and cons of each. If i know those i can give you an option on what i think but the choice is yours."

Penultimatum,gmu,1388917279.0,"Keep in mind that this does not apply to the subdomains. My first instinct was to perform a test for PatriotWeb. You can see the results [here](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=patriotweb.gmu.edu). For those who can't access the site, it got graded an F due to having absolutely no SSL protocol support.

I'm not surprised that the primary domain of gmu.edu is largely up to date. It got redone about a year ago (or something like that) and its got fairly decent web design. It seems that they're trying to do this for some of subdomains that are likely to be viewed by the general public as well (e.g. [housing](http://housing.gmu.edu)). However, it seems that a lot of subdomains such as those for services (e.g. [dining](http://dining.gmu.edu)), colleges (e.g. [cs](http://cs.gmu.edu), [honors](http://honorscollege.gmu.edu)), and [PatriotWeb](http://patriotweb.gmu.edu) are designed differently. Admittedly, dining redirects to sodexo, but that just makes it potentially less secure and certainly less consistent.

I'd love to see GMU have a consistent design and security protocol across all their websites. It's certainly an extremely daunting task, though. PatriotWeb seems like it would be the hardest to achieve this for, which is a shame because it's probably one of the most important."

Maldevinine,Fantasy,1388917929.0,"This is a really hard question to answer. The sub-genres are built out of setting, character and thematic tropes.

The magic level of a setting separates fantasy stories into high and low fantasy. High fantasy has magic as a major part of the story and lots of access to magic. Brandon Sanderson writes high magic and Tolkien is an example of low magic. We need to stick a new one here for the books with more systemised magic to separate them from the ones were magic is inherently unknown.

How happy/hopeful the setting is is a range, from grimdark where everybody is an arsehole and we'd be better off without the lot of them to the ones where the good guys win and everybody lives happily every after. David Gemmel is at the darker end of the spectrum, but Abercrombie is one of the worst. Most of the modern authors are darker then the stuff from the 60's and 70's.

The scale of the fantasy ranges from heroic which focuses on a single or very small number of POV characters which do awesome things but have little effect on the outside world to Epic where there are lots of POV characters and they command armies and shape the fates of nations. In between there are also party based fantasies.

Settings vary from traditional medieval english to all sort of historical settings (I got one recently that was a murder mystery in the Mayan empire.) and off into the new flintlock and gunpowder fantasy and some steampunk works. And Urban fantasy and magical realism.

Things get really weird when we start worrying about what the characters are trying to achieve. These are things like Magical University (Harry Potter), save the world, romance/sex etc.

Then you classify the story by the various genres that it crosses over. So Legend is a Low Heroic Medieval fantasy."

Okay so I have two questions now. When you say that people are allowed to modify the code from its original design does this mean that these projects are just continually being changed simultaneously while that program is being used by the public? Because that seems like a clusterfuck, and would lead to people griefing or screwing with the program just to see the world burn. Or it something like where a person designs a really smart idea, and then some how it is approved?


Also second question when you say that people are allowed to use the code themselves, is anyone allowed to monetize their version of the project? I could see that as being unfair since they probably did a tiny tiny bit of code compared to the whole project even though they put their own personal changes to it."

lamponlamp,AskReddit,1388919350.0,"My dream starts off in a house in a small neighborhood out in the woods in the middle of no where. Everything was less colorful and gray like an 80's home video. In this house there is a gathering of families I have never met before. I am not sure if the occasion was a wedding or just a birthday party. The family that owned the house had children but I only remember ""the little girl"". She must have been 6 or 7, but there was something eerie about her. I remember dreaming about her before and she had almost killed me in it. 

After dinner, all of the adults decide to go out on the town and task me, and two of my friends whose faces I don't remember, to babysit the little girl and her siblings. When it got late, we decide to put the kids to bed. After a little bit, everyone falls asleep except for her. She was just in a weird daze and we were having a hard time making her fall asleep. Surprisingly, my friends also had a very uncomfortable feeling about her and wouldn't help me put her to sleep. Next thing I know, we all decide to kill her in her sleep/daze. We decide my friends will be on the look out and I will walk in to her dark, creepy room where the only source of light was the moon light coming through her window, and stab her in the heart. So, I grab a knife from the kitchen and we all head upstairs. While she was in her half sleep daze thing in bed, I walked in and stabbed her right on the heart. I didn't even make sure if she was dead, I just quickly ran out of the house leaving the knife in her heart. I couldn't believe what I had just done and my two faceless friends were also pretty frantic about it. As we stood outside on the front lawn, basking in the moon light which was incredibly bright like an old horror movie, we looked back at the house like it was calling our names. Lo and behold, there she was standing behind her bedroom window, staring at us dead in the eye with the knife In her hand, and running her finger nails on the glass. I had never felt so creeped out in my life. Seconds later she was gone. At that moment, we all looked at each other and we knew she was coming for us. Without saying a single word, we all book it into the woods. Apparently, in this dream, everyone can run pretty fast, like cartoon movie fast. We looked like the road runner with his legs looking like a fast spinning wheel. As we were running through the woods, it quickly became apparent that the little girl can run faster than us, because she was catching up. A few minutes of this chase later, I looked up and realized that we were running out of land when we started approaching a very rocky coast. I look towards my fellow victims-to-be and yell, ""lets split up."" One of the guys turned left along the coast line while the other turned right along the coast line. I turned right as well but I was running away from the coast line in an angle towards the woods again. When I looked back, she had turned right as well and was at the heels of my friend. At that point my only concern was for my own safety and all I can think about is how long it would take her to kill him and come after me, the one who stabbed her. I ran for no longer than a few minutes when I arrived at a picnic area where a big family had finished a reunion, it seemed like, and was leaving. There were also cabs lined up on the dirt road that connects to a main road. I jumped in to the first cab I saw and yelled ""GO!!!"" As he started driving the little girl was standing in the middle of the road with a bloody knife in her hands, but my cab driver just drove around her like she wasn't even there. As we drove past her, she was staring at me with this intense anger that I actually felt it. Apparently, as fast as we are, or she is, on foot, cars automatically beat people. The cab starts pulling out of the picnic area dirt road in to the main road and right in front of us was a traffic jam caused by the family members leaving the picnic area for their reunion. It must have been a big family because some distance later the cab picked up 3 more people; two in the back with me and one in front. I didn't question why he picked up new passengers while I was in the cab,  but I kept yelling ""Go! Drive!!!"" Right as he started driving again, the little girl ran up to the side of the cab with her super speed and hit the passenger door as hard as she could with her knife. At this point I was so scared and freaked out that I am beyond myself. But the passengers, 1 girl and 2 guys, were telling the cab driver to stop the car and to let her in because it was raining. I haven't even realized it was raining until they mentioned it. There is absolutely no thought in mind, just absolute fear now. The girl passenger kept saying, ""let her in, she is so cute."" When I heard this, I quickly yell ""no, drive she isn't good!"" At this point, I have lost my inability to explain things, but could only say ""she is not good, she will Kill"" to which the passengers thought was a joke. I then reach around and lock all four doors of the cab because no one is taking me seriously. We drive another block and the cab stops because traffic stopped moving again. A few seconds later the little girl slams on the door again trying to open it. I yell, ""don't open the doors"" then suddenly I saw my side of the door getting unlocked. I quickly lock it but it was unlocked again. Then I realized she was opening the door with her knife from outside. This lock door when she unlocks it quickly became very exhausting and I knew I wasn't gonna win to which panic started settling in. I started screaming and crying because I felt so helpless and I knew I was gonna die. As I was sitting there sobbing, I felt a little scratching on my back. It was her knife sticking through a crack and she was trying to Stab me. I lose it and everything becomes a blur and I realized I was in a dream and it was my own fucking hand reaching around and scratching on my back. So I quickly literally shake myself awake and every thing dissolved into nothingness. 

tl;dr: A little demon girl chases me around with a knife after I stabbed her because she was evil. She almost gets me when I wake up

He's only 450 IP, so you can buy him without being set back too much. His Q is Consume, which basically acts as a second smite that also heals you. This not only increases clearing speed but also makes you able to sustain longer before backing. With some AP and mana regen, Consume means that you can literally never need to go back for healing, only buying. His E is Ice Blast, which throws a snowball at an enemy, slowing their movement and attack. This helps with ganking, as a slow enemy is easier to take down."

scannerJoe,AskMen,1388919984.0,"Just to add a point to the general tone here: when I was young and shy, it always took a long time for me to make a move, even if I was pretty sure that the girl was into me. Why? Because the let's say 20% chance that I was wrong was enough to make me hesitate. Friends would say ""Just try it, if it doesn't work out, you'll date other girls."" But I wasn't interested in the abstract notion of ""dating"" or ""girls"" - I wanted to be with that one girl, that *person*, spend time with her, talk, and so on. The moment you make a move, there's a risk of breaking that and that risk often felt too big to take. Eventually things would mostly fall into place, and I can say today that I do not regret a single relationship I had in my life, because every time I had gotten to know and enjoy the person before going further. Nothing to do with abstinence, just plain romanticism.

Maybe see it the other way round: there's a guy who's willing to spend time with you and not just get in your pants. And yeah, he very, very probably likes you, but on top of that respects you. That's pretty nice. If you want to speed things up, just take his hand and you'll know."

This might be out there, but I personally believe Blake Griffin is as good as he's going to get right now.  He'll always hover around 20/10 which is very good, but he doesn't really excel at anything else that's not a given for the modern PF.

In a vacuum I'd take Melo's contract/age over Griffin's and its not even close.  He's much more talented imo and he has the ability to consistently take over a game.

I was shocked and disgusted by the acts I had seen (3 or 4 guys, 1 girl) and saddened that as a girl I would be ""expected"" to do these acts once I was an adult. It pissed me right the hell off and it felt incredibly unfair to me.

In addition to this, I grew up in a very religious family so I felt overwhelming guilt for having watched it. Right after I decided I was done ""learning"" from the video I went back to my mom's house, crying, and confessed everything. She was great about it though :) Thanks mom!

simonjp,Sherlock,1388920440.0,"Sort-of; anyone in the UK with a TV pays an annual licence fee of about £130 (IIRC) per household. That's used to fund Public Service Broadcasting. The vast majority of that goes to the BBC, although a little is given to the other broadcasters with a public service remit, like ITV, Channel 4 and even Sky.

In theory the licence fee is separate from direct taxation so that the BBC is safe from Governmental tinkering."

greenl1ght,AdviceAnimals,1388920622.0,"&gt; It's much easier to leave that to the consumer

This is the kind of laisses-faire thinking that leads to incomprehensible cell phone fees.

&gt; the consumer only has to keep track of the tax rate in their region at that exact moment

Do american stores not have a local store manager?

&gt; most Americans are accustomed to being aware of their own local tax rates prior to purchase, and when traveling, simply expect to pay more or less for certain items, particularly gasoline/petrol.

_JeanGenie_,AskWomen,1388920960.0,"Yes, twice. Once I was having a drink with a group of friends. It was still early and it was only my second drink. But all of a sudden, I collapsed and fell off my barstool and couldn't walk. My friends took me outside to a nearby park. They told me I had to throw up, so I did. They called me a cab and gave me money to pay for it. I got home safely but had to ask my mom to help me undress (I was only 17). I still don't know who did it and what they tried to accomplish.

I also got xtc/mdma in my drink while I was at some awesome foamparty with my best friend and a whoooole lot of people I didn't really know. I was the only one who didn't want to take xtc with them, but I sure felt like I had. I had a great time, to be honest, so I ain't even mad. But I still don't want to do drugs. "

no_real_username,AskWomen,1388921001.0,"&gt; from an objective point of view, some people are not attractive...according to our current society's standard at least.

Sure, from an objective point of view, *according to subjective standards*. Not everyone buys into society's standards. Some people find different things attractive. Being attractive or unattractive is inherently subjective, and there is no ""objective point of view"". That isn't to say that ""no one is unattractive"" necessarily, but simply that such broad generalized statements make no sense. No one is unattractive to *everyone*. And no one is attractive to *everyone* either.

&gt; you're realistic that you dont have the physical qualities that count in that regard.

No, it is also saying that ""I assume that the physical qualities that I don't have are the ones everyone finds attractive"", which is not true.

If you want to talk about b.s. then start with the dumb assumption that ""what I find attractive must be what *everyone* finds attractive""."

TheToastofBotswana,AskUK,1388921033.0,"I would spend a few days in Edinburgh. It's a great city for tourist attractions (Edinburgh Castle being the favourite) but it's also a nice small city where everything is in walking distance. It's the kind of city you can just wander round; have a poke around the backstreets of the old town, hang out in pubs, take a ghost tour in the vaults under the Royal Mile.
Edinburgh also has a varied nightlife scene and has some good shops hidden amongst the many tourist tat shops.

If you want scenery the highlands are about an hour and a half away by train so you could probably do that in a day trip."
keypuncher,conservatives,1388921039.0,"One of the requirements for passing the California Bar, is a lawyer must submit an [""Application for Determination of Moral Character""](http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/4/documents/MJP/61SFweb.pdf) to the state Bar.

One of the things on that application is a section that lays out the duties of an attorney.

The very first thing on that page (page 12) is the following:

&gt; It is the duty of an attorney to do all of the following:

&gt; (a) To support the Constitution and laws of the United States and of this state.

The last thing on that page is the Attorney's Oath: 

&gt; Attorney’s Oath
&gt; 
&gt; I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, and
that I will faithfully discharge the duties of an attorney and counselor at law to the best of my knowledge and ability.

Given that Sergio Garcia deliberately violated Federal law to enter the country illegally, and continues to violate Federal law by remaining in the country illegally, that should have disqualified him from the Bar, due to a moral character violation.

The court's ruling in this case was that violating Federal law only matters if it is a law they agree with."
