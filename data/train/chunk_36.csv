Hung_Like_Hussein,AskReddit,1390451679.0,"Not bad. But that fails in comparison to the senior prank that we planned.

Let me preface this by saying, we just wanted to have a dance party. However, getting a dance party, in a small conservative Midwestern school? Not gonna happen bro. So we came up with a plan.

First, we stole one of the Fire/Tornado escape route signs. This provided the infiltration group (7 senior boys) with an accurate, reliable map of the school and grounds. After copying it onto smaller sheets of paper (it was 2 feet by 3 feet, not exactly discreet), we had a group of 10 guys carry maps with them, marking the locations of security cameras, entrances, and classrooms with markers/smartboards. As the information filters in, we begin to plot out the plan of action for Operation: Dance. 

Here's how it went down:

The members of the 'infiltration' group all ordered plain black Morphsuits (spandex bodysuits covering the entire body). We also purchased slip on black shoes from Walmart, the bottoms of which we covered with Duct Tape (harder to find tracks if we step in liquid). We acquire a disco ball from one of the senior girls. One of the boys 'acquires' the keys to the school's 'cherry picker', which we use one day after school to hang the disco ball in the cafeteria, from the stage lights (There were no cameras in the cafeteria) returning the keys afterwards. We purchased a large number of gallon ziplock baggies. We 'acquired' a master key to the building.

Now here's where things go wrong. The original plan was to remove the plates from one guy's minivan, get into the Morphsuits and shoes at a house off campus, and enter through the kitchens at 2 am. We would then go throughout the building, 'stealing' all of the dry-erase/smartboard markers and writing ""Seniors"" on the board. We would hide the bags in the ceilings of each class room, so that people would think that it was the main prank. 'Oh, the teachers can't use their boards, how clever!'. After stealing the markers, the students would exit the same way they came in, so that only one door would actually be used. The infiltration team would drive to the local bayou, remove the morphsuits and shoes, put them all in a plastic 55 gallon drum, add rocks, seal it, and drop it off of the bridge into the deepest part of said bayou. The next day at lunchtime, after the 'senior prank' hysteria has died down, the dance party was to begin. The theatre students with experience were to access the lights/sound for the cafeteria (extremely easy the way the building is set up), blacking out the room except for the disco ball, and blaring 'Sexy and I Know It' (sorry). Boom. Dance Party.

Problem is, we had a snitch. He gave no names, but once the cover for the dance party was blown, our access to the light booth was cut, making months of work fruitless. 

tl;dr Seniors wanted a dance party, break a few laws, get snitched on, no dance party :("

Races of interest would be fletchling, drow and tiefling. (lets not create a drow noble commoner, that would be silly)

I'll go with tiefling.

Get [Fiendish heritage](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/fiendish-heritage) as your level one feat. Assume a 100 on the list for 2 abilities. 48 for invisibility against non intelligent undead. Damage reduction like 18,33,54,68,91. Or Spell resistance like 41. Maybe even 70 (pick your alignment for detect alignments from others) if you play an evilish char that is scared of paladins and stuff.

I'll go with invisible to undead and DR 2/cold iron. 
Spell resistance might be better but you'll probably die to any magic user anyway.

Perhaps.  But I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the percentage of slovenly, unkempt, obese men are quite a bit smaller in the gay community than they are in the hetero community.  

Please realize that as a straight man, I'm quite envious of the gay men that are about to keep themselves looking very well groomed.  I'm simply incapable of this and no one I know is able to do this.  I'm not even kidding.

&gt;There's plenty of straight men that keep clean, just as there are gay men that are total slobs.

In my 46 years, I've only met one gay man that was a slob and he admitted it, that his partner did the house keeping and he was totally comfortable with this.  No other gay man has ever exhibited my level of slovenliness....ever.  I know plenty of straight men that exceed my levels tho.

As one of my friends always says, ""stereotypes save time"" :)

Sure we might not like them but stereotypes exist because there are A LOT of support for them.

&gt;Also, wouldn't your point be clearer if you said you were a gay guy instead of a straight guy?

No because that would be dishonest.  I'm not gay.

To be honest, I might be bi but I don't think so.  I honestly don't fantasize about men, they don't fill my thoughts and I certainly don't jack off to homosexual male porn.  However, I do fantasize about women, I lust for them and sometimes find it difficult to maintain my ""professionalism"" around them, I also find myself doing things to simply attract hot women and when I masturbate, I only get off on hetero porn or F on F porn.  

I don't have anything against gay people and there are times I find certain mens features quite amazing.

I just find that hetero is more appealing to me.  Perhaps as I grow older I'll find a man that I can both be attracted to and can enjoy exploring the homosexual side of my personality....but I'm not sure this will ever happen."

It was my freshmen year of highschool and It was with the girl i had had a crush on since like 5ith grade. She was a thicker girl but had amazing tits. like im talking DDD as a 14yrold. We had a science class together that yr so one day i got the stones to hit on her. She was dating someone at the time so i had no idea if she would bite and then she did....

I was so stocked. She told me to come over to her house after school at 3:30 (she lived down the street) and so i was there and she let me in. We went to her basement and she turned on some music and sat on the bed. I remember the song that came on the radio just then. It was 50cents Candy Shop which was super funny when you think about it but i really did not make the connection til i had left.

Well we went at it for 15 mins or so. it was amazing. SHe let me grope her and everything. One thing that struck me odd though was that she never took her shirt off. i wanted to see those amazing tits but i never did which was a bummer but she must have been having fun  because she asked if i wanted to her to give me a BJ. I was so freaked and this was a lot to process as a young teen who has never done anything like this before. Before it went down though her mom called and told her she was coming home and would be there in 5mins. I was like DAMNIT! I had to leave but damn did i have some fun. I did not go home but went across the street from her house to my best friends and played basket ball with him haha. 

While we was playing she came out and watered the plants but while she was watering them she bent over in a sexual manner and then looked back at me winked and then went back inside. Was a good day."

Chap82,brisbane,1390452435.0,"Best way to get over someone, is to get shag someone else.

It's a very yes and no situation as the principle of this is that you shag someone and realize that the ex isn't the only person that's good in bed and so helps you take Him/Her off the pedestal and ultimately helps you come to the conclusion that they are not the be all and end all of your romantic life.



Pro tips:

Never do this with someone you like, respect or have admired from afar because it's just a shag to help you wake up form your melancholy state of your break up and would be a toxic foundation for a new relationship.

Never with someone that sexually inexperienced (I know this is hard to gauge but do try your best) because it will have the opposite affect and make you yearn for your ex more.

Never mix this saying with sexual experimentation. The ex and yourself had brilliant sex because you two had months/years to know what each other likes in bed. A bad experimentation might help keep your ex on that pedestal.

Let the other person know it's just sex for sex sake. Your heart is probably hurt/broken form your ex so lets try not to break others.

Let it be something you want to do not just to spite your ex.

Don't over think it, it's just sex anyway and last of all have fun because it's a big beautiful world out there :D"

I hate beer, I can cook, I dress with style, I enjoy theater, I can dance like a champ (only salsa and tango, everything else is... Meh), I like to sing, and I love art. 

Some times guys think I'm gay, I don't give a fuck. I'm flattered that they find me attractive.  Then I just inform them that they are outta luck. 

Truth is, manliness is not definable, is it? 

A man is whatever he wishes to be.  He is comfortable in his own skin and embraces his quirks, because they make him unique.

choreosophical,MakeupAddiction,1390453292.0,"former professional dancer here. what style are you performing? there are different conventions for ballet, modern, jazz, etc. also, if you're not performing solo, you should ensure your makeup looks cohesive with the rest of the ensemble. if you want to pop on stage among an ensemble, it should be because of the quality of your performance - not because your makeup is visually distracting attention from other performers!

good stage makeup usually looks like a drag face up close. my recommendations are to:  

* use matte powder liberally: stage lights are hot and will make you sweat and get shiny  

* go heavy on the contour (especially on the cheekbones and forehead), and don't forget to shadow your jawbone  

* you can go for a darker brown color in your crease, if you have one.  

* line your waterline with white or skin-toned pencil if you have it (makes your eyes look larger)  

* do winged black liquid eyeliner on outer 2/3 of both the top and bottom, and white on the inner corner  

* false eyelashes! not too long, natural-looking ones. saves you time trying to get your mascara right.  

* highlight your brow bone in a white shimmery color  

* use a matte lipstick instead of gloss (gloss catches the light where you don't want it to)  


in my experience, colors don't read well on stage, because you never know how the piece will be lit, and it might totally distort the color palette. better to go with neutrals, but make the darks darker and lights lighter than usual. glitter can be hit or miss; i find it unnecessary.

Hung_Like_Hussein,AskReddit,1390453509.0,"Here's mine (repost from the crime thread): 

The plan was for a senior prank. 

Let me preface this by saying, we just wanted to have a dance party. However, getting a dance party, in a small conservative Midwestern school? Not gonna happen bro. So we came up with a plan.
First, we stole one of the Fire/Tornado escape route signs. This provided the infiltration group (7 senior boys) with an accurate, reliable map of the school and grounds. After copying it onto smaller sheets of paper (it was 2 feet by 3 feet, not exactly discreet), we had a group of 10 guys carry maps with them, marking the locations of security cameras, entrances, and classrooms with markers/smartboards. As the information filters in, we begin to plot out the plan of action for Operation: Dance.

Here's how it went down:
The members of the 'infiltration' group all ordered plain black Morphsuits (spandex bodysuits covering the entire body). We also purchased slip on black shoes from Walmart, the bottoms of which we covered with Duct Tape (harder to find tracks if we step in liquid). We acquire a disco ball from one of the senior girls. One of the boys 'acquires' the keys to the school's 'cherry picker', which we use one day after school to hang the disco ball in the cafeteria, from the stage lights (There were no cameras in the cafeteria) returning the keys afterwards. We purchased a large number of gallon ziplock baggies. We 'acquired' a master key to the building.

Now here's where things go wrong. The original plan was to remove the plates from one guy's minivan, get into the Morphsuits and shoes at a house off campus, and enter through the kitchens at 2 am. We would then go throughout the building, 'stealing' all of the dry-erase/smartboard markers and writing ""Seniors"" on the board. We would hide the bags in the ceilings of each class room, so that people would think that it was the main prank. 'Oh, the teachers can't use their boards, how clever!'. After stealing the markers, the students would exit the same way they came in, so that only one door would actually be used. The infiltration team would drive to the local bayou, remove the morphsuits and shoes, put them all in a plastic 55 gallon drum, add rocks, seal it, and drop it off of the bridge into the deepest part of said bayou. The next day at lunchtime, after the 'senior prank' hysteria has died down, the dance party was to begin. The theatre students with experience were to access the lights/sound for the cafeteria (extremely easy the way the building is set up), blacking out the room except for the disco ball, and blaring 'Sexy and I Know It' (sorry). Boom. Dance Party.

Problem is, we had a snitch. He gave no names, but once the cover for the dance party was blown, our access to the light booth was cut, making months of work fruitless.

tl;dr Seniors wanted a dance party, break a few laws, get snitched on, no dance party :("

92MsNeverGoHungry,Military,1390454718.0,"I did [one a few years ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cpxth/iaman_army_mortuary_affairs_specialist_currently/)

I've got a few that have stuck with me, and I would consider impactful in different ways.  The Army is such a small community it's not uncommon that you run into people that are one person removed from people you know (""You're from Fort Lee? Do you know SPC Fuckknuckle? I went to Basic with that guy!"").  As such, I've run into a few people whose buddies I sent home.  When I reclassed I had the little brother of one of the guys I sent home in my class; that one stuck with me.  

Decompression Was pretty standard Army stuff.  I got into running in a big way in Afghaniland.  I was on Bagram, so we had plenty of space to do it.  I started the deployment not being a fan of it, but not particularly hating it.  I was never into hitting the gym, so I was basically doing the same MWF running TTh muscle failure workouts from the unit back home.  Then I saw all these free 5k's where you would get a shirt.  So I did some of those.  Then the 10k's.  I did the AF half marathon there, and did the Disney marathon a month after I returned.
That kind of leads to an answer for your last question.

So sometime in August I signed up for Disney.  It's expensive, but I'm making deployment money and not spending any really, so who cares?  My dad did it 10 years before, and I figure it'll be fun.  I'll get back in mid november, and then Jan 7 I'll run further than I've ever run before.

I get back and go on block leave and drink and go to Hockey games and don't really train like I should be in the weeks leading up to Race day.  I go back to work and do the standard company PT, but 111th QM Co is one of the most POG units in the Army (I say this with love) and 4 miles in 40 minutes is a common run.  Basically, I'm setting myself up for failure.

But, eventually, race day is here and I'm enjoying the hell out of it.  There are marching bands on the race route and character actors every half mile or so.  I get my picture taken with Belle around mile 4 and a couple of gravediggers around mile 14.

Around mile 20 I hit the wall and I slow down.  I'm sucking quite a bit, and can tell I've slowed, but I'm not too worried about it.  I'm looking at the people around me and just enjoying the feeling.  

As we're pulling up to Epcot, and the last mile and a half or so, I see an older couple next to me.  They're maybe in their late fifties, and they're both wearing custom t-shirts that say 'This run's for [Name Redacted].' and then have a picture of a handsome dude and a birthdate/deathdate at the bottom.  I do a double take and realize that I recognized the face.  I had sent him home.

I ran over and told them I was sorry for their loss, but thought it was admirable that they were running for him.  They saw my haircut and asked if I was in the service, and I admitted I was and volunteered that I had just gotten back a month or so before.  They asked what unit I was with and I told them I had deployed with the 82nd.  We were silent for a few moments, and the dad asked if I had known his son, which was obviously a dificult question.  I told him, ""not well, sir"" and he smiled and said something to the effect of ""Obviously.  Otherwise you'd know he wouldn't want a leg like me to finish so close behind a goddamned paratrooper.  Go finish the race, airborne.""  I told him ""Airborne, sir"" and took off.  

I didn't reveal how I knew their son, or what I did, but even still it stuck with me.  With that job it's not often that you have any contact with the family members of the Fallen.  You may get the opportunity to perform Funeral Detail every once in a while and see what you work does for the family, but it's largely an invisible job.  People are incredibly grateful that you and yours exist, but they don't like thinking of it and that's okay.  The job is to provide solace to those that are left behind by treating their loved ones with the dignity, reverence, and respect they deserve."

ThatCrankyGuy,windowsphone,1390454806.0,"I am extremely frustrated that the largest *software* developer in the world is being so thick and slow with *software* development.

It is true that iOS and Android had time to implement features over several years and versions. However Microsoft is fighting an uphill battle and what they don't have is time to beat around the bush perfecting their software. They needed to get Wp8 right from the get-go.

User customizability is virtually inexistent; you can either change all tiles hue or change the background image of the lock screen.

Lock screen's only way of protection is pin number.. you want to lock using a password? Sorry, that doesn't exist.

Nokia launched the App Folders app, but it is half assed, not because Nokia didn't try, but because wp8 is restrictive enough that a proper solution cannot be made. This sort of feature should already be inside the OS and should work naturally and be more integrated. Tiles should update, and the container tile should open up (like the iOS group), or popup, and allow you to select from there -- not launch a whole new app -- jesus, how lame is this.

Do not Disturb mode? Nope doesn't exist. Want to set a background? Nope, you can have black or white as your color of choice, but that's all we allow.

Twitter is absolutely unusable because of that sorry excuse for a notification ""thing"" called Toast. One liners that truncates and flash across the top of the screen and vanishes.

Toast is also extremely inappropriate in that it doesn't allow you to be more discrete with your notification. Want to know you got an sms and not display the message content? Nope sorry can't do that. Gotta display that sexy time message the wife sends while the cellphone is lying on the desk and the boss is casually sitting on my desk talking to me and looks down on the screen as ""I want to fuck, come home early!"" flashes across the screen. What the fuck, MS?

This promised Notification better live up to the expectation or I'll have lots of stern things to fill my letter with and mail it to MS.

Let's not even talk about the permission model -- yikes. For MS whose' based so much on the iOS model, they went and got inspired by the wrong permission mode, Android's. iOS has it right is that NO ONE reads or understands what the ""permissions section"" in the app store says. The system should prompt the user when the application requests access for the first time to things like contacts, pics/videos, gps, Bluetooth, etc. Having that tiny size 9pt font section describe what the app does (which no one reads, and when paranoid folks like me do read, I tend to wonder why something trivial needs access to everything on the phone -- it would be so much better if I could selectively allow/deny individual requests when asked for the first time, and then go in the setting to re-tweak them should I change my mind).

And let's not even go into the ""Settings"" organization... it is chaos. Nothing is ordered or organized based on any metric. It's just.. a mess.

So many developers are complaining that they can't do things because the platform is locked down and extremely restrictive, it isn't playing towards MS' advantage.

k, I'm done."

namkash,science,1390455194.0,"From mechanic thermodynamic: the entrophy is a state of dissipating energy, it always changes and it will never return to the earlier condition, what it is called irreversible. Thermic, kinnectic, static, etc., the condition of matter has always energy. You can burn wood, which generates fire, that heats the air, and then stabilices with environment air; at the end the environment air absorbed the energy, as it's logic, air will not burn back the wood. Entrophy always looks for energy balance, dissipating it, what we call the Thermodynamic laws.

There are some phenomena where matter absorbs energy (pressure, dynamic, heat, etc.). To dissipate that energy, the matter passes it to other matter, replicating its first condition. Just like water waves, or a nuclear chain reaction. That's the key: dissipation.

Because of the entrophy and energy balance, atoms and molecules try to balance their internal energy, which they absorbed by sun light and temperature environment heat (life conditions). To dissipate that energy the atoms must pass it to other atoms, which will pass it to other atoms, and so on... At the end you will have a system which absorves energy and pass it to others (it will always happen, is the universal condition). That may be the born of the first living organism.

Let's change your example of the people in a room: they are in a square room and have the task to recieve boxes and get rid of them, by putting them in the other room across one of the 4 doors, one in each side of the room. They will do this task, but the easiest way to get rid of the boxes is to give them to the nearest person, logic for lazy people. They will find out that if they add more people they can make a ""chain"" to pass the boxes to one door, making a more complex system. Later they will get more people to pass more boxes to the other doors, even more complex system. Of course they will have to arrange themselves to make this task efficient. In this example, the people are the atoms, while the boxes are energy.

Hope to be clear, english is not my first language and I'm not expert but I understand the idea, just from physics view."

lmhoward726,TwoXChromosomes,1390455342.0,"You may want to further research the statistics of transmission for this - I'm not sure how accurate the rates are that are listed [here, in the article you linked in your edit above](http://herpesopportunity.com/downloads/herpes-opportunity-disclosure-handout.pdf). They state, seriously, that the chance of dying in a car accident is 1.81% EVERY TIME you drive. This is so patently absurd that I doubt the rest of the pamphlet. The source they're siting was stating that 1.81% of all deaths that occurred in the United States in the entire year were from motor vehicle accidents... entirely different from saying every time you get in a car there's a 1.81% chance of dying. The streets would literally be a bloodbath if this were the case.

One thing that the pamphet should have made clear is the time period over which those transmissions are taking place. From what I've read, I believe the rates they are listing along the left side of the pamphlet in the pie charts are transmission rates over the span of ""a year of regular sex."" Of course, the amount of ""regular sex"" isn't defined, it could easily be the amount of sex had by one couple in a month and the same that another couple has over several years. It would be more helpful/informative to know the chance per act of intercourse, or even if the rate of ""regular sex in a year"" were properly defined.

Statistics are a weird thing about which I feel most ""pamphlet writers"" are ill-informed, so it may just be best to read individual studies yourself and draw your own conclusions. "

92MsNeverGoHungry,Military,1390455412.0,"Some of the paperwork is different, but the process of repatriating whole Human Remains vs Portions is pretty similar.  Both get the same DD forms (890, 1076, 2064) filled out, but it is against policy for us to 'associate' portions.  That is, we cannot say on a form that this foot belongs to PVT Soandso.  We don't have the ability to perform DNA tests in theater, so all portions are shipped as 'disassociated portions' with a sequence number that resets on 1JAN every year.  They are packed in the same Human Remains Pouches (HRPs = Body Bags) and covered with 40lbs of water ice the same as full human remains.  Portions are not to receive a draped flag.  This is how regulations read.

That said.  There are several instances I know of where due to IED or fire several remains were commingled to the point where we could not adequately say which bits belonged to whom.  By regulation this is not an issue, you simply put the portions in a casket and ship them home to be positively identified.  But before they fly home, these remains will be part of a ramp ceremony attended by their comrades.  These guys know there were four guys killed in that truck, and if we only send one flag draped casket it will raise questions.  Questions probably should not be answered by telling those left behind any gruesome details.

In those cases we would do our best to establish what belonged to whom and ensure that we had the requisite number of caskets draped.  The paperwork would say 'portions' as it was supposed to, but if four guys died you could be damned sure that four flag draped caskets were on that plane.  While that may have been against regulation, we never heard a complaint from Dover.  They understood."

So for example, a subsidiary company makes  you a box of cookies which they sell to a retailer for 3 dollars who sells it to you for 5.  Now to drop the price 2 dollars they'd have to get 1 dollar.  That looks really bad on the  balance sheet  of the corporate sub entity.  But marketing and advertising can be under a different branch of the company, so marketing pays 2 dollars per bag of cookies to the retailer, and they increased sales 300%!  While the sub entity is still looking like it drew in  X number  of dollars per bag.  

Basically just different levels of strategy at work, and different arms of the company.  "

cluberti,homelab,1390456746.0,"If your network is 10GbE and configured properly at all points using decent equipment, you can indeed get the same sorts of speeds over iSCSI as you do with an SSD (10GbE == ~1280MB/s, theoretical maximum).  Most current-get desktop and laptop SSDs max out between 500MB and 600MB per second of sequential data transfer, so even with the TCP overhead, a well-designed setup using 10GbE can be plenty fast.  This does, of course, require 10GbE NICs, switches, etc.  However, if you want storage network speeds that match or beat fiber channel, you have to use 10GbE or faster.  1GbE does not have the capability of keeping up with what a local SSD can do, but 10GbE does.

As others have said, using PCIe SSDs (like the PCIe 3.0 ones you'd find from FusionIO, for example) can net absolutely ridiculous performance compared to SATA / SAS SSDs, due to the bandwidth capable over the PCIe bus (PCIe 3.0 using x16 slots can do just north of 950MB/s - I've seen multiples of these in a RAID 0, and..... yeah).  It'd take 4x SDR infiniband to be able to provide those kinds of numbers, and of course a disk subsystem at the other end that can push that sort of data as well.  Expensive :)

To that end, VDI systems that I design and/or implement use multi-node clusters, all nodes with 10Gb iSCSI connectivity (with MPIO) to the storage array or arrays, and these arrays have tiering of SSDs and 10 or 15K spinners to provide good performance at a reasonable price/performance point compared to the normal design of using FC for servers accessing storage (as VDI hosts provide much different and more random I/O loads than most server workloads).

As /u/creamersrealm points out, there are use cases where SSDs that are non-local make perfect sense, but for a laptop or desktop single-user machine, using things locally makes good sense.  If you're looking to test/play/experiment/etc., then go for it."

WormTickle,Military,1390457003.0,"Hey, so long as the families aren't looking at a shoddy wrinkled uniform that looked like it had been slept in the night before, you're doing better than the people my dad had.

I think not being pleased to be voluntold you've got to go to a funeral with little notice isn't horrible of you. It sucks any time a job springs ANY random work on you with no warning and no concern that, having thought you had that time off, you had other plans.

I'm sure you treated the solemn occasion with the gravity needed WHILE you were there, which is really what the families need to see. You can resent your command all you like and get numb to the deaths all you need, but to take it out on a deceased service member isn't cool, and that's what it looked like my Dad's HG were doing.

I'm sure that honest mistakes would be forgiven by the families. I know that I wouldn't have noticed them marching out of time or whatever, but the obviously janky uniforms were glaring in comparison to my husband, who ended up actually being the one to hand the flag to my mother."

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390457049.0,"One thing to add to other people.

Currencies in many cases didn't 'start the same' and drift apart.  They just never represented the same amount of value.  

For the *vast* majority of purchases people make a  100% difference in the denomination of a currency wouldn't matter.  Whether a car is 10 000 franks or 5000 dollars doesn't matter (if 1  dollar = 2 franks).  The only time you run into problems is that something worth only 0.01 frank you either have to sell in lots of 2  for 0.01 dollars, or you over pay by 100% for items worth 0.01 (1 cent).  Whether you get paid 50 000 dollars a year or 100 000 franks or SertGdoodles wouldn't matter, you'd have the same buying power.

And then as other people talked about, currencies shift in value over time to reflect government banking policies, the creditworthiness of debts in that currency (which is tied into say the value of assets of that currency) the desirability of goods from that  place etc.  

The Gold standard (or silver or the like) meant currencies were convertible in a defined way, but it wasn't 1 pound = 1 frank = 1 Dollar = 1 Mark = 1 unit of gold.  It was that x pounds = y franks = z dollars = w marks = 1 unit of gold where 'w, x, y and z' where all defined by their own  countries banks and well, people disagreed on what the exchange rates to gold should be and deliberately changed it over time.

We could fix cPanel issues ourselves ~95% of the time, and I would say the average turnaround time for a seriously huge issue (that we could fix ourselves) was 6 hours.  For actual in-depth cPanel bugs it was usually within 48 hours through some kind of patch.

I would say we could fix Plesk issues ourselves maybe 60% of the time, and if a ticket needed to be opened for **any** reason, you were looking at a turnaround time of 72 hours *minimum.*  Actual large issues were usually to the tune of 1 week so that it would bypass support and end up in the real 'support' aka the developers.  The developers themselves were awesome, but it sucked that to get to them you had to slog through a week of useless ticket responses.

Also for whatever stupid, stupid reason....  Plesk customers sure as hell loved Windows VPS's with just barely enough resources to even run 2008 R2, let alone a full-on web panel and IIS virtual hosting server.  This didn't help anything, but we had the same level of issues regardless of hardware.

I will say the absolute worst thing about cPanel is it's plugins; particularly anything from.... http://www.zamfoo.com/tiki-index.php these freaking guys.  Nginxcp is probably the best plugin cPanel has."

Calcium was an unrelated issue for me, but there are clear correlations between calcium issues and Vitamin D. Calcium can deposit in joints several times a day. When these joints are used, especially in a strenuous or repeated way, the calcium is broken up by the movement. Those little pops, clicks, scratches, etc. could be the calcium breaking up as the joints are used. This is generally harmless unless there is a connected health issue. 

It's good to consider something unusual a symptom until visiting the doctor for a full checkup. Better safe than sorry with stuff like this. Good luck to you."

If you haven't played a Crystal Remake yet I *highly* recommend this one.

That aside, it isn't exactly entirely complete. You can play through the entire Johto storyline but it ends after the Elite Four. However, diegoisawesome is planning on finishing it so if you don't want to invest your time in an incomplete ROM hack you'll be just fine as long as you're patient."

In Gen III all the maps were in 2D which made it easier to edit considering that any person could go and make a map editor (like me with MEH), but with the NDS generation they moved on to 3D maps which need 3D modeling software.

However, we do know how the scripting engine works (to an extent) and we can edit just about everything else besides the maps, pretty much making the current state similar to what Gen III hacking was in around 2004-2005ish, where hacks were just badly reordered maps of RSE with a slightly different storyline (looking at you Ruby Destiny).

Renner1,syriancivilwar,1390457551.0,"One of the reasons I do take issue with any allegation of Syrian complicity in Jihadist/AQ cross-border movement during the Iraq war is simply because how much the Assad  government clearly hates the ideology-- and on the other side of the scales, how much the takfiris/salafi jihadis hate the Assad government and the Alawis as a whole, as part of their poisonous worldview.

It takes quite a suspension of disbelief to assume that Assad would actively allow these sorts of people-- we're talking worst of the worst in terms of the extreme jihadi sense-- to come into the country, and take them at their word that they wouldn't case trouble or outright start attacking the authorities and people in general while they were there.

You also have to assume that Assad just really hates America *that* much, on a geopolitical basis-- something that doesn't seem apparent, unless it evaporated somehow after the Americans declared an end to their combat forces being in Iraq.

I don't think Assad is super intelligent, but if anything, he's extremely cynical about how America will react in terms of the American military and the American government. That doesn't suggest some hatred that would lead to ""I'll help Al Qaeda get at America, and let them lay low in Syria""."

ISIS people are not rational, are not pragmatic, by any extent. If their leaders are actually, they have to pretend not to be when they're going all publicly takfiri."

AwesomeLandia,Teachers,1390457899.0,"I have that problem too, from time to time.  Some kids need direct intervention in behavior.  Sometimes it's moving seats (put the noisy kid next to the quiet kid-- sorry quiet kids!), sometimes it's calling out the kids individually.  I give kids a little notice on how I much time until they need to be quiet, and I vary it depending on how noisy they are at the start.  ""I need quiet voices, facing forward, in 3, 2, 1...""  I try to use a quiet and calm voice (getting quieter and calmer as I count down) to encourage the quiet setting.  My partner teacher uses peer pressure-- the class stays in during break if there is noise (even if it is just one person).  

The truth about classroom management (from what I have learned so far) is there is no real, true answer.  It depends on your personality, the class(es) you have, and the make up of the students in that class.  All of that can even vary from day to day.  That's why more experienced teachers do better-- they have the knowledge of many different strategies and the experience of knowing when to use each one.  "

FuckESPN,RotMG,1390458063.0,"You're getting answers from people who haven't decompiled the client and poked around for any serious amount of time (no serious ""hacker"" uses Yogda to decompile the client, lmao). And who are also completely neglecting all of the server-side code none of us can see (which we know Kabam has improved upon since the introduction of anti-Paralyze hacks among other things - mostly exploit related).

One thing we know they did, which was a **huge** undertaking, is localization. It was originally supposed to allow them to implement other languages, but if nothing else it has removed all basic strings from the client (ie, plain text crap). This is why you now see things like ""Connecting to NexusPortal.Medusa"" (etc etc) and hundreds of other more-hidden strings. Many of which were used as bookmarks for hacked clients (which is why many of the popular ones, FSv3, reconnect, and all of the /command related hacks) have been broken and not publicly updated. +1 for Kabam here as an unintended side effect. Almost the entirety of how client-server communicated together was redone (and optimized) in this regard.

There were also numerous optimizations to how the client connects to the servers. This may sound hilarious, given how much lag a lot of users experience, but it was definitely done. They also seem to have implemented a fantastic way to change packets every patch, which is a major headache for many of the java proxies developed and released during the WS (and early Kabam) days.

HW acceleration, while buggy, is another big feature that optimizes the game further for certain users - is mostly client sided - and never existed during the WS days.

Thats just a handful of things that are plainly obvious. Which means there is probably **much** more that isn't. Maybe Nullbot will drop in and comment on some other things, although I know a lot of the ""optimization"" was done by the original team (hence the lack of actual content released for so long). Going to leave out actual features (ie, spam filter, dungeons, etc) since those don't directly related to optimization/code cleaning.

Ultimately, Kabam got handed a **lot** of shit. There was a fascinating post on ""that forum"" months and months ago about some of the XML limitations WS ended up cornering themselves with - which got handed down to Kabam. Wish I could find it 'cause it would give another good perspective on just how poorly some things in the game were designed. But most, if not all, were done that way because of the limitations a small team had at the time. I mean, this game got popular out of nothing. It was just a small forum contest entry and a couple of guys learning on the fly. Nonetheless, to say Kabam has done nothing in this area shows a lack of knowledge and understanding on the subject and history of the game."

midgaze,stopdrinking,1390458137.0,"I went to an outpatient rehab, 3 hours per day 3 times per week. There were people in our group that had ""graduated"" from inpatient. They liked to laugh about this and that about their stay, this one salad that they kept serving in particular, but I got the sense that it was a positive experience for them.

If you need medical attention to detox properly, inpatient is definitely the best option. It's also the option that will get you through the toughest period to not drink, because you pretty much don't have the option. If you need it you need it, and if you have been failing to stop without it you might need it.

Think of it as going to camp for a while. Sure we're all a little older but when you put people in a situation they tend to cope pretty well. I'll bet you would have a fine time with it.

I'll add that rehab was pretty key for me. It was a process that resulted in some honest changes in my perception of my self, and in my understanding of alcoholism and my relationship with alcohol. It's very nice to be around other people who have problems in a more or less structured environment. You get to see that you have a lot in common with a lot of people there."

Also, if you feel like you cannot look someone in the eye, look at the  space between their eyebrows. Depending on your height and proximity to them, they will think you are looking at their eyes (kinda).  It will help inch you towards normal eye contact.

PlushieChomby,relationships,1390458346.0,"So people are downvoting you (and likely about to downvote me) because the common sentiment on this sub is that if you know about cheating or even possible cheating, you should always report it to the proper party regardless of outcome or personal consequence. For the most part, I agree in theory, but in practice I'm the Bad Luck Brian of pointing out cheating. Here are a few gems fron my past: 

* Years back, an older (late twenties) friend of mine came to me and asked me to sniff around his girlfriend of 3 years to suss out whether or not she was cheating on him, because he felt like she was. Stupidly, I agreed, and after finding incontrovertible proof (pics of her french kissing and groping another guy), I showed it to him and reported back what I'd found, only to have him deny the truth (she had a rare hair color combination and style - it was obviously her, he just didn't want to believe it). He angrily confronted her about it, she lied and said I really had it out for her (out of the *blue*! We'd always been friendly, I mean wtf...) so much so that apparently I must've found her doppelganger, gotten her to agree to cut and dye her hair the exact same wild colors and had her agree to pose for sexy pictures with a guy who looked strikingly like her running buddy. When I tried to point out how insanely ludicrous that accusation was and how I literally had no motive, reminding him *he* came to *me* in the first place, my words fell on deaf ears. Our friendship was ruined, and even when he walked in on her fucking some other guy in their bed almost two years later, I heard about it through friends because he still didn't want to talk to me. So whatthefuckever, some people just don't want to hear it. 

* Saw a friend's girlfriend holding hands, being playful, kissing another guy at a movie theatre, told him, she denied it, bam our friendship is over because she says I'm a liar and he thinks I'm a meddling asshole. 

* Ran into a friend's husband at a client's house with total sex hair. After his surprise, he left and my client told me he was his favorite lover, showed me pictures, they'd been ""together"" for almost four years - he'd been married to my friend for six. He wouldn't stop calling and texting me, finally I texted him back saying, ""You have a week to tell her or I'll tell her myself."" He texted back, ""Tell her what?"" Fucking asshole. So the week's up, I take her out shopping and to eat and tell her over lunch about everything. She simply cannot, and I mean *cannot* believe her husband is having a gay love affair, calls me disgusting for even suggesting it. In my stupidity, I offer to let her meet my client and find out for herself (their vacations matched up with his ""out of town business meetings"") but she flat out refused and our friendship was over like that. He texted me one last thing: ""Told you."" Sending me into a fit of alternating rage and tears for days. 

* Went to a lunch with newish friends, acquaintance brings her new boyfriend - her new boyfriend is my good friend's boyfriend of two plus years, he behaves uncomfortably and leaves the restaurant before the meal is over. She gushes about how wonderful and attentive he is, I absorb details, call friend that evening and she sounds cautious but agrees to meet up. I take her to grab caramel macchiatos and tell her what I saw, she smirks and calls me an asshole. Tells me her boyfriend already told her ""What *really* happened"" that day, that he'd run into me at lunch, I'd confessed to being in love with him and only staying friends with her to be close to him (LOLWAT?!?) and that he thought I might try to ""stir up shit"" between them. I couldn't fucking believe my ears. He must have been a hell of a salesman to pitch *that* speech, or however he delivered his misinformation. She left in a huff, I never found out if she eventually discovered he was a cheater or not. 

These are just four examples of how horribly wrong it's gone in my own life, and during many of them I was suffering from depression and serious life issues. The negative results from trying to do the right thing contributed to my depression and ability to cope. So just know, regardless of what you read, or what anyone here says, that you know your life. You know your friend. You know all the little nuances that a bunch of internet strangers can't suss out from just a post and some replies. Whatever you decide to do, tell him or not, it's not wrong. You do indeed need to take care of yourself. While even with my track record of things going hideously wrong I would likely drop a, ""Hey man is everything okay with your girlfriend? Okay cool, I just wondered because I saw her being touchy feely with her personal trainer at the gym and thought you guys might be on a break. I don't want to be involved, I mean, I don't know anything more than I saw, and I definitely don't want to be involved because I'm dealing with a lot of personal stuff right now, but I thought if I was you I might like to know."" That doesn't mean it's necessarily the right choice for you in this situation. 

Whatever you decide, be confident in your decision and stick with it. Try to think out what the best way to leave yourself unscathed would be, because personal care is incredibly important when you're going through seriously hard personal issues. "

Renner1,syriancivilwar,1390458551.0,"&gt; When I fought for Al-Qaeda, we sent weapons and fighters from Der ez-Sour into Iraq. Assad left the roads and border open. In Jordan, in Kuwait, in Turkey, not even a dog could wander into Iraq, but from Der ez-Sour we went where we wanted. Our job was easy. No one asked about our activities.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Later on the former fighter they interview talks about finding out his immediate boss was on the take from Syrian security forces.

Sure, I suppose it is possible. There's absolutely no evidence of these people trying to mess with the political situation in Syria or attacking anyone in Syria, so you would assume that if the guy's telling the truth here that some kind of deal had been worked out.

What's still getting me is that Assad knows how nasty these guys are at the time of the Iraq war. He knows that they're overtly anti-Shia and anti-anyone who isn't them, and that they're going to make life miserable for everyone in the country, not just the Americans-- the people who actually spent the most time fighting the Americans being pro-Ba'athist Iraqi nationalists.

I know I'm sort of repeating myself, but you see where I'm not seeing how it really comes together?

&gt; but it is to say they used a lot of the same people as a foreign policy tool in the past.

•
I'm very likeable, there's a 99% chance that your whole family is gonna love me.

•
I'm quite attractive. 

•
I get off with my partner's pleasure, so i'll make sure sex is good for her, or it's not good for me.

•
I'm a good listener.

Cons:

•
I can be very lazy. If you want to constantly go out and do shit, you will eventually find me to be a drag.

•
If I get carried away with something, I might forget to consider your feelings as much as I should. I just get wrapped up in something and become oblivious.

•
I sleep very badly. I toss and turn a lot and snore.

•Until I become a pro athlete with an amazing body, I have some body issues. (Shouldn't be long)

Reddit_SuckLeperCock,cringepics,1390458788.0,"There was an AMA a couple of years ago from a factory worker making moisturisers and face creams and shit like that. The way he described it was like this - there were giant vats squirting out whatever product was being made, for a few days they'd have Oil of Olay containers and when their order was filled, switch them to no-name brands. Same shit, except one came with a $50 price tag, and the other was $3.99 at Target or wherever. This happens *everywhere* in manufacturing from food, to car parts to home wares and industrial machinery and everything in between.

The only difference between the price tags is successful brand building through advertising. So really at the end of the day, people like the women in OP's post are just retarded and doing themselves a disservice by paying top dollar for goods you can get for far less. "

Informed consent clinics are the best. They allow you to take control of your own health care instead of having to depend on some gatekeeper.

Any doctor can prescribe hormones if they don't mind doing a little research. A specialist in endocrinology is overkill in my opinion and should only be consulted in cases of adverse reactions. It's just a matter finding a doctor that isn't an ass, which can be difficult but isn't impossible. Just remember that it is your body and you have a right to seek care elsewhere if a doctor is being obstructive or rude.

I know that being assertive is extremely difficult for me. It is one of the biggest things I hate about transition. It forces me to have to assert myself constantly or risk being thrown under the bus by medical professionals and anyone else I am forcibly outed to, including my own family. You have to be ready to assert yourself too. (which totally sucks because it's more fun to be the ""nice girl"")

Fluttershyhoof,transgender,1390459186.0,"Could it be that the context makes them nonsensical because the word itself is nonsensical? Gender is a verb and a noun. To gender or having gender. When someone or something is assigned gender, they are gendered. 

Transgender is an adjective. Transgendered seems to fit the bill for a past tense verb. You can't ignore the roots in that way. Trans gender. To go beyond the normal black and white of gender. Trans gendered. To go beyond... having had gender assigned? I mean, yes, that can make sense sorta. Though it does seem that this implies only an agender individual. A transgender individual can be going against their assigned gender or crossing (trans) the gender line. But they aren't actively crossing or going beyond having gender assigned. Well... in the case of genderfluid, agender, bigender, and genderqueer people, yes... kinda. But in a typical MtF or FtM case, no. 

I can see the point you're making, but I feel like that word requires very limited or contrived situations to feel appropriate. Even then it's clumsy and the sentence would be better served using just transgender. Still, this has been an awesome discussion. "

92MsNeverGoHungry,Military,1390459256.0,"I thought I had typed up another one a while ago, but I can't seem to find the comment so maybe it was elsewhere.  This is actually one that's stuck with me more vividly.

In addition to sending home fallen US/Coalition servicemembers, one of our responsibilities was to return local nationals who died in American care to their families.  Often these were Afghan National Army soldiers or Afghan National Police officers who had been serving in other provinces and been killed.  They'd be flown to Bagram and their families notified.  We would prepare them and take them to the front gate and turn their remains over to their families.

Sometimes, though, they were just local nationals who happened to be sick or injured and died in an American hospital.  They would be swathed in a kafan at the hospital and turned over to us.  We would bring an HRP with us and muslim orderlies would work the remains into the bag.  We would load them on the stretcher and take them back to the morgue where we would put them in a simple pine box.  ANA/ANP would have an Afghan flag draped over the lid. 

Some time later we would receive a call from our LNO who would let us know when to meet the family at the front gate.  We would remove the casket from our refrigeration unit and load them in the back of our big white box truck.  We would put on our plate carriers (SOF guys took care of us; we had cooler kit than we had any business having) grab our rifles and head to the gate.  At the gate we would meet up with an interpreter and the family would come through the walking section.

They would confirm the names on the paperwork and we would pull out of the gate.  They would pull up their car and we would transfer the casket from the box truck and come back inside.  It became pretty routine.

One day a 15 or 16 year old kid was hit by a truck.  I don't know if it was an MRAP or what the circumstance were, just that he was hit and died at Craig Hospital on Bagram.  We received a call that the family was on the way and that we could meet them in an hour.  We load up and head that way.

At the gate, things went a little different.  Instead of a local 'terp, we were greeted by an Airman.  We asked if he knew what we were doing and he said handing over someone to their family.  Accurate enough.  Let's go.

He walked over to the walking entrance and talked to the guard, who brought the family over.  The three of them walked up and we had the Airman ask their name and what kind of car they had with them(It's not an unreasonable question; you'd be amazed at the vehicles we've had to strap coffins onto).

They told us that they didn't bring a car.  We asked how they planned to get their son home.

They told us they would take turns carrying him.  These were not big burly SF bros.  We asked what they meant by that.

They looked confused for a second, and then one threw his arm around the other and kicked his right leg back.  Like you would help someone who had a sprained ankle.  This made sense to the Airman.  Me and the other two MA guys exchanged glances.

I told the Airman to ask them what they had been told about their son.  They said that he had been hit by a truck and that his leg had been broken.  I took a deep breath.

I had the Airman confirm the name of the boy they were supposed to be picking up.  The names matched.

""Alright, man.  This is about to be a terrible day for everyone involved.  We're Mortuary Affairs, and we have a dead kid in the back of our truck.  I don't know who's fucked up, but right now we need to confirm that this is the right kid in the back of our truck and the only way for us to do that is for me to climb back there with him, open the casket, and have him make a visual ID of his son.  Best case scenario: PAD screwed up and we're going to scare the shit out of this guy telling him his son is dead and he's not.  Worst case scenario: We have to tell this guy his son is dead and he doesn't react well.""

So the ghost-white Airman and I bring the father over behind the truck while the uncles stand out front.  I slowly and calmly explain the situation with the Airman repeating me in pastho.  The father argues for a moment, and starts to get fairly animated.  He walks back around the front of the truck and talks to his brothers and they get fairly upset as well.  My hand moves to the grip of my rifle, as I start to get a little more alert.

So the father comes back around to the back and crosses his arms.  He is convinced that it is not his son.  It cannot be his son.

As the ramp lowers, I move next to him.  The pine box comes into view and his face hardens.

We climb into the truck, and I point to the rollers on the ground telling him to be careful.  The Airman stands on the ground outside.  He didn't sign up for this.

I half crouch next to the casket as the man kneels.  He's between me and the exit.

I wrestle the top off the casket and slide it toward the wall, my hand still on my rifle.

I reach over and unzip the HRP as far as I can reach, almost to the waist.  I fold the flap over and the body is there wrapped in white muslin.  The father's breathing is coming rapidly and through his nose.  He's visibly shaking.

My understanding is that it is disrespectful for a non muslim to touch the burial shroud.  I gesture to it, ""Would you...?""  He shakes his head, vehement.

I reach over and pull the shroud back, exposing the boy's face.  The boy's name falls from his father's lips, just barely audible.  He looks at me.  I don't speak Pashto.  I don't know what to say.  ""I'm Sorry"" is all I can muster. 

I don't know what he saw in me at that moment.  I still don't have words for what I saw in him.

He lunged at me then.  Fast and hard.  His arms wrapped around my neck.  I'm still ashamed that it took me a few moments for me to take my hand off my rifle so I could hug him back.  It's been better than three years, and it still bugs the shit out of me."

There’s a fraction of a fraction of people who can call this land their homeland, the natives being our smallest minority sad as that is.

Phone's notification behavior ties deeply into our social behavior. We want to know, and sometimes we don't want to know certain things. If your phone can detect you're in a meeting and apply the meeting dnd profile -- in which you may have set that it stays silent for all events except calls by members of your family (and even then it vibrates), and for emails from your key associates-- then the phone has become smart(er), and it is one less thing for you to do when you are so consumed by everything else happening around you.

If you get twitter notifications, and you sleep with yoru phone next to you, then it's a pretty weird problem. because you don't want to be bothered by twitter, but you also don't want to miss important calls. A smart dnd feature allows you to specify which contacts to let through in whatever profiles you schedule the dnd to take effect at certain times. So I never miss important calls while I'm sleeping, but never get annoyed by general notifications.

Qieth,loseit,1390460288.0,"I'll try a different approach from flaming you, if you don't mind ;) 

Your metabolism is always running. After you sleep, you are running on an empty stomach, so your body is burning glycogen and fat for muscle.

There is no significant difference in metabolism between eating 1 large meal a day or 10 small. 6 meals a day are popular because it makes it easier to manage hunger, but it gives you no advantage weight loss wise. 

But we are all wired differently. Some people can't not eat breakfast, and some people can follow a different eating pattern. But that's good: there is no argument against eating breakfast from a calorie standpoint. 

Though it is worth noting that breakfast is often an unhealthy meal for many people. A lot of breakfasts involve a lot of cards for fast energy, but if you really want to give your system a good start to the day, you really want to give it a good dose of protein. 

So continue to eat breakfast if that suits your lifestyle better. But it's certainly not VITAL :) "

Nope. That's not bipolar. That's an infantile misinformed view of bipolar.

Source: I'm *actually* bipolar. Mod over in our subreddit, in fact. 

The disease is characterized by periods of depression interspersed with periods of what is known as mania, often much shorter periods. Mania is characterized by rapid or racing thoughts, sometimes delusions, high energy, irritability, promiscuity, and/or overspending. The worst forms of mania can result in psychosis, hallucinations, major delusions, basically being completely out of touch with reality. 

Your Mom isn't bipolar, not by your description anyways. She sounds a lot more like my mother, who has Borderline Personality Disorder and a degree of Narcissistic Personality Disorder... Undiagnosed, because these conditions almost guarantee a person won't seek treatment, but I'm 99.9% sure that's what it is, at least with my mom.

The thing is, Narcissists... They tell you they love you, and they do stuff for you sometimes, but it all has a price. It's never a matter of ""I love you no matter what"" it's... ""I love you if you conform to my ideals of who I think you should be, because you're merely an extension of myself.""  ... And the attention seeker thing... It's also.. probably not what you think. My mom ""hates"" causing scenes and being the center of attention... But... If she's sick, everyone has to drop everything to take care of her. If I do/say/feel something, and try to talk about it, it's never about how I'm feeling, it's about how *she* feels about what I'm doing/saying/feeling.... 

So yeah. I hope I'm wrong about your Mom. And, fact is, I'm pretty sure my Mom loves me to the best of her capabilities.... She's just not really all that capable. 

But, fact is, abuse isn't love. Love isn't a part-time thing. Abuse isn't a full-time thing. That's why it's so insidious. 

But yeah, good luck with that. "

The best advice I can give is to just be there for her. Don't try to give her too much advice, just listen. You might desperately want to understand *why* she feels this way, but there likely isn't an obvious answer that can be easily fixed. She may not even feel that there is a particular reason, which in my experience is even more depressing. There's nothing quite like feeling that you should be happy while you're suffocating under the weight of depression.

It shows, to me at least, that size can still be relative depending on travel systems available.  This is the reason why out of The three most recent major titles Morrowind is still my favorite.

m4xn00b,Filmmakers,1390462906.0,"I'd like to chime in here, I was camera op/DP for this short. Self teaching myself DSLR shooting for a couple of years, more intensely this past year, so relatively new it all. If I get any details wrong, I apologize in advanced, but I'm going off what I know. I don't really have any general tips but here's what I did and my reasons when I was shooting this film.

Entire short was shot wide open at T1.5. It was really the only practical option since we were shooting with no sunlight, though the street lights did helped a bunch. 

The obvious positive side effect of this is the ridiculous amount of bokeh balls and shallow depth of field for a dreamy, drunken look. This also really helped a couple of shots when the background needed to be obscured because of a retail sign that would've ruined these shots. 

The one caveat of shooting this way is the challenge of pulling focus, since we don't have a follow-focus system (poor), especially in the December weather. Many times I would buzz the shot because my fingers were numb from the cold, even with gloves on. 

You really just have to keep retaking the shots until you nail it, even if the talent gets tired or bored of it. It's imperative that you ""have the shot"" because many times a re-shoot is just not possible and it will just be inconvenient for everyone involved. Even if you do manage a re-shoot, the second time around is just never ever the same.

That being said, our ""actors"" (friends) weren't anything like that, they were amazing and absolutely awesome the entire time out and on the pavement in the freezing cold.

As for working with another person in production, in this case the op, my good friend: Film making is inherently collaborative. Communication is key. Share anything and everything. Suggest ideas, setup for shots, block the scene together etc. It really does help you see other angles that you might have not considered before. Express any concerns, any extra details that you may have noticed. Our working relationship has been pretty damn successful thus far. Of course OP being the Director of this short, he gets final say on all decisions.

For the slow motion shots, I was concerned that 60fps would not quite be enough. I was prepared to use twixtor to maximize the effect, but it turned out great. Glad I was wrong. To have a more ""staccato"" look to the slo-mo footage, I increased the shutter speed, thereby changing the shutter angle (to what values, I don't recall) reducing the motion blur. However doing that, the shot was underexposed, so ISO was upped to 800, which really wasn't too terrible thanks to the great lens.

Though the T2i is old, it is still very capable when paired with good glass, and of course Magic Lantern ;) (focus peak is a godsend). I'm always pleasantly surprised at how great the raw footage looks when we get back from shoots.

This was definitely a ""no-budget"" shoot, though we had acquired some gear over a period of time. For the opening and closing tracking/static shots we used a Manfrotto 502HD fluid head mounted on a Konova K2 slider which was then mounted on a cheapo Velbon fluid head tripod that I had acquired from Kijiji for $40 and angled perpendicular to the talents faces, being careful not to let the camera slip. For all other shots we used a [custom built shoulder rig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSPzojTC88) and a few just hand held (in car).

Just goes to show how a bit of knowledge and ingenuity can pull of some good looking shots without a lot of money. Though money does certainly help.

Sorry I'm just rambling, nothing is really structured, just putting my thoughts down. I hope this helps you and anyone else that reads this. Just keep learning. Always learning. Learn the rules, master the rules, break the rules."

There are many Indie games created/published with Unity.  Can you use it yourself?  It depends on what you're trying to create.  The same applies for jobs, it depends on what you want to do."

Cocofang,DotA2,1390464945.0,"I don't think you should simply give in to every person that takes mid/carry/farming jungle every game.

Those people really are retarded. And they make for pretty shitty games. Luckily they are on both teams though. And I actually don't want them on support either. They already suck on the roles they play 24/7 and if you put them onto a difficult role like supp they will just suck the life outa the game.

I would arguably prefer to only play with people that play Support at least once every five games, so that they keep general skills high. That would perhaps also lead to some nice times were you actually get a secondary support.

In general though you look at peoples profiles and see a mixture of: Voker, Pudge, Storm, Prophet, Shadow Fiend. You know they are gonna suck unless their opponents suck more.

The good thing though is that you still can easily win those games.Because it is actually quite easy to abuse the fact that the opponent has those people as well AND highly likely one of those carrytards or yolo mids forced into the support role, at which they suck horribly.

&gt;I'm very skeptical of the efficacy of these types of games when compared to watching a documentary, reading a book, or listening to a lecture.

I wonder if one factor is ever that maybe in a game you can track the players decisions and from that garner what the common mistakes and misundertandings are (so you can maybe focus on those topics). =&gt; or if that is considered highly inappropriate in serious gaming circles. "

Got a decent PA with a few speakers, mics, stands, etc, for $350.

sneaky edit: I'd say go for at least 100W, maybe more just depending on how loud/powerful you need your sound to be. You can always turn your amp down some and maintain a good tone, but you can hurt your tone if you go too loud with some weaker amps, so be aware of that.

apoostasia,AskReddit,1390465811.0,"My ex used to accidentally Dutch oven me when we were sleeping. It was horrendous, like several different things had crawled up there at several different times to die. Fucking rank. 

I told him that revenge would be taken, but he would never see it coming. He laughed. 

One day, a glorious day off, I decided to enact my plan. Ate brussel sprouts, baked beans. Made the most delicious beer stew, and proceeded to eat far too much. Let that simmer for a while. 

He got home from work, and sat down beside me on the couch. I told him to relax and get comfy, I'd grab him a beer. Stand up, let rip. 

He fucking lost it. So did I. Which made me fart more. 

TL;DR -  dude accidentally Dutch ovens lady friend, lady friend gets delicious beer stew and sweet sweet revenge. "

kitsandkats,unitedkingdom,1390468345.0,"I worked for a year at Milestone House (2012), the hostel on Green Lane in Derby. The rules really are not that strict: No alcohol/drugs paraphernalia/weapons in your rooms (if you brought in cans/bottles of booze we'd label them with your name and keep them at reception), you must be out after 10am and can have your room key returned to you at 5 (though you must not return after 10pm, people often did not return at all thereby taking up a bed and not using it), 28-day maximum stay (we made every effort to find them temporary housing/another hostel place in that time), no visitors, and you must spend the night in the room. The lateness policies exist for a reason - if you're not using the space, then it needs to go to someone else.

Part of my job was helping people with benefits applications - I spent hours interviewing people, helping them with forms, phoning the DWP... I even offered CV writing help. People could volunteer to do some cleaning in the building in exchange for a £3 lunch budget, and we'd fetch it for them. We tried to help in every area of their lives, including access to GPs and dentists.

One main issue for people was the waiting/'reserve' list. We had people come in every day that we just did not have room for. We had 'winter provision' between November and March, allowing people to sleep in the reception area on freezing nights/handing out blankets, so that helps a bit. 

Also - the environment can be quite intense, and some people would rather avoid it. I regularly had to call the police/ambulance/someone to remove a loose staffie that someone had let in to the building (that one only happened once). Staff were regularly insulted, sometimes assaulted. "

evade16,canada,1390468562.0,"You are correct that it is relatively easy to get a job in Canada, however it isn't easy to get a job that will lead to success. Minimum wage jobs can and are a trap for many people who cant use it as a steppng stone that they are for more profitable jobs. Being stuck in a minimum wage job barely covers cost of living let alone allowing for proper savings for further education. While it is possible to be very frugal and scratch and save and better yourself, the issue is with Kevin's point is that it isn't as easy as waking up in the morning and doing it as people in that situation are more concerned about bills to pay, having enough money to pay for your rent or mortgage if they are lucky and food and clothing let alone spending 4k+ a year on higher education.

For construction there may not be a large job market in their area for construction and the cost of moving to Alberta may be a barrier for them, plus with the number of people graduating from trades programs and apprenticeships these days the demand for untrained labor, while still there isn't as high as it was 15 years ago and the wages have dropped matching that demand.

Also worth noting that Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister and head of the opposition, is still in prison over what various groups view as false charges brought against her by Yanukovych after his contested presidential election win."

Reddit_SuckLeperCock,MorbidReality,1390469073.0,"If we average out casualties in WWII based on the war lasting for 2175 days (1 Sep 1939 to 15 Aug 1945) we get something that approximates this;

* Russian military - 4000 lost per day (8.7 million)

* Russian overall - 12414 lost per day (27 million)

* German military - 2440 per day (5.3 million)

* German overall - 3450 per day (7.5 million)

* Chinese military - 1750 per day (3.8 million)

* Chinese overall - 9885 per day (21.5 million)

Not to belittle any conflicts' casualties, as one is too many to die in violent conflict, but the numbers of killed and wounded from previous wars are just numbing.

Secret_Wizard,AskReddit,1390471339.0,"I'm going to have to go with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on this one.

Uh... put down the pitchforks for a moment, yeah? I *loved* Skyrim when I played it. I did everything there was to do, saw every place there was to see, and had a truck-load of fun like everyone else. But when my hype died down, when I took a few steps back and looked at the game as a whole, really looked at how everything worked... I realized it was a completely broken piece of garbage that needed many, many more years of development to refine it. I was actually honestly confused how I got any enjoyment whatsoever out of the game. So... I guess I'll list off a handful of the things I don't like.

Level Scaling - Fighting the final boss at level 1 in Iron Armor is the exact same experience as Level 50 in Daedric Armor. You can get more powerful, but so does everything else, so what's the point? Perks - 60% of them either don't do what they say they do or don't work at all, 30% are absolutely worthless (lol speech and lockpicking), and the last 10% are game-breakingly over powered. Custom Equipment - Between Smithing and Enchanting, your self-made equipment is thousands times better than anything you could find in dungeons. This made exploring and going through dungeons absolutely meaningless.

The Enemies - Fucking boring. Zero variety, no imagination. Ice Wraiths and Wisp Mothers are the only standouts, everything else I've seen thousands of times before. Somehow, Draugr ended up being *worse* than Cliff Racers in Morrowind. *That's* an achievement. It doesn't help that everything is as intelligent as a sack of potatoes. The NPCs - I can count the NPCs I actually liked on one hand: Jarl Balgruuf, Paarthurnax, Arngier, Mjoll... that's it. If I hear ONE MORE LINE from *anyone* in Whiterun, I'll flip a table. Dragons - Supposed to be the greatest thing ever, ended up being nothing more than annoying flies you can kill in seconds. Two competing RPGs released around the same time, Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma, did Dragons infinitely better.

The Villain - Alduin is a joke. The most pathetic excuse for a character I've ever seen. He accomplishes nothing, he never wrongs you in any way, he runs away from you, he doesn't pose any more a challenge than other dragons, he flip-flops between goals (Enslave the mortal races? Eat the world and trigger the next Kalpa? Make up your mind!) The fact that this guy is in the same series that produced Dagoth Ur sickens me.

The Quests - What happened!? Oblivion's quests were freakin' incredible. A monstrous level of quality and variety, each and every one of them unique and well written. With Skyrim's, the vast majority merely send you off to a Draugr dungeon. The rest are fetch or delivery quests. Don't get me freakin' started on the College of Winterhold... Well, to be fair, a few of the Daedric quests were pretty dang swell. Reminiscent of Oblivion's quality, they were.

I could go on, talk about the magic, the way auto-kills work, the overworld, the continual removal of content and features in the series, the dumbing down of each playable race, but I think I've made the point I wanted to. Skyrim is horribly made, horribly designed, and I am baffled as to how I loved every single second of playing it. Thankfully, the glorious mods on the PC version can fix pretty much every single issue I have with the game. Leave it to a community of strangers to fix up and produce a better game than one Bethesda took years to make."

Obviously, to each their own and if you like it, that's great, and I want to note that I do appreciate DB's producing on he track, but if I could just remove the vocal track of that song, I would, because the vocals are in all honesty the most cringeworthy I've ever heard in an EDM song. Not the lyrics, per-se (though those aren't great, either), but the vocals are just awful."

LonleyViolist,teenagers,1390471526.0,"Try checking it out usig different browsers. I think there might be some discrepancies across the board since all browsers have different specs. For instance, my phone won't even load it due to the size. "
UlgraTheTerrible,BipolarReddit,1390471528.0,"Who the hell is Salman Rushdie? 

I'd suffered from depression as a teenager. To the point where I literally slept away everything that wasn't school, and sometimes straight through school. 

But regardless, I graduated high school just fine, would've been valedictorian had it not been for calc. I never went to calc, but I passed... barely. 

My mom was/is Borderline, some narcissistic tendencies as well. Single Mom. Emotionally and verbally abusive at times, at other times trying to be my best friend. She went a little crazy after discovering my brother being molested by an older boy. Whole 'nother story, really, this one is about me. 

I was glad to be out of the house for University, but ultimately had to move back home when Mom used all my savings to pay for my brother's hockey equipment, and never paid me back. Was living with an aunt and uncle for school, they were kinda head-fucked too... Made me get up and vacuum the whole house when I had a bad bronchial infection... And asthma. So yeah, Mom came to get me but wouldn't let me go back to school, and then made sure I couldn't afford it so I wouldn't leave her... 

But I did. Got job slinging booze, a boyfriend, but he dumped me, which I guess started it all, so I took off to Wisconsin (I'm from Sask, Canada) to meet up with an online friend, who became a boyfriend briefly, but then I had to leave the states... Only I never did get all the way back home, had some other friends pick me up at the airport, and hopped into bed with one of them... 

That ""relationship"" lasted 9 months and was... Well. A trainwreck, but only so much so because that boyfriend wasn't an intellectual equal, though he treated me okay... 

Serial monogamy again reared its ugly head, and I dumped him for his best friend (I was fucked up by that point already, but didn't really realize it at the time)... 

His best friend turns out to be the most abusive compulsive lying cheat I've ever encountered, so *of course* I fell in love with him, right? Right. Anyways, one thing leads to another, my birth control fails thanks to antibiotics (always read the fine print kiddies) and I get pregnant... 

I find out I'm pregnant, leave him, back to Mom's, all well and good, except the hormones have me pretty damn fucked up and I go back, I think the third time I went back was when I found out he cheated on me... That one landed me in the hospital with suicidal intentions, I guess. That time I checked myself in. 

They couldn't do shit for me because I was pregnant, so I got let out and had the baby. Mom became... Utterly unbearable.... So I went back to the abusive ex. I didn't really realize how *bad* it was until it was all over, because he never actually hit me... 

He went out to cheat, and I got a decent friend of mine to be a sitter and went out for one final night of drinking with another young mother friend of mine... I can't remember much beyond that point... I know I did a hit of pot, but it was just supposed to be a bit, not throw me all the way off my rocker... 

Anyways, wound up picking up my kid and going home, got my friend to go grab some formula because her father hadn't come home and he was the only one with money at the time... But she didn't remember my pin and it froze.. So I bundled up the baby and went to the bank with the stroller to get my last $20 and find some food for her... 

And I wound up crying in the bank managers office. I still don't remember a hell of a lot, but the cops came, dropped the baby off with her other grandma, and I went to the station, then to the doctor... 

Someone must've called my family at some point, because they came to pick me up and took me to the hospital... Was in for about a month the first time... This all happened in April '08, and I wasn't done with the hospital until July '08... I had my birthday in the hospital. Turned 22. 

My daughter is turning 6 soon. I'm doing pretty good these days, but still picking up the pieces. Her father is no longer in the picture, having finally dumped me when I was in the hospital by saying he couldn't put up with my crazy... I still think, ultimately, his behavior is what led to my manic break... But I don't know that I wouldn't have wound up manic at some point anyways eventually. I've pretty much come to terms with never knowing. He hasn't had a thing to do with me or his daughter since. I could say a lot more about him, and I have in other posts, but suffice to say that he's probably a sociopath, and I'm glad he's not around. 

After the release, I spent about a year processing everything and trying to take care of my kid while living with my mother. Got a job at a grocery store and stayed single for two years, then tried to go back to school for a bit (didn't work out, long story, another failed relationship)... Quit the job I was working at near where I went to school and broke up with that boyfriend (he didn't want to go with me) and came back to Mom's to help my Mom with some family related stuff, involving my brother's pretty much inevitable bipolar break... 

Found my marvelous S.O. online, we've got a LDR... Got a job working with developmentally disabled adults, until I got sick (not related to bipolar, turns out it's arthritis) and pretty much had to quit because my supervisor was behaving like a child (really, the whole place was pretty screwed up)... Right now I'm in Belgium visiting my S.O. and trying to work on my writing. 

Dunno if that's what you want, but that's what's been going on for the past little while. :p"

NotSquareGarden,nfl,1390471653.0,"There are no five minute timeouts in the NFL. TV timeouts are always two minutes long. Notice how they don't always return to the broadcast as the ref makes the call. 

Also, has the amount of television timeouts increased since 2001? I'm not sure if they have. Either way, there are 16 ""random"" TV timeouts in a game right now. Would you rather they took them when the refs looking at a replay or the they do more TD-ads-kickoff-ads? They're going to call 16 of them no matter what. Also, late 4th quarters almost never have ads since they tend to front-load them.

Not under state law, for medical use.

&gt; if you are telling the state that you are going to commit a federal crime, it makes a certain amount of sense for the state to ask for your guns.

The problem here is that Marijuana is a Schedule I drug - which requires that it be ""undisputed"" that there is no medical use.  This seems to be a political thing, as it doesn't seem to be actually undisputed.  It doesn't really make sense for the state to ask for your guns for doing something that is legal under state law.  If any government entity should be asking for them, it should be the Federal government, which can't.

&gt; Besides, I think in certain states you already have to forfeit your guns if you are taking certain very strong anit-psychotics.

It isn't an anti-psychotic.

But if I had the money I'd smoke pot almost every day and eat some PK every week, though I know enough to make sure to take breaks often. Not only does it keep my tolerance down but it keeps me from turning into an asshole. As for the meth, my ex has done a phenomenal job of taking the fun out of that so I just don't do it any more. It's just not as fun alone."

predalienmack,trance,1390473859.0,"Quick note: have you listened to the Extended Club Mix version of #musicislife? I think the album is better when listened to in that format.

I 100% agree that The New Daylight is the better album and that Dash Berlin does what he does best on that album, but depending on my mood, I often have a more enjoyable time listening to #musicislife from start to finish in one sitting, which seemed to be more similar to what the OP was asking for. 

I didn't have a real issue with any of the songs #musicislife, despite Like Spinning Plates being a little strange. To me, none of the songs felt incomplete or fully out of place unlike your impression, and Dash definitely branched out and took more creative liberties and risks (partially due to a lot more major artist collaborations) with #musicislife. What holds it back IMO in comparison to The New Daylight is that it simply didn't have as many AMAZING songs on it, but at the same time it didn't have any duds on it, either, unlike ""To Be the One"" in The New Daylight, as I mentioned earlier. 

A simpler comparison:

Great songs on The New Daylight: Till the Sky Falls Down, Man on the Run, Feel U Here, Surround Me, Never Cry Again, Janeiro, Waiting (one of the songs that still makes me tear up when I hear an artist drop it live and when I saw Dash drop it as part of his closing set for EDC: LV 2013 - I know it's way overplayed, but I still consider it a top five trance track), The New Daylight

All the other songs besides for To Be the One are really, really good on their own and as a part of the album as well, and all of them have some of the best production the trance scene has witnessed. 

Great songs on #musicislife: Better Half of Me, Disarm Yourself (it is WAY too similar to Waiting, so it counts only while accounting for the fact that it used the exact same formula as Dash Berlin's superstardom-creating song), Apollo Road (this is one of those songs that we might be putting in the ""greatest tracks of trance"" years down the road), Like Spinning Plates (listening to this song at the right moment can be mesmerizing), When You Were Around, Callisto, World Falls Apart, Surrender, Man On the Skyfire

All of the other songs are solid, as opposed to really good and don't do really well on their own...and most of the great songs from #musicislife simply don't quite reach the heights and mind blowing-ness that great track in The New Daylight did.

I hope I explained my opinionand how we agree and disagree well.

TL;DR - The New Daylight is a better album with more amazing songs than #musicislife, but that doesn't mean #musicislife is an album that should be overlooked. "

To me it seems like on average europeans are less interested in music that entertains or spreads a joyful mood than in music that has a meaning of itself and can be projected onto. Metal isn't exactly easy-going and concerns itself with the dark party or life pretty often.

On top of that the US has a large demographic that's more interested in rythm-based music (afro americans and hip-hop) and Mexico is rather religious and has a strong hispanic music scene.

Not surprised Montreal is americas metal capital, after all it's cold and harsh up there and Quebec is considered the most european part of the Americas... even if they're a bunch of damn frog-eater descendants ;)"

Our military is the best funded in the world, and is a huge deterrent for other countries. I do agree that we could cut the spending, but realize that me and my husband are the first to get hit with that kind of budget cut (being at the bottom of the food chain). 

It is unconstitutional for them to pass a law *because* there is religious motivation. If you were to tell me, as a woman, that I have to follow a belief that I don't believe in because you do, that's just a slap to my face. Don't take away my right as a human being and a woman because of your religious beliefs. THAT is why it is unconstitutional. My husband is Atheist, would you like your child to follow under a law that removes the words ""under God"" from the pledge of allegiance because of his beliefs? (Not that it isn't already weird to have a bunch of kids ages 6-12 reciting something on a daily basis that they probably don't understand the meaning of... But, I digress.)

What I was trying to say is that it's weird that most of these states who are trying to rid of abortion are a-okay with the death penalty. Like I said; it's like they're saying it's not okay to play God before we are born, but after it's cool. Then it's completely okay, because logic.

The state shouldn't be killing anybody because that is not the states job. The state is to protect us as citizens, and to fix those who are broken so they don't commit the crime again by institutionalization. And killing a citizen because they killed another citizen/person... It's a flawed system all together.  "

Basilgate,WritingPrompts,1390477510.0,"Aureus climbed the steps to the Temple of the Void. He had been climbing for days. A fog had come down from the mountains, and he could no longer see above or below. There was only the steps. Only the climb. 

He paused a moment to drink deep from the leather skin at his waist. The water was sweetest nectar, a sudden rainstorm upon an arid desert. He pulled his dead brother’s sword closer to his shoulder and continued the climb.

The amber beads about his neck clacked softly with each step he took. The shamans of his tribe had bestowed them on him after he’d stood naked in the fire, painted with pigs blood to curry the spirits’ favour. They had named him Golden Hawk. Prince of Demonslayers. And now, as the phantom mist parted and the wicked splendour of the Temple of the Void stood before him, it was time for Aureus to truly prove himself worthy.

The six-tiered pagoda was gold and black, with eaves curled as a djinni’s slippers. A dread chanting could be heard from within. Lightning constantly struck the golden finial at the top of the tower, which was made in the likeness of a snarling dragon reaching to the sky.

Aureus passed the final cracked stone step and stood before the dark temple. The air here was thin and he steadied his breath. He shrugged out of his pack and drew his great, single-edged blade, not taking a moment to rest. If he dallied, he knew that he would succumb to his fear. It was well known that many warriors before him had attempted to slay the void monks, to free the land from the plague of demons that they had wrought. All had failed.

The foul chanting filled his head as he passed the great oak pillars, and through the threshold into the main sanctuary. It was dark and hot, and the sickly stench of some foul incense made him dizzy. Thousands of candles lit the great hall, illuminating the twisted supporting columns and the wretched blasphemous effigies of nameless, hateful demons that stood all around. Under the greatest of them, the seven ancient monks sat on black cushions, their obsidian robes pooling to the ground like tar. At the centre of the hall, a great bronze bell hung. The true source of the demon plague, Aureus knew. To reach and destroy it, however, he would have to pass Yami, the guardian, who stood silently before it with his arms, like the coils of an anaconda, folded at his great chest. If the stories were true, he had been the very first demonslayer who, thousands of years ago, when the darkness first spread across the world, made the climb to this cursed place. 

“O void monks,” Aureus bellowed. “I, who am named Golden Hawk, Prince of Demonslayers, have come to wipe your corruption from the earth, and free mankind from your demon hosts.”

The chanting did not stop, and the monks did not raise their eyes. Only the guardian stirred, pacing slowly towards the challenger on slippered feet. Aureus held his holy blade aloft, whispering a prayer to the spirits of his tribe. This was what he’d trained all his life for. This was his purpose, now at last, fulfilled. Lightning from outside illuminated the hall with a white glare, and as Yami bore down upon him, Aureus noticed, just for the briefest moment, a flash of sadness in the guardian’s eyes.

Across the rocks and lifeless crags surrounding the Temple of the Void, the screams of Golden Hawk, Prince of Demonslayers, could be heard for hours, amidst the chittering laughter of some unnatural and unholy beasts, and the ceaseless chanting upon the wind."

ed8020,Fallout,1390479020.0,"Yes, it needs MANY mechanics, as well as better ballistics, that you find in any GOOD shooter. ACCEPT IT. Most of the encounters, and I do mean MOST, are handled with a gun. The quality of writing and depth of the world have absolutely NOTHING to do with that crappy Havoc physics. My best example is STALKER:SoC. 

In spite of the fact that there isn't ANY leveling of the character it is still an RPG and also happens to be a great shooter BECAUSE OF the great mechanics/physics. In so many ways it is just like fallout but gun battles are SO much better. The Fallout slug fests of emptying a magazine into a creatures skull at melee range and still not killing him is ridiculous.

I've never played CoD or GoW because that's not what I'm interested in. I want a good RPG that also happens to have decent ballistics and combat tactics. I'd also like to see people do the Funky Gerbil when they get set on fire, just like FO/FO2 and Tactics. I also wouldn't mind seeing a cover system like R6 Vegas because it's a COMMON SENSE TACTIC, but I'd settle for leaning.

Why people fight it so much just blows me away. The writing and world creation have absolutely nothing to do with combat mechanics. Just because most common shooters writing consists of, ""Here's this map. This is why you want to control it. Now go kill everybody"", doesn't mean it has to be that way. "

If you're going to declare yourself to be in an exclusive relationship, you need to be sexually compatible with the other person. Part of growing up is realizing that as long as you are safe and responsible, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having sex with as many people as you want/can. It's nobody's business but yours.

communistslutblossom,femalefashionadvice,1390479723.0,"I think stores that sell dance shoes might be your best bet. You can find dance supply stores near you by googling if you want to try things on, but [Discount Dance](http://www.discountdance.com/) has pretty much every kind of dance shoe out there for very cheap. If you go to a store near you, you'll want to try to find one that sells character shoes and ballroom shoes; some dance stores specialize mostly in ballet and won't have the selection you'd need. 

I don't know whether you want something close-toed or open, but something like [this](http://www.discountdance.com/dancewear/style_S0383L.html?pid=6408&amp;Shop=Style&amp;&amp;skey=t-strap&amp;search=true&amp;SID=546934634) or [this](http://www.discountdance.com/dancewear/style_8518.html?pid=18428&amp;Shop=Style&amp;&amp;skey=t-strap&amp;search=true&amp;SID=546934486) would be cuter than a plain Mary Jane and very easy to dance in. 

Read all of the descriptions if you decide to buy something online, depending on what style of dance they're made for, some of these shoes have a ""split"" or ""flex"" sole -- it means the part under the arch of your foot is flexible, and they do it so that ballroom and jazz dancers can point their toes, but it may feel weird or not fit what style of dance you're doing."

Furthermore, I have to assume that there's *some* oversight at PADI, and they wouldn't issue me a wreck card from someone who's not even qualified to teach the course.

I understand that the cert dives are very basic and only the beginning of being qualified for wrecks, which is why I'm trying to find a way to gradually increase my experience and and skills under the guidance and supervision of an instructor.

It makes me want to bang my head on the wall that I posted a desire to get more experience and skill in a responsible and conservative manner, and 90% of the comments are that I can't get more experience and skill until I get more experience and skill.

Yet they are not. Infants are born every day with deformed limbs, heads, internal organs and a host of other disorders that are not visually apparent. Is it not within God's power to make it so that humans give birth to babies that are not doomed to suffer and possibly die because their bodies are malformed?

Because they're so diverse, the common ground will necessarily be something incredibly popular, otherwise they probably wouldn't have heard of it; so instead of talking about neo-realist films, or German minstrel poems, or classical music, they'll talk about something they can all talk about, such as popular music and popular books and popular TV shows.

Jacksambuck,SubredditDrama,1390481604.0,"&gt;But here, from Internalized Oppression: The Study of Marginalized Groups

Don't you mean: ""Internalized Oppression: the psychology of marginalized groups""? I can't find a book with your title. 

I can't find a chapter about men. Anyway, this book is about marginalized groups according to SJ ideology. It includes men only as far as they are part of some other minority group(like blacks or gays). The fundamental dichotomy of men/women externalize/internalize sexism is preserved, Kyriarchy just adds other dichotomies.

&gt;You mentioned the word patriarchy but then got the definition entirely wrong, opting for the MRA definition of a ""vast male conspiracy"" and not a social-cultural system that benefits men but does not condemn men as being at fault.

You're making up your own MRA strawman. ""The Patriarchy"" does not need to be a caricatural male conspiracy to assign blame to men. 

Besides, I didn't even define or attack it. All I said was it has a male name. You're not attacking any of the four points I listed, tacitly confirming them. Why would I source something you don't even deny?

BonzoTheBoss,DaystromInstitute,1390482005.0,"Because a ""standard"" photon torpedo is probably hundreds of times more destructive than a thermonuclear warhead. 

The warhead in a photon torpedo is a matter/anti-matter warhead, separated by a small bulkhead which collapses on impact, enabling a M/A-M reaction. In equal quantities this means all of that matter is converted into energy, and that energy is in direct proximity to whatever you want to blow up.

I'm not sure how much of Voyager you have seen, but you may or may not remember the episode ""[VOY:Friendship One](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Friendship_One_%28episode%29)"". In it, Voyager discovers a civilization that encountered a probe from early post-warp Earth which included schematics for the building of matter/anti-matter reactors and warheads. The civilization then went on to obliterate themselves in a global war, demonstrating the true dangers of anti-matter in the hands of those who are not ready for it. Their planet was experiencing a ""nuclear winter"" and the atmosphere was filled with deadly radiation and fallout.

i.e. anti-matter warheads are just as, and more, deadly than conventional nuclear warheads, producing massive amounts of energy in the form of ionising and contaminating radiation. The reason they don't seem to have much of an impact on the show is because the majority of combat is in space. Without an atmosphere to interact with, most of the energy from a photon explosion just disappates into space (no shock waves, no air to diffuse heat, no debris to fling around etc.). Plus ships have powerful shields that deflect the destructive power away from the ship. We have seen in episodes where unshielded targets can be destroyed with a single photon torpedo! And those times when we do see them using torpedoes in an atmosphere, you have to remember that the warheads have a variable yield, meaning they can tailor the explosion so it doesn't create mass devastation, the equivalent of just a few hundred kilotonnes."
keypuncher,conservatives,1390482034.0,"&gt; It never stops being funny to me that you're a climate change denier.

It never stops being funny to me that you seem to be incapable of understanding the concept that climate change occurs independent of human intervention or that natural inputs seem to have far larger effect than anything man is doing.

&gt; The best part is that you people really don't understand the difference between weather and climate.

Citation please.

&gt; The entire premise of this bullshit blog is that oil is infinite and carbon dioxide isn't a contributor to climate change.

No.  ...though interestingly, even the IPCC has had to admit that CO2 isn't the driver of climate change they thought it was, given the most recent data.

The simple fact is, climate scientists don't understand the mechanisms yet - which makes massive, poverty-inducing changes based on their non-understanding a bad idea."

ObscenePenguin,howtonotgiveafuck,1390482121.0,"Shit dude, that's horrible. She's in the girlfriendzone, you're in the boyfriendzone. You've got to take steps to move this situation forward- otherwise it's going to ruin you both for other people. 

There's a difference between doing what's right and what's easy. You know this by now. Here's a situation in which the time has come for you to do what's right.

You need to sit this chick down in a comfortable but mutual space (ie, not her house or yours) and tell her what's going on in your head, because it sounds like it's a bit of a maelstrom in there right now. Tell her how you feel- all of it, including the stuff that you're not telling us. 

It's not that you cannot hang with this chick in the future, but you're getting some very mixed (and hideously unfair) cues from this lady- and you need to be able to draw a line under it, one way or another, and move on. She's probably not going to have much to say at this. Thats okay though, because the act of catharsis is for you, not her. Let her think that shit out for a while and meet again for the concluding conversation. 

You don't like this girl. You love her. To love is to be vulnerable, it can feel like a war in your head, the highs are euphoric, the lows are devastating- and that's if it's reciprocated.

The heartbreak you feel now, that unbearable, gut wrenching, ache in your chest- is your psyche mourning the relationship that ended when she went to school. It's so prolonged because she's allowed herself to move forward, she's now got to allow you the same courtesy- but you've got to ask her to do that, tell her the mixed cues that you're getting, how they make you feel and that if that's not what she intended then she needs to stop doing it.

Give yourself time and space. Ask her to give you time and space. Meet in social situations, meet with the rest of your friends, try to avoid spending time alone together. You can get through this, dude.

Somewhere, out there, in a place that you'd least expect- there's a girl just waiting to find you. You're her One. You're the dude to make her happiest girl on the planet. I think you should give that chick, and yourself, a chance."

eighthgear,anime,1390482321.0,"And Mashiro is dancing to the ~~OP~~ PV song, during the episode...

Anyways, this was certainly a very good episode, and a big improvement over the last one, I feel. I'm glad to see that this show will indeed have a proper overarching story, and I am glad that Doga Kobo is developing the plot at a good pace - I didn't quite expect the reveal about Kobeni's past to be made this early, but I am glad that it was. I know that Hakuya is supposed to have a low presence, and this is a Doga Kobo show, so the fact that it is focused around the girls is a bit understandable, but I was pleased that he was more relevant in this week's episode than the last, and I am looking forward to more Kobeni and Hakuya interactions in next week's episode and beyond.

Though based on its title, the next episode may primarily focus on Benio, who, in my mind, is the weakest of the main characters. Weak, in that her character so far is mostly one-note - she serves as a walking gag, essentially, and it is the same gag being made over and over again (think Inami from Working!!). Though I will say, she was much better represented in this episode than the past two - she obviously doesn't like the idea of ""losing"" her little sister, though she is way to overbearing, and she does clearly understand what Hakuya did for Kobeni in the past. Her ultra-clingly nature towards Mashiro may be a bit more complex than a case of loliconism - it could be a bit of escapism, a misguided attempt to use Mashiro as a sort-of replacement for Kobeni. Or she could just be a pervert, after all. In which case, [one can feel free to discard by ramblings.](http://faultyreviews.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/1390460341740.gif?w=533)

Overall, I've been enjoying this show a good deal so far. I like that it has a more focused plot than most similar Doga Kobo series (GJ-bu, Love Lab, YuruYuri) - this isn't just slice of life, this is shaping up to be a proper romcom. I certainly hope that it stays on that track, [because unlike Benio](http://faultyreviews.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/screen-shot-2014-01-23-at-7-38-31-am-e1390483483746.png?w=900), I do like romcoms, especially ones with proper romances.

Yeah, there was literally only a few centuries of slavery in the US.  Pretty short time period to breed a significantly stronger population, especially considering that slave owners probably weren't running an in depth breeding program.

I think about my high school.  We were probably 25% black, yet there were no black kids on the swim team and the 3 black kids on my wrestling team over the years were all kids who had tried out for basketball and didn't make the team.  If a black guy wanted to play a winter sport, it was almost always basketball first.

**Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise** -- Story of the first manned space flight in an alternate universe. Pay close attention to the ""technology"": stuff like money, eating utensils, that sort of thing.

Message me it: Fine. Nothing special. Doesn't really invite me in though. ""if you'd like to help me tear apart the screenplay of (some new movie) while sharing (favorite adult beverage)."" Says the same thing you said, but is more inviting.

Looking for:  casual sex is a huge red flag for many women. It's almost implied that men on here are looking for that, you don't really need to advertise it on your profile.

Most private thing:  perfect :)

Typical Friday night:  while probably honest, it doesn't really make me interested in you. It makes you seem like an alcoholic. Especially given the other multiple references to drinking in your profile. Perhaps you could describe it in a way that makes me want to join you? You are a writer after all, imagine your ideal third date as a scene in a movie and write your Friday night like that.

Thinking about:  what you have here would be better in your self-summary, but it's fine.

Six things:  fine. This is a good place for a hook and I can't imagine writing a message to you based off of any of those six things.

Favorites:  wall of text. Your longest section and probably the least read section on a profile. Narrow it to three examples for each category, preferably the more unique ones, everyone likes Mad Men and Breaking Bad, and possibly add an anecdote about what you like about it or how you came to like it.

Really good at:  fine

Doing with my life:  fine

Self-Summary:  ugh. This really is the hardest part to write and it the most important part to write. You are a writer for goodness sake! Show it!

Pictures:  your second is better than your first. Also, add a full body and/or action shot. More pictures. That's 80% of the selling point on here.

Questions:  I don't have an account so I can't check your questions, but based on your personality tab you haven't answered very many. It's a good idea to answer 3-5 new questions a couple of times a week because it keeps your profile on the activity page and will get you more views. 

Please take the time to participate in the critique requests of a few other users to lend a helping hand. And sometimes it can help you make improvements on your own profile as well.

Good luck."

I had great nurses and the anesthesiologist was also amazing. I got teary (silent tears of fright) and they made jokes about rather being on a beach with hot men and it made me laugh. The anesthetic burned a bit but it was only for like 2 seconds and I was out. Then I woke up and it was done (I had my IUD removed). I was so high from drugs I didn't even care after and just kinda wobbled my way to the car and went home. It doesn't take very long to do either.

BonzoTheBoss,DaystromInstitute,1390486489.0,"In terms of ship to ship combat, transporters as a weapon don't really work because of shields. We do see that episode where Voyager beams a torpedo aboard a Borg ship, but I think that's a rare occurence. Firstly because it was just a probe, not a cube or sphere. Odds are on a larger vessel transporting a single torpdeo wouldn't have been very effective, and they would adpat their sub space field to prevent any further transports after the first one was detected. Secondly we know that there are things as transport inhibiting fields, so perhaps most species have a passive field going all the time when they're not using their own transporter. It would be safer than suddenly realising your entire crew has been beamed into space.

As for transporting someone's heart out, you have to consider how a transporter works. It uses an annular confinement beam to cordon off a space prior to beaming to ensure that nothing in the immidiate area can interfere with the transporter beam mid-process. In order to transport someone's internal organs you'd need the confinement beam to penetrate their body, at which point why don't you just shoot them with a phaser?

I suppose you could disable the annular confinement beam, but I'd guess that as transporters have been developed to function as *safely* as possible, it's probably damned near impossible to disable such a vital safety feature. Even if you did, I'd argue that transport sensors wouldn't be sensitive enough to differentiate individual organs from the whole organism. You would just detact ""a lifeform"". But then in ""VOY: Scorpion, Part 1"" we see B'Elanna use a ""skeletal lock"" to beam Harry Kim back from the Borg ship, so I might be wrong on that one.

To summarise, the transporter isn't a very reliable weapon. It can be easily jammed or disabled (how many times have transporters gone offline during a critical moment?!) and for the results you're trying to achieve it's just as easy to shoot them or send some photon torpedoes flying."

Mine and my husband's rule is that we only go to things BM will be at if it is a one time only event for the kids, such as school awards, sports.  Birthday parties, holidays, etc are separate.  Even when we go to things, we go as a couple, and we don't sit with BM.  She always rushes to grab the kids right after, so we will go and say hello to the kids and then leave.

One thing mom may have to realize is this means missing some firsts, but you can start your own traditions from the time the baby is very young, and so while the dad may have him on his very first Christmas morning, you will have him on his very first day after Christmas extravaganza or whatever.  As long as all the parents love the kid, he certainly won't be lacking.

eatgeeksleeprepeat,AskReddit,1390487744.0,"My life would probably be totally different if I never found a specific website (something along the lines of Girl Land) when I was 13.

This site was a forum for young girls, somewhere you could post questions and talk to each other. Some girls created layouts for their comments/questions which were basically straight HTML tables with cute colors and gifs.

Of course I wanted one so after looking at this girl's site where you could copy the code, I decided I wanted to learn how to make one. I started playing around with HTML and got really interested in web design.

Fast forward to high school, my Mom (who has a CS degree) encouraged me to try CS as my major since I liked web design so much. If anything it would help me get into the college I wanted to go to due to the lack of female CS majors. My high school counselor told me I would never get into that school but I did end up getting accepted.

If I never found that site, I never would have gotten into web design or computer programming. I might not have gone to my college and met many of my close friends. I never would have found the career that I have and might not have found a job right out of college which has supported me well.

It's the only way I can get anything to stick when I need it to (for some reason when I read a paper from outside my field on the bus I remember the details of it months later, go figure). What also helps is consciously focusing on the parts of a flow of logic you don't understand and then doing the working yourself; this applies to organic chemistry especially, actually; I'm awful at organic because I failed to do this. I'm good at relativity because I did this a lot.

(For most of the more mathematical subjects, learning abstract algebra also makes a lot of difference to being able to take your own notes coherently, I think, but I generally tend to overestimate the usefulness of mathematics).

Also, if at all possible, don't just read the standard textbook. I generally find older textbooks more comprehensible (especially with the note-taking). Getting multiple wordings/perspectives is better than the same over and over (this seems to be especially important for quantum mechanics, but I don't see why it wouldn't apply to other fields, too). And finally, for some reason, I almost universally find the smaller format graduate textbooks more comprehensible (where available). I might need 3 of them to get all the context I need, but they give more context than the corresponding undergrad book does."

EDIT: The above is for Portuguese, for Spanish:


**Por qué** typically is used in questions, meaning ""why"":

¿Por qué celebramos el 16 de septiembre? (Why do we celebrate September 16?)
¿Por qué estamos aquí? (Why are we here?)
¿Por qué no citas tus fuentes? (Why don't you cite your sources?)
Por qué is also sometimes used in statements that form an indirect question. In such cases, it usually is still translated as ""why.""

**Por que** occurs when que as a relative pronoun follows the preposition por. If that sounds confusing, think of por que as meaning ""for which,"" although it is often translated as ""that"" or ""why.""

Esa es la razón por que he querido salir. (That is the reason for which I wanted to leave.)
El motivo por que llegué tarde fue el paro de buses. (The reason for which he arrived late was the bus stoppage.)
Por que also occurs when que follows a verb phrase using por. For example, the phrase for ""to worry about"" is preocuparse por. Here is an example where the phrase is followed by que: Se preocupa por que las soluciones sean incompatibles. (She is worried that the solutions will be incompatible.)

Worf is frequently going on about how his father shaped who he is, how your father is everything, learning about your father is learning about yourself, etc. Coupled with his conepts of honour, you'd think he'd want to be the ideal role model for Alexander.

Add to that that Worf was raised on Earth by human parents, he must at least understand a little of what Alexander was going through; a lone Klingon growing up unsure of himself or his ideals... It just seemed like so many times the writers just concocted convenient excuses just to get Alexander out of the way so Worf could carry on doing his usual stuff. You could argue that Worf *did* try and empathise with Alexander, but more oftne than not Worf just seemed... *annoyed* by his very presence. Perhaps he disliked him *because* Alexander reminded him so much of himself as a child and he wanted to distance himself from that ""time of weaknes and uncertainty""?

I mean you could argue a starship isn't an appropriate place for a single parent to raise a child, but they handled that particular dynamic pretty well with Naomi Wildman.

ruat_caelum,OkCupid,1390489309.0,"Mine is personal experience. Most (if not all) of my female friends are either childless and unwed or wed and planning on having / have children. So in my social circle I don't have friends female or male that are single parents (so bare that in mind.)

My experience is through either myself dating or close friends dating, single moms. This is not second hand from my friend it is what I observe in both cases.

I think where you mentioned your child in your profile is fine, I'm not saying she defines your personality or that your ex does or that your status as a single mother does, but these are all unmovable things.

The issues I am mentioning are the common ones, nothing you'd see on reality tv. You have to schedule everything weeks out because you are juggling three schedules, your's, your child's and your child's father's visitation etc. There is often issues as you said. Alcoholism or violence, or chewing with your mouth open or putting the toilet paper on backwards. Instead of being able to make a clean break with your ex you have to deal with them for the rest of your child's life. For most people (in my observation) this means they carry on with whatever annoyed them / ended the relationship.

I have personally had the transference thing with both single mothers I tried to date.

One was still extremely jealous and suspicious about cheating etc, another had issues with paying for things, i.e. ""I'm an independent woman I can pay for my own things!"" This was not mentioned politely etc, but clearly a burden she carried.

Now are these issues any different than a single woman with no kids who has issues, or any different that the issues I carry with me? Nope. But because there is an easily identifiable source her issues are baby-daddy related in the same way an ex drug addict's problems or issues would be considered drug related, even if they were the same issues."

I_FUCK_UP_RECIPES,AskMen,1390489376.0,"I wanted to marry a girl who was a virgin prior to meeting me and did so.  I was a huge slut.  My reason is pretty simple: I get a huge ego kick out of taking a girl's virginity and like being completely in control in the bedroom.  That's it.  I waited a year and change before it happened with my her when we were dating--worth it.  

She has a different ""hypocritical issue""--it really upsets her when we run into my exes (it's impossible not to--I have a lot of them and many are dating friends of mine) and she's mad one of them was invited to our wedding (friend's longtime gf) when the one guy she dated before me was her male best friend after they broke up, and he was IN our wedding.  Apparently he was going to try to date her again right before she met me, so he had held a torch for her a bit.  

He and I bonded a lot, she asked if he could be the ringbearer and I agreed.  He's a great guy, one of my good friends but I prob would have given that role to someone else if she had not requested it.  But I wouldn't dream of excluding him from our wedding."

Yes we live in a digital age and the game in question is played over the computer, but the players being coached are still human beings living in close quarters with habits and skills that need to be adjusted through repetitive exercises.  While Tony Dungy is a very insightful football analyst capable of being a coach (again), I doubt anyone would hire him on to coach their team from an ocean away via Skype.

I think there is a certain *je ne sais quoi* that is lost when trying to coach a team over the internet.  When I played sports in my youth my coaches commanded respect and authority, which I feel is something that is very difficult to do over the wires.

ulvok_coven,AskHistorians,1390490369.0,"It is unlikely that anyone crossed Beringia during the last Ice Age. Current theories support that there were likely tundra plants and some animals on Beringia during its ice-free periods, but Canada is a completely other story. There would need to be some miraculous corridor or corridors in Canada (for which there is no evidence) where people could have passed southward to the continent. The northern third or so of North America was massive glaciers, and this was true up until the reopening of the Strait.

What is likely, however, is coastal migration, not overland. Heading along the edge of Beringia would have allowed ample fishing opportunities. Of course, the vast majority of islands they ran into along the way are underwater now, and what they might have left by way of stone tools and waste would be quite difficult to find. But it's a hell of a lot more likely then trudging across the glacier to America. [This paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379100001153) is a good resource.

There, as well, another and rather divisive theory. [This page](http://ows.edb.utexas.edu/site/hight-kreitman/coastal-route-theory) has a cute map and references some of the supposed evidence. The issue isn't whether or not it's technically possible - it certainly is - the issue is more about whether anyone did. It would have been very possible for settlers from Polynesia to reach Chile and vice versa. The Polynesians are very accomplished sailors. But that's quite a bit of open ocean and would have required quite a few people to sail across it.

The DNA evidence is pretty unsure, too, more and more papers are coming out about the supposed DNA similarities and the evidence doesn't strongly support a Polynesian origin. [Sweet potatoes, however,](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/01/22/169980441/how-the-sweet-potato-crossed-the-pacific-before-columbus) might be a bit more compelling. And, in the interest of elegance, the Polynesian origin explains the pre-Clovis [Monte Verde site](http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1873/) better than the Bering coastal one.

EDIT: A Polynesian origin would certainly not exclude a coastal Beringian origin, which I'm not sure if I made clear."

You might have your own projects you have completed, but most good CS students have those too. And they also have the formal / theoretical background that helps you solve complex problems. 

You won't be getting the same education. Being a software engineer isn't about learning a language or just being able to create a simple website. It's about being able to translate complex and abstract user requirements into working software solutions. To get into a more senior role you need both the knowledge and experience of solving problems. During the 4 years of your CS education, you're getting both. And to boot a nice paper that proves you have the experience.

The IT industry is overflowing with low-skilled people who try to bullshit themselves into jobs to difficult for them. Your CV will be in the same pile as theirs.

Do your future me a favor and stick with it. Stuff will get a lot more complex in the coming years so you don't have to worry you won't be challenged (especially since you already ran into issues with basic Math)."

I've had to truncate my volunteer work, because my job is too demanding and doesn't give me time to do it reliably, which makes me look like a flake and feel bad to the community that's doing work that I respect.

Times I'm OK with waiting:

* She's a virgin 
* She's only had sex in committed relationships AND I see potential for that happening between us
* She's comfortable doing other stuff in the bedroom but waits on the specific act of sex


In general, if this is her policy with past guys, I'm not expecting to be an exception.  
If it's not, I'm not willing to be an exception.

First, there is the process of finding a game that fits into whatever number of players you are looking for. The easiest way to find games for a specific player count is to look at GeekLists. Because couples often game together, there are several dozen two-player game lists. However, nearly all of these are based solely on opinion. YMMV. 

Other lists, such as the one /u/phil_s_stein [provided below](http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/141509/how-many-players-play-this-2012-edition), take a more analytic approach. However, you will note from the title that the list is dated for 2012. If you are looking for 2-player games from 2013, you're out of luck.

The next step would be to used the advanced search option on BGG. However, this will capture ANY game that allows 2 players, not games that are best. When I first started looking for 2-player games, I narrowed down the criteria: games published since 2000, average user rating of 5, with a minimum of 100 votes. In other words, any game that came out in the last decade or so that is somewhat decent. I sorted by rating and went down the list. This is still a LOT of games, but it will narrow it down to games that are most likely still in print or available used, and games that had some sort of success enough to garner 100 player votes. 

And then the final step, and the most tedious. You actually have to go into the poll results, which is a pain in the arse. Lots of times you will find these poll results less than helpful, especially on contentious games where voters weigh in solidly in two separate camps: some hate the two-player and others love it. *(Sometimes, the two-player version of the game is a variant on what is actually a 3+ player game, which I find upsetting. It is incredibly rare to find a game that relies on special rules to achieve a two-player session that simultaneously captures the essence of the 3+ player game.)* 

Hours later, you'll realize you just spent your afternoon wading through forum threads from 2008, sifting through a debate on whether or not 2 player is worth it and what rule changes people have suggested, only to remain as confused as when you began. (If you've managed to avoid this step, congratulations, you're a better person than I.)

Thankfully, this is not always the case. More often than not, the vast majority of people recommend a game for a certain player count or don't. The results will be clear. My rule of thumb for poll results is that if ~60-80% (+/- 5% or so, depending on your interest in the game) of combined voters who voted ""Best with"" or ""Recommended"" it's usually an good or excellent 2-player experience.

In order to save myself from having to do this tedious process over and over again, I have tagged and categorized all the games I'm interested in. When I'm done checking out all the stats, etc. I put a custom tag at the bottom: ""2-player"" for games that are recommended for 2, and ""best-with-2"" for games when the ""best with"" category outnumbers the ""recommended"" category. I have a third category for ""two-player-only."" Using these tags, I can go back and sift through [all the tags](http://imgur.com/a/a9BKn) to find whatever category it is I'm looking for.

Now you may be thinking, ""Man, this guy is nuts! Tagging all those games? There must be hundreds of games!"" And yes, this is all true. However, these tags were added slowly, a handful at a time, over the course of a year and a half. They are very convenient. (If you'd like to peruse my tags, feel free: [2-player](http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/2-player/user/schm0), [2-player-only](http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/2-player-only/user/schm0), [best-with-2](http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/best-with-2/user/schm0). It is not an all-inclusive list, just the games I have been interested in. Maybe it will help.)

Not all of these suggestions may be entirely useful to you, but they're the results of what I've done to work around the shortcomings of the BGG site. You may find that a simple geeklist is enough to get you started. But in case you wanted to dive a bit deeper, I thought I'd share what I do. 

In either case, good luck finding the game you want! :)

lsirius,stepparents,1390491394.0,"I got married when I was 24 to my husband who had two kids from a previous relationship.  We have the kids EOWe and summers.  It's not been easy.  We do not have a good relationship with BM and she has tried to hinder my relationship with the skids every step of the way.  I love the kids, but there has been some resentment from me toward them because they mean dealing with BM.

I also struggle with not having freedom.  I have a really good support system in family and friends who live close to us, and I lean on them heavily.  For example, I usually go out by myself with friends at least once while they're here, and I also have friends over to drink wine and watch football.  I also do things alone with the kids--play dates, walks, tennis, and we do things as a family--board games, cooking dinner.  

Personally, I would not choose this relationship situation again.  I love my husband to death, and if he weren't so amazing, I would have peaced years ago.  We've been together for 6 years and married for nearly 3.  

I guess my feelings are generally anger and helplessness because I can't do what I initially planned on doing as I started my early 20s, and I feel like I'm pinned into insta-family who the vocal minority really doesn't want me to be a part of, and I have about 0 control of the kids and how they're being raised when they're at BM's the majority of the time.

It also depends for you on how often dad is getting kids.  In some ways, I think it would be better if the kids were here full time, because everything would be more stable and routine, but on the other hand, I really enjoy time with just my husband.  

I mean, I guess you just have to decide what your role is going to be.  I decided to be an aunt, and I engage with the kids when I want to, and other times I find something else to do.  My husband's support is paramount to this.  "

superspeck,HomeImprovement,1390491785.0,"One house I helped with near Houston (not IN Houston, in an outlying burb with better code and real zoning) needed a pony panel and 500 feet of wire to come anywhere close to code for the kitchen. Since he was adding a pony panel and thereby altering the box, he needed to move the box to the exterior of the structure to comply with current code, add hardwired smoke and CO detectors, and add AFCIs for bedrooms. AFCIs didn't work on his house because it was built in the 60s with aluminum wire, but the building department didn't give a shit, so we ended up pulling entirely new copper 12/2 and 12/3 to most of the house. We couldn't find an electrician who was willing to pull a permit for us and allow us to do some of the work to keep costs down, so we ended up pulling a permit under the homeowner's homestead rights, and having the electrician work under our permit on the box. As an amateur, I don't touch utility connections past the box.

$20,000 later... even with us doing most of the wire pulling and fishing ourselves... on a $150,000 house... 

We were lucky that it was a 60s ranch house on a slab in the south, which means that we had access via the attic to pull new wire and didn't have to worry much about vapor barriers and such. (Zone II FTW.) The only thing we really had to do that damaged the inside of the house was to make large enough holes at wall boxes to staple the wire above the box, and the only thing we had to add was sealing attic penetrations with canned foam.

I couldn't imagine doing the same work to a house that was insulated with spray foam or built to a seismic code. Or any of those prefab building segments that are becoming popular. "

marinersalbatross,TrueTrueReddit,1390492240.0,"&gt; but the most efficient practice will win out.

This isn't really fully true.  The reason it appears more efficient is because the company only has to take care of someone for a set amount of time and then they can be disposed of, but the society has to take care of that person from cradle to grave.  So once again, business leaders fall back on the privatize profits and socialize losses rationale for their approach. 

It's an approach that is even demonstrated in the Bible when owners were allowed to beat their slaves.  If the slave died right away, then the owner was in trouble; but if the slave lived to walk away and die later then it was ok. Our business owners drive employees until they are worn out husks, then release them. Since they survived the employment the business doesn't have to care for them anymore."

The kids/hubs family live about an hour &amp; a half away from us, and hubs does ALL the driving, and the birthday party is on Saturday in the middle of the day, so it would equal 9 hours of driving or so if they wanted to go and he also wanted his visitation, which again, he won't know until he gets them away from her."

Ebu-Gogo,AskWomen,1390492828.0,"I think people are simplifying this too much.

Yes, it is good that masculinity is seen as less of a superpower and more of a minor influence. I think it's good that men are starting to identify themselves more as individuals, rather than some monolithic MAN.

But it is true that right now, women get increasingly more support for individualism. The difference being that we have feminism to help us with this, even if sexism is definitely not over yet. But while there's feminism for women, men don't have a 'movement' to establish themselves with. Men's Rights, while okay in concept, fails in execution. Feminism helps men, but it won't be capable of giving them the same support they give to women. 

So men end up with a difficult choice. They either conform or end up with a massive identity crisis where they seemingly have to choose between two extremes (one of them being things like TRP). 

I do think, however, that not only men suffer this kind of problem. I think it's part of our modern focus on individualism above group-thinking. Even feminism is no longer one movement, it's now divided into so many subgroups that it's gotten confusing for outsiders.  So you're a feminist as a woman? Well, what kind of feminist? Do you support so-and-so rights? You're not *that kind* of feminist, are you? Are you TERF? Intersectional? And so on.

This focus has its benefits, but there's problems with it too and it creates different problems for men and women. Men feel like they lose that sense of belonging in a group. Women get lost trying to stop being part of a group."

I agree with your bullet points.  Yes, it tells the kids that time with mom and husband's family is more important than time with dad and me.  We don't have anything set in stone for that weekend, but the kids do enjoy being here and we always come up with something fun/special to do.  

I guess the problem is we've done it in the past, so it's easier to do it again.  I'm not sure that after 7 years we can just stop doing it.  If we say we won't take them to the party ahead of time, she will try and withhold the kids, and I don't think that's healthy for anyone.  So what do you think we should do about that?"

Qieth,loseit,1390493155.0,"There is a bit more to it than that. I eat 1000 calories to lose weight. I've been eating 1000 calories for the last 8 months to lose the 120 lb I have. Of course, there are slipups (quite a few actually) and I am not above eating my share when eating out. But the 1k calories are for weight loss. 

IF does not really have anything to do with weight loss. In this context, it's a hunger control. Once I reach my target weight, I plan to continue fasting but with a normal calorie intake to maintain my weight. I've only been IFing for about three months, but I prefer this eating pattern over 3-6 meals a day. I was losing the same amount of weight when I ate throughout the day. 

I think the main difference between IF and an eating disorder is the control factor. I have absolutely no problem eating any meal, but I choose not to. I work out on an empty stomach. But I also feel it if I don't eat enough. I didn't eat enough yesterday, and right now I feel very hungry. Actually, I felt the hunger this morning, which I usually don't - it'd currently 5 PM and I'm on my way home, and you can bet that I'll start cooking immediately when I get home. 

Anyways, I think I'm rambling now. Long story short is that fasting works well for me. I get to keep my calorie deficit to lose weight, but I get to make some rather extravagant evening meals for the 1000 calories I have on my budget. I have a lot of energy and I am losing weight. But fasting isn't for everyone, and I think that anyone with a history of eating disorders should be very careful before choosing to start fasting. But them again, there is really no difference between eating once a day or ten times a day. "

lascalaveras,raisedbynarcissists,1390493161.0,"Well, a lot of people on here are telling you this is a bad situation for you, and obviously you already know the same thing or else you wouldn't be looking for a way out.

I just have a few words on your feelings of isolation.

First - it seems pretty clear that your mother is creating that isolation by constantly hovering over you and not letting you out.  The worst part, is you are letting her.  But you don't seem to see that YOU and only you can break that.

Second - yes, being on your own can be lonely sometimes.  But it can also help you grow as a person and expand your experiences and you can be proud of what you can handle/ accomplish on your own when you try.  You'll learn you don't need other people's company, approval or acceptance.  That's what independence is.

It will take time, but you'll find people to be friends with eventually.  Do you think you'll be less isolated staying under your mother's constant watch?

You need to take control of this situation and your mom and no one is going to give you permission to do so.  It's something you have to do on your own.  It is so hard to disregard other people's opinions or ideas, but your life is your own and you decide how to live it.  Either by deciding to make your own decisions or deciding to let your mother make them for you.  Right now you've decided to let your mother run your life.  But that doesn't make you happy.

You can do this.  You can.  The worst that will happen is you don't make rent and have to come back home for a while.  But that's okay too.  You'll just try again.  It happens to so many people and they survive it - you can too.

I don't know if it's through therapy or just making a decision that your voice/opinion/ thoughts matter.  I don't know.  But you're not happy now, so you don't have much to lose on that front.

Give yourself a chance to be happy and please don't worry about being scared to make changes.  Everyone feels that fear and worry.  But you do it anyway.  You do the things that scare you sometimes to gain the biggest rewards.  And not everything works out - but you learn what you can from those experiences too and you do it better the next time.

I think you need a job and once you make enough to be on your own - you can take that leap.

Best of luck to you, and if you ever need to talk, feel free to pm me.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390493191.0,"""Low Libido"" is a general umbrella term that can cover a range of completely unrelated issues.  From ""Has sexual desire, but extremely conservative/religious upbringing mean s/he has extremely negative ideas about sex"" to ""Very sex positive but due to medical reason, experiences no sexual desire"" to ""likes sex OK, but desires only rarely,nothing wrong with the emotionally/physically, just has a lower sex drive than average.""

So there's a million different reasons.  You know your GF better than us, so you probably have a better understanding of why she's so LL.  But it sounds like she has an immature emotional relationship to sex and the body for starters.

LL doesn't cause selfishness.  Generous LL people will often have sex they don't want to have to keep their partner happy.  Most of the HL's that end up in here have fairly selfish partners, though, becuase otherwise they wouldn't be upset or even really know that they're with an LL.

You are too young for this.  Your gf's anxiety isn't her fault, but not being willing to work with you on this issue IS.  "

You explained my philosophy well enough.  Sometimes I do hunt people for sport, but mostly I raid for sport.  Killing people for their resources is just a driver for end-game mechanics I want to participate in.  Ironically, raiding is sanctioned in these people's minds while killing naked people isn't and there is no difference between the two.  You have something I want so I'm taking it by force.

Ultimately, this game and DayZ before it are simply demonstrations of how violence is a much shorter and easier route to gains than peaceful cooperation.  ""Bandits"" are capitalists.  We exploit someone else's labor and then we use our growing personal economies to destroy competition while continuing to exploit labor.

Now surely we can agree that if we took all PvP from Rust and played it cooperatively, we could do far more, far more quickly than if we simply kill each other all day.  That would be great for community stability.  It would also be incredibly boring over time.

Fact is, people need bandits and raiders and people who KoS to keep their game fresh.  Most people don't want to put forth, let alone possess, the energy and creativity to drive non-structural gameplay forward.  Bandits do.  We have a clear goal, and that goal drives all other aspects of the gameplay for every other player, whether people want to admit it or not.  "

I thought I should be happy since I was at a prestigious university double-majoring and minoring in areas I initially believed I enjoyed, but I came to the realization a little too late that I couldn't see myself working in those fields as a career. I had a nervous breakdown of sorts, became severely depressed, and it was all just a mess. I trudged through it all but somehow ended up working in a field completely unrelated... so in the end, I suppose things worked out for me so far as I do enjoy my work. Looking back, I didn't really receive much pressure from my mom compared to many of my peers. My brother even ended up switching from physics to a music major at the last minute during his junior year of college.

Several of my friends had it much worse. Many of them were pressured into their studies and current fields by their parents, who often stressed future financial success and job security at utmost importance. This usually meant pursuing the stereotypical doctor/pharm/lawyer/engineer/finance route, which are wonderful and rewarding fields to enter assuming one isn't sacrificing their own happiness and well-being. A good friend went through a meltdown semi-recently where she quit her job at a major audit firm in order to get her shit together and stop hating her life. After a while, she ended up going back to one of the Big Four... for the money.

Back in school, several of my friends mentioned their parents would cut all funding and have them leave the university after learning their children wished to switch majors to something they preferred. On the other side, I also had a friend from Korea who really wished to pursue her medical career in the States, but her parents wanted her to return home after undergrad to get married and become a traditional housewife."

keypuncher,conservatives,1390493676.0,"&gt; I wouldn't say his goal was to drive up the price of energy, rather drive up the price of fossil fuels, specifically coal and oil, in order to cause the market to shift to something else, be it solar, wind, or natural gas. 

The problem with this is that the reason we are not currently using those technologies instead of coal and oil is because they are much more expensive - so the only way to push the market into using alternative energy is to make fossil fuels even more expensive than alternative - in some cases that would require increasing energy costs by an order of magnitude or more.

&gt; He's been very good for the natural gas and fracking industries and he's let those industries thrive. 

The EPA is forcing the closure of some natural gas power plants with its emissions rules, and fracking seems to have caught the administration off guard.  Look for the EPA to regulate the hell out of it before much longer.

&gt; Either way, the current ""Obama recovery"" is still about debt that we are trapped in.

You're right, but that is only a small part of it.  With the administration pushing Amnesty and increased regulation on business, we're going to continue to see high unemployment (and no, I am not talking about the official number here, which doesn't count long-term unemployed).  With half of the country on some form of government assistance, more than a third of working-age adults unemployed, less than half of working-age adults employed full time, and people avoiding debt due to income insecurity, discretionary income isn't there to purchase goods and services.  Reduced discretionary income means reduced economic activity, which means fewer jobs, etc.

That doesn't even begin to touch on the *real* debt we are trapped in at the national level - we are completely screwed once the interest rate on that goes back up to historically average rates."

Unfortunately, some men will say/do anything to get you into bed, and then they'll disappear off the face of the planet (or simply stop trying as hard). Odds are that there were some ""red flags"" during the first three dates that you simply didn't notice (like suggesting you come over, or over-complementing you, being way too eager about everything, etc.). 

In my experience, if a guy is trying to rush the emotional aspect of the relationship by confessing how much he likes you over and over, talking about the future really early on, and basically feeding you all of the bull that guys think women want to hear, it's because his *primary* goal is to rush the sexual aspect of the relationship. Is this always true? Of course not, but I've come to realize that the main reason a guy will gush over you and pretend like he's ready to rush into a relationship with you is because in reality he only wants to rush into your pants. Avoid over-eager sweet-talkers. In general, avoid anyone who tells you everything you wanna hear because it's likely manipulation."

I don't think this is accurate. Community consensus determines halakhah all the time. Chazal determined that ma'ariv wasn't required, but it is now because the community took it on as an obligation anyway. Several rabbis have attempted to adapt the timing of ""mashiv haruach"" to the local climate, but the community rejected the innovation despite their rabbi telling then too. And what the minhag is in a community is used to determine correct practice all the time, and what makes minhagim obligatory is their community-wide practice, not what rabbis say (see: tashlikh)"

Also thanks for the argument from authority, by the way, I'll bear it in mind. I just can't wait until I'm old enough to pull that kind of thing and think that it has any bearing whatsoever. When does it kick in? Because I'm 30 next year and it's still not happening. 

My opinion is what it is. Yeah, I'm a little jaded- a collector of scars and prejudices. I've made plenty of mistakes. I'm not infallible. 

""How you deal with it is your problem, just as long as I keep getting the attention I want"" is not what I said. At no point have I condoned using someone's affections to your own ends.

I think her confession took a huge amount of balls, and like most adults she looks back on some of her high school days behaviour and cringes. 

This is called growing up. 

When men don't provide the minimum qualifiers, women do start weighing their options. When women don't provide certain minimum qualifiers, men start weighing their options. Healthy, happy, relationships are mutually beneficial. When they become one sided- it's time to reassess.

Personally I think that reassessment should be introspective, geared towards taking control of your own situation and using it to find a positive outcome. Not shirking your responsibilities of self growth and apportioning blame.

Secret_Wizard,AskReddit,1390494860.0,"All I know is that I have played no other games with such an extensive laundry list of things I have a beef with, and such an incredibly short list of things I liked. I liked the look of the playable races (especially compared to ""potatoblivion""), I liked the much improved first and third person animations, I liked the voice acting (though maybe not the dialogue), and I liked the dungeon designs (both layouts and aesthetics). Everything else about Skyrim I either dislike compared to how earlier games in the series handled stuff, or am indifferent to. The game feels like it was made like a Jackson Pollock painting, with no attempt to balance anything.

When it comes to most games, it's usually 70% stuff I like, 30% stuff I don't. Or maybe it's 70% stuff I don't like, 30% I do. 

I like 1% of Skyrim. That makes it the worst game I've played, in my eyes. Yeah, I've never played stuff like Big Rigs, Super Man 64, Sonic '06, Aquaman: Battle for Atlantis, and the like. It'd be boring to count those even if I had."

[Here's a skirt that makes me think of a little girl dressed up for a birthday or somethings](http://www.danischoice.com/product/cute-plaid-flared-mini-skirt/)

[And this blouse is pretty much the essence of what I was thinking](http://cdnc.lystit.com/photos/2012/07/27/river-island-cream-short-sleeve-blouse-with-bow-tie-product-4-4301273-026468139_large_flex.jpeg)

To me it seems that it became a pretty common trend in female fashion, ten-ish years ago, to go for the ""cute little-girl outfit with one or two details that contrast it with a very sexual look"". Striped tops, dotted pantyhose, red bows, cutesy cartoon print, and so on.

It makes sense. As a culture we idolize youth and we very deliberately present small children in an overly sexual way in commercials and tv shows. Hell, we could even go as far as considering if the preference for shaved pubic hair and small labia is a result of our sexual imagery becoming more and more inspired by children. Some times I just think we're taking it a bit too far.

I noticed it first time about ten years ago when I was out shopping with (for) a girl-friend of mine. I saw some really great pantyhose in a window and, before looking closer, i turned to my friend and pointed them out to her. She immediately agreed that they'd be really sexy with the rest of the things we had found. And then we both, pretty much at the same time, noticed that it was a children's clothing store. We spent the next two hours discussing if there is a feasible way to wash your brain with soap and acid :D

But yea, I've just been noticing it ever since. It's not all women's fashion that is like that. Not at all. But I still, pretty often, see young women wear clothing that seem more like it should be worn by a small girl. And it's sexy! I'm not really attracted to females myself, but it's still pretty obvious. That ""innocent little girl""-look *is* sexy. The problem is when the line becomes so blurry that it's hard to tell the difference between ""sexy"" innocence and *actual* innocence. "
wingchild,ffxiv,1390495197.0,"My Coil team's method: 

P4: bugs all die as P5 starts.

P5: MT picks up Dread, OT picks up Soldier/Knight. Magic takes Soldier, Melee takes Knight, team steamrolls the adds. Spends the last 25 seconds or so beating P5 Dread.

P6: MT picks up Dread, OT picks up Soldier/Knight/Bug/Rook. MT and OT blow cooldowns as appropriate. OT kites the group away from the dreads.

DPS focuses in the following order: 

* Rook (most dangerous)
* P5 Dread (marked) 

At this point OT swings back up near MT and feeds the bug to the P6 Dread, which ups its damage (heal doesn't matter, nobody's hit it) in exchange for taking one enemy off the field. DPS continues: 

* Soldier/Knight
* P6 Dread 

Healers are split; one has MT, one has OT/Raid. Raid damage should be light if people are fighting well. 

We've been doing it this way for five or six weeks straight, no problems. We run double PLD so have two Hallowed Grounds to trip in the fight. We don't bother having DPS hold the Rook because we don't always have melee along, and our OT's got things under control. 

My full fight description's up at http://talesofbindingcoil.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/analysis-turn-4-elevator-gauntlet/ if you wanna review how we handle each phase, as well. "

* If someone else brings it to my attention either verbally, or in baseball they used to ""move in"" because I'm small.  I was a scrappy hitter, but had more power than they expected.  Nothing felt better than belting one over their heads.

One of my best guy friends has told me before that he was interested. I never really noticed because I had a lot of long term boyfriends and he was always very respectful of that and never said/did anything inappropriate.

Once I was single did I realize that he was making advances. What was once an innocent movie between the two of us, now seemed like a date. I explained to him that I love him and he's a great friend but I wasn't interested and didn't think we were compatible.

I'm not sure how he feels about it now but he had every reason to stop being friends with me in order to get over the crush. However, he never did. We're still really great friends and he tells me about the girls he dates and is welcome for me setting him up.

I would just worry how you feel after. Can you forget about it? She might be able to, or at least act normal again but if you can't move on, I wouldn't put yourself in that situation."

Ingmundar,canada,1390495344.0,"The problem is that still leads to similar problems. Instant runoff is better than MMP but it still doesn't lead effectively to proportional rep. Here's an example - the Bloc and the Green Party often have similar sized share of the vote. Support for the Greens is disperse, while support for the Bloc is concentrated. The result is that (with the exception of the last election) the Bloc can lock down 30-40 seats and the Greens struggle to win a single seat. 

The over advantage of MMP is that every vote counts. If I support the Liberals in Calgary or the Conservatives in Quebec City, my vote still contributes to the percentage of seats that my preferred party receives regardless of my geographic location.

Also under MMP, proportional seats are still a minority. The system can work effectively with only ~30% of members being proportional. And under our current system how much say do MPs get based on their riding? They're more or less stonewalled by party lines already. Maybe under an MMP, it might be slightly liberating. The proportional reps tow party lines but the representative reps get a bit more leeway to vote on behalf on constituencies. "

lsirius,relationships,1390495568.0,"No, he didn't leave her for me--they had been divorced for 5 years before he met me, and for 8ish before we got married.  They are just all nuts, to be honest.  They all live about an hr and a half from us and hang out together all the time, so I think they've put their bets on the horse that has the children closer.  They consider her their daughter, and that did not change at all after the divorce.  They paid for her lawyer to help her get custody even though she had no way to financially support the kids--they moved in with my husband's family.

There's nothing missing.  In fact the last time we went to a family event (mine and hubs first Christmas together, 5 years ago) and BM was there she started screaming at them for not giving her enough money for Christmas, so we took the kids and went to a movie then went home.  They seem to be in denial about her behavior, and I'd guess it's because she uses them seeing the kids to get the financial help that she needs, and we don't need their financial help--aka like I'll let you see the kids if you'll give me money for x.

Hub's mom and aunt were both left by men with kids, so they have this hate men thing going on as well. Hub's biodad left mom with him and his sister never to be heard from again, and hub's mom is still angry about this.  I've been told my husband looks a lot like his biodad which is most likely part of it.

Hubs already has pretty much cut contact and after their lunch when she said he should just get over it, he has not spoken to her at all.  We went to counseling about it, and it's just a hard thing to do.  They've been total shits to me and expected me to just suck up her and their crappy behavior ""For the kids,"" and all of us be one big happy dysfunctional family.  This is normal for them.  It was normal for my husband before I pointed out it wasn't and we went to counseling to help him come to terms with that.  It's hard for him though because even though his rational brain knows that they treat him like crap, cutting them off means he's left without any family besides me.  And when I say his family does it, I mean it.  His mom is like matriarch of the family and she and her two sisters gang up on anyone who doesn't kowtow to his mother.

We haven't gone to any family events in 3 years, and they haven't learned.  They think we should just switch and let BM take them or get over it and come play nice. "

It's a shame real ale cannot travel far; I had some this winter in Upstate NY, and I could tell it was spoiled.  The bar I had it was pretty cool though, run by students from Sheffield.  http://theoldtoad.com/

As far as I know, in the US, there is only one brewery making real ale.

Very young women would do well to head the advice I would give my daughter. Don't fall prey to the same mistakes her older peers were lured into. Unfortunately once the carousel ride starts in earnest there is no real path to renewed chaste. Jumping on the carousel is, by all you promote on this sub, a mistake. Mistakes, even ones made in ignorance, have consequences.

It would just be feel good bullshit to advise any woman wanting to reform her carousel days that it's perfectly okay to begin behaving like an 18 year old virgin. Her best bet would be to accept the possibility that she might have to share a man until she proves her LTR value. It's only a possibility... not every high value man has a 7 girl harem for every day of the week. In fact most don't. The simple fact that he is pursuing you would mean that none of his current options are offering him enough value to hard commit to them."

Capitalizing ""He"" or ""Him"" is more shaky grammatical territory because there's no rules stating that pronouns other than ""I"" should be capitalized, but I think it makes the most sense to adhere to the rule governing whether you capitalize ""god"" or not. If you're talking about a Christian God, say ""He"", regardless of whether you think He exists. If you're talking about god in a more generalized sense, not referring to any specific god, say ""he"", ""she"", ""it"", ""xer"" or whatever pronoun you feel like using.

If someone believes in God and they choose to capitalize ""God"" that's their prerogative. It's fair to assume that Pope France is talking about a Christian God, so although I'm not religious at all, I do think it is correct to capitalize ""God"" in this article and address Him with the pronoun ""He"".

partspace,GirlGamers,1390496518.0,"&gt; In their defence, feminism is mostly about women. 

And that's okay, for all the reasons we already discussed. There's this idea that being pro-women automatically means anti-man, which feeds back into that misogynist idea of the genders needing to be adversarial. 

&gt;feel that feminism is an ideology for privileged western women.

And that is a very valid criticism. Part of the intersectionality movement of the third wave is to address exactly that. It's also why FEMEN is so shitty and we all hate them.

&gt;Personally I think the concept ""straw feminism"" is dangerous, because it represents willful ignorance of the large amount of extremists within the ideology, as if pretending that they don't exist will make them go away.

We don't pretend they don't exist. We're completely ignored in favor of focusing on these extremist elements to discredit the entire movement. The idea of women being better or more powerful than men is directly against what feminism stands for. I don't want to pull a no-Scotsman, but the prevailing belief that feminists hate men and want to chop off every testicle is wrong.

I don't think you can be in a relationship for someone else. You've got to do it for yourself, as hard as that can be sometimes, because the alternative is the road to hell. 

Did OP ruin his friendship with this girl? Time will tell. I doubt he's going to come back and tell us about it. Speaking personally, having been the side of unrequited love that was unable to reciprocate in a romantic way- yes it did damage our friendship really severely, it didn't ruin it, but I couldn't trust him the way I had trusted him before. I actually became a little scared of him. I was hurt. He was hurt. He mourned. I mourned. It was a difficult time for us both, but it was the rubicon moment for him that allowed him to move on. Through all the heartbreak and turmoil, time and space, we really learned a lot about ourselves. 

That's the risk you take when you enter into any relationship with a person. Life takes a lot of courage. It's not for the faint of heart. 

I can't pinpoint the time when we all got so bad at communicating with each other. When we became so afraid of opening up. I mean, I can do it for myself (holy shit what a damaging debacle that was). But not for everyone else, though I do think it's the dark side of growing up for us all. "

OmniaMors,dataisbeautiful,1390496875.0,"So some info:

[9x19](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9%C3%9719mm_Parabellum) is one of the most pistol cartridges used. I just bought 500 from a company that re-manufactures them. This is the process where used brass casings are refilled with a new bullet, primer, and propellant, as shown [here](http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/revolver-bullet.gif).

now when making bullets one of the more common mistakes is to have the wrong [cartridge overall length (COAL)](http://www.bergerbullets.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SAAMI-COAL-1024x654.jpg). 

The short story is that having too long of a COAL could lead to feeding (process by which the bullet is moved from the magazine to the chamber) while having too short of a COAL could lead to over-pressuring in the chamber because of the [ideal gas law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law). So having the cartridge too long is ""less bad"" than too short.

So being a nerd i decided to do some stats and measured all 500 cartridges with a caliper accurate to 0.001 inches. I then plotted the data here.

Overall the rounds had an average length of 1.138048 inches with a standard deviation of 0.00147767 across them. The distribution, however, was non-symmetrical especially if outliers were excluded.

Whats interesting is you can see how the goal COAL was probably 1.1375 and the manufacturer made sure the machines were biased to being too long rather than too short.

I should note that the outliers are only 0.007 inches out, which is within the factor of safety to still be ok to fire.

for more info check out /r/guns /r/Firearms /r/longrange and /r/reloading 

edit: i didnt label my axes, now i feel stupid. The Y is number of cartridges, and the X is the COAL. the Y value is shown at the top of each bar."

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1390496954.0,"Normally I'd suggest you stop being open and focus on your marriage for now.  It's clear your husband isn't at all OK with being polyamorous right now.

However, the way he's expressed that he doesn't like this is not just bullying - it's crossing the line into verbal abuse.  Threatening to leave you, throw you out, divorce you, and accusing you of cheating are all ways abusers try to control their victims.

Is this totally out of the blue behavior from him?  Or does he has a history of trying to control you via tantrums and threats?  Be honest.

If he does, I think you should give serious reconsideration to whether you want to be in an abusive relationship that will continue to escalate.  If this is totally not the ""usual him"" over all the time you've known him, then as Neemii said so well, you have to shut down being poly for now, and really work together about whether you can be poly or not, and how important being poly is to you (more important than your marriage?  hard choices will have to be made, most likely.)

The_Dacca,truegaming,1390497072.0,"I think this is a great topic to discuss as it's something that we see often but rarely bring up in a civil discussion.  I think that the names people give themselves reflect how they want to play the game and how they want others to see them taking the game, either seriously or not.  From working at a Laser Quest Center I can tell you that watching people pick a name for themselves can tell a lot from what they want from the experience and can usually be classified into a few categories: 

Parody:  These are the most obvious and are intended to be either make fun of the experience or make the experience more fun.  Players who pick a name to parody something (anything) either want to make the game more fun for themselves or others around them.  The main focus of these players is to have fun rather then take the game seriously. 

Self Assessive:  These are players who pick a name that they feel expresses part of who they are or their interested.  These are players who want to express themselves or be themselves in game.  These are the more common players who just want to play the game.  

Self Assertive:  These are players who want to be taken seriously so take names to be taken seriously.  These are more aggressive names and more of the (as already stated by u/Dr_Scientist_) ADJECTIVE DESCRIBING MORTALITY MILITARY NOUN or 1337-$nyp3RW0lf-420noskopez *et al*.  These are the usual '13 year old cod kid' and/or players who pick these names because they are serious and want to be taken seriously.  

Generic/non-descriptive:  These are names that are usually one or two nouns followed by some numbers.  These are players who can't think of a name and either chose one at random or something that sounds good at the time.  When asked why they picked their name they will usually say 'I don't know' or 'it sounds cool'.  

While these are huge generalizations, this is what I've noticed in my time playing games.  These groupings may not apply to everyone and I'm sure I am missing some as well, but in short your name reflects both who you are and your attitude towards the game.  

TD;LR: your name reflects both who you are and your attitude towards the game.

And by ""religious"" I mean that he actually thought of himself as a catholic and believed in god. But he'd go to church maybe 10 times a year. The church as an institution - and often as a landowner - still has some money and power, but religion as a relevant element in private and public life is basically over.

I mean, we tend to react instinctively on visual cues. 

When I see a nice tight ass or a muscular back I am thinking about sex long before the analytical part of my brain is finished with processing the rest of the data. And since it has become acceptable (hell, even expected) for fucking BOYS to spend hours every day at the gym and taking every kind of supplement and/or hormone available, I've actually had a couple of experiences where I desperately try to backpedal my initial mental reaction because I don't want to feel like a fucking creep.

I honestly think it's just the reality we're living in now. Things change and we can't realistically expect to not have to change with them. Perhaps the whole ""you should not be attracted to people outside your age range"" is simply outdated, because we're no longer realistically able to tell the difference at a glance. Perhaps the ""new and improved"" model should be something like ""You can be attracted to whatever the fuck you want but you keep your goddamn hands, words and genitals to yourself until you know if that attraction is defensible"" :D"

If you don't have a great friends/family relationship to help you through, try meeting some new people. Meeting new people and seeing how they interact with you and like you will help with the confidence.

Best places to meet people at 18 is probably work or school. Try getting a job as a waiter. You'll be introduced to a whole new group of people and potentially make some new friends.

Also, never say ""no"" to an invite out (assuming you can actually go). You never know who you'll meet or what new memories you'll make! Good luck!"
t-bass,audioengineering,1390497971.0,"That's possible, but you can combine an Apollo Quad with your Octo and have twelve cores, or sell the octo, get a quad, and have eight cores. You apparently can't merge a Twin and an Apollo or PCIe, but you can merge an Apollo and a PCIe.

I doubt that the reasoning for a non-quad Apollo is heat, it's probably cost vs expected sales. Those that need an Octo SHARC generally either need much more than the I/O that the Apollo offers, or are mix-only studios that don't need preamps at all. I would expect an Octo Satellite before an Octo Apollo, primarily for new Mac Pro users.

no_real_username,AskMen,1390498373.0,"Honestly, it's not that different from what women do on dating sites. trust me, it's not just guys who ""describe themselves as average/normal"", nor is it only guys who send one-word messages like ""hey"", or answer likewise, with a single word no matter what they're responding to.

And most people have a hard time viewing themselves from the outside, and considering ""how would someone else read this?"" It's easy to write something that *you* think does the job, but which just makes you look like a braindead idiot to anyone else.

But nonetheless, a few thoughts on each of those:

&gt; A lot of guys (at least in my area) describe themselves as average and normal. To me this equates to boring and dull, wouldn't you want to be perceived as above average and super cool?

""I'm modest and not full of myself""

&gt; Some tell really weird, not funny or offensive jokes in the first messages

""I'm *not* ""normal and average"". I am quirky and have a weird sense of humor and think outside the box""

&gt; A lot of the pictures I see make no sense to me at all. Some guys just make no effort what so ever: obviously dirty clothes, bad lighting, blurry web cam etc. While others are downright terrifying like photoshopping the picture to look like a zombie. Why would they not want to put their best face forward so to speak?

Lots of options for this one: ""I don't really have many pictures of myself, so here's whatever I could find"", or ""I don't have a decent camera, and I'm not going to buy one just to show you a better profile picture"", or ""I don't need to impress you with how handsome I am. If you don't find it intriguing that I photoshopped the picture to look like a zombie, then you're just a boring and unimaginative person"" (Remember what you said above about not wanting people to be ""average"". And yet you object when people put unusual photos up which clearly have a story/conversation hook attached to them? (Why did you photoshop it like that?) ;)

&gt; Then there are the seemingly never ending pictures of cars. Of all the women I have ever met, sure a few care that a guy drives a nice car

Sure, and showing ""this is my car"" is a bit more convincing than just writing in your profile ""also, I have a nice car"", don't you think? Alternatively, ""I care about my car. If you don't, then maybe my profile is not directed at you""

A fair bit of what you point out is really just people showing some of their personality, rather than erecting a fake façade to make them look like something they're not. If I think my car is extremely important and impressive, and I want to meet a girl who respects that or agrees with it, then I'll put up a picture of my car. If I have terrible personal hygiene, then why would I pretend to be newly washed and in clean clothes on my picture? Anyone to whom that matters are going to be turned off once they meet me anyway.

And honestly, you sound pretty picky. On one hand, the guy should post conventional photos and not tell weird anecdotes, stories or jokes. On the other hand, they shouldn't be normal, average, dull or boring?

Your profile is supposed to appeal to the kind of person you'd actually be a reasonable match with. Why try to impress someone who would hate you if they met you? It's possible that most of those profiles are just not intended for you. They're intended for girls who like guys who obsess about their cars, or girls who don't care that the guy can't wash his own clothes and has to be told when to shower, or girls who find it funny and charming when the guy posts a photo where he looks like a zombie.

I you find all those unappealing, then you're obviously not who they're searching for.

The major work religions need death in order to work. Remove any mention of it, and they fall apart, I feel. In the early chapters of the Bible, death is used a threat for questioning their deity, breaking laws or committing thought crimes. Later in the same book it introduces the concept of heaven and hell (it sorta forgot to mention that early on). Some might even say that death itself is a ""god,"" or the only ""god."" However, with the march of progress, science and medicine we are living longer. We can soon tailor genes to get rid of diseases and inherited problems. And future generations will see death as something that only happens in accidents. Beyond those eras, maybe it can be overcome entirely. IF that happens, who needs an afterlife?"

He leaves and comes back about 15 minutes alter with a ball of aluminum foil. Bo stole some money from his apron (about $50) and paid the guy and he left. I didn't really think anything of it. Next thing I know, Bo is yelling and cussing and beyond pissed off. He had tried to buy drugs off of the guy and he ripped him off and just gave him the ball of aluminum foil. So he takes off out of the game and goes to his room and grabs a knife and wants to go find this guy. Now, we were in a small town in the middle of nowhere, so he just started asking everyone at the carnival where the black people in town lived. Long story short, he found the guy and got his money back. I never asked what happened to the guy who ripped him off though.

Making people wonder ""what is she up to"" can be a pretty good way to get the opposite sex to notice you).

But looking at it from a more serious angle, all you've told us is about your appearance and how attractive you look. I have no idea what you do in real life to get people to notice you, but if you're *only* playing on your looks, then you're handicapping yourself. Why would I pay much attention to someone who looks good, if she also appears as if her looks are the only interesting trait about herself?

I see a fair number of attractive-looking women every day, but why would I ""notice"" them in the way you want, if that is *all* I know about them? I want to see that your personality is interesting too. Do stuff! Whether you're climbing a building, making faces at your friend, wearing a clown nose or reading a book or haranguing the barista at Starbucks, it gives me some characteristics to associate with you, more than just ""she's pretty"".

His dogs are his world and I knew how much they meant to him so that's what I used. When he opened it, he was speechless and actually started tearing up. He said it's the best present he's ever gotten.

You don't need money to make a birthday/holiday special. Just find out what's important to him and try to show him you care :)

Another idea was the ""man bouquet"" I made my brother for his graduation. It was basically a painted beer mug with a bunch of little things sticking out of it (attached to wooden bbq sticks). For example, I used airplane bottles of liquor, candy, money etc. and it looks similar to a bouquet of flowers.

shafonfa,Christianity,1390499000.0,"First off, I don't believe that the 10% applies to us under the New Covenant. Its about the condition of our hearts. A millionaire giving 12% may still be abusing the wealth that God has entrusted him with. A person in poverty struggling to get by may give 5% in love and generosity, and be blessed by God in doing so.

Secondly, the church SHOULD be using a good chunk of the tithe for the poor, for missions, etc. My church allocates about 60% of our giving for local and global missions that serve the poor, love the broken, house orphans, and spread the Gospel in word and deed in many other ways. 

If you cannot trust your church to use the money in appropriate, Kingdom minded ways, there is a deeper problem with the church's giving that needs to be addressed. If you decide to quietly give elsewhere, you do a disservice to the church, the congregation, and the overall body of Christ. 

I know that I would have a major problem being part of a church that spends most of the tithe on things like redecorating the building when so many people globally (and locally) are hungry, hurting, and in need of a Savior."

Do you crave something sweet? How about oatmeal? No way am i going to grab another cup of oatmeal if i make it. I add in raisins, cinnamon, honey and make it with milk. This also comes in around 200 calories. 

The point is...try to arm yourself with alternatives. I know people will say snack on carrots, cucumbers, etc. and maybe one day i'll get there, but right now when i get in that ""i want food"" at night mode...veggies are the last thing that i want. So i try to think of foods that would still give me my craving, fall into the tasty category, and don't kill my daily calories. "

Richie311,wow,1390499485.0,"Well I did it the same as anyone has multiboxed, but yea it was pretty quick. All 5 chars were by me so I was able to get instant queues. On top of that I had the Heirloom helm/cape/legs plus either a shoulder or chest for each of the toons. BOAs are Bind on account and you can send them through the mail to each of your boxing toons. The helm/cape/legs are just gold for each so that was easy. Plus I just got the cloth versions of each so I could use them for each character and not have to buy different ones. 

The only thing odd I saw was that the bonus xp you get for completing a random dungeon was being miscalculated. Normally, for example, lets say you get 10k for completing a TBC Random dungeon on your own. When you join a group with your boxing toons and the RAF bonus kicks in, it says on the queue screen, you're gonna get 30k xp which is normal. But at the actual end of the dungeon when I completed it, I was getting 90k. This happened from level 15 all the way up to 70, it stopped once I got to WOTK dungeons. And the 10k already had the BOA bonus in it, because when I took off my boa gear it would say something like 8k instead of the 10k. "

I shouldn't have tripped again so soon after, but I did. I took the dose (23mg), and while everyone else was coming up, I still wasn't feeling anything. I wanted to experience something like my acid trip again, so I went to my shrooms and ate 3g. First time on either substance. But it wasn't as terrible an idea as I could get it yet -- half an hour later, impatient, I stuffed another 3g into my mouth. I figured I had tolerance from the acid, so that would basically approximate an eighth of shrooms. 
Nope. 
I had a fun time for the first hour. Things started feeling motion-blurred and pretty. I enjoyed some music and watched my friends rolling around on the carpet. I noticed a small discomfort in my torso. It grew slowly. I began to get more and more uncomfortable. My mind receded and dulled; the motion blur took over; I felt almost poisoned. I could barely talk or move. For a while, I thought I might have to go to he hospital. 
I ended up sitting in the bathroom for hours , waiting for the awful feeling to pass, watching the tiles ripple and change colors. Once I could think again, I have never felt so ashamed. I had thought I could control myself around substances. I had thought myself invincible. But I took too much. I did new substances together and hard. I had had to be taken care of. I needed to rethink my life. And so I did. 
I learned it the hard way, but I did learn. Now I will never repeat my mistake, and I have a much healthier attitude and respect towards these substances. "

Sharkictus,technology,1390500218.0,"Eh I was going from a point of general Christianity, not specifically Catholcism. 

General agreement is that the only acceptable time for sexual activity is within a heterosexual marriage. 

Catholics go farther and state sexual activity prime purpose is reproduce, and within heterosexual marriage it has to uninterupted PIV intercourse. A young infertile couple marriage can be annulled because no child is a result. Older couples, if they they have had child, once they get past infertility, still have to be together, and are allowed to have sex. However, older widow, in terms of Catholic's view on sex, would be no point to remarry because she can no longer reproduce, but miracles can happen, so they allow it. However there is the issue of poor families who can't afford more children, and I am not sure if the Catholics interprets long-term abstinence in marriage as a sin, and if they do, this an issue that needs be resolved.  

Condoms prime purpose to prevent conception, STD prevention is more or less a bonus. This not acceptable with the way the Catholic church sees sex. It's not murder like abortion, but still subversion.

Catholic church would have it that if you have an STD, either you marry and remain monogamous and try you best that your offspring doesn't get it through the blood, or you don't get married so you don't have sex if you have an STD. Neither of this is really that unreasonable..

In Protestant Christianity, sex is viewed differently. It's a reproductive action yes, but it mostly an intimate emotional bonding experience of high importance in marriage. Lack of child is acceptable. And they have moved a bit better with the times, in industrial and post-industrial society, children are a financial liability for all economic classes, rather than  just the rich like it used to be (this why richer people always have less children than the masses). Since foolishness is a sin, but so is long-term abstinence in marriage, it's better for a family to limit how many children they can, and it best to do so using contraception.

Also, you can't trust his job to not fuck you over if he gets ill or hurt.

My friend's husband just came down with brain cancer, but has had surgery and has gotten a letter from his doctor clearing him for part time work, but his job fired him behind his back with no notice.

PlushieChomby,relationships,1390500275.0,"Judging by the posts in this sub, it seems to be fairly common *everywhere*. I'd say it's likely because I'm 30 and have had many large spheres of friends throughout my lifetime so far. Come into contact with enough people and you'll eventually meet a cheater or few, though you may be lucky enough to never know it. I haven't been so lucky in a number of circumstances, but really out of the hundreds of friends I've had since my teens, I'd ballpark the number of cheaters I've found out about to be somewhere between twenty and twenty-five over a span of fifteen years. Out of hundreds of people, that's probably around less than five percent of the collective. Judging by [statistics](http://www.statisticbrain.com/infidelity-statistics/) on [how many people cheat](http://www.truthaboutdeception.com/cheating-and-infidelity/stats-about-infidelity.html), that's a lot less than I *should* have known, which means people I knew had probably cheated at some point before or after I knew them, or during and I just never found out.

kornberg,childfree,1390500390.0,"There's nothing wrong with giving boundaries to a kid--so not wanting her to throw things at you and climb on you is totally ok, but you're right in that you could have been nicer about it. 

Usually, when I know I am going to spend time around some kids, I stash some cheap toys in my bag--nothing crazy but (age appropriate) shit like coloring books and crayons, sticker books, play doh, toy cars and other crap like that. If the kid in question starts being a shithead, before I get really annoyed, I stop them and say ""Hey bud, I really don't like it when you do X. Why don't you sit down and play with this sticker book over here?""

Understand that the poor kid probably has very minimal parenting and probably doesn't get out much from the sounds of it and has no idea how to handle herself when she is around other people. Like with a dog, you have to bring the kid around a lot of situations frequently so they get used to it, otherwise, they act like your niece because they are all hyped up and overstimulated because of the COOL NEW DIFFERENT PLACE OMG OMG OMGOMGOMG. Her parents don't take their kids out much and they don't give them direction when they do--she's only 3, she can't really be expected to know how to act if no one shows her. 

Another thing you could do in the future is to tire her out before the game--maybe try to meet up there early and take her out back and chase her for half an hour. She'll be more worn out and will be much happier to play quietly with her sticker book or whatever while you guys watch the game. 

And if she interrupts, just say ""Sally, I am watching the game right now. Please wait and tell me when the commercial is on."" and ignore her until commercial time. Seek her out then and ask her to tell you what she wanted to talk about. By doing that, you're enforcing a boundary and then following through, so she'll be more likely each time to actually listen. It'll take a while to sink in but keep working on it, eventually she'll get it.

I know this shit isn't your job, it's the parents' job. Unfortunately, you have to choose between taking some time and effort with your nieces or having to deal with their bad behavior."

In my experience, yes, pro-lifers want to stop what they see as innocent lives being cut short.

And to this pro-lifers say that adoption is always an option.  There are a number of pro-life organizations that will help a mother to give birth and adopt out.  I think there are also organizations that will help a woman to keep the child, if she wishes.

&gt;What's the use of ''saving a life''...

On the flip side... why is it necessary to ""take a life"" just because the mother isn't ready yet?

&gt;I just don't understand the logic:

I know.  There are many machinations that twist and turn with regard to this isse.  What I am saying is that for most pro-lifers...the vast, vast majority...they view abortion as baby murder.

If you *truly deep down* believed that abortion is baby-murder...wouldn't you want something done about it?

itsjusttoored,KeepWriting,1390501115.0,"This is a good story. I'm not sure if it's believable, but the use of rather understated language goes well toward making Jim a humble, simple man - even his name and job do the same, which is a really nice little feature, and I do feel sympathy towards Jim and his troubles. 

One thing I'd say is that Jim seems to be receiving hostile reactions rather than neutral, 'you're not important' ones which the language generally establishes. Everyone seems to have something against him, what with kicking the trowel and exaggerating pain, that kind of contrasts the 'not important' theme in a slight but noticeable way. I would recommend either making the reactions more circumstantial and ambivalent, or alternatively using more emotive language to paint Jim in such a way that he is seen as a failure, somebody nobody really likes, over just a face in the crowd with some bad luck.

This is my first critique, so please, take it as you will. "

 Here is the reasoning.

The second time, he told him ""In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, rise and walk.""  A few towns later, he was simply walking past and said ""Get up.""

kornberg,childfree,1390501473.0,"It all depends on the relationship OP wants with his family. It sounds like they are fairly close so he probably doesn't want to alienate or distance himself from them--it's not a toxic situation, just annoying. And he's going to his parents' house, not a bar or something so he's not enabling much of anything really. You can't tell someone not to bring their kids to their grandparents' house--that's an acceptable and reasonable place to bring kids. Also, that solves nothing. The kids need to get out more, not less. 

By telling his brother not to bring his kids to their parents' house, he's inviting a lot of conflict--their parents will be pissed, the brother will be pissed and the end result is a more distant and strained relationship with his family. It's much easier and more productive to show the kid how to act around him--he'll maintain a good relationship with his family, which is important to him, and he'll also be a good example for his niece and nephew, which could make them that much less awful people later on.

OP doesn't want her phone to be in a sketchy box. Okay, then don't bring it to class or turn it off, put it in your bag/pocket/whatever. Problem solved.

The response in this post seems to be cut from the same paranoid, entitled cloth. I don't think anybody wants to steal anyone's phone. Do you think the NSA is going to log what level you are on Candy Crush? What are you doing on your phone that's so fucking important?

It reminds me of when I transferred to a new high school in a more affluent area after attending one where over 50% of the kids qualified for reduced lunch. (I transferred because they had more AP classes and language options.) One of the things that stuck out to me the most was that kids would go on and on about how somebody ""stole"" their gym shoes or north face bag or iPod Nano, and it drove me crazy:  *just because Stanford wants you, that doesn't mean your classmates want your fucking gym shoes*. You *lost* them. Teenagers steal overpriced clothes from the mall. Your gym shoes or ludicrously heavy bag are not worth stealing.

At my old school, when people lost shit, they lost shit, and they knew their parents would be angry and probably not replace the item. 

It's a small thing, but it drives me up the wall.

In a better world, kinks which aren't harmful are just a normal part of the broad spectrum of how human sexuality manifests. Granted, sometimes domination and submission are about internalized unequal societal gender roles, but that's certainly not a universality. 

I'm proud to be a feminist, and I have no problem with the concept of informed, consensual sexual play of all sorts, including taking someone over my knee because she's been very, very bad. As long as both (or all) parties know it's a fantasy being played out, and that it's only inside of the fantasy in which there's domination and submission, how they express themselves is no business of anyone's but theirs.

I am not promoting random hook ups at all. I'm saying that the ship has sailed on the option to place artificial barriers on intimacy once she has her first tingle powered one night stand.

Men aren't going to bail after she doesn't put out on the first or second date. If she's an interesting person, has great qualities, is pleasant to be around and leaves no room to doubt her interests, he's going to want to see her again. But, there is a fine line to walk. Don't expect him to ""love you for who you are"" before he has sex. That's all I'm trying to say.

Dabookitty,atheism,1390502084.0,"I am so sorry for you.  In my opinion and I am sure along with many people here her reaction was uncalled for and over the top.

People change over time, as do peoples beliefs.  It is unreasonable for her to assume that you would not change over time, that is just what people do.  You have had these thoughts and beliefs for quite some time and she still loved you through that.  All that has really changed is her perception of you...you are still the same person as you were the day before you told her.

As you mentioned you two have been fighting a lot...divorce was probably on her mind long before you told her your beliefs.  Don't feel bad about being truthful to her...she should respect that.  The faith issue will just be the excuse she will use if she does follow through with it.

Now ask yourself some serious questions.  Do you still love her?  How often does faith come up in your everyday lives?  Do you believe you two can come to a comprimise? 

Also make a list of things you still have in common.  What morals do you both share?  What do you agree on when raising children?  Are you okay with them being baptised and going to church?  Is she okay if they children decide they do not want to go to church?  Ask her what she would do if your son came out an atheist or gay(Or both) later in life?(Might want to get that recorded depending on the answer...could be handy in a custody dispute).

Be prepaired to lawyer up soon to protect yourself and your rights as a parent.  Suggest couples councilling.  Do what ever it takes to try to work it out.  If it works and you both are happy that would be fantastic, if not at least you can say you gave it your all.  Also it looks really good on you for trying if you do separate and custody issues begin.

My wife is also Christian, but I am lucky that she is not crazy religious.  We both started the relationship knowing where we both stood in regards to faith.

We found we are very similar(and in turn I am a better Christian in theory then her whole family practices).  We laid out rules very early on...Children will be baptized(pointless ritual for the grandparents).  They will go with her to Church but if they do not want to go we will not force them.  Told her parents religious instruction is to be left up to us...and if they utter 1 word about Daddy going to hell because he is not a Christian...they will be cut off from their grandchildren until they are old enough to make decisions for themselves(Thankfully I doubt this will ever be an issue as they have really mellowed out in the past couple of years).  We both have agreed as long as our children are happy and healthy it does not matter what religion they believe in(though preferrably not JW, Mormon, Muslim).  

My wife still goes to church every Sunday, but is eager to go with me to other events.  She had fun last Halloween at the Witches Ball held by our local Pagan community.

We are currently expecting again...and with luck/blessings/fate/divine intervention we will finally be able to enjoy parenthood."

&gt; Ideally, they would support not only democracy, but a culture of politics and journalism where policies were presented in a way that is actually informative.

I made my point inaccurate. I think a scene in *Sunshine* by Danny Boyle sums it up better than me; the astronauts in the film encounter a problem with multiple possible solutions, but cannot agree and decide to take a vote. One character chastises the group by claiming that they are not a democracy, but a round table of scientists with smart minds who should know better than to leave important decisions to groupthink.

That is to say, if democracies disallowed bullshit arguments, very few things are left to argue over. I am not for any side, nor did I intend to make it seem like anyone would want to undo a democracy. I only what it would look like if politicians were only allowed to use facts.

Most conservatives I know do not have a problem with sex ed.  There IS an issue about whether or not we should be teaching 5th graders about fisting and similar questions regarding age appropriateness.

Access to contraceptives is EASY in this day and age.

If you become pregnant and you don't have a job...you will qualify for all kinds of help.

Pro-lifers aren't trying to take that away.

There are pro-life groups that will help a pregnant woman through the entire experience.

&gt;There is a reason why countries like Belgium and Switzerland have extremely low abortion rates

They are small countries with homogenous populations.  Abortions in the USA are happening dispoportionately in black and latina communities.

So...how do we solve the problem?  What's your prescription?  Because I don't know.

thunderburd,FeMRADebates,1390502727.0,"But is that actually true?  Studies have shown that when women run for political office they win just as frequently as their male counterparts (I apologize for not having easy access to a citation at the moment).  And considering the sheer number of men at the very bottom of western society (homeless) who have NO power whatsoever it sure seems like we're only looking at a very small chunk of the population and making sweeping conclusions about the rest.

To me, patriarchy (at least in the way you are explaining the term) is like saying ""black men have an easier time gaining power and they have more power than anyone else.  Just look at Barrack Obama; he's the most powerful person in the U.S., so black men have the most influence and advantage""  When you define the sample to be ""the people in power that prove my point"" while ignoring the much larger portion of the ones that don't.

I DO think there are social pressures placed on men that encourage them to be ambitious, and there are no such social pressures on women.  This can be viewed in two ways: 

* an advantage to men (they are expected to pursue power and are thus encouraged to be ambitious) and a disadvantage to women (they are not pushed as hard, so they aren't as ambitious as a group)
* an advantage to women (they are not forcefully pushed in one direction with undue pressure and have much more freedom in their choices) and disadvantage to men (they are pressured into limited roles and punished for making the same choices a women might be able to make without facing judgment).

I tend to think that more men are harmed by that social system than helped, and the term ""patriarchy"" implies that most men are actually helped by such a system.

Edit to clarify a thought: ""men being encouraged to be ambitious"" does not make the pursuit of power ""easier"" for them (it just means the men have pressure to at least TRY to be ambitious.  It's just as difficult to gain power for men as it is women.  I do not know for sure if women are/are not actively being *discouraged* from pursuing power (if they ARE, it would invalidate the following belief), but *I* believe it is more a case of ""women have many more valid choices, so they don't choose to pursue power as frequently""."

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1390502736.0,"If the behavior is unusual, you can stop it for the time being, and continue to see a counselor and improve communication, but ultimately you have to assess whether or not he will ever be OK with it.  It seems clear that you feel being poly is who you are, and you're not willing to go back.  

He's been trying to control you, but you're trying to control him too (make him OK with being poly).  If you both realize that there's a fundamental difference, well, that's what breaks otherwise great couples up.  It's really sad, but the same things can happen over wanting to have kids or not, relocation, etc.  I love being open and so does my husband, but if either one of us decided we wanted to back to monogamy, we could do that without much difficulty.  If you're going to be miserable NOT being poly, and he's going to be miserable BEING poly...there's not a lot of options there.

But first get your communication to a healthier place while you put poly on the backburner for a little bit to see if this can work out."

Looking at the facts, it's obvious that it is alive, and also that  there is literally no way that a fetus could be anything other than a human being.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390503263.0,"You sound like you're really emotionally honest with yourself, which is awesome.  You really have my sympathy - dealing with your condition sounds really awful.

It's hard to gauge how you'd respond to polyamory - or open relationships - until you try it.  I have an open marriage, which was triggered by the fact that a) my husband is bisexual and b) i'm kind of a slut.  We started with MMF threesomes so he could get some of his sexual needs met and I could fool around with new guys, but I didn't enjoy the awkwardness much, so we decided to go open.  There were a few bumps but on the whole it's been smooth.  But for us we are open to the other having sexual experiences with other, but we uncomfortable with romantic relationships outside the marriage.  We have come to a level where we experience very little sexual jealousy, but we'd still have a lot of emotional jealousy over the idea of being replaced, romantically, so that's why we're not poly.

I share this boring anecdote with you not to be all ""me me me"" but to bring up this point: I grieved when I realized that, while my husband would be OK with being mono, he had strong sexual desires that I just couldn't meet, because I'm a woman.  Strapping it on is fun but doesn't change the fact that I'm not a man.  There's still a part of me that wishes I could fulfill ALL his sexual desires, but I've become really comfortable with that and it doesn't bother me anymore.

I'm sure you will always grieve not being able to be sexually available to someone you love, but you might find yourself able to be comfortable with an open scenario some day.  You might not be strong enough now, but I'd leave the option open, and consider checking out your local poly or non-monogamous ""scene"" via meetups or OKCupid just to get a feel for what's out there.  

Good luck.  Your emotional honesty and maturity I think will go a long way in being able to create a situation where you can find a person (or persons!) that you can connect with in unique and awesome ways."

A lot of rappers are a lot more known in the US, so it's not entirely unplausable to assume chicken-oriental may may be European and didn't hear about him before. Macklemore on the other hand is known all over Europe, *as well* as the US. 
The link above, although in German, should help demonstrating that. You can see chart positions in Germany, Austria, Swiss, UK and US, and most of his albums(as well as singles, if you scroll down a bit) rank higher constantly in the US.

Speaking from my admittedly rather limited experience about rap in Germany, german rappers will get chart hits/public exposure a lot more often than American ones(although they're so much worse, IMO)."

Also please do not presume to tell me what I do and do not know, or what I want. Your red pill nonsense might wash with your buddies, but it's not going to fly with me. 

Men and women weigh their options in marriage too. That's why we have divorce. I don't think remaining in an unhappy marriage for the sake of children is a good idea. I think it teaches them terrible lessons about what an adult relationship is. Similarly, remaining in an unhappy marriage because you fear the financial burden of raising your kids and keeping your ex wife in the style to which she has become accustomed- but I suppose that's what happens when you deliberately set about to attract women who value wealth and status highly- is a recipe for misery. 

If your marriage went sour, I am genuinely sorry- but wearing your victim t-shirt like some kind of badge of honour isn't going to help you gain the perspective you need. Your bitterness is only damaging yourself. It's sad that you're unable to see yourself as more than what you earn and who you impress- but only you have the ability to change that. 

I'm fortunate enough to live in a society that mandates paid parental leave. Technically, no financial leaning necessary. Yes, I think raising a child requires a lot of support, but the financial aspect of it is a small one. 

People tend to hook up within their own social status, because they move in the same social circles and meet the same people.

When I first started studying Law, I was expecting a course that would perhaps increase my understanding of public policy, an interest of mine. After spending several months studying it, my mind has been changed - I find the case by case dynamic of law incredibly interesting, as well as the treatment of claimant and defendant in court, both socially and technically. It's a subject that I absolutely love and have chosen to pursue a degree in at university. English Language is a close second, as I greatly enjoy the subject and adore writing stories - I'm a frequent poster on many creative writing sites.

Shortly after I started Year 12, I attended Oxford University (Hertford College mainly) on an open day with a few other students from my school. The site was stunning, reminding me of an old but grand castle or even Hogwarts from Harry Potter, and I loved every second there. The lecturers were intelligent, friendly, and incredibly interesting people who I feel truly represent what Oxford University is about - academic inquiry and excellence, the lecturer on Politics being a particularly good example of this. Ever since, studying at the university has been a goal of mine, and I am very soon applying for a two-day Law course at the encouragement of my teacher to learn more about the university and life there.

Outside of school, I enjoy playing the acoustic guitar and working with computers, as well as writing and reading. I began learning guitar at 12, and managed to achieve a Grade 5, but have not since taken any exams so I could instead learn more complex songs, like those by my musical idol, Sungha Jung. I've enjoyed computer work since Computer Aided Design in previous years. Computing is a valuable skill and I even partook in building my own PC, with plans to learn programming soon. Writing is a passion of mine, and my own is commended by my teachers and peers alike."

And even if she's not pregnant, studies have shown that women of childbearing age who are sexually active should take a prenatal that contains folate in case of unexpected pregnancy, because neural tube development in the fetus occurs before you would show a positive pregnancy test. 

If she actually is pregnant, while having a birthing plan is important (does she want meds, a water birth, home birth, etc) it will be important for her to not get too wrapped up in the plan. Very rarely does everything go as planned and some women get so dead set on the plan that when things change (think emergency c-section) they have a hard time coming to terms with it and can end up depressed or feeling guilty. Just remember that the best birth plan is the one that helps your baby to arrive safely. I had a c-section because we knew from the ultrasounds that our daughter was going to be big and she wasn't decending like she should, and it gave me peace of mind just to know that we were doing what was best for our daughter, even though it wasn't exactly what we had planned."

If you see someone passed out drunk on a scooter, you would probably see that same person passed out drunk in a car.  It isn't the mode of transportation, but the person using it.  Also, I would put done cold hard cash (not much though as I am not a rich man) that if you sat at the busiest intersection in Evansville for a day you would not see one scooterist texting, but would see dozens of car/truck drivers texting or worse.

Ok, don't want to rant-y, but I do support education courses and registration of vehicles as a minimum.  A smarter rider is a better rider, and I support registration to ensure vehicles aren't stolen.

Liberalism is a set of ideals based on the idea that the all members of a society should have access to basic resources like food and healthcare, equality of rights and privileges, and equal social mobility. Progressivism is not really an ideal, but rather a method for creating policy based on trying new things and experimenting with solutions to problems before they become problems - see The New Deal. You can be Progressive without being Liberal, and you can be Liberal without being Progressive. The Democratic Party in America is considered to be Progressive as well as Liberal, but a great deal of their policy decisions as well as their more mainstream candidates (including Presidents Clinton and Obama) are more reactionary (or Conservative) than Progressive parties of other Western nations, or indeed the Democratic Party of Franklin Roosevelt.

If she's single and wants to hang out, I don't really see an issue in that, but I'd be sure to communicate every so often about how things may be progressing and how she's feeling.  Just let it happen.  If it does, then good for you. If it doesn't you're right back where you started.  

Be sure to keep yourself in check and not get too far ahead of yourself.  If she keeps saying that she needs time for herself, then you back off and let her take the reigns for a little. If she keeps contact and you see she wants you around, then it's worth your patience to let her do what she has to do."

Well, for one, there's no chemistry or spark on my part. While he is a good looking guy, he's tall and skinny and I like more muscular dense guys. Nothing against him, just a personal preference. I've never been with him and gotten the butterflies and the anxious anticipation like I do when I'm interested in someone. It's not really something I can force. Friends introduced us, exactly how I've met guys I end up liking or dating, but there was just nothing there for me.

As for compatible, he's a pretty anxious, high-strung person. I personally am pretty calm and relaxed about most things and it bothers me when people cannot calm down. He stresses me out sometimes lol. That I'm fine with as a friend (my best girl friend is also similar, haha) but that would drive me nuts as a girlfriend.

He's also a little too nice for me. It's hard to explain but I don't like feeling like I have all the power in the relationship. I say how I feel and am willing to tell someone if I don't want to do something. He wouldn't. He would probably do anything I want him to and that's out of balance. I've been in a relationship like that and I wasn't happy. I like a guy who's willing to tell me straight and not agree with me all the time.

Do I think he's an awesome person? Of course. He is sweet, caring and 100% reliable/trustworthy. Do I think he will make some girl really happy and really lucky? Yes. That girl is just not me.

Does that clarify some?

This, at least, is the only approach that would make sense to me. There isn't really a lot of reason to ridicule his daughter solely because she thinks something is cute, is there? Maybe I'm misinterpreting this whole thing, but having thought about it, there doesn't really seem to be a lot room for interpretation. I'm open to anything you have to say, though. Maybe I'm really just plain wrong.

Regarding the elementary-school-aged students having sex: Is there are really big amount of these children having sex, or is it just some isolated cases? I tried googling, but didn't really find anything of substance /:

I found [this](http://chartsbin.com/view/xxj), stating that the average age for first-timers is higher in the US than in my own country(Germany) and a lot of Europe.

I see more of a problem with your sex education(especially in the Bible Belt) than with some young girls wearing short shorts, honestly.

The greatness of Booker T Washington is of no relevance when considering jokes involving him and peanut butter, or any food. By making Washington culinary jokes a taboo, you are only increasing the social power of such Peanut Booker jokes.

jrock954,PoliticalDiscussion,1390505368.0,"Socialism as defined by the American Democratic Socialist Party would be a good place to start, I think. In my opinion, the Tea Party isn't all that extreme, they're just a more populist movement within the Republican party. A lot of people in this thread have suggested that Democrats in the vein of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are to the Left as the Tea Party is to the Right, and I would have to agree. Both ""groups"" (I don't feel that there is currently a cohesive populist group on the Left) remain true to the core, populist principles of their party. The Tea Party seems a little more ideologically combative, but that may only be a function of their size compared to the ""extreme"" Left, and not a difference in their actual political temperaments. From what I can see, the ""extreme"" Left doesn't really differ much in terms of liberalism, but rather progressivism; no Democrat would campaign *against* abortion or gay marriage, but their policy-making can still be reactionary, like trying to ban certain types of weapons after mass shootings."

schwann,taiwan,1390505470.0,"There are plenty of reasons for not wanting to teach English in Asia.

As a long term prospect, teaching English as a second language looks horrendous on the resume. The real reason to avoid it is the extremely high opportunity cost. Your time is tied up for mediocre pay (40,000 NTD isn't that much), and you will have a hard time finding/participating in/funding more lucrative opportunities. If you decide you're sick of ESL and want out, companies will take one look at a resume with a few years worth of English teaching and throw it out.

Even if your pay happened to be on the high end of the English teaching spectrum, it won't pay enough over a lifetime to fund a retirement. The exceptions are if you start your own cram school and actually have it be successful (way less opportunity for this than before with much higher risk), or if you happen to be at the far right of the curve in the 4th standard deviation of pay scales. By definition, most English teachers in Asia are not, and will never reach that pay grade. And even if you are on the high end, at best you are looking at a middle class retirement."

Gl33m,childfree,1390505599.0,"Yeah, you're a teacher. We get it. You see hundreds of kids every year. The big issue is the fact that, for most kids, this is something you likely won't reach them on. Let's look at religion. The two are relatively comparable, in that the beliefs of the parents are pressed to the kids from the beginning, and the parents typically continue to press that belief onto the kid. But there are lots of different religions out there to be exposed to. There are lots of groups who look at religion in a myriad of ways. There's a large shift in society at this point that says you're *expected* to challenge and question what your parents taught you about the ""right"" religion. Or maybe don't be religious at all, that's also fine. At college (and even in high school) you explore all these things. But there's a place in society for that.

When it comes to the idea of child free, and that you can choose whether or not to have children, as opposed to you're just going to have them some day, isn't widespread. What's considered ""free thinking"" in society on the subject still isn't that you can choose whether or not to have them. It's that you can choose *when* to have them. Most of society thinks children are still inevitable for everyone who doesn't have a medical condition, and just choosing not to have them because you don't want to is unthinkable.

I'm not trying to belittle your influence in the youth of today's lives. I'm saying that you're trying to open them to something that society in general says you shouldn't, or that what your saying can be is crazy. Is it possible for you to do it? Sure. But your success rate will still be abysmal.

So, to restate the argument here... You don't have to have children to influence the next generation. No, not at all. But influencing them on *this subject* is really damn hard."

In other words, this statistic means absolutely nothing relevant to the discussion.

I had not considered this, and I will definitely reflect on it.  This is similar to how men only fight in family court when they have an unusually fair chance of winning.  Thanks for giving me a new perspective to consider.

&gt; Barack Obama is one person

Exactly.  And you are doing the same thing by ignoring the overwhelming majority of men at the very bottom of society who have utterly no voice and no power so you can focus on the sample that proves your point.  I can say ""there are overwhelmingly more black people than other ethnicities at the *very* top, since 1 &gt; 0"" by defining my sample size to be ""the people who have the most power by being President"".  Or I can look at the whole population and power dynamic and come to a different, and probably more accurate conclusion.  Looking only at elected individuals further ignores the polical power that womens' groups hold.  Feminist groups DO hold a good amount of political sway, and that power is often overlooked in discussions of patriarchy.  Men don't really have an analog to that power, which is one reason why the MHRM began in the first place.

Where we agree (I believe) is that the current power dynamic is probably caused by gender roles, which are harmful and should be dismantled.  I simply hate the term ""patriarchy"" because it is more often than not misused in an abrasive and abusive way, it does not accurately capture the different forms of power, privilege, and advantages/disadvantages that each gender might possess, and I can't see why anyone would choose it over a seemingly more accurate term (like Kyriarchy or even ""gender-binary"")."

* **1)** You and I are in the minority. Very few players give a hoot about these kinds of changes - so writing them up is just a waste of time.  

* **2)** The actual devs aren't the ones who write up patch notes in 9/10 games. Its usually some non-techie in the company who asks ""whats new"" - and a dev gives an ELI5. Which is why you get non-technical patch notes, its not worth the dev's time to explain it to the intern / GM who can barely complete a UDL, never mind understand what changes you made to it programatically.

Pure attack form (shriek).  Enters stealth mode automatically when not attacking; high single target damage; is squishier than a frail kitten

SentientBagOfWater,AskMen,1390506014.0,"I think it really is this simple.  Objective evidence in the form of no women being attracted.

I'm sure that there are some cases of men who do attract women and are totally oblivious to it.  This might be because the signs of that attraction are subtle, or because the men are not socially calibrated to those signs, or because they have other mental processes such as depression causing them to misinterpret those signs.

When it comes down to it though, if you're living your life in what seems to be a normal way but don't receive unprompted attention from women and don't receive positive responses to your advances towards them I'm not sure how else you can interpret the situation.  It might be a nice fiction to believe that there are countless ladies whose eye you have caught but you just didn't notice, but I would argue that especially as you start to move through your teens and early 20s you're actually more likely to misinterpret in the opposite direction, to see attraction in the mildest of compliments or friendly approaches.  This is why we have ladies here saying they are worried about giving a man a friendly compliment - because if he is starved for these things he is likely to see them as romantic or sexual interest.

Add in even one or two especially spiteful rejections of your attention (even if they are not particularly personal attacks on you), a bit of ""just man up, everyone can attract *someone*"" advice, and ""I don't attract women"" easily turns into ""I will never attract women""."

wordswench,relationships,1390506283.0,"OK, you're getting lots of advice about how horrible he is. I agree that he is disrespectful and horrifyingly rapey, but I am assuming you wanted some practical advice about talking to him about it, so here it is. This is coming from a girl in a relationship longer than yours, around the same age. 

1. Frame the issue as one of respect. Does he respect what you want? If you clearly tell him what you want, does asking again continue respecting it? Try to put him in your shoes - what if he didn't want to go to X event, but you kept badgering him until he went, and had a bad time? Would that be respectful of you?

2. If he doesn't change his behavior, react HARSHLY. If he asks and you say no and he continues, remove yourself! Go to bed, sleep somewhere else, leave the situation. Indicate that his behavior isn't OK. Because he's getting what he wants (sad rapey one-sided sex, apparently) he thinks what he's doing is OK. Show him it's not, if he won't plain old believe it's not.

3. If he refuses to understand or change his behavior, I think it's time to reevaluate. I mean, frankly, I think it's ALREADY time to reevaluate. Not only because his behavior is awful, but because by refusing to understand that you need him to respect your opinion and your desires, he's betraying the fact that he doesn't respect you.

Good luck."

Basically, if you have to be told that you're being shit tested, you've already failed. Women have at best barely veiled contempt for men they deem unattractive.

The expectation to treat women as if they are all princesses incapable of negative human behaviors is just an efficient, society spanning, shit test to maximize the effectiveness of their hypergamy. Jerks don't get the girls because they're jerks. They get the girls because they call them on their bullshit and aren't afraid to tell her to hit the road when she misbehaves.

e: accidentally a word

also, add quote:

&gt; The guy with the capacity to call a woman’s bluff with a confidence that implies she is to be worthy of him rather than the other way around is the Man to be competed for. Essentially the ‘chick speak’, ‘chick advice’ phenomenon is a shit test writ large on a social scale. And even your own mother and sisters are in on it, expecting you to ‘get it’; to get the message and see the challenge for what it really is, without overtly telling you.

&gt; She want’s you to ‘get it’ on your own, without having to be told how. That initiative and the experience needed to have had developed it makes you a Man worth competing for. Women despise a man who needs to be told to be dominant. Overtly relating this to a guy entirely defeats his credibility as a genuinely dominant male. The guy she wants to fuck is dominant because that’s ‘the way he is’ instead of who she had to tell him to be.

&gt; Observing the process will change it. This is the root function of every shit test ever devised by a woman. If masculinity has to be explained to a man, he’s not the man for her.

cluberti,sysadmin,1390506558.0,"Using one port makes monitoring easier, so it may make security easier to implement if someone is tailing the logs regularly and watching for any suspicious behavior.  If they're not, though, it's additional work that will affect the netlogon and client RPC behavior, and is unnecessary.  Microsoft recommends this practice be avoided unless *absolutely necessary*, so unless your security folks can provide good reasoning other than ""it makes things easier for us"", I don't believe this is something you should want to attempt.  If you're going to restrict traffic through the firewall simply to minimize port usage, consider IPSec instead (2 ports for everything).  It adds security to the transactions between IPSec hosts as well, as a benefit.

One of the main reasons America left Iraq wasn't because of the awkward or unjustifiable pretexts that they went to war there in the first place-- it was ""bring the boys home and who gives a shit about the Iraqis"".

If you start a war, you finish it. This shit with Kerry saying ISIS is an ""Iraqi problem now"" in Anbar, despite the fact that one of the lies they sold to the public in '03 was ""Saddam is harbouring Al Qaeda""-- now Al Qaeda is there, has been there, and America's not doing anything about it, even though they went to war in the first place to get rid of Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda-affiliated groups.

The Iraqi Army can easily handle it by itself, at this point-- it's just hilarious how the US government acted when the Iraqis said ""your enemy Al Qaeda is right here""."

What I'm saying, ""It's extremely hard for CFers to influence the view of children on the subject of having children themselves, as the predominant source of understanding kids have of this is from their immediate family. Constant comments like, ""When you have kids one day..."" coupled with blatant statements of expectation that the kids will one day also have kids themselves and that is just how it is are very difficult to impossible to overcome, especially because that is also the same view society as a whole has.""

What you keep hearing and arguing against, ""Only parents can teach children anything. Other people like teachers have no real influence over a child's life. Rabble rabble rabble.""

I hate the arguments. This will keep going too. I'll keep telling you I think you're right. That educators do have a hand in influencing children and changing their lives. They absolutely do. But you won't hear that. Because I still say it's also unlikely for you to really reach a kid on this one subject, in spite of all the influence you have, because you're still just one influence of many. Even if you went out of your way to educate kids on how having children is a choice, not an expectation, there is so much other influence working counter to you. And some of those influences are even other educators. Yeah, you'll probably reach a few... But that's it. It doesn't mean no one should try either..."

Employees of the government have extremely broad protection if they can reasonably claim they were acting within the responsibilities of the job.  The department will settle out of court, admitting no wrong-doing and pay off the victim using his own tax dollars.

However, there is a solution in the US, if people are willing to use it.  Any civil rights violation by the police in the US is a violation of 
U.S. Code › Title 18 › Part I › Chapter 13, section 242.  TL;DR:  It's a federal crime, so the US Department of Justice can intervene.

I would like to see this used consistently for every allegation of police abuse.  (I think LA had this for a while as a result of persistent abuse and racism, and things improved there.)

Local prosecutors have the authority to make a case under local, state or federal laws, but they can also *decline* to prosecute any case.  It's called prosecutorial discretion.  And we shouldn't fault them for using it when the prosecution could end the prosecutor's own career.

1. his credit is probably trashed 
2. he's made the kind of decisions in the past that have landed him here.

As for the first point, you don't know what his financial plans are. Have you talked to him at all about his situation? Maybe he's got a plan to pay down the debt and get his credit back up. Or maybe he's going to keep running from it and only paying what he's absolutely forced to. Talk to him, try and subtly broach the subject, and see what's going on.

As for the second point, what were the decisions he made to get himself buried so deep? Does he realize, now, where he went wrong? THAT he went wrong? Or is he just a terrible money manager? Without that kind of information, you really have no idea what you would be getting into if you were to pursue a relationship.

Also, just to put it out there, there is no guarantee that a relationship will lead to marriage. Why avoid a potentially rewarding relationship just because you don't want to take it to the hypothetical ""next step?""

If you really like him as much as you say you do, put in some time and figure out what's really going on with him financially. Personally, I wouldn't be so quick to ditch a great guy (with whom the sex is mind-blowing) just because he's in a lot of debt.

Malavai,TwoXChromosomes,1390507181.0,"Phobias can ""spread"" to other somewhat related things. In the case of tokophobia, perhaps a fear of doctor's offices, other pregnant women, semen, etc. Of course, it'd be different for everyone. 

A phobia doesn't have to disrupt your life every day in order for it to be ""disruptive."" I personally have a phobia of needles. They're not something I see every day, but it does ""disrupt"" some parts of my life. Some are very, very minor inconveniences - I'm afraid to eat seafood (tangential link) and I will probably never have my ears pierced. These don't really affect my quality of life. But other things *are* extremely disruptive - I have concealed injuries from friends and family, because I knew they'd make me go to the hospital and get stitches. If I'm ever seriously sick, I will probably not seek treatment. Someday, this phobia might actually *kill* me. 

Anyways, I agree that while many women are afraid of being pregnant, very few qualify as tokophobic. That's why phobias are an anxiety disorder - sufferers take that fear to more extreme levels than most people do. Phobias are not a reasonable level of fear! "

In fact, I assume if you call me faggot, that you're not thinking ""Oh, being gay is bad,"" you just want to insult me. It's just in the way that insults work that it is assumed (without thinking) that we don't want to be whatever the person is calling you. That what we're being called is a bad thing. When we insult someone, we *intend* to offend someone. And we do that by using an offensive word. One that we don't want to be called. So if you use ""faggot"" as an insult, it *is* in your head that it is bad, *but you're not consciously thinking about it.*

I don't know where the hell this idea of ""Words just don't mean anything, just don't be offended by them and everything will be fine,"" it's absolute insanity. Words are representing the ideas behind them, and we like and dislike certain ideas. There are words and combinations of words that offend everybody, even you. That's an indisputable fact. Sure, recipients can not be offended by words if they just *aren't* offended by them, that'd be nice but incredibly difficult. But then you'd still have the insult user actively trying to make a word offensive by using it as an insult, i.e. to mean something bad."

There were a few good things in there but my eyes glazed over as I kept scrolling, and scrolling, and scrolling. It was never ending.

From the bottom up - 

Message me if:  Delete everything. Keep this:

&gt;If you wanna go people watching one day, somewhere we can't be seen and throw small popcorn pieces at those unsuspecting.

and this:

&gt;And if you love olives and understand the fact that me hating them means something.

They are quirky, revealing, and inviting. That's all you need here.

Private thing is great. Way to go!

Thinking about:  Keep the three most positive ones. Lose the rest.

Six things:  Lose the 7th

Favorites: Three in each category is more than enough. 

First things:  way too negative. Umm...how about your American accent, considering you are a Yank living in England. You don't need to be so serious and deep about everything.

Really good at:  keep the three most positive

Doing with my life:  you come across as directionless. Keep it simple and upbeat. ""I'm in my ___ year of a ___ year stint in the Air Force. After my enlistment ends, I'll go back to school and finish my degree in _________. 
I spend my off duty time doing _____________.""

Even if you aren't sure you will finish your degree, there's no need to advertise that on a profile. That conversation can wait until an actual relationship develops.

Self-summary. The biggest elephant in the room is your transient situation. You are an American in England with the military. Will you be there a year, two years, forever? Girls will be hesitant to see you as a long term prospect if you do not address that. 

Pictures:  You have two in the car selfies. Keep the smiling one. Lose the one you have as your main. Lose the picture with the much taller friend. Your details lays out your height, no need to emphasize it with a picture. Maybe add a picture in uniform. Bitches love uniforms. (at least American bitches do, not sure about European ones)

Play up the fact you are an American living abroad. Right now (aside from being cute) it's the best thing you have going for you.

No.  It doesn't.  You can still get a prescription if needed and buy the birth control for yourself.  Most forms are reasonably priced.

No one is saying you can't take birth control...they are just saying, ""We will not pay for it.""

&gt;The Republicans seem to feel that birth control should be available only if your employer thinks it might be okay.

More like...I think that if I go to work for the Archdioscese of someplace and they have never paid for my birth control because they object to it... I don't suddenly have a right to demand that they pay for my birth control.

kornberg,relationship_advice,1390507658.0,"So I am guessing that you've never been in a happy relationship where you cohabitated.

Sometimes, your partner does shit that is fucking annoying. They don't do it on purpose, it's just shit that doesn't bother them like it bothers you. It could be something like leaving the cap off the toothpaste or putting the milk on the door instead of on the shelf or any number of stupid annoying shit. But you also have stupid, annoying habits. You leave crumbs in the butter and don't dry off before stepping on the bathmat or whatever stupid thing you do that happens to annoy the other person you live with. You don't even realize you are doing something that is totally obnoxious to someone else because to you, it's not a big deal.

So, could get mad at my husband for not putting his towels in the hamper or for walking past the trash/recycling and putting his Diet Coke cans on the counter next to the sink. We'd fight about it all the time, I'd be pissed off at him constantly and these stupid issues would be a bone of contention in our marriage. 

**Or** I could just take the 3 seconds it takes to toss his shit in the hamper or the cans in recycling and go about my day, just as he puts the cap back on the toothpaste and avoids the butter crumbs. It's not worth arguing over--neither of us are going to change because the stupid, annoying habits we have are not important enough to us to notice. Sure, if I know something bugs him, I'll make an effort and vice versa but it's ridiculous to fight over that shit. We love each other and want to be happy together and that goal is worth overlooking bullshit like that. "

If you used Datacenter licensing to cover that host, however, you may indeed be good to go for Windows clients on that box.  Other apps like Office are licensed differently when accessed over terminal services/RDP connectivity (which VDI falls under), and so you may need to look at TS CALs as well.  Ultimately, you want to ask your rep about VDA licensing and Office licensing (if you run Office) in a VDI environment.  Plus, VDA licenses actually cover more than just the OS and access to it, so it may be worth looking into all of the things you do get with a VDA license for your VDI instances anyway."

Our minds do the rational thing of searching for patterns and trends to explain our realities.

Furthermore, there exists the unfortunate reality of children being exposed to all manner of debilitating physical and psychological events. No, they were not their fault. It is unfortunate that a child is involved in an auto accident that paralyses them from the chest down, but that child has been removed from the pool of future prospective mates nonetheless.

It is not, in any way, morally wrong to opt out of involving oneself with a potential mate who by no fault of their own could be seen as unfit.

superspeck,sysadmin,1390508371.0,"Whoah. Dude. Yeah, you need to make a change. 

And I don't mean the nerd uniform; that's pretty much expected. 

And let me be clear that it's not just my job that's a stressor. I have too much going on in my personal life. Completing renovation of a house I bought when I was single and putting it on the market -- and it's not worth the money for me to pay someone to do the work most of the time, so I need to do it myself at night. There's a lot of decisions you have to make when you are doing IT work, and lots of decisions that you have to make when you're doing renovation work. You an only make so many good decisions in a day before you're mentally exhausted, and then you need some time off from making decisions. You'll subconsciously fix some of them, but not all of them. 

Two things I'm doing is outsourcing certain things to other family members -- having my fiancée clothes shop for me and having my mother figure out what materials I need and in what order to finish my renovation job. That way I can focus on the home improvement work, which actually gives me a sense of satisfaction. Also, I'm delaying as many other decisions as I can. I've set up 'save spots' in the future (e.g. when I stage my house to sell I'll move into an apartment with my fiancée) so that I don't have to plan out beyond that horizon and can focus on immediate needs and immediate relaxation. 

In your situation, I think you've got two choices to recover enough so that you interview well. You can either: a) pay to outsource all of the menial tasks that you're doing (unless you're like me and you are fortunate to have a very durable and understanding fiancée) -- such as signing up for a laundry pickup/delivery service, having someone else mow your lawn if you have one, hire a maid, so on and so forth ... spend the time you would have spent on those tasks on things that light your fire, or b) you can reduce your expenses to the bone and eat ReadyMac for a couple months while you save up, and then quit your job and go on vacation or a creative sabbatical for a month or two. 

The thing is, if you go into an interview looking like you're jacked up on caffeine, haven't slept in a month, and are barely coherent, you probably aren't going to show well. You'll need to be able to go into an interview relaxed, confident, and able to tell coherent stories about what you have done before and intend to do in the future with your skills. Your inability to write a decent cover letter says you can't tell stories coherently right now. 

Regarding your immediate problems with caffeine deprivation -- I was a big fan of NoDoz in college. It's basically caffeine in pill form. Not a good thing for your heart and filter organs in the long term, but it might help you with the soda ban. Any form of stimulant will help increase cognitive function, but like you, I need the strong stuff. 

This is definitely a first world problem. It's one that doesn't receive enough attention. "

Heelincal,nfl,1390508662.0,"Regarding the second one, check your wrist orientation at release first. If it's open (i.e. ball is pointing right) you're going to have more of the outward point on the throw. Try cocking it a bit more towards your head. Also, try moving your grip back on the ball if possible. The higher up you are on the laces, the more contact your hand will have with the ball, and the friction can throw off the axis.

At least, that's why I did when I played and had the same problem. It might have been another part of my mechanics too though, so I can't guarantee that it'll help."

Even my step mom was able to pull my dad, and she was NOT a slim lady. She was actually impressively large. Of course, my dad was 22 years her senior, but he was a conventionally handsome business man.

Who wants to bet that this chick is in her early 20s and expects to have met their soul mate already? So maybe, just maybe, be patient?

keypuncher,politics,1390508775.0,"&gt; You're very confused. The first is a (very weak) article about euthanasia, which pretty much all doctors support and only nuts oppose.

Nice try at characterizing anyone who disagrees with you as a nut.

From the first article:

&gt; Therefore, we argue that, when circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible. 

&gt; The newborn and the fetus are morally equivalent

.

&gt; **The newborn and the fetus are morally equivalent**

&gt; The moral status of an infant is equivalent to that of a fetus in the sense that both lack those properties that justify the attribution of a right to life to an individual. 

.

&gt; **The fetus and the newborn are potential persons**

&gt; Although fetuses and newborns are not persons, they are potential persons because they can develop, thanks to their own biological mechanisms, those properties which will make them ‘persons’ in the sense of ‘subjects of a moral right to life’: that is, the point at which they will be able to make aims and appreciate their own life. 

Although fetuses and newborns are not persons, they are potential persons because they can develop, thanks to their own biological mechanisms, those properties which will make them ‘persons’ in the sense of ‘subjects of a moral right to life’: that is, the point at which they will be able to make aims and appreciate their own life.

Edit: Also, the commissary here often stocks expired products. We're not OCONUS or so rural that they have an excuse for that. Bread shouldn't be old and molding on the shelves, food should not be expired. It's not cool that they expect us to pay money for that.

There are many forms of communication to get a desired message across. Actions are a huge one in seduction (kino, stature, etc.), but words are direct and effective when filtering out people who aren't worth your time. Tell her you want to take her out. If she invites her friends along, tell her that that's not what you had in mind. Ask her if she has a boyfriend and tell her exactly how you feel about the answer. If she's into a certain hobby or topic that you appreciate, tell her. If she does something you don't like, tell her. Don't be fake.

America owes the Iraqi people a whole lot, especially considering their active meddling and cold-war interference starting in the 1960s-- and predominantly in regard to their aiding and abetting Saddam as he became more and more autocratic-- but the 2003 invasion was based on lies and this completely farcical pretence.

It wasn't about ""liberating the Iraqi people""-- that was, apparently, far less of a priority then getting rid of Saddam *their* way and as part of this gambit to increase regional hegemony and to make darling Israel feel safer. This last bit is particularly outstanding in how pathetic it is, and more so once you consider how involved Israel-firsters and dual-citizen ""American""-Israelis were involved in setting up the campaign.

There's no sense entering into a relationship knowing that this is just going to be a pretty big fight down the road. To be clear, this is because he's irresponsible with his finances, not because he has a lot of debt. BUT I definitely think you should be honest with him about why you don't want a relationship. If he's this chronically terrible with his money, he needs a wake up call. Maybe the realization that he's dug himself a hole so deep that it's affecting his personal relationships will help him get out of it. 

There is a way to go about it without destroying his self-esteem, though. I can't tell you exactly what to say, but I think you could make it clear that you place a lot of importance on the financial stability/responsibility of a potential partner, and he just doesn't fit the bill.

One thing I've realized, is that I'm fucking terrible at small talk. Probably because I don't much care for it (I guess I'm very to the point, and don't talk much unless I have something to say), but it makes it incredibly difficult for me to approach people. I never know what to say after introductions, and when I convince myself to try anyway, it will almost always lead to an awkward situation.

I want to keep trying, but with every failure it becomes more and more difficult. I'm not talking about getting with someone either, just being able to at least approach someone and have a good time.

Well, [here](https://sites.google.com/site/androidappcoursev3/home) are all the assignments we did. We also worked in a group to create and publish and app to the Play Store.

&gt; What do you feel benefited you the most?

The biggest benefit to me was planning and working on a non-trivial application.

&gt; What did you find out later that would have been good to know at the beginning?

Once you get the basics down just keep reading about Android on the web. There are tons of useful libraries and tutorials out there just take a bit of time to find.

Heelincal,nfl,1390510262.0,"A lot of it depends on your own style. There's no ""perfect"" way to throw it for everyone. What matters is how you're built and what you're comfortable with, just like golf. However, again like golf, there's some agreed on principles on the best ways to throw it.

What I was taught is in the ""cocked"" position (right before the forward motion begins, aka the firing position), the ball should be at about a 90-135 degree angle away from the target (away is pointed towards the right for righties and left for lefties, inward is the opposite). Personally I lean more towards 90 degrees because my arm is stronger at the ""press"" motion. Most QBs are around 100-120 from what I've seen. [Drew Brees throwing motion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngel-VlrgAk).

Definitely more like a baseball.

Although what is most important is getting an extension on your arm and locking your wrist. When the ball is moving foward at your shoulder and you begin your release, your hand should be in a C (*not* a U) around the ball. Additionally, your hand should be close to your ear - this keeps your release efficient and compact. The wider you get, like Stafford and Rivers, the more issues you'll have.

Basically:

1. Point out
2. Lock wrist
2. Compact
3. Extend
4. Drive with your point finger
5. Flick
6. Point (Pointer finger should end up pointing at target)

Hope that helps! Again, I'm not an expert, just played high school ball as a QB in a passing offense. I'm sure there are more experienced individuals on here. And remember no style is perfect. Rivers and Favre have really unorthodox styles and still can deliver the ball well."

She *knew* what she did was wrong, but she lied to him for three years straight - maybe this was a result of her condition, but a crazy murdering maniac is still punished regardless of how crazy he is. Besides, if she can lie about fucking 20+ guys and girls, she can lie about being sexually abused. I know it sounds cynical and horrible, and the rest of my reply is not based on that assumption, but it should be noted that she may just be a compulsive liar which she'd need help with anyway.

In addition, there is no guarantee that the wife will ever get better. What if this happens again? Should OP just deal with it all over again, get her some more help? No - he has a duty to himself over her. In a normal marriage without cheating, sure, you sacrifice, you put your partner first. OP's been kicked in the balls here. Whether she has a serious problem or not, she betrayed her husband and as such he is no longer bound to put her first. He should not have to suffer because of his wife's illness.

Should she get help? Yes. Is she at fault? Yes. Is she absolved of all guilt? Fuck no. OP owes her nothing, and I don't think he's duty-bound to stay with her."

keypuncher,AdviceAnimals,1390510525.0,"I've seen this go both ways.

In one case, the highest-paid employee was a fantastic salesman, responsible for over half the company's sales.  Management (owners were remote and hands-off) was jealous that with salary+commission he was earning more than they were - so they had a meeting with him and he renegotiated to be pure commission - and then increased his sales to make even more money than before.  Management then found a trumped up excuse to let him go.  Sales plummeted.

Second case was an older engineer who had been in the same job for 30+ years.  Wasn't really doing anything, just collecting a paycheck - but he'd been buddies with the boss and always got great raises.  Management changed, old engineer got fired 6 months later, wasn't replaced, and nobody really noticed a difference."

Heelincal,nfl,1390510542.0,"&gt; Growing up, they always tell you to grab as much of the laces as possible.

One of my earlier coaches was like that. Definitely gives you more control on the ball. However what I was told is basically the more contact you have with the ball (especially in your palm and lower fingers) the more your skin will spin it on release. Same thing with basketball - shooting is all about the first three fingers on your shooting hand. The ring and pink are for balance against the other hand. If your ""guide hand"" is gripping the ball too hard, you'll veer towards that side and have an odd spin on the ball.

I've got big hands (hehe) as well, and basically my coach told me to stop groping the ball haha. Try it out and see what happens. Might also be footwork, shoulders, etc. It's a very fine art!"

""Hey Candlehead!  If you put a dollar into your savings account right now, I'll pitch in 25 cents for free.  The only catch is, you can't have that $1.25 until you retire.""

Start contributing at your FIRST job, as soon as they'll let you.  22 isn't too young.  Even if you only put $100 into your 401(k) in your entire first year on the job, that will be over $3,500 by the time you're ready to retire, thanks to the miracle of compound interest.  If you wait until you're 30 to start saving, then the $100 you deposit will net you $1,800 instead.

2012 Mazdaspeed 3? 25 mpg highway isn't too bad for the HP you get. And you get a 5 door.

I guess it all depends on what you consider fun. Do you like cars? AWD is going to be more expensive than FWD. Most of the cars I would consider fun would be RWD / AWD as well. I recommend you don't get a car naturally RWD converted to AWD - usually adds cost and complexity but not really a good reason most of the time to do so.

Other alternatives: 2012 Subaru WRX (might be rare), Honda Accord V6, Toyota Camry V6, Acura TSX all come to mind. People seem to like GTIs but I get leery of German maintenance costs, especially if you are not hands-on with your fix-it work.

Real, actual violence IS viewed as an extremely negative thing in our society.  That's why the punishments and stigmas for things like murder, assault, manslaughter, etc. are greater than for nearly all other crimes.  Violence in media is not really the same thing at all.  And violence in a boxing match is completely different from criminal violence, and it's perfectly fine to value boxing as a sport, even though it is violent in nature.

It's not like there's only the sketchiest of evidence for the Qibla massacre-- this is an event that indisputably happened, and the killers were without a doubt Israelis. You have them saying as much-- mostly just lying about who it was they killed, exactly.

Following the Sunday mass, the Inquisitor would proceed to read the edict; it explained possible heresies and encouraged all the congregation to come to the tribunals of the Inquisition to ""relieve their consciences"". **They were called Edicts of Grace because all of the self-incriminated who presented themselves within a period of grace (usually ranging from thirty to forty days)** were offered the possibility of reconciliation with the Church without severe punishment.[54] The promise of benevolence was effective, and many voluntarily presented themselves to the Inquisition and were often encouraged to denounce others who had also committed offenses, informants being the Inquisition's primary source of information. After about 1500, the Edicts of Grace were replaced by the Edicts of Faith, which left out the grace period and instead encouraged the denunciation of those guilty.

Heelincal,nfl,1390511421.0,"That pretty look is usually only going to come with longer throws just so you know. The accuracy for me comes from the compact motion and where I hold the ball. Just like baseball, find the grip you like the best - there's usually a better spiral/control in the middle of the ball, but if you can stretch out more and throw more from the back, you can get the ""pretty"" look... but it's harder to do.

Rivers throw comes from how he learned to throw - with a full size ball as a young kid. He pushes the ball forward without cocking it back. It's not the traditional method, but he still has the basics in there with a bit more sidearm.

The ""pretty"" thing is seriously hard to do consistently. What I've found is the angle of the ball releasing and the distance help."

What I ""love"" about our precious tories or neo-cons or whoever, is that you guys will say ""international law is worthless"" or ""it really doesn't matter""-- but of course, only in specific situations, when you want it not to matter or to simply forget about it.

If Palestinians were seen to potentially break international law-- shooting dead some of the thugs from the Golani Brigade after capturing them, for example, the tories would be screaming about international law violations, the Israel-firsters would be absolutely hysterical and would start demanding ""Israel's right to act (more so) outside the boundaries of international laws""."

The mature and healthy thing to do would be for her to tell you she misses you when you're not there, and would rather you didn't have to travel for work, and *ASK* you if you would be willing to try to find a job that doesn't require the travel.

If you are not willing to do this (because you love your job), or are not able to do this (because the economy sucks and jobs aren't exactly just laying around waiting for people), she needs to back the fuck down and accept the situation with some grace and dignity and treat you with respect over it.

Threats are a piss poor way to try to manage a relationship."

AllwaysConfused,AskCulinary,1390511517.0,"I noticed that the recipe calls for melted butter - I personally have never seen that in a chocolate chip recipe. Softened butter but not melted. The recipes read chill the dough for an hour before baking though, so at the risk of sounding stupid, could the fact that you are essentially heating the butter twice be causing a problem? I've had the same problem with cookies before, but instead of melting the butter I just set it out for a couple hours so it was nice and soft, then chilled the dough as usual and the cookies turned out fine. I made chocolate chip cookies for Christmas and forgot to set the butter out. I melted it in 15 second bursts in the microwave, and let it cool before adding it to the mix, but the cookies still flattened, and were too brown on the bottom and not set in the centers. "

stctippr,CFB,1390511533.0,"So you're saying that if a highschool wide receiver sits down with his family to decide what school is best for him and his chances at the nfl, they're going to tell him to go to GT (7 pass completions per game) instead of a school like Oregon (19.8 per game)? Playing at GT may not necessarily hurt their chances at making a name for themselves, but I would argue it helps significantly less than a school that throws the ball on a regular basis.

Dabookitty,atheism,1390511544.0,"Define Good

Define Evil/Bad

Depending on your current situation what is good and evil will change.

The most basic descriptions I can think of for what is good and evil are:  

Good: That which promotes the continuation of Life

Evil/Bad: That which does not promote the continuation of Life.

That is the best I can do without using good or evil to define the other and without bringing in one set of morals over another.  Depending on your current situation something can be Good or Evil/Bad.  Even though for something to truely be good or evil/bad there has to be intent behind the action.

A natural disaster maybe people would label as Bad, even though there is no intent behind it.  We label it as bad because it does not support our lives.  Something like a Hurricane, Tornado, Earthquake, Fire and put us as great risk of losing our lives.

Slavery is good if it supports your way of life.  Many ancient cultures could not have existed without the use of slave labour.  It was a good thing(if you weren't a slave).  Maybe even for some slaves it was a good thing...food, water, a place to sleep.  And we all know for many many many many years it was seen as a necessary thing and since it was supported by the Bible it must be good.

People also label things as evil/bad if it does not support thier way of life.  People of opposing religions = bad.  It promotes a different way of thinking that goes against what they have been taught.  This can be very bad for those in power that require the status quo be maintained.  Any disruption to that status quo can be very very bad indeed.  

I think we can agree this is how many fundamentalists see things.  With the acceptance of same sex marriages and gays/lesbians in general, pro-choice, birth control, etc they see it as an attack on thier way of life.  So therefore Evil/Bad.

As I am sure others have mentioned...it's all relative.  Just like your taste in music.  What one person believes is good...some one else is bound to think it's evil/Bad."

Lol, the ""we didn't sign it so we're not guilty of war crimes when we commit war crimes"".

Sort of like ""we can have as many nukes as we like and still demand people cover us with praise and sycophancy because we didn't sign the non-proliferation treaty"".
