mudra311,AskMen,1389715379.0,"I doubt confidence has much to do with a preference for a female with few sexual partners. 

It's more biological where women are selective of the best men. Men like to feel wanted and special. When a woman has numerous sexual partners, they don't feel as special since she seemingly isn't choosey enough. 

Like you said, different men have different preferences. I prefer my woman to have much more dating experience and relationship experience than sexual partners. It shows that she's committed and knows how to treat a guy. 

Takes all sorts. Not to say that I can't fall for someone who doesn't meet those expectations - they're simple preferences."

rmigz,leagueoflegends,1389715459.0,"Perhaps by then Riot will realize the error of their ways in restricting professional organizations from having a team in more than one of the LCS regions.  

I don't want this to come off as a diatribe, but I believe that the Lemondogs fiasco is a scenario somewhat contributed towards by Riot in their restriction on reputable, well-organized e-Sports entities like TSM, CLG, Crs, Dignitas, EG, C9, etc. that have the financial pipeline and organizational structure to support multiple professional teams from having an EU team in addition to their NA counterpart.  I would imagine that a squad as good as Lemondogs would have been part of one of these organizations and it could have potentially offered more management stability for the players.

Maybe in Season 5, when C9 EU (Stratus) can qualify for LCS, the restrictions against having multiple teams in different regions will be lifted.  Ultimately organizations will find workarounds such as EG did with the Alliance team.  I think it's becoming fairly apparent that having an alternate brand owned by the same person (EG/Alliance) is just as profitable with limited damage to the original brand if the players are as marketable as Krepo, Snoopeh, Wickd, Yellowpete and Froggen.

Edit:  OGN serves as a perfect example as to how beneficial it can be for the players, tournament/league operators and organizations to have two teams under one organization.  The more experienced managers from the established organizations offer more to the players and most likely handle things with the tournament/league in a more efficient manner as they are battle tested in a sense.  It is also more enticing for sponsors to see stability and professionalism from established organizations they are offering financial support to."

The Prime minister is from the lower chamber, much like the current UK/Canadian/Australian system, or the leader of the US house of representatives. 

The PM can sort of veto the President, in that both need to sign off on various things for them to be legal.

When the president's party controls parliament the job of prime  minister ends up being mostly symbolic, whereas  when they are separate parties or otherwise in disagreement things break down and the president can call new  parliamentary elections.

If everything else had been equal, I have no idea whether or not I'd choose the implant over the hormonal IUD--I'd probably go with the implant just because then there's no risk of a perforation or something like that but all other things are not equal and the Mirena IUD was the best choice for me.

C9 EU or C9 NA just don't inspire the same kind of loyalty as C9 Cirrus/Nimbus and C9 Stratus.  It's more fun for the fans, I think, and it offers a more diverse merchandising opportunity for the business; which is ultimately good for the players since it will raise the potential salary ceiling to have their organization be more profitable.

I believe OGN's rules are definitely better as it relates to having multiple teams under one organization than the current LCS rule-set because it allows experienced professionals to be in charge rather than having new organizations pop up and leave more to be desired from a management perspective.

Edit:  By the way I think C9 would be perfect for this as an example in NA because of their large fan following and their propensity for merchandising (hoodies, t-shirts, wristbands, posters, etc.)"

partspace,AskWomen,1389716007.0,"This is a great and honest answer, and I am pretty much the same.

Growing up in an almost all white suburb, I used to associate black with urban, inner city, drugs, and crime. On some level, I knew that not all black people were like that, but at the same time there was this sense of danger instilled in me. Black people were on the news committing crimes. There was this unspoken rule I grew up with: Don't go into the city (where the black people are), partspace. It's dangerous. You'll get raped/mugged/murdered by a strange (black) man. Hell, when I grew up and moved into the city, the young white kids that I worked with would still be amazed that I lived in the city and could walk around without being in danger. So it's still going on today.

So there is this incredibly stupid and racist reaction in me when I see a black man walking towards me that I have to fight against. Even though I know better, I go on alert and tense up. In the next moment I remind myself to relax and that I'm being an idiot. It's going to take some time for me to completely muzzle that racist kneejerk reaction. But this racism is so incredibly deeply ingrained in us and our society, especially when we weren't really raised with any exposure to black people. I didn't have a single black person in any of my classes growing up, and no black friends.

CadHuevFacial,AskReddit,1389716103.0,"Regardless of whether or not we agree on what 'intense' emotion denotes, it appears you're still missing the point. It appears from your last response that you seem to think that strong female emotions are unwarranted unless preceded by hormonal/menstrual fluctuations (which is extremely insulting) or 'hard life' events. That response is incredibly insular and basically communicates that any emotions you personally do not experience are unworthy of your time or consideration. I am trying to stay focused on the original question which asked, ""why women are hesitant to discuss their problems/what's on their mind with their SO's"", and you are responding in the exact way that may stop most women from talking about those problems and feelings. You also keep referring to ""raging hurricanes"" of the mind and ""reasonably contextless extreme emotion"" when I am *not talking about that same level of emotion*. Even if the question refers to everyday problems and feelings that are not funeral sized, *it is common for women to have their emotions constantly dismissed as unimportant*. 

You seem to believe that intense or extreme *negative* emotions (again, I never mentioned and am not talking about extreme, uncontrollable, raging-hurricane emotions!) are not worth looking into without what you believe is a reasonable context, **even if the person feeling those emotions believes the context to be reasonable.** Emotions of the kind I'm talking about (e.g. the kind of anger felt when a SO is late for something important or forgets to pick you up) do not necessarily predicate a completely illogical and nonsensical mindset. People can be angry, sad, and/or hurt and completely within reason all at once!

I gave a perfectly valid example in my previous response, but you seemed to look over that completely. Again, it is all too common that when women decide to explain as exactly as they can *why* they are upset or what their problem is that the men in their lives *disregard the context completely* and claim their reasons for being upset are not good enough. THAT response, THAT dismissal is what prompts women to shut up the next time around. Your personal discomfort and unwillingness to accept intense displays of [negative] emotions doesn't invalidate them, and **it doesn't make them wrong.**

Why would we share anything if our problems are going to be ignored anyway? **Why talk about how we feel if our emotions are going to be made out to be unacceptably crazy and raging?**"

gazork_chumble_spuzz,xxfitness,1389716353.0,"&gt;Yeah, I know I can't change my underlying bone structure (which is a shame).

This is your first problem. You need to teach yourself to stop seeing your body as flawed, because it's not. We all have things about ourselves that we don't love, but you know what? Life is too darn short to spend your time being dissatisfied with the body that's carrying you through every day and through all the hard times you endure. Ain't nobody got time for that. 

&gt;I have wider shoulders than hips, and I feel like my hip to waist ratio isn't as extreme as I would like.

This isn't something you can really change until you start having babies - then your hips will widen! lol That's what mine did, anyway.

This is something you can fake with clothing choices. Wearing darker colours on top, in styles that don't emphasize your shoulders and have a tailored waist, paired with lighter colours on the bottom will help. I'm sure the lovely ladies of /r/femalefashionadvice would be able to help you with that. Also, find yourself a copy of [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Dress-Your-Best-Complete-Finding/dp/0307236714) - they have advice in there for balancing pretty much every shape and size and it's fabulous. 

&gt;I've been going to thew gym and lifting progressively heavier weights but I don't know if that's just going to make me look manlier (I heard that's a myth?).

Unless you're using steroids or something, you aren't going to wind up looking like a man. You will be strong and muscular but if you're lifting heavy that's probably your goal anyway.  : )   Muscular women look awesome.

&gt;What I want: 1) Wider hips 

Like I said, the only thing that I've ever found to effectively widen my hips was pregnancy. Even then, though, it wasn't super dramatic for me. After three kids I'm still not much more curvy than I was before but there was a bit of a difference. I would not recommend that as a fitness plan though. lol

2) Big butt 

This is a matter of finding the right exercise to build up your butt and hip muscles. I love love love [doing these](http://fitnesstreats.tumblr.com/post/4741330647/bam-bams-from-marc-laurens-book-you-are-your-own). I find that if I weight my ankles and do them slooooowly, holding my feet together for a slow count of 5 at the top of the arc, it isn't long before I notice a difference. My butt hasn't gotten *bigger*, but it has gotten far more perky and round and lifted looking. And that's with my half-ass lackadaisical approach to workouts that I've fallen into over the last three months (I got sick). The only other way besides exercise to grow your butt would be to eat foods that will make you put on a bit of weight, but that would make it harder for you to thin out your inner thighs.

&gt;3) Bigger boobs (but not bigger shoulders) 

In my experience, working out makes my boobs get smaller because I lose fat from the top down. Any time I get a fever, my torso thins out rapidly and I lose all the padding from my collarbones and boobs. Tragically, the cellulite from my thighs and ass never quite seems to disappear as rapidly. lol So yeah, if you're hitting the gym and getting lean and mean, one side effect will be that your boobs aren't going to grow bigger, but may in fact wind up smaller. From what I've seen that's normal for the female body. You could invest in some really great pushup bras (check out /r/ABraThatFits if you want some good suggestions, those ladies know their bras!). And there's always augmentation, if you want to go that route.

&gt;4) Smaller inner thighs

That, I don't know about! Do you want to lose some fat from that area, or is the muscle larger than you wanted? As I said before, I have never succeeded in removing the fat from my thighs and butt entirely. I've mostly just made peace with its existence because it gives me some much-needed padding so I have no experience with any special techniques that would help you here.

I think your best bet would be to work your lower body hard, and then to fake what can't be changed with clothing choices.  : )"

And really, so was I. Would he have a ""maiden"" name? How does that even work? Too complicated and too different for our taste, so scratch that.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389716853.0,"&gt;What does Canada get out of it?

Essentially nothing, as we are already reasonably friendly with Israel.

&gt;Why is this?

Pandering to conservative voters. 

&gt;Why wasn't Canada as much of an ally before?

Suez, when the Soviets threatened to nuke the UK and France over their trying to seize the Suez canal from Egypt  along  with the Israelis.  After that the UK and  France built independent nuclear arsenals, and Israel went to the  'muricans for weapons.  Indirectly Canada  helps them, and we do have friendly relations with Israel, but as a practical matter Israel needs friends who can send  weapons fast,not friends who talk a lot.

&gt;What would Israel get out of it?

Marginally more trade.  While the US has been more  forgiving of Israeli transgressions over the years than anyone else, it's not like western Europe or Canada and  Israel do not all have fairly friendly relations.  


&gt;What's all that about?

Basically copying the republican party playbook in the US.  Conservative Christians vote for pro Israeli candidates, and Stephen Harper is looking at the polls and realizing that his odds in the next election aren't as good as he would like.

kornberg,AskWomen,1389717048.0,"I would say that it's not necessarily young black guys who frighten me--it's a certain type of guy or pack of guys who I can tell do not see me as a human being. Young black guys certainly can fall into this category but any demographic of men can fall into this category. 

However, not everyone is as good at people as I am so others may be more prone to make generalizations. This young woman may have grown up in an area where there were a lot of very poor young black men. Young men tend to travel in packs and packs of young men who have nothing else going on can be very frightening for young women. Hell, my own husband traveled in such a pack, although the worst trouble they ever got up to was throwing potatoes at passing cars from an abandoned parking garage. They are bored, full of hormones and energy and have no outlet for any of it so like a dog locked in a house all day, they usually turn to destructive behavior to alleviate that boredom.

You see it a lot on both ends of the economic spectrum: poor packs have nothing to lose because they have nothing anyway and very wealthy packs know that their parents, their parents' money and their connections can and will protect them from any consequences. 

As a relatively defenseless woman, packs of young men are scary as all fuck. I'm pretty confident and am rarely in situations where I cannot get enough control to at least get out but packs of young men scare even me. 

Your friend may have had bad experiences or have been told of others' bad experiences that led her to feel nervous around young black men. The best you can do for her and for you is to prove her wrong. "

True, I don't like Bow and Arrow either, but at least those are not easily hidden in public, those are too big. And I don't see how someone could intentionally kill people with a boomerang. Sure possible, but everything you mention needs people who know what to do, needs a lot of training to intentionally hurt someone. While a gun can be easily used and even acidenially fire when carried by someone stupid. Bow and Arrow and anything else just won't do that by accident.

&gt;Gun related crimes are almost unavoidable because there will always be access to firearms (unless we live in an Orwellian society) and there will always be mentally unstable people who get excited at the prospect.

Right, and the USA is building an Orwellian society. So you would rather life in surveillance than without a gun?

The unreliable persons who can easily access guns are my biggest fear. I don't suspect someone who shoots for a hobby to shoot a person, but I never know if a stranger is some insane guy with a gun or just a hobby shooter.

Most relatively modern operating systems support IPv6 (vista and above on windows), as do most routers - but not all.  If you have a modem (cable/phone/dsl/etc.) from somewhere it will need to support IPv6, and a lot of them don't, particularly older ones.  But don't run  out and buy one, because your ISP may not have much IPV6 support yet, and they might contact you when  the time comes.  

IPV6 is really much more about your service provider than you.  You will get an IPV6 IP address when you connect to the internet, if you have a website you'll need to add DNS entries for that with whomever you buy your address from.  But if you don't own your own website how you connect to and use the  internet will be pretty much unchanged.   

The problem then, is that every piece  of hardware at every ISP needs to support IPV6 for it to become mainstream.

As a matter of fact, if I were a manager for C9, I would add performance bonuses to player contracts in the event that these sibling teams play each other and then spend some money hyping it up on social media akin to something like the [Subway Series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series) (Mets vs. Yankees) where the teams played for the *Best in New York* honorary title.

I am hardly blind to troubles.  I simply recognize that we must ensure the integrity of the vote if we are to retain a representative government.  That is something *you* appear to be blind to.

&gt; I would write something mean-spirited like how I'd hope you got thrown in prison for something you didn't do or were just adjacent to to a crime and got profiled, but that isn't really the issue here.

Been there, done that.

&gt; Some offices only have certain opening hours and when working 2-3 jobs on minimum wage those opening hours can be heart to make.

Yep.  Been there too - and yet somehow I managed to get the necessary documentation to vote - and voted, too.

&gt; Yet what really I pity you at this point is the fact that you are this adament about hating such a big part of the american experiment, the mixing of cultures to further the 1. greatness of the US and 2. increase the living standard of your family from hard work, and reading your posts is just some of the most disheartening reading I do on reddit these days..

You are mistaken, regarding hating the American experiment and in particular the mixing of cultures - I'm perfectly fine with that (though I would prefer some of the cultures in question *integrate* into American culture rather than remaining separate and insisting we adapt to them).  You are also mistaken regarding immigration raising the living standard of my family.

Specifically, illegal immigration drives down wages and increases unemployment for poor Americans - and even the CBO had to admit that Amnesty would make it worse for at least a decade.

Legal immigration does the same, but also affects the middle class.

When there is a labor shortage, or at least not a surplus, immigration is a good thing - but that is not the situation we are in right now.  Over a third of our working age population is unemployed, and less than half have full time jobs.  Until that improves, additional immigration will only make it worse.

&gt; I truely hope the best for America, but it appears to me as long as poor republicans wont get their heads out of their asses it's going to be shit for everyone but the top 40%.

A lot of working class people vote Republican because the Democrats are against everything they believe in.  That said, the Tea Party is gaining popularity among those same people because they recognize that neither party really represents them and their values.

As to being shit for everyone but the top 40%, the top 20% pay 94% of all income taxes collected, and the next 20% pay most of the remainder.  The bottom two quintiles actually have a negative effective Federal income tax rate - so it seems to me they don't have it so bad.

Yes, Aiken was an idiot - but if you're going to trot him out as being representative of the Republican Party, then it is fair game to trot out [Hank Johnson and his fears that the island of Guam might capsize](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hank-johnson-worries-guam-could-capsize-after-marine-buildup/) as being representative of the Democrats."

If one player can corner the market such that he's using a resource no one else can, he can consistently use that resource for cheap. If other players are constantly buying up one type of good, it's price rises dramatically.

Bright colours and loud prints are my favourite for bras. I don't have any good department stores around here though...we have Walmart, expensive little boutique-y stores, and then things like the Joe Fresh section in my local Zehrs. Finding good bras is a challenge. About half of my bras are the wrong size because they're all I could find and they're close. The problem is, even when I find a 32A bra, which is rare, the cups are always too narrow. My breasts are shallow and they have a somewhat wide root, so even though the cup itself is usually the correct volume overall, it's dispersed all wrong - it winds up being too narrow and too deep.

I lived alone in a 1 bedroom apartment, had 2 cats but no car, just cable and utilities. So it was a liveable wage for me. On the other hand she had a kid (single parent, the dad is deceased) and it was much harder on her. She asked me to borrow $40 for groceries until our payday, which was about a week and a half away at that point. I said no problem. I went to her house a few days later and she had her bowl out and mentioned she just bought weed to help w/ stress. I mean it's possible her parents gave her some money but it still pissed me off at the time. In retrospect she did pay me back pretty quickly so no harm I guess. We're still friends now.

Personally, I can't ask people to borrow money no matter what, and I feel guilty that my fiance's parents are helping with the wedding etc. I'd rather rack up credit card debt than ask a friend for a couple hundred bucks. "

I'm not an anti-feminist, I'm just not a feminist.  I do not want to be TOLD which movements I do and do not consider myself a part of.  I do not agree with many planks of the feminist platform. Particularly, I have problems with their opinions on maternity leave and parenting, patriarchy theory, extremely sexist legislation like VAWA, and the victim mentality of the entire movement. I have no problem with historical women's rights movement, which I respect greatly, but the modern movement is largely outdated in modern America. 

I do not align myself with ANYONE politically. I do not agree fully with anyone and thus choose to remain completely independent. I am myself and see no need to slap on ANY political labels. I am not liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, right or left. 

As I wrote in this picture, I am offended and troubled by this movement to politicize my gender. My feminity does not influence my politics any more than a man's influences his.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389718630.0,"&gt;Why is it the government's responsibility to create jobs for people.

Well why is it the governments  responsibility to do anything?   Politicians pitch ideas to the public and the public votes yay or nay.

There are legitimate underlying economic reasons why the government can or should be creating jobs in various  ways.  The government sets tax and spending policy both of which create or  eliminate jobs, and the government represents a significant fraction of the economy in  every country in the world, so government spending  ends up  being a major factor in the overall health of the  economy.  

&gt;I guess what confuses me is that in America people are opposed to government intervention with things like healthcare for example but they expect the government to give them jobs.

While those of us  with the good fortune to have not been born in 'murica and who have made good life choices so we don't have to live there may reduce the average  american voter to a single policy stance  that's  a significant oversimplification.  The US  has ~100 million  people who vote, of  about  200 million eligible and 300+ million  citizens.  They can believe in a wide variety of things (some of which can be  self contradictory or simply not factually correct - voting doesn't require you actually know  the  issues).   They can be on medicare and then believe that the government should not  interfere  with their medicare -  which is a government programme.  They can believe that government  tax policy is limiting job growth (which sometimes it actually can), and they can believe that private healthcare is better  than  public.  

&gt; Have governments always been expected to do this?

That's a large portion of why we have government at all.  Without a legal framework to  operate in it's quite difficult to run a lot of businesses.  

The point of having a commons (in the us this is the house of representatives) is to give common people their say.  If they agree  they want something they are free  to find a way to fund it (borrow or  tax  or cut something else), and have it.  

Even if you are a lone absolute monarch it is still in your interest to have a healthy economy - the better your economy the more you can loot for yourself.  Usually petty despots (think North  Korea) are more worried about  looting the country as quickly as they can before  they get turfed out, rather than making it a long term  strategy.  "

I'm as non-Paisley as they come but to suggest that he said the people of Dublin and Monaghan were 'asking for it' is laughable. That's not what he suggested at all. In fact he suggested it was the Irish government who was asking for it.

As usual in Ireland we are stuck with the same issue of people hearing what they want to hear instead of taking an objective look at the situation. People on here are as guilty as anyone else by lambasting Paisley without actually suggesting why they believe he is a bigot (I wouldn't suggest he was a bigot for venomously opposing the RC church, it's well known people of his era didn't hate Roman Catholic people but the actual administration of the church and visa versa) or a fascist (which is even more laughable considering his proposals for the UWC strike was to have an elected government). But as usual people oppose without any substance to their arguments.

If anyone was willing to actually have a proper debate about Paisley without the hate filled bile then let's have it. I'm not in the pro-Paisley camp (I'm an socialist why would I?) but I refuse to go off on hate filled rants ""bigot, fascist, can't wait until he's dead"" or any other of the usual dogmatic crap the pinko liberals in this country have.

The private school takes what it can up to capacity, and uses the funds to add additional capacity the following year.

&gt; Private school is now over capacity...

No, see above.

&gt; ...and on top of that has a bunch of troublesome kids they don't want to deal with.

Kids that it can expel if they become behavior problems, just like a public school can.

&gt; Being a private school, they can deny whoever they want.

&gt; So what happens next?

The private school adds capacity to meet the expected demand, expels the kids who are uncontrollable behavior problems, who then end up in a public school or, if they have already been expelled from the public schools their parents are willing to send them to, in an alternative school, or just out of school - just like happens now.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389719683.0,"Hollande isn't married first of all (the 'first lady of France' is a live  in Girlfriend), secondly there's some legal question as to whether the reporting is a violation  of his privacy in France, and third, it's France.

The US has very backwards views on sex, to the point of it being taboo to talk about in many cases.  Despite their rather copious consumption of porn.  France is probably too far  the other way, where people are not deeply phased by  politicians and celebrities having mistresses and having affairs.  

Bill Clinton made life worse for himself by lying about the affair under oath, and Republicans in the US were in a political position to try and use it for political gain.  Hollande... well first off all we're  early in the scandal, things could get a lot worse, but he,  thus far, has not being called into an independent investigation  about some thing and had that turn up the affair.  This seems to be the press catching he and  his security detail red  handed so to speak.   

In the US you can't really go digging through the lives of politicians to say 'hey, you had an affair too don't judge this guy!' or at least, the media won't do that.  Jon Stewart might, but the mainstream serious news probably wouldn't.  In France half the opposition politicians probably have mistresses too, and know enough to keep their damn mouths shut, lest the spotlight be turned on their  indiscretions.  

Besides that, sad sexist truth, Monica Lewinski was a mostly unattractie  whitehouse intern.  Julie Gayet is a drop dead gorgeous 40 something year old actress who is relatively well known in  France.  Most men are  probably thinking 'if I could cheat on my wife for a night with either of those women, I would pick Gayet'.  That's the misogynists Mila Kunis defence (I wouldn't cheat on you with anyone, except Mila Kunis) sort of thing.  Because people are shallow. 

 And well, obviously, Bill Clinton  was at least sort of in a  position of authority over the inters at the white house.  Hollande really has no control over the career or life of an independent film actress  who probably makes many times his salary.  The power relationship is completely different.  If Hollande was completely single having a relationship with a 40 year old actress would get him cheered on.  With a 20 something intern in his office... that throws up a few red flags.

duggtodeath,CombatFootage,1389719757.0,"Each side kills in the name of their god and civilians get caught in the cross-fire. Just because someone seems to have better reasons for going to war doesn't make the act itself just. And if anything, we went into war based on a hunch. Our gut feelings, ignoring all evidence from our own intelligence agencies. We are effectively fighting murder with murder and hoping that attrition will solve the problem.

&gt; There is a huge difference between a force which operates using international guidelines for just war, and occasionally has collateral damage...

There is the psychopathy in our shared acceptance of this fact. They aren't just collateral. Those are people. With hopes and dreams snuffed out simply because they happen to be in the way. I am sure that no law enforcement agency on American soil could get away with shrugging at the deaths of innocents in their pursuit of badguys.

&gt; ...and a force which intentionally targets innocent women and children with suicide bombs, stonings, and public beheadings.

Occasionally we break those international rules. We shoot unarmed men, rape women, kill children, toss puppies off cliffs, etc. In the past invading armies from all nations have committed unspeakable horrors on the native population. No one is innocent on either side, regardless of their moral convictions in entering the war. Has any military not done horrible things overseas? We sometimes are awful even to ourselves in peace-time; lynching, genocide, oppression, etc. Heck, we sonly recently stopped hanging people and setting them up before the firing squad. We still electrocute people and stick them in gas chambers until they die. The mode o these grisly executions doesn't make one less barbaric than the other. The Taliban are scumbags I hate everything they stand for, but we do not defeat scumbags by killing a few and then standing atop a mountain of innocents to plant the flag of victory. Wanna see the Taliban evaporate? Ruin their recruitment means and defeat poverty.

As for additional costs, it's not just smartphones (which are actually necessary for many people to get and keep jobs these days). Home internet access is absolutely necessary, especially for families with school-age children. College costs more and is more necessary than ever to reach a middle class income. Retirement support used to be assured by large families and pension IN ADDITION to income; now, families are smaller and a portion of income must go towards personal retirement funds (as you said; I would just like to convey how huge a change this is).

K2TheM,motorcycles,1389720365.0,"I recently went from a 700cc Sportbike (1984 Interceptor) to a 350c dual sport (XT350), so I feel I can weigh in on the matter.

There are two things that I miss most about the Interceptor: 

1. The smoothness
2. The power

The fist thing you will notice when going to a smaller/ less cylinder bike is how harsh it is at high RPMs. It's not horrible, but compared to a decently sized 4 cyl, a single/twin is going to feel like getting a concussive massage in all the wrong places. This could be a non issue since you could currently have a 750cc twin, so the Minja might not be all that bad in this regard.

The second thing you will notice is the lack of power. Around town/ city riding you probably won't really notice, but the first time you go to accelerate from above 30... you'll know. My XT is 100cc's larger than the 250 Ninjas, but has about the same power. I'm able to do freeway speeds just fine. It will do consistent 70mph, but is getting close to top end. If I were to really push it I could probably tap out at around 80+... but that's being hopeful. A 250 Ninja (particularly a newish one) might be able to push 100mph depending on the size of the rider. The biggest drawback to bikes of this size is the inability to quickly accelerate at speed. While at low speeds you can probably out accelerate most cars, this is not the case at highway speeds. It's also a bit frustrating to not have power available at any time.

There is a third option to consider. If you are a larger guy then a 250 might just be to small for you. I'm 6'2"" and I look a bit comical on my current bike. It's not as bad as if I was on a Rebel, but the bike does look a little small for me. I'm of average weight so the bike doesn't really have a problem moving me around, but it is a bit under-sprung.

Overall I'm happier on the XT than I was on the Interceptor. While the Interceptor was a blast to ride at the track/ back roads, it just was unfun to commute with (which is where I do most of my riding). 

I'm guessing by your situation that you are not looking to buy new. With that in mind, there are other options out there depending on what you have as capital. For about the price of a Ninja 250 you should be able to get a decent Suzuki GS500. Similar look/feel/handling, but twice the engine displacement. Still a bit anemic as for as ""sportbikes"" are concerned, but they certainly have enough power to be fun. If you are feeling industrious/ find a smoking deal, try for a SV650s. They are going to run on average 1-2K more than a 250 Ninja or a GS500, but they are a proper sport bike. However, getting an SV650 with full fairings for less than $3K will be tough. You may also be able to get into older sportbikes. Late 80's early 90's 600cc sportbikes should also be in about that price range. They won't be pretty unless they are from the mid 80's, but they could be attainable."

LyssaBrisby,sex,1389720392.0,"&gt; The way I've always masturbated is very difficult to recreate with a guy. I lay on my stomach and clutch my entire vulva, over my underwear and just grind away. I also really want to stop using this method because it makes it almost impossible to feel anything through clitoral stimulation.

But that *is* clitoral stimulation; the shaft of the clit extends into the body a huge amount, starting under the mons. There are a tonne of us grinders out there. I don't come from ""twiddling"" either -- but I can come with partners during sex in a few good positions.

[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1724jq/women_of_reddit_how_do_you_really_masturbate/c81i06n) a great link on ""how do you masturbate"" from some time ago, where high pressure grinding was the second-most popular response. From my post explaining the sensation to a confused dude:

&gt;...grinding and pressure all the way up the shaft of the clit, not just the head. When you jerk your dick, you probably pull the shaft, not tickle the head, right? Same with pressure/grinding on the mons pubis for women.
Imagine you were getting a blowjob from a girl and all she ever did was lick, suck, and tickle the head of your penis. Not only would this not get you off, it would probably be hypersensitive to the point of discomfort. Now imagine that you just hunker down and try and learn to come that way anyhow, since that's the only blowjob you ever seem to get.....
ANYWAY. The gist is, stimulating the whole clit is always going to be more successful than stimulating just the head. Even though I can come with my legs open, I'm still 99% more likely to succeed if I'm face-down and applying pressure somehow (cowgirl, lazy dog, etc).

[Here's](http://blog.museumofsex.com/the-internal-clitoris/) an article on the internal clitoris. And [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1724jq/women_of_reddit_how_do_you_really_masturbate/c81waek) a list of positions I've found successful. You are not alone!

Miss_anthropyy,TumblrInAction,1389720463.0,"What do you mean by ""support""

I donate money to causes I believe are worth it. I wrote my representatives if I believe an issue is important enough. I do not think protesting is particularly effective and I don't much enjoy doing it either. I prefer the academic study of politics and intend to influence the way politics is conducted by introducing new theories of social movements and the importance of ideology in voting choices (believe it or not, that's something of a revolutionary idea).  

Would I support civil rights? Of course. Would I take to the streets shouting slogans?  No. That's not my style. I consider it a little uncouth and I am skeptical of its effectiveness.  I'm a bigger-picture thinker and I don't like small politics. Using the system to change the system (aka the test cases) is far more interesting and effective than protesting. 

Now they had to use protesting to get there, but MLK was wonderful in insisting on civil discourse. 

You won't find that anymore.  Now people HATE the other side. They protest for the sake of protesting. They wear labels for the joy of labels, of being with a movement, a part of something, the joy of picking a side. There's no empathy, understanding, love for your fellow man. They legitimately think all conservatives are dumb, there's no reason to be anti-maternity leave or VAWA or abortion or what-have-you. Which is shortsighted. If you can't argue both sides of an issue effectively, you don't fully understand it, and thus you'll get nowhere.

you seem to be afraid of riding. you should stick to better conditions for right now, maybe the occasional night ride, but only in good clear weather and outside of the regular commuting times.

This will allow you to get over your issues with riding on roads, while learning how to control you bike, while avoiding as many other vehicles as possible.

You got to take baby steps man, and you will fall down, etc. No worries. Gotta crawl before you can walk, walk before you can run, run before you can fly. You just jumped from nothing to running! that's gonna be hard and probably not end to great.

Pick your battles. you can't learn to swim by jumping in the deep end over and over again. all you will learn is how to drown. I know it seems like the best way to learn, and it is *a way to learn*, but you don't need to learn those lessons now.

You need to focus on the basics and imo the best way to do that is only ride when it is most favorable conditions.

Don't let your eagerness to learn spoil it, just because you couldn't deal with traffic AND learn the basics of control. No one can! Separate the problems and master them one at a time."

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1389720940.0,"Love is an ideal more than something that's easily definable.  Different cultures and historical periods have defined love in vastly different ways, after all.  And of course there's so many different kinds of love - familial, friendship, ""romantic"" etc.

I think that we're a little confused as a culture because our notion of romantic love started off from this massive cultural shift in which marriage became something OTHER than a pure property transaction/familial alliance/survival mechanism.  For most of human history, people got and stayed married for reasons that had nothing to do with romantic love.  This is still true in some places.  

During this time, various forms of what polys would call NRE was, I think conflated with romantic love, because for the most part, you weren't having NRE with the person you were going to get married to, anyway.  It was unrequited or the stuff of fairy tales and romantic literature, or based on flirtations or pre-or-extra-marital affairs.

People who expect NRE to sustain itself for more than a year or two and define that as love are, in a society where one dates and marries for love, not going to find relationships to be very lasting or fulfilling.

But in relationships that experienced strong NRE initially and are based on a solid close friendship and good sexual chemistry, you can experience it in little bits from time to time.  And it feels more meaningful because even if it's the result of brain chemicals that have been stimulated by sex or physical intimacy, or even jealousy (people in open relationships know that some jealousy can be a huge aphrodisiac after all!) behind that fun chemical buzz there is a legitimate foundation of trust, appreciation, admiration, emotional intimacy, and all those nice things that make up non-romantic love.

So tl;dr: Long term romantic relationships ideally kind of are best friends who fuck sometimes, although I think it's a little more complicated than that.

Also, **BLAT** is the sound it makes on the first ignition firing after going WOT (lean condition after reving up richly). When you **BLIP** your bike goes **VROOOM BLAT**. **BRAAAAAP** is the sound a 2-stroke dirt bike makes. 

And yes, instead of ""gradually increase throttle"" you should just give it a BLIP (twist it about 20% real quick) before easing back into the clutch. Or if you blip well, you can just straight up drop the clutch and let the throttle be the control. The idea is to blip OVER the rpms you would be at in the down gear at the current speed and then let the throttle plate do your work for you, rather than the clutch plates.

But, imo, what you are doing is *ideal engine braking*, so you should definitely practice doing that while breaking severely to hone your e-stop skills. Really get a feel for that rear tire de-acceleration traction. Just don't do it in traffic, unless you WANT to be rear ended.

In school it was easier to make friends, simply because we were in school, and it was much easier to make friends when I started to become my own person and have opinions and develop an actual personality, but for the most part I kept to a small group of people with whom I enjoyed spending time.

I just moved from a small tiny apartment with no closets into a house that is twice the size of the apartment and has giant closets. The big house is way way way easier to keep clean and organized than the tiny apartment because not only does everything have a place, that place is easy to get to and items are not buried under other items. If you put your clothes in big tubs or boxes, they are going to be all over the place because you'll have to dig through them to get to what you want and take it from me--you won't put them back. It'll be a disaster. 

In short, you have too much stuff for that space and you need more space because less stuff isn't really the answer here, although you do need to go through your clothes at least every month or so and discard torn, ripped, holey, ill-fitting or not being worn items. If you toss all your pants, now you have to go get new ones and since you're not made of money, you'd better be ready to shop until you find some. 

Don't skimp on basics like pants and core tops--you can go cheap for flashy, trendy pieces but build your wardrobe from classic basics so you always have something to fall back on. If it fits well, is well made and looks good, drop the cash because it's worth it. 

As for things like purses, scarves, jewelry--you're going to have to get creative. Use your wall space--put that shit on hooks.

zhrusk,rpg,1389721620.0,"**The nature of debt in dwarvish culture**

An exerpt from *Cultures of the Northwest*, by Jenna Carrens, Professor of Cultural Studies at Greencap University of Arcane Studies.

The dwarves of Rasuh'Marr are a long-lived and orderly race. The basic dwarvish unit is the clan, and debts between clans and people are taken very seriously. Debt in the Rasuh'Marr culture is represented by giving a polished, flat stone carved with runes detailing the debtor and the debt on one side. The reason for this curious representation of debt is the oldest Dwarvish pastime of all, Felek.

Felek is played on a large round, polished stone table with a moat to catch errant stones and sunken pockets, or ""caves"" spaced evenly around the middle of the table. Players all start with an equal agreed upon ""value"" of stones. In most Felek halls, the players play with stones marked with a monetary value, to be cashed in by the player when they leave the house, but players in other circumstances may mark stones with deeds to be performed, chores to be done around the house, or promises to be made. Provided that both players agree on the relative value of the stones, any sort of markings may be used.

Players start by placing a few stones on the table. They then take turns flinging stones onto the table, attempting to knock opponents stones into the moat. Any opponents stones that fall into the moat are claimed by the current player, while any of the players stones that fall into the moat are placed back within the center ""cave circle"" by the opponents. The caves are big enough to hold one stone each, and once a stone has fallen in, it cannot be knocked out by any means, and is safe. Once all stones have been flung, players collect any of their stones that are still on the table or the caves,. In this way, players, through skill and chance, can either collect more valued stones than their opponents, or will fail to claim as much as they lose.

Stones may be kept from game to game, and indeed are often traded as a form of currency. If you have given away a debt stone, the holder of the debt may at any time hand it to you and demand the debt be resolved. To not do so without good reason is unthinkable; Dwarven clans have been exiled for failing to resolve debt stones.

Felek is not only an old pasttime, it is a sacrosanct one. Kef'lek, the dwarvish god of stone and mountains, carved the world as a Felek stone and, through play with his brother-god, Kef'fal, knocked it into a cave pocket, where it remains safe for claiming to this day. It is said that the first King of Rasuh'Marr, Loni e'Rasuh'Marr, earned his position by placing a stone marked 'King of the Mountain' amonst the starting stones, and through a series of remarkable shots and positioning, kept his challengers from ever claiming it.

During my stay at Rasuh'Marr, I had many an opportunity to play Felek with my hosts, and was even given debt-stones to compete with. I must say, that thousands of years of playing Felek have granted the dwarves remarkably nimble hands and sight. I managed, once, with a good deal of luck, to knock out 2 stones earning me 10 coin, which meant I was only 90 coins down by the end of the night. Considering the skill of my opponents, I considered that sufficient.

The author seems to identify on the libertarian side of things, which makes me wonder why she doesn't admit that having the state sanction ANY kind of marriage makes no sense.  Get the government out of marriage!  Shouldn't that be the libertarian battle cry?  It makes the most sense.  A lot of progressive queer advocates have said for a long time that rather than try to win same-sex marriage, dismantling the system that prioritizes a nuclear family over others makes more sense.  I agree philosophically, but still supported same-sex marriage because honestly, I don't think removing legally sanctioned marriage is going to happen in my lifetime.

And of course, where she really loses any libertarian cred is her insistence that non-monogamy be stigmatized.  I know LOTS of people who are open minded, sexually liberal, etc and have no interest in practicing polyamory.

The pedestrian has to wait until no cars are in view or are stopped for another reason before starting to cross.

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1389722018.0,"&gt;I asked the Orthodox yesterday what they thought your errors were. Pretty much it was ""They ignore the law."" Any responses?

As I said in my gripes above, I think it's a legitimate complaint.  Conservative Judaism's opinions on Jewish law have become more about justifying things they want than seriously considering issues of Jewish law.

&gt;Do you accuse Orthodoxy of error of any kind?

Orthodoxy is pretty heterogeneous.  Unlike Conservative Judaism, which is also heterogeneous, there isn't even a unified denominational structure in Orthodoxy.  I have gripes with specific sorts of Orthodoxy (there are things in Chassidism I'd call errors without a doubt), but I don't think there's anything I can identify as an objection to all of Orthdoxy.  Generally, I think much of Orthodoxy conflates Jewish law and religious culture/worldview (hashkafa), and adopts unnecessary strictures.  But that's not even attributable to all of Orthodoxy.  There are bigger problems with much smaller sections of Orthodoxy.

&gt;Do you pray for the dead?

As others are saying, yeah.  But Kaddish isn't explicitly for the dead, it's just an Aramaic statement praising God. (edit: like /u/WhatMichelleDoes said, it's more like liturgical mourning than praying for the dead, though many reasonings for it do involve something similar to praying for the dead)

Varryl,cars,1389722093.0,"Well, 2011 is the first year that the WRX and STI started to blur for day to day driving. They made bluetooth and USB support stock, which was super nice, and I got all the WRX premium speakers for free (it still doesn't sound great, but that's more of a head issue.) Also, seat warmers and cupholders in the back :) 

2011, they also widened the regular WRX and gave it the fake quad pipes the STI had, so, really the hardcore track parts really is what the STI money went to. You really don't feel the extra 40hp (although the big wing and my passengers say otherwise.) 

The ride was harsher, the higher car payment was a little harder to swallow, but most insurance companies don't seem to notice the difference between the two cars. I think they just see 'Subaru Turbo Impreza."" 

2011 was also the first year that synth oil was also required for all oil changes. The 6 speed is also close ratio, so you don't get a mpg or rev advantage cruising. The mpg is also not great, 21-22 on a highway good day, and 17-18 if i push it. 

Bottom line: if you plan on tracking or modding the car, the STI is great. the 6 speed is bulletproof, the bigger wheels and tires are grippier, the center diff adjuster is nice, you get a lot of stuff from the premium trim WRX for free on the STI, and a lot of the parts are simply beefier and more torque goes to the back (read: limited slip diffs)

StuHardy,WritingPrompts,1389722277.0,"""You may sit,"" said the Major. The soldier sat behind the desk. The Major continued writing, not looking up to the young, worried soldier. Eventually, he rested his materials and turned to the officer.

""Lieutenant, I want you to tell me who you are.""

""I'm Second Lieutenant-"" began the man.

""That is not what I asked you,"" interrupted the Major. ""I have gone over your records. I have spoken to your Privates. I have studied your history. And there is one thing that is absolutely clear to me: you are not who you say you are.""

""Do...do you think that I am a spy?""

""Interestingly, no. I have worked both with and against spies - deplorable men, more interested in their own thrills than the well-being and security of the greater role. No, Lieutenant, I do not believe you to be a spy.""

""Then what do you-""

""I have seen what you can do.""

""Do you mean my physical capabilities?""

""In a sense. To be specific, I saw you fly.""

The man froze. He was adamant that he had seen no-one.

""Do not be afraid, son,"" continued the Major. ""You see, you are not the first man I have seen defy the laws that God gave us."" He stood up, and walked over to the window; looking out into the dark night, searching amongst the stars. ""Back when I was a lad, I was riding my horse around the estate. My brother and I enjoyed racing each other. One day, my competitive nature got the better of me, and my horse jumped over a fence to high. The creature's legs buckled, hurtling me forward. I broke three bones, and was too far away to call for help. As my brother went off to fetch the nurse and my father, I cried out for God to help me.""

The Major turned to the Lieutenant, who was eagerly listening.

""God answered. Through the heavens, a man emerged. Not like any man I had seen before. I thought I was looking into the face of Christ himself. He lifted me and carried me back to my father's hall. Once there, he set about fixing my damaged body. My father, who was a surgeon, believed I would be unable to walk for at least six months. I was running about in six minutes. I never forgot the name of that man...

Jor-El.""

""Permission to speak, sir"" asked the Lieutenant.

""Permission granted.""

""I know who Jor-El is.""

""I believe you do; you have his body structure and hair colour.""

""He is my father. My name is Kal-El.""

""Jor-El spoke to me. He informed me that his world was dying, that no-one would listen to his warning. In my naivety, I said I would help him all I could. He smiled, then informed me that it was too late for his planet, but he was expecting a son. He had come to Earth to see what our world had to offer his son. He held me to my promise to help him - I intend to honour that.""

The Major returned to his desk.

""What other abilities do you have?""

""Well,"" began Kal, ""my vision extends beyond what can be seen - I can see through walls, but not all. No sword has cut me. No bullet has penetrated me. I can exhale at gale-force speed. If needs be, my vision can create fire. I require nothing to eat, nor time to sleep, so long as I can feel the heat of the sun.""

The Major paused, taking in all this information. ""Then I believe it is time.""

He stood up and opened a draw on his desk. ""Are you aware of the trouble we have in the Colonies?""

""The incident in Boston?""

""Correct. Those foul miscreants have cast aside the order of the crown, to form their own Republic. This revolt would be quickly crushed, were it not for those blasted French. We need to send a small force to quell this before it spirals out of control. I wish to send you.""

""What are my orders?""

""You can travel faster than any naval vessel, so you can be in the New World within a day. From their knowledge, they believe the British will only attack from the land or the sea. They will be completely unable to defend an assault from the heavens.""

""I will do my duty to God and to the King, sir.""

""I'm glad to hear it, Captain Kent.""

""Captain?""

""Of course, my son."" The Major then picked up the garment from his opened draw and presented it to the newly-promoted Captain. The front had the military command, but the back was inscribed with the symbol of his ancestors; the embelem of the House of El.

""What is this, Major Wayne?""

""Come now, Clark -  every Captain must have his own Red Coat."""

benk4,changemyview,1389722293.0,"&gt; Do you really want drivers to have to pay /less/ attention to the road? 

No, I want them to pay more attention to the road and spend less time trying to see that person who is barely visible and about to step into their lane.  

&gt; Crosswalks are well marked and are most often near intersections where you should be paying attention anyway.

There's a large number of crosswalks that aren't at intersections.  These are the most problematic ones.  

&gt; Telling people that they should stay home, or depend on others, because they don't have the right to cross the street in crosswalk is a bit harsh.

I didn't say that at all.  I said they should have to wait until the road is clear before moseying across.  They absolutely have the right to cross.

&gt; It is illegal for pedestrians to cross at a signaled crosswalk when they don't have the signal to walk.

And it should be illegal for them to cross at an unsignaled walk until the road is clear.  If the road is too busy and never clears up (or that particular crosswalk is particularly busy) that's a good sign that it should be a signaled walk.

&gt; You are trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist.

I'll admit it's not a huge problem, but I'm just saying it's the better method of doing it."

Sort of.  I'm not convinced of a historical revelation at Sinai factually speaking, but it's a religious assumption I'm happy to make.  A common Conservative view is belief in revelation of the halakhic system, without necessarily having the entirety of the content ascribed to it by Orthodoxy.

&gt;if so, what do you consider to be the winning argument for the conservative halachic process?

Well...as I said in the OP, I have problems with it.  Generally speaking, I see the correct halakhic process as acting similarly to Orthodoxy, just with a bit more structure (a central organization) and more tolerance of leniency when there's justification for doing so.  That is a Conservative view, but unfortunately it is a rapidly-shrinking one."

I can't express how much it changed the sleep dynamic. She's been fussy and difficult lately, but I'm pretty sure it's due to teething. Otherwise, she's been FANTASTIC about sleeping in her crib from day one.

benk4,Anarcho_Capitalism,1389722902.0,"&gt; I guess that's another part of why I don't really feel comfortable with minarchist libertarianism, that is a valid question.

It's a problem with ancap too.  What authority dictates that you can't kill, steal, rape etc?  Ancaps adopt a pretty similar set of property rights and rights to live, but it's they aren't entirely self evident.  They're supported by the fact that an overwhelming number of people feel that killing and stealing is wrong.  The largest difficulty with libertarianism in pretty much all it's forms is who we extend those rights to.  I don't think it's ridiculous to claim that a fetus deserves those rights even if I don't agree with it.

&gt; How might abortion laws work in an ancap world for example?

How would murder laws work?  If I killed someone what would happen?  They obviously aren't around to sue me.  Couldn't abortion laws work in a similar manner?

&gt; I'd be comfortable with that. Artificial intelligence may well actually raise this question in reality anyway, and it's not much difference between that question and this one.

Me too, but others might find that ridiculous.  The point I'm trying to make is that others might not feel the same way.  They may draw a different line as to where chimps deserve rights, just like they may draw a different line as to where a fetus deserves rights.  It's not unlibertarian of them to think so.

Thornnuminous,changemyview,1389723175.0,"I think you are misunderstanding what a scientist means by the word 'theory'. It is not the same meaning as in every day use.

Every Day use of 'theory' - from Merriam Webster dictionary:

the·o·ry noun \ˈthē-ə-rē, ˈthir-ē\
: an idea or set of ideas that is intended to explain facts or events

: an idea that is suggested or presented as possibly true but that is not known or proven to be true

: the general principles or ideas that relate to a particular subject

*Scientific* Theory is this: (from Wikipedia)

A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on knowledge that has been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experimentation.[1][2] Scientists create scientific theories from hypotheses that have been corroborated through the scientific method, then gather evidence to test their accuracy. As with all forms of scientific knowledge, scientific theories are inductive in nature and aim for predictive and explanatory force.[3][4]

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, and to its elegance and simplicity (Occam's razor). As additional scientific evidence is gathered, a scientific theory may be rejected or modified if it does not fit the new empirical findings, leading to a more accurate theory. In certain cases, the less-accurate unmodified scientific theory can still be treated as a theory if it is useful (due to its sheer simplicity) as an approximation under specific conditions (e.g. Newton's laws of motion as an approximation to special relativity at velocities which are small relative to the speed of light).

Scientific theories are testable and make falsifiable predictions. They describe the causal elements responsible for a particular natural phenomenon, and are used to explain and predict aspects of the physical universe or specific areas of inquiry (e.g. electricity, chemistry, astronomy). Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing technology or curing disease. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge.[3] This is significantly different from the common usage of the word ""theory"", which implies that something is a guess (i.e., unsubstantiated and speculative).[5]

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1389723200.0,"&gt;Wait, which rituals are those? I'd just assumed that the priestly offices left along with the Temple.

Most of their duties were, but the office is still around.  Their biggest function is the priestly blessing, which is from the Temple-era, along with performing the redeeming of the first born.  The later addition is what /u/heres_a_llama mentioned, getting designated chunks of Torah reading.  My home-synagogue doesn't allow daughters-of-priests to do any of these, except maybe the last one if no male kohanim/levites are available.  Allowing daughters-of-priests to do the designated Torah portions is the overwhelming majority custom in Conservative Judaism.  Not sure about the others, but it's more common for it to be male-only.

&gt;Do y'all believe in reincarnation, or is that mostly only found among Orthodox Jews? What's the general approach among Conservative and Reformed Jews to Kabbalah and other mystical traditions?

No.  Orthodox Jews often believe in reincarnation, but it's not universal.  There's ample room within Orthodoxy for rejection of the belief, and limited reason for acceptance.  Most forms of Judaism have at least been influenced by Kabbalah, but I'm kind of on the Litvish (Lithuanian--generally non-Chassidic, not using Kabbalah) end of things.  I think some of it may be not bad theology, but much of it is, and it's used to justify superstitions.  I don't see it as a good source of Jewish practice, unless particular things from it become communal norms, in which case it's the communal norm defining Jewish practice, not Kabbalah (even if that's the ultimate origin of it).

&gt;One of my high school instructors was a Conservative Jew who went to an Orthodox synagogue (presumably for lack of other options in the area). Do any of you do this? Does the opposite ever happen?

Sometimes.  If I were in an area with only more left-wing Conservative synagogues I'd go to an Orthodox one, and definitely would if there weren't other options.  It might for Orthodoxy, though Orthodox thoughts on Conservative Judaism vary wildly.

&gt;Are you allowed to enter churches? I recall namer saying he wasn't.

I'm not entirely sure if Conservative Judaism has an opinion on this.  There is some halakhic backing for allowing it, but even then it's discouraged enough that you'd need a good reason for doing so, and going to services would be more problematic."

I don't see why changing the speed limit would be the way to go though.  Except for the crosswalk, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to do 55 there.  Wouldn't it be easier to tell the pedestrians to wait until the road is clear before crossing?"

happycowsmmmcheese,buffy,1389723268.0,"I think this was actually a perfect example of the way the show was really set in a somewhat cartoonish reality.  Not that I think that is a bad thing at all!  In fact, it is one of the reasons I love the Buffyverse so much!  But, at times like those, especially when Xander (the comic relief scooby) is the one who has messed up, the end result is often that the worst of the harm was brushed off by the humor of everything else, and the happy-everything-is-ok-now resolution. Personally, I think there was a huge deal of that kind of attitude in the show.  One of the best examples of that being a common theme was the lack of legal backlash for Buffy after the destruction she always inevitably caused. If she had to go to court regularly, the up tones of the show would really suffer. ;)   Another example is simply the fact that Sunnydale stayed inhabited by upper-middle-class families despite the INCREDIBLY high murder rates.  You can only accept these ideas if you suspend your reality for one that is much more willing to look past a few minor spontaneous combustions.  

Basically, what I am saying is that in this alternate universe we call the Buffyverse, there has to be a balance of humor and happy endings with despair, amongst a world MUCH darker than our own, and so sometimes things are just written off, so long as there is an end resolution. "

nowthatihavefoundyou,RandomActsofMakeup,1389723558.0,"I have only used two specific highlighters and then one concealer/highlighter so I am interested in what everyone has to say. 

1. [Benefit's Watt's Up](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod3770009&amp;skuId=2234558&amp;_requestid=150330)($30): This was part of the Sephora birthday gift last year. I am not a fan of this highlight, maybe I am not applying it right (the sample did not have the blending tip the full-sized one has) or maybe my tube was dried out? It seems to move around the makeup I had already applied when I would try to blend it on my upper cheek bone. Also, it was a little too glitzy for me. 
2. [LORAC TANtalizer Highlighter &amp; Matte Bronzer Duo](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4130089)($32): I actually bought the small [travel-sized one](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5050247) ($12) to try out the bronzer and ended up liking the highlight part more (I wouldn't call it my HG though). I find it to be a nice balanced glow after blending it out, but I would not say it looked natural. The bronzer is good, I just don't wear bronzer very much.
3. [Rimmel London Match Perfection Skin Tone Adapting Concealer](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod3510085#)($5.99): This is a 2 in 1 concealer/highlight. This is my go-to everyday product. I get the ""light"" shade for my light/medium skintone because I do like to use it more as a highlight than concealer. I basically make the [upside down triangle](http://pursuitofstyleblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/makeup.jpg) across my under-eye/upper cheek area. It really brightness up the area and gives me the best ""natural"" look.

If you tell the police and lawyers upfront you're worried about blackmail charges and things, they can help you deal with that and stop him from trying anything.

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1389723915.0,"&gt;With regards to dietary laws specifically (I'm eating lunch so naturally this crossed my mind :P)

To summarize, there are several basic principles:

1. No mixing meat and milk
* Land animals must have cloven hooves and chew their cuds (cows, sheep, goats, and deer are all OK--pigs, horses, camels, rabbits, aren't)
* Only some birds are permitted.  There isn't technically a consistent rule, but generally predatory birds are always prohibited, and only birds for which a tradition of eating them exists are kosher.  Chicken, duck, pheasant, turkey, and doves are kosher, though turkey is kind of a special case.
* The above 2 must be slaughtered in accordance with proper practice of *shechitah*
* Land animals have restrictions in what cuts can be eaten, because of the forbidenness of eating the sciatic nerve
* Meat of all the above must be prepared in accordance with certain rules, including draining blood
* Fish must have fins and scales, and are considered neither meat nor dairy, along with vegetables, fruits, and eggs

Those are the basics--it gets a lot more complex.

They misdiagnosed her as having labial adhesion issues (that no other doctor has ever agreed with) as an excuse for the fact that they TRIED TO CATHETER HER AND FAILED TEN TIMES. They refused to just let me hold her over a bed pan to collect urine. To ""cure"" her 'labial adhesions', they gave me estrogen... With the incorrect instructions. No, you do NOT need to insert a full plunger worth of estrogen into a 3 month old's vagina, you need to use a q-tip of it on the affected area.

There's an absolute standard for morality? I disagree; everyone has their own morals and beliefs - even God, if he exists. Sure, he's more powerful than us, but that doesn't make his morals any better than ours. World leaders are more powerful than most of us, and that doesn't mean that their own standards and opinions are automatically better.

Morals are purely subjective, and there is no right or wrong answer (perhaps barring a few extreme examples, but if they can be defended logically, then they fall under neither right nor wrong, merely judged as such by the general standards of society). If you agree with God's morals, great. If not, then don't follow him."

benk4,changemyview,1389724479.0,"&gt; Ok, yes, depending on how you define ""a little"" in to the lane of traffic. I'm not sure how your example applies in that case, because we are talking about someone ""significantly"" walking in the traffic lane.

Sure, but if they were there long before the car then they've obviously established their right to be there.  Right of way applies to who has first dibs on the spot.  

&gt; ""No cars in view"" on a long, low traffic speed street could be a hugely restrictive rule. I'm not trying to be nitpicky, just point out that it's hard to define.

True, but on a long, low speed road you'd have time to cross before the car got there.  Or if you're particularly slow the car would have a huge amount of time to stop.   

It's already kind of hard to define.  If I walk out in a cross walk right in front of a car without leaving time to stop, is it his fault or mine?  How much time for them to see you and stop is reasonable?  

&gt; Besides the cost of electric crosswalks, which is why they aren't used more, what's the point of electric crosswalks? Solely to give pedestrians the right of way, which you are arguing they shouldn't have. Doesn't that slow down traffic as well?

Where do you live?  My town is littered with electric walks.  

But yeah that's the point.  I think the default should be that cars have the right of way, but if there's a signal then they shouldn't.  It's basically just the opposite of what we have now.  People have the right of way typically, but when there's a signal cars have the right of way until the signal changes."

At best, I can tolerate a social glass they have now and then when I'm not around, provided they're open about it.

I don't condemn people for drinking it. It's a personal thing (both their choice to drink it, and my feelings towards it). But it can cause issues. Especially with someone I'm in a relationship with. I don't want to control their life, and I don't have a right to. Even when I have some kind of control due to a power dynamic, that's still not the kinda thing you apply that to.

It's for interacting with the AWS APIs that do things like manipulate your VPCs and EC2 instances (run, terminate, stop, start, etc), not for connecting to applications/APIs that are running on the instances.  Same goes for RDS really.  Unless you're building an application that helps manage your infrastructure it's pretty rare that you'll actually be leveraging these parts of the SDK."

You'll still be limited by 3.5 shells though. The only loader I know of that will do 3.5 is the MEC Steel master, and so few people reload 3.5 that I've never seen one on store shelves or for sale new... I think direct from MEC may be the only option. 

Bottom line is that you can't really save much money reloading steel. It takes different powders, and the shot is expensive. It's usually cheaper to buy a box of factory, expecially when you consider the volume you would need to shoot to make back the cost of the loader.

I hope that nobody was hurt too badly by the anti-abortion protesters and one day if I become wealthy I will make Planned Parenthood the number one recipient of my charity.

I do recommend a squeeze of lemon in the Sierra Nevada; that's one of my favorites, especially on a hot summer day.

I would recommend for you to try some brown ales as your next step into the beer world.  If you're on the West coast, top of my list is Lost Coast's Downtown Brown; if you want something sweet they have a seasonal Raspberry Brown variant.

If you want something stronger, look for a scotch ale.  Kiltlifter and Old Chub are the two that I can find most reliably.  Be careful with that stuff, though, as it's near barley-wine strength.  You can't pound it like you can coors light.

One big thing is if you have local breweries near you.  I'm a big supporter of drinking your local brew; I'm lucky in that I have a number of local, well known breweries and can get their beer fresh. I will always take a local equivalent over the larger known beer, for example, the Downtown Brown I mentioned above vs Newcastle Brown Ale, or a local lager over something from back east like Sam Adams."

So far you have not denied the necessity of the invasions of Afghanistan nor Iraq; which leads me to believe that you are more than willing to attack and kill any who get in your way. I can only hope that you are not an American voter, so that we might not pursue these follies in the future.

That it was their fault for not looking out? No, it's still our fault because despite the other person as a driver we're expected to always be aware of what's happening.

Yeah, I would say they shouldn't have walked out in front of moving vehicles.  And then it wouldn't be my fault legally.

eighthgear,CredibleDefense,1389725709.0,"&gt;  Devices that can achieve this objective include a large low-inductance capacitor bank discharged into a single-loop antenna, a microwave generator and an explosively pumped flux compression generator. To achieve the frequency characteristics of the pulse needed for optimal coupling into the target, wave-shaping circuits and/or microwave generators are added between the pulse source and the antenna. Vircators are vacuum tubes that are particularly suitable for microwave conversion of high-energy pulses.[3]
NNEMP generators can be carried as a payload of bombs, cruise missiles (such as the CHAMP missile) and drones, with diminished mechanical, thermal and ionizing radiation effects, but without the political consequences of deploying nuclear weapons.

aDDnTN,motorcycles,1389725754.0,"&gt; My current plan is to stick to the major highways on the route into work. This is an easy ride that I'm very comfortable with.

&gt; I'm going to **continue to ride the country highway route** home from work as it's mid-day and will have plenty of light.

~~i would love to believe that i got through, but this just doesn't read that way to me.~~

oic, the country route is where he went wrong and the major routes the way he's going in, instead of the country which is where almost went down.

well, i still think he needs to stop commuting until he's a little more comfortable and that was the MAIN POINT of my original post. I definitely didn't say ""stop driving on that road"", which is what he is doing, which imo won't help.

He'll have to deal with even worse commuters on the major, with all the fun of more traffic, more intersection, more people coming at you every which way.

He is too scared to drive that bike on any road during rush hour. It's OK. I get scared sometimes too! (not while riding though). 

OP has to get over that before he can move on to the other issues, like ""what controls what"" and ""what i shouldn't do and when"".

It's anecdotal, but within a month of getting my old, poorly running '73 CB500 (that's after having it wrecked for 2 weeks. yes i wrecked on my first ride) i was hitting I-40 running to and from class. Driving on the weekends, etc. I have no fear of traffic or twisties. 

It's weird because so many people here get worked up about not riding on the interstate when you are new. I get that you should stay off on a 250cc, but the interstate is WAY safer than local streets. There is no oncoming lane. There is no cross-directional traffic or intersections. just one way flow at speed.

I think this issue might be different for me because I am reddit old at 32. If you are 22 and your number is high that means you are probably doing a lot of hooking up now and have probably not spent much time in long term relationships.

I have known some girls for 15 years, some of the best long term partners I know slept with a lot of dudes for a couple years 10 years ago.

AKA_Sotof,europe,1389726076.0,"&gt;I have never understood that. Why really? 

Misinformation. People believe nuclear power plants to be safety hazards and have waste worse than coal plants, which simply is not true. My dad used to be very pro-Nuclear power, but he has long since given up the fight against people's ignorance. A little while ago I actually had a discussion with him on the subject and he brought up how pointless it would be to make a nuclear power plant anyway. After all what is the point to use all that time and more importantly money on it if the next party in government is going to do a 180 and close it down or stop the project? 

Personally I don't hope nuclear power in Denmark is a lost cause, but I can't help but feel that my dad is right on this one. There is no real point in fighting for it, changing sentiment would take years and even then probably not make a power plant a certainty. Hell, by that time we might even have better options.

Our better option, strangely, is to rely on the Swedes to have the rationale that we lack and put more money on the nuclear power and sell it to us. That or hope a pan-Nordic union would sway things enough democratically to allow for nuclear power in Denmark.

I'd also have to note it is just plain stupid we don't have nuclear power. Our position is ideal for it. We have no real natural disasters, few enemies, a very stable society, the money to build it and the expertise to run it. But no, we have a bunch of idiots running around thinking Chernobyl is a thing that can happen with modern plants. Worst are the people who have actually convinced themselves despite evidence to the contrary that nuclear power is the most dangerous power source we have. I love my country but sometimes people here are just bloody morons."

It's the sequel to *Chrono Trigger*, a game which everyone subscribed to this subreddit should have played if they are into video games in addition to their love of The Doctor. While *Chrono Cross* is on par with the quality of *Trigger*, its problem is that it leaves so many space-time phenomena and plot devices *unexplained*. It is only after playing through the game over six times, reading developer interviews, *and* reading through the script that I finally put the pieces together.

So when I read this article with an interview of Stephen Moffat, I lean back in my chair and wonder how hard it will be to connect all the dots, assuming the dots connect to form something resembling a sound explanation? Will it be any harder than explaining *Chrono Cross*?"

However, my last name is amazing, awesome and unusual while his is boring, boring, boring and also a noun. I am known by my last name, even now that I don't use it that much any more (weird last name was inconvenient in daily life--weird last name with a hyphen? INSANE) So changing my last name was a really tough journey. 

At the beginning of the engagement, my husband was kind of offended that I was struggling with it. He said something like ""taking my last name is just assumed when you accept my proposal""--I wanted to smack him. After a small break to calm myself, we had a real talk about it. He still didn't really get it so I asked him to go away and really really think about changing his last name to mine. Forget the societal gender issues, just think about changing his name to mine. My preference was (and still is I guess) for us to both hyphenate or to combine our names to make one new name and I wanted him to think about that. 

I knew I picked a good one when he came back and actually had really done it. After a good discussion, he decided not to change his name. While I preferred that he did, I understand and support his reasons for making the decision he did because *he actually made a decision*. Due to the annoyance of a hyphenated name, I use my married name as my last name for social purposes and hyphenate for school and work purposes. "

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389726670.0,"Soo I'm going to stretch the definition of ""nobodies"" a little.  This guy is fairly well-known in Israel and was awarded the Medal of Valor.  But he's an individual soldier who affected the course of the war.  And unfortunately he has a wikipedia pages.  And he's even referenced in the wiki about the Yom Kippur War.

Anyway, the context--on Yom Kippur 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel rather suddenly, after years of low-level conflict following the Six-Day War.  Because of Israeli command missteps, hubris, and fear of activating reserves for a false-alarm, things didn't start well for Israel.  In the south, Egypt breached the Bar-Lev line with relative ease using overwhelming firepower and the clever strategy of using giant water cannons to destroy the Israeli sand and dirt wall.  In the North, Syria advanced into the Golan Heights (captured by Israel in '67) relatively easily.  Disorganized, Israeli forces struggled to stop the Syrian advance.  There was serious risk of Syria capturing the heights, which would've given them the high ground to risk sweeping across the Galilee.  Israeli tanks were seriously outnumbers, especially at first before reinforcements arrived.

Enter Tzvika Greengold, a young Lieutenant home on leave before a commander's course he was going to take began.  I can't find reference to what he'd done in the army previously.  He may've had combat experience, but I can't find in what context.  If so, it would've been in the War of Attrition, which was essentially a long series of artillery barrages and aerial battles.  If he was in tanks he wouldn't've seen much action.

Anyway, when war broke out he didn't have a unit to go to yet.  So he hitchhiked to the northern front.  He then managed to snag a tank being repaired and headed for the battle, not quite telling command who he was--over the radio he called himself ""tzvika force"".  During the battle he essentially roamed around attacking Syrian armor, sometimes with other tanks who'd been separated from their units.  He switched vehicles several times, and fought sometimes single-handed.  The narrative is kind of confusing, honestly, because exactly who was doing what is unclear.  But a guy pretty much went beserk on the Syrian army.  After being reinforced, he got out of his tank and collapsed from exhaustion, having fought continuously for 30 hours.  Exactly how many tanks he's credited as destroying is unclear--wikipedia seems to think he himself claims 20, but I've found (uncited) references to as many as 60.

Another related guy is Avigdor Kahalani, who held off a Syrian advance with his battalion of 20 tanks.  He was an actually deployed officer, though, so less ridiculous.

For reference, the Yom Kippur War's northern front was the greatest tank battle by tank concentration.  For reference, the Battle of Kursk in WW2 involved 8,000 tanks along a 1,200-mile-long front.  The northern front had over 1,000 tanks during the first phase of the battle (before major Israeli reinforcement) over a front about 25 miles long."

benk4,Anarcho_Capitalism,1389726713.0,"Liquor control is the worst.  I own a small bar, and the liquor distributors are run like car dealerships.  Each brand licenses their product to one distributor, so there's only one guy you can get each brand from. There's a few brands I want to carry, but the distributor told me I'm too small so he doesn't want to deal with me because my orders aren't big enough to justify the delivery.  Also they don't run a pickup area, so delivery is my only option.  But he will deliver to the package store right across the street and the much bigger bar across town.  Unfortunately liquor control says that I can't buy liquor from the package store and have to get it through a distributor.  And they do random inspections of your stock and will fine you if you don't have receipts.  I don't get why I can't just walk across the street and buy a few bottles.  

The same thing goes for food.  I'm not allowed to buy limes and lemons from the grocery store down the road.  That's illegal because it's unsafe and violates the health code.  I can drive half way across the state to pick up a case of limes that I'll use 1/50th of before they go bad though.

&gt; I don't have a problem with guns being legal, if regulated appropriately. 

I think we are on par with that. The question is what is ""regulated appropriately"", I'm more strict than you are on that matter. I think it shouldn't be allowed to carry them in public. And even at home it would be forbidden if it were my decision. Special places to do range shooting, well, it's ok I guess.

That's very nice of you, guy really the phobia is irrational if it is just animated stuff. That won't do any harm to you. I have no problem with guns and shooting in video game (not my favorite games, but I can play them no problem and even have fun) but real guns? That's a whole different thing.

In the morning...we go outside and pee.  Then we go back 10 minutes later and poop.  Once poop happens there are treats and breakfast and all kinds of excitement.

My first acid trip was in the city, me and a friend were walking around in different parks. I became aware of beauty that had gone unnoticed by me for many years, but the ugliness of the city was also very stark.

Being annoyed at drunk teens is perfectly natural. The experience getting to you is not because you are somehow not enlightened enough, and that negative feelings are some kind of failure. This is indeed the world in which many people live. But remember that it is only a small part of reality. By and large, the cosmos is pretty joyous :)

If you are worried about becoming broke, I recommend choosing to become broke, as an experiment. Go travelling on a low budget. What will probably happen is that you'll realize that it's not really so bad, even if society is trying to instill in you the feeling that it is a failure. You can take care of yourself, you can be happy in spite of being broke. Travelling is great practice. 

Also, while travelling, take photographs. This is better training than an internship.

Lots.  Most of my teachers in Jewish school were Orthodox, and my Jewish text knowledge is alright.  I couldn't do daf yomi, but I can follow a halakhic discussion with relative ease, read most texts, etc.

&gt;Would you be open to sitting in classes taught by orthodox rabbis/ rebbitzons? Do you read Jewish books that are more directed to the orthodox community? Do you ever have orthodox rabbis speak at your shuls even if it conflicts with his hashgafa?

I did the former all the time in the past.  Now less, because there aren't Orthodox Rabbis nearby.  Honestly, I don't do much in the world of modern Jewish text reading beyond the occasional tshuva I find intriguing.  My home-shul has Orthodox Rabbis on occasion, and is a major part of a local Orthodox-led but very diverse community Kollel.

&gt;What is your relationship with chabad?

I go there because I'm in college and hungry.  My problems with them are Chabad-specific, not Orthodoxy issues.  But Chabad isn't a form of Orthodoxy I'm terribly fond of.  But for a college Jew doing stuff with them is mostly unavoidable.  But when I graduate I'd be very reluctant to make a Chabad my community."

princesskiki,Dogtraining,1389727531.0,"If it were my dog, my approach would be a couple of things:

First, in the morning I would not talk to him or do anything until he goes outside and does his business.  I mean be cold to the dog.  Open the crate door, take him directly outside, no smiling no talking no nothing.  A stern ""go potty"" or so.  Ignore him completely until he does his thing...then reward him with your happy praising.  Now I would hopefully try to also get him to poop in this same situation and behaving the same way.  No attention no eye contact nothing until he does the job.

I would absolutely not leave him loose in the house since he has been pooping.  The crate is necessary.  It does not matter if he is panicking inside of the crate.  He has so far learned that crying/whining in the crate means that he gets let out and doesn't have to stay in it.  You've got a hard road ahead of you to train this out of him.

You also absolutely do not want to let this pooping in the house thing become a habit.  It is only going to be harder to break the longer it goes on.  I would say he absolutely MUST go into the crate right now until the dog walker comes.  

One thing I did with my dogs, because I didn't like them to be crated so long at night and during the day, is that I made sure they were observable in the bedroom (I'm a light sleeper though...) so that if they got up and acted like they had to potty, I could take them out.  My little dog sleeps on my bed so if she stands up and starts dancing around, I feel it and know that she's gotta go.  She only woke me up a few times in the beginning and then now she will sleep in.  This way I avoided the crate overnight and only had to put them in during the day.  (I also have a mid day dog walker).  



Anyways...I would take a little more hard approach.  He has too much freedom right now and he's getting into a pattern/habit of doing bad things.  This has to be broken.  Remove all freedom until he has earned it.  "

I went to night school at a state university and worked full time as a webmaster (yes, late 90's to early 00's when anyone who hardly needed to shave could get a job as a 'webmaster') with a full load of classes to get my bachelor's degree. I'd get up at 5am, be at work by 6. I'd leave at 3 or 3:30, home and eating dinner (and any remaining homework) by 4, class started at 5:40 and it took me at least 20 minutes to walk to campus. Class got out at 10:20p. The classes were four hours per night, once a week, which gave us time to do homework and write papers over the weekend. I took a full load of 16 hours, so I had class four nights a week. (For anyone who's interested, I graduated from Portland State University's School of Business Supply Chain Management program. I'm pretty sure it's still run that way.) 

Yes, it was four years of having zero fun and drinking way more caffeine and alcohol than was healthy. Study sessions would generally be held in bars or brewpubs because we were all under an unimaginable amount of stress. Then I got laid off four months before I graduated and ran up some big credit card bills in the meantime. And I still had a difficult time getting a job when I came out until I was willing to relocate for it. 

But I came out of college without debt (except for that small amount of CC debt) at 24 years old with a dual bachelor's degree.

Sure I could, but I feel like my way is a better solution.  That road is high speed, but pretty lightly traveled.  If you walk up to the crosswalk there's probably about a 10% chance there's a car in sight.  Why should we spend the money on a signaled crosswalk when it's pretty useless?  Also there's rarely pedestrians there so why should cars slow down for the 1/100 chance there's someone in the crosswalk?  

It's easy to stop if you're walking, it's also easy to see if a car is coming.  It's harder to stop if you're going 55, it's also harder to see if a pedestrian is crossing.  Doesn't it logically make sense to have the pedestrian be the one to stop and look?  It ties up all the loose ends at no cost.

biffysmalls,SquaredCircle,1389728125.0,"A one-off match on a WWE PPV (or whatever they're going to be called in the future) wouldn't do anything to establish anyone in the match or add value to the NXT brand. The only way to establish an NXT performer is with a rub with a WWE Superstar or Diva. No one gets themselves over to a mass audience, someone has to endorse or otherwise put him/her over to establish them as a legitimate character. Even when the Nexus debuted, they nonetheless needed Cena, Jericho, etc to put them over (albeit only initially). You can't do it alone. Flair needed Harley and Dusty, Hogan needed Sheik and Piper, Sting needed Flair, Austin needed Bret, Brock needed Rock and Taker, HHH needed Foley etc.

There would be far more value in a quarterly live NXT show on WWEN, that showcases the talent on a grander stage. You can always work in a past NXT feud between two Superstars or Divas once they're both on the main roster and been established, as a value add to the backstory and new feud, but there needs to be a baby step made and a character defined and embraced before you can place them in a program with someone else equally unfamiliar to the casual fan.

Like I said before, I do believe we need *some* regulations. But we have too many and they're so open ended that people can make money off of their own lack of morality. I think that people need to be the force for change and not laws, otherwise people just trust the government's judgment. People need to push for transparency from companies, they need to pay attention to the tools they're using and how safe they are, and they need to be less trusting of governments and corporations. Look at how ChickFilA's sales were affected simply because of the owner's homophobic remarks. Now imagine if that force decided to pay attention to faulty products and bad marketing. All I'm saying is that trusting in a government or corporation to keep you safe really isn't very safe in the long-run. Look at how much horrible shit our government has gotten into and look at how much horrible shit corporations get into. The bottom line is that people need to care about becoming more educated and knowledgeable rather than just trusting someone else to do everything for them and compensate them for not paying attention or being too trusting.
 
I think I chose the wrong word when I said industry, I think I would replace that with society. People need a chance to evolve, but governments prevent that. I do believe that, no matter how sad it is, natural selection needs to take its course. The smart survive, otherwise stupid people will keep having kids and they will make up the majority of the population. But honestly? I'm tired right now and I really can't keep typing, I think we both agree and disagree at the same time and we'll have to leave it at that because this kind of philosophical discussion really can't be won.

2) **The ""moves"" that women are taught and encouraged to employ are often not seen to be ""real"" moves at all.** Women have much more emphasis placed on their ability to *attract attention*- which many men (incorrectly or not) do not consider an active thing.  If you are introduced to a woman at a party and she spent two hours doing her make up and getting dressed so that she is seen as sexually desirable and then begins flirting with you which leads to you asking her out- many people would still consider you to be the one who ""made the first move.""

3) **Historical attitudes towards female sexuality (which sort of ties in with point #2) and the difficulty of promoting alternative romantic narratives on a cultural scale.** Women have not been encouraged to be actively sexual, historically speaking.  Women's sexuality has been presented as something that should be passive and that is a hard notion to shake- even as women today make strides to be in control of and responsible for their own desires, pleasure, and sexuality.  I can go and ask out as many dudes as I want but that doesn't do much to change the way that romantic encounters are portrayed in our culture.  Also to be considered is that many men still buy into these traditional narratives as well and that can cause bad experiences for women who are trying to shift them- which can be discouraging.

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389728414.0,"I don't think that the criticism of sexist portrayals in game are just about visuals. Of course a lot of them are because 

1.) It's easy to show off

2.) Because men are visually oriented and fan service for them is often delivered in visual form

But it's not the only criticism that has been levelled. You also see criticism of story (female characters not being playable, female supporting characters being written poorly, female supporting characters being killed off and only serving the hero story) and occasionally even criticism of mechanics (games that give special stats or powers to women like ""female characters get discounts"" or female = agile and male = brute force; or female = ranged and male = melee; or female = support healer class and male = take damage class), she who shall not be named criticism that Peach's super power in Super Princess Peach were her mood swings etc. 

=&gt; yes, I realize that you can consider all of that fluff too but to me that's closing your eyes to how the world works. If you buy into this criticism existing that means that certain attitudes did go into the making of those games or that the creators intentionally buy into the mindset their core audience has or they at least assume their core audience has. Is it really that unreasonable to assume that this worth talking about, since if these attitudes exist it does affect real people down the line whether it is people working in the industry or consumers? 

There are also cases where certain attitudes within the industry have actively held back games, such as games being pressured not to have a female protagonist or being pressured not to put their female characters front center on the cover.   

The truth is, that games are more than mechanics these days. Whether you like it or not, a game with exactly the same mechanics, but one time it's skinned as a gloomy post apocalyptic shooter and one time it is skinned as shooting bubbles at unicorns would draw different sales. Would chess have become as popular if the game *forced* you to play with pieces shaped like realistic penises rather than allowing itself to be skinned in all kinds of different ways?

You can judge mechanics different from theme/aesthetics, but the overall game is a combination of mechanics and aesthetics. Would you play a game with perfect mechanics if the soundtrack was a constant ear piecing beeping? Theme adds to a game, as does story, as do graphics, as does soundtrack. An amzing, perfect soundtrack can elevate a game experience and an awful one can drag it down. So why would graphics be any different? You can divorce mechanics from theme, but that just means that saying ""these are really good mechanics, I would have enjoyed them a lot more if the theming/soundtrack/graphics were better"" is a perfectly valid appraoch. The overall game is still more than just mechanics, it's all the different parts working together. 

Not to mention that that doesn't cover that many games these days have the same or at least highly similar mechanics and hence the way they distinguish themselves from each other, the way they argue that you should buy them over their brethren is with all those other elements like story or character or graphics or setting. 

Just because you consider mechanics to be the purest way to talk about games doesn't change that a lot of people, male or female, just do not work that way (and the fact that the industry DOES care about whether you skin your main character male or female or whether you put them on the cover means that the industry firmly works on the assumption that it does indeed matter a lot [which affects what games sell, what games get funded, what mechanics reach popularity). And if shallow things like story or theme or graphics entertain them why shouldn't those needs be met. Graphics and theme have always had a role in games, in why people buy them, in why people make them. Otherwise we could just as well be playing Simon Says with shapeless blobs on the screen with no music because, dude, tight mechanics! "

Then feminists have failed feminism. Numerous laws discriminate against men (VAWA, Selective Service, etc) and none against women(with the possible exception of walking barechested in public in NY, and joining the Navy Seals), yet the present situation is still framed as female oppression. 

&gt;Any movement or group that attempts to discriminate against, by definition, cannot be feminist. They can call themselves feminists, but they aren't.

Then feminists aren't feminists, and the true feminists are MRAs.

Renner1,syriancivilwar,1389729015.0,"&gt; Remember, lots of Syrians decided to join ISIS when they realized how effective and well funded the group is. I doubt every single member is a hardcore jihadi. Also, it's not like all of them cannot reform. We have plenty of cases of people giving up extremism. As for Syrians not being able to live together. Look at Northern Ireland. It's not perfect, but they have made it work. 


Sure, I agree that I should take that into account. You would think that this would be a good time for those who joined with the ISIS because of pragmatism and don't agree with the rabid takfiri ideology to bail and join up with the others at least.

I am pretty doubtful about those who solidly believe in the ISIS ideology being able to reform for civil society or otherwise accepting that no one wants their puritanical, abusive theocracy ruling in Syria.

&gt; As for them not executing, maybe they realize that they will not look any better then ISIS if they do. The FSA and the IF have a chance to do so much needed PR repair right now and appear to be taking it.

Maybe. 

But their PR is shot enough considering that Nusra and the IF are on the same side as the FSA, and FSA leaders, out of pragmatism, haven't done away with them.

IF and Nusra for the most part are going to start behaving more or less the same as the ISIS-- maybe marginally less terrible, but Nusra is the official AQ branch now and IF is mostly rabid Salafi Jihadis."

superspeck,HomeImprovement,1389729067.0,"Oh, man, the things I could do with $1700!

Ok, first, what does your house need? What kind of house is it, and what are you doing with it? 

Out of the brands available at Home Depot, my preference is strongly in this order: Makita, Bosch, DeWalt, Milwaukee/Skil, Rigid, Ryobi, Black &amp; Decker. Use the prices of those tool brands to judge other tool brands. You get what you pay for. Ryobi and Black and Decker are the cheapest, but some tools are dangerous because they're underpowered. 

Also, don't buy Ryobi cordless tools. The batteries don't last under reasonably heavy use. 

You didn't say what power tools you have. I'm going to assume that you don't have any of what I'm writing out below. 

* Drill/Driver and Impact Driver set. These are two different tools. Don't cheap out here -- better brands will have longer battery life. Get a drill/driver with a spin chuck so you can use normal drill bits. The impact driver is used to drive screws into things. Everywhere I can use screws, I have used screws as I renovate -- they hold better over longer time and it's easier to repair/re-do work done with screws. But there's lots of places you can't use screws. *Don't bother with anything cordless except a drill driver and impact driver. The battery doesn't last long enough and it's worthless.*
* Sliding compound miter saw. If you're not going to be doing much work, you can safely cheap out and buy a Ryobi here. However, if you want to make accurate trim cuts, you will want to up to at least DeWalt. This is used to cut most small lumber, flooring, trim, and just about everything else. This is my most used power tool after a drill and impact driver set. 
* EITHER a table saw or a corded circular saw with an 8' track. Don't cheap out if you buy a table saw; table saws that are underpowered will kick back more often. This tool is mainly to cut 8' sheet goods (plywood, OSB, MDF) and, if table saw, to square off lumber and other products. 
* Oscillating Multitool - Rigid or DeWalt is fine here. This tool lets you make flush cuts. It's insanely handy. For instance, you can use it to truncate shims and to undercut door trim so you can lay flooring underneath it. 
* If you have a lot of demolition to do, a sawzall (reciprocating saw) gets really handy fast. I think I have a Milwaukie. Same with an angle grinder. 
* I have a Bosch Bulldog combination demolition hammer / impact drill. This is used for concrete work, and is the smallest reasonably able tool like it. You can use it to chip up concrete, remove tile (although renting a larger tool for this purpose is better), drill into concrete to mount bolts or insert rebar, remove bathroom wall tile, and a bunch of other tasks. It beats the hell out of chiseling anything by hand.  
* Compressor and nail guns - A compressor has 101 uses, and is probably my third most frequently used tool after the drivers and miter saw. If you're doing mainly trim work, you will want to get an 18ga and a 15ga nailer. If you're doing any framing or siding, you will want a large stick framing nailer. If you're doing any roofing, you will want a nailer that shoots coiled roofing nails. I spray oil paint with a cheap HVLP gun; I get a perfect spray finish every time. Other tools I can rent at need, like flooring nailers. I personally prefer oiled compressors over oilless. I have a DeWalt/Emglo double hotdog that is available at Lowe's. "

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1389729350.0,"No problem, I see your points.  I'm coming at this from the perspective of someone who's been in fandom and nerd culture online - and then in the real world - since 1994, when I was a young teenager.  I don't believe that Ferrett meant any harm by this or his other writings that are somewhat problematic, but I also don't that at the time he was very sensitive to the rampant culture of sexual objectification, misogyny, male entitlement, etc etc in fandom/nerd culture.  (Which, to be fair, I think is getting better, as far as I can tell from the outside, but my experiences in my teens and early 20s with men in that culture are a part of why I'm not interested in being a part of it anymore.)  I think in that thread he displayed a real myopia of why the OSBP was, as they say, ~problematic~ and talked a lot about why it was great for HIM instead.  It was yucky, even the apologies still seem to not really ""get"" exactly why this upset people.

Like I said upthread, I don't even think this history is that relevant to this particular piece, because it has nothing to do with proscribing female sexuality or saying how men should treat women sexually.  I had a ""Oh, that name sounds familiar!"" when I first read the post, then quickly remembered WHY it was familiar, made an offhand comment about ick, but also said the messenger wasn't important to this particular message.  I certainly didn't want to turn this into a referendum on Ferrett's personality or past behavior.  I don't even think he should be pilloried for his past behavior assuming he's grown and learned since then.  It was just an offhand ""Oh, yeah, THAT guy.""

I was reading something about how some people have dogs that wake them up relentlessly in the morning...and that this can sometimes be a nuisance for someone who might want to sleep in on occasion.  The thought was that these people tend to wake up and feed their dogs almost immediately...before they get ready for the day themselves.  So the dogs have that huge anticipation of what will happen in the morning.  ""OMG FOOD!  Wake up mom wake up!!""      The idea then was in order to train that behavior out of the dog...put the dogs breakfast LAST on the agenda in the morning.  Let them get used to that routine...and then they wouldn't be so anxious to wake you up in the morning.   Kind of interesting but totally makes sense.  My dogs sleep in...but they also don't really get breakfast early or anything exciting.

Essentially the issue isn't autism but the environment, a child raised in an area full of disruptive stimuli will show delays and signs of abuse. Interestingly enough the low functioning are becoming rarer at a growing rate, partially due to changes in technology to increase efficiency decreasing the toll they take on one's senses and partially due to more high functioning people having kids (those kids have a major advantage over the autistic children of NT parents). Furthermore groups that would be able to make a genetic test refuse to do so because their findings conflict with the mentality of most, they don't want to be responsible for essentially enabling genocide (especially considering that some major groups have already expressed attitudes supporting it)."

agentup,bestof,1389730387.0,"I agree with everything the Rebris said, however the problem is these ""what it is like to be poor"" posts always assume life won't get better. While working for 8 dollars an hour, you should be on the look out for a better job. If you don't have health care you should look into Obamacare. And before anyone scoffs, it's still better than nothing.

Second tickets are a poor tax plain and simple.  200 dollars to some rich fat cat is meaningless. He'd probably just hand over the money to the cop at the stop, but for a minimum wage worker, it is a life changing amount of money. However there are options. Namely going to court to get it dismissed. Yeah you'll have to take off work most likely, but more than likely the cop won't show up, it will get dismissed.

However all these are examples and rather meaningless to the overall point. Which is being poor is like trying to swim with weights around your legs. So the key is to always be looking for ways to cut the chains. 

Education, even just online courses is good. Take online photoshop (pirate it if you have to). Take online coding courses. None of that your bag? Read marketing books, learn how to sell yourself. You'd be surprised how many good jobs you can get if you know how to chat someone up. Knowing how to do a job interview is a skill in and of itself. Don't just go in there thinking ability is all that matters."

A car was coming along the road but slowed almost to a stop at the speed cushion before the crosswalk.  I thought he was yielding to me like he's supposed to, and began jogging across. I always try to make eye contact with drivers (cyclist's habit) and as soon as I saw he was looking down instead of at the roadway, while still rollling forward, I realized he wasn't stopping. Jumped back and pulled my dog back, but he hit my dog with a loud ""BANG"" and then just drove off.  Asshole didn't even check to see if I was ok. The driver behind him (a normal person, who stopped to check on me) got his plate # and I phoned it in to police.  However, because I wasn't injured (just my dog) it's unlikely that they'll do anything about it.  If they contact him though, at least maybe the thought of getting caught will make him pay attention to the damn road the next time. Very upsetting.

BelleLune,breastfeeding,1389731036.0,"When I bought my pump, I was choosing between Medela Pump in Style and an Ameda Purely Yours. Most people seemed to recommend the Medela and I hear great things about it. The only complaints I found about it were about mold getting into the motor since it's an open system and not knowing about it until they randomly needed to look at the motor one time. 

The Ameda is a closed system (so milk can't come in contact with the motor) but seems less popular. I read some negative reviews stating that it loses suction after a few months.

Personally, I ended up choosing the Ameda Purely Yours and haven't had any issues with it. I never tried a Medela, so I can't really compare. I pump a decent amount of milk, it's comfortable, quiet, and easy to use. I just liked the idea of having a closed system vs. an open one. However, I do wish it had a letdown feature (not sure if Medela does?). Again, I've never actually HAD one with a letdown feature to know if it would help, but it takes a good while for me to letdown and I can only get 1 letdown per session. Whereas when I'm nursing, I letdown fairly quickly and usually have 2 letdowns per nursing session. But that just might be the difference between pumping vs. nursing rather than the pump itself. Who knows. But I have no complaints about the Ameda Purely Yours other than I have to order parts online because they don't seem to carry them in stores :\"
diamonte,Equestrian,1389731043.0,"I agree with RonRonner's suggestions. Here's a few of my own, too:

I think it would be a good idea to take things back to basics and start addressing it on the lunge line, by getting him more responsive to the whip and pushing him forward. Don't try and learn on a baby, but if you can long-line (or even just use an outside longline through the surcingle and a normal lunge line attached to a cavesson) it's an extremely effective tool.

I worked with a gelding this summer that got this way. I had another person assisting me with him. We kept the whip down and dragging on the ground as he lunged in a circle. Then raise it off the ground. If he doesn't respond, get after him. I don't like cracking the whip, so the other person would be on a bit larger circle around me and touch the back of his legs with the lunge whip. That was usually enough to get him going (just make sure to stay safe and prepared in case he reacts badly.) Once he was in tune and paying attention to the whip after a few session, the rider would get back on. Using your voice to cue the horse as you lunge them is a really good tool too - but if he does something wrong, like cantering when you just wanted a faster trot, just go with it and let him keep cantering for a little bit (as long as he's being polite). The important part is FORWARD. Don't let him have a lazy trot or choose the tempo he wants, push him forward.

Still working in the round pen, the whip person would be in charge of getting the horse moving. The rider is there just to sit there and maybe start feeling the connection to the horse's mouth a little bit. If he's still respecting the whip, then you can start applying the leg pressure and using that instead of the whip as the primary cue.

Once you leave the round pen and start riding him in the big arena again, you'll still probably need that person on the ground from time to time, to back you up with the whip. Again, if he's forward but sometimes has to break into the canter, that's okay right now. Just push him forward - don't let him use that as an excuse for not working - then bring him back to the trot when you're ready.

Also, if the rider uses the whip on him, don't use it just on the shoulder repeatedly. What I find works very well (and doesn't encourage bucking/kicking) is to quickly alternate - tap him on the shoulder, haunches, shoulder. Then be done with it. It's a good way to spark them up, but they don't see it as a challenge like repeated tapping on the shoulder or haunches. (My boy was offended if you'd repeatedly tap him, and would buck.)

Another good thing to do is play follow the leader, if you have a willing participant (ha!). Having another horse in front of you and following it at a steady pace usually gets a young horse's interest. "

lalimalina,TwoXChromosomes,1389731349.0,"Also, just so you know, the instead and softcups are nothing at all like reusable menstrual cups. I love reusable cups but I HATE softcups; they are so uncomfortable and don't fit properly. They may work for you, but if they don't, don't let it turn you off to reusable cups in the future!

If I were you I'd order a Lunette cup and buy a box of Softcups and maybe one of those sponge things somebody else mentioned. You should have one more period before your wedding, right? Try out everything during it, and if (and only if) you become completely comfortable with one of them, use it for your wedding. I'd try the reusable menstrual cup first but that's my personal preference showing. No smell whatsoever like you get with tampons and pads, and they're very secure, and you can basically forget you're on your period for 12 hours at a time. On light days I've even worn a cup for up to 17 hours when I was too busy to change it."

As well as many other 20 somethings I have no idea where I want to go in life, I am not sure of my major (intl. finances), I am good, but not amazing, and whilist wall street is the dream, I am doing nothing to achieve it, so it isnt that much of a dream. 

When I am thirty, I wish I have already traveled a fair amount, been to tomorrowland, seen lady gaga in concert, ran a full marathon, and stop being so alcohol-dependant. When I am thirty I see myself living in a penthouse (or a apt with an amazing view.. the view is waht matters not the size of the house), and in a stable relationship. Depending on where I live, I may or may not have my dream car. I hope I also lived in NYC for a while, I just love it there. I want to find something I am really passionate about, and use it as a hobby, maybe as a means of extra cash. I hope my finances are stable and better than I expect them to be. No kids, but if they do come, well hey c'est la vie.

superspeck,RealEstate,1389731507.0,"Where at? You need to make sure, first, that the house was built in a way that's appropriate for the climate. I'd be able to give you advice on things to check in a Zone 2 or 3 house, but any colder than that and someone else would have to tell you. 

In my family, we've moved every four years since I was a small child, and we'd usually buy a property in need of rehab in a very nice area. That meant lots of problems and lots of renovations. We have a practice that we call ""residential archaeology"" that helps us figure out what state the house is in based on both surface and deep investigation. 

When looking at property, I carry a small level and a laser distance finder with me. I can use these two tools to help lead me to parts of the house that aren't right. The laser rangefinder can tell you if a room is square. The level obviously tells you if floors are level or walls are plumb.

The first thing we look at is the structure. We look to see if the floor is level, if there are any parts that are 'soft' or sagging or make noise, if there is cracking in the walls or ceiling, if doors close smoothly and don't have big gaps that would indicate settling, etc. Then we try to follow the damage back to a central point and try to figure out what is wrong with it. (e.g. in my current house which is built on a slab, there is movement in one wall due to the location of the HVAC unit, which was replaced in 1996 and put in a different location than it was supposed to be. It can't easily be fixed without removing the unit. In a house I was looking at, there was a pier that was settling, and that's what caused the stairs to squeak and the drywall to crack near it.) We look really hard for water damage or signs of water damage being repaired. Same with insect damage. Structural damage is almost always an instant wave-off, especially on slab homes. 

The second thing we look for is signs of renovation. Places where textures don't match on walls, changes in flooring material where it otherwise doesn't make sense. If we find those, we check to see if there were permits pulled. If there weren't, we prepare ourselves to completely re-do it, because it means that the electrical may not be up to code and might be hiding deeply scary things. We look for shortcuts, like using old T-111 as sheathing behind more modern Hardi siding. Thirty year old T-111 can continue to rot behind the new siding and makes a poor nailing surface.

The third thing we look for is stuff that's no longer up to a reasonable approximation of building code. Old windows, aluminum wire that's past it's sell-by date, old HVAC, old water heater ... all of these things will subtract from the offer we make or at least form points for negotiation. But if we subtract more than 10% from the purchase price before we get to the offer stage, than we're probably going to walk. 

Those three things are done on the first viewing of a house that we decide might be one we'd want to buy. (Yes, my real estate agent LOVES me. Actually, she thinks we're hilarious because we look right past any staging or decoration that's been done. I'm sure to ply her with Starbucks and other bribes.)

On a second showing just before we put an offer in, I will bring my inspection scope, a GFCI tester, and some other small hand tools. If I'm permitted, I will make sure that circuits that should be on GFCI outlets are, will take a pretty careful dig through anything I can access (sticking the inspection scope up chimneys and vents and in existing holes in otherwise inaccessible areas in the attic). I've waved off of signing a contract because I discovered major damage during this stage. I shoved the inspection scope down a hole with some Romex, and discovered a wall full of active termites. I'll make sure that sinks tubs and toilets all flush/drain properly and look as carefully as I can for leaks or signs of leaks, like efflorescence in brick. 

Note that some of the inspections you indicated need to be done by separate professionals. I think I paid $375 for a general home inspection that covered electrical and structural, $150 for a HVAC inspection. A plumbing inspection would've been another couple hundred bucks and would've informed me of a few things but wouldn't have changed the purchase decision. I was present for all of the inspections and made sure before I hired them that they were OK with me following along. Trained inspectors are definitely more through than I am, but I'm faster and cheaper when I'm already looking at the house anyway. "
someguyfromtheuk,AskReddit,1389731508.0,"haha, it wasn't that exact file, it was something I'd come across on the internet. The file I saved is lost somewhere within my harddrive now so I posted the one I found when I googled her name."
Renner1,worldnews,1389731512.0,"&gt; I think it really depends on which museum or book you are looking at. In elementary school, we learned only about Jews being killed. In junior high and high school, we learned that many groups were killed. If you go to the Holocaust museum in DC, they have slightly more emphasis on Jewish people being targeted in the Holocaust, but they don't ignore any parts of the Holocaust. 

I've seen presentations that don't talk at all about the Romas or the Slavs, and I've met Jews who go around-- and they do obsess over the holocaust and pretend as though another one's going to magically come-- telling people that the Slavs who were murdered weren't victims, that the Poles and the Russians ""deserved to die"" because ""anti Semitism from Slavs"".

&gt; Not that it's an excuse for Israel's actions against Palestine, but if you study the Holocaust, and older European history, it's understandable why Jews want a homeland, which is why I think Israel has the right to exist (with pre-1967 borders). 

I don't oppose their wanting a land somewhere. I oppose the way they went about doing it since 1920 and their constant attempts to erase the idea of the Palestinians living in Palestine and the fact that they had been living there for a very long time. 

The idea that they thing they could try and push ""it was all just sand and Bedouin, we Jews created everything worthwhile"" is just sickening.

I don't think they have any right to live there-- apart from maybe the 10% they legally bought-- but I recognize they're not just going to pack up and leave. I think the Israeli idea of the two-state process is a farce, plain and simple. I think the international community, particularly the USA and Western Europe, would have to twist the Israeli arm until it breaks for anything to seriously be accomplished in terms of a proper two-state solution.

&gt; I agree that all three ideologies at terrible. But you can't ban an ideology. As soon as you try to outlaw one of those ideas, those groups will suddenly feel oppressed, and start violently protesting, seeing themselves as freedom fighters. And if you ban literature from those ideologies, people are going to be both confused and curious about those ideas, which might lead to an increase in those ideas.

That's true. I guess the hypothetical idea would be to make it known exactly what Salafi Jihadism/takfirism is, and have it managed by people who aren't idiots and who will act very hardly against those who fully believe in takfirism.

I don't think it's hard to convince people that neo-Nazism is shit, although a lot of people in Canada are still hung up over the idea that Jews are the primary targets of the neo-nazis.

Banning and punishing Zionism and the worst kinds of Zionists would probably be the most difficult one to pull off, considering how there's a lot of people who'll support the concept because ""Jews are innocent and can't do anything wrong"", and they'll just act oblivious in general.

&gt; In regards to cross dressing, are you against transgender people, or just people who dress up for sexual pleasure, entertainment, or some other reason (the activity usually referred to as cross dressing)? 

What I think is off-putting and weird is the concept of ""transgenderism"" itself. I find that the majority of the ""M to F"" transgenders end up looking atrocious and still obviously male, and it freaks a lot of people out.

&gt; From what I have read, it's a law that can be applied to almost anything even remotely homosexual, but it's not evenly enforced. It's similar to the charge of ""resisting arrest"" in the US. If you are being arrested, and ask a question, don't stand up fast enough, or try to move to make yourself more comfortable, the police can also charge you with resisting arrest to make your sentence longer. Both are laws that give police a ton of power, giving them the choice of which activity is worthy of arrest. 

&gt; So assume a gay couple is seen holding hands in public. They are both patriotic Russians. The police won't arrest them. Another gay couple is holding hands. They are known to dislike Putin, and have spoken out against United Russia and their policies. The police can arrest them for ""spreading homosexual propaganda"". 

Then the problem ultimately lies with the more authoritarian tenets of the United Russia party and their view of increasing their control of Russian society in general.

The collective aggressive LGBTs in America and Western Europe not giving two shits about every other issue with United Russia and in Russia, and encouraging the self-identified LGBT movement in Russia to ""get more loud and proud and aggressive about your sexuality"" isn't helping anything in the least.

&gt; Most people who believe homosexuality is a disease don't make a distinction, they usually believe that if you are not attracted to the opposite gender, you have a mental disorder. Some also believe asexuality is a mental disorder, some don't. 

Regardless, perpetuating this obscene, ridiculous image and saying ""this is the epitome of gay popular culture"" doesn't do anything to change people's minds in the least.

The only reason I'm not more against it is because I know gays that don't buy into that ridiculous image and don't define themselves and everything they do based off of what they do in the bedroom."

Those plans are guaranteed 94% actuarial value by reducing deductible and out of pocket maximum on top of the tax credit which drives premiums for those plans toward a maximum 3% of the modified adjusted gross income of the one being insured. If a person is even moderately sick this benefit can be several orders of magnitude more than they're paying into the system.

Below that is medicaid expansion which is very cheap. Although, a big problem is that benefit is extremely means tested and at 150-200% of poverty level the actuarial value drops to 87% actuarial, then to 73% actuarial between 200-250%. After that you're down to the basic plan.

The Ameda has a suction knob and a speed knob, so I can turn the speed up to really fast along with a comfortable suction to try to simulate letdown, but it's not quite the same. I feel like a letdown feature might help get things going, but I haven't had a chance to actually test that theory. I don't feel like mine has lost suction at all. Every review I read that said anything about that, said that it happened around 3-5 months of use. I'm almost curious if maybe they just needed to change the valves and didn't know. I've been using mine for about 4 months now and the valves are just starting to seem like they might need changing, but I don't feel like the machine has lost suction at all. 

BUT, I do really hate that I can't buy Ameda parts in stores. I had a situation where my wonderful husband tried to help me one morning by washing my pump and parts for me since I was running late and he tore one of my valves. He didn't realize it at the time and I didn't know until I tried to use my pump at work and the one side wasn't sucking at all! I saw the valve was ripped and we couldn't find our spare valves (the pump came with 2 or 3 extra sets of valves) and no local stores carried them. So I had to order them online and wait 2 days for them to be shipped to me. Wasn't fun. I had to pump one side while manually expressing the other and ended up going home early one day because I just wasn't pumping enough milk :\ But there are Medela parts everywhere!

Granted, I imagine he locked a bunch of people away for being Islamists and that did create a climate of radicalization-- but at the same time it's been proven again and again that Salafi-inspired conservative Islamism is a failure in terms of being the governing force in a society, not the least because of it's rigidity and the fact that the majority of the people will hate it.

&gt;  If ISIS has disbanded in the meantime, or some leaders have abandoned it, you might get them to put down their arms - as happened to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Either way it's more humane than outright murdering POWs.

3DGrunge,videos,1389732125.0,"&gt;Again, why are men choosing to not get an education (because education in the United States cannot be denied to anyone because of Race, Religion or Sex under the Civil Rights Acts)? But then again, are they not getting an education? Men can be, say plumbers, a trade that doesn't require a college degree thus taking one male out of the statistics. Its like unemployment in this country now: yes unemployment rates are dropping like crazy, because those numbers are based on people collection unemployment benefits which are ending for thousands, if not millions. Your fact assumes that men are now less educated than women because men don't always work in careers requiring them to earn graduate degrees.

Prime example of refusing to acknowledge that men can be victims.  It is the evil mans fault that they do not get an education.  It couldn't possibly be that men are offered less scholarships and receive less help from families to pay for college.  It couldn't be that men receive little to any support during college.  Men also couldn't possibly be graded more harshly while in school and given less leeway on time frames of assignment completion.

Men are not afforded the same opportunities as women and are often required to work harder because of that.  Women have who are just as capable as men are offered more benefits and given extra consideration on entrance and scholarships.

&gt;Ok, lets look at stereotypical careers for men and women and see which is more dangerous: Man: Construction. Woman: Secretary. Man: Soldier. Woman: Nurse. Man: Law enforcement. Woman: house cleaner. Just those stereotypes alone dictate that men choose and dominate careers that are, on average more dangerous. You want the right to be a secretary? Why not, we call them Administrative assistants now. Be a nurse: male nurses are no longer looked down upon. You want to live a long life, in a safe career, then choose one.

Blaming men again eh?  I doubt a man would choose to do hard ass manual labor in a low paying job over a nice safe well paying job.  Men do not go out of there way to choose more dangerous jobs.  They are the jobs left.  Men are pushed to dangerous positions because no one gives a fuck if a guy dies on the job.  A woman is protected and thought of as a delicate and special individual where as a man is a cog in a machine and nothing more.  Used up and spit out.  Women are more likely to be hired than men when applying for nursing, secretarial and other such jobs.

&gt;Sorry, this is biological. Unless, your quest seeks to deny medical coverage to women, which I doubt. Between 1900 and 1998, there was not one year that the life expectancy for a woman was less than a man. Source[2]

Biological?  Nonsense.  Men die younger due to working longer hours, more dangerous jobs, and being higher risk takers.

&gt;Because women are the weaker gender. They can't endure the harsh realities of prison. There's also this[3] that shows that women, based on arrest records, commit less crimes than men so perhaps, we're just jaded at seeing all these guys killing other people.

It isn't because women are too weak for jail.  It is because men are capable of evil while women are not.  Women can only create life and do good things.  Where as men just destroy everything.

Also using an arrest record to prove who commits more crime is idiotic.  It proves that women are arrested less that is all.


&gt;Men should have the right to raise their child if the woman does not. Paternity should be established before child support is awarded (because it can't be un-awarder after the fact for some stupid as fuck reason). However, try this: GET MARRIED, HAVE SEX, HAVE KIDS. Then you won't have to worry about reproductive rights, because you'll BOTH WANT THEM. You can't claim the sanctity of life based on religious reasons if you're having sex out of wedlock and if you are married, then I'm pretty sure you could get a nice divorce settlement out of most judges, even here in my state of California.

Men have no right to get an abortion or to not get an abortion.  Women do.  How is this fair that as a man my child and its fate rests solely on the whim of the woman.  And if I chose that I did not want the child It would not matter.  I would be financially responsible for it when it was born no matter what.  Men get the shaft when it comes to paternity almost always.

&gt;Men have it good. We get paid more,

Men do not get paid more actually.  Studies that say so are old and or forgetting to base it on equal employees with equal education and work experience.

http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2010-09-01-single-women_N.htm?csp=34money

Also they often forget that dangerous jobs the ones that are dominated by men often pay better due to the risk of you know... death.

&gt;more likely to be a business owner

This has to do with men being more likely to take risks.  But nope its because men are stopping women right?

&gt;are more likely to be wealthy 

Yes men are more likely to be wealthy due to their working longer hours more years and taking risks.  Men are also more likely to be poor.

&gt;less likely to be publicly ruined for scandalous behavior

Hey look something good about being a guy.  Wait never mind.  This is simply not true.  Men are constantly falsely accused of scandalous behavior have their lives destroyed.  The same is not true for women.  As they are thought of doing no wrong.  Only men commit crimes and do evil deeds.

&gt;Why is this: Because we as men have made it this way.

Society as a whole has made it this way.  You self hating douche."

lemonylips,AskWomen,1389732715.0,"AskMen isn't very familiar with a lot of sex toys... and just coming out and being like I WANT YOU TO WEAR A PENIS SHEATH is going to make a lot of guys feel badly about their dicks- so they're going to approach it from that angle (*a penis sheath makes my dick bigger = she wants my dick to be bigger = my dick isn't good enough*) unless you explain it to them more completely.  Also none of those guys are involved with you so they have no positives (like how cool you are) to weigh this request against.

I would, first, look for sex positive or kind friendly people to date- these people generally have more knowledge and experience when it comes to sex toys and have a better understanding of how people's preferences are not a reflection of their shortcomings or whatever.

Secondly- talk about fullness, talk about penetration, talk about humiliation if that's where it comes from (but I'm guessing it probably isn't).  Speak first in general terms and then narrow.  Maybe talk about how it would be hot for your man to slip some fingers in next to his dick while he's inside you.  Get him used to the idea that you desire extra fullness and that he is sexy for providing you with it by whatever means.  Then maybe bring up dildos- during foreplay or as their own act.

Then we continued saving the extra and used that amount as a down payment on a house. Even though we were approved for a $140,000 mortgage, our house cost about half that. Our monthly payment is $535 and that includes insurance, taxes, and interest. (This is a 4/2 house by the way... And rent for a 2/2 typically costs about $800/month here).

I married a Christian as well.  My wife still goes to church every Sunday.  She believes in Intelligent Design(which at least is a step from...*poof*...humans.  Though she started out being a creationist before meeting me.

She broke up with me a few times over religion.  From friends and family telling her to find a nice Christian boy to her not being able to manage her feelings for me and the fact I do not believe.  

I was and still am in touch with a more paganistic belief system...lots of pagan friends...I am the only one who does not believe in any Gods/goddesses, but of course they don't judge :).  

We focused on what we had in common.  Turned out we both believed in the same things morally.  We agree almost bang on with how to raise children.  I am fine with baptizing them...I was and most of us here were...and well look at us now.  

But look at it this way...you love her.  She was religious when you started to love her and that has not changed.  Does she love you?  Does she accept you for you are...atheism and all?  Religion is the only thing you disagree about, honestly religion rarely comes up in everyday life.  The only thing I had my agree to is when we have kids they do not have to go to church if they do not want to.  

My wife reconciled my lack of belief after about a year.  She loved me...she knew that.  God would not have placed me in her life if there wasn't a reason for it.  

It's not a deal breaker...but both have to be prepaired to comprimise.  You will have to be willing to go to Church sometimes and be willing to have your children(if it gets that far) Baptized.  And She should agree to only teach the children real science...Bible stories are fine as long as they are stories and not given as scientific truths."

psychicsword,PoliticalDiscussion,1389733309.0,Well the problem is that freedom of speech only goes so far. For instance freedom of speech didnt protect the makers of the 3D printed gun designs from them being allowed to continue distributing it. The biggest problem is that if there was something that they didn't want you to know that is happening in a different country they could just block it from being accessible. They could block the pirate bay because they own all the wires by claiming or showing that your speech or actions were actually illegal. Effectively you are giving the government the ability to turn the US's internet into China's great firewall of china Internet over a very long period of time.

It's good stuff to know anyway, so you don't ever find yourself falling into a bad situation.

Most relationships don't start out abusive- most of them start out great.  There might be redflags- but ones that are only really red flags in retrospect (like, they could have just as easily been not a big deal).  Maybe he's a bit jealous or maybe a bit protective or asks to look through your phone or talks shit about your friends once or twice or maybe he gets a little angrier than most people when someone contradicts him but otherwise he's great so you compromise because *you know that relationships require compromise*.  Then one day it's a little bit worse- maybe he makes a bit of a scene because he saw some guy flirting with you and he blamed you in the moment but later he said he was sorry and you *know* he's a good guy so you forgive him.  That's where the cycle comes into play.  Episode -&gt; Big display of regret and sorrow -&gt; Period of calm -&gt; Episode.  Maybe at first the periods of calm are so long that you forget about prior episodes.  But over time the cycle shortens and the episodes get more and more severe but by then you're being gaslit and you've accepted this all as normal because it crept up on you- sort of like getting on the scale one day and realizing that you gained 15 pounds and didn't notice.  You've gotten used to it, you've gotten good at coping.  And probably by then it's hard to get out.  You feel responsible, he's threatening to hurt himself if you leave, your finances are tied up, you have kids together, he's isolated you from your support network whatever.  Marriage might make it more complicated but this happens outside of marriage too.

On that day, I took 600mg of ibuprofen, and I think 10mg of Xanax from my personal prescription to deal with the anxiety. I had my boyfriend come into the appointment with me, which my doctor was totally fine with; she told him to talk to me and keep me distracted. My doc explained that she would do a quick cleaning of my cervix, and then freeze with with lidocaine (she even asked if I'd ever had a reaction to novacaine or lidocaine in the past). The first shot of freezing is all that hurt, and it was a fair bit of pain for about 10 seconds. Then, nothing. I didn't feel a thing. Altogether, the speculum was in for less than 5 minutes. I got up, walked out of the office, and went grocery shopping.

I had the IUD inserted on the 6th day of my period; previously I'd been taking Alesse. I bled a little bit, probably about the same flow as a usual period for me, for another week. Then 2 weeks of no bleeding, then 3 weeks of spotting (annoying, totally, but apparently normal). Since then I've had a fairly regular 5 week cycle, with very little spotting in between, and only occasional light cramping. 

Honestly, getting the Mirena has been the best, and easiest decision I've ever made to take charge of my health and birth control. I'm so happy that I did it! "

Are you serious? You just said it's ""stupid"" that someone would secretly hate the people they live with, yet it's one of the central premises of feminism with regards to men. Looks like you're frantically backpedalling now that I've pointed this out. 

I never said that *you* believed *all* men are misogynist or no woman misandrist, if you paid attention all I said was ""*feminists* believe *most* men are misogynist"".


&gt;That you called ""feminism"" out on hating men, I said that's not true, **and I would know because I am in a far better position to know than you are.**

By virtue of what? As far as I'm concerned, a person outside of a cult has a more objective view on the cult than its members. 

I could say you're blinded by your privilege, but I don't really believe in that shit. But at least it may help you to understand why an ideological opponent who believes that women are actually *advantaged* has no reason to take you at your word.

&gt;and then you called ""feminism"" out on hating men again?

All I did was pointing out that your argument that people can't live together and hate each other at the same time is bunk by pointing to feminist beliefs. You even admitted it:  ""I do know that men have girlfriends, daughters and mothers. And some of those men look down on women for being women."", contradicting yourself.

So your original argument against me ""feminists can't hate men because they live with them"" falls down.

Th3Gr3atDan3,gallifrey,1389734514.0,"They should have kept Lake Silencio a fixed point. It works completely. From a viewer stand point, regenerations are always treated somewhat like a death, and most humans in show are shocked when he changes faces. So technically, he still ""dies"" at Lake Silencio. The thematic arc of Season 6 was that it was inescapable. That certain things are destiny. That is really the only change that needed to happen to Season 6, Eleven still dies, but regenerates. If they wanted to keep the suspense, they could just make him regenerate later on the boat, as with McGann/8. If they really wanted to keep the Tesselector, they could have used it to drive home the point of emotion and loneliness.

Imagine: The Wedding of River Song remains exactly the same. The Doctor thinks he has been clever and is inside the Tesselector, so River goes through with it and shoots him. Except this time instead of flashing to inside the Tesselector with the Doctor waving, we flash to inside the Tesselector and see that it did not work, and miniature Doctor is killed just the same. River thinks the plan worked, that he is still alive. But really the Doctor dies all alone, seeing the futility of his actions to change a fixed point. Just as he is about to die, he sees a crack on the wall. He does not know who is on the other side, but he wants to have some company, any company when he dies. When he tries to communicate, it is revealed Gallifrey is on the other side, and he gets a new set of regenerations, just like TotD. Amy and Rory both think he is dead and never find out differently. The 50th still happens all the same only with Capaldi instead."

MisterScalawag,Indiana,1389734535.0,"&gt; You can do all sorts of selfish things. But pursuing such behavior is incredibly destructive to our society. You've basically turned sexuality into a drug habit.

In what way is this destructive to our society? What if the two people having sex 5x a day are married?

&gt; Then what is the point? 

That isn't up to you or me to decide what the point of a marriage between two people that decide not to have kids is. The only people that get to decide this is those two people.

&gt; Why do we need to regulate a sexual relationship between two people? 

You are assuming that the two people married are going to have sex. Two people that are asexual could get married because they are in love, and that love has nothing to do with sex. Again it isn't you or the governments decision what they do.

&gt; Why does the government care?

How old are you? I guess I incorrectly assumed that you were married. The government takes care (I guess you could call that care) of the legal side of the rights given to people of married status. Like tax incentives, power of attorney, visitation, etc.

&gt;  Yeah, and the NFL isn't only expressed by football.

Who are you to decide how a person's marriage and person love is manifested in the relationship?


This is the whole problem. Gay couples are fighting for marriage because it is an inequality in our society. The couples are not given the same rights as a heterosexual couple, and they want those same rights as any other heterosexual couple is given by default. If John Doe is in the hospital dying, his boyfriend isn't allowed to see him or make any decisions about the treatment that he receives it falls on his parents or the next closest relative even though they might not have any idea about what John wants. When in the case of a married heterosexual couple the wife or husband is allowed to visit and can make decisions on the other person's behalf."
octopushug,relationship_advice,1389734539.0,"They had been arguing for a month prior to Christmas. It sounds a little more like his gf is also seriously considering if she's willing to stick around with OP. Imagine finding out someone cheated on you and hid that fact from you for years--she is probably going through every aspect of their life together trying to see if they're truly compatible and in this distressed situation, the supposedly impersonal gifts didn't help.

If it weren't for all these issues, I might be more inclined to agree with you and say she was merely overreacting after expecting a much bigger surprise. If marriage hadn't been seriously discussed in terms of timing and expectations, an engagement ring is usually *not a good idea*. With the number of serious relationship/trust problems they seem to be having, marriage being on the table sets off alarm bells. 
&gt;I think both of us are more afraid of how a couple living together for 2+ years goes about splitting the items in the house in the event of a break-up. I'm also embarrassed to admit to anyone that after trying multiple times to get back together that it has again failed.

OP sounds like he's already thrown in the towel but would be a lot more enthusiastic about breaking up if it was quick and easy, and he didn't have to feel embarrassed about other people judging him. He's talking about the natural dissolution of the relationship because things aren't happy-go-lucky anymore and seems to be unable to communicate clearly with his gf. I would hesitate to call that marriage mentality and would highly discourage him getting any grand ideas about fixing the relationship using this route."

As a start, tell yourself, ""I'm not the kind of person that drinks soda because soda is bad"".

The next time you find yourself reaching for a soda, tell yourself, ""I'm not the kind of person that drinks soda"", and try a glass of water instead or some tea or something else.  Realize that you won't be perfect, but give yourself a big pat on the back for the progress you do make.

If you are brave you can try to check out the games based on [The Dark Eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Eye#Video_games) ruleset (excluding Satinav and Memoria which are point and click adventures). The Drakensang games are closest to a Dragon Age Origins style (but don't expect the same kind of depth of characters). Compared to many other games here they do usually/often have a party based system (aka the Drakensang games and the Realms of Arkania games do). 

There are also the [Gothic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(series\)) series of games. (no party here from what I remember)

The new ShadowRun Returns is kinda fun as are the old Fallout Games. 

If you can take older games, Arcanum and Temple of Elemental Evil are two games whose names get thrown around a lot, you can get them on GOG. There's also Inquistor, a contemporary indie game made in the old isometric style. It's a bit on the clunky side, but maybe check it out if the lore aspect appeals to you at all. Note comparatively limited visual customization of your character and no party. 

Other than that, just wait a while for all those lovely Kickstarter RPGs that pay homage to the old isometric RPGs are finished (again, I recommend Vampire the Masquerade to tide you over). "

I think it's because so much of the lower gore is on breast tissue, it spreads the pressure out and if the top of the gore digs in too much I use a cotton ball underneath of it. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and have ignored 'discomfort' before and had the top of the underwire actually dig through my skin once and have gotten bruises a bunch of times, neither of which hurt too badly while it was happening but it made it really uncomfortable to try to put a bra on the next day.

My wireless solution is actually a much too-small Parfait Jeanie that I took the wires out of, and it works pretty well, provided that I wear a shirt that works with how much the top of the cup is digging in. (I could definitely size up in the cup, but this was a semi-free solution since that bra was a leftover from when my boobs were smaller)

I actually just picked up a Kris Line moulded pushup in a recent Zulily sale, and the gore doesn't tack at all, and it's pretty comfortable. The amount of padding is a little excessive and not removeable (I have another Kris Line plunge as well, which is seamed/padding with removeable padding like an Ewa bra, so I was kind of expecting this to be the same) overall I'd buy a second one at a similar price though.

I'm thinking of trying to sew my own unpadded bras to wear around the house (and maybe out if they look okay). I'm in love with the Fortnight longlines, but they don't come in anything approaching my size and are pretty pricey.

kowalski71,TrueAskReddit,1389735156.0,"(No tl;dr but the paragraph that most directly answers the question is in bold.)

I recently had some interesting conversations about things like judgment (between us humans, not from god) and justification with a friend who's very religious. Essentially, she was judging someone for their lifestyle choices and I was judging her for judging them. We both knew who each of us were judging and I was struggling intently with the conflict between my moral objection to her judgment and my moral efforts to not judge other people.

We got into moral codes and she was blown away when I said I didn't have one. I told her that each and every decision was an opportunity to do good and bad and I had to carefully consider each one to live a good life. This seriously blew her mind that I didn't have some pre-ordained moral code. She's the first to admit to having led a very sheltered life and apparently she had never talked in depth to someone with this attitude.

**What I realized at the end of the day is my friend thought that an atheist would be less 'good' or moral because there's no higher power to judge their actions. As I watched her and other religious friends hate the gays, judge people for all kinds of life choices, and generally maintain a harmless but definite holier-than-thou attitude I realized that I'm more moral than them because I have no one to *condone* my actions. No religious or moral code tells me when it's okay to do wrong and my mistakes and failings haunt me.**

Finally, my friend pointed out that everyone judges and  I couldn't disagree. My only response was, ""Yes but some people *try* not to."" I told her that while she casually dismissed someone entirely for their temporary lifestyle, I *still* morally struggle with the fact that I judged her for that.

I'm sorry if this comes across as arrogant, I'm certainly not a morally perfect person. I've simply conveyed what was and is going through my head. This is certainly a very specific anecdote and I know some horrible atheists and some saintly religious folk but that's at least one reason why people might not see the good and moral sides of religion as the only side."

I think it might be ""okay"" if the person who died has a written statement saying the person can have sex with their dead body. I don't think its okay to just go around digging people up and having sex with them, it doesn't really cause victims but its a respect issue.


I support gay marriage because it falls under my belief that two consenting adults should be able to do whatever they want as long as it doesn't harm a third party. (I also believe that an individual should be allowed to do anything they want or to themselves as long as it doesn't harm a second or third party. But thats not really relevant here.)

&gt; You support gay marriage because it makes them happy and doesn't hurt anyone? Then why not support Tim over there fuckig a pig?

I'm not exactly sure I can give you an answer here that will make you happy. Gay marriage is two consenting people. Tim fucking a pig isn't going to make that pig happy, and it very well might hurt the pig. And thats ignoring the fact that the pig can't consent. But if I bring up consent you are just going to go back to the stuff you listed before.

It just is different. People are people, whether gay or straight or bi or pan, and can express their emotions. When you have sex with an animal they can't express what they feel or want so you are always taking advantage of it; they are not sentient beings. So that does mean that we are taking advantage of cows when we eat them, I'm not going to deny that. You could do nothing, and just accept that you take advantage of cows/chicken/etc and most people would. I'm not here to say whether that is right or wrong. Or you could do it in a friendlier way like raising your own food; then once you kill the animal, you thank it for its sacrifice and giving its life for you."

predalienmack,Chargers,1389736073.0,"My thoughts: 

We need CBs big time! Surprisingly, our safeties are looking pretty solid at this point, with Addae playing really well down the stretch at the SS spot and Stuckey playing well enough as a backup when he wasn't killing it on special teams. I get the feeling Gilchrist will rotate with Steve Williams (the 5th round CB that we drafted last year that ended up on IR) as our nickel in-the-box safety/slot CB next year, but that still leaves the outside spots to be filled (Wright might be a serviceable CB #2 if he proves to be more consistent with starting experience under his belt). A CB in the first round is pretty much a must, even if we sign a high profile free agent CB like Brent Grimes or Vontae Davis as well.

Our Dline looked awful this year (even Luiget, but I wouldn't say it's time to give up on him after one bad year aside from his rookie season), so I suspect that might garner a second or third rounder out of us (either DE or DT). Whichever of those two picks we don't use on the Dline, we should use at ILB (especially if we don't resign Butler) or OLB (Johnson and Freeney are getting really old and Ingram is really the only other start-worthy OLB on the team at this point, though I'm crossing my fingers for Tourek Williams to turn into something solid).

In the case that there aren't enough solid options to fit our scheme at LB/Dline in the second or third round, we could always use a guard, tackle, or center to develop or start, particularly if Rinehart isn't resigned and/or if Clary is released. 

I think the mid to late round picks should focus on positions where we need depth, in this order: CB, LB, RB, WR. I don't think WR is a high priority position because we have depth (albeit injury-prone depth) at WR, and the scheme we'll continue to run (even without Whiz) is focused on quick, high percentage passes that just require solid route running by the WR corps, and not necessarily the playmaking ability that KA or an early round pick at WR will have. 

But, this is all a moot point because TT has said before that he's really big on drafting the best player available and not drafting purely based on need. "

aggieboy12,saplings,1389736347.0,"Usually when you fire clay, the temperature needs to reach about 2000 F to fully dry and harden into something sturdy. I don't think sticking play-doh in the oven for an hour will do anything more than give you a mound of hot, cracked rocks. It would be useless. What I would suggest is that if you have any friends in ceramics (I assume that if your school has a wood-shop, it also has a ceramics room), ask them to make you a small bowl without a carb or any holes for the stem. Basically just a little ceramic thimble with dimensions a little larger than you want for the final product. Have him fire it, and then, when you get it back from him, you can drill a hole for the stem. The carb isn't really that important for a good bowl, it just makes sure that you get every last bit of smoke. Also, if you want the bowl to look extra cool, you can have your friend glaze it with whichever color you want. This is basically applying a layer of sand and certain metals which, when refired, will turn into colored glass. If you do that, you will not need to season with honey or do a pre-burn. All in all, it would probably not take him more than about a week-week and a half."

marcm6246,gainit,1389737158.0,"I know that feel, I just got out of the same boat as you. I started looking into /r/gainit and the FAQ back in *June*. Only got serious about starting a program in October, but I got wayyyyy too distracted with analyzing every detail that I entered analysis paralysis. Spent the past 3 months asking very similar questions like yours, got varying answers, and it only pushed me further into a state of confusion. 

Here's the bottom line, if you're eating more, that's better than what you were before. The main things are calories and protein. Consume 500 above your TDEE per day, I got seriously overwhelmed with this, thought it was impossible/a ton of food. It really isn't, 1 tablespoon of olive oil is 120 calories, only 1 tablespoon! I can add that to anything 5 times a day and there's my surplus. 

Protein was the other overwhelming factor. For me I have to consume 135 grams a day, that looked like a crap ton to me. Got even more overwhelmed about this than the calories. But then I realized that I could just mix I scoop of whey with some water and chug that down, easy 20-30 grams right there (depending on what brand you use), if by the end of the day I didn't meet my protein goal with solid food. Both are pretty manageable now. 

Fat and carbs are important too, but don't get caught up trying to create an even exact 30/30/40 out of all 3 macros. Get those calories in, that protein and the carbs and fats come with them usually. 

Whatever you'll be eating now will be twice as better as what you were eating while still skinny, progress!!

To quote Jordin Sparks - Just take it one step at a time, there's no need to rush. Start with making sure you're eating the right amounts of protein and calories. Then go to the gym and hit the weights. Go to sleep, hey that wasn't too bad was it??

You can do it! I started starting strength today after 3 months in your shoes and I finally have clarity because I stopped being so precise, analysis paralysis really kills you."

James_GAF,DebateaCommunist,1389737565.0,"I wouldn't necessarily say those were completely communist societies in pre-history. It seems likely there was a social hierarchy as we see in nature with say chimps, gorillas, lions, wolves and pretty much all other social animal groups. More or less tribal, which in many ways resembles communism though often are not classless societies.

Dominance seeking in social circles can lead to run away hierarchy. Warring tribes conquering others, while those at the top of the hierarchy gain power through violent domination. Carried out over time city states, then states and empires arise with the social dominant individuals at the head of the hierarchy. Rival hierarchies form and do war with others and carried out over a long enough time line we get something resembling the modern world organizationally. 

Unraveling that hierarchy to flatten the classes is a daunting task. Were it ever achieved the stability of that system is directly related to how unified the society is I believe. The more fractured, disparate and stressed the more prone to factional largely localized hierarchies of gang, mob, tribe. Basically, global communism with scarcity near universally solved would seem the most stable.

However, dominance seeking individuals always represent a threat to flat and classless societies. Grouped together in greedy pursuits such people can be quite disruptive to collaborative egalitarian social structures. It's always going to be up to the cooperators to limit the disruptive to maintain something like that. Unfortunately, that balance seems difficult to attain without considerable oppression and incarceration. Keeping narcisists, sociopaths, etc. from destroying relative equality is not an easy task."

""Getting a girl"" is not an award you're presented with for being a certain type of human being. It's not like there is some justice-minded Sex Santa walking around College Town USA handing out perfect 8s to frat boys because they won the ""getting a girl"" contest. 

&gt;our white knight is eagerly waiting on the front porch waiting for Becca to arrive. He got there early so he wouldn't miss. An hour and half into it, she finally shows up. 

He lurked in the entrance of a party, waiting for a girl he met a month ago, for an hour and a half. Jesus. Our protagonist is gonna attract some bulls with all those red flags. 

&gt;He makes a beeline to her and asks if she wants a drink. Despite how nice he is being and all the compliments about how nice she looks tonight, she seems disinterested. Maybe something is wrong. Maybe our white knight did something to upset.

Maybe our white knight started treating a house party like a romantic date for two the minute his acquaintance of a month, who has turned him down on several dates, arrived. 

&gt;""Shit"" he says to himself. ""Are you okay?"" he asks to Becca. ""Did I do something to upset you?"" ""I'm fine"" she says, acting even more disinterested. 

You know, at least I appreciate the character development here. Becca has been established as a character who has difficulty acting assertive (see how often she was ""busy"") and it's consistent that she wouldn't be able to tell him how possessive he's acting. 

&gt;Before our white knight can continue trying to fix the situation with his crush, Gary and a couple of his frat bros show up like they own the place.

Those assholes didn't even wait the prerequisite hour and a half before entering the house party! Sex Santa gonna be mad tonight! 

&gt;""John will be pissed, these guys are acting like assholes"" says the white knight to himself. John being the owner of the house and the white knight's good friend. Meanwhile, Gary sees John and the two exchange pleasantries and bro hug. John wouldn't be friends with this asshole. ""Hey guys, Gary is here, this dude is the man!"" John says.

What's this? Douchebag Gary is established to be well-liked by a third party in the story. A male third party, who is on good terms with our protagonist! I know this might sound a little crazy, ladies, but something makes me wonder if we're dealing with an unreliable narrator!

&gt;The white knight is saddened, he didn't get this warm welcome when he showed up, but then again he got here when they were still bringing in the beer and setting up. Can't miss Becca!

See, hanging out in front of a party waiting for your crush of one month to show up is bad for the rest of your social life, too. 

&gt;At least Becca's mood has picked up visibly. Yet know she is hanging near Gary as he talks about how wild last weekend got with some of his guy friends. Gary says ""Yo Becca, you got mad wasted Saturday, you were such a fucking mess."" What a dick. Becca won't stand for that shit. Why does this guy think he can be so rude to her. Like she doesn't feel bad enough for getting sick and puking! ""Oh my gawd, I totally was! You're so funny!"" ""What?"" says the white knight as Gary turns back to his bros and continues his story while Becca tries to get Gary's attention.

So Becca is revealed to be remorseless about her extreme levels of inebriation, something our protagonist clearly looks down upon. Maybe this is when he realizes that this pretty party girl is not his type and moves on? Who am I kidding!

&gt;The white knight thinks about grabbing her arm but knows she wouldn't like that

NO SHIT SHERLOCK. That sentence should read ""The white knight thinks about grabbing her arm, but he *knows it's inappropriate to aggressively touch a female acquaintance who he has known for a month*. 

&gt;so instead he just says ""hey Becca,"" a few times to the back of her shoulder.

[Trying to imagine someone actually doing this.](http://i.imgur.com/rHF8K.gif)

&gt;The white knight goes outside, hoping Becca will follow after he says loudly ""I need to go outside.""

Wat.

&gt;""Hey have you guys seen Becca?"" ""Idk man, I think she went upstairs."" Oh no. Maybe she got sick again, she is constantly talking with her friends about drinking every weekend,

You've known this girl for a month, she constantly talks about getting wasted with her friends, and you've decided she's the type of girl who, and I quote, ""She 's smart and nice and pretty and an all around good girl. She is proof you don't have to be some alpha frat bro to get a girl.""? Like, I'm not judging Becca or anything, but she's clearly not the person you think she is, protagonist dude. 

&gt;World shattered as he walks back to his dorm, the RedPiller's comment comes back to the white knight like a lightning bolt. He can't deny it anymore. They were right. Not just right, but resoundingly so. He was blind and they were simply trying to help him see.

""Oh my god, they were right! Mel Gibson *shouldn't* have paid alimony! This is is the most important realization of my life!""

Neebat,worldnews,1389737685.0,"You get it!  And that's an interesting proposal that's basically consistent with the goal, but I want to be clear that the goal remains the same even if any given proposal turns out to be unworkable.  Personally, I'm deeply suspicious of letting the government decide who gets the royalties.  Though in theory, if they're really honest about using statistics to make the calculation, it might not suck.

I really want to emphasize that **the goal, decoupling distribution and royalties, is more important** than how we accomplish it.  We can spend all year haggling about the implementation so long as we agree that limited distribution is no longer a viable part of copyright.

Here's my proposal:

1.  A small income or sales tax which goes straight to a sponsorship for the arts.  The National Endowment for the Arts in the US already does this sort of thing, but I'd be expanding their income and visibility about 1000 times over.
2.  Allow people to opt out of the tax by contributing directly to the content creators of their choice.

So, say you're the guy who really loved the movie Gigli.  It changed your life and you owe your success to its greatness.  You want to encourage them to make more movies like that.  You could send money directly to Benifer and get a receipt.  A receipt for $1000 means you're exempt from $1000 of arts tax.

AGAIN, I want to emphasize this proposal is just a possible implementation, and I'd love to see a better one.  This isn't even a complete proposal.  It's just one idea.

Edit:  Lots of people deeply distrust the NEA and they'd HATE to hand them billions of dollars in new funding, and that's a deliberate feature of this plan.  You don't have to give your money to the NEA, it's just a default if you don't give it to the artists you consider most deserving.  We want people to pause and consider how much Gigli or any other artwork means to them.  If not, some bureaucrats are going to piss away your money, literally, on performance art or something equally goofy."

* There's 2 things to think about regarding wheels: diameter (mm) and softness. Each company has it's own softness rating. Softer wheels will wear out longer and some might argue that one has to be a pretty good skater to use them. Since you're on a ""real"" rink, I would suggest going as soft as you're comfortable getting. It's just like sharpening your skates, you'll get a feel for it. If you have brand new skates, use the same diameter wheels as what comes with them. As a vet inline player I use (front to back) 76mm78mm82mm80mm. That means there are only 3 wheels on the ground. I think this was called the ""rocker"" setup. I would suggest at least giving yourself a gradient smaller diameter --&gt; larger diameter

Nah, the easiest way to make friends as an adult is through your existing friends. As long as you have a decent group of friends making new friends organically is easy.

&gt; As an adult who's just moved house, you can knock on your neighbour's doors and introduce yourself, or ask your colleagues at your new job to help you to get acquainted with the area, and you can invite a whole bunch of them over for a housewarming.

My neighbors (apartment building in the bad part of town) are: An Arab couple that are always yelling at each other, a paranoid Finnish woman with approximately 37 locks on her door, some guy who's like 93 years old and only leaves his apartment to go grocery shopping, a Persian family of nine or so who will every now and then have big arguments in the stairwell and some generally sketchy fuckers living right above me.

So, neighbors are kind of out of the question.

Coworkers then? I have three. One describes himself as an introverted gamer who lives with his girlfriend and pretty much spends his days working or gaming, my other coworker doesn't drink or party and once described his life as only containing work, sleep, eating and gaming/watching TV. Finally my boss, he's a family man who lives in the next town over, decent guy but not exactly a party animal at this stage of his life (and constantly stressed out about work, picking up kids at daycare and all that stuff).

&gt;In an effort to gain some privacy and relief from the expectations of &gt;always pulling out the big win, the guys agreed to change their names &gt;as they pursued their NHL dreams.
&gt;
&gt;Charlie Conway, the stalwart leader who always seemed to find a way to &gt;win, continued his winning ways after changing his name to Mike &gt;Richards and resettling in Canada. Championship victories in the OHL, &gt;CHL, and AHL were followed up by a Stanley Cup in the NHL and &gt;Olympic Gold with the Canadian team.
&gt;
&gt;Adam Banks also felt the need to change his nationality to really &gt;complete the disguise and so became Evgeni Malkin from Russia. He has &gt;continued to use his stellar skills to put up impressive numbers and win &gt;big games.
&gt;
&gt;Dean Portman used his strength and badass mentality to forge a solid &gt;NHL career in his own right after he became Aaron Asham.

&gt;As Luis Mendoza grew into himself, he became bigger and heavier while &gt;losing the speed that was his hallmark. He was able to use his size and &gt;size and gritty play however to realize an NHL dream as Raffi Torres."

Of that 45%, 85% used a dorsal penile nerve block, which doesn't block all the pain, as shown in Lander study in 1997. Babies with dorsal penile nerve blocks still showed signs of quite a bit of pain.

Something no one tells you, though, is that pregnancy hormones are designed to make you happy about being pregnant.

However for a newbie, it makes ordering easy, and you'd have a hard time accidentally getting something too hoppy or weird, because they just don't make those kinds of beers.

Oktoberfest is a blast, although it's touristy as hell.  You might want to consider another beer fest for a more authentic experience.  Stuttgart's ""Canstatter Volksfest"" is the second-biggest beer fest in Germany, but the vast majority of attendees are Germans, not frat boys."

&gt;VAWA does not discriminate against men.

Bullshit. It specifically provides for women's only shelters and forbids men's (or rather, excludes shelters who accept men from the financing).


&gt;It just has women in the name because domestic violence is the kind of violence women most frequently face.

Yeah well, good for women. Men suffer from so much more violence that the ""domestic"" part is a drop in the bucket, even though they suffer DV in roughly the same numbers as women. 

Even if men were subject to far less DV than women, it would not justify the discrimination.

girlaboutoaktown,AskMen,1389739042.0,"Dajbmann22 has it right.  A lot of Europeans, particularly Germans, have a view of American beer as being crap because they have only had U.S. Budwieser or Miller or something.   Then again, Beck's is the #1 mass produced beer in Germany and it's far from great.  But what you have here are what you'd call microbrews in the U.S., basically regional breweries, which sounds really exciting, except that for the most part, outside of Bavaria, they're all making the same few basic kinds of beers.  There's a ton of variety in brands, but not a lot of variety in flavor.

Whereas the U.S. is a playground for the beer snob, because our microbrews are amazingly diverse and you can get them in any decent-sized city in the U.S.  But I should say that there are other places in Europe that are better off than Germany in beer diversity.  The Danes have a huge variety of crazy craft brews for such a small country, for example.  Even France and Italy are producing some cool brews.  But you have to seek out those types of beers here.  If you just go into a regular bar, you'll have the same basic choices, and it's boring and sad."

I imagine he was hurting a little because he just coiled up and was totally uninterested in the rat after that point.  However the rat could tell and then went on the offensive.  The rat would probe around my python to see what it would do and I was curious as to what was going on and wished Sir David Attenborough was by my side to give commentary.  Anyway the rat made his move and I quickly pulled him off because it would have been a shame for the rat to put a blemish on the striking pattern that my snake had.

I find it interesting how the article points out the different cultural directions Denmark and Norway had after 1814, Denmark had to come to terms with the fact we were no longer a regional power - in fact we were not a power at all - and we finally did in 1864, of course. Meanwhile Norway had to reinvent themselves after centuries of Danish rule and influence. Both nations had to separate themselves from the other culturally.

Some of it (and in Chassidism in general) treats Rebbes in a way that seems downright Shamanistic.

But that's not my main problem.  Most of it is that their general trend of presenting themselves by telegraphing ""we are Orthodoxy"" to Jews who don't know better when in reality they're a tiny piece of it.  I've seen them say stuff like ""this is how Judaism davens"" when it's some weird part of their liturgy.  Also, this is Chassidism in general, but I *really* don't like that they object to MO and Conservadox changing traditions when their forerunners essentially rewrote their liturgy in the way they felt like.

See the things I just wrote?  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  The oldest known symbolic representation goes back at least [80,000 years!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BBC-artefacts.jpg)

Every single human being that is alive today, with the possible exception of feral children, uses symbols on a daily basis.  Letters are symbols.  Mathematical variables (and operators, etc.) are symbols.  Hell, even words (spoken or written) are symbols!

Symbols allow for levels of abstraction.  Without this, I can't even think.  A first level of symbols represents basic things (me, water, food, earth, etc.).  Higher levels develop more abstract concepts based on lower levels (love, spirit, etc.).

Whether or not you consider them ""technolgy"" per se, symbols are some of the most basic and important things that humans have ever developed."

linuxlass,exchristian,1389739514.0,"Sorry, I wasn't clear. The phrase ""believe in belief"" has a more specific meaning than the way you used it. The ""belief"" that is being believed in is a kind of wishy-washy, emotional sort of idea. These people tend to say that atheists ""don't believe in anything"".

It's about religion, or ""spirituality"" as a feeling, rather than the kind of belief you need for imagination to lead you to creating something real. They would rather you believe in astrology, in faith-healing, in the power of ""ionic water"", in dowsing rods, rather than have you be atheist or a skeptic. Because then, you at least believe in *something*, even if they think it's silly or demonic.

I agree that you need to have belief, you need to have faith, you need to have hope. These things let you make the leap from idea to reality, they let you take the risk of loving someone, of having a baby, of giving up bad habits, all sorts of things.

But this kind of belief is ultimately grounded in reality, and you readily admit that you are bound by the laws of nature."

There are some differences, but it has less to do with people getting old and lame and more to do with more experienced drinking. Sure when you're in your early 20's lots more people get super drunk and pass out due to not knowing their alcohol tolerance.

When my friends have a party there is heavy drinking. People get drunk and wild. There is still nudity, sex, and drinking games going on. There is a mix of age groups. We got 20 year olds, we got 20 year olds with kids, we got 50 year olds and everything in between. Everyone gets along and just wants to drink and cut loose on a Sat night.

I went to a party in Dec that was at an indoor heated pool where everyone got naked , there was a live DJ and massage therapist and weed and plenty of booze.

The problem I have with people isn't that they slow down as they get old, it's that when they do get an opportunity to do something fun and wild they don't take it. Say ""yes"" on occasion even when you are 50. Do it just because the soul needs it."

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389740151.0,"&gt; Video games tell a story, just like how a movie or a book tells a story. Historically speaking, most of the recurring themes in storytelling, no matter what medium the story is told in (oral, print, digital) have remained static since Gilgamesh.

Look at an action movie from the 1950s, one from the 1980s and one from now. Many things stay the same, but at the same time plenty of things change and usually the portaryal of women in movies does change as how women are in society changes. 

Note that I'm not saying they are getting better, but they adapt to how society changes. So the argument ""well that's how it was in Gilgamesh/back when knights were around"" doesn't really work because society and stories do adapt. This isn't even a philosophical question of ""should stories change"" when theyy obviously change, just look at books and look at movies. Why would video games the one thing that doesn't. 

Personally, I agree with you about La Noire and really any game that takes realism halfway serious =&gt; the problem is in the overall scheme of things, very few games actually do. So we can envision giant monsters and magical spells and regenerating health but we can't imagine women having different roles? [and to be fair, many fantasy games do, but that's why it sticks out when some games don't]

&gt;Why is this not a criticism in movies? 

Actually it totally is. From ""why do the best paid lead actresses get paid so much less than the male lead actors"" to precisely what you talk about about female starring action movies to ""why not more female directors/oscar nominees in directing"". Google around, there's endless discussion of it. 

&gt;Not very many I can think of off the top of my head, and least not any real big budget films.

Well there is Hunger Games now :p And Alien. And arguably Terminator 2. But yes, it's roughly as rare as video games starring women. ;) 

(for the record, I'm actually not a huge fan of female or male lead characters, I'm more team silent protagonist who you then customize or having a choice of either male or female, even if that means weaker stories) 

I think if there's an idea at the core of this entire discussion then it's actually a discussion about target audience. Men actually do prefer male lead characters in a lot of situations and a lot of women prefer playing female. In fact, there's evidence to suggest that women actually prefer it even more strongly than men do. This could be because men are more likely to be visual oriented so them playing a woman and hence getting to see a pretty woman gives them a ""replacement pleasure"" (as opposed to the identification/admiration pleasure of playing a dude) like in the famous ""well whose ass would you prefer looking at for 60+ hours"" argument, but women get less visual pleasure out of playing a dude because they are less likely to be as heavily wired in that regard (or the male characters would have to be heavily tweaked to fit female tastes more). If we look at characters as one of the core ways to access a game then consistently doing characters that don't fit the tastes of female players that puts female players at a disadvantage in finding the game equally fun/the game equally pushing their buttons in some areas. 

That's usually when people bring up the ""women don't like games anyway/well women play less games"" argument. Which imo tends to be complicated because if you look around, a lot of the most best selling titles like The Sims or World of Warcraft were probably pushed to that point because they were also capable of being appealing to women. So to just completely throw them out as potential customers/target audiences seems pretty disrespectful to me. Very ""sorry, your money has cooties/your money isn't good enough"" which, I would argue, is no small insult in a capitalistic minded world as ours. To have a market oriented world and saying ""you are not good enough to be marketed to"". "

Sir-douche-a-lot,gainit,1389741373.0,"Hey The-Hell, immediately go to a doctor.

I started lifting some time ago, and deadlifts became my absolute favorite excercise. I was doing them twice a week, with great success, reaching a 285lb deadlift for 10 reps and three sets. I was kicking ass deadlifting (supposedly with good form).

Until about November, when after a very intense deadlift workout my lower back was killing me. I layed down for a while and was able to complete my workout. I rested for about 30 minutes and went to play some tennis, where the pain started to destroy me and I had to lay on the court on my back every few points.

I went to the doctor about two days after that and he told me I suffered an injury in my lower back (if you get back to me tomorrow, I can specify exactly what happened because I don't have the MRI results, my mom has them back home), and told me I couldn't deadlift anymore because I was going to keep hurting myself even with perfect form.

I decided on friday of last week to go for it. Do low weight, perfect form deadlifts. Terrible idea. I re-injured myself. I'm having trouble laying on my back going to sleep. I've been in pain and I most likely will have to go back to the doctor.

My only advice is, don't play around with your lower back. It's sensitive, fragile and you have no idea how much you rely on it until you're injured.

No in app purchase using any official methods, just straight up asks for your credit card number.

&gt;Apparently with the full version you get a 2 Terabyte storage drive at no extra cost! It's only $0.99! What a bargain! You also get more onboard storage, unlock faster processing power, and more ram! Amazing!

Remember:

* **You can still stealth.**  Makes it useful to always get the jump and not waste time killing through packs you don't need.  With the Sawbones skill to give you Upper Hand out of stealth (Smuggled Med Delivery, tier 7 Sawbones tree), it is awesome and gives you tons of DPS output on mob packs with Blaster Volley.  Popping out of stealth with 2x Blaster Volley / Thermal Grenade / Corso's EMP Blast / Corso's Frag Grenade is basically a dead pack of mobs.

* You can still Tranq &amp; Slice Droids (useful on strong mobs with weak packs).

* You can still Shoot First out of stealth/Back Blast while Corso has aggro.

* You still have the Flyby, Blaster Volley, Flash &amp; Thermal Grenade.  Use them!

50-55 went faster on my Sawbones Smuggler than it did on my Guardian specced for DPS."

The lack of extended vacation time and control over my day to day activities gradually wore on me. Add on to that the sedentary lifestyle and that I was on call, though rarely called, every other week. After almost 2 years of that I packed it in and went freelance to regain some control.

Freelance has a number of downsides as well. Client acquisition, relationship building, uninteresting projects, time commitments, phone calls, managing finances and on and on. I'm considering a return to office life at this point or at least finding a steady part-time client which leaves me time to do what I want most of the time.

Maybe a reduction in hours if you can live on it would be beneficial, maybe a flex schedule where you can set working hours some days, some work from home days or 4 day 10hr schedule would suit you better. If your employer is open to any of those you'll have to ask."

I'm not usually too into dream interpretation anymore, but I did go through a phase with it. The symbolism exists, but it's hard for anyone else to interpret except you, the dreamer, because you know your life and how you felt in the dream etc.

I also have vivid and recurring dreams. One time I dreamt that my mom was dying and since people sometimes say INFJs have psychic tendencies, I freaked out thinking I was having a feeling that was actually happening. Called my mom and she was fine.

I agree with you. I'm not saying that the cute concept is foolproof, like a big red button which opens up a hatch in the ceiling where money starts pouring out, I mean that you can't say that it's the fault of the concept. As you point out, A Pink are actually having success with it, which would necessarily mean that there are things that they are doing better. The problem is rather that Secret aren't doing whatever it is that A Pink is doing right. I wouldn't go as far as to say that Secret should just copy A Pink, but they are proof that it is possible today to have success with it."

woollymammothsteak,AskWomen,1389742286.0,"I used Implanon and had it removed after 7 months. The main reasons were that I did not stop bleeding out my damn vagina once for those 7 months I was on it and it was painful to move the skin around that area (I don't know why, but if I pulled on that skin at all in any direction it felt like the implant was stabbing me.)

I truthfully prefer to not be on any birth control at all, but the best one I've tried is NuvaRing. It's pretty great, mostly because you can just get a year's supply at a time and choose to just keep the ring in an extra week and skip your period. I just note when I'm supposed to swap them out, once every four weeks, on my Google calendar. I noticed less side effects with NuvaRing than with the implant, the pill (of which I've tried a handful), and the IUD."

Duffalpha,xboxone,1389742644.0,"I think, in a way, the criticism is legitimate. We invest an insane amount of disposable income into these purchases. Games are often 60, with a new need for DLC. The requisite console is 500+. Since there are so few games available, the cost of that console does have to be considered in the purchase. 

When I am willing to pay someone ~100 dollars, I expect to get what I was promised. $100 is traditionally a very large purchase for many people, and video games seem to be the only industry where we trust the developer to provide value. When they don't it feels deceptive. 

Imagine buying a lego set at full price, only to find that the connector blocks are an extra 5 bucks, and the little lego-men are missing. You would flip a shit. 

Publishers/developers have driven the prices SO HIGH that they really have no excuse for not providing a seamless experience. Companies that release affordable products, or discounted alphas, receive far fewer complaints than say EA who charges $110 to access all of BF4, and they can't even provide sound effects in all their maps. 

I mean what the fuck. 

Imagine spending $100 on all the DVDs of Star Trek only to find out that TNG Season 6 has no sound. 

It would be an outrage. 

If you're sick of the hatred stop letting your marketing department make false promises you can't keep. Stop releasing unfinished products. Start treating the feedback from your viewers with respect. "

Also, with your topic I guess an interest in QCD makes quite a bit of sense; I mostly got into it because I used to live with a guy who didn't understand that I was *not* a particle physicist and had a lot of questions. Then I discovered that the gauge symmetry underlying QCD is beautiful and now I'm going to do the Lattice QCD thing in hopes of finding more beautiful maths!

Also comfort. If you're dressed comfortably, and acting in a way that's comfortable to you, you'll likely pass better.

cluberti,sysadmin,1389743538.0,"Wow - 7200RPM hard disks for VDI?  I'm surprised you got to 20.  Yes, SSDs will help, but only if you are configuring them in a wise way - SSDs are indeed faster, but they're not a silver bullet.  You can get away with 15K SAS drives if you create your storage environment properly.  RAM is usually not your problem, and past boot storms, your CPUs will largely sit below capacity as well - in VDI, it's almost always disks.  In your configuration, it's very obviously your disk I/O performance.

If you're creating arrays to use in a non-persistent environment, you need to make sure the parent disk VHDX is stored on a separate volume on it's own disk array, and any differencing disks for the clients are stored on separate volumes on a different array of disks.  As the environment grows in load, please do not try to cram too many differencing disks on a logical volume, either - it pays to test performance, and create as many volumes for differencing disks as needed to avoid overloading each disk array as well.  If you're creating arrays to use in a persistent environment, the same logic applies as the non-persistent environment with regards to having as many volumes sitting on disk arrays as required, but you don't need a separate volume and array for any parent disks.  If you use SSDs instead of (or as an augment to) your mechanical disk arrays, the same logic applies, but you usually need fewer disks in an array to achieve the same performance as you would need with 15K drives.

Note the above assumes you have a decent storage controller in use as well if this is a DAS configuration, as queue depth can easily become an issue for VDI on DAS storage.  If you're using iSCSI or FC and external storage, consider multiple HBAs to take advantage of MPIO.

TL;DR Yes, it's your hard drives - they're designed to handle the load of one machine, not 20.  If you're going to put desktops on a server (which is what you're doing), you'll need to scale to high-I/O enterprise capacity and use the appropriate disks and array configurations to do so."

- you have to convince me you don't hate men, which tbh would be very hard for me to believe if you adhered to the above theories. Certainly you *saying* you don't hate men would not be sufficient. Why not, you ask. Well, hate is not something people usually advertise, for one. Second, it is likely your hate would be invisible, even to you. If you saw someone spit on a man  for no apparent reason, that would be hateful, right? But what if you believed the man to be a violent unrepentant criminal?

As for money making... I live in Gainesville, FL. My clients are all around Florida and the Southeast (a few in Texas, one in Indiana, and a few North Carolina, too). My cost of living is much lower than DC. If I lived in DC, I'd be charging more money, that's for sure.

I'm around $40k last year. This year is starting out stronger than last, so it could grow beyond that. But that's a comfortable salary for me right now. If I was in a bigger city, I'd be charging higher prices, but since I'm still fairly new, I charge(d) what I'm comfortable with. My first year, I took in around $10,000 for the year and lived just fine on that. But I was also single, had no pets, and never went out.

Some quick advice: don't include cycles for the sake of including cycles. In particular, Oaths of Druids and Ghouls are substantially better than the other three- if you're going for power level, I'd cut the weaker ones.

You'll probably want to beef up your mana fixing. The new scry Temples are reasonably cheap, so probably fit your budget. Even the gates aren't awful. Is there a reason to include the artifact lands? It seems bad to me to let something like Ancient Grudge be potentially devastating if a person leads with two artifact lands if there's no real benefit.

If you plan on supporting aggro, you'll want more 1- and 2-drops in white. There's a bunch of cheap 2-power 1-drops out there to include- you don't need Isamaru, but Elite Vanguard is about as good for substantially less money.

perpetualpenchant,AskWomen,1389744921.0,"&gt; Do you think Green's depiction of a teenage girl is convincing? Do you find the characters authentic, and could you relate to them?


Many people have said that they don’t find the characters authentic. I almost agree with this, but at the same time I do find the characters to be believable. Hazel has been out of school for 3 years, already completed her GED and is taking college classes. She even says she spends most of her time reading. With the amount of time she has at home, I find her voice to be authentic. Augustus doesn’t have quite the same excuse since he is in school, but to me he seems like he tries hard to seem smart, worldly, etc. I definitely remember teenagers like that from high school, so it checks out.


Also, you have to keep in mind, we don’t see all of their interactions. Only the highlights. When Hazel talked about looking at the pictures of them together I realized how much we probably didn’t see. I’m sure there were plenty of less-than-witty conversations over the phone or when they were hanging out doing nothing special.

&gt; Hazel is pretty vocal about how much she hates cancer books. Do you think this book manages to transcend the things about cancer books that annoy her, or that may annoy you?


I like that Green worked to show the grittier side to cancer. The sarcastic narrative, dialogue, and multiple character’s experiences. We were able to see the family dynamics, fear, anger, and sadness that comes with sickness. We also saw via Augustus’ girlfriend that not all cancer patients are brave fighters that never complain like many want to believe.

However, I still felt like the main characters were idealized in a way. Like /u/The_Limit_DNE said, I think it stems from them falling into the smart, witty, “not your typical teenager” characters that have become the norm. They also seem to have a philosophical or existential wisdom because of their experiences with cancer. At times that can place them into the “brave, wise, cancer fighter” archetype."

PcaKestheaod,magicTCG,1389745241.0,"**I'm going to write a wall, but read the first paragraph before you decide to skip it. Not trying to toot my own horn, but this is an area I can help with for sure.**

I used to be REALLY into Yu-Gi-Oh and I played it VERY competitively. Not at a YCS level or anything, but I do think that if I had attended a YCS I'd have given it a run for its money. I had a few original decks that I had posted on youtube and had been featured by 'big name yugitubers' (youtube was how the famous players would put their names out there) and I actually wrote two guides for /r/yugioh which are STILL linked in the side bar of the subreddit.

So when you're looking for an honest discussion comparing the two games, I feel like I'm a pretty good source. Yugioh used to be a big deal to me so I'm going to have a bit of a rant :P

The yugioh banlist is fucked. Completely. It's fucked because Konami doesn't know how to balance their own game, but they realize that powerful cards that will win people games have the ability to sell packs and sets and structure decks. So as a result of those two things, yugioh is forced to deal with this situation where Konami is printing incredibly busted cards, players deal with a situation where two, MAYBE three decks, rule a format and it's really really hard to even take a game off them if you're playing anything below tier 1, and then Konami retroactively fixes their mistake six months later by banning/limiting some cards in those decks, and the cycle repeats. This isn't even opinion. I'll tell you why this is straight up FACT.

At one point, the Six Sams deck was unbeatable. Tier 0. Because Konami went out and decided they'd revive that archetype (nothing wrong with that) and designed some absolutely busted cards. The cards are spoiled, hype train rolls, players build the decks, it snags 14 spots in the top 16 of the next two YCS-es and Konami retroactively bans Shien and Gateway to deal with it. Then next month they print Wind-ups or Chaos dragons or whatever.

And here's how I know power creep is STUPID in yugioh. Maybe a year after the original bans for all of these cards, THEY START UNBANNING THEM. I used to play lightsworns. When I started playing lightsworn, JD was at 2, lumina was at 1, and honest was at 2 (for the MTG players, those are really important cards for a deck and they had heavy restriction on the).

At that point in time, Lightsworn wasn't the best deck, but it was still damn good. Now, unless I'm mistaken, JD and Lumina are both at 3 for the first time since Charge of the Light Brigade was released AND IT ISN'T EVEN A PROBLEM. This was a tier 0 deck. Admittedly there are still some nerfs to the deck overall, but before I had stopped paying attention, it hadn't even top 32-ed an event while having access to these cards. That's crazy.

To your point about the linear quality of the game, you are absolutely correct. It was INCREDIBLY hard to find new synergy that was viable because at least 90% of the cards printed are absolute shit. It's ridiculous. Like, not even remotely useable. 9% of the remaining cards will be legitimately good, and then the remaining 1% will be lucky enough to have synergy years later with a top deck.

It's so hard to have a sense of individuality in Yugioh. I used to go on Dueling Network and search for key words in an attempt to find synergy. And while I really enjoyed that, and while I'm considering digging out my cards again as I'm writing this, that's such terrible design. I can't accurately describe this to the MTG players. You guys don't realize what you have. Breakout tech in yugioh is baisicly unheard of. I remember some guy won a YCS with earth psychics and EVERYONE flipped shit because that was the best a rogue deck had done MAYBE EVER.

Combo in yugs is how 90% of decks will win. Buuuut that does make it really easy to build stun/control/anti-meta. I think my favourite victory was winning locals with a light beat deck in the era of wind-up hand drop (fuck that combo). My favourite deck ever was actually plant synchro (god I miss synchro so much. Is it viable again?) which was awesome, until it got ban hammered out of existence. While not a combo deck in the MTG sense, it created situations where my turn could be 5 minutes long while I play out my hand, make the things that I need, and try to set it up so that was in the safest position possible, etcetc. So this is actually one point where yugs might win vs MTG in my books. 


And now I'm going to add. This is ultimately the reason why MTG is a much better game in my opinion. Everyone says that yugs is cheaper than MTG because there's no rotation of sets. This is the single most incorrect statement about a TCG ever. Pot of Duality, a format staple in EVERY deck was $160 a piece, it was reprinted a year later and later limited to 1. Tour Guide of the Underworld, format staple in 90% of the decks, running more than $300 for a set AND WAS UNUSABLE WITHOUT A SET, later reprinted and limited to 2. Reborn Tengu a card of lesser rarity even, $75 for a set, later limited to 2 and reprinted.

Yugioh is probably ten times more expensive than Magic. You and your friend should get into EDH. It's the most yugioh format in magic.

I guess the point I'm trying to make (poorly) is that this is a two way street. When people invest $60 they expect a product of high quality. 

Additionally, this guy needs to realize that as a salaried employee he is just that: a salaried employee. If he is looking to the fans for admiration as some form of compensation, then he isn't responsibly managing his own career. He works for a large studio, and the criticism of that studio has no reflection on him. 

The internet is an emotionally charged place. If you provide good content you will receive more praise than was thought possible 20 years ago; if you fuck up then you will burn in the flames!

He knows the deal. 

Like good actors only choose good scripts, a good designer should choose good projects/teams. If he is frustrated that he is participating in something that isn't being praised, then he needs to self evaluate and decide whether he needs to move to a better team, or develop the skills needed to be hired onto a better team. 

I agree with the author on the point of hyper-criticism to the point of death threats. That's inappropriate.  More, it's bat shit insane. However, he should probably find his validation in life -- and the drive to create art -- from somewhere other than the internet and it's critics.

I guess I could start with the superficial.  He's smokin hot.  He's got the brightest blue eyes, a great smile, and a really awesome beard.  He's a great cook.  He rolls a good joint despite his gigantic fingers.  He always knows just when ice cream is needed.  He never shames me for my fast food cravings because he's right there craving with me.

He's funny.  He's smart.  He's social in a way that I almost don't even know how to be.  He looks for and believes in the best in people.  He's genuinely excited about life and treats it like an adventure.  He believes his existence demands something of him, like he's letting not only himself but the world down by not living up to his potential- and that's so far from my own philosophies that it's weird and scary and inspiring to be around.  He actively values friendships in a way that I don't see very often- which can be confusing to me as someone who is very take-them-or-leave-them about the majority of people I've been friends with over the years.  He values *connection*.  

We have an open relationship which requires a lot of emotional work at times and he's always right there willing to put in the effort.  He's willing to really explore himself and grow as I explore myself and grow.  He's not naturally a let's-talk-about-our-feelings guy and I am very much that type of person and he meets me more than halfway.  He knows how and when to say thank you, to express appreciation and gratitude.  He makes me feel valued and he makes me feel loved.

Also he's like super dope in the sack.  Like super dope.

Buy a new honda mc. When do you need it bought in? How often do you get it serviced? How long do the tires and oil last?

When was the last time your bled your cars brakes?

And the capacity of a car vs motorcycle? When was the last time you packed 4 people and their luggage on you bike?

Do we even need to discuss safety?

The only thing bikes have is efficiency. And a lot of them don't get better mileage than a Honda fit. See Harley for more details.

Scooters pollute 40x as much per gallon burnt as a modern car. Bike pollute more per gallon too.

Easy example, what's more efficient? A scooter, a motorcycle, a car, an suv, or a diesel-turbine train? It's the train. But the train is so much bigger and heavier! Efficiency scales upward too.

[Perhaps the most surprising finding is which provinces are at the greatest risk of defaulting on their debt. While Ontario is listed as second-most likely to default — not surprising given the enormous deficits it’s been running in recent years — the most likely province is Alberta.
**Joffe says this is due to several factors, including StatsCan’s projection that Alberta’s population will age faster than in any other part of the country, which raises health care costs; its reliance on volatile commodity prices; and the fact that it is already running a deficit despite relatively high oil prices and a robust, fast-growing economy.
Joffe — a consultant at Public Sector Credit Solutions who is linked to the libertarian-leaning Reason Foundation — calculates the likelihood of an Alberta debt default within 30 years to be around 84 per cent if the province doesn’t alter its finances.** Ontario has a 30-year default likelihood of 79.3 per cent, according to the report.](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/10/18/canada-provinces-euro-style-crisis_n_1980321.html)"

kishbish,TrueAskReddit,1389746564.0,"Let's get the simple stuff over with: Will the United States still exist? Yep. Will the United States have an in-tact, functioning federal government? Yep. 

Here's a few of the differences we'll see in the US in 50 years: 
- There will be nationalized healthcare similar to ones in Canada and Europe. This is due to two big reasons: In order to stay economically competitive globally, employer-paid healthcare will have to fall by the wayside. Secondly, the young generation now (teens through early 30's) will, if historical patterns continue, be the biggest voting demographic, and many of us, if we're not already on-board with universal/nationalized healthcare of some sort, certainly will be when we start having children and health problems of our own, and only the rich can afford it. Guess who we're going to vote for? Politicians who are serious about universal health care. 
- We will be appalled that gay and transgender people were not allowed to marry, not allowed to adopt children, and be fired for their sexual orientation (I think this will happen long before 50 years are up, although there will always be the hold-outs who hang onto their bigotry). 
- Our military and defenses will still be strong, although military forces will be smaller and more technology-based. Despite everything, we're flanked on either side by wide oceans, which is a huge strategic and trading advantage.
- The population in both the US and Europe is in decline, and this will continue for some time. In the US, this has many factors, but one of them is financial. People of child-bearing years are, on average, poorer than their parents' generation was, and child-rearing has become more expensive. When maternity/paternity leave is not legally guaranteed, child care is not subsidized except for the very poor, and inflexible work schedules makes parenthood much harder than it needs to be. This will change, if only because we need those future taxpayers. The government will likely begin to create guarantees (like decent maternity/paternity leave, job protections that are much stronger than they are now, etc) and incentives for couples to have children. 
- University education will be vastly different in the future. Brick and mortar colleges will still exist, however, online education will be the norm. Specialized courses of study, rather than broad degree programs, will be online, available for free or very low cost, and will be focused on specific job skills and academic areas. As a liberal arts major, I hate to say it, but a ""liberal arts degree"" will nearly be extinct in 50 years. Liberal arts studies will be pursued for fun with no thought of preparing for a job (insert snark here). 
- Marijuana will be regulated, but freely available, to all adult citizens.

girlaboutoaktown,AskMen,1389747347.0,"I think there are a lot more guys who are attracted to overweight women than will admit it.  I dated a guy who early on expressed some discomfort with my weight.  I nearly broke up with him on the spot - I mean, we'd only been dating a few months, I hadn't gained any weight in those months, so if he's not going to accept me then, fuck him - but he apologized and begged me to stay.

Years later, he admitted that he actually was more attracted to bigger girls than really skinny girls.  He likes normal girls too, and the bigger girls he found attractive in porn or whatever were generally a bit smaller than me, but he actually likes it, but he felt deeply ashamed of it, because you're just not supposed to like fat girls in western culture anymore.  Everyone acts like this is how it's always been, but 5,000 years of art history tells us otherwise.  

What people find attractive is very malleable and influenced by culture.  And our culture does say ""fat is unattractive"" but for some reason some guys have been and will always be attracted to fat girls.  There are some guys alive today, if they'd been alive in the 1700s, would have liked fat girls because that was the beauty ideal at the time, but don't go for them now.  And there are some guys who would've been the weirdos in the 1700s who would have only liked skinny girls.

I mean, not a whole lot of people today find artificially flattened foreheads attractive, but the Mayans sure as hell did, and if you were raised in Classical Mayan society 600 years ago, you probably would, too.  "

theshedres,portlandstate,1389747458.0,"There are many good arguments on both sides of this issue. Here are a few from my perspective:

This petition fails to consider or acknowledge the student athletes who only make it to college (and thus gain the opportunity to get an education in the first place) *because* of their athletic scholarships. A great deal of college athletes come from lower-income families and have less of (or completely lack) an academic or financial support network. Without sports, many of them would never consider college as an option at all. Athletes that come to PSU generally aren't quite talented enough to get offers from many other schools.

Athletics are also incredibly important to some younger, ""traditional"" students. Portland State doesn't necessarily aim for or tend to attract fresh-out-of-high-school students (as opposed to part-time or older students), but I believe athletics are important to any larger state university. It's a way of creating a recognizable brand that can be used as a marketing tool.

One should consider the [Flutie effect](http://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2013/04/29/the-flutie-effect-how-athletic-success-boosts-college-applications/). A successful football program can have a tremendous impact on both the quality and quantity of applications."

I love casual sex.  I'm not always in the mood for it but I've had plenty of it in my lifetime and I generally regard it as a great thing.  I could care less if other people want to engage in it or not.  When I meet someone who also likes casual sex, I'm like ""yeah dog, casual sex is great, right?"" and when I meet someone who doesn't like it I'm like ""whatever, cool, more for me.""  I don't make any sort of moral judgments based on it because, to me, it seems like a silly thing to base moral judgments on.  

It does frustrate me when people get really up in arms about it, or when they start making blanket statements about it.  Like ""sex should be between two people who love each other.""  It makes me think they're kind of a douchebag just as if someone said ""Pizza should be made with chunky tomato sauce only.""

To be honest he sounds really immature and insecure.

kissacupcake,TwoXChromosomes,1389748876.0,"&gt;  To really be fair both need to be working the same number of hours, whether those hours are inside the house or outside.

I think we just have a very different take on relationships. 

Here's mine: Marriages consist of adults. Each has individual responsibilities, like jobs, and both partners also have joint responsibilities, like housework and rent. Joint responsibilities should be, in my opinion, split evenly, regardless of other factors. If I made $30,000 a year and my husband made $80,000 a year, I would still want to split the rent 50/50. That's just a no brainer - for me. But I'm a very individualistic, independent person, and I would never want to combine my finances with those of my spouse. 

&gt; Wow, I really think you need to check your Female Privilege. You really have the gall to state that his working so hard is not a sacrifice for their marriage or for her? Men are required by society to financially support their family, period.

Expected by society to financially support his family, yes. Required by his wife to financially support her, no. I admit that I may need to think more about this, but I really don't think I need to CMP here - I would never expect to be financially supported by a spouse, under any circumstances. "

bananaruth,TwoXChromosomes,1389749028.0,"I'm also a clinically depressed introvert. I completely understand your statement about talking to therapists/etc. not really working in the past. I had to talk to several people until I found someone who really seemed to understand me. A lot of times their solution seems to be ""just go out and do things, go to parties, etc."". The problem of course is that a 'happy' me would not enjoy large parties very much. I think the biggest thing I've learned over the years is that it's okay to want to spend time alone. That doesn't mean there's something wrong with me. 

The other thing I've realized is that, as you've discovered, getting a job, losing weight, buying a house, etc. will not fix your problems. You can't expect them to. If the reason you're unhappy is that you don't have a job, it might fix the problem, but that isn't really the reason you are unhappy is it? There may in fact not even be a real reason. The best advice I can give is to not aim for being happy. Do things because you want to do them and you might get some happiness or at least some satisfaction out of that. You don't do things to be happy, you're happy because you're doing things. That's my experience anyways. 

Dogs really are great. Are you taking yours for regular walks? I know it's cliche, but exercise really does help alleviate depression. 

Long distance communication can be difficult. Some people are worse at it than others. You are important and I'm sure many people care about you, but since they see you less than previously, they get busy and it's difficult for them to remember or find time to call you. Have you called them?Try not to worry about it. If they care, they will get back to you eventually. In the meantime, focus on where you are right now. Have you made any friends yet? "

He asks him to meet him because he needs a favour. When Benedict learns about what the favour is about, he initially thinks he just has to baby sit for his friend while the friend goes off to fix a deal gone bad. Then we see them being kidnapped and we think they are being held captive to provide leverage for the bad guys when in fact it was all set up by the friend and his (military trained daughter?) to catch the bad guys. So in fact the favour wasn't to take care of the daughter and more like act as bait for him and/or the daughter to kill them. 

Personally, I would love if they made a full feature movie about it. It seems like the story has a lot of potential.

Gl33m,childfree,1389750043.0,"Overall, I was a good kid. I just wanted to be left alone to watch TV or play video games. The only issues my parents had was when trying to force me to do something I didn't want to without any sort of reasoning for it. I was the kid that responded to being told ""clean your room"" with ""it's my room. It's not dirty, just cluttered. Things are where I like them, and I know where everything is. No one goes in my room but me. My room is at the end of the hall, and I keep my door shut anyway. So it isn't like anyone will see in my room. Why should I clean it?""

Of course, once I moved in with my dad and step-mom, things made even less sense to me. I'd get told to clean my room, give up arguing, clean it, and get told to clean it again a week or two later. I wouldn't actually move anything in my room during that time. Everything was in the same location for weeks. It left me so confused. Finally, I had one of my parents come in my room and tell me exactly what they wanted me to do to clean it. Aside from ""make your bed"" (to which I responded I was -in- my bed before they made me get up to ""clean"") they didn't even have any idea what they wanted me to do.

And that's when I realized my parents never had any idea what they were doing. They just told me to do stuff they thought they were suppose to make me do. My mom told me a few years back my step-dad used to sit up at night bothered by me arguing with him after he told me to do something. He told my mom that the worst part is I was right, but he felt he couldn't just ""let me win."""

This isn't to say that there aren't plenty of guys in their 40s who want sex every day, just that there is for some a noticeable decrease.  If he wasn't that HL to begin with, coupled with depression, diabetes, etc....it's a really difficult situation to fix.

You can't make him want it.  That's impossible.  Are there any things that he can do that don't involve him wanting it that can help satisfy you?  Cuddling, make out sessions, him helping you get off?

The part of the VIN that Chictyler is talking about is the sequence number and it's only 5 digits.  I don't think anyone would complain if they started from 99999 and counted backward, or used some more bizarre scheme.

I *think* they can also reuse those same 100k serial numbers if the model number is different.  So they could sell 100k 60kw Model S's and 100k 85kw Model S's with the same serial numbers.

theHBIC,loseit,1389750425.0,"Hi team. I'm a 24 year old lady; 5'2"", 190 pounds. I'm horrified by how big I've gotten in the last two years, to be honest. After college, I spent some time abroad, and when I returned I got really depressed, and that's where my issues started. I finally have gotten myself mentally where I want to be, and now I'm ready to get myself physically back to looking and feeling good. 

I do have a background that, I feel, contributes to my /r/fit journey. From ages 14-19, I had a pretty serious eating disorder. I alternated between being exercise bulimic and anorexic. 

It took me a long time to get myself back on track- even after returning to what would be considered ""normal"" eating habits, I had a very unhealthy relationship with food until about a year ago. During this time, I started to gain a lot of weight, but the idea of limiting my calories and exercising regularly intimidated me. My eating disorder was a huge comfort to me, and I want to work hard to develop a normal, emotionally healthy relationship with food. 

That's my secondary goal; I want to learn to enjoy healthy food, want to learn not to reward myself with food, and want to learn to love exercising. 

My hope is to get back down to 130 pounds, but my primary weight loss goal is to get down to 150 pounds, back within a healthy BMI. I'm looking forward to being a part of a community, having people to encourage me and share my progress with!"

keypuncher,conservatives,1389750460.0,"&gt; Are you saying that reporting multiple ""long gun"" sales is the same restricting our right to bear arms? Or, am I missing how that was push to restrict the 2nd amendment? 

Here is a bit more on [Demand Letter 3.](http://www.arizonadailyindependent.com/2013/06/19/salmon-bill-would-stop-demand-letter-3-doj-scheme/)

We now know what we only suspected at the time - that the Federal Government was illegally spying on US citizens and retaining huge, databases of illegally obtained information on everyone.  While it hasn't been specifically addressed in Snowden's leaks, the chance that the Federal Government has not been illegally retaining firearms background check information is vanishingly small.  Demand Letter 3 would be a means of adding long guns to that illegal Federal database.

As world history shows, and as gun owners in New York and California have recently discovered in the US, mandatory firearm registration is inevitably used for confiscations of those firearms at a later date.

So yes - reporting is restricting our right to keep and bear arms."

pamplemus,changemyview,1389750627.0,"i'm going to answer under the assumption that you meant to discuss psychotherapy instead of psychiatry. 

how long have your siblings been in therapy? i ask because, generally speaking, there are different stages of counseling. the first is exploration in which the client and the therapist collect information pertinent to the psychological issues present and then discuss the client's thoughts and feelings. the second stage is insight in which they analyze what they talked about in the first stage and the therapist helps the client to understand what's going on. the third stage is action, which is pretty self-explanatory: the therapist works with the client to make changes in his or her life.

this is a process that can take a long time - up to several years for some people. i mean, you don't show up for your first therapy appointment, and the counselor hands you a list of 50 ways they think you should change. that's not going to go over well. you need to fully understand a problem to solve it. if your toilet breaks, you don't just start doing random things and hope they'll work. no, you figure out what's broken, make emergency fixes if necessary, and then you look into why and how it broke in order to fix it properly and prevent it from happening again. what i'm trying to say is, just because your siblings aren't making any changes that are visible to you doesn't mean they're lazy. perhaps they might not be ready for that yet. i think there's also the very possible possibility that they're simply not involving you in this part of their life (probably because you look down on it so heavily!).

i will say that personal accountability is (or at least should be) emphasized from the very beginning of therapy. ideally, the therapist explicitly tells the patient at their first meeting that change takes work. a LOT of clients come to therapy, sit down, and expect the therapist to regurgitate certain phrases that will magically improve their life. except that's (obviously) not how it happens. the client has to put in consistent effort; they might even get homework between sessions! for this reason, i think it's ludicrous to claim that psychology doesn't emphasize personal improvement because that's basically the whole fucking point!"

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389750905.0,"Ugh, I used to have this problem all the time with my husband.  It lead to plenty of frustration and resentment.  And it was often silly because talking later we'd discover we were both horny at the same time, but either one of us wouldn't make the move, or one of us would THINK we were making a move but the other partner wouldn't realize it.

I think communication here is really important.  We learned this through fighting about it, actually.  I'd say, ""I always have to initiate!  You never do and that makes me you feel like you don't want it, so then I don't want to initiate more!"" and he'd say, ""What are you crazy?  I totally initiated the other day but you weren't interested!"" and I'd be like ""What? WHEN?!""  Total breakdown of communication.  

I didn't realize for him, that acting cuddly, giving me little back rubs, kissing my neck, playfully grabbing by ass were initiating.  I just thought he was being cuddly/considerate/sweet/playful.  He didn't realize that because for me to get into it via those non verbal cues, I need it to be more direct.  If he grabs me and kisses me passionately while caressing me and whispers naughty stuff in my ear - THAT'S initiating - to me.  

So I've tried to be better about picking up on initiation from him with the way he does it, and he's gotten better about being more obvious because that's what I need.  

As for me, I'm really direct, so if I initiate it's usually with serious kissing, grabbing his dick, often in conjunction with saying, ""Hey, let's fuck.""  I'm more of a direct communicator than him, I guess.  

But I also don't want to be the one always initiating, or even most of the time.  (I'm OK with doing it 30-50% of the time, but I can often sort of ignore/forget about sex until I feel passionately wanted and desired, so I need that from him a good chunk of the time to get in the mood.)

Now we're on day 15 of a 30 day sex challenge (and we're on track!  We did use up our one ""no sex"" day the other night but given that we'd just flown back from an exhausting weekend trip I think that's fair) and one of the reasons I love it is that it's taken the initiation pressure/issue off the table entirely.  We know we HAVE to have sex of some kind every day, so we're both being very direct about it.  

We're half and half scheduling our sex - like today, I had a few hours of work and he had to go to work at night, but he wanted to get a run in, so we agreed a few hours ahead of time that we'd have sex after he ran and had a shower, before he went to work.  

But other times it's just coming more naturally, I think because we know we're doing the challenge we find ourselves just being way more sexually available/open with each other.  A little bit of kisses quickly turns into a makeout session turns into sex, because if we have to have it every day, any little thing is a good excuse to check that off the list. 

That doesn't sound sexy, but it actually is.  At least for us.

I hope when the challenge is over we can take what we've learned about initiating into our ""normal"" sex lives - a good mix of scheduling and just letting things develop from natural flirting/cuddling/whatever - seems ideal.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389751155.0,"What, am I not supposed to?

I got curious because of your post and had to go look for where it says this, all I can find is ""rare or undercooked meat"" which doesn't seem to differentiate between beef, pork, or poultry nor between whole cut or ground/minced meats.  WTF is with that?  They haven't taken enough away with scare tactics so they've got to mislead us about steak now too?

But the NHS site had a few extra details at least:

&gt;[The Department of Health previously advised that it was fine to eat whole cuts of beef and lamb rare, as long as the outside had been properly cooked. As a precaution, this advice has now been removed while a food safety committee (The Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food) looks into the issue of toxoplasmosis.
Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a parasite that can be found in meat, soil, cat faeces and untreated water. If you are pregnant the infection can damage your baby, but it's important to remember that toxoplasmosis in pregnancy is very rare.](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/foods-to-avoid-pregnant.aspx#Raw)

So I had to start looking further into it, I'm thinking dammit, this could be legit.  But wait, other risk factors include eating [unwashed fruits and vegetables, and... contact with soil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii#Risk_factors_for_human_infection)?  Starting to doubt again, sounds like the whole world is trying to kill my baby scare tactics.

To prevent transmission the CDC recommends:

&gt;[Cook to at least 145° F (63° C) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming.](http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/faqs.html)

which according to another random article on the internet means steak should be about [medium](http://bbq.about.com/od/steaks/ss/aa101606a_4.htm).

So I'm a bit annoyed that I can't actually find stats on transmission risk, but I guess I'll consider ordering my steak medium rather than medium rare.  I still don't think it's nearly as bad as all the pregnancy articles made it out to be though.

***SERIOUSLY UNPLEASANT FACT WARNING***:

Doc Johnson makes a wireless egg that's good and has 5+ functions, and is really quiet. It'll retail for somewhere between $30-$50, I'm guessing. If you have bigger bucks to spend and want something REALLY, REALLY COOL, check out the We-Vibe. The latest models are remote-controlled, fully submersible in water, absolutely discreet (they ""clip on"" to the vulva hands-free, are really ergonomic and won't make a bulge in the panties), very very quiet and rechargeable. 

I also recommend going into your local sex shop and asking about it.

I also wish that in general, colleges would scale down their administrations and building projects. Of course they need to stay competitive but there's no reason for a small college to have a $30 million dollar arts building while all the professors are adjuncts. 

While I agree with you that learning to be part of a group, collaborating and learning to compromise effectively are important, I see a lot of these skills becoming less used over time, which will be unfortunate. As more of our lives are spent online, younger people especially will spend less time with face-to-face interactions and once they are out of school (where most of their group work happens, either classroom work or sports), there will be less reason to hone those skills unless specifically demanded by their chosen career. Even though I'm only 30, I already see a marked difference between how I handled social and community life and how these things are handled by younger people. It isn't necessary better or worse (I'm not really the type to decry younger generations - each generation is its own animal, with its own good and bad aspects) but I do think we'll see social anxiety disorders skyrocket over the next 50 years.

I find that the most important thing is to be open and honest about how you're feeling.  I'm not rational right now, don't expect me to be.  I have absolutely no sex drive.  None of this is my husband's fault, I still love him, I still think he's the sexiest manbeast on the planet, and I am very much looking forward to getting back on the horse after the baby arrives.  It does come back.  It takes some time and some effort but it comes back.

I suggest having that talk with him, keep it calm and neutral.  Explain that pregnancy has psychological as well as physiological symptoms and this is one of them.  Reassure him that it is only that, and that it is normal and it is something you can work through as a couple once your hormones get back to normal.  Then ask him to help support you in dealing with these symptoms.

Being a supportive partner means more than telling you to breath and getting their fingers crushed during labour.  It means helping cope with insane midnight food cravings and irrational moodiness, and feeling fat and gross and unsexy.  It's part of the deal with pregnancy.

If you have that conversation calmly and discuss how to approach this as a couple it should help.  It also doesn't hurt to encourage him to take care of himself, remember to compliment him and try to be affectionate in non-sexual ways to reassure him.  Do your best to be romantic  but talk first so you're on the same page and you know it is ok if it doesn't work for you.  It will all work out."

Every single person I asked said a 760 is already overkill for the stuff I am doing, I literally don't play graphically intensive games what-so-ever, so I'm definitely going to stick with my chosen one as it fits nicely with me scheme.

As for the CPU and RAM, it seems to be split but I guess the majority of people say I should go for 16GB of RAM for what I am doing, but it seems to be a split decision for i5/i7. However, if it's the only thing I am potentially changing, I don't mind spending the extra to make it last longer.

* Install DHCP server onto the ""server"" VM, and configure to give out IPs (you'll need this to PXE boot)
* Install pre-reqs and MDT onto the ""server"" VM
* Install WDS to that server as well, for PXE boot
* Update the deployment share to create boot images, and import the 32bit image into the WDS server as a boot image
* Add Windows 7 SP1 (or Windows 8, etc) to the Operating Systems node
* Add the hotfix packages for Windows that you've downloaded into the packages node
* Add the Office application into the Applications node and extract any updates into the \Updates folder
* Add any other applications you want to install in the base image as well
* Create an ""Application bundle"" in the Applications node, and add each package you want to be deployed as dependencies
* Make sure you have installed WSUS on the server VM, keeping it synchronized with Windows and Office updates for the version(s) you will be putting into your image
* Create a task sequence in MDT to deploy the OS you want to refresh regularly
* Edit that task sequence to enable the pre and post-application Windows Update passes
* Also change the default ""Install Applications"" task to install a single application, and choose the Application bundle you created previously
* Add the WSUSServer variable to your customsettings.ini, pointing at your WSUS server

You can now PXE boot a new virtual machine on that host if created with the legacy network adapter, and it will boot into MDT.  Select your task sequence and you should be good to go.

I have a big, delicious sweet potato in my oven as I type this out I'm going to be eating with some chicken in a tomato sauce and a salad later that's bursting with carbs. It also, as it just so happens, is full of wonderful nutrients like vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B6, C, and D, along with iron, magnesium, copper, potassium, biotin, beta carotene, and fiber. That it's about 93% carbohydrates is immaterial, because it's a wonderful, natural source of what my body needs to function efficiently and effectively. 

That said, your heart will be fine on a proper low-carb diet, so long as you've done your homework and you're eating a wide variety of foods that run the nutrient gambit. If I removed the sweet potato from my dinner tonight (hypothetically; in reality I would never miss an opportunity to eat a sweet potato because they're awesome), I'd be having a low-carb meal of boneless baked chicken thighs, skin-off, in a light tomato sauce, along with a fresh garden salad consisting primarily of butter lettuce, mushrooms, and green peppers. Does any of that sound like it's going to clog my arteries? 

The nice thing about Paleo, imho, is that it's actually quite simple: eat real food, meaning primarily plants and meats. Our bodies are amazing digestive machines when it comes to some foods, many of which we've been eating for a long time and are adapted to eating. A small handful of wild blueberries or some poultry are going to give your body a lot more bang for their buck than a tube of Pringles or a bowl of sugary cereal in milk. While I suppose it's possible to eat unhealthy on Paleo (like eating nothing but canned tuna), for the most part it's basically bulletproof as a concept to eat good, healthy foods. I'm aware of no significant negative side effects from a balanced Paleo diet, other than it sometimes being a bit more expensive and the transition period going onto Paleo being a little uncomfortable for some.

FewRevelations,bisexual,1389753516.0,"Tell him not to ever be ashamed of having the gay side and the straight side have different balances. Some days I'm 75% lesbian, 25% straight. Some days I'm 32% lesbian, 67% straight. It can feel really confusing but let him know that his identity isn't dependent on his level of gay or straightness, and don't worry about sorting that out too strongly. He just needs to let himself fall for whomever he falls for. Also, if he's ever with a person of one gender and he starts craving sex with the other gender, that's normal and common and you need to talk to your partner about it instead of just cutting off the relationship because you think you aren't attracted to their gender any more.
