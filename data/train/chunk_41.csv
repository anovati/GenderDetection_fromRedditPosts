BelleLune,beyondthebump,1390754053.0,"Step 1: I start by nursing her in a quiet, dim lit room. She'll nurse for 15-20 minutes until she starts closing her eyes and drifting to sleep. Then she violently removes herself from the boob, practically ripping my nipple off, and cries. 
Step 2: Then I wrestle her back onto the boob and she'll nurse again until she seems like she might be asleep. 
Step 3: Then I'll lay her in her crib ever so gently and back away slowly through the door (sometimes this is the moment where my 5 year old decides to yell or come barging through the door which usually puts us back to step 1)
Step 4: Then she wakes back up and I let her cry it out for a few moments while I mourn my sanity in the other room.
Step 5: After what feels like a lifetime of her crying and screaming in the  bedroom, I pick her up and try to calm her down. At this point, she usually just starts crying louder and louder while trying to latch on to any part of me she can find.
Step 6: We're back to nursing in the quiet, dim lit room. Sometimes I cry a little bit.

vorpalblab,AskMen,1390754204.0,"From the geriatric end of older (70 ish) how do I respect teens and young women?

I am not every old phogy, so just my point of view here.

I currently have an art studio I share with mostly twenty something art students whose friends run the gamut from late teens to thirty.

I don't work very hard now, and spend time with the younger peeps chatting about what they are doing and they sometimes ask how to do something with whatever they are gonna try next.

About the ones I respect?

So we discuss, and I talk about how I solved or did not solve some issue and encourage them to let me know if what they decide to do worked out, then we strategise over how to fix it or not. On an equal to equal basis using first names.

I respect the young women if they are courteous to their peers and to me and are straightforward in their relationships and speech.

I also know from my own life that they will have lots of gaps in knowledge, the young wll also know stuff I never will know or experience.

I dislike when they start blowing smoke about how much they know, are able to - whatever. But time will teach, and it ain't my job. But I do not respect boastfulness, rash decisions where the consequences of failure are severe.

Ink, metal, polychrome hair, whatever the current style? Be what ya wanna be. Your time is now and enjoy it.

But if its gonna be ink?

Pretty phuleeze do not put some cookie cutter Disney shit on your arm or ankle. And no hooker stamps on the  base of your spine. Get a bit of decent art that will last and still look cool wen your 40 and a mom of three.

Keep the metal outta your nose. It creeps me out. Most metal is superfluous decoration of something pretty awesome in its own right.

I was one of those long haired drug crazed hippie Stones fans for god's sake. (And the Stones, Dylan and Beatles are my age) but I only wore it longish and only did the less dangerous stuff ( avoided speed, coke and heroin). And it was not several times a day, more like social.

Find out how much beer makes you puke, and drink less when you do drink. 

Do not confuse drunk with having fun, sex for love, risky for fun . The fun part of the end of risk is the realization that you survived.. Heavy risk taking means you will lose eventually.

High risk, low self preservation stuff loses my respect.

Dress as sexy as you please, and I will appreciate the look, will peek at what is in the showroom window, but I won't hit on you. I might even tell you if its especially good.

It makes my day to see young people inventing the world they will live in. 

Mine turned out pretty good compared to where it was headed when we started revolting, marching, and peacenicking all over the place."

They're so boring I want the whole DC universe rebooted so they can go back to being fun to read about.

I also feel like Scott Lobdell doesn't get how teenagers work. The series is weirdly serious, and teenagers are *never, ever* that serious, and when he tries to have comedy it's just boring. It also had this weird sense of mystery in the early issues at least (before I dropped it) that didn't want me to read more, it just made me want to punch each and every character in the face and tell them to fucking talk to each other.

I fell into the field almost on a whim. I originally attended school for Engineering and Geophysics, never expecting that I would ever work with kids. Then life happened and I dropped out. My mother worked at a childcare center and I was using that as a base of operations while looking for jobs in the area. I got to know the staff and directors, and one day one of the teachers asked me to come read some books to her class. The kids were enraptured by my storytelling and suddenly I was a hot commodity at the school. Since I needed a job anyways, I spoke with the directors and the owner of the school about employment, and the rest is history. 

I still remember my first day on the job, I walked into the classroom and had no idea what I was doing. This little girl runs up to me, throws her arms around my legs, looks up into my eyes and says, ""Who are you?"" It was then that I knew I had some educating to do.

As for doing this until retirement, as much as I would love to, there just isn't enough money to make a living in it. I'd like to go back to school and finish my degree in science, and see if I could find a teaching spot at a High School or what have you from there. One thing is for sure, whatever I do, I want to be able to educate others. It's what I feel I was born to do."

k3rnelpanic,rccars,1390754542.0,"For a first rc car you might want to consider something that has a starting system like the Traxxas.

Pull start is nice because you don't need a battery but you still need to remember to charge your glow plug ignitor. I've found the most trouble free starting system is a bump box. No one way bearing and the glow starter is quite often built into the box. 

The biggest upside to nitro is you just keep adding fuel. Want to play all day? Just bring enough fuel. It's also pretty neat that there is a real running motor in your rc. 

Downside? Tuning can be troublesome until you get used to it. Worse is the mess. Your rig gets coated in a layer of oil and dirt.

On good nights, I love the cuddles and having her close to me. I love not having to get up out of bed for night feedings. Overall, I'm sure I get better sleep this way.


But there are bad nights, where I feel like I'm stuck in one position all night long because she just nurses non-stop. I wake up stiff and uncomfortable, with terrible back pain. I hate not being able to snuggle up with my husband.

Circumcision isn't that bad; it makes the penis look nicer, easier to clean, less susceptible to certain conditions. etc.  
Some say it reduces sexual pleasure, and I did a lot of research into this and made several threads asking people who were circumcised as adults about the pleasure before and after the procedure, and most say the the penis is just a little disentesied, but it's nothing major; honestly, if sex was any better my head would explode!  
And the reason they do it at such an young age is because it is extremely painful, and those who went through adult circumcision due to medical conditions will tell you that they would have rather had it done when they were very young, and not yet able to form memories.  
The second problem is with botched jobs that lead to mutilation or even death, yes these happen, yes these are way too common, but it doesn't mean the problem lies with circumcision, but it lies with the unsafe practices and bad doctors.

Go into any fanbase of anything ever and they will tell you that things that are not their favorite things do not represent the genre of their favorite things and aren't ""real things"". This applies to music, games, art, religion, the way your toilet paper faces, fucking *everything that one can have an opinion on*. Elitism is hardly exclusive to classic rock.

As for the oppression system violence blah blah whatever, she basically just called it racist because race is tangentially related. I can do that too. Fire hydrants are racist, because fire hoses have been used against black people in the past. Hell, I'm more convinced that fire hydrants are a symbol of oppression than classic rock is and that's just some bullshit I made up. At least ""black people getting attacked with high-pressure water for speaking out against racism"" is a weighty statement, unlike ""some black people I can't actually name didn't get popular because whitey's keeping them down""."

Why or how would people still be gunslinging, armor-wearing, or English-speaking, 100-200 years after the basis of those things is destroyed? Guns and bullets break or run out, you have to resort to primitive weaponry such as spears, bows, arrows, and sticks.

You can't have robots or manufacturing still running, you have no resources or education! The best thing you can make is a bison-skin tent and a leather flap over your crotch.

And English? Well, look back 100 years from right now. The word ""gay"" comes to mind, as does ""telephone"" or ""auto"". Then look back 200 years at the English language.

The list of actors who started or became note-worthy from The Wire is incredible.

Personally, I don't see any cons for this new TV movement. Movies will get better to try and compete with the TV shows, the TV will keep getting better. As the actors move over, so will the directors. Spielberg's and Tom Hanks 2001 Band of Brothers comes to mind when I think of what a prominent and brilliant film director can do in tandem with an almost exclusively film actor in Hanks.

*One* drawback I could see happening is this: Take Bryan Cranston, the likely-hood of him doing something as good as BrBa is almost zero. Few will see him as anything other than WW. Generally the character in a movie won't be as developed as and character in a TV show. Limiting an actor to one major TV series each. Now I hope I'm wrong but the likes of James Gandolfini couldn't have played the lead in another TV show, without being exclusively compared to his work in The Sopranos."

POGtastic,TumblrInAction,1390755832.0,"This. People who revere classic rock forget that there was just as much garbage on the radio back then. Sure, you had The Who and Led Zeppelin, but you also had disco, psychedelic rock that was explicitly only good for getting high to, really bad hair metal, and plenty of crappy pop songs. They had *Wham* for crying out loud!

The only reason why we have classic rock today is that all of the garbage and mediocrity has been removed. Not only that, a lot of these classic bands have albums that tanked. They aren't played anymore; what's left is their really good music, and that's what they're revered for.

My guess is that ""2010s music"" will become a genre just like any other - channel 11 on Sirius XM. There will be one or two songs by Katy Perry, one or two songs by Rhianna, one or two songs by Lady Gaga, etc. Call Me Maybe, on the other hand, will not be there.

Cart before the horse. The classics are classics because certain groups of people decided they were. There's no objective measure of worth for books.

&gt; No Aristotle? Socrates via Plato, Aristotle, and all the way up to Kant, are the figureheads for all of modern philosophy.

However, within philosophy, Aristotle is a historical figure, but his actual philosophy is virtually ignored. And there are more readable and more clear Platonists than Plato.

&gt;  that came out of a time when women weren't encouraged

And now they are and the female sex has produced a number of excellent writers. The Bronte sister wrote very boring and urbane books compared to what women have accomplished since then. Historical curio, again, not something that's extremely meaningful to students. If they only get to read one or two female authors, should we be telling our young women they shouldn't write anything more creative than Jane Eyre?

&gt;critical analysis.

I don't think this is remotely valuable in most highschool classes, which are more concerned with getting kids to engage at all, and make their *own* arguments.

&gt; I'll have to ask you then, if these authors aren't who you would put in a curriculum, who would you choose?

It would take me extensive time to answer this question - I've read a lot of books with a lot of different content, and I don't know enough about teaching to make a determination about what students could identify with. I would love to see Kerouac, Herbert, Asimov, Richard Wright, Pahlaniuk, Borges, Lessing, Allende, Hosseini, Gaiman, Pratchet - and I'd love to see the 'classic' authors' better works instead of more famous ones, like Breakfast of Champions, Sun Also Rises, Martian Chronicles, Twelfth Night..."

allycakes13,AskWomen,1390756181.0,"I didn't want to be selfish anymore. I wanted to sacrifice everything for him. In the past all my relationships were about what I wanted as how they made me happy. He looks me in the eyes and calls my bull shit. He sees the way I was broken and he looked at the root of the problem and wanted to help. I would sleep on the floor if the bed weren't big enough, I'd save the last Oreo for him and move heaven and hell to make sure he is taken care of. I still get selfish from time to time, but I'm working on it. 

And before anyone gets all 'women's rights', or whatever, we were both spoiled and over privileged. We have both been really selfish our entire lives. He feels the same way about me.

ballookey,exjw,1390756219.0,"Why judge them individually at all? Why judge the organization? You've not been asked to sit on a jury. No one is awaiting your decision.

*For now*, you need to get perspective. Later, you may, as a result of your perspective, formulate a judgement about individuals and the organization naturally ‚Äî as an organic consequence of your experience and perspective. But this isn't an urgent matter. You don't have to stop everything and come up with an answer on how you ""judge"" them this moment.

Decide to be in an ""Information Gathering"" mode. This means getting therapy, working on yourself, reading and acquiring knowledge on topics that interest you, gathering experiences, building a life. Now and then, poke your feelings about the JW's individually and as an organization and see what you think.

But you don't, like, have to turn in a paper with your written judgement on the matter. It's OK to be fluid and questioning, and uncertain.

ETA: in fact, being uncertain is something that JW's have little experience with. They don't have much of a grey area. This is something that's part of leaving them behind: learning that there are grey areas. That there is no fundamental epic battle between Good and Evil and that every action and thought can't be sorted into those two bins. It WILL be uncomfortable if you've been raised with that certainty, with those rigid controls. Being uncomfortable means you're changing‚Ä¶and that might be good."

Willravel,SanJose,1390756911.0,"Back in the Mesozoic era when I was your age, I found that retail work was often highly competitive in hiring, paid very little, and was extremely unfulfilling. Everyone in my senior class was looking for retail work, as were the seniors from most of the other area high schools. When I applied to places like American Eagle or Circuit City (R.I.P.), my resume looked like every other resume from kids trying to get their first job. Retail is not the only work available for 17 year olds. 

After I worked at Radio Shack and Sears, I found a landscaping company that was looking for people with a good work ethic and a valid drivers license. I made a decent enough wage, got to work outside, actually built things that are still up and looking great, got a ton of on-the-job experience and education, and I lost about 15. lbs in two months, even though I was only a little overweight when I started. It was a great job. Yes, you have to get up before the sun, you're sore at the end of the day, and if you have allergies you need to be on a steady diet of antihistamines, but it was a lot better than folding shirts or selling cell phones. The skills I developed landscaping are why I have a really lovely garden in my back yard right now, and I'm still friends with a lot of the guys I worked with.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390757440.0,"&gt; planet energy

To quote their own website:

&gt;Planet Energy purchases the natural gas and electricity on your behalf and we supply it through the existing structure your utility company uses.

In other words they're a private company reselling/repackaging the same power and natural gas that is under crown monopoly, on the same crown monopoly owned distribution grid, and point of sale delivered by the same local utilities.  So where are they adding any value to the process you ask?  Well they aren't.  Basically they're a price insurance system, you decide what sort of price risk exposure you want, and they take a fee to offer it to you.  

That's not illegal and it's not a scam, particularly if you're a commercial buyer or have power  requirements that are heavy during peak times those  sorts of deals can be desirable, but it's not a serious investment in the electrical power industry in canada. 

The only big 'private' power companies in Ontario are the guys who operate the Bruce nuclear station, and a group called brookfield renewable energy, who are, well, a renewable energy supplier.  But they all still distribute through  Hydro One to your local utility.  

N.B. I am deliberately avoiding the term 'hydro' for power, even though it's quite a common canadianism,  as that A: means water, and B: most power in Ontario is not from hydroelectric sources anymore.   "

rowd149,programming,1390757830.0,"I've thought for a long time how to make this issue clear for people who have a hard time understanding it, and I think I've come up with an analogy that makes sense. You can imagine someone's confidence, their self-esteem, their willingness to take on difficult tasks, as a big tub of water. When the tub is empty, the person quits; they just have nothing left to keep going. Well, obviously outright discrimination takes big bucketfuls out of that tub. And we've worked hard to make sure that people carrying buckets don't get close to people's tubs. But what is as damaging, as insidiuous, as scooping out a gallon or two in one fell swoop, is something imperceptibly slow, nearly invisible, but a force that is acting all the time anyway: evaporation.

 What we are trying to get people to understand is that the little jokes, the ""harmless"" comments, even the fact that you are often the only woman or black man or gay man in the room: it's like putting the tub out in the sun. No single act will empty the tub, but every act *contributes*, even the ones that are only barely, tangentially related. There's no way to change the laws of physics, but you can build shelter over the tub; you can stop by on occassion and drop a cup or two back into it. In other words, you can't prevent every little action that might make someone feel unwelcome. However, you can build structure to mitigate their effects; you can counteract the effects of these environments by going out of your way to make people who would otherwise feel unwelcome, feel welcome.

So, no, we're not dealing with triviality here. We're dealing with compounding events. And I should note that whenever these things come up, there is always someone who says that the event in question isn't legitimately injurious enough to consider, even if they do recognize the compounding effects of smaller events. My question is: where do we start to change, if not here?

&gt; If something is so obviously wrong as the S button not working half the time I would just try reinstalling the game.

There was no installation, the game (on windows at least) comes with an executable file when you unzip the download, otherwise I would have tried.

&gt; Just to make sure, you are pressing ""S"" and not 's'?

I saved/reloaded and switched between tile and ASCII roughly 30-40 times. I also made sure I hadn't capslock on etc etc etc. The key would only *very* occasionally work, usually not. When this, or another, problem came up *no* other keys would work until I repeatedly hit space - this included things like the inventory screen. Oh, I also tried different key settings per the options menu without success.

I got a similar menu than the one you linked, although the visual style was different in both tile and ASCII (different console I guess?). I'll provide a screen from my next game soon, but one thing I know for sure: it didn't say 'you may make...', and I had no letters next to the skill unless I selected 'help' with TAB. There were also no ( ), not with a 1 in it or otherwise. As I said, screen will follow.

&gt; Did you try using 'p' to interact with the doctor?

I did not, as the ingame help does not list this key, checked a bunch of times. I got a prompt for it on entering the place on my final reload, but never before, and I had entered and left the shop at least five times or more.

prettyorganic,AskReddit,1390757913.0,"So I'm a 21 year old woman, and though I predict some of the responses here will end up pissing me off, I appreciate you asking this question because it actually really makes me think.

I don't think I tend to use the word a LOT myself casually, but I think it's become a bit interchangeable with ""annoying"" in that way. It's a vague descriptor for unwanted interactions (often, but not always, flirtatious interactions). It doesn't mean ""I'm better than you"" it just means ""I don't want to be interacted with in this way in this context"". For example, if I go in to a TA's office hours for help and he hits on me, that might be creepy, he's in a position of power in an environment that should be professional. However, in a parallel universe where he isn't my TA, he might hit on me at a coffee shop or a bar or whatever and I would be fine with that.

I think ""casual creepy"" ( as opposed to ""stalker creepy"" or whatever) has a lot to do with timing and context.

Again, I appreciate you asking this, I'm going to try a little harder to be conscientious about my use of the word."

WormTickle,USMilitarySO,1390757988.0,"Well, we're also a little older than most military couples who are at the same time of their careers. We were together a good 5ish years before he enlisted. My husband joined at 27, and he's 31 now. So for us to wait until he was out would have meant significantly delaying starting our family in a way we didn't want to do.

I also constantly compare myself to Penelope and Odysseus. They spent ten years apart and Penelope was loyal to her husband, even with zero news of if he was even alive. So when they go river city for a few days, I just think, ""Penelope had it worse."" When he's gone for 3/6/7/9 months at a time, I always think that it could be worse.

So my mantra is, ""No news is good news, and until I've heard no news of him and his fate for *10 years*, I'm doing fine."""

Willravel,fitmeals,1390758256.0,"Certainly. /r/fitmeals has a ton of folks who drink smoothies of all different types for different fitness goals. I've been using Alton Brown's recipe from Good Eats for years now, and it's a wonderful way to have a quick meal if you don't have a lot of time in the morning. 

I have several big bags of frozen fruit in my freezer. The night before I want a smoothie breakfast, I'll get 1/4 cup each of frozen strawberries, blueberries, and either mango or peach, and put them in a tupperware container with 1/4 cop of pomegranate juice and almond milk. The container goes in the refrigerator overnight so, in the morning, I just pour the contents into my blender and have a healthy and delicious breakfast ready in under a minute. I usually also include protein powder, as I exercise in the morning before I eat breakfast. This is my most common summer breakfast, as it's refreshingly cool in the morning. 

The recipe is highly adaptable to your nutritional needs and individual taste. I often substitute raspberries for the blueberries, as I don't mind the seeds. Mango and peach are great, but nectarines and apricots work well, too, along with papaya. I prefer almond milk, but soy milk, rice milk, and dairy milk (cow, goat, camel, dolphin?) are also perfectly fine. And there are plenty of things you can add. I use protein powder, you can also add flaxseed, chia, maca, coconut, tea, ginger, greens like spinach and kale, really anything you might want or like. "

POGtastic,TumblrInAction,1390758437.0,"There's a big difference between Elvis blatantly ripping off entire songs from black artists and Black Sabbath using a blues chord progression.

The former, the white guy is quite literally stealing - he's taking a song that someone else put their passion into, playing it himself, and then saying, ""Well, I'm Elvis. What are you going to do about it?""

The latter, the band is taking a chord progression and maybe a drum rhythm. Everything else is his own creation - the aesthetic of the music, the lyrics, the tone - it's all his. If we're going to condemn that sort of ""influence"" the same way that we condemn Elvis ripping off black artists, then pretty much everyone is stealing from someone.

What's your opinion on sampling? Rap artists sample a lot of older songs, and they frequently don't credit the original artist. Is that okay? Is there some threshold that gets crossed where you go from tribute to stealing?"

I've since changed my mind because I actually believe that the USMNT actually is very relevant to league even if it's not so obvious as a call up for a New England player or something. 

I caught the game ball at Crew Stadium which is the home stadium of my favorite sports team in the world. The ball was kicked by an MLS player and both goals were scored by MLS players. I do think you are correct that the majority of conversation should be very specific to MLS. I think topics like USA and Canadian national teams are refreshing and relevant to out league.

Running isn't strength work for your legs (unless you're doing sprints).  If you enjoy it or feel like you get something out of it thats fine, but its the equivalent of waving your arms in the air in the hopes of making them stronger.

The_White_Baron,cheatatmathhomework,1390759702.0,"You can find it explicitly by writing A = (a,b,c,d).

A^(2) = [a^(2) + bc, b(a + d), c(a + d), bc + d^(2)]

A^(2) - A = [a^(2) - a + bc, b(a + d - 1), c(a + d - 1), bc + d^(2) - 1]

The only way the equality can hold is if each entry is equal (i.e. A^(2) - A = -I = (-1,0,0,-1). So you get four equations in four unknowns:

* a^(2) - a + bc = -1
* b(a + d - 1) = 0
* c(a + d - 1) = 0
* bc + d^(2) - d = -1

We have two cases. 1st case: b = c = 0 and a + d - 1 != 0. Then our equations reduce to

* a^(2) - a = -1
* d^(2) - d = -1

All this tells us is a = d.  Or A = xI, where x is some constant to be determined.

Then you can find this constant by returning to your equation:

x^(2)I - xI + I = 0, and as riboch noted, this is an ordinary quadratic equation that you can solve for in x.

****

The other possibility is that a + d - 1 = 0, or a + d = 1, and b != 0 and c != 0.

The equations become a little more complex, but you *can* solve them.

* a^(2) - a + bc = -1
* bc + d^(2) - d = -1
* a + d = 1

Three equations in four unknowns (underdetermined system with infinitely many solutions), so as riboch noted, you have a whole family of solutions."

We live in *fucking England* and it's *fucking windy* and yet she has decided to not *give a shit* that *maybe* her hair might attack my *fucking face*. But his face remained calm. There was no hint of annoyance in his features, a true portrait of the British stiff upper lip. 

She always wore her hair down, never a chiffon or ringlets. Never a messy bun or a ponytail. It was down and remained down, a golden curtain across her back and it took all of his will power today to not tie it in a *fucking bun* you *fucking moron*. 

For some reason fate had decided their schedules would align perfectly, and so they always share the same park bench during their lunch break. They knew of each other of course. They were 3 computer desks over from each other in the office, which means work dos and gossip. Polite tea offerings and polite greetings in the corridors. But she was prim and proper and he always held an air of bachelor about him. Stubble that never goes away and a tie that never ties quite right; she always thought he was the ""guy from the office"" and could therefore not imagine getting to know him on a deeper, personal level. The feeling was mutual.  

How odd, he thought, that one of us is always at the bench before the other. And yet the second one to arrive always parks their arse upon the park bench anyway. It's not like we make eye contact across the park, we never have a speedwalk race, there's never a winner. It's just simply one arriving 5 minutes, 2 minutes, 30 seconds before and looking as if they  have always been there.

&gt; In early Sweden such surnames also were not fixed, but changed from 
generation to generation. Such patronyms gradually declined as a proportion of all 
surnames, as families adopted more permanent surnames in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. The 1901 Naming Law called for each family to have a family 
surname passed unchanged across generations, thus freezing in place these 
previously changing patronyms.

I find this concerning due to the other circumstances- your depression, addiction problems, and the lack of intimacy in our relationship (side note: I would specifically discuss intimacy instead of sex, because you indicated that he's not even particularly affectionate, which is an even bigger warning sign than lack of sex.)

OlderThanGif,linux,1390762529.0,"So processors conform to *architectures*. The most common desktop architecture these days is x64 (previously x86). ARM is a more popular architecture (not on the desktop) and is used in your smartphone, for instance. And there are more architectures.

You can consider a processor *core* to be a particular implementation of an architecture. Whereas the x64 architecture specification is fairly public information and will give a list of all the instructions and what they do, etc., a specific implementation of that (a specific Intel chip) will have to decide *how* to implement the architecture. Most chips (especially from Intel and AMD) are tightly guarded trade secrets. ARM will sell you a licence for a particular chip (if you want to manufacture it) but it's still a proprietary licence and probably quite expensive.

Then there are free implementations of processors. OpenRISC is one. OpenSPARC is another. These are processors written in a language like Verilog or VHDL, which describes every operation of the processor down to the individual logic gates. It's also what's used to manufacture the chips into physical things.

Many enthusiasts like open implementations like OpenRISC because (a) there's limited opportunity for NSA-likes to slip in naughty things; and (b) you get the usual freedoms to tinker and share like you do with free software.

The downside to using OpenRISC is that very few people in the world actually have the capital to manufacture a CPU. It requires a lot of very expensive equipment and expertise to do that. Most people using OpenRISC are either using FPGAs or are actually just running OpenRISC emulators (like is happening in this link)"

IOIM,Accounting,1390762636.0,"I'm currently in my third year and are now taking all business courses.  Note this set up is based on the fact that I'm in the Masters program and also I don't know about other schools, but for mine, it's basically you take intro to accounting with no other accounting courses firstly.  Then move on to intermediate accounting (also known as Financial Reporting) + managerial.  Then you generally move on to second semester intermediate accounting + cost [note- this isn't required for some uni's], or some people change out the intermediate for audit, tax, or systems -- or add one of these too for the semester for 3 accounting courses -- I changed it out for tax, and will be doing 2nd intermediate in summer.  Then you go on to advanced financial reporting and add whatever you haven't done yet (ie audit, tax, or systems).  Then I go on for my Masters stuff, which will probably be much different than what you will experience.

So generally you will take 2 or 3 accounting courses each semester (with the rest being misc business course), but definitely take advantage of summers and winters.  Once I got into the business school, I've tried to keep my credits at 12 in order to always get over a B -- and then take 2 or 3 classes in the summer and one in winter to make up for that.  I'm not saying that's the best way, that's just what works for me -- I don't get breaks, but there's never a point when I'm extremely stressed.  

But anyway, to specifically answer these questions:

&gt; how many general business courses I'll have to take each semester

This varies from school to school, but we had to take 7 general business courses total - how many per semester is however you set it all up

&gt; how much room I'll have to take courses I like

Depends.  If the courses you like are related to business, ie Finance and MHR, it's highly likely you'll have to take these anyway.  If it includes outside business courses like a foreign language or an english class, that'll be more difficult and you'll probably want to take those before getting into the business school."

Starwhisperer,piano,1390763192.0,"Thank you for your essay! 

I guess, it really just depends on the teacher then. And how they facilitate your progress. My experiences with piano lessons, from what I remember, as a kid, was me going to the lesson, playing a song and passing or not passing to the next song. But it was a piano school, so there were many kids there at one time. And the teacher would be with me for maybe 5-10 minutes.  My second teacher in high school was a bit better, but not so much that I probably wouldn't have been able to read up on it by myself if I wanted to.  
  
Again, I appreciated your answer and your own set of experiences! And, your opinion that classical music is probably not the most complex, but is probably the most technically straight-forward is a good observation. I didn't think of it that way, and when someone puts it like that, it might make some sense to learn it first. It's similar to when someone says to learn ballet before delving into other dance styles. I understand what they're getting at, but ballet and hip-hop are two totally different things."

They both drank water and before they ordered, the mom asked me all sorts of questions about pricing... if they got these two items, plus tax how much it would be... or if they got these two items instead, plus tax, would it be cheaper? etc... and when her daughter asked for a chocolate milk, she said not that day but maybe another time. You could tell she was really struggling with money but wanted to bring her daughter out for a nice meal. Anyway, when it was all said and done, their ticket came to a few bucks short of $20. 


When they were finished, instead of bringing their check, I brought over a chocolate milk in a to-go cup and told her their bill was already taken care of. The mom asked me why/who paid for it, and I told her the person who paid asked me not to tell.


It was the best $16 I've ever spent.

*Continuing from last week:*

**Uchouten Kazoku** - Very interesting so far, especially after the first two episodes or so. Plus, I really like the art style, character design, and premise.

**Maoyuu Maou Yuusha** - Who doesn't like an anime than mixes fanservice and informational segments about four-field crop rotation? This is a curious series, for sure, but I am enjoying it.

**Sword Art Online** - Haven't made as much progress as I was planning on, but still continuing with it.

**Hataraku Maou-sama** - Rewatching this, because it is great.

*Finished this week* - 

**Arakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge** - Wow. Finished this series this week, and man, those last six or so episodes are crazy. And brilliant.

OriginalStomper,pics,1390763965.0,"&gt; Instant recall and complete ownership and management of production by the workers would do away with that almost entirely.

How does any system give workers the competence and foresight needed for planning?  How does that cause workers to *care* enough to utilize these resources *in addition* to the grind of just showing up for work every day?  How do the workers at *this* plant resolve their differences with *that* plant about which plant has priority access to limited resources?  Who breaks the ties when two competing plants disagree about which should have priority?  Who decides when the plant manufacturing incandescent light bulbs has outlived its usefulness, so it must be shut down and all its workers trained for new jobs?  How much time and energy should the workers spend lobbying with the decision-makers to try and have their own priorities prevail?

Most workers don't care enough about anything sort of closing their plant, and will defer to the person who does care, particularly if that person demonstrates any talent at all for making and/or implementing those decisions.  That person becomes the de facto leader, and if people don't begin cutting him or her slack for the rest of the work so s/he can focus on the planning, then the leader eventually has to demand the extra time needed to do the planning properly.

Point is, history and sociology show us most workers don't want that responsibility and will give it away rather than own it and use it.

&gt;add to that the availability of macro information online of everyone

Universal availability does not mean universal use.  Most people will not take the time and expend the energy to access it, much less analyze it and figure out how to use it.  The minority with the energy and tools to do so will be *given* responsibility for doing so.  This is the nature of a specialized economy.

&gt;Why do you think there are more functional political systems in advanced countries than there are in developing countries?

The answer to that question is far more complex and nuanced than your oversimplification.  But one factor is specialization.

Specialization is nearly always more efficient than general application.  A factory that specializes in making incandescent light bulbs is going to be more efficient at that task than a factory that makes incandescent light bulbs AND double-paned windows.

Likewise, a talented machinist will be more efficient and productive if s/he spends all working hours making tools than if s/he must spend some working hours studying the issues, data, industry developments, and availability of resources needed for planning things like:  acquisition of supplies, distribution of the machined tools, long-term capital investment in new equipment and facilities -- or is it better to repair the current facilities and hope the current equipment is not obsoleted by another plant with newer technology?  People who specialize in making these decisions are generally going to be better at identifying the needed information and then making the decisions IF they are given the time and resources to do so.
"
hylandw,DnD,1390763975.0,"**Name:** Mundane Enchantments

**Building type:** Shop (Enchanter)

**Building Description:** This small shop is run by an old half-elf wizard by the name of Thomm Horne. He frequently hires students of wizardry to help him with enchantments. However, as these are students, some enchantments tend to go awry. The occasional blast of light, explosion, or loud shouts can be heard from the back room of the shop. The small front room is full of shelves with scrolls and small enchanted trinkets, as well as a ""bargain bin"" with failed enchantments. Although they can sell pre-enchanted items, most simply browse the scrolls for a desired enchantment and bring in an item.

**Creatures:** At any one time, there could be at least ten small animals and creatures wandering about the store. The old wizard has a snowy owl, and the helpers who come and go can have any number of creatures with them. Thomm Horne is currently being assisted by a dwarf named Dorin (who has two cats, one black and one white) and a human named Alyss (Who is accompanied by a rather overlarge wolf).

**Adventure hooks:** The old wizard is always looking for pet projects, help, and rare books and items.

**Other:** It's worth noting that the shop's back room, from the outside, doesn't seem to exist. Wizards who have worked there simply aren't bothered by it, as many colleges have these kinds of rooms, but non-magical folk can get quite curious.

Also, watch out for that snowy owl. I heard he likes to attack Kender."

And his mom and dad basically treated me like the daughter they never had so I finally had a safe home again. (My mom was/is an alcoholic, my dad's place was my safe place.) "

In fact, if I were to try to go any lower, I'd be hitting the safeties on the rack. 

Here's a video of me squatting low bar:

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390765431.0,"&gt;I really think Link wasn't even needed for anything more than his Light Arrows in that game.

But why is that supposed to be a good thing, regardless of gender roles? It's exactly what bugged me about the whole Elizabeth mechanic in Bioshock. So what now, it turns the game into ""Do menial tasks while somebody plays an exciting audiobook or movie next to you?"". =&gt; to me that sounds even worse than the always complained about ""cut scenes intercut with action bits"". 

While it is true that it's hard to gamify certain things and it is easier to make non-player characters go through arcs, to me all that means: ""well then games still have to work harder on how to craft their narratives"" rather than just settling on letting the (usually male) player character do pointless (as the narrative downplays it) lifting while designating females to non-interactive storyline deliverers. 

As a concept, that still sounds plenty of shit to me. 

Sure, a lot of games like to use the plot device of the player having been just a patsy or having been lied to or jerked around be the quest giver (because it fits just so well on a meta level) but now, just because somebody decided that male=action and female=storyline was a thing now, we are now supposed to accept that/consider that a good thing? Rather than the game using the more natural reaction of the player getting pissed at the one who pulls the strings? 

(for the record, I'm not disliking Skyward Sword or its storyline, I'm just highly skeptical whether this story telling structure is necessarily something that is good for gaming in general or that much of a pinnacle for female characters)

The whole amazing thing about games is that they let you play through things and experience things. So if a game's narrative supposedly tells me that what this other characters is doing is supposedly so much more cool and so much more important than what I'm doing =&gt; I'm sorry, doesn't that kind of suck? Dangling the candy in front of your face but not actually bothering to make this thing which is supposedly so awesome actually interactive and experience-able? To me that means that: 

1.) Either the game is lying and what it pretends is actually awesome/important is actually not that awesome and important 

2.) It is awesome and important and the game is keeping it away from me because it is too lazy to think of new mechanics 

[to me this is a fairly gender neutral issue, the same issue would still be the case if Tomb Raider tried to argue that Sam is much more fascinating than Lara or if the genders of Link and Zelda or Booker and Elizabeth were switched; The idea of declacing the non-playble/supporting character the ""real"" main character/the more exicting character just sounds like an overall terrible idea]

Is this really where games should be going? Congratulations, you get to play the camera guy in this really exciting documentary! "

I'd go as far as to say Bleach, Incesticide (which isn't really an album but whatever) and some of In Utero is underrated because of Nevermind. Nirvana before Nevermind was perfect in capturing the apathy that the younger people at the time were feeling. They were about just being. Nevermind was their attempt to gain become more mainstream but I feel like Cobain hated a lot of the people that came with their new popularity, it changed who they were.

They usually consign big lots of other peoples stuff allowing you to look through lots of different inventory without lurking hundreds of yard sales googling everything on your phone as you come across them. You can find great items at auction houses I recently bought and sold 600+ dollars worth of magic cards I bought for 40 bucks. Could this have happened at goodwill or a yardsale? Yea definitely but the chances are slim and the gas and time it would take to find something like that are not worth the effort. I'm also a broke college student and so far this has been the most consistently profitable way to flip items with minimal effort.

It worked very well, and we stayed in there for about an hour. We could hear my mother and his father calling for us, but we thought it was all fun and games so we kept hiding. After a while we came out because we were getting sore from staying in the same position. When we came out, our parents had called the police because they genuinely thought we had gone missing. They also lived right near a lake, so there were cops looking around the lake thinking that we might have fallen in. Needless to say, since I was older I got the blame, and had to write a letter of apology to my friend's father for worrying him, and my parents punished me at home. I still think about and regret that day.

Willravel,startrek,1390766442.0,"It's a very, very old battle between optimism and pessimism, but ultimately it's about choices, but individually and collectively. I sincerely believe that humanity has the potential to reach the utopian future imagined by Roddenberry, or at least something like that, but it will take a collective decision that the status quo, which is more akin to Moore's darker humanity, is not tenable in the long-run. 

My guess is that, eventually, humanity will be around long enough to start looking at the bigger picture on a collective level. Right now our various systems‚Äîeconomic, political, social, etc.‚Äîtend to only view things in the short term because of how the systems are designed. Political solutions are seen within the context of what can be done in the next 2-4 years. Economic solutions, especially in the more crony capitalist systems, are geared toward short term profits. Social changes, even, are generally only seen as being by the time it takes for another generation to come around, some 20-30 years. As we mature as a species, however, especially when life-extending technologies make long-term thinking more advantageous, we're going to necessarily adapt. That's when questions of where humanity will be in 500 years will suddenly be relevant to day to day life for most people, not just dreamers and philosophers.

bechampions,soccer,1390766523.0,"This is probably going to get buried but I have several:

*England, Scotland, Wales, and N. Ireland shouldn't play as separate national teams or have their own separate leagues. If they're allowed to do so then why shouldn't Spain should be broken up into Catalunya, Galicia, Andalusia, etc? Same with MLS, Canada should have their own league.

*Speaking of MLS, They should have a system of promotion and relegation and get rid of franchises. I know this is done for financial reasons, but it seems ironic that the ultimate capitalist country in the world runs their sports leagues under communist like values (franchises, salary caps, collective bargaining agreements, TV blackouts, etc)

*The naturalization process for footballers should be stricter than that of other citizens, particularly if they want to play for their adopted country's national team. If a player is born and raised in say Brazil, learns his trade there and immigrates to say Korea, becomes a citizen and plays for the Korean team, he is not a reflection of the talent being brought up in the country but rather a player who had no shot of getting on the Brazillian squad and instead chose to represent a country where he has been playing for anywhere from 1-5 years. National teams should reflect the quality of talent being brought up in that country, and not the talent that the country can recruit from other nations. 

Spain and Barcelona related:
 
*Tiki taka is unbelievably boring. 

*Gerard Pique is overrated and only looks good because Barcelona's style of play is possession based and their backline is not often exposed. 

*Xavi is what makes Barcelona and Spain so good. It's a shame to see Messi get so much credit for Barcelona's success as Xavi is the guy running the show. Him and Iniesta got Spain the World Cup and Messi has had little success with Argentina because he doesn't have Xavi playing with him.

The poverty is caused by the poor education, which in turn leaves the older generations unable to provide a better education for subsequent generations, thus perpetuating the cycle. IMO the religiosity of these regions is a simple outgrowth of this; when your life is shit it's quite tempting to think that this is only temporary, and thinking that the Heavenly Kingdom awaits you after death is probably quite comforting to these people. This then feeds into these issues. Think about it; if you've been taught that by adhering to these standards you will have some kind of reward after you die, would you be willing to risk that for your children by teaching something like evolution and risk their immortal souls? It has a tragic internal logic to it, unfortunately, and, when viewed in the right sociological context actually seems to be the most rational course of action. "

As far as sensitivity, try to play with as high sensitivity as you feel comfortable with, and let aim assist do the precise aiming for you.

Correct.  The deficit is spending money we don't have.  Until we don't have a deficit, canceling a program does not allow us to pay for other things - it simply reduces how much money we are spending that we don't have.

When the $650 billion deficit no longer exists, then we can talk about cutting program A to pay for program B.  Until then, cutting program A just means we are going into debt less."

communistslutblossom,AskWomen,1390767068.0,"I bled a bit and sex hurt a LOT for me at first. It's normal but it's not necessarily good. The best way to make it better is to use a lot of lube, engage in plenty of foreplay, and to relax as much as possible. Obviously relaxing is easier said than done, especially when you've already had it hurt once. Relaxing is important because the pain usually comes from tensing up your vaginal muscles. A lot of women/girls (myself included) tense up because they are nervous and because it's a very new/different physical sensation.

For me, the part that helped me relax the most was talking to my boyfriend, having him reassure me that we could go as slowly as I needed, and knowing that I could trust him to be understanding. Another thing that helps is having put his fingers inside you first -- if two fingers feels tight, then a penis definitely will too, so it's good to try that first. You can also get a dildo/vibrator that is bigger than a couple fingers but smaller than his penis to work your way up to the sensation of having him inside you.

Just so you know, sex was extremely painful for me at first, but now it doesn't hurt at all unless I haven't had sex for a while, and even then it only hurts a tiny bit. I (and many others I've talked to who experienced pain at first), have come to really enjoy sex and I'm sure you will too!"

dreadfulpennies,52book,1390767215.0,"I finished up **The Silver Metal Lover** by Tanith Lee and then started on **Black Heart** by Holly Black.

The Silver Metal Lover was my favorite thing I've ever read by Tanith Lee. I feel like she writes in a really unreal, dreamlike kind of style, and the whole story really suited it. Not sure what 40 people on goodreads are thinking, though. The protagonist was a teen, but never in a million years would I shelve this as YA. She's written YA books before, but I would not call this one of them. Meanwhile, in actual YA territory...

I'll probably finish up Black Heart tonight. It's the last book in the Curse Workers series and, like all the books I've ever read by Holly Black, it is okay. She is a consistently okay writer. I'm not sure whether that's a compliment or not, but it keeps me coming back to her books... but only if they're on clearance or at the library. It's definitely more than I can say for a lot of YA authors, I guess.

Primary care is a doctor that you see for your normal, everyday health needs.  Not a specialist.  Primary care can be pediatrics for kids, family practice, internal medicine, and some women use gynecologists as their primary care providers.

Family medicine is a primary care specialty for all ages.  It's like internal medicine and pediatrics combined, with maybe some obstetrics thrown in.

General practice, I'm not quite as sure about.  I think it's synonymous with family medicine.  Perhaps someone here with more knowledge can help out.

One time, I was picking up a first date (I must have been a junior in high school), and had to pull over to use the restroom on the way to the restaurant. It created a cycle, whereby I'd become nervous about bowel pressure, which would trigger bowel pressure. Admittedly, a lot of this was psychological, but still, it turned out there was a large physiological component related to diet. 

The single best benefit, for me, is that this is a thing of the past. The better sleep, the great energy levels, the increase in mental concentration, and such have all been bonuses, but the best thing about Paleo is even when I'm crazy nervous, it never manifests in my digestive system. "

My first lipstick...oh man, I remember it like it was YESTERDAY. My friend Amanda and I were obsessed with makeup around age 10. Our parents didn't like it because well, we didn't know how to apply it and basically ran around looking like little hookers with bright blue eyeshadow and lipgloss. We found a giant jar of quarters in my grandmothers house and asked her for some of it for 'candy'. Candy, was code for 'secret makeup splurge'. We had never bought lipstick, we had only really ever used her grandmothers eyeshadows to play. Well there it was. This wet and wild lipstick and it was BLUE. Like BABY BLUE (hell yea 90s!). So I of COURSE had to have it (I was already a little grunge/punk rat at age 10 *listless sigh*) I was BROKEN HEARTED to learn that it was, in fact, Wet and Wild color changing lipstick. This junk turned baby pink. That was NOT what I wanted damn it. I wanted BLUE. So I went on my quest for blue lipstick...and I still don't have one. This contest speaks to me. LOL!"

And how did the coral reefs survive without the necessary amount of sunlight in proportion to the depth of the water? In fact, a vast majority of aquatic life would likely die from stress alone.

But then again, shepherds back then had no idea how living things actually functioned and probably assumed the limit of complexity to water was that it was just wet stuff fish and plants need to survive. Plenty of people today don't even know you can kill a fish by immediately tossing it out of a plastic bag into its fishtank or that plants can die from being over-watered."

You're whining and complaining about the ""rocket-rackets"" as though the people who do fire them are doing so for no reason or to be ""terrorists"". I bet you are sufficiently deluded to actually believe that, or any other sort of garbage that talking heads in the IDF PR department shit out-- Palestinian ""terrorists"", we're not to blame for anything, Palestinians don't want peace and want to kill the jews, etc.

Just a load of vile rubbish.

&gt; are quite proud of what they're doing.

Proud of their ability to continue to respond to how Israel behaves and what Israel does? Considering the odds stacked against them, I can see that. 

I've no love for Hamas--  not because of Israeli lies about them and other Israeli bullshit, mind you-- but they are resilient.

What's more, you're not going to make people in Gaza really hate them when they see infinite more reason to blame you Israelis, and rightly so, for their homes and lives being destroyed, and their perpetual malnourishment. 

&gt; And you want to deny all of it?

I'm denying the lying and spineless Israeli/non-Israeli Jewish narrative about the situation, as anyone with a brain/understands the situation will do.

&gt; Whatever happened to solidarity...

Lol, bugger off. Solidarity isn't any one thing, you know. It's a lot different then the ""stand with us and suck tiny jewish penis all day every day"" sort of thing that pro-Israel people try to promote.

Natla,AskWomen,1390768603.0,"My first real boyfriend was horrible to me since the beginning. The relationship lasted from when I was 13 until 18 and he was 15-20 (with a first breakup right after my 17th b-day). In the beginning it wasn't that bad but I noticed everything had to be about him, whatever we were going to do had to be what he wanted. And if he didn't get his way he would say that I must not love him. Then it started to get bad when I was around 16. He would call me stupid/retarded and call me a ""bum"" because I didn't have a job (which I was still in high school). He would get mad at me if I didn't want to go out with him to places because I didn't have any money, and then he would get mad that he would have to pay for me. I was also getting really depressed and he would call me crazy and threaten to dump me if I ""didn't fix myself fast enough"". I would ask him to just listen to how I feel and he would tell me that it wasn't his problem and didn't care. 

He then dumped me after my 17th birthday and about 6 months later we got back together (bad idea). It just ended up worse and he cheated on me with my best friend (they are now together). He also told me that the reason why he got back together with me was just so he could fuck me. I'm also pretty sure he was cheating on me with at least 2 other girls (who were also supposed to me my friends). Oh! And sometimes he would threaten to mess with my birth control to make me pregnant (he was/is kinda baby crazy!)

I then started seeing this guy who I ended up crazy for. We lasted about 5 months but I could tell I was sorta just a sex toy for him. He ended up dumping me one night right after sex, like no joke I was still naked and hadn't even gone to bathroom yet and he dumped me! 

I'm now with my current boyfriend who is just great! I don't feel pressured by him, he encourages me, loves me, supports me, listens to me when I'm down. We have so much fun together it is unbelievable. The issue is now, that even though he is so great and hasn't shown any reason for me to not trust him, I still have problems from what happened before. I sometimes feel I will never be good enough (even though he tells me I couldn't be any greater). I guess I just have some trust issues now unfortunately. But my boyfriend shows me everyday how much he loves me and he has never let me down so I'm definitely getting better at realizing that not everyone is going to treat me like shit :). "

SpecialSharpie1230,AskReddit,1390769252.0,"I was 17 and a senior and honestly had no idea what to expect. We went back to her place after skipping our last class for a few hours of alone time. She wasn't a virgin but I was but she didn't know that. The blowjob didn't get me anywhere, and she had an orgasm when I went down on her. We proceeded to flip through every position we could in a few hours and I still couldn't finish despite not wearing a condom. It took a couple more times before I finally could."
Norimw,RandomActsofMakeup,1390769258.0,Welcome! Do you own any make up currently? If so what do you have? And what do you like most?
TheCaptainBlast,nba,1390769263.0,"That's tough for me, because when healthy and in his prime, he probably was the best center ever to play the game. He was so dominant defensively--like a bigger Bill Russell and then ran the offense on the other end. But, in terms of greatness, I don't know. The prime I'm mentioning only lasted a season and a half, so it's tough to call him ""great."""
Floppyboobsack,bicycletouring,1390769264.0,"I took my phone on a west coast tour last year instead of my Garmin. Even though I picked a small phone with decent battery life I had to have it plugged into my spare external battery pack nearly 24/7. I like having access to data like speed and distance and all this was a pain on just the phone. Not to mention having to put it away in the rain. FTR I also had a tablet and a ultrabook with me (I like my gadgets). I am not a fan of overpriced devices for the sake of them, but honestly even my old Garmin Oregon 300 would have been much better on the trip."
Renner1,worldpolitics,1390769267.0,"Does that constitute the beginning of some ""epic battle"" if they do actually pull something off, or try to pull something of?

Will it be some pretext for Putin to go into Chechnya or Dagestan and start killing a lot of people who hate the Caucasus Emirate more then Putin or Russians do, or ever could?

I mean, this is one of those things where one can very easily say that Russia really screwed up in the last 25 years and sort of made its bed on this, right? Especially in terms of how destructive they were in the first war and everything that entailed.

OriginalStomper,pics,1390770298.0,"&gt;So you are saying that workers who's livelihood is based on their place of work simply would be too uninterested in running it?

History shows that workers are motivated to maximize their own quality of life in the short-term, even at the expense of making their business unsustainable.  This is not unique to blue-collar workers.

Wall-street types do the same thing, maximizing quarterly profits to meet ""productivity"" goals at the cost of the company's long-term health.  Most people will not make sacrifices for the sake of *potential* long-term benefits if they can obtain more certain short-term benefits with equal or fewer sacrifices.

But yes, management is a specialized skill that benefits from training, education, talent and experience.  You contend otherwise, don't you?

&gt;basically workers could never manage themselves

They absolutely *could* manage themselves.  But not nearly as well as someone trained to do so, who has demonstrated a talent for management, and who is given the resources (including full-time commitment) needed to do so.  Generalization is extremely inefficient.  Do you dispute that?

The corollary to ""do what you love and success will follow"" is that people are very unlikely to be successful (in the long run) at tasks they loathe.  Given freedom to choose (an unattainable ideal, I know), people will tend toward the tasks they find the most rewarding, and avoid the tasks that they find least rewarding.  Those who do not have the talent, education, resources and training for management will not be good at it, nor find it rewarding.  Those people will avoid management."

Because multiple other qualities may trump that person's opinion on marijuana. Weed is as much my ""lifestyle"" as porn. It isn't. It is something I enjoy doing however. People have jobs, kids, family, and hobbies that they may enjoy and allow to dominate their character, lives and relationships.

I suppose Google could request and cache the image upon receiving an email to prevent such a solution from being very effective (since all their Gmail e-mails will show the pixel as being request exactly one time), but that still keeps marketing information coming from non-Gmail users. Depending on how much of their information comes from those, it might just provide the mistaken impression everyone is reading those (and as mentioned in the article, increase spam to those people since they read the spam already, according to their tracking statistics).

If you're going to take that argument, almost everything about Christianity is unnecessary, since all we *really* need is faith and baptism.  Hymns are unnecessary, churches are unnecessary, clergy are unnecessary, prayer is unnecessary, the bible is unnecessary...

Suddenly, EVERY OTHER POST was about cheat days. Having heat days, recovering from cheat days, things to eat on cheat days. It went against the purpose of the sub as a whole - which is not eating carbs.  You should not need to ask about them, just use the search function and you'll find a trove of people asking about it.Secondly, this sub as a whole realized that to help people, we need to treat carbs as an addiction. Would you ask a recovering alcoholic about havog a drink just once? No. That's cruel. Why ask a bunch of recovering carb addicts about eating carbs?Also, as far as carbs go in your normal diet, there is wiggle room for most people. It's not a matter of earning your 50g of carbs per day, it's that YOU personally can handle it and stay in ketosis. 20g is the recommended limit because everyone can hit ketosis at that amount. Many people, but not all, can consume 30-50g/day and stay in ketosis. It's all about personal experimentation."

famouscomposer,MensRights,1390772337.0,"So, what then?  You think a man she be allowed to tell a woman to have an abortion?  What it comes down to is the fact that a woman ultimately has control over her own body, and that's not going to change.  As a man, when you have sex with someone it's your own responsibility to be prepared for a child to be conceived and born.  Maybe it doesn't seem fair, since she can decide to abort it and you can't make that decision, but the major difference here is that she can prevent a human life from being brought into existence.  You don't, and will never have that choice.  So you want the option to just not have any responsibility toward the child that is 50% of your own DNA, and you have a 50% share of conceiving?

In the man's case, he's bailing on a child.  In the woman's case, there is no victim.  When a parent decides not to be a parent to a child that already has been born, it hurts the child."

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390772589.0,"Oh sure.  I used to hang around in my work clothes way later than I wanted to look ""presentable"" for sex, but I did get resentful if I did and nothing happened.  Or my husband would get home from work and go straight to the pajama pants and it was like ""Oh, I guess he's not into sex tonight.""

But eventually we both realized this was silly.  I don't find him hot because he's in a suit (although suits are TOTALLY hot) and he doesn't find me hot because I'm in some librarian-lookin' getup.  I mean, yes, that's hot, but ultimately if we want to fuck each other, we're as desirable in our pajamas as we are in clothes because god dammit, we're gonna get naked no matter what, right?

I did used to hold to this idea that if sex were to happen it had to be when we were both looking great, but that's not realistic in a marriage.  My husband is currently blowing snot out of his nose every 30 seconds because he caught the cold of doom that I had four days ago, and he still managed to force me to my knees and fuck my mouth the minute I walked in the door.

Sorry for the TMI, but the point is issues about clothes and presentation are excuses.  My husband has a terrible cold and still managed to work up a hot scene for us.  If people wanna fuck each other, they're attracted to each other in any kind of getup and that shouldn't stand in the way of sex.  I'm not convinced the OP really wants to fuck his wife.  A lot of replies are assuming she's rejecting him, but he's actually the LL in the situation.  He won't initiate, and uses ""cues"" from her as excuses for not doing it.  If he wanted her, he'd fuck her, and he's not."
techmeister,ShingekiNoKyojin,1390772603.0,"The Gang eventually finds Grisha hanging out in a cabin doing science-y shit, stabilizing the agent that allows a human to be modified into a shifter, and also having a more or less developed plan to combat the Titans(maybe devolve them back down to humans, maybe not. That may be a little far fetched) back in the basement. So begins the Titan Corps as a part of the Survey Corps, where volunteers are injected and become shifters/learn how to gain complete control of their Titans and their handlers, whom they are intimately familiar with, help lead them to whatever their objective it and try to protect them.

Using the Titan Corps, Shigshina is retaken and Wall Maria is resecured, but not at high cost. Kill off a few characters here, maybe Levi dying doing something awesome that makes the mission a success, and with his last words, says something cryptic and inspiring.  Grisha comes in with the rest of the Survey corps and gets to work on whatever's in the basement, turns out it's a bioweapon that kills the Titans in most cases, but devolves them in some cases(say 15-20% of the time). 

With the Survey Corps leading the charge, humanity begins to colonize outside the walls, hitting the Titans with the bioweapon as they encounter them until they hit the ocean and start port cities and begin exploring the world.  

Connie becomes a famous captain, responsible for getting humans to various different areas of settlement and charting over a quarter of the globe himself before sailing into a massive storm and never being heard from again. Jean becomes the sheriff of a port town, fulfilling his dreams of being a cop, but gets killed in the line of duty. Mikasa and Eren have a baby that they name Carla, Grisha injects Eren with another Agent that neutralizes the shifter ability. Sasha pioneers fast food. Historia becomes a wanderer who roams the world going from settlement to settlement searching for Ymir before she just gets shot in the chest by some highwaymen. Berthold and Reiner are captured and interrogated as to their motives. They're injected with the neutralizer and tested to see if their Titan abilities remain.

Ideally, I'd run black/red alongside blue because red can burn creatures/opponents and black has great removal and a good creature base. I'd also use these colors to shore up any weaknesses in blue's matchups.  I'd also consider pairing up with white due to heroic counters, but that also depends on your card pool. It seems like you're afraid of not having creatures in the early game, so pick a color that can fill in the gap- white and red (for me) would do nicely.

The problem is that you are not completely evacuating your rectum. There are a variety of approaches to fixing this but a really easy one is to eat some psyllium fiber ([example product](http://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Psyllium-Capsules-180-Count/dp/B000MGR2T4)) with every meal. It's not likely to make you gassy like many other kinds of fiber. Take 2-6 pills at least with breakfast and dinner, and you can also try with lunch. You'll see results within a day, as soon as that food makes its way through your system.

bigtcm,TrueAskReddit,1390773195.0,"&gt; they often had identity problems in school or otherwise...they don't really fit in with either of their two racial groups

I think most, if not all ethnic minorities will experience identity problems growing up. Hell, doesn't every teenager, regardless of ethnicity, go through identity problems in high school? I certainly did. 

At my first workplace, I was the only Asian guy there. My coworkers (and boss too!) would playfully make fun of the fact that I was in the token Asian guy, working in a company of white people, serving a predominantly Mexican population. If I were in a similar situation as a teenager, I'd definitely try my best to fit in. Now, I almost embrace the token Asian guy role. Like I said above, it's all about making people familiar with the culture, so it's no longer weird or strange to them and there's nothing left to make fun of. If they can see that this guy with the oddly shaped eyes and the dark hair is just...human...like everyone else, then the Asian thing isn't worth talking about.

Again, in my opinion, I think racial groups are silly. I understand that many racial groups stick together due to common interest; Chinese people want to stick together to talk in Chinese, or they want to talk about current events in Asia that most Americans don't care about, or they want to talk about Asian pop music that again, most Americans don't care about. However, in our rapidly intertwining global community, I find that many of these interests cross racial lines. One of my classmates in my Chinese class in college was Black. She spoke some of the best Chinese I've ever heard because apparently her father worked in the Chinese embassy and she spent most of her childhood in China. I'm an Asian man, and I'm a huge fan of American sports - I grew up watching the NBA, and I'm a frequent commenter over at /r/nfl. 

As far as biracial goes, that's awesome! You have two different cultures you can fall back on, show off, and experience! I have a friend who is Filipino and his wife is Vietnamese. How lucky are those kids going to be! They get legit lumpia and lechon to go with moon cakes and new year's rice cakes for the Tet festival.

**Most importantly though...Chinese/white people are gorgeous.**

For example, when I say I support abortion and someone tells me that I'm an idiot and deserve to die for thinking that it's ok to kill a baby, I just want to slap them for forcing someone who is having a disabled child or was, God forbid raped, to carry him or her into the world. Just my opinion, I'm entitled to it, but I wish people would think more about the future implications rather than get lost in a sea of political correctness."

POGtastic,AskReddit,1390773941.0,"&gt; And no, I will not go to a psychiatrist.

Say you fall down the stairs and break your leg. Do you attempt to set the bone yourself, or do you go to the hospital? It's a no-brainer; you don't know the first thing about fixing your leg, and there's someone who has studied and trained for the better part of his life to fix legs.

Your brain is no different. There's something wrong right now - you're miserable and are definitely not enjoying life. Why wouldn't you want that to be fixed?

In some cases, fixing whatever's wrong might require medication. That's okay - people take medication for diabetes, kidney problems, heart problems, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and infections. There's nothing wrong with it, and assholes who refer to them as ""crazy pills"" need to die in a fire. In other cases, a psychiatrist can help you with the below:

Now - if you're really, really set on doing it yourself, there are a few things you can do.

1. Exercise. ""Hit the gym"" is cliche, but it really works. It doesn't really have anything to do with the exercise itself; it's that you're working to improve yourself. Dedicating yourself to a regimen, sticking to it, and seeing results tells you, ""I did this. I'm proud of myself.""

2. Figure out what you really don't like about yourself. And no, this isn't an exercise in self-pity. You don't get to go, ""I'm worthless, I'm a loser, I can't do X, Y, and Z right."" *Why* do you feel worthless? And then fix it. If you can't fix it, then *ignore it* and find something that you *can* fix.

3. Find things that you can take pride in. What are you good at? And no, you don't get to say, ""I'm not good at anything."" You play computer games, right? What things do those require to be good at them? For example, WoW emphasizes quick thinking, foresight, planning, attention to detail, and analysis of a lot of information to reach an optimal solution. Counterstrike emphasizes reflexes, dexterity, ability to quickly spot discrepancies, agile thinking, communication, teamwork, and being able to predict your opponents' moves. Find what you're good at and figure out other things that will come easily to you. For example, if you're really good at predicting your opponents' moves and understanding strength and weakness of position, you'll probably make a good chess player. Go learn that.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with having geeky habits... but if you only have one or two geeky habits, you're boring. Go get a bunch of other interests too!

Just to take my example - I like programming, chess, math, reading, creative writing, history, beer, karaoke, music, football, weightlifting, and orbital mechanics, to name a few. A lot of these hobbies are really geeky... but I have a *lot* of them. I'm an interesting person to talk to, and people like my depth of knowledge. In contrast, if you only have one or two hobbies, you're boring. Sure, you can talk about that one hobby... but if you're talking to someone who isn't interested in it, you're fucked. I can talk to a lot of people on a lot of different subjects.

The best part is, it's interesting. You know /r/TodayILearned? Do that every day, and you'll become a cool person. You can be awkward, shy, socially anxious, and you'll still be cool because you have lots of stuff to say.

I dunno. It comes down to you. Do you want to change? Well, you have to put the work in. The thing is, *you don't have anything better to do.* So go do some stuff."

Renner1,PropagandaPosters,1390774010.0,"&gt; &gt; Pray tell me then, what's the purose of firing rocket after rocket into residential areas of Sderot, Ashkelon, etc, other than to terrorize or kill the people that live there?

You really think they're doing it for fun? They have nothing better to do?

What's Israel been doing to the Palestinians since 1949, hmm?

Have they stopped importing foreign Jews who have no business living on other people's land?

Have they done anything about the IDF whenever it does something abusive or terrible?

Allowed any of the Palestinians who were ethnically cleansed and expelled to return to the country of their origin?

Barring the fact that-- as I said-- the ""rocket-rackets"" don't go off unless there's some kind of provocation on the part of Israel; maybe they decided to knock down another 500 Palestinian homes in the West Bank to make room for ""settler"" swine, or maybe they shot fishermen in Gaza or tried to pull a targeted assassination or something like that-- then there are plenty of reasons for the firing of rockets. Even if it's to let the Israelis know that they're not going to evaporate or all of a sudden accept ludicrous Israeli ""peace terms"" that no sane person could possibly agree with.

&gt; Do you even realize that I technically haven't even been taking fucking sides here? 

Yeah, some pro-Israel trying to pretend to be neutral or ""impartial"". OK bud.

&gt; All I did was to mention that there happen to be some Palestinians firing rockets.

With the implication ""it's the vicious murderous 'terrorists', they're far worse then anything Israel does or has done"". Right?

So it's not just ""I just mentioned rockets"".

&gt; my friend have been calling me braindead, spineless, vile, a liar and a cocksucker

Do you buy into the official Israeli narrative? Are you one of those people who's ""behind Israel, 110%""?

Or one of those people who thinks that ""the Palestinians are the ones in the way of the peace process""?

&gt; You're making one hell of a case against this - owait, no, you're doing the exact opposite.

Sure, try to not make any sense and to show yourself up in the bargain.


&gt; Nope. Solidarity, apparently, among so-called 'pro-Palestinians', means letting hundreds of thousands of their beloved people rot away as second-class citizens in piss-poor refugee camps all over the Arab world for decades now

How hilarious. This is one of the stupider Israeli ""attack points""-- falsely claiming that people in solidarity with the Palestinians ""don't care about"" or ""ignore"" the circumstances under which Palestinians are treated poorly in parts of other countries, with the Israeli intent to try and accuse the pro-Palestinians of being ""hypocrites"" and to try and pretend that Palestine/Israel isn't the crux of the issue. 

People talk, and consider it an issue, about the situation of Palestinians in other countries living under worse circumstances. 

The Israeli ""point"" is a piss-poor attempt to deflect from the actions of consecutive Israeli governments and other instruments of state over the years, and in general to hilariously accuse people of ""hypocrisy"" and ""singling out Israel"", all despite the fact that Israel is the major problem in terms of displacement of the Palestinians to begin with. 

No one claims that the Arab nations that took in Palestinians are perfect in any way on this particular score, but the Israelis do love to exaggerate and demonize and outright make shit up when it comes to the Palestinians and other Arabs in general.

&gt; crying ""no fair"" and writing another petition to the U.N. every time another fucking Israeli checkpoint closes half an hour early.

And here you are pretending Israel isn't the main problem for the Palestinian people. 
Classy. 

Apparently the UN (which helped create the Israeli state) and resolutions and international laws themselves are all ""anti Semitism"" because Israel isn't partial to and doesn't want to listen to any of them.

3 years of work experience doesn't make you special, not even if it is relevant.  Extracurricular activities don't make you special.  

They're looking for a package.  Your work experience will make you stand out over some others, but there are a lot of people with interesting backgrounds that will also stand out.  These firms have a smorgasbord of the best and the brightest to choose from.  No matter what you've got going for you, you are just another undergrad.

I have colleagues that speak 4 languages, had perfect GPAs, were presidents of this club and that organization, completed double majors with honors and won international business plan competitions.   I have colleagues that had been successful entrepreneurs, world class athletes, or served tours of active duty in the military.

Bottom line is, no one knew what they were doing when they started in public practice.  I've given pep talks to certifiable geniuses because they felt stupid for the first time in their lives when they started work.  No matter how impressive your background, you're one of many.  

So my suggestion to you would be to stop expecting to be everyone's first choice, and start selling yourself properly.  The final call for all of these firms is going to be whether or not you will fit well at their firm.  They don't need a primadonna.  They need good team members who're willing to work hard and *learn*.  It's up to you to sell yourself as that right fit, job hunting is a skill.  The brightest candidate won't get the job without good networking and interview skills, so maybe you need to put a little more effort into that, into the work you're doing now and in the future, and rely less on the work you've done in the past."

Arrested Development is brilliant, and I'll go to bat for the phenomenal 4th season any day of the week. Frasier is my favorite ""traditional"" sitcom; All in the Family is close behind. Malcolm in the Middle is criminally underrated and one of most relatable family sitcoms out there. Archer is remarkably consistent and has one of the best casts ever assembled. 

Still though, Community has to top my list. As someone who goes to a school much closer to the Greendale side of the spectrum than the Berkeley side, I really appreciate how hard Community hits the bullseye. Maybe the events of ""Modern Warfare"" and ""The First Chang Dynasty"" aren't realistic. But the characters, their interactions, and the underlying dysfunctions of the school? For the most part, they're spot-on. 

College has a lot to offer, but it isn't a magical time, or a time to ""just chill out and relax."" Very few schools will ever have much school spirit. It's not a place where you can skip class whenever, text during the entire lecture and still expect to succeed. Even if you're the type of person who's all for drinking and partying, college is not a neverending, carefree parade of those things. All of this, of course, is common sense; but a lot of college-based works of fiction choose to ignore it and offer rose-tinted viewpoints instead. Community gets a whole lot closer to the truth - and everything else, from the writing to the cast, are singularly excellent to boot. 

As for what I dislike about it: the fourth season is obviously less than ideal in spots. Also, there are times when the writers don't seem to know what to do with Chang - particularly in the second season. "

Its main purpose is to increase the urethra's pH so that more sperm survives the trip out. If you have recently ejaculated, then the precum can push even more sperm out. So yes, you can definitely have sperm in precum. However, studies have also shown that ""pulling out"" (in the cases where vaginal intercourse stops after the male ejaculates once) is as effective as condoms in preventing pregnancy. In the end, it's pretty much impossible to impregnate someone with precum, even though it may or may not carry sperm in it.

Of course, the idea of a condom is that you're being careful. If you stop being careful about whose fluids are where, then really the spirit of the idea is gone anyway, so I understand throwing out a condom if you manage to fucker it up.

kickingturkies,AskReddit,1390774624.0,"What do you define as ""current""? Furthermore, how is it possible to bunch in almost all of a medium into one?

Think of it this way (keep in mind I'm assuming you like Disney based on your posting history):

I say ""Except for Finding Nemo I dislike Disney and think it's dumb.""

Then you might follow up with ""Well what have you watched? Disney covers many genres and stories. What about the classics like The Lion King or Mulan?"" 

And then I follow up with ""Well I'm more talking about current Disney shows.""

And then, again like people are following up here to you you might say ""Well what about Frozen or Up? Do you dislike those too? What do you mean by current Disney shows?""

End scenario

Chances are you wouldn't understand how I could seemingly put down the whole array that Disney offers, like I can't quite understand how you're putting down almost all anime. There *are* reasons to not like a medium of course (i.e. you don't like the animation style),  but even those don't make anime bad. It's highly subjective, no?

You shouldn't force yourself to watch things if you don't want to and you're free to have your opinion. But that still doesn't make anime dumb."

One of the really cool things about having a partner is that they help you improve. You want to be a good boyfriend, so you learn things and try to do better. I'm a neater person because my girlfriend gets mad if I leave piss stains on the toilet. I just learned about water softeners because she has a problem with hers. I go to the gym more regularly because I want to look good for her.

A partner gives you purpose. You don't need a partner to have purpose, but it's one of the easiest ways to force yourself to get better. *I can't drop out of college. She'd be disappointed with me.*

Also, having a partner gives a boost to your confidence. I'm a good person. After all, she's dating me and not the tattooed shitbag wearing a Raiders jersey.

OriginalStomper,pics,1390775079.0,"&gt;So how is that a critique of worker owned businesses specifically?

It's not.  It is an answer to the narrow question about why workers would not be motivated to sacrifice for the long-term health of their business.  It is indeed equally applicable to many capitalist businesses -- but not all of them.  For example, entrepreneurs necessarily take risks and make sacrifices for the long-term success of the businesses they start.

The modern capitalist/socialist hybrid is the most successful economic model in all of history.  There is no reason to believe that pure communism is feasible at all, much less more effective, at a national level.

ESOPS are widely available even in pure capitalism.  There is nothing to stop employees from purchasing an interest in their own company.  But in the capitalist model, we also see that most minority shareholders are ill-informed, unqualified and/or apathetic.  Why would a collective be any different?

Mondragon is an outlier which proves nothing about a national economy.  As noted in my original comment, the cooperatives that do work only function because they do not have to keep the slackers, and because those who want more (or different) rewards can go elsewhere, into the larger economy.

I likewise have no problem with a manager who is elected -- so long as the electorate (the workers) will take the time to be sure they are electing the most qualified ... oh, wait."

I think Star Wars: The Old Republic MMO has a good medium zone. Some armor is tastefully sexy -- skin-tight pants and a top that shows the belly, for example -- and some is more modest -- like good ol' Jedi robes. Fable 2 did well, too -- offering the modest noble woman's dresses alongside the ""hot date"" outfit. I think that's what we need.

Also I think women who don't acknowledge the fact that nudity and being in control of your own sexuality can be part of feminism too are just prudes. There's a difference between having naked women to play as just eye-candy for men and having naked women because they're empowered and in control of their sexuality and aren't ashamed of their bodies.

These transistors turn things on and off, (like ""There's no signal, so don't let anything through - it's just static) and microcontrollers are the exact same thing on a larger scale.

It's actually not that hard. The big thing is that unlike higher-level programming languages, you have to specify every single step. Once you realize how tasks get broken down, it becomes a little easier.

Most stuff with microcontrollers is this:

1. Is Position 1 on or off?
2. If it's on, turn off Position 8 and turn on Position 7.
3. If it's off, turn off Position 7 and turn on Position 8.
4. Is Position 2 on or off?

And so on. Your microcontroller is just taking input from the input positions and then turning stuff on or off in accordance with that input. And it does this in a loop many, many times per second.

It ends up being simple as long as you're thorough and meticulous.

So what? Definitions of words are quite frequently different from the etymology, that's just how language works. Words change, definitions change, it's a thing. I really like exploring the etymology of words, but seriously, the etymology does *not* tell us what a word ""really"" means. As such, your initial premise is seriously flawed. 

&gt; it‚Äôs rather silly to condone the bastardization of language in legal documentation.

I'm really not sure what to make of the fact that you are describing the totally normal process of changing language as ""bastardization."" Regardless, why is it silly to not allow legal documents to change along with the rest of the language? Should legal documents all be written in old english, since modern english is so ""bastardized"" compared to that? Of course not. Legal definitions change too, there's nothing wrong with that.

EmergencyTaco,reactiongifs,1390776105.0,"We don't view women as numbers, but we use numbers as an easy method of conveying a woman's level of physical attractiveness to other men.  

Let me try to draw a parallel, although it's hard to explain. Say you had a male friend who was black. If you were talking about this friend to someone else and they asked you what color his skin was, (for whatever reason, let's just say you're talking about having your friend potentially audition for a specific role in a play about the 1950's Civil Rights movement, it doesn't matter), you would say he's black to quickly convey information. You're not making any comment on the person's personality, self worth, value or anything else besides the aesthetics of their person. You could say they're dark skinned, brown skinned, not white, not hispanic or whatever, but just saying ""black"" is the quickest way to convey information and you know the person will understand what you're saying. 

While this isn't the best comparison I think you get what I mean. In this instance OP is talking about introducing a woman to his friend in a romantic sense, and his friend turning the offer down for what many would consider a silly reason. In order to help convey the woman's level of attractiveness he offered a number on an unofficial scale that is understood by pretty much everyone. While it's a very simplistic and primitive method of describing a human being, it conveys the information effectively. You understood that he meant a very attractive female, not a supermodel or just drop-dead gorgeous, but still extremely attractive. Just saying ""8"" is easier, quicker and just as effective as saying ""she's incredibly pretty, she's not a supermodel and there are other girls prettier, but she's definitely in the top 20% women in terms of physical attractiveness."" OP wanted to convey that his friend didn't even give the girl a chance, and it had nothing to do with her not being attractive enough.

Say what you want, but when searching for a SO a level of physical attractiveness matters to many people, and therefore OP had every reason to make a comment about this girl's attractiveness level when describing her. It is by no means the most important thing when searching for a partner, but it isn't negligible either. Referring to a girl as a number on a scale is no more offensive or objectifying than calling a person ""hot"" ""pretty"" ""gorgeous"" ""attractive"" or any other adjective you can think of.  

**TL;DR: Think of numbers on the scale as synonyms for words like ""gorgeous,"" ""hot,"" ""pretty,"" ""attractive,"" ""ugly,"" ""unattractive,"" etc. It is a quick method of conveying someone's PHYSICAL characteristics in a way that pretty much everyone understands. It is by no means a comment on any other aspect of a person. If you're not offended by someone being referred to as a ""gorgeous girl"" then you shouldn't be offended by someone being referred to as an 8, 9, 10, 2, 5 or whatever.**"

Not accurate. Faith is a belief that is not based on proof ([source](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith?s=t)) My view that the sun came before life is based on proof. 

&gt; There no way getting around the fact the Bible says the Sun came afterwards. It's not metaphorical in your eyes, it's false.

I could type a whole essay, but instead I'll advise you to look up William Lane Craig. He can explain much better than I can why your ""If not X, then Y"" statement is false. He's a very popular apologist who has effectively argued that Genesis 1 is not a text supposed to be taken literally. Just use literary analysis.

&gt; If I have to believe something, and maybe be wrong about it one day, I'm always gonna err on the side of an all powerful Creator who doesn't lie.

Appeal to Authority logical fallacy.

&gt; I really did want to hear you reasoning when I first put the argument to you. I was disappointed.

You don't need to hear my reasoning. If you really want answers, you can look up online various scientific articles that will provide you evidence on why your current worldview is wrong. You could also check out theological resources that will indicate why your view on Genesis 1 is also wrong. If for some reason you don't want to read online, visit your local library. Please just don't look for random people's reasoning, actually do research its much more beneficial and saves everyone time. "

I've tried mixing those two before and really liked it so I'm guessing that would work as well. Sometimes people can break out from some oils, but I think the ones that are least likely to irritate you are hemp, safflower, and sunflower. I've also tried olive oil (would not recommend, makes your vision super blurry and breaks some people out), avocado oil, grapeseed oil, mineral oil, etc. so feel free to ask me any more questions about this if you're interested!

Otherwise, I actually double cleanse so I remove my makeup with oil and then wash with a gel facial wash with salicylic acid + water.

2. A tendency to devalue or ignore tasks outside our expertise.
3. The efficiencies of specialization.
4. Those with genuine ambition are outnumbered by those who just want security.
5. The tendency to choose short-term comfort over the sacrifices needed for long-term success.
6. The relative rarity of good managerial skills, as well as the difficulties of identifying them.

I'm not going to convince you that your dream is a fantasy.  You likely disagree with one, some or all of this list.

3. Go do it. Go slowly and with enough weight that it hurts, but keep good form. Form is much, much more important than getting another ten pounds on the bar.

4. Figure out what you like and don't like. Just doing it makes you get a good sense of what's good and bad. For example, I don't do skullcrushers because my elbow hurts really badly when I do it.

Your SAT scores are not up-to-par

Weighted GPA, does not matter much here.  It's all about the unweighted. the mid 50% GPA is 3.85 - 4.11. 

Top ten percent of your class also doesn't mean much. If I took my GPA from high school as top 25% and went to a school with a class of lower standard, I could have been validictorian maybe. Point, being that this is too subjective. At my old high school, the difference between 1st and 15th was about 0.04, the highest being within tenths of a 4.0.

As of right now, we have a LOT of marriage law and court precedents and the like. We can't just switch to civil unions, at least, not without a whole lot of trouble. In fact, there have been cases where marriage laws were determined to not apply to civil unions. So basically, we'd have to go over ALL the old marriage laws and change ALL of it to apply to civil unions, or just throw it out and start over. 

Legally speaking, simply deciding that same sex unions are also marriages is much more straight forward and simple. "

racistsfuckoff,socialism,1390778092.0,"The second definition of capitalism listed in that link is not technically correct, and fudging this definition can lead to confusion. Political clarity, and an accurate assessment/understanding of the world is paramount.

Example, Bill Gates is a capitalist. Let's make up some small-time politician at a local or state level - Susan Jones. Susan Jones does not own the means of production. She's a lawyer who joined the conservative party, and is a servant of the capitalist class. She advocates capitalism, and promotes the interests of Bill Gates. With the definition you're using, she is also a capitalist. However Bill and Susan clearly occupy very different positions in society, and it's important we have a proper analysis of each of them. Using the term ""capitalist"" for both of them doesn't necessarily preclude having the correct understanding of their different positions, but it muddies the issue, particularly for new people, or people you might be trying to convince. 

I don't mean to be obtuse toward what you're saying. I found it clear what you meant by your comment. Other people might not find it clear what you mean, and in certain circumstances important things might be misunderstood by yourself and others due to an incorrect understanding."

No your humor isn't entirely different. In fact, what you just described is exactly what American humor is often accused of being (every reddit thread on American vs British humor always says thats what American humor is). Watch our sitcoms, many of them feature humor based around sarcastic and quick one liners. Sarcasm and one liners is huge part of American humor.

We can spend all day claiming the differences between American and British humor, but what we'd up end doing is describing things the other person identifies with as ""their humor"".

The posts they're referring to aren't humor or banter, its just declarative, sweeping low effort comments with opinions that are easy to digest and agree with. Its not a different style of humor, its lazy and frequently makes inaccurate or hyperbolic claims. 

&gt; so what you perceive a funny won't be to us and vice versa.
Also, not true. Humor is humor and we're not that different. The difference is you find something far funnier if you agree with it and/or its sentiment. If its a joke about the US-ENG game, Englishmen are far less likely to find it funny whereas Americans are far less funny to find comments that Jozy is totally shit, funny."

Because of this, the few good players that come out of small countries like these are often left out of international competitions (ie George Best, Ryan Giggs) or decide to play for the larger nation (ie Clarence Seedorf, born in Suriname, played for the Netherlands). 

In regards to the Spanish provinces, it probably wasn't the best example but they are historical countries within the Kingdom of Spain which currently have many privileges that almost allow them to act as sovereign states and they too have been pushing the issue of being allowed to play as separate nations, although I do not feel they should."

CloneOutcast,todayilearned,1390778467.0,"I don't think people understand just how crushing it was for him. Not only did he have to act on a green screen with no other actors but all the actors were literally one set over, acting, laughing, etc. Not only was he alone on the set but he was also isolated from the other actors and crew.

He was viewed through a monitor while Jackson and the rest were at the 2/3rds set making sure things went well there. All the while, Ian McKellen was looking at lightbulbs with the other actors' faces on them.

The reason he ended up crying was because the take went completely well except for something that he did wrong. He was literally ""to blame"" for the take going poorly. He was upset and started to cry all the while he still had a microphone attached to his costume and the crew could hear him.

There is actually a part in the BTS features of *An Unexpected Journey* where you can see all of this happening and it is absolutely heartbreaking. He felt unappreciated and was willing to quit the production entirely. I think he mentioned that this would be the reason why he would retire.

To make it up to him the crew decorated his tent quarters and had an ""Appreciate Gandalf"" day."

Natla,AskWomen,1390778699.0,"I don't think I am allergic but definitely sensitive to makeup. My EYES! It makes them hurt so much and my eyes are already really sensitive. Using eye make remover sucks so much because I'm rubbing my eyes and it just makes the irritation worse. I found this mascara that comes off in flakes by just using hot water. So usually when I wear makeup, I wear that mascara and then my foundation and blush (which don't bug my skin too much). I then use a face wash to take off the foundation and blush and use lots of moisturizer afterwards and my skin is normally OK. When I use eyeshadow though and have to use real eye makeup over, it usually makes my eye lids puffy and hurt for a day afterwards. If you are wondering what kind of mascara I use it is called Clinique Lash Power Mascara Long-Wearing. 

For my foundation I use Bareminerals original foundation and my blush I love is the Tarte powder blushes.

Generosity is so good because we expect nothing in return when we do something kind for someone. People don't realize you should do something to benefit others, not so you can be glorified for doing what people would consider a ""selfless act."" Generosity is good because you [can spread the](knowledgehttp://planetsave.com/2013/12/16/homeless-man-learns-code-creates-carpooling-app/) you to someone who you found on the street or to someone from another country. The best part about spreading your knowledge is that they are learning to fish and not just receiving fish. I don't know why people would say they are doing something out of the kindness of their heart when they go and tell everyone that they did something for a dying man or helped a poor man.
Generosity is something that people, people who take time out of their lives just to help a stranger they may never meet again. Why? That's what I'd ask my dad whenever he talked to me about being generous, Why would I help someone with no reward for me? Now that I'm older i understand why he always told me not to expect a reward...People that you help out usually have nothing to give to you except a thank you. [This man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsIOoXG_gmo) had nothing to give back to Vitaly, but he still helped him. People like Mother Theresa, or Gandhi, and MLK Jr. did these things for other people, such as fighting for their freedom or giving fresh food and water to third world countries. What did any of these people get in return...jailtime, being bashed by newspapers and magazines why...all they did was try to help people, they did not put anyone lives in danger or steal from others for their gain.

These first four are unarguably the most influential sci-fi anime series ever produced. If you can't handle ""older animation"", Yamato and Eva have had recent remakes/re-imaginings. You're shit-out-of-luck when it comes to Gundam and Macross, though. Course, if you have a hard time with older animation, you're gonna have a bad time with the rest of this list.

**Aim for the Top!! Gunbuster** -- As Hard Sci-fi as a super robot show will ever be. With the exception of the titular mech, the rest are ""real"" robots. Worth a watch if you are a fan of sci-fi, Studio Gainax, the eighties, or parodies of shoujo tennis anime.

**Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise** -- Story of the first manned space flight in an alternate universe. Pay close attention to the ""technology"": stuff like money, eating utensils, that sort of thing.

**Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou** -- Slice-of-Life set in the post apocalyptic Japanese countryside. Follows a cafe-owning robot and the people she meets. Anime only adapts 18 chapters of a 140 chapter manga."

Amicron,DnD,1390779487.0,"Alright, let's do this. 

**Point 1: Hitpoints**

[From the SRD:](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#theDruidsAnimalCompanion)

&gt; *Bonus HD*

&gt; Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal.

This means that as your companion increases in level, it gains more hitdice, but at a slightly slower rate than you do. When you are level 1-2, it has the base 2d8+4 hitpoints. As soon as you hit level 3, however, it gains two more hit dice, as well as twice its constitution modifier. Effectively what this means is that for every three hit dice you gain, it gains two.

Here's a table-ish thing to show you what your companion's total health is at the relevant levels:

* Level 1: 2d8+4

* Level 3: 4d8+8

* Level 6: 6d8+12

* Level 9: 8d8+16

* Level 12: 10d8+20

* Level 15: 12d8+24

* Level 18: 14d8+28

**Point 2: Feats**

An animal companion can take any feat that it qualifies for. For example, it could take [Spell Focus:](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#spellFocus) Necromancy, but it would be less than useless for a riding dog. A more practical choice would be something like [Improved Initiative](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#improvedInitiative) or [Weapon Focus:](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#weaponFocus) Bite.

**Point 3: Skill Points**

An animal companion gains skill points just like you do. At first level, it will gain [2+(-4)]x4 skill points, with [2+(-4)] skill points per hitdie after that. Keep in mind that, like hitpoints, no matter what the creature's Intelligence modifier is, they always receive at least one skill point per hitdie.  So at level 3, your animal companion will have 2 additional skill points to add to those already listed in the [description for a Riding Dog.](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/dogRiding.htm)

Every time it gains hitdice after that, it gains another 2 skill points that it can add to any of the listed skills, or that it can use to buy 1 rank in a cross-class skill (For animals, any unlisted skill is cross-class).

**Point 4: Base Attack Bonus**

Your animal companion's BAB will be the equal to 3/4 its hitdice (Base plus bonus hitdice, rounded down). So at Druid level 3, your companion will have 4 hitdice, and therefore a BAB of +3.

**Point 5: Saving Throws**

I know you didn't actually ask about this, but I think it's worth mentioning. Animals have good Reflex and Fortitude saving throws, and poor Will saves. This means that your companion's base saving throws will be the same as those of an equal-level [Ranger](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm).

I hope that helps. I could probably write up a Level-by-level table for its various attributes, if desired."

wdn,changemyview,1390779495.0,"The english language changes. If a word hasn't had a transformation like this in it's meaning, it's probably just because it's not old enough yet. Queer means strange or abnormal, and that's why it first got applied to homosexuals, but now if you'll look in the dictionary you'll find that these days it also means homosexual. And it's rarely used to mean strange or abnormal anymore. I suspect that it will stop being used for that altogether.

""Gay"" also used to be a derogatory term for homosexuals. You seem comfortable using that one. I think the only difference is that the time when the meaning started to change is farther in the past for gay than for queer.

But the main thing is this: The primary rule of names is that you call people what they want to be called and don't call them what they don't want to be called. Any other rules or etiquette or reasoning like you've given here is only for figuring out what that might be when you haven't had the opportunity to ask them directly yet. An outsider who wants to tell them what names they must or must not accept is in for a very rough ride."

AlfredHawthorneHill,AskReddit,1390779627.0,"By analogy, imagine a football game in which the kicker, lining up to kick a (game-winning) field goal, notices a guy on the other team who, over the course of the season, had made a few bad plays that had lost games for his team.  Rather than kicking to score points (and win), the kicker aims to kick the ball to that other player so that this guy on ~~another~~ an *opposing* team (*viz.*, a team trying to win the game just like the kicker's own teammates are trying to win) feels better about himself even though the kicker's team loses as a result of him throwing a game.  The notion that the kicker's teammates should have performed well enough not to rely on the kicker to win for them is bullshit:  a team plays *as a team* and counts on teammates stepping up to play their respective roles.  It sounds worse than dubious for the kicker to say to himself, ""Fuck it, my moral 'superiority' excuses me from my duty to my teammates to play for ~~their~~ our collective goals, thus I actually have a free pass to shank a kick *on purpose* and undermine ~~their~~ our commitment to play as a team towards a common goal.""

The autistic kid was good enough to make the team and tournament, so his school and coach treated him as a big enough boy to assume the responsibility to play his matches according to his demonstrated abilities.  The autistic kid's school and coach thus respected his dignity more by letting him play with the possibility of losing than OP granted him by throwing a game and letting him enjoy a thoroughly undeserved sense of accomplishment.  You think the autistic boy was the only player (autistic or not) to go 0-4 in a chess tournament?  There are teams of sports of all stripes that have lost 20 consecutive games or more - yet would you expect *anyone* on *any* of those teams to take you up on the offer to ""win"" a game he knew the other team had thrown out of pity?

msbubbles326,weddingplanning,1390779702.0,"We didn't have a traditional rehearsal dinner, but we did have a rehearsal. I had never been in a wedding so I was completely clueless, and a couple members of the wedding party were in the same boat. the rehearsal itself was very short and was included in our venue. I think it took 20, maybe 30 minutes. After that, in lieu of a fancy dinner, we went down the street to a local brewery. We did have a couple family members who picked up the tab, which was very kind, but our guests that night had already planned on paying their own way and were totally fine with it. Having the tab paid was a very lovely and unexpected surprise for us. 

We invited the wedding party, any SOs of theirs, parents, and grandparents. We had a total of sixteen people. It was really nice to just hang out, have some drinks, and relax with friends and family. My husband and I decided that we just could not see each other after midnight, so we kissed goodnight at 11:59pm and went to our separate rooms at the hotel.

Weddings are expensive, and everyone knows this, so I think now a days it is not uncommon to be asked to pay for things like your dinner at a rehearsal dinner. I would just be mindful of the restaurant you choose so everyone can afford it. You don't have to do dinner, you can make it whatever you want, or skip it altogether. I personally think the rehearsal itself is important though, just so everyone is on the same page the day of and everything can go as smoothly as possible."

As for advice, I would start with defining your brows. You can go and get them professionally shaped if you like, and then afterwards just maintain the shape yourself by plucking. Alternatively, you can do it yourself with the help of some tutorials out there (here is one on [shaping/tweezing the brow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK1LfRjCkEY)). Just be careful not to over pluck! I can see you have nice natural brows at the moment which are easier to work with than super thin hairs.

Next step is filling in the brows as they are quite light; here is another [tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeqvBqJ1zQU) that might help (this one goes through several styles, you don't have to do all of them, just the style you like). Pick a product shade that is slightly darker than your hair colour.

I can't tell if you're wearing mascara in all your pictures, but if you find your lashes aren't getting enough curl, I would recommend using an eyelash curler first before applying mascara. That would really open your eyes up.

For lip colour, I think the red looks nice on you! If you're after a more natural shade, the Revlon Lip Butters / Maybelline Color Whispers which are semi-sheer (like a cross between lipstick and lip balm) have a good range that can work as a natural colour on you. Google will show you plenty of colour swatches -- I'd suggest Creme Brulee, Berry Smoothie, Peach Parfait (has shimmer) or Pink Truffle out of Revlon, or Rose of Attraction and Made it Mauve out of Maybelline.

Lastly, I think contouring would also be great on you, although it can be trickier to get right. If you feel up to it, there are plenty of tutorials on youtube to help, and you can always come back to ask more questions after trying it out."

I own that hood. The Jackson nexgen EQC. Had it for about 8 or 9 years. I've used it as a professional welder fabricator for the duration. I am not behind my mask for 8 hrs a day as my tasks include all aspects of building and fabricating products. 
3n1 hoods are good but don't expect to use the ""grind"" setting for anything they requires attention to detail, a clear face shield is a better choice. 
In 9 years I have replaced the headgear twice, the batteries about twice a year, a lens mounting clip, and countless lens covers. The broken lens mounting clip allowed my lens to fly out and land on the concrete shop floor, cracking open the plastic body, but the glass stayed in tact. Carefully put it back together insuring the circuit boards were properly located, a bit of duct tape and she still works every day like a charm. I love it and would recommend it to anybody.

I also own the harbor freight auto darkening hood that I bought when I forgot my hood for a weekend side job. I kept it as a backup and for the 45 bucks or whatever it's not bad. Esp. For a backup. I was trying to simply buy a fixed lens hood, or a standard lens for my old hood Jackson fixed lens...  But now I have 3 welding helmets! Haha.

Improper burden-shifting.  What *motivates* or *incentivizes* workers to act like entrepreneurs when there are no additional rewards for their greater work and sacrifice?

&gt;Although I wouldn't call todays society at all socialist. Why do you?

I am not aware of any society which is purely capitalist.  Even the US has a social safety-net of sorts, including the ACA.  There are socialist elements in every society I can think of.

&gt;I don't see what you're saying here to be honest. I was giving an example of a more worker controlled organization of business and showing that it doesn't just automatically fail.

I am saying it has yet to be established that ESOPS actually result in more worker control.

&gt;It's actually the 11th largest corporation in Spain if I am not mistaken. So definitely not an ""outlier.""

I'm not sure you understood what I mean by ""outlier.""  What other large corporations can you think of that are run collectively?  If Mondragon is the only one, then it is indeed an ""outlier,"" regardless of its size.  Even if there are four or five others, what percentage is that of all corporations at least as large?  Too tiny to be statistically significant.

&gt;The reason Mondragon is successful is because of its worker oriented style. The workers feel involved and therefore work harder and more efficiently.

That's your belief, yes.  And I'm sure that's in Mondragon's PR as well.  That does not make it so.

&gt;So what makes sure a manager is so qualified today in a capitalist business?

There are never any guarantees.  Many fail and have to be replaced.  Many succeed until they reach their ""level of incompetence.""

Problem is, being selected by the workers incentivizes the manager to make decisions that will be popular with the workers, rather than good for the enterprise's long-term efficiency.  This is not an insurmountable problem, but it is a problem that would have to be addressed.  How does Mondragon select its managers?"

dreamingofjellyfish,explainlikeimfive,1390780450.0,"Usually one generation of inbreeding won't cause major problems, unless the parents share a very harmful recessive gene and both pass it to their offspring. But many generations of inbreeding will tend to cause problems. 

You can think of it kind of like breeding a purebred dog - for example pugs are bred for a very flattened nose and this can cause problems with their breathing, skin folds, and eyes. In human the selection for harmful traits isn't intentional, but they still accumulate with multiple generations of inbreeding because the odds of passing on those traits becomes higher when both parents have it. Then repeat that phenomenon through multiple pairings and generations to get severe results of inbreeding.

A really classic example is [Charles II of Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain). He came from about 6-7 generations of purposeful inbreeding and had very poor health, was mentally disabled, and died before his 40th birthday.

Well not easily, and as a practical matter trying to have private distribution and point of sale billing isn't a great  plan except for things like steel manufacturing or other big industrial facilities.  There are a lot of benefits to large centralized generating stations with a single redundant and fault tolerant grid, and there's no real reason for private distributors, if anything they are bad for the process.  

If costs shift enough that it becomes economical for everyone to put a windmill and solar panels on their roof then things will change a lot.  But so long as it is preferable to generate electric power from big power stations and then send it everywhere we're not likely to see much useful change. 



&gt; I suppose the proper term would be electricity, wouldn't it?

Depends who you are talking to.  You are in particular talking about electricity generation (or electric power generation) but there are other types of power - mechanical, steam etc. so particularly if you want to  include industrial power applications it becomes a bit more complex, as you can replace one type of power with another.

tangonovember,TwoXChromosomes,1390780622.0,"My father was an incredibly good haggler (over basically anything, but especially cars). I'm not nearly as good, but I've successfully haggled on both a car purchased and on getting a bonus when I got my most recent job.

I'm not sure if you've purchased a car before, but here's how it will probably go. You'll show up and find the person who will take you on the test drive. You'll drive around for a few miles (make sure to really test the car, especially if it's a used one. I'm not a car expert, so I can't give you everything to try, but don't just go for a casual spin - test the braking, the acceleration, all of the controls, etc.)

Once the test drive is over, you'll be back at the dealership and will go into one of those small rooms. The dealer might have some documentation ready to sign right then, but more likely they'll expect haggling and will just start with the listed price. Here's where you'll give a counter-offer, and things progress from there.

Generally, the dealer will try to act like he's on your side, and is negotiating WITH you against 'his boss' or some other invisible third party. I'm not a car dealer, so I don't know if this is actually true, but I suspect it's not. Don't allow the dealer to 'friend' you and make you feel like you're hurting him or his business by negotiating - this is a fully expected and normal part of car buying.

Here are some general tips about the actual negotiation:

* Negotiation is all about leverage. It helps you if the car (or type of car) you're looking for is readily available from multiple local dealers, and if you don't need the car immediately. This all makes it more likely that you'll walk away unless you get the deal you're looking for, and that the dealer probably has fewer people asking about that car. I know you've been drooling over this car for a long time, but try not to make that too apparent when speaking with the dealer. Again, you want to at least give the appearance that you're quite willing to walk away if you don't get the deal you want.

* Get a target price in your head - something that you promise yourself is the max you'll pay, and hold yourself to walking away if you don't get that price. This is not the price you start at - it's just the highest you'll go. Base this price off of data from sites like KBB.com, edwards.com and other car resource sites which can tell you what a fair value for that sort of car might be.

* Never counter your own offer. A typical trick (especially if the other party senses that you're not as willful) is to act surprised or taken aback by your offer, and then say that it's out of the question or that you need to come up. Don't do this - ask him for a counter offer. The more you move your own offer without him having to counter, the less countering he actually has to do.

* Don't be afraid of standing your ground. I'm at the age where my friends (especially those coming out of advanced degrees) are getting their first 'career' jobs, and I find a lot (and, to be honest, especially women) don't feel comfortable holding their ground in a negotiation, and will cave if they sense disapproval or resistance on the other side. Especially in today's economy and job market, many say they're just 'happy to have an offer.' Applying this back to your car buying - be prepared to sit and wait for a while in a negotiation, and try not to cave if it's dragging on for a while.

A final trick to be aware of - dealers often like to talk about how far they've ""come down"" in price towards your own offer. This is absolutely meaningless, and don't be afraid to point it out - they set their own offer, after all. It doesn't impact what you feel is a fair price for the car.

Also, one more important note - negotiating doesn't have to be rude or confrontational! Be calm, polite and reasoned with your points - but be firm. You're not having an argument, you're discussing a fair price for an asset. Even if you end up walking away, be sure to thank the dealer for their time and to give you a call if they would like to discuss this any further.

By making most stories about only white guys of that age range, that means you aren't hearing stories about women or people of color.

Why do we have women's studies courses or African American studies courses? Because people in academia realized that conventional education about literature/history/etc was all from the perspective of white men.

Also, as a member of academia, I'd like to point out that there was actually nothing wrong with anything Anita Sarkeesian did. The only thing she did wrong was criticize video games for not portraying women very well. People disagreed with her *before* watching her videos, then perceived her as snarky or said she was cherry-picking data to justify their preformed conclusions.

That's the reality about discussing gender in our culture. You're going to be called names. You're going to be called wrong. Period. There's nothing you can do to stop it. So don't worry about that. Worry about getting it right, and believing what you're doing is important, and keep doing it. There are people whose minds you will never change. But that doesn't matter. What does matter is that you keep trying to change the minds of people in general.

Willravel,DaystromInstitute,1390781032.0,"&gt;It's origin. The movie presents it's own theory and is factually definitive to a point (when Voyager 6 falls into the 'black hole'), but it leaves many things to the imagination. Who were the 'living machines?' If they were so powerful (Spock: 'unbelievable technology'), then what were they doing sitting around on a single planet?

It's almost certainly a synthetic civilization left behind by a biological civilization that created AI. I know this is expanded on in novels, but it does stand to reason even without them that the Machines, as Spock calls them, are like the Geth from Mass Effect or the Replicators from Stargate or the Machines from The Matrix, in that they're what remained after their biological makers were either destroyed or moved on. Hopefully it was the latter. 

What's interesting is how V'Ger doesn't understand the concept of intelligent machines having been created by biological entities. Could it be he inherited this understanding from the Machines? Maybe they're so far removed from their creators that they've lost the knowledge that they didn't come about as a normal part of evolution. That'd suggest their creators have not been around for a very, very long time. Perhaps they're the creation of the Humanoid Progenitors, who seeded space with the potential for intelligent humanoid life? Perhaps they're the creation of the Q in a much earlier stage of existence? Perhaps the same civilization that constructed the Dyson Sphere? It would be interesting if their creators intentionally removed their origin from the Machines' memories. 

I suspect Voyager came upon one Machine planet of many. As you allude to, it makes no sense for a civilization that values survival to stay in one place, even if they are powerful. 

&gt;How is V'Ger powered? In far interstellar space, its cloud diameter exceeded 82 Astronomical Units (1 AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun), which itself is many times larger than the Sun. It would be an unimaginably huge consumer of energy.

Best guess is it's several major advancements beyond matter/anti-matter channeled via dilithium. The Romulans utilize artificial singularities, Gomtuu utilized some kind of organic power source. It could be anything, but no matter what it is, it's friggin' big. If I had to guess, V'Ger runs on a star. As you say, it's massive, and what are massive sources of power we can find in the universe? Stars. It's possible that, as V'Ger grew, with the advanced Machine technology, it plucked a star from somewhere and started utilizing it for powering systems and propulsion. Kinda crazy to think about. 

&gt;Why is V'Ger itself so advanced and huge? If it were truely only ~350 years old, it must have grown at a phenomenal rate to achieve its size.

The dust is probably just from moving through space and begin big enough to have a massive gravitational influence. It's possible that the Machine technology didn't necessarily develop in a way that required miniaturization, as the Machines aren't necessarily 2 meters tall like we are. It could be that necessary computational power to achieve sentience like V'Ger requires a lot of space. It's also possible that the Machine planet is a Machine planet, meaning it's an individual of the Machine race, and there are many planets which are all individuals. They could have made V'Ger into a world, like them, and sent it on its merry way. 

&gt;How can Spock sense V'Ger at such a massive distance while the other Vulcans can't?

Perhaps there's some element of his human side which allows him to sense the specific kind of brainwaves V'Ger has. Half Vulcan/half humans are still quite rare in Spock's time. 

&gt;What is it with V'Ger's internal structure ? When using his rocket pack to pass the cyclic orifice, Spock enters the 'imaging chamber' of V'Ger. Yet a short time later, V'Ger spits him back out at the Enterprise, and after they negotiate with the Ilia probe, they're pulled through the very same opening and into the chamber containing the original probe. Huh?

I've always suspected that V'Ger is a repurposed moon or planet. The Machines take resource-rich bodies in space and change them into giant ships capable of carrying their personalities. 

&gt;How can V'Ger be so huge and yet not affect the gravity of any planets in the solar system?

That's a good question. It could be that V'Ger's power output and technology is so high that it can essentially create a gravitational dampening field around itself so as to avoid causing significant changes to nearby systems. Remember when Q recommended Geordi change the gravitation constant of the universe? That kind of thinking starts to become practical at a sufficiently advanced level of technology. 

&gt;What might have happened to V'Ger at the end of the movie?

This is one of my favorite questions in all of Star Trek, and one I think about from time to time. I like to think that Voyager combined with Decker, achieving it's goal to impart all the knowledge it had collected to its creator, man. After this, however, it realized the mission wasn't simply about collecting data and returning it, the mission was the same mission we saw in TOS, and TNG, and Enterprise, for humanity to go forth into the cosmos to grow as it learned, to develop deeper and better perspectives, to value knowledge and share it for the betterment of all. I can see V'Ger, now as a higher being, making contact with civilizations far more advanced than we can possibly imagine, acting as ambassador for humanity, which will be following V'Ger in time. "

You're suffering the small-FC problem; you're acting like a training camp. When folks are strong enough they graduate and swim upstream to larger venues with more opportunities. It's very natural.

Your responses to this are to recruit more people and actually start doing the content the end-game players want... or consider merging into a larger FC so that your current people have more opportunity. Alternately, stay small and run things the way you've been running them, while accepting that people will be moving on as opportunity requires.

&gt; As mentioned, the safest spinal posture is a neutral position, with no incidents of flexion or hyperextension in any segments. However, studies show that powerlifters flex their spines considerably, but they avoid injury simply because they avoid end-ranges of lumbar flexion.

&gt; Furthermore, if you examine where most of the rounding occurs in powerlifters, a vast majority takes place in the upper back (the thoracic spine), and this strategy is safer compared to the other way around (mostly lumbar rounding).

&gt; If you choose to go ahead with rounded-back deadlifting, make sure that your lumbar spine doesn't approach end-range flexion.

Now, that said, my parents' relationship will not be true of all people. If both people of the couple are very religious, or very faithful to their denomination, it can cause problems. My mother is less religious than my father, though she's still Christian and still believes philosophically in many Presbyterian beliefs, and my father is very ecumenical in many ways. This won't be true for all people. In those cases, a break-up may be inevitable. It's worth thinking about, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions either way."

ChrisVolkoff,OkCupid,1390782259.0,"I just wanted to comment (even if I'm a bit late) because this looks a lot like my own life.

&gt; It was like I was alive, but as soon as I met her I REALLY started to live. For the first time ever, I was truly happy.

I was never really happy, just ""okay,"" but when I met this girl last year.. I finally started to live, to enjoy life. I could use this paragraph to describe the end of our relationship:

&gt; Unfortunately, that happiness that she brought soon faded... and it left behind a feeling of devastation. She came so, soooo close and then she receded back into some dark corner and I just couldn't reach out to her. In that corner she fucked up a major, major part of her life. That fuck-up was easily avoidable, if only she'd reached out and grabbed my hand, because I'd been in similar situations and knew what to do. But she didn't, she neither rejected nor accepted me; she was just silent, despite talking to me, if that makes sense.

And then this:

&gt; I'm not feeling down because I'm not demanding much from myself. I'm down because someone who I see I love is stuck in a viscous cycle that's going to break her, psychologically speaking, and I can't do a thing to stop it - I've tried, but it didn't work. That's what's been making me not expect much from myself for the last few weeks. I want to know how you can let go of someone who you love but has rejected you and how to let them destroy themselves.

This all ended in June, but it dragged on for a few months. Last time I talked to her was in December. I feel like she's destroying herself. I really want to help her, but I know I can't. I really can't. At least not until she reaches out to me for help.

What can we do, though? How can we let go? Some people say that time helps.. But it doesn't guarantee anything.

I'm 19 (and an engineering student!). I decided that I would take time for myself to get back on my feet. We're at (slightly) different points of our lives, but it doesn't matter. Of course, I often think about her, but that doesn't stop me from making progress.

Dating isn't really in my plans for now, but who knows what could happen.

I hope I will, some day, wake up and realize that I'm *okay*.

James_GAF,cordcutters,1390783016.0,"Almost all of your stations are UHF with some VHF hi. You've got quite a lot of options to try things out. If you've got materials lying around there are DIY plans for bow antennas. http://redd.it/hnwm2 Trying that out inside by a window with a good sight line toward the channels to see what kind of reception you get can give you an idea of what is possible.

There are compass apps for android and iphone that can help you aim toward the signals concentrated around 157deg at ~34 miles. I don't know how the DIY would work out for you, but if you've got the stuff it's worth a try.

If the DIY doesn't cut it you can try something like this inside [Bow Tie](http://www.solidsignal.com/pview.asp?mc=03&amp;p=U4000&amp;d=Antennacraft-by-RadioShack-U4000-UHFHD-4-Bay-Bowtie-TV-Antenna-(U4000) might improve things. That could be mounted outside if it's not cutting it indoors.

Then there is something like this: http://www.solidsignal.com/pview.asp?mc=03&amp;p=HBU22&amp;d=Antennacraft-by-RadioShack-HBU22-22-Element-HighBand-VHF-UHF-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-(HBU22)&amp;c=TV%20Antennas&amp;sku=1607900201

Outside has the highest potential, but in your attic space may work out well. A cable will need to run from the antenna inside. If attic mounting works try to find another cable run into the attic and borrow it's path into the house. Though depending on how your house is setup it may be better to drill and seal the penetration as best you can. It's really hard to say since every house is different and your best solution will be somewhat unique.

You have the option to choose where to spend your money, and if you can support either of two fast food chains and one is Chipotle who preaches a lot of crap about free range animals and local vegetables, whereas the other is chik-fil-a, it's easy to support the more ethical company and feel good about it.

TheBlackDahliaMurder,Fitness,1390783473.0,"Even though I'm that bent over, the weight is still on my heels. That was never an issue for me. You have to squat in a way that allows you to keep your torso somewhat upright. So I plan on widening my stance, turning my feet out even further away from straight forward, and really driving my knees out. This will essentially shorten my femur and I'll be able to stay more upright while keeping the bar over my center of gravity. 

Everyone's squat will look different depending on their own body proportions and preference. Anyone who tells you a squat must look a certain way is wrong. There are only a few things that are definitely required for a good squat. Those are a tight upper back, arched lower back, weight on the heels, bar over the center of gravity, hitting parallel and not letting your knees cave in. Things like stance, how turned out your feet are, head position, etc. are all personal to you.

As for your knees caving in, focus on opening your hips and pushing your knees out."

They end up creamier than regular boiling, and seem easier to peel.

They do stink up your cooker though, so make sure you clean it really well afterwards.

Pit_Sweat,seduction,1390783559.0,"More details would help but it sounds like you are charging head first into a last-minute resistance and then giving up because of it. 

Firstly, you're going to have to get used to this happening a lot. Girls generally don't like to go from just meeting a guy to opening their legs in one fluid motion because no girl likes to feel like a slut. So sometimes they will put up a resistance just as a token of their dignity. But the fact that they invite you back to their place shows that they're probably interested in having sex with you.

Try a little push-pull technique. Push until you meet resistance, then pull back a little, but don't give up. Back off for a few minutes then try again. Don't put pressure on her to put out, though, and don't act all disappointed and shit when she does resist (that's my best guess on why you're getting kicked out). Show her that you are comfortable and having a good time regardless of whether you're having sex, and make sure she's comfortable too. 

The obvious caveat is that if she's not budging at all, then you should stop. Always keep your cool and do not try to force anything if it's clear it's not happening that night."

for me music is 90% about how it makes me feel and 10% about the technical skills of the artists, so when someone tells me ""X-Band you like sucks and Y-band is way more skilled"" all i can really say is okay.

 If Y-Band can play circles around X-band but X-band plays with more emotion and makes me feel something and Y-band does not than im going to prefer X-band heavily anyway.

Shock collars can work in some situations beautifully, but not all. The emphasis is on where the pain is coming from, but also the type of dog. Not all dogs can handle positive punishment and come out confident in themselves, and don't even get me started on what ""domination"" can do to a dog.

You're not going to keep every student engaged.

Your girls in class may not be geeky science people. They might identify more as cheerleaders, or athletes, or goths, or punks, or any number of other stereotypes but *also be really awesome at CS.* So if the geek culture isn't reaching the whole class, tone it down or add in some other humor.

And make sure the work is actually challenging and the rewards represent real accomplishment. Yeah, candy or other small rewards can be good for the occasional Q&amp;A. But you're not going to get someone to go into a career in CS with candy - they have to see both their own potential and the exciting challenging things they can do in that field. 

I think having them develop their own project at some point could be really useful as /u/inchhighsam suggested. Listen to what interests them and see how they connect CS to their lives.

metamongoose,AskMen,1390784302.0,"Yeah you're not getting very helpful responses to this, which is a shame. I have had this problem for most of my life, but it's improving. I'm sure many other men have it, it's just not spoken of very much, because it's shameful. And the best thing about that is, that the reason for it is often something to do with shame as well!

I trained myself to get off really quickly as a teenager. I didn't have a very private room where I'd masturbate, and the fear of being discovered was always there. So I associate arousal with the need to get off quickly, and also with a sense of anxiety.

To improve the situation, I have to feel absolutely secure that the timing of my orgasm isn't important, and to be relaxed and very much in control, or very much out of control - so I can either concentrate fully on what I am doing, or relax completely. Anywhere in between and it gets tricky.

This is a problem that can be improved over time in a loving relationship. But the best thing you can do as a reaction is to shrug it off, make him feel appreciated, let him recover (it probably won't take long) and go for round two. Or get him off early on with your hands or mouth. 

I can't really answer your question about how common it is. But it will happen to all kinds of people, as it can have many causes. The causes are very unlikely to be anything to do with you, and will be something from puberty or before. A psychological issue that they haven't been able to address."

&gt; ruining the prestige of the marathon event,

?? What is this prestige you speak of? If marathon runners feel that they're too good to rub shoulders with people like her, that's their problem. It sounds like her fellow runners were cool about it.

&gt;She starts her marathon in the fastest corral (""one of the first out of the gate""), forcing more serious runners to zig-zag around her.

Perhaps nobody told her that she should start further back...this isn't something that a newbie would necessarily know first time out.

&gt;Took up one of the (presumably, based on the races I have run) few available toilet facilities for 25 minutes (!!).

She said that the break took 25 minutes. She didn't say she was in the bathroom for that whole time. Maybe there was a line up.

&gt;Forced a volunteer to spend over 12 hours of her time herding this selfish person across the finish line.

Read the word again: *volunteer*. This woman signed up to keep up with the people who were at the back of the group. She wasn't being forced to do anything - she volunteered for it, knowing that this marathon had no time limit and that it was possible she'd be there for a long time.

&gt;Probably fucked with traffic after closed roads were re-opened, forcing her to use road shoulders. Animosity from drivers caused by selfish runners affects us all.

An awful lot of my running has taken place on road shoulders. It's not that obtrusive, actually. And she didn't just do it on her own - ""we were told that  there would be no more mile markers, no more water and gatorade stations, no more port-a-potties, and since there weren‚Äôt sidewalks in a lot of places we had to walk on trails and lawns"". They were told that they'd have to do this by the people in charge.

&gt;She registered as a runner, not a walker.

And she ran. It was slow, but she did it.

&gt;But you can bet your ass this person is going to go back to work on Monday and tell all of her co-workers about how she is a marathoner.

Who the hell cares if she does?? She finished the marathon and she can call herself anything she wants.

&gt;The marathon is a serious distance that takes a serious commitment. 

And given that she found it immensely hard and painful, had huge blisters on her feet, was dead last and had people telling her to quit, and still finished, don't you think that shows commitment? For crying out loud, man, most people would have given up but she stuck with it. 

&gt;People like this idiot take away from the prestige of the event every time they tell someone they have run the marathon,

Well, we can't have someone like *you* having to be lumped in with a loser like *her*, now can we? Seriously, dude, get over yourself. She did something tremendously hard and she deserves to tell people that she did it, even publicly on her blog. It sounds like the other people who actually ran the race with her were okay with it...why aren't you? 

&gt;She does not take the distance seriously.

She took it incredibly seriously. She trained for months and she kept on even when she wanted to quit and everyone around her wanted her to quit.

I think you're just mad because she's fat and slow, and you don't want to be associated with people like her by letting her call herself a marathoner. Are you running for yourself or are you running for all this stupid ""prestige"" you speak of?? She runs for herself. You should too. You'd be happier and you wouldn't feel the need to get pissed off at strangers for doing things that make *them* happy, either."

girlaboutoaktown,sex,1390784810.0,"SF bay area has a few public sex clubs.  The one we went to was like, a weird sex-positive Burning Man offshoot.  You have to go in costume based on the theme, there's musical acts and bursleque shows, a couple bars, and a room in the back for sex.  But it was weird, there were all these rules.  We went because we were invited by a guy we were thinking about hooking up with.  My now-husband was fucking me while I was having a conversation with the guy, and they threw him out because apparently that was against the rules?  I tried to say I was cool with it but apparently not.  I actually didn't find it all that hot, but I'm just not an exhibitionist at heart.  I'm glad I did in a ""checked off THAT box!"" kinda way but I have no desire to go back.

Anyway, I feel you.  I have a hard time seeing anal as anything but a submissive act, tbh, which maybe isn't fair - I am sure there are couples for whom it's not - but it really feels that way for me.  And being subby I LIKE that part of it, unlike you.  But physically I don't like the sensation of it.  Even when it doesn't hurt/feel uncomfortable, at best it feels ""just weird"". On a physical level I don't understand how other women find PIA pleasurable.  I can get off like crazy via rimming while using a toy, or having a small plug up there while doing PIV, but an actual decently-sized dick?  Nawww.  

I feel kinda bad because I want to like it, but I just don't, and I'm OK with that, too.  I've told my husband that if he really wants to get his dick in there we can keep having long sessions with the tons of lube and graduating to differently sized plugs but so far he hasn't put in that amount of effort and I'm not gonna ask for something that doesn't do anything for me.

If you think you will be okay as long as you get into a ""top"" college, you're sorely sorry. 

People aren't lower than you in anyway just because they go to a local college, nor do they have it better. We all have different paths in life. Many successful people dropped out of college. Things are different in our years and they will be in the future regarding that. I'm just trying to say that college doesn't make the person, the person makes whatever he can out of his college days.

I personally think this indulges a lot of the cynicism fans might have of the series.

I wonder how many men would say that Zelda ""friend-zoned"" Link? I think that would be a narrow-minded response to the relationship between Link and Zelda, especially in Skyward Sword where they've explicitly been established as childhood friends (with no romantic bond). Also, there is no explicit mention of romantic ties between Link and Zelda throughout the series, so there is no reason to expect Zelda to fall for Link.

If anything, it's the supporting female characters who have crushes on Link (Marin from Link's Awakening, Princess Ruto, Saria, and Malon from Ocarina of Time, etc), so male gamers' potential focus on the relationship between Link and Zelda is also a case of men going for the ""perfect 10"" (not that I am implying attraction should be rated on a numbers scale, but just using that notion as a comparison between Zelda and less regal/divine supporting characters)."

Ultimately, she's just yet another young adult making her way through life in Hollywood. A lot of people seem to think that she's quite talented and good-looking. Agree or disagree all you want, but there's no need to call her an ""idiot"" or ""stupid"" just because you're not into her.

YoungFolks,ftm,1390786295.0,"I've got that binder and be warned- unless you're really small it won't flatten much. I'm about a B cup and I still get bumps when I wear. It's good enough to pass if I wear an extra layer or a looser shirt. 

Also, it closes with bra like hooks down the side. It can get awkward to close them. I strained a muscle once trying to close them all. It's also not elastic, so I can't just close the hooks then pull it on. That said, the tank part is quite nice and loose. It works on its own and as an undershirt. 

So, unless you're really small chested, you'd do better saving up to get a stretch material binder, like one from underworks or t-kingdom. 

As for tips, well don't wear it too long. If you're short of breath or it hurts, take it off. Use gold bond powder or something to keep dry. Don't toss the binder in the washing machine. 

Get some button down shirts. Darker colors and patterns will help disguise the chest. Make sure the shirt isn't too loose or too tight. About an inch or two wider than your widest point in your chest is the widest you should go. 

When buying pants, make sure they're not too tight in the thighs. You should be able to pinch an inch or two of fabric at the thigh. Look for slim or straight fit, and avoid skinny jeans. 

Buy some men's shoes or sneakers. They add a lot to a whole outfit. Belts are good too, if you want. 

I don't pack, so I can't give you much advice on that, other than keep it small and look at limp dick pics to figure out placement. 

For non clothing stuff:

You can start working out. Cardio and an appropriate diet to lower your body fat percentage. Weight training to bulk up. Concentrate on upper body, but don't ignore your legs. Ab work will help give you a boxier waist by lessening the curves. Shoulder work will give you broader shoulders and a more masculine line. 

You can practice voice training too. Deepening my voice helped a lot with my dysphoria, and even though I don't sound like I guy, I sound more like me than ever before. Sometimes I hit androgeny and that's great.

And that's all I can think of for now. Good luck, kid."

Pit_Sweat,AskMen,1390786777.0,"This comment is probably never going to get seen but here are my two cents:

You didn't give us a lot to work with. You did a great job of explaining how you feel, but what your OP basically boils down to is ""Help, I'm lonely and everyone treats me like a man and nobody hits on me and I don't know why."" But we can't really help you because in order to change, you can't be doing what you're doing now and we have no idea what it is you're doing now (although I didn't really read your additional comments).

Secondly, this whole situation is most likely not what you think it is. You're comparing your ""behind-the-scenes"" life to other people's highlight reels. What I mean is: yes, some girls do get a lot of male attention and get hit on a lot. True. But this happens a lot less often than you think. A lot of pretty girls out there are lonely too, and this is because:

Men are stupid. They do not ""go out of their way for women"" like you think they do. They *want* to, but the majority of men out there are pussies and will never act on those wants for anybody. Most guys get shot down a few times when they are young by some fake heartless bitch and they spend the rest of their lives afraid to make a move, wondering what's wrong with them.

So, the bottom line is, your results probably have more to do with *you* than with everyone around you. Your attitudes affect the world around you so much more than most people would think possible. What this means is that you can change. Of course, it's always possible that you're too ugly to be loved by anybody, but I highly, highly doubt that. I've never encountered anyone where that's the case.

So, having said all that, I'd be happy to help you if you want some specific advice."

carnageincminor,MakeupAddiction,1390786847.0,"**For brows:**

Because you have fair brows, you will want to be very light handed and use a light colour to fill and define them. Your brows can be slightly darker than your hair. There are specific brow kits and brow pencils for this purpose -- a regular eyeliner pencil will be too dark and creamy/thick for drawing on your brows. Some products include Anastasia Brow Wiz, Too Faced Brow Envy, Elf Brow Kit, Maybelline Brow Pencil, etc. They usually have a 'blonde' or 'ash' shade that can work for you.

**For face symmetry:**

Honestly, I had to scrutinise your photos a while to see what you meant, because most people don't notice the little things about our faces. Do you mean that your left cheekbone appears fuller than your right?

If that's the case, you can look into contouring which is 'sculpting' the face through the use of light and dark shades to create a desired contour. However, it can be tricky. You can look up some tutorials on youtube for a general idea. For your situation, you would want to highlight the right cheekbone more, and use blush/contour to give it more roundness. This is the theory, anyway, I can't guarantee it will look how you want it, but it may be worth a try. My personal opinion is that cosmetic surgery isn't necessary as it's not very visible at all. But the decision is yours ultimately.

**For skin:**

/r/SkincareAddiction could help you out with treatments, routines and product recommendations.

On the makeup side, have you tried using a face primer? It will smooth the texture of your skin somewhat so that foundation/concealer is more long lasting on your face, and hides bumps better.

Hope this helps!"

That way, the left hand/right hand issue would be moot because we wouldn't be playing with Wii Remotes.

Back to your question. The Wii was launching, Nintendo wanted a franchise flagship to ship it with, so Twilight Princess was the best candidate. Unfortunately, this means the launch of Twilight Princess is tied to the Wii, so if Twilight Princess needs to be delayed, they would have to delay the Wii as well. It might go without saying, but Nintendo was not going to delay the launch of the Nintendo Wii.

The Zelda development team has a workflow for in-game objects. Think of it as a factory line: they have to model the characters, attach skeletons to the characters to allow them to move (a process called ""rigging""), create animations for their movements, package them into the build, and debug the character in the build. 

What you are asking is why did they not simply skip steps one through... so many and just flip at step X? Well, we don't know if that was technically possible. If I had to flip the main character of my video game, the character players will see for the entire game fight, climb, walk, jump, solve puzzles, and swim...

I don't want to half-ass this process. Especially when I can't delay the game's release due to its tie with the Wii launch. Why risk a fiasco like that - destroying Nintendo's reputation for quality, near-bugless titles (think about how many years it takes for bugs to be observed in AAA Nintendo titles) - when flipping the entire screen would take less time? Yeah, the map will be flipped (Kakariko Village to the west, Gerudo Desert to the east, Deku tree to the southwest, etc.) but considering the lack of consistency between maps throughout the history of The Legend of Zelda most players will not notice it.

(I apologize, I take way too much time to explain these things than I probably should. But I thought a southpaw like you deserved a decent explanation for what I perceived as a glaring flaw... hey, how about an upvote if you like me spending 20 minutes writing this out? Whaddaya say!? :D)"

Advice though: You are getting way too worked up about all this. So a slutty girl offered your socially awkward and probably horny friend a blowjob, what did you think was gonna happen? She was not in a committed relationship with you so it's not like she was off limits to him. Plus, by that logic, you're just as bad as your friend because you got sucked off too right? And she had a bf this whole time?

The bottom line is, you let some slut mess you up emotionally and get in between you and your best friend. You're just as responsible for what happened as anyone else. Once you see how ridiculous this all is, I hope you can get a good grip on yourself"

And the guy sitting shiva was particularly unhappy with it, rightfully so.  Apparently the shul isn't doing so hot attendance-wise, and I'm growing more and more concern that the community won't survive the transition when the Rabbi retires.  It's a really strong community, and I don't want it to become a Bar-Mitzvah mill with membership on the rolls but not in seats.

So all in all, a rough weekend.  But I'm glad I was able to go home for the shiva call.

edit: I forgot that people in /r/christianity may not know what a shiva call is.  People mourning a close relative ""sit shiva"", where they're in mourning at home for a week.  Services are held at their house, you bring them food, talk with them if they want, and generally make sure they're taken care of.  A friend of mine's mom died rather unexpectedly, so a bunch of people from town traveled home to see them, which is called ""making a shiva call""."

So men and women have evolved instincts in order to attract each other in order to reproduce. Both sexes are encouraged by their instincts to groom their physical appearance in order to attract mates. Of course, we have brains and we are capable of ignoring our instincts and doing whatever we want but those powerful instincts are still there.

And some of us understand the loneliness. I'm a Marine wife, there are other military wives and military themselves in there often, was well as other ladies who are away from their spouses/significant others for extended periods for whatever reasons... as well as single mothers. We understand the loneliness.

So... it's not much, it's not face to face or even a voice, but if you want to chat with someone who understands, feel free to join us."

Half of the 13 year olds here are smokers. This is in one of the most anti-tobacco countries, too - a pack of smokes costs about $20, and there's been some talk of outright illegalizing tobacco in tasmania (they want a system where if you can prove you're a smoker, you can buy them, but no one else).

If anything, stronger regulation creates a stronger image of being 'cool' - just look at the way people view cannabis. I like the idea of banning the sales for people under 18, but the fact is people can get their hands on cigarettes easily, and the people who could benefit the most are young smokers - the sooner you switch, the less likely you'll have health complications later in life.

temp9876,Accounting,1390788715.0,"From what info you've given I think there really are 3 areas you need to master in order to ""understand"" assurance.  

1. Know your assertions upside down and backwards.  These are the basis of what are you doing and why for absolutely everything you do.

2. The format of your files.  This is entirely firm dependent.  You've got to know where to look to understand where your risks are and where your focus should be, that info is dictated by the planning process so you don't have to decide where the risks are or what's material, you just need to know where to go to find out.

3. Time management.  Maybe you get most of the above but you don't use your time effectively and end up looking like you didn't know what you were doing because you wasted time on less vital sections.  You've got to understand that a section budgeted 1 hour of your time is basically not expecting you to use any brainpower on it.  

These are mostly things that come with experience in A&amp;A and not things that you can book-learn.  Even if you know your assertions, it takes time to understand what your firm's standards are for addressing them.  Don't forget either, these comments are someone's *perceptions* of your performance, they could be completely mistaken in the causes of your difficulties.  Maybe it isn't that you aren't applying your knowledge, it's that you don't know *how*.  Those are two very different things.  The best tip I can give you is to get more A&amp;A time.  If you're spending 80% of your time on tax you're not getting the experience to build on in audit that will lead to improvement."

OriginalStomper,pics,1390789061.0,"Missed this one the first time around.  Is it your understanding that ESOPS are 100% owned by employees?  That is not my understanding at all.  It might be true, though, if we counted all the small, family-owned and start-up companies -- but that just leads us back to the question of entrepreneurship.  Why would anyone bother?  I actually understood that ESOPS included all companies offering stock to employees, which would include virtually all publicly traded corporations.

I'm not opposed to the idea of workers electing management.  As you say, it is not much different than a corporate board selecting top management, which then selects junior management.  The only real difference is that (at least for publicly traded companies) some or all board members may well have a track-record proving they have some ability (or at least experience) identifying good managers.  That's a legitimate skill, even if difficult to teach or identify.

In any event, I  don't have much reason to believe worker elections will work reliably on a large scale.  Anecdotal examples don't prove anything, and are the opposite of ""empirical proof"" the phenomenon can be reliably repeated.

Please stop trying to shift the burden to me.  You have yet to give a conceptually sound reason why communism should be tried and expected to succeed at a national level, or how plants would ""compete"" for limited resources.  Indeed, what happens when the limited resource needed by different plants is *managerial expertise*?

I'll concede (as I have from the beginning) that anecdotal examples show collectives can succeed when they exist within a larger, non-collectivized economy (a) from which they can acquire personnel and other resources, and (b) into which they can market products and services while expelling personnel who do not fit.  How does this translate into your ideal state?"

Concerning cigars (cigarettes being obviously quite different:)



‚ÄúIt is true that tobacco, though not an intoxicant, is in some sense a drug: but so is tea. It is true that tobacco, taken out of season and reason, spoils your appetite: but so do sweets. It is true that it is a luxury, a mere keen and passing titillation or pungency: but so are peppers and salt and mustard and a hundred other blameless gifts. It is true that it ends in smoke: but so do all the worldly powers and pleasures. It is true that it falls into ashes: but so do we. There is nothing immoral about smoking a cigar. To regard smoking as immoral shows not merely a lack of clear thinking but a lack of clear standards. Lumping the wrong things together as evils blurs the real lines between right and wrong and leads to chaos. It also leads to legal and practical confusion.""

That said, I am sorry your experience has been so crappy.  My main impetus was that you do understand many faith issues but still have a very world-conformed view of Scripture (it having been informed, presumably, by one-sided un-or-marginally-believing education.)


The best possible cure for such being, of course, to actually read the scriptures, pray, and read independently of sources that presume to encourage faith rather than impart sophistication.


Statistically few professors (what else does one do with a Bible degree after their unyielded pastoral career tanks?) are active believers, but those that are are in a position to exert more excellent influence than probably anyone outside governmental leadership.  I pray for them often.


The difference between a (faith-wise) conservative and liberal education is that the conservative one teaches both views.  God's testimonies have nothing to fear from transparency and integrity, but untold thousands of bitter and unprofessional instructors shield their students from the facts about God."

Once you give M44 a try and if you decide you want something a LITTLE more complex, you should try Combat Commander:Europe.    

It doesn't have the cool figures, but it is still a two player game.  It also plays out in around an hour (lets give it 2 hours for your first few games) and has a ton of scenarios to try.  You can also use the Random Scenario Generator if you are interested in making your own.  I haven't bothered because the official scenarios are enough.  Much like M44 there are multiple expansions to keep the game fresh and interesting.

Either of these games are also available to play on VASSAL should you decide that you would like to try that out.

Well I go try to fan it down so it stops beeping then the popcorn starts burning and the whole house is filled with smoke. I get the pan off the stove top and just chuck the whole disaster in the trash and watch tv.

ObsidianOne,AskMen,1390790702.0,"Attraction is not just physical, it's emotional, personality, and confidence. The way you look, talk, walk, and just act in general around people is what defines you, for the most part.  

I'm male, but I understand how you feel. I used to be in the same boat, when I was about 15 or 16.  
What helped this problem, was good friends. They pulled me out of the house, they make me 'come out of my shell'.  
Nobody likes someone who is extremely cocky (well, aside from people with issues of their own, but that's another topic), but confidence speaks lengths about you.  

It's entirely possible that you are just intimidating, believe it or not, guys act brave all the time, but a lot aren't.
The rules state "" Do not post pictures here looking for positive affirmation on your appearance."", but I feel this might be for a different purpose and this may be an exception. Message the mods and ask them if it is okay, if you're comfortable that is. Might help us give a better outlook on the situation.  

&gt;I've always been treated like a man. Guys always treated me like one of the guys or like I was invisible, despite me not acting like one of the guys. Girls treat me like a guy too -- acting girly and helpless around me, always asking for help, using me to dump all their feelings on, or also like I'm invisible.  


Fairly certain this is due to the way you act, not a negative thing, but as I stated before, a lot of guys find strong women intimidating. As far as girls, they probably see that you are strong and that you let them dump their feelings on you (fairly certain the latter is just a common trait among women though).  


&gt;It seems like men go out of their way for most women. They like them, love them, cherish them, care about them, want to protect them, watch them, and need them. I was never one of those women. I've seen some say they feel disposable because they are a man. I'd say that's how I feel too.  
This sounds a lot like my girlfriend. I treat her like a girly girl, because I care about her. I worry about her when she walks somewhere alone (which drives me bonkers).  

If I didn't address something that you wanted me to, please let me know :)"

There may even be a way for you to not to press charges. Perhaps you and your lawyer can work out some agreement for supervised visitation in exchange for not pressing charges against him, I don't know, but this guy sounds dangerous.

If you can, please find some way to make sure she doesn't have that happen to her. It could seriously screw her up down the road (if I'm anything to go by, that is.)

What is this, the 14th century? I'm a woman. I have a body. I can do what I want with it. If I want to wear a nun's robes and never show my ankles, that's my choice. If I want to show the world my boobs, that's also *my* choice. Nobody has the right to tell me that I should be ashamed for being proud of my body.

In truth, most of my friends have seen me topless before. I had a friend or two in high school who liked to pull my strapless dresses down when we got drunk. My family is pretty sex-positive, and I'm an adult, so if my parents see that I've basically made my own porn, they'll understand.

macgalver,ReadMyScript,1390791554.0,"Hey there /u/BonfireinRageValley, I saw your post in Screddit and I wanted to give you a huge congratulations on getting this far in your pilot. It's an amazing step forward to get it all down on paper! Again, I'm not a professional, but I have been doing these breakdowns for school so I might be able to offer a bit of insight. I'll try to break down some possible issues into different categories.

FORMAT:

* SLUGLINES - the format is a bit off. It's ""INT. HOUSE - NIGHT"" You don't have to say ""unknown family"" because...well we don't know them. CAPITALIZE your slugs, and if your moving room, but not location (i.e. to Their child's room) you can capitalize all of that or use ""ANGLE ON THEIR CHILDS ROOM"".
* No colons after character names. 
* Also try to avoid saying ""We"" - it's tempting to speak to the audience in the script, but it's much more concise and visual to say it without saying ""we see"".
* Gerund is the enemy. Avoid ""ing"". It's three extra characters taking up space. Also ALWAYS present tense. About half way through you forget about that for a little bit, around page 15.
* Unless you plan to film the piece yourself, don't include camera moves until the shooting script. Directors don't like to be directed. If you believe that a camera move is indispensable to the storytelling write so as to trick the director into thinking it's his own idea. Describe how the scene is laid out - rather than what's in/out of focus: the script becomes nearly unreadable with all the camera directions.
* A lot of the parentheses can just be plain ""Action"" text. Also parentheses are usually used under the character's name. The ""she is fearing for her life"" parenthesis comes across in the text and is totally unnecessary.
* Capitalize your characters names the first time you meet them in the script. Even if they don't have speaking roles, it's generally acceptable to give them names.
* Please, please, please proofread. And put periods at the ends of your sentences. 
* ""Max tried but couldn't think of anything to counter his comment"" Don't write internal monologue. The actor/director will interpret this. This is superfluous. And don't write interior monologue as dialogue. Don't write interior monologue at all. Film and Television are visual. You can't peer inside someone's head. It has to come out on the screen or else it doesn't come out at all.

STRUCTURE:

* Your structure started out good, but then sorta lost it's way. Television dramas usually have a teaser, four acts and then a tag. The story hits its climax In the second act rather than the third, if anything, I would suggest swapping the third act with the second. The episode needs to build rather than taper.
* During your Second act you need more description of the fighting. I hear quips and one liners but I can't PICTURE what's going on.

* However, I have some questions about the serial elements of this piece. Is it a monster of the week show? In it's current incarnation it's not long enough to be a full hour long drama. What does your typical episode of this show look like? Does the drama from the teaser ever factor into the overall story or is it just a vignette of the madness that's befell the town?

Again, congratulations on the first draft! It takes a lot of work and courage to complete and share this with a group of complete strangers on the internet, and I hope I don't come across too harsh. The script can be improved vastly by just making some format tweaks. The structure needs some reworking. PM me if you're interested in some books on television/screenwriting that I've found super helpful. Hope this stuff helps.

Jeanne de Clisson

Born Jeanne-Louise de Belleville in 1300, Jeanne was the descendent of a British family and lived in Brittany. In 1330, Jeanne married Olivier III de Clisson. A wealthy nobleman, Olivier was obliged to defend Brittany from English claimants. After failing to defend Vannes, he defected to the English. Captured in 1343, Olivier was taken to Paris and executed under orders from King Philip VI. Jeanne, overcome with anger, swore vengeance on the king.

She sold her lands and her body to rich noblemen and bought three warships. The ships were painted black and their sails dyed red, and the ‚ÄúBlack Fleet‚Äù took to the seas and hunted down ships belonging to King Philip VI. Clisson butchered the crew of the ships she captured, leaving only a few sailors alive to tell the King that the Lioness of Brittany had struck again. Even after Philip‚Äôs death in 1350, she continued to lay waste to French ships, until 1356 when she retired to England‚Äîthe only place where people liked the French just about as much as she did.

Take it from me. I started with drugs pretty early as well. But believe me when I say: drugs do not make you inherently cool. They are not casual things to fuck around with. They can ruin your life in ways that you honestly can't see right now because you haven't lived that much of your life yet. 

You have so much going for you still -- starting high school, right? You have so many choices for your future. I know the feeling of wanting to brag, wanting to prove how I wasn't like everyone else, that I had leapt into the dangerous life hard and fast. Taking every ""you're way too young to __"" as a personal challenge.  One day you might be comfortable enough in who you are that you won't feel the need to show off all the substances you've done, seeking that admiration and fear from others. I was confident too; I thought I had the self-control to never let something take over my life that way. I have since learned that I was wrong. And thank god I had understanding people around me who had lived through my mistakes and helped me start again. 

So go ahead and smoke meth. I can't stop you. But hopefully I can make you pause and think for a moment. You have so much time still. "

POGtastic,AskReddit,1390792581.0,"I think that some of my opinions line up with feminism, but I'm frustrated with a lot of the things that feminists seem to treat as dogma. I'm also annoyed with the way that a lot of feminists discuss gender issues - they seem more interested in shutting down dissent and enforcing their opinions by fiat rather than having a genuine discussion.

As for treating women as equals, it really depends on what you mean by ""equal."" From a standpoint of rights, I think that women should be treated exactly the same as men. But from a strict ""[==](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C%2B%2B#Comparison_operators.2Frelational_operators)"" sense of equality, I think that we're different. For example, I do not treat women the same in conversation; I'm a lot less foul-mouthed, use fewer crass analogies, and refrain from a lot of the sarcastic banter that I will use in male conversation. Most of this is because I'm a much worse judge of acceptable behavior when it comes to women, so I err on the safe side.

One more thing is that self-avowed feminists just seem to be so *hostile* to men. I'm not a bad guy, (Would I lie to you on the Internet?) or at least I don't consider myself to be a bad guy. But because I don't self-flagellate every day and just shut the fuck up like a good white-cis-heterosexual male should, I'm a monster. I usually just shrug and say, ""Well, okay then. I guess I have some other things that I could be doing. Gee, that grill needs cleaning.""

Here's a pretty good test to see if I'm a feminist. Last year, the former Secretary of Defense [released a statement](http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=119098) that demonstrated his intent to open up combat arms to women. There was a lot of backlash from the military community.

Under my current understanding, feminists' response to this backlash was basically ""They're a bunch of sexist assholes who are just scared of relinquishing their privilege, and their arguments have no merit."" If that's what feminists really think, then I'm not a feminist."

Tip 3: Learn how to not care when there are people in earshot. There will almost always be people in earshot.

Tip 4: Since it sounded like you guys were finishing your workouts around the same time, you could have waited for/caught up with her on the way out and talk to her then.

I think 30 minutes is completely manageable, and since you know you've got a bit farther to go you can keep that in mind when deciding when the time is right to get moving.  If it is a bit farther, you might consider scoping out a good restaurant, coffee shop, or park to while away some time at if you feel you're not quite ready to check in.  Not that you should be labouring in a restaurant mind you, but if you do get sent home because it's too early, it might be nicer to grab a bite and take a walk in the park to see if things get moving rather than driving all the way home and back again shortly after.  Also, if it is a neighbourhood you're not familiar with, check out where the good take-out and slurpees are.

perryw,crossfit,1390793069.0,"It is a VERY humbling experience.  I just finished the ""foundations"" course last week, so I'm not at all experienced in the sport.  I ran a 1:52 half marathon and sub-23 minute 5k in November, so *thought* I was in ok shape.  I was proven very wrong!

I was / am a runner, but I need to lose some weight and gain some strength for a GORUCK event later this year.  The small-ish workouts we did were very challenging and I finished towards the back of my 7-person class on each of them.  But, the other people in the class were very supportive and cheered me on as I struggled through the burpees and jump ropes.  Shoot, one of my goals now is to do 20 pushups and a single pullup -- yes, just one!

I've stumbled through gyms before, but I've really never known what I was doing and never had any sort of support structure.  I got bored / frustrated because I really had no clue what I was doing and chose machines and exercises almost at random.  Having coaches around and a community to be a part of will be major motivators in helping me stay motivated and continue improving.  I think Crossfit will be great for someone that came from a team sport background and likes having a group of people to offer support.

I am fortunate in that I have 2 boxes each about 3 miles from my house.  I tried the first and really liked it, so that's the one I went with.  But look around, go to their free sessions, and make up your mind for yourself."

Once I paid, I was getting messages left and right, from all sorts of girls, mainly Koreans looking for a white guy.  I was able to have sex with 3-4 girls over the site, all of which were Asian, which were firsts for me. Better yet, I met my girlfriend over KoreanCupid, we fell in love, and the rest is history. I think maybe the stigma over online dating in USA is more negative than it is in Korea.  The dating sites I used in USA seemed to be full of girls that were either trashy, ugly, teen moms, overweight, etc etc. I never found a real, genuine, down to earth attractive girl over a dating site in USA. However, with KoreanCupid, I don't know what it is. Maybe it's because it's a paid site, or maybe I just got really lucky, but I thought that site was full of beautiful girls that were normal.  There were some crazy Korean girls that only wanted a white man to marry and leave Korea with, but in general, very positive reviews from KoreanCupid. Unfortunately, I don't have any advice regarding dating sites in America, as I also haven't had any luck. Good luck!"

Saying ""no"" is unfortunately a lot harder than it sounds. Men are usually bigger and stronger, and sometimes it's scary to say ""no"" to some one who can ignore that easily. Might be hard to see (my male friends were shocked at the concept) but you may be a bit scarier than you intend to be.

Perhaps this would not be the same case for, say, Pitcairn.  Jurisprudence is a key part of Christian living, since not all situations are the same.



It absolutely is not in the fear or obedience of Christ at all, though, to knowingly promote sin.  This is what it means to ""cause these little ones to stumble"" and probably harsher descriptions would also be appropriate.

I also posted below the studies that prove that spanking has long term detrimental effects. However, I am not making the claim that occasional spanking will have lasting damage. But how will you know what will and will not effect the child adversely? Not spanking certainly won't. Here are the studies:

I know my 5 year old does, but my grandma died when he was 3 and we've been able to explain it through that. That's anecdotal so it's useless evidence. 

There are studies to prove that regular spanking causes detrimental effects, do you know of any that prove that the lack of spanking does? I'd be sincerely interested in reading them. What evidence do you have that spanking is good for a child?

CrookedSprite,IAmA,1390794211.0,"Some people seem to naturally be inclined that way. From what I've read it's a little less biological than sexual orientations, but no more controllable.

Erotic age orientations are a thing, and are usually uncomfortable for the people that have them (especially for kids and young teenagers). They're often ashamed/confused/horrified/etc. when growing up that the ages of people they're attracted to hasn't changed with them. It is apparently a rather unsettling experience, especially in a society that loathes them for simply feeling that way.

Acting on that is always wrong in my opinion, but I guess it's really stressful to have that on you at all times. To have to hide what you like because others would think you're a monster or something. Some people keep it internal and try to not hurt anyone in the process, some watch child abuse ""porn"", and some people go out and actually commit those crimes.

I've also never really known where to start researching, so seeing you a) actually live the dream, and b) answer a lot of questions is awesome!  A few questions, if I may.  

* What are some things you wish you had known before you bought the boat and ""moved in"", so to speak?

* How did you learn to sail, since you've said you had no prior experience?

* What drew you to this particular boat/style of boat, over something more modern or something bigger/smaller?

* How did you begin the process of finding the boat, and how far was your search radius once you started looking?  I assume lots of online research and maybe something like autotrader but for boats?

Thanks for taking the time to answer questions, and thank you for your service to our country!"

Are you arguing that children seek to punish each other in the way their parents do? That children are very likely to use a punishment they witness against another child? I haven't really seen any evidence in years of working with children. If anything a it is lack of discipline/consequences that inspires poor behavior.  


If that is the case, any form of punishment would be bad as it would only inspire children to treat each other poorly. We wouldn't want children to ground each other, take away each other's toys, or send others to time out.

marcm6246,AskReddit,1390795029.0,"I was a very horny 14 year old and I came across the fleshlight. After reading reviews and watching it in action, I decided I really wanted one. One problem, I had no credit card. But I saw you could pay by money order - so I sold a bunch of my video games, asked my parents for 'lunch' money, etc etc... Just saved up any money I could. The thing was expensive, 80 bucks for the case/sleeve and 30 bucks for shipping (to Canada). Finally had enough money saved up and headed for the post office. Told them I was ""needing a money order to buy a gift for my parents"" and played it off great. Got my money order, payed by debit and had it sent in, woo!

Except here's the thing, I paid my debit. When my debit card account history came in the mail a while later my parents saw a 110 dollar transaction at the pharmacy (where the post office was) and their tone was not good at all, this is coming from the kid who usually had small 1 - 5 dollar debit transactions for treats. I was hoping to get to the debit card statement before they did.

If this wasn't already a ""oh god, what have I done"" moment, they were heading to a concert so I just laughed and said i'd explain it when they got back. I panicked so much once they were gone - what could I say? What would a 14 year old be needing to spend 110 bucks on? Ahh!

For some reason the best explanation to me at the time was that ""I bought 10 bucks worth of candy, but they charged me an extra zero by accident"", not a good idea. My dad freaked out, called the post office/pharmacy and I was quickly discovered. I still tried to deny it, but my father just said if you don't confirm it was you, they could lose their jobs. This was the biggest ""oh god, what have I done!"" moment for me.

Made up another corny lie that I bought a 'Nintendo DS microphone repair kit' since my DS mic was busted at the time (because, you know, they would have costed that much). But I found out through awkward circumstances the following year that they did indeed trace back my money order to Fleshlight... Dear lord, I hope none of you have to go through this. 

**TL;DR bought a fleshlight with a money order paid by debit, lied and said it wasn't me and almost had 2 postal workers fired in the process.**"

Some people pull their kinks out of the bedroom into their home life, but it is with the understanding that BOTH partners are getting what they need and not exposing the other to serious harm.

I think if you are still friends with this woman, you need to recommend that she seek a therapist before she ends up in a truly abusive relationship. It may feel comfortable because of her past, but it certainly is not healthy and it will drag her down.

Please do not feel bad for being someone who wants and is capable of having a healthy relationship. I would let this girl go for now. It's obviously not the right time for her to be in any relationship, and you deserve someone who wants the type of person you are.

geetar_man,battlestations,1390795391.0,"No, don't leave. Reddit downvotes the rest of your stuff immediately unless you seriously change your thinking.

You can do two things:

1. Go down with your ship and get downvoted.

2. Just give nice responses. You can see the responses that have upvotes are the nice ones and the ones have the downvotes are the ones bashing the downvoters (calling them ""circle-jerk""-ers) or trying to justify your title. 


Don't say sorry to me. There is nothing to apologize about. I'll tell you exactly the reason for downvotes; you received them because it was perceived as vanity. Regardless of whether or not you were consciously intending for it, you were subconsciously proud of having such a good computer for your age, and don't you deny that. I have never seen ANYBODY over 18 post their age with their battlestation. Have you ever seen ""I'm 42 and here's my station!""?

Don't you think that would be weird? A 42 year old promulgating his age with his station?

Everybody who posts here is proud of their station. You are obviously proud of it, too. That's okay. But when you post your age along with the station, the title has some very poorly received connotations to it. 

Sorry you had to learn that the hard way, but that's life. I haven't seen any hate, either. The cliche is certainly tired, but ""hate"" really is a strong word. Nobody hates you, dude. You'll just have to accept the downvotes. What you have said has been done, but what you said wasn't so strong that anybody would hate you for it; what you said only warranted one comment: ""no one cares about your age."" Sure, it might have been nasty to replace ""cares"" with ""shit"" but he still has the point, and the point wasn't seen so negatively that we believed the commentor was so much of a jerk about it.

Don't leave a site because of this, dude. Nobody hates you. We don't dislike you. We don't have negative feelings for you.

Nice battlestation.

I've spent many nights wandering alone in the rain, soaked to the skin and contemplating existence. Ultimately I learned two things from this: your internal soliloquy is capable of some profound truths if you can be bothered to put them to writing when you get home, and to paraphrase a favorite book of mine, being wet stops being bothersome when you've accepted that you will be soaked and stop trying to walk under awnings and shelters.

CrazyPlato,dresdenfiles,1390795692.0,"You need to remember that Martin is trying to be deliberately amoral in ASOIAF. The point he has tried to get across is that his world isn't one of good vs. evil, and there's no reason to assume that noble good will prevail. We see every character, even the ""good"" ones, has a flaw, a darker blemish which compromises this concept. The few people in his books who've managed to be actively and genuinely ""good"", like Ned Stark, are quickly wiped out. The point here is that the world isn't run by good or evil, it's run by greed and selfishness: people don't act out of morals, they act in their own self-interest.

Harry Dresden's universe isn't the same. There's a distinct presence of Good and Evil; we've seen agents of both of them (Demons and angels, as well as the knights of the cross and the Denarians). Though there several neutral parties in between, there is an established belief in the books that characters can benefit from an effort to be noble and good, even when they aren't the best at it.

I could see Harry being moved by the slaughter of a large number of his friends, but Harry lives in a state of sacrifice every day now. He's given up so much of his life already in the pursuit of his duty. Honestly, he doesn't have many friends to begin with at this point. I could see maybe one close friend dying to move him, but not a large-scale event like the Red Wedding. That was a tool Martin used to shock the readers and remind them that Robb Stark and his army (rapidly becoming a ""good"" faction) wasn't going to get ahead just by being good. His world is cold and uncaring. Butcher's isn't."

POGtastic,AskReddit,1390795787.0,"Yep, I think so. I'm in agreement with feminists that there *are* a lot of misogynistic douchebags out there, and that these guys really do use their privilege to fuck with women. In my time in the military, I've seen sexual harassment, ""fraternization"" that was actually coerced sexual assault, and a variety of jackassery that just made things shitty for women. It's not okay. It's not just ""boys being boys;"" it's men treating fellow human beings like shit because they can get away with it, and it needs to stop.

At the same time, there are a lot of differences between men and women, and we need to acknowledge that as well. For example, there is absolutely nothing inherently wrong with the standard gender roles of men providing for the family while women raise the kids. And there's nothing wrong with this being the norm. It just needs to be okay for the reverse to happen too. There's nothing wrong with a woman quitting her career to raise kids (and the wage gap that results from it). It just needs to be okay for her to stick with her career as well (and there shouldn't be a wage gap for these women, as they're working just as hard as the men are). That's what I'd like feminism to be. I don't know if I'm in the (relatively silent) majority or if I'm a lone voice to be shouted down and burned at the stake.

One random aside - one thing that frustrates me with feminists is talking about date rape and rape culture in general. I recall a massive uproar over a college publishing a pamphlet that tried to educate women on being safe. It included things like only getting drinks in bottles, not getting blackout drunk, and staying with your friends. The feminists went batshit insane over it because they thought it was ""blaming rape victims"" and insinuating that rape victims deserved it. This left a bad taste in my mouth because it's actually making women more vulnerable to predators, (as they're uninformed of predators' strategies and how to be a hard target) and feminists didn't give a fuck because it didn't fit their political narrative of changing human nature.

That being said, I'm aware that feminism is a *big* movement, ranging from people who are conscious of gender issues to the complete nutballs who want to castrate all men. It just seems like the crazies dictate the movement by shouting louder than everyone else, just like the Tea Partiers dominate the Republican party by shouting down all non-extremist opinions. Despite being conservative, I don't identify as a Republican because of them."

I stopped online dating after that. He was really the only guy worth a damn I met there, and he turned out to be scum, so I was pretty much turned off from it. I basically used online dating as confirmation that I was still attractive after a horrible relationship left my confidence in shambles.

thesilvertongue,changemyview,1390796660.0,"The problem with the these studies and the majority of them like it is that they do not define spanking nor distinguish it from other forms of aggression against children, like smacking them in a fit of rage. When physical punishments are so vaguely defined as anything from a ""slap on the wrist"" to a punch in the face, it is no surprise that healthcare providers are against it. One need only examine the word choices to know that both studies have a heavy anti-spanking bias. 

One study mentioned a video of a boy being ""yelled at, shaken, and spanked with paddle"". Well obviously that's not a helpful way of molding a child's behavior. It's a waste of a study. When spanking includes random aggression against a child, it's bound to skew results. 

To study discipline with an unbiased angle one would have to compare a consistent well intentioned safe physical discipline tactics with consistent safe well intentioned discipline of another variety i.e. spanking vs scolding/timeout/no dessert. Sadly, I have yet to find a study which examines the issue adequately. 

Based in this we might conclude that cost/benefits of spanking remain unknown. Even we had proven generalizations or correlations, the very diverse nature of individuals and relationship makes it impossible to know the best solution for every single problem regardless of context. Spanking might usually be a poor form of discipline, but it some case be necessary or beneficial. 

Even if it were proven to be a less effective form of discipline at all times one might still be wrong in calling it ""immoral"". A less effective solution does not mean an ""immoral"" or ""evil"" solution. 

It is a bit harsh to call a loving, well intentioned parent ""immoral"" solely for using a form of discipline you find ineffective. "

And the quality of imports is crap. There's a tiny number of producers who absolutely dominate the market. If you're in South America and know the right people, you can get good product, but outside the country you can only buy shit, and I'm not precisely sure why.

I think part of the reason marijuana above all others has been successful is because there's lots of growers, lots of strains, good competition that has really changed the plant over the last few decades. There's not so much competition in cocaine, nobody is innovating, there's just cartels siphoning money from crack addicts.

Kinda. There was always the primary route. Basically there was a route that I was looking to first and the play was set up to try to get that WR/TE free. There was a progression of looks. So say the X receiver wasn't open, then the play dictates I should check the Z receiver, then the Y TE, and then look to dump it off or run. All in about 3 seconds.
 
&gt; 2) Whats a checkdown? Is that like ok designated reciever is covered too well, time to check the others and either throw or dump it off?

A checkdown is when you dumb the pass off to a RB who is leaking out of the backfield. Usually this means all of the other options weren't open as I stated above.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1390797883.0,"&gt;Especially when that role can be filled Rasta Shaman, or basically any stun.

No, it can't. 

Concoction is a unique stun. Although it's certainly a lot more risky than almost any other stun, the risk is minimized if you play well, yet you can still reap huge benefits. How many spells in the game do physical damage? Not many at all. Concoction does a load of physical damage, which means it is easily amplified by medallion and acid spray. This leads to a stun that is almost unparalleled in damage. The duration is awesome, too. There aren't a whole lot of non-ultimate non-channeled 4 second stuns in the game, and this spell is aoe to top it all off. I can't name how many teamfights got ruined because two or more heroes were hit by the stun.

The stun alone is potent enough to warrant using him as a support. He has an endless mana pool, especially since bonus mana regen from rage is multiplied by items. He's also ridiculously hard to kill as a support once he hits 6. Is Shadow Shaman tanky? Hell no.

Not to mention that he scales quite a bit better than other supports. Greevil's Greed isn't an amazing skill for a support, but it's still quite useful.

Alchemist suffered the same fate that Naga did around TI3. Everyone already knew that Alchemist had awesome skills, just like Naga. They realized they can run this hero as a support, and still reap most of the benefits of his skills anyway. This lets them use a hero that would be better suited to carrying."

CrazyPlato,Homebrewing,1390798018.0,"Listing the ABV isn't a bad idea, but I think for most people the majority of the info on your label will be meaningless. I'd say the gravity readings are particularly unneeded, as they're mainly just used to determine the ABV anyway. If this is for you personally, to keep track of the beers you've brewed, then go ahead. But if you're passing this to your friends and family, you may want to go for some simplicity.

If you're making a memorable beer label, I'd recommend placing emphasis on the name and the logo. [Many](http://images.meredith.com/fitness/images/2009/09/ss_BudLightBottleWet.jpg) [commercial](http://eatwisconsin.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/miller.jpg) [beers](http://images.pictureshunt.com/pics/c/coors_light_bottle-3148.jpg) focus specifically on the name, because it's what they want you to remember about the beer.

hallflukai,Saxophonics,1390798033.0,"I would say air support is probably your best bet. When you play, you should be using your diaphragm to push the air through the saxophone. The sound should be created with air, not with mouth pressure. It's not necessarily that you're playing super loudly, just that the air your pushing through the saxophone has a lot of support and strength behind it. It's that air strength that helps all registers of the saxophone really sing out, it makes your tone more full, and surprisingly it will even let you play softer if you have good support! It really will make a world of difference to your playing. 

You really should change that mouthpiece. A 4C is a great beginner's piece but that's pretty much all they're good for. I could spout out my own recommendations, but it's really up to the player and what's comfortable for them.
