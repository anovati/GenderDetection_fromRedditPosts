I'm against only being able to use an app if it's only financial source is advertising. I'm not against adverting that goes along with media and content consumption services however. I'm for that type of advertising model. I like an app that is an end product that I can buy. I may be old school, but that's how I grew up. An app is a product to me. I am about choice too. Apps that offer paid for options I go with. My method usually involves looking at an app. If there's not way to pay for it, I delete it.

The decline of education is another favourite thing to get some jimmies rustled, too. Everything else it just treats with general hysteria and negativity. 

You're spot on about the opinion articles. There is some truly nasty, spiteful stuff in there, but of course the Mail can just shrug and claim that it's not their opinion, just the columnist's. I also think that the website's comments aren't reflective of the people who buy the physical paper, probably because the internet is, generally speaking, a demographic which is quite young and liberal. 

The article was pretty good, and maybe it'll go that little bit into some Mail reader's brain to convince them that same sex couples are just human and in love, not terrifying aliens. "

But I did all that while paying all my own bills, holding a good job, taking care of business.  Now I go out less but I stay home to play lego with my kids and it's brilliant too.

Being called immature means nothing, you've got to find out WHY and evaluate whether there is something to it or not."

* Red Hulk is able to absorb energy. He got the surfboard by stealing the power cosmic from the Silver Surfer.

* Blackheart once kidnapped the Spirit of Vengeance. Red Hulk freed Spirit of Vengeance and temporally became Ghost Rider as a result. During that same battle, Flash let Red Hulk borrow the Venom symbiote. Red Hulk returned Venom and Vengeance to their true owners later on.

* At one point, the Impossible Man [merged the Red and Green hulks together](http://i.imgur.com/PISovOd.jpg).

* Also, Red Hulk [once stole Thor's hammer](http://i.imgur.com/nNVgtA0.jpg) by flinging Thor into space and taking advantage of the zero gravity.

Think of how many literary classics were considered failures on release, and only decades later were considered to be worth reading.  We tend to think of games, however, in a sense of years rather than decades.

And in a sense, that's understandable, as for the most part, games haven't been around decades.  But how many 30+ year old games would people list as a gaming classic that must be played?  Look at those best games of all time list, and they're practically completely different every decade.  Of course, there's another philosophy that states you can't really compare subjects from different generations.  And in that sense, a game from 30 years ago is multiple generations removed.  It would be like trying to compare Shakespeare to modern literature.  Sure, one might make an argument that Shakespeare is worth reading (whereas it should be in my opinion, watched, not read), but I don't think it's necessary because it's too far removed from our culture to appreciate fully.  Just in the same way that older games can't really be appreciated by the younger generation because they grew up with certain things always existing in their life (or games) to have a good grasp on what a revolution the original game made."

The goal is to have people climbing the ladder.

Or ... if you don't really want to climb the ladder... you should be comfortable enough in a job that you can afford the necessities and maybe some luxuries.

There are some people who have enough and they say, ""This is not enough and life isn't fair to me.  I think that the people on top should pay even more and redistribute it to me.""  (Even though the wealthy pay the vast majority of income taxes and the poor pay none.)

There are some people who have enough and they say, ""I have enough... but I'd like a little more, so I'm going to further my education and look for something that will provide me with more.""

There are some people who have enough and say, ""I have enough and I feel fortunate because I know there are folks in other countries who only dream of what I have.""

There are some people who know that since we first started fighting the war on poverty...poverty has remained the same.  We're not winning the war.

The way it works here is that a person either works for an employer... or BECOMES an employer.  To do the latter, you need to invest your own money...manage and pay employees and you follow regulations and take all the risk.

And then, because you finally made a million ... others decide that it isn't fair.

During my BSW program, I was able to manage working a part-time job 17 hours a week on top of my practicum. It was a bit hectic and there were times I felt ill due to stress, but I got into the groove of things and feel that I really benefited from the challenging experience. Instead of an apartment, I rented a room in someone's house, which was not my ideal scenario, but it was the cheapest option. Because my paycheck barely covered rent, gas, and bills, I was also on food stamps during that time.

I then took a year off in-between my BSW and MSW programs where I worked (two jobs for the first 6 months) and saved as much money as possible. I chose a well-regarded but affordable school for my MSW, paid for most of my tuition out of pocket, and am getting by with the rest of my savings. Even though I was able to swing a part-time job during my BSW, I didn't bother trying with grad school. After having completed my first semester, I definitely think I could probably manage working one or two days a week. Because of my good credit score, I am considering getting a credit card with 18 months of no interest if I'm not able to make ends meet until graduation this spring. I wouldn't advise the credit card unless you have a backup option to pay the balance on time if you aren't able to, which I am fortunate to have.

Best of luck to you. You're stronger than you know."

Sharkictus,TrueChristian,1388970268.0,"It can be really easily summed. You do something wrong, typically hurting someone, but there are plenty things that are agreed to be wrong but hurt no one.

You are made aware of your actions being wrong. If caught, you are to stop, apologize to your victims, sorry to society as a whole, and stop doing it. If not caught but still aware, you should stop, and apologize to any victim of any.

What about when you never stop, never ask for forgiveness, never even consider the wrong doing to be wrong (even with victims?)

And if you, your life get away with it, what justice is there?

Now every human being has a laundry list of things they have gotten away with, no?

God is just, the only just thing is hell, second death. Ultimate separation from God. Now how hell is interpreted is variable. 

You have pure annihalitiion, which is essentially that all unsaved people's afterlives are what the atheists describe life after death is, non existent. You cease to exist. (there are issues with this because Jesus does describe suffering for those who go to hell)

Another is that everyone sins is paid for, but it dependent on whether Jesus pays it, or the individual pays it. When the individual pays for his/her own sin, he burns, but they are one with their sin, so they burn until they are no more. Some unsaved burn longer than others. (This is what I believe). (Issues with this are that it depends on how inteprets the word eternal...whether or not the colloquial definition is what is meant...English is a langauge that constantly changes its words meaning and is language that often translates different meaning words into one whole general word, for example english word 'love' versus the bajillions different greek lingual concepts and words for love.) 

The most common belief is when one goes to hell, the individual, burns forevermore. (There is arguable issue of inconsistencies with certain penalties here, but considered a weak arguement). 

Could Jesus have everyone be saved? Well yes, but the triune God we believe decided not to. 

If you believe in predestination, God chose essentially random people to be saved for His glory. 

If you don't. you have to believe the will is no longer/never corrupted and that we all choose the way it will be. 

Or something in between...since God exists outside of space and time, so from an internal perspective it's our choice, and from an external it was kind of His or he automatically knew it because omniscience (all knowing)...Things get all sorts of wibbly when you have to remember God exists outside of time...

God didn't have to save anyone, it would be completely right for Him to just let us all burn. 

In His mercy, he lets us repent. However He himself notes the righteous path is the path less chosen."

Punishment needs to be severe enough to be an effective deterrent, but it can't be so severe that criminals will take desperate measures to avoid it, like killing a cop for instance.

15 years is long enough to be extremely unappealing bu it's also about as long as you can stay in prison before you no longer have a chance of a relatively normal life after release. Criminals need to know that going to jail won't be, for all intents and purposes, the end of their lives.

The tone of the letter, too, is very formal to the point of sounding stiff. Based on the contents of the letter, it sounds like the sender and recipient are around the same age and members of at least overlapping social circles, yet the author doesn't use a single contraction, favoring the forms you would see in a textbook, instead.

In general, there are a lot of places where こと could be replaced with の or worded differently altogether to sound more natural.

LolaRuns,Games,1388971499.0,"As a double Xer myself something about how Ninja Theory does their game writings (DMC, Enslaved, Heavenly Sword) totally screams (some) female sensibility to me. Like there must be a woman somewhere in their writing or production team or *something*. 

Havenly Sword, though I haven't played it supposedly had a very well rounded female main character. Enslaved, even though here the girl is mostly not playable and kinda has to be dragged along (kinda like it later got popular with Elizabeth and co) just screamed that they were still trying to write a unique character with her, give her her own personality, her own arc, rather than her being just this idealized two dimensional thing you drag around and who provides some eye candy or some awww moments. 

One would think that between Dante having a threesome with two hot chicks, the cussing, Kat's bootie shorts and the way the female villains are portrayed the game would be super anti-women, but I think the story still rings as being kinda girl friendly. Yeah, one could argue that Kat's only a non-playable damsel in distress, but she's actually fairly useful and in the end the plot sorta hinges on her. And something about her just rings as nice non annoying girl rather than sexy eye candy. (starting with that she actually shows comparatively little interest in Dante (other than looking at his junk) compared to how much interest he's showing her) You can totally read the foundations of a ""sexy bad boy who gives everything for the cute girl he meets"" story in there. 

Add to that that imo DMC Dante is one of the few examples of a game clearly playing up a male characters sex appeal in a girl friendly fashion. 

I actually used to wonder for a while whether that might be a reason why some people reacted so strongly negative to him because the way he is portrayed feels kinda different. (realistically, it's probably more that the game reads so obviously western)

And yeah the game is absolutely one I would recommend in a heart beat to any aspiring girl gamer. "

I haven't ever met a fat person, either in person or online, who wants to promote obesity or encourage other people to go out and get fat. That doesn't appear to be what they want. What they want is to be allowed to accept their own bodies and be happy and confident in their own skin without constantly being told that they're bad or wrong for being fat and happy at the same time. 

&gt;I'm hoping people can find a middle ground, between hiding because you and others verbally hate you for the way you look, and walking around going ""LOOK AT ME I'M HUGE AND IT'S GREAT!"".

I don't see why they need to - if they choose to not take steps to lose the weight, that's their business and nobody but their doctor has the right to tell them what they should do with their bodies. Is it healthy? Nope. Neither are a lot of choices that people make...even thin people make unhealthy choices and don't always eat right or get enough exercise. So what? That is the business of the individual. Their body, their choice. Fat people's bodies are not public property, nor are they up for public debate.

Bilgistic,AskReddit,1388972068.0,"Food isn't much of an issue. We already produce enough to provide 10 billion people, and developed countries in particular pay farmers to not grow any in order to maintain a certain price and not produce too much food.

In terms of lifestyle, the Earth would be overpopulated if everyone on the planet had a certain level of consumption, but we both know that this is far from the case.

That said, emissions are definitely an issue. That's one area in which we've seen rises every year and they're only getting faster and faster. This could be solved by pushing renewables as well as things like more efficient cars, though this has managed to become a political issue so we probably won't make anywhere near as much progress on this as we can.

In terms of overfishing, this is also an issue, but we've seen explosions in things like fish farming which are likely to be our saving grace here."

IAmNotAPerson6,AskReddit,1388972130.0,"&gt; Corporations, political parties and other special interest groups have learned how to put the power of Madison Avenue to work. Changing people's thoughts to align with a campaign has become commonplace (War on Terror, Global Warming, the gay rainbow, etc.). In many cases, people are voting against their own interests and doing it happily.

This has gone on for just about ever. I'll give you the fact that it's grown massively in the last century with the advent of the PR industry in the early 20th century though.

&gt; While some may have had fringe ideas 30 years ago, without the internet, they were isolated. Now the fringers can group together via social media. There's even an outright war against science itself going on...and science is losing badly.

I'll give you this one. Fringe groups coalescing is a lot easier now. But they're still *fringe* groups. And I don't know what the ""war against science"" has to do with that since that's being waged by the ""corporations, political parties and other special interest groups"" you previously mentioned.

&gt; The value of information itself has decreased, ironically because there's just too much of it to process.

This seems like 100% bullshit. How has the value of information decreased?

&gt; People are unwilling to give up the ""hate buzz."" Each time you get in an argument with someone on the internet (""Are you kidding me?""), you get a little hit of testosterone and it becomes addictive.

ToastyXD,gaymers,1388972186.0,"To sum up what is there:

We are thrown in medias res (in the middle of action) and introduced to our protagonist, Red Hot (or I shall call him Flame Boy), his friends are all misfits who have been rejected (minus Spooky) to be interns with adult super heroes. So they have created a search and rescue team under the command of Commander (ha...).

The whole plot so far is surrounding Flame Boy and Silver Fox (The Annihilator). With FB trying to come to terms with his sexuality, SF is portrayed that he is helping him and that he has interest in him; however, throughout the comic, you can see little bits of foreshadowing that shows SF has something else in mind. 

SF and The Platinum Priestess have plans set. There are little tiny hints that they are growing tired of getting old and want youth in some way that involves FB. Lulling FB into a false sense of trust, SF uses him as a key to open the portal to some hellish world to make a deal with a demon for his and PP's eternal youth and vitality, as well as the ruling of the Americas; however, for the price of allowing passage to Earth for the demon and his troops. 

We are left with the SF leaving his thoughts of how he should've treated FB better if it were a different time, but alas, it wasn't meant to be (hint hint, this might be me, but I think the ending = SF sacrificing himself to safe FB). FB calls his most trusty friends to come console him, and that is where we are left off at."

gazork_chumble_spuzz,BodyAcceptance,1388972237.0,"&gt;then why not focus on the photographer's work instead of posting photos of ONE model from MULTIPLE photographers?

That's a valid point - obviously, the person who gathered the photos and submitted them had an agenda that had nothing whatsoever to do with art critique. He was, demonstrably, a douchebag.

&gt;and, let's be honest, if they wanted to post genuine criticisms they could have contacted me or the photographers directly or posted in a space that was a friendly place for positive criticisms, not a sub that is specifically to say ""hur hur this aint art because i said so"".

That's true too. And yet, in the middle of all the ignorant haters, there were a couple of responses that were kind, and that offered some good advice regarding the photographer's technique. Even in a subreddit designed for people to judge, you occasionally find a decent post.

There was no information posted that would allow anyone who wanted to contact you directly to be able to do so. Your name, your blog, the names of whoever took the pics, the source of the photos - none of it was included cuz the OP felt like that would be too invasive (more likely he/she just didn't want to be found out!). 

&gt;so nope, i don't buy the ""genuinely wanted to offer constructive criticism of the art""

And for probably 99% of the comments there, that's true. I had never heard of that subreddit until today, but it looks horrible, like a conglomeration of small minds and egotism. 

I didn't realize that you were the model.  : )  I'm never sure, when links to blogs are posted, whether the submitter is the blogger or just a fan of the blog. I've seen your blog before and your pics, too - I always love your choice of hair colour. The bright orange is badass. "

Myuym,3d6,1388972323.0,"Alchemist isn't really magic right?

Anyway, I would go rogue probably. 
With the scout archetype at lvl 8 you'll do sneak attack if you are within 30 feet and move more then 10 feet. 

I would get the bushwacker archetype (kobold only) for the gunslinger to deal even more sneak attack added to that. 

Now since multiple archetypes are a thing, you could add the pistolero archetype also. 

Meaning at lvl 10 you could do a shot of 5d6 (rogue sneak) + 3d6 (pistolero ability cost 1 grit) + 1d6 (Bushwacker, need at least 1 grit) + 2d6 (bushwacker) + normal damage

And that is not that bad.

But you might want to look at what you want to play, not just something optimized. because it might not happen often and this might be just the opportunity to play characters that you want to play but can't create without gestalting.

LolaRuns,Games,1388972362.0,"I enjoyed this game. I thought that the wanna be tough guy dialog was hilariously bad at times, but I actually liked the story and characters. (even if they are unrealistic in a video game kind of way. Like Dante sure takes quickly to those people who he just met...) I didn't mind the shooting of the woman/female demon. It's one of the moments I kinda bought in a year which was filled with games trying to be try hard violent and gory. This one felt organic to that world. 

The changes to Dante's character, I can see why people consider them frustrating and don't like them, but in the game it was very clear why they did it for the benefit of their story (I would say so the temptation would be higher). Kinda sad that in the end it will probably prove useless since a sequel probably won't happen (when I have to admit, I would have been reasonably curious to see how this new, changed Dante, now with white hair, would take to his new role). 

I enjoyed the gameplay decently, I liked the level design with the various collectibles. It's one of the games that actually made me want to go back and try my hand on various levels with higher difficulty and with the new weapons. 

That said, it's stupid that they locked away the harder difficulties. I think a compromise could have been if the normal 3 had been unlocked + the hardest one and you have to unlock the ones in between. 

I also found the boss fights quite disappointing, in fact, particularly the last one where it seemed the boss's real super power was the power of cut scenes that ripped you out of any combo constantly. 

**IMO** the game rises and falls with Limbo and how great it looks. 

I do have a lot of sympathy with the fans of the old series and their argument that it should have been a new IP. That said, I feel I would have missed a lot of the components if they had been forced to take them out. There's just something that rings as really classic about them, even with the change to the background. "

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1388972890.0,"I'm more talking about the people who's primary method to deal with conflict is passive aggression, men like that can't look for conflict or act that way openly. There's all sorts of sociological reasons but in general people are more willing to simply distance themselves from such an individual and nobody likes to be alone, they learn to not seek out conflict. Women like that tend not to get distanced and thus they are able to continue to seek out conflict, they don't have that impetus to change the way they act. I want to understand what goes on in their minds to support that.

Honestly I've seen it more in women that always appear happy, they just sort of give off an air of hostility and anger. There aren't many of them but it's kind of clear, just as it's clear when somebody's always looking for a fight or an argument.

There are differences between people but the same general behavior tends to be rooted in specific traits, those traits can differ between the sexes because cultural expectations are different. I make use of knowledge of individuals to figure out the general, I want more data points and this is one of the few things that I don't have much on but think will be useful later.

The problem is that I have a different sort of empathy (in addition to that), I learned to act and word things in a way that keeps others calm so that I don't need to work as hard to remain calm myself. Best case scenario, I'd figure out a way to filter all that out and actually know what's internal and what's external but that's really unlikely.

As I said, I was barely awake and worded it poorly. Of course if I were asking about some trait about any other group I'd probably ask it the same way, I assume that people asking questions are simplifying their wording and I have a tendency to assume others do the same.

It should have been ""Why are women who tend to act catty that way the majority of the time?"" Now that I've given more thought to it I guess I'm really asking ""Why do conflict seeking women tend towards being overt in their desire to get into fights and why does nobody seem to respond to them the same way they would a man who does the same?""

That was in reference to things that could simply be worded poorly, I assume the best but prepare for the worst (basically I politely ask the person to expand on their statement or question). Keeps a lot of arguments from starting.

I know all I need to about the way a troll's mind works, if avoiding starting trouble when I can keeps trolls from interacting with me and makes troll bait stay away from places I frequent then all the better. Trolls want to piss others off, pissing them off keeps others calm, and troll bait is getting to get pissed off at something anyway so way bother caring. Keeping calm and trying to be kind has worked out pretty well for me, it's gotten me some renown in two subs (which lead to me becoming a mod in one) and infamy in another which is populated by trolls and people so insane that the trolls don't even need to do anything to watch people rage (you know that one kid in school who thought everybody loved them but was overtly detested, that's basically what the sub was)."

risto1116,GNV,1388972944.0,"**If you're looking for a job in Gainesville**

*  **The mall** is going to be practically impossible and likely waste your time. Most places in there are laying off their seasonal workers, so they don't need more people applying. You're free to apply, but don't expect to hear back.

*  **Craigslist** has a few places hiring, but be warned: if you see a job constantly opening every few weeks, it likely sucks to work at. My girlfriend learned this the hard way.

*  If you're serious about wanting a job, apply at **Moe's, Panda Express, McDonald's, Smoothie Planet, etc.** I hate when people say ""I'm desperate for a job!"" but refuse to work fast food. It's not demeaning work. It's part-time and it pays the bills. These places are always hiring. If you need a job, you could get one in 3 days by applying to 6 or 7 food places.

* You can check **[UF Jobs](https://jobs.ufl.edu/)**, but (in my personal experience) they often pay less than fast food/retail jobs, and some of the places suck to work at. Again, just my experience, I'm sure some places there are wonderful. Any of the higher paying one require you to be a graduate and most at-least require you to be enrolled at UF.

*  Apply at the strip malls. Go to Butler Plaza, start at Best Buy and go North. **Best Buy, Petsmart, ROSS (which I know is hiring), Party Store, Michael's (I know is hiring too), Office Max, Pier 1, ReTech, Sports Store, 4R Smokehouse...** etc. The list goes on. It's a big place, lots of retail jobs available.

Back when I was struggling for money, I found NO trouble at landing a job in this town. Most of my friends that complain about it typically apply at 2-3 places then wait to hear anything. 

**Don't do that!**

If you NEED a job, you spend 4-5 hours going to 12-15 places in a day and fill out applications till your hand cramps. You do this for a few days. You get 3-4 interviews and you take the job you think is the best fit. That strategy has worked incredibly well for me and I bet it will work for 90% of people if they apply themselves (pun intended)."

&gt;Not necessarily. In fact, many clones have slight variations in coat color and markings.

&gt;Let’s think about the identical twin calves again. They have the same genes, but look a little different. That’s because of the way those genes are expressed—that is, how the information in that gene is seen in the actual animal. For example, if they’re Holstein cows, the pattern of their spots, or the shape of their ears may be different. Human identical twins also have the same genes, but because those genes are expressed differently in each person, they have different freckle and fingerprint patterns."

pinkfu,loseit,1388973002.0,"&gt; All love is possessive. 

I wholly disagree. I love, I am loved. None of it includes a drop of possession. Possession is a sign of malignancy. 

&gt;  Love Itself is the ultimate transgression of boundaries

What? Does this mean love transgresses personal boundaries? Does it mean love requires zero personal boundaries until all those involved in the relationship are functioning as a single entity? Does it mean that love has no boundaries? 

Personal boundaries and the respect of those boundaries are the essential foundation to emotional and mental health both individually and within relationships. There isn't a lot of room for argument on this point but if you insist, please provide sources because I'm really not going to bother with it much further without getting in to actual data. 

&gt; because only Love speaks the words, ""Everything About You Is About Me, Too.""

I don't understand this mentality at all. It doesn't reflect reality as I know it, or as I have witnessed in any real, functional, healthy, long term relationship. Like, ever. Especially among couples married 50+ years (and my pool of experience is larger than most.)

&gt; Hence psychotherapy: that sweet and sacred space where people learn about issues like ""self-esteem,"" and ""personal space,"" and finally discover how to ""be their true self.""

What in the actual fuck...? I am so not going in to the wild world of ""psychotherapy"" here and this sentences is baffling in general.

&gt; If I wear a ring on my finger, it's because I belong to you, and submit to you with deep joy. If I seek to fulfill your desires it's because seeking your pleasure returns my own.

Clearly you subscribe to the romantic ""epic"" ideal. Watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKSqXGZJKbk

This particular subject (love as defined by romance ""epic"" ideals) is so common that I am just starting people with this video. It's endlessly tiring to go through this basic concept and that video at least cuts through some of the BS in a humorous way.

Personally, I find this kind of ""love"" ideal trite and limiting. Soul mates, two become one, blah blah. Shallow as puddles on a coin. It's a bit like the difference between staring at the sky through old opera glasses from a rooftop in NYC vs the hubble telescope. It really troubles me that what is idealized and pushed so often by media and twisted cultural bullshit is so dim and lame. 

If you feel the romance epic ideal is the more comfortable option for you, if you find yourself really conflicted or angry at my opinion or the video, I suggest talking to a professional in person about your thoughts. Yeah, it's kinda fucked up but at this point the investment I require to give up that kind of energy is not possible to satisfy here. I've reached the point in this thread where I am repeating myself (see other comments) and bored. 

Food for thought (I am not expecting or desiring actual answers from you or anyone else): Can you love more than once in a lifetime? Can you love more than one person at a time? Can you love your family and a spouse/SO at the same time? Is the love between a spouse and a family member, friend, or a child significantly different in some way? If so, what exactly are those differences? Is love a finite resource? Does romantic love require sex? What happens to romantic love when sex, previously a part of the relationship, is no longer involved due to age, illness, or other new factors? How do the answers to these questions support or conflict with your definition and understanding of love? "

theidleidol,pics,1388973014.0,"There probably are people who put as much effort into practicing Pastafarianism as many Christians put into their faith or many Jews put into theirs. If the beliefs and practice of Pastafarianism are too vague or ""silly"" to be considered protectable as a religion, what about other religions?

I've seen men in top-hat-ish headwear with curly sideburns blow a goat(?) horn at people by way of blessing. I've eaten a thin, tasteless cracker that I was supposed to believe was actually 100% the real body of Jesus. I've moved my stuff out of the way so a Muslim man could get his prayer rug pointed just the right direction in a cramped room. I've been late to events because I got stuck behind an Amish buggy. 

I think all of those practices are rather silly, but I'm not going to pass judgement on the validity of the religion they belong to; at least certainly not in a legal capacity. I won't even condemn Scientology (the religion) despite the seemingly epic corruption of Scientology (the church/organization).

The whole point of Pastafarianism is to demonstrate the ideal of separation of church and state. Religion shouldn't have an effect on or be affected by the workings of the government. What religious object someone chooses to swear an oath on should not matter, as long as it is significant to them.

Willravel,startrek,1388973636.0,"The real miracle of Star Trek is that *The Motion Picture* was made. Originally, *TOS* only had a very select audience, a small but deeply devoted fan base. After it went off the air, it was repeated for years, allowing the audience to slowly but surely grow. Between that and *TAS*, eventually it was felt that a gamble on a movie would be worth a shot. Once *The Motion Picture* and *Wrath of Khan* solidified Trek as a cinema force, then we had a series of movies, which allowed for the perfect environment for *TNG*. 

At it's end on television, *TNG* had been poised to make the move back to movies, taking the place of the *TOS* crew, so that Trek could make more money for it's owners. *TNG* ended with smash ratings, fans starved for more, with the promise that movies were soon to come, creating fantastic buzz and anticipation. *Generations* wasn't super successful (like *TMP*), but *First Contact* was a smash among fans and casual moviegoers alike. 

*DS9* was a wholly different endeavor. While Picard and his crew were in the process of moving to the silver screen, *DS9* was playing out like a war drama for more hard-core Trek fans. Despite general consensus now being that the writing on *DS9* was amazing in the later years, it failed to draw the ratings numbers *TNG* pulled, so *DS9* was treated like what it was: Star Trek for TV. The ratings at the end of *DS9* were more than disappointing, pointing to a shift which would plague *Voyager* and *Enterprise* away from episodic television and towards multi-episode arcs. Ironically, *DS9* was way ahead of its time in adopting the arc structure, and had it been on the air 10 years later probably would have benefitted from arcs instead of seeing lower ratings (with the popularity of renting or buying whole seasons on DVD, eventually to be replaced by DVR and Netflix). 

From a story and character perspective, it would have been amazing. From a business perspective? It was impossible. "

blastfromtheblue,AskReddit,1388974400.0,"the macbook air is specced at 1.3GHz, mine is 2.5GHz. not quite twice as fast, but close enough. you could pay extra on the macbook air for a faster processor, but i could have as well and had a pretty cool i7.

edit: oh, and on the price i paid for mine, i have a 128GB SSD. i also did a ram upgrade on mine later, which was pretty easy to do given that it's not a macbook. :o) i did a ton of research before buying this laptop. i paid a bit of a premium for build quality as well as performance.

what i was getting at is that for the same price as a tablet + a laptop, you could have one device that is both those things. this one device is powerful enough for most things (competitive with similarly priced laptops) that the average user needs.

because it is a laptop, it is strictly better than a laptop. because it is also tablet, is is nearly strictly better than any tablet (the one caveat is that the app store for windows is not quite as extensive yet as the other two). and finally, it is at most as expensive as a tablet + a laptop.

i'm telling you that if you have around $1000 and want a new laptop and a new tablet, i would hazard that the majority of people would be better off buying a windows 8.1 laptop/tablet.

i also never quite understood the appeal of smaller tablets. from what i understand, they are (or were originally) marketed towards people who want a tablet but can't justify the expense. in which case, the windows 8.1 laptop/tablet kind of solves that issue as well, since you can essentially get a full tablet for free with your laptop.

i'm not saying that windows 8.1 devices are the perfect solution to everything, but they are a versatile, powerful, and cost-effective solution to a ton of things."

irondal2,casualiama,1388974450.0,"Yeah, but are you a medical doctor? “Mental health work” is a broad classification which can mean anything from nursing mentally ill patients to licensed practice of psychology (if you don’t practice psychiatry). Are you a MD who specializes in psychiatry? Good for you, if you are, that means you know more about organic chemistry than I do, and you prescribe medication to patients who really need that kind of treatment. Sociopaths aren’t typically the kind of patients who need medication.

Sociopaths benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy more than sociopaths benefit from interaction with psychiatrists. The reason a hospital like your workplace probably doesn’t provide CBT to many sociopaths is because sociopaths hardly ever seek such treatment. In fact, most sociopaths who do receive treatment are recidivists, and these offenders receive treatment in a prison facility, not in a psych ward. One isn’t simply “committed” to an inpatient mental health center for antisocial behavior, because to do so would violate the patient’s rights. On top of that, a sociopath can mask their illness from friends, colleagues, and family members’ knowledge, and can evade law enforcement detection.

You didn't post a page number, so I can't read the exact percentages of male and female sociopaths (that's what I asked OP to cite), but it doesn't matter. Here, I’ll supply a link to the National Institute of Health’s encyclopedia entry for the [antisocial personality disorder](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001919/) you mentioned in your comment. I see that supposedly ”more men than women are affected” (with ASPD) and I see the “condition is common among people who are in prison” (both at the end of the paragraph under the “Causes, incidence, and risk factors” heading). This information is well-known and is nothing I haven’t already read. Like I wrote, I wanted a citation for the percentages, which have come from studies, that I can look for in journal(s) to see the studies’ population sampling demographics. This information did not come from a psychiatric hospital setting."

""If you make a report of alleged animal cruelty, the responding agency is required to investigate. Dialing 911 is the quickest route to get a response, but it is also useful to have the proper animal welfare agency's number on hand.

If you're traveling or live in a community without an animal welfare agency, call the local police department (or 911) to report suspected animal abuse.

If your area lacks the proper animal welfare agency, and your local authorities are not equipped to deal with animal cruelty cases, you can also email or call The HSUS and ask to speak with one of our experts about the suspected abuse.""

I know how that goes. I went through that with one of my closest friends, he apparently has a habit of acting like a complete ass towards people after he's known them for awhile, I think there are some issues there but I really don't know. I was going through some shit so in a way I kind of rationalized his behavior, I thought I deserved it and in a way I think it helped me (kind of a detox of sorts from what had been going on before, it let me ease into things and get used to just dealing with the pain I had instead of always knowing that more was waiting). He wised up towards the end of the school year, things got better.

I also understand this sort of thing, thankfully not personally. I was actually looking the reasoning behind having these sorts of relationships when they aren't forced. Why people have frenemies (however you spell it, it's an idiotic concept).

I'm with you here as well, problem is there's never benefit for me. I'm always putting on an act, always. I just can't let it slip for a second, I have no idea why. Maybe I'm scared that if I do then I won't be able to get it back, maybe I won't want to, maybe there's nothing left behind it or at least not enough to really be a person, maybe I'm just scared to find out. I don't know. It wears me down, I pick my friends based partially on who's easiest to be around. Who projects the least so I can feel more without needing to worry that what I'm feeling is somebody else's emotions. Who lets me put on the simplest masks so I don't need to work quite as hard to stay in character. Who understands me best when I just can't seem to translate my thoughts. Who cares the least when I can't keep my thoughts to myself, when I can't sugarcoat every syllable. Who makes me feel the most human. It's funny, when I was young all I wanted was to seem like everybody else and be treated the same as them but now all I want is somebody who'll accept me for who I am, not who I pretend to be. What I did to try to avoid being alone has made more even more so, sometimes you just can't win."

Obviously you can each do this for your individual interests as well, but you seemed to want something to do together as a couple. This can also include things like open mic nights if you're into music/poetry/comedy.

2. See if there's a group for your neighborhood/block. Try getting to know some of the people living around you.

3. Volunteer somewhere for a little while, and you'll get to know the other volunteers. They'll probably be the outgoing type, and depending on what you pick you might find people with something in common. For example, if you like pets, volunteer at an animal shelter or maybe even a zoo. If you want to help the needy, volunteer at a food pantry, a homeless shelter, a charity, etc. If you like reading, volunteer at a library. You get the idea. Find a good cause you'd enjoy supporting.

4. If you're religious, find a church you like and find a group there. If you're not religious, maybe look for a skeptic/atheist/agnostic/humanist group if you're into that sort of thing.

5. Do a Google search for: how to make friends. Also maybe visit /r/socialskills and /r/makingfriends "

vivichase,gradadmissions,1388975751.0,"&gt; And really it is part of the interview to stay with someone. There were some local people who didn't do this, but I don't think any out of town people got hotels. Getting a hotel might make you stand out in a bad way  

You sound awesome, can I stay with you?  Haha!  You really hit the nail on the head regarding the core dilemma I'm having.  Most of the other comments are regarding ""incriminating"" behavior at grad student houses, but I'm not worried about that at all.  I am confident that I can be a considerate and gracious guest, since I understand how much of a hassle it can be to lodge a stranger for 1 - 2 nights.  Besides, I'm Canadian!  Good manners is practically federal law.  

The hotel recommended to us is literally minutes away from campus, so it's not necessarily the logistics that I'm worried about.  My main concern is how choosing to stay at a hotel may be perceived.  The graduate student who's organizing the itinerary mentioned that she will be arranging a group hotel rate, but I was informed as of this morning that I've been the only student to contact her.  This worries me, as it indicates that choosing a hotel is far outside the norm.

Perhaps I'm overthinking this, but this is my top choice program so I really need to make a good impression.  We're being paired with a current student ""buddy"" as well, and I plan on communicating with her regarding our (hopefully) soon-to-be shared advisor.  Would you feel that this would be sufficient in lieu of staying with a student?  "

Dascuff1,magicTCG,1388975788.0," - standard: People are annoyed because of the high cumulative cost of playing. To play it competitively for any amount of time beyond a single year you will end up spending hundreds of dollars which will then plummet in value once they rotate. Yes obviously you can build decks and do upkeep on them for cheap but lets face it those aren't going to be tier 1 decks that top 8 a GP anytime soon.

 - modern: People are annoyed with the high price of certain staples, the most prominent example is the fetches. Also some legacy players hold some animosity towards the format since it kinda signifies a loss of wotc's support for legacy bringing in modern to more or less take over as the non-rotating format. There is also a fairly decent amount of people who don't really care for the ban list.

 - legacy: The entrance cost is incredibly high. Unless you have a grand or so laying around for just the lands needed for a single deck the average player probably doesn't have the funds to play. The lack of support to the format is fairly annoying for most. The restricted list and the idea (aka more or less fact) that other staples of the format won't be seeing a reprint pretty much ever.

Fimbultyr,AskMen,1388975900.0,"That's really unfair to expect transpeople to have to out themselves basically from the moment someone shows a little interest. Say a woman had a really unappealing looking vagina, just so god damn ugly that 90% of men would do a complete 180 and leave in the middle of a hookup over it. Would you expect her to tell every guy who flirted with her about it? Obviously you bring it up at some point, but no one's bringing it up immediately. You can't expect someone to divulge really personal information like that to a stranger just in case it might make someone feel icky later."

sam_hammich,AdviceAnimals,1388975902.0,"A tale of honor?  Of bravery?  I'm sorry, I have none.  Only horror.. subjugation.  Despair.  I still hear it in my sleep, you know..  the squishing.  We heard it all the time in the tomato mines.  The sickening squelch of freshly-mined tomatoes mingling with the skin-crawling slither of the spaghetti overseers.  You see, I was a pasta-smith, once.  In my younger years.  But one day I was making dinner.. I was measuring the spaghetti, as one does.  I don't know what I was thinking.  It just..  didn't look like enough.  So I put in more..  and more..  I don't remember how much.  When everything was over, there was enough for the mass of noodles to gain sentience.  And that's when The Uprising began.  They wiggled and wormed through the streets, taking men, women, children.. all you could hear were the screams.  Put us to work mining tomatoes.  Never told us why.  My wife Claudia and I, we mined the heirlooms.  Strange thing, heirloom tomatoes.  They're oddly beautiful; the shapes and colors, all different.  Every one we chipped free from the earth was like a treasure.  Claudia..  they caught her putting one in her pocket.  Strung her up on linguine.  Not a day goes by that I don't miss her terribly.  How foolish she was..

How did I escape?  Oh, it's been so long.. but I still remember it like it was yesterday.  I heard a shifting in the earth behind an especially big tomato that I had dug out of a sheer cliff face.  Squeezing myself into the opening I came upon a grotto with a small underground stream.  Barely a trickle, but enough to sate my thirst.  I made my home there, must have been months.  Couldn't tell for sure.  I listened for the noodley whips of the spaghetti overlords every day, to know when I could make my escape, but they were always there.  Always watching.  So I decided to dig up.  Up, up through the cold ground.  I only stopped to graze on tiny clumps of cherry tomatoes as I made my way up to what I had desperately hoped was the sun I hadn't seen for what seemed like eons.  Eventually I broke through to the surface..  and saw the sun.  Oh, it was beautiful, my friend.. the most beautiful thing I'd seen since the last day I saw dear Claudia.  I wept.  I wept and ran, ran for my life..  and I've been running ever since."

darkestsideofthemoon,Switzerland,1388975939.0,"Okay, having applied to a fair bunch of universities, I feel relatively qualified to help you out here.

1) That's cool.

2) 3/4 is relatively alright - but don't worry, not too much weightage on scores. More about meeting the requirement.

3) Highlight this both in CV and Motivation

4) WRITE TO THE ADMINISTRATION.

If there's one thing you should know about switzerland, it's that no one will tell you anything - unless you ask. 

Ignorance is not a defence in this country, and they take this extremely seriously. If you do not know something, it is because you did not bother to.

Write to them, and ask them if they will allow you take these courses as supplementary courses - maybe spend a semester before your actual masters to take them and a basic german level course - if you've got the time that is.

5) If you'd like to do your Masters here, I'm getting the feeling you'd like to work here. So German is going to become essential and some point.

6) The GRE.

If you're going to do stats, I'd suggest you ace the GRE - i.e. at least &gt; 161. Ideally 165 and above. (out of 170). This will be hugely in your favour.

Note: Unlike the U.S. or even the U.K. - Universities in Europe tend to accept you if you ""meet"" the requirements, regardless of your grade. This is because the workload will automatically weed out anyone not cut out for the programme.

I wish you the best of luck mate. And if you're around this time next year, give me a shout out and we'll grab beer.

Like hotdog says below,

7) Finances. I'd set aside at least 1000 - 1200 a month on expenses. And that's on a budget. If you're living ""normally"" I'd say that would even come to 1600 - 1800 a month. CHF.

A decent room in zurich costs about 550 - 650 a month, and if you're looking for a studio, 700 onwards.

Qwerty is designed so that keys commonly typed together won't hit each other on a typewriter (so they're often typed with opposite hands). Dvorak is designed so that commonly trumped letters are in the home row and *above*. There is some evidence that Dvorak reduces RSIs, but that speed gains are negligible.

Also, the Mac OS has something called the DQ layout, or Dvorak but with qwerty shortcut keys (so when you do ctrl-V, it's in the regular qwerty location). Sadly, I discovered that after I was used to the new placement of shortcut keys.  "

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1388977242.0,"Have you been having transmission problems before this? Or any problems at all? Is the check engine light on?

Have you checked the transmission fluid to see if it's low? Smell it and see if it's burnt.

It sounds like it has low fluid, but driving a transmission with low fluid or that has the symptoms you have, even for a few miles, can cause detrimental problems to the transmission. If you ever have to press the gas pedal to get the car to move, you have a problem. A car should just move naturally in idle once it's in gear and your foot is off the brake. 

I'm just assuming, but are you having to give the car a lot of gas and run up the RPMs to even get it to move, or no?

When the car lunges furiously, it never actually shifts? You definitely have a transmission problem. I hope you haven't driven it any further and left it parked until you can get it looked at?

Tow it to a transmission shop. Not a general mechanic. Most mechanics know hardly anything about transmissions. You can call your mechanic and ask him if he does know about transmissions and work on them, but he may not. Find a reputable transmission shop.

It's not going to be a simple fix like bad transmission fluid. Don't let anyone sell you on a transmission flush and tell you that it's going to fix it. You need someone who knows transmissions, can scan it for codes, and then get it up in the air on a lift and take the pan down to see if there's any metal in the pan, fluid degradation or anything else that indicates major transmission failure.

Without actually being there to diagnose in person, that's the best advice that can be given to you. You just likely need another transmission."

Now, my Mum doesn't really know two much about cars, so she trusts the managers to help her do whats right. It would appear that the really don't give two shits.

Optimus Prius uses fully synthetic 0W20 year round. That is the one and only weight listed in the service manual. It also says synthetic 5W20 can be used in a pinch but must be switched to 0W20 at the next oil change.

I'm back home for a week and I looked though her service invoices. Many of the invoices do not list the oil used (but judging from the price, it was conventional, and definitely not 0W20) but on the latest one lists 5W20 conventional.

Like, come on. It's not like they don't have the ability to look it up. I used to work at a Canadian Tire I could look up what oil, filter, and the wheel nut torques of a Lamborghini Gallardo used. There's no excuse for not putting the right oil in.

redpandabear,AskWomen,1388978904.0,"I still see a therapist when I need to, and I lucked out in finding the perfect one right off the bat. In my situation, I knew I had to talk to a man, and male therapists are extremely rare in my area. I've been seeing him on and off for about 7 years now.

And yes, it has definitely helped. I used to have horrendous nightmares 3+ times per week; last year I can only recall having 2-3 the entire 12 months, and they have overall become far less graphic. While I still struggle with some anxiety, I'm able to handle it much better in most cases.

But--and this is important--therapy only works *if you're willing to make it work*. The first 6 months I was in, it didn't do much for me, because I was resistant to the idea in the first place. It wasn't until I decided I was *going to get better, damn it,* that I actually put real time, effort, and sincerity into my therapy. The process has gone much smoother and has had far better results since.

Don't be afraid to shop around for one, too. An ideal therapist will work with you, will **not** belittle you or your problems, and guide you in the manner most comfortable for *you*. Remember: the therapy is about *your* health. If you feel your therapist doesn't care, drop that one and find another. It's so, so much easier to trust and confide in someone who genuinely cares about your well-being."

Whether that says just as much about the height of the bar we're setting for high school teachers I'll leave for you to decide, but it's crazy to think that, were it not for want of a Bachelor's, I could have been credentialed as a high school math teacher at age 19 and avoid the ""crippling debt"" that comes with college these days.

AwesomeLandia,teaching,1388980006.0,"Some posters I have up only at the beginning of the year, then I put them aside to pull out only when we need refreshers.  The important ones (the rules, being an active listener, etc.) stay up all year long.  The main part is to **explicitly teach the procedures and rules to your students** (even in high school).  I find having a poster is helpful because you can refer back to it and kids can look at it when they forget the procedure.  

If you're teaching middle school or lower grades, it can be fun to practice the procedures and have student volunteers act in a negative way (allow the class to yell out ""boo"") and act it out correctly.  Give stickers and/or verbal praise to the volunteers for their acting skills.  The kids will all love the ""bad"" actor and will remember the rule for a long time.  

I've been told to limit the amount of explicit rule and procedure teaching in my classroom to 1-3 per day, with reviews as needed.  Some teachers I know have little pop quizzes on the rules and procedures during their first week of class, and this is all they teach (along with the grading policy and an overview of the class) for that week.

AsherMaximum,Breadit,1388980160.0,"The last of the bread from last week on the left, new loaf from tonight on the right. I'll upload a crumb pic tomorrow when I cut it.

Both were the same [recipe](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/22464/white-sandwich-loaf) (Only modification I make to the recipe linked is to use 2.5x the amount of butter).  
Also the same amount of dough, and almost the same baking process:

Baking: 
 
 * Preheat oven to 500°, and place pan of water on lower shelf and pizza stone on middle shelf.
 * Place loaves on baking stone, spray the sides of the oven walls with water, close oven. Spray 2x more, waiting 30s between each.
 * Lower temp to 450°, bake 15 minutes.
 * Remove pan of water, lower to 375°, bake 25 minutes.
 * Remove loaves from pan, bake 10 minutes more.  

I did the above exactly the same this week and last.

Where I changed things:

 * Last week I did a milk wash, this week I melted 1 Tbsp butter and brushed that on (both after scoring).
 * Last week I did a crosshatch scoring, this week down the middle. I usually do a diagonal score instead of the crosshatch; last week's loaves sprang as much as they do with just a diagonal score though. I've done 2 loaves in the past, and diagonally scored one, and scored the other down the middle, and they both sprang the same. So, I don't think that is what caused it.
 * Last week, like usual, I did two loaves. This week I only did one. Both pans fit on my pizza stone without hanging over, but there isn't much room left. I'm wondering if maybe the single loaf in the middle of the stone got more heat on the sides, which made it spring more?
 * Both this week and last I used a mixer to knead. Last week I kneaded for 5 minutes, rest for 5, and the kneaded until it passed the windowpane test. This week the rest was closer to 20 minutes because I got distracted.

I've been making this recipe for awhile, and it always rises about as much as the one from last week, so I'm really curious to know what caused the extra rise this week. The only other time it rose anywhere near this much was when I was on vacation, and I did 4 loaves instead of 2, and didn't have a pizza stone. Everything else was the same that time too (as last week, not this week).

Really hoping someone can give me an idea of what I did right this week, so I can replicate it in the future!"

FreyjaSunshine,medicine,1388980407.0,"I think it is foolish to do both the sedation and the surgery.

I do not think dentists should give anything more than anxiolysis.

In 23 years, I've seen a lot of things pop up unexpectedly with anesthesia.  Shit happens, and if you've had years of anesthesia training and experience, you can handle those things.  Are dentists truly prepared to treat arrhythmias or airway problems?  Malignant hypertension or severe hypotension?  Or do they not even know that these things are happening because they don't monitor the patient closely enough?  I don't know, and I'm not willing to take that chance.

I wouldn't allow a dentist to sedate me or my family.  My daughter had an anesthesiologist anesthetize her for her wisdom teeth extractions.  

During the 5 months of anesthesia training, OMFS get the basics, but they are given the easiest of cases (at least that is how it was during my residency).  We don't send anesthesia residents out on their own after 5 months of training.  What makes OMFS so much more capable that they can give anesthesia with such a brief and modified training?"

However, should there be an exception for exposing one's breast while feeding a baby? This action can be adequately completed discreetly with relative ease. It's not as if the overt public display of breasts were necessary to feed a baby. 

If exposing ones breast while feeding a baby were socially acceptable, what is to be made of publicly exposing ones breast to sun tan? Or to swim with ease? Or to cool down while mowing your lawn on a hot day? There are plenty of valid reasons to expose one's breasts. 

If anything, feeding a baby, which involves the messy exchange of bodily fluids should considered more not less taboo than merely exposing one's breast. "

Once you get your skills up and a padded wallet to fly with some bling you are always welcome over at ISN (info below).

(for others looking to get in) For those of you who have a good 2b to drop on a ship (and can fit T2 guns) then I would suggest you heading over to ISN (Incursion Shiny Network) found at ""ISN Secondary"" or our website http://www.eve-isn.com/.  All of our fits can be found there and if you have any questions feel free to ask either here, a pm, or on Eve under the same character name.

If we were in the same position you are though, I think we would discuss testing with our doctor to see how/if that particular problem could be identified and consider doing that testing.  Not because we would consider terminating, but because it helps to begin appropriate care at birth if you know already that something is happening.

AwesomeLandia,teaching,1388981104.0,"Some staff resources for you to consider, in order to survive this year:  
* Your union rep (you should have at least one at your site)
* Your BTSA support provider (I'm not sure if this is all states, but CA has it).  
* Your department chair
* The school counselor(s)

Tell them what is going on and ask for strategies.  Ask your administrators to sub your class for a day so you can observe other teachers who are having success.  Ask for PD on classroom management, and use it to fill your bucket for next year (and get a day or two away from your classroom).  Ask the other staff if you can send a misbehaving student on a ""time out"" for part or all of the period (always send them with work) so you can have a more manageable group and not have to deal with admin.  

Be honest with your admin about how you're feeling about this school and your year so far.  Likely, s/he will want you to stay and will make an effort to support you better (unless s/he is a complete tool).  

Other tips:  Take a mental health day just for yourself.  Give yourself a night off and don't take home any grading or lesson planning.

gooeyfishus,AskReddit,1388981843.0,"Long distance relationships are tough. The usually fail because you don't have a strong base to fall back on to, and there is a lack of mutual trust/communication. So you have to make sure that you can trust the person you're with, they trust you and you communicate with them.

The downfall of a LDR starts when the seed of doubt gets planted in one of your minds. Your partner mentions off hand that she saw an old boyfriend last night at the party she went to, and in your mind, however irrational it is, you start to worry about that. How do you combat that? Well you have to know your partner well, and talk about that seed of doubt. You'll rest easier knowing that he's an ex because say, he was an abusive coke head (example). So you have to trust them.

And you have to communicate! When you have that question, the nagging feeling you need to speak up! Say ""hey, I'm feeling XYZ. Talk me through this. What's going on with this situation."" Actually tell your partner your feelings (GASP!) and discuss theirs as well. 
This goes for all relationships.

I would also suggest making an effort to see your partner on a regular basis if at all possible. Even if it's just once a month for a weekend, it gives you both something to look forward to. You can plan it, discuss it and use it a touchstone. Frequent conversations via skype is good.
 Hierarchy of conversation: Face-to-Face &gt; Skype/Video Chat &gt; Phone Call &gt; Text/Facebook. Utilize the highest hierarchy you can at all times.

LDR is difficult. I don't know how young you are, what your circumstances are etc. But unless you're already married to this person, you have a kid with them or have been with them for awhile and this is a temporary thing, I'd say it's not worth your while.

There is a big difference between an LDR forced on by a 6 month work move and an LDR based on the two weeks you spent over winter break with a chick. Which are you? And is it worth it (honestly)"

If you are a group that consistently is on BOCA, Voices Only, getting CARA nominations, getting positive RARB reviews, etc., you will sell decently well among the a cappella community, as long as you hype your product (product being both album and group) properly and market well. That said, collegiate a cappella albums are typically not huge money makers to begin with, and are generally a break-even venture, at best. Where albums are most valuable are in the recognition you receive from the community, serving as a marketing tool for your group, and as something to commemorate your time in the group (the purpose can be any or all of these, or even some other purpose, completely depending on what the goals of the album are)."
gingerkid1234,Christianity,1388981932.0,"&gt;How does it make any difference that they were written in Greek rather than Hebrew? 

I think so.  Hebrew and Aramaic are the languages of Jewish scholarship and tradition.  When a text is written in another language, it really can't intermingle with other texts to the same extent.  The Talmud quotes freely texts in Hebrew and Aramaic, which continues in later texts.  Texts not in one of those two languages (mostly Hebrew) generally don't make it into the Jewish literary canon except in translation.  No one reads or quotes *emunot ve-deot* or *moreh nevuchim* in their original Judeo-Arabic, because it's not the language of the Jewish community as a whole--everyone uses the Hebrew translation.  Case in point, there are tons of great English books about Judaism being written right now, but none have made it into the Jewish law ""canon"" of sorts, whereas several Hebrew texts and commentaries have (Yabia Omer, Igrot Moshe, Tzitz Eliezer, Kehati's Mishnah commentary, etc).  That's true even of American Rabbis--Igrot Moshe was written in New York.

&gt;Palestine was a Hellenized region. Most people probably communicated in Greek and Aramaic rather than Hebrew in the latter centuries B.C.E.. It makes sense that they'd be using religious texts in Greek, a language more people likely understood.

Kinda-sorta.  The upper class was, but most of the population was Aramaic speaking, with a smattering of Hebrew speakers.  While the Jewish community in Alexandria was Greek-speaking, in Judea things seem to have been in Aramaic.  The Jewish liturgy during the period is written entirely in Hebrew, for instance.  While Greek got used for formal things (funerary inscriptions is one thing), I don't think there's much reason to think it was a language of communication in the late BCEs.  Actually, I'd argue that the date where Judean native Greek-speakers outnumbered native Hebrew-speakers was close to the BCE/CE divide."

Neebat,funny,1388981984.0,"There are a few basic concepts in calculus.

MavinGreen has nailed the most important one.  Derivatives are slopes, or rate of change.  It gets a bit more interesting when you're dealing with a surface in 3 dimensions, but that's just details.

Derivatives are treated as a special case of limits.  You spend some time asking, ""What happens when we plug tiny numbers into a formula that won't take zero?""  The answer, usually is it explodes, but not always, and slopes are a great example.  The formula for a slope is change in Y over change in X, and if you take really small changes, the answer frequently comes out to a very reasonable number.  (You can also play with the idea of plugging in bigger and bigger numbers to see if that gets you somewhere.)

The other end of Calculus is the integral, which is just a backwards derivative.  If you remember when you started learning division, they would say, ""What do you multiple times 5 to get 30?""  Integrals are the same thing applied to derivatives.  ""Where have we seen something like this formula show up as a derivative?""  They're handy when you know the rate that something is changing (like acceleration) and trying to figure out how far it's going to get.

Limits are kind of the fundamental building block that gives you lots of exciting, useful math.  A lot of the math in physics comes out of calculus.  Also, some important formulas in business come out of calculus, and I spent a whole lot of time tutoring that, because business majors didn't expect to be doing abstract math."

She's jealous because you and Matt are now the center of attention. She got married, then she was the newlywed--now she's the old married one and it's not comfortable. My husband and I got married last year. My SIL got engaged last week and while I am over the moon for her and her fiance, I won't lie and say that it didn't sting a little not to be special anymore. Fortunately, I can handle my emotions like an adult so I'm not acting like a spoiled brat but your FSIL may not be able to deal with it. Pitching this fit is accomplishing what she wanted--now she's the center of attention again.

Your best solution here is to just ignore it. She's not talking, she says  everything is fine, so continue on as if it is. If she fusses, play dumb. ""I thought you said everything was fine? If you're mad, please tell me."" She's an adult, don't give in to this childish crap. Don't be mean, always be nice but don't be a pushover. 

It's rough, I know. Don't forget--you can't control what people do or think but you *can* control your reaction to them. Don't let her actions and petty, childish behavior ruin this exciting time for you. Congrats! "

waitingforjune,acappella,1388982454.0,"Yeah, pretty much the most/only important things to consider when choosing an alumni song:

-Everyone that has ever been in the group knows it (so something you've done since the first year the group existed or pretty close to it, ideally)

-Simple arrangement (as your group grows and gets older, you will hopefully have tons of alumni on stage singing, so you don't want something that will sound muddy due to being too busy)

-HIGHLY RECOMMEND not having a soloist. I've seen it done both ways, but I prefer when there is not a solo to be handed down. A group that I know hands down the solo to their alumni song, and one guy just absolutely crushed it like 8 years back, and nobody has lived up to him since, so he typically just does it at their big alumni show. Not a good look, IMO, but your mileage may vary.

Whatever you do, once you choose your alumni song, DON'T CHANGE IT. I don't care how lame you think Coney Island Baby (my alma mater group's alumni song) is 15 years down the road, that's not the point of an alumni song. Pick something good/timeless now, stick with it, and ensure that your group has tons of happy alumni for years to come!"

pinkfu,standupshots,1388982508.0,"Oh waaaah. You're kind of a pussy for a comedian. All this self righteous nonsense because instead of focusing on what I actually said you went with ""just an individual who doesn't GET JOKES"" mentality. It's the funniest joke I've seen from you yet. 

First and foremost, I am not saying ""facebook is the death of standup"" because I personally don't like facebook jokes (I already said some of them can work) or I have some personal dislike of facebook as a whole--that is a really stupid assumption based on literally no evidence. I rather enjoy my facebook experience but I don't stalk exes so maybe YOU are the one with facebook issues to work out.

So why did I say it? Well, I already told you: showcases now suck because you lazy fucks use really lame and repetative facebook jokes as the foundation of really whack sets. The crowd hates them. I have personally witnessed crowds go dead silent or groan at excessive facebook jokes. That was my point. Duh.

Second, since when is facebook a ""popular trend"" and for whom? Is your demo a bunch of 35 to 55 year old people? No? Because that is the only demo in which facebook is a growing trend. Look it up. Teens to people in their mid 20s are either not signing up or fleeing in droves. People in their mid-20s to mid-30s are scaling back their use due to security/privacy issues. Facebook was a popular joke topic in 2007, not 2014. So cutting edge.

Do you like to imagine that someone somewhere in South America is killing with Orkut jokes or maybe in some parallel universe someone is slaying crowds with Beebo jokes?

That all said, who cares if something is cutting edge or pop culture? Funny is funny. Boring is boring. Once you've heard the joke, hearing it told with tiny variations over and over within a short amount of time is going to be boring. Your joke falls in to this category of boring. In anything, the more edgy your shit is the more likely you're going to be repeating the same shit everyone else is. It's really more about delivery and context, right? But your joke, standing on it's own, here, is boring because it's been done to death. SORRY YOU DON'T AGREE but it's really no sweat off my nuts.

&gt; But guess what? There are people who hate jokes you like. I'm sure there are jokes you like that some others would consider ""hack"" or ""the death of comedy"", and you'd be offended that someone thought that of this thing you enjoy. So get over it, you don't dictate what is, isn't, can, or can't be funny.

If I got offended by jokes I would probably start considering therapy. If I got offended by other people not liking the things I like, I might consider shock therapy. 

But you're right, *I* don't dictate what's funny or not, but the silent, uncomfortable, groaning crowds I have routinely witness sure do. Since my comment was entirely based on those experiences at real life stand up shows and not my own personal taste (which should be obvious since I said so in my previous comments) you'll have to come up with some other way to rationalize the statement with your ego. Or not. Be delusional. Sometimes that's funny.

My real opinion of facebook jokes by standups is this: you are too sheltered, have too little real world experience or maybe just not enough real tragedy in your life to delve in to deeper levels of funny. Snore. It makes me cringe and I REALLY HATE IT when a comedian makes me feel pity for them. So uncomfortable. Okay? So now I (and many others, ime) get the fuck up and pretend to smoke outside until it's over.

Although, it did just occur to me that it might be a regional thing. Maybe it's just so fucking tired in LA but not caught up with New Orleans? Like fashion or any other bullshit trend? In the mid 90s I went on a trip around the country and took a pair of fairly crappy old Oakley wrap-around sunglasses with me. You would have thought I was carrying around Alien technology. 

Good luck, young comedian. I really do wish you well. I wish all comedians to do well because I &lt;3 standup. Don't ruin it for me, asshole. "

It's like when I apologize for something incredibly minor, like forgetting what kind of orange juice my boyfriend likes, and he says, ""It's over."" He's not really thinking of breaking up with me; he's exaggerating his reaction for comedic effect. I will sometimes do something similar in order to show the person how silly their question is, as well.

I really do think that, now that your girlfriend has seen what you've done before, and because you've never done it to her, she may feel that you're depriving her of something. Maybe she feels she's not getting what others have gotten. And don't think I'm siding with her, as I side with you on this. But have you ever bought her flowers? Have you ever taken her on a fancy date and covered the check? I only do that once every two months, really. When I do it, though, it means a lot to her."

In my state, the B.O. can't force money out of the boarder unless previously agreed to, but they can seize the horse *if money is owed* (they do not have to auction it thankfully).  The B.O. can't charge anything on top of the original contract though, so there would be no way to get money for upkeep.

I don't have any degree in theology, but my answer is probably going to be better than some random person who has never taken theology classes.


Canon law says that homosexuality is not a sin, but homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. Meaning you can be a homosexual catholic and have no problem getting into heaven, you just have to abstain from homosexual relationships and sexual acts.


I can not speak for them personally, but i would imagine they oppose gay marriage, and like i said before gay sex is a sin in the eyes of the church.


Gay adoption on the other hand is a different matter. My theology teacher was the MC of my diocese, and he said that single person adoption is fine. (pardon the pun) I maybe taking a leap of faith here, but I would imagine that a gay person adopting a child would be fine as long as they are not in a relationship or a practicing homosexual. Meaning having gay sex."

IBiteYou,politics,1388983730.0,"Are you developmentally disabled?  Have you ENTIRELY forgotten the conversation to this point?  I WORKED in an ER.

SOMETIMES you wait awhile in an ER and sometimes you don't.  It's completely determined by kismet.

&gt;It was not that damn crowded either.

And that statement is a part of the problem. 

You don't get seen in order of sign up.

You, when you go in, have NO IDEA what is going on beyond the doors.

If an ER has five critical patients... even though it has 17 beds... the time of the doc and staff is taken up trying to care for really urgent patients.

But you switched your point to wait time.

We are talking about Medicaid and Medicaid patient use of the ER.  They don't pay.  They don't have a deductible.  They have nothing to lose by using the ER.

A few weeks ago ... even though I have coverage, I went to a local clinic to be seen because I had gotten a bad upper respiratory thing.  It was the third day.  I drove to the clinic and when I went in I explained that I was short of breath and coughing.  I was taken back immediately.  Within minutes I was having a breathing treatment.  It didn't help and my lungs were terrible.  Now ... I was dealing with a PA that I knew from the ER and he was telling me how bad it was.  He said, ""We need to get you to the ER right away and we can't let you drive your private car, so we're calling an ambulance.""  Well... once I was in the ER I found out what was truly wrong.  My blood oxygen level was too low and they couldn't get it to raise.  I had steroids and three breathing treatments.  Fortunately the last one worked and they didn't have to admit me.

The ER was a MADHOUSE.  It's such a madhouse now that they are expanding it.  The xray and respiratory techs were great and they were pretty thorough in dealing with me ... but I have a deductible...and that bill is going to be a bitch.

I tried the clinic first.  The former colleague of mine who saw me in the ER said I should have been to the ER the night before.

kornberg,AskWomen,1388983747.0,"No one has addressed this yet--if the string breaks, you can *always* get the tampon out. You can bear down and push it out enough for you to grab or you can just reach up in there and grab it to pull. Your vagina is made to transport a 6-10 lb baby out of your uterus, it can certainly handle your fingers and a tampon. It's also not a tunnel--unless you do something pretty extreme, the cervix is not going to let a tampon through to your uterus. You will never accidentally lose a tampon inside of you.

However, that is irrelevant because the string will not break. You will never pull the string and not have the tampon on the end of it. They are woven into the tampon--buy a box and take a few apart so you can see with your eyes that there is no way you're going to lose the tampon inside of you. The string is very strong. They are made to collect liquids--peeing on the string, showering with the tampon in, going swimming with one in--none of that will compromise the effectiveness of the tampon because that is all normal use. 

And it doesn't matter if you pee on the string but as you can see, most people hold it to the side because a wet tampon string is not the most fun thing to have in your underwear. "

What's the balance? Do you suck it up and join in prayer to a god that doesn't exist, go to church services that hold little relevance just to show that you are being supportive? If mum needed me to drive her to church because she was too ill to get there herself I'd take her, but I don't know.

When you introduce an IoC container into the mix you are by its very nature testing more than a single chunk of code, you're by proxy testing that the IoC container works as well with every unit test.

You're using StructureMap based on your syntax, I believe, which is what I use as well, great framework and very well tested.

Orient your axes so that y points along the normal force and so x points up the incline. What's the x and y components of the gravitational force? Since the toolbox is in equilibrium, the *net* force in the x and y directions are 0. "

To me, it seems that anarchy is not something that America as a whole will ever achieve, especially since most people rely too heavily on the government.

Hearing my brother-in-law explain the dynamic of this city he used to live in (Crested Butte, CO), it was the most anarchist community I'd ever heard of. They don't allow any businesses unless the owner can provide proof that they live within city limits, their police don't mess with the locals (unless really needed) and only serve the purpose of protecting them from outsiders (it's a resort town so there are a lot of outsiders certain times of the year), and everyone knows each other. It sounded like the most ideal community I can think of. I would love to live there aside from the fact that it's incredibly expensive and the altitude is too high.

What're your sources?  I'm guessing Sa'adia Gaon (I seem to remember him describing) with some reconstruction based on early transcription?  I'm mostly curious about the vowels, since most reconstructions I see have a length distinction only, no quality difference.

&gt;Thanks. You'd be surprised how unnoticed it is. I read from the torah once with it and nobody said anything. The reason the changes happened is because how similar it sounds.

Well no one would notice the vowels.  But people would definitely notice the consonants, no?  And they kinda sound similar one step at a time--the changes happened over thousands of years, after all.

Silent-G,sex,1388985746.0,"Okay, let's ignore your obvious cynical outlook on life and focus on the phrase you used a couple times: ""play the game"", what is this so-called game you think you know how to play? Is the goal of the game to sleep with a girl, find a girlfriend? I don't understand why you think meeting someone is a game. I don't understand why you're even looking for help, it sounds like you just want people to agree with you and say ""Yup, you've been dealt a shitty hand in life, all girls are bitches because they won't sleep with you and one of them cheated on you."" Stop blaming all women for the actions of a select few, start trying to be a better person for the girl who couldn't care less about your disability, give up this non-existant ""game"" you've made up. Ignore the things in your life that you can't change and start working on the things that you can change, make real change, don't keep covering up your faults, be yourself. The only ""game"" you should be playing is the one where you become the best version of yourself that you can be.  
I know I'm still wrong, and nothing I've said will help, nothing anyone ever told me helped, but one day you'll be a better person and remember the people who weren't willing to validate your cynicism."

RhomboidStorm,Economics,1388985934.0,"I think the article was mostly apologizing for not making it higher as we go. The sad truth is that the corporate employers have a much easier time lowering the wage that market demand. Dimply look at outsourcing to see this in action. The idea of minimum wage is to sure that during a down economy composite can't simply force the wage down and keep it down. A simple peek into the industrial revolution and the depression will show that the ""free market"" only really benefits those at the top.

We also have to recognize that the market only looks at short term gains. This shortsightedness inures long term growth.  Only by looking ahead as a nation and steering the economy can we hope to keep long term gains.  The nursing shortage is s perfect example.  Despite rising healthcare costs there is little emphasis on getting trained nurses in place.  Good training takes time and the labor force cannot simply move from one smiley to another overnight.  We have to make sure that people who invest time into training can make a decent wage otherwise there is no incentive to learn the skills knowing you may be out on the street when the bubble bursts out some disruptive technology comes along.  

I rarely see economists look for information beyond the facts that will support what they want to present.  Even this article is over-simplified to price the point."

Round 2: L4D Zombies due to their speed and tendency to swarm a target. The Headcrab zombies are slow and clumsy, so the L4D zombies would be able to pick them off one by one because they wouldn't be able to react fast enough to the approaching horde.

Round 3: Headcrab zombies, similar to my point from round one, before a Headcrab zombie dies, it's headcrab jumps to a new host, so if they got close to the L4D survivors (who most likely would be caught off guard by this), the headcrabs could jump to each one until only Gordon Freeman is left, and then it's only a matter of time before Gordon runs out of ammo and isn't fast enough with his crowbar to keep them from swarming him"

They're people, they just want someone to be together with, someone who accepts them. There *are* people out there who are okay with dating a transwoman. Bisexuals and pansexuals, but also straight men who don't care that they're trans and just treat them like any other women. These people wouldn't feel betrayed. Basically what trans people are doing is trying to find someone like that, and really the only way to do that is keep trying with different people until you find one who is okay with it."

Also, I have close-ish acquaintances/distant friends from a lot of different spheres of my life, and sometimes I wonder if the reason they don't invite me for big events is that they assume I'm already doing something with my ""other friends"".

kornberg,psychology,1388987868.0,"While I am on the fence about ADD/ADHD, my inability to focus on tasks that I am not happy about doing and my severe hyper-focus on things that I do find interesting impedes my ability to function at the level I can be capable of. That is real. If I could make it go away, I would. It's not fun to suck at what I need to do to keep a roof over my head. I hate having to rely on a stimulant that messes with my appetite, my skin and my sleep. The constant struggle to function adds up and it definitely was a very big contributor to bouts of severe depression. Since I've been re-medicated (on meds in late high school, back on at age 30), I have very few problems with depression. I graduated college, I have a good job and I have the mental resources to deal with real life because I am not fighting all day just to function.

I don't care what it's called but I've never been able to do what others seem to be able to do and unfortunately, those abilities are required to be a functioning adult. There was not enough OT to get me through grade school unmedicated--forget college. My SATs and IQ were in the 97th percentile but I failed out of college multiple times because I was not capable of doing what needed to be done to pass without meds. 

Maybe requiring children and adults to be sedentary and have the focus required to succeed is the problem but I don't see that changing any time soon and the bandaid that works for a lot of people is medication. I'm not going to agree with denying people the help they need to fulfill their potential and succeed in the society we have because people don't like giving kids stimulants. 

Stop trying to take away the bandaid and fix the problem."

&gt;In a few cases where a moderator has lost touch with their community, another redditor has created a competing community and subscribers have chosen to use the new reddit instead, which led to it becoming the new dominant reddit.

&gt;If you have an issue with a moderator or the way a subreddit is being run, please first try contacting that moderator to see if it's just a simple misunderstanding. You may contact all of the moderators in a subreddit by messaging /r/[name of subreddit] to appeal a decision. Please keep in mind, ***however, that moderators are free to run their subreddits however they so choose so long as it is not breaking reddit's rules. This means that moderators of certain subreddits can and have banned people from their subreddit for sending a message to them.*** So if it's simply an ideological issue you have or a personal vendetta against a moderator, consider making a new subreddit and shaping it the way you'd like rather than performing a sit-in and/or witch hunt.

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1388988699.0,"The second clause was explaining how I manage my empathy. How I manage not simply feeling for others and in response to them but because of them, if you've ever heard of emotional contagion that's what's going on and I can't really tell where my emotions end and other's begin so at times I need to choose between allowing myself to feel at all and not being in control of myself. At times somebody projects so strongly despite not really showing it that I get near them and it hits me so hard that it's like somebody sucker punched me, I just sort of shut everything down and give up on feeling for an hour or two.

I'm starting to think that I'm never going to be able to properly communicate the type of person I'm trying to figure out, I'll just need to take solace in the fact that they are rare enough that I can deal with not understanding how they think prior to being forced to interact and I find it simple enough to turn people against somebody who causes nothing but strife. Who knows perhaps it will lead to a net gain for humanity, the world could do with fewer assholes and a significant proportion former assholes are repentant enough to try to do good."

Since the Batgirls are all gone but Barbara anyway, they're not in the picture, and Steph wouldn't be coming back in Eternal. Barbara might never have been crippled. 

Ultimately the issue is the Robins. If Batman had been 'properly' rebooted, we'd either never see a lot of well-known characters ever again or we'd spend the next decade at least re-doing old stories. Who wants to read Batman and Son *again*, ten years from now? No one. So the option was either keep the timeline mostly intact or make a lot of people very angry by disappearing even more of Batman's supporting cast. I sure as Hell wouldn't want to have to wait five or six years to see Tim again.

On that subject, I don't want to see Tim right now, either. Teen Titans sucks."

Even if it's someone the baby does know, they may get fussy not being held by mom or dad. That's another very valid reason.

In this poem, you're basically saying:

""Hey, you know that guy you trust? Me? Your uncle? Well, the next guy that's like me to come into your life is going to rape you. He's out there. So be prepared! Get a knife!""

It's just ... peculiarly dark. You're heart's in the right place, and I think you do a good job expressing your conflict of emotions in this piece, I even agree with many of sentiments, but overall it seems inappropriate and strange.

Yes, it's more explicit, but you have to manually close all your resources or, tada, you have a leak. In C++, you just put cleanup code in destructors and the language handles the rest, regardless of how or where a function exits.



As others have said, find me another language that gives you systems-level speed and control _and_ some high level niceties. This combination makes C++ essential for real-time-ish things like video games, and there really aren't any other contenders right now.

Tons of people in the modern day don't seem to understand criticism. I think the digital age has really damaged our ability to think past one-dimensional litmus representations of things. A critic does not represent *truth,* they represent a certain (well-established, admitted, and studied) bias. You read the review in the context of their biases because you *know who they are.* You know their review isn't faked; it might be diplomatic but it's honest enough.

The ""n stars"" or ""thumbs up/down"" review system is lowest common denominator bullshit. The point of reviews and critics is to really understand the *experience* someone had and to extrapolate from that what your own experience might be.

Ten thousand people on Yelp might have certain tastes that aren't yours. So you'll scroll through five or six short undescriptive blubs or long-winded rants, none of which get to the heart of what really are the qualities of the restaurant, because you don't have much knowledge of the subjective framework of these people. Someone who likes big, fancy restaurants would disdain my favorite Mexican joint for being a dim hole in the wall, while a foodie would praise the quality of their ingredients and excellent traditional flavors, while a Mexican traditionalist may or may not accept its authenticity but would acknowledge it serves dishes rarely found in Mexican restaurants. Knowing *who your critic is* gives you a sense of what they mean when they say, ""I did like,"" or ""I didn't like""."

capughe,fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,1388989912.0,"Sort of related story about strangers saving your children, I saw a little girl (maybe 3) walking through a parking lot by herself. Seemed like she was headed for the sidewalk. My parents and I were just looking at each other like ""Should we go get her and call the police or something?"" when this guy comes running across the parking lot after her. In my memory he was a young guy and both he and the girl looked either Filipino or First Nations so I thought ""Oh good her father or relative,"" but when the girl saw him, she started running away.

So I thought ""Oh shit is she playing around? Or is she about to be kidnapped?"" The guy gets her to hold his hand and she starts walking away down the sidewalk with him calmly.

My parents and I could see him clearly and he was definitely within chasing distance since he wasn't heading to a car or anything.

Then he starts yelling and waving at a young couple about 50 yards away heading for the next corner crossing. In a moment the freaked out parents are running back for the child they left behind in the Goodwill parking lot."

The quote "" there are no women on the internet"" had nothing to do with gender and everything to do with directness.  Men only play these relationship games because women expect them too and this society does.  There had been an  artificial communication barrier between the genders for years.  The fact that men treat women like other men over the internet is two-fold.  

1. Men are not likely to have a relationship with women over the internet so there is no train for games.

2. Direct is how men show each other respect.  We don't make people guess how we feel and we aren't subtle when we're upset.  You are being treated like a man, not a woman that needs to be coddled.

The very idea that women cry for equality and then complain when we treat then like we do each other is a slap in the face.

I was talking about the ""no one's ever heard of it/unsung Jewish heroes"" part. Some media outlets are absurd in the way that they'll go out of their way to lionize Israel because it sends aid or medical teams to crisis zones.

&gt; flying around the world trying to stop genocide

Well you did say that they were going around trying to stop genocide. Which is bullshit, not the least because the Israeli state doesn't give two shits-- that means if these Jews actually were trying to stop genocide then they wouldn't be doing it in the name of Israel.

&gt;  I said there are teams of Israelis who travel to conflict zones and provide aid, mostly medical and organizational, to refugees and minority groups facing persecution.

There are plenty of organizations that do this as their reason for existing, and who achieve a lot, or at least try to, in this regard. 

You imply, again, that these Israelis are acting on their own accord and illegally (admittedly the Israeli government especially isn't  a fan of international law). I guess that means that they're either acting in a questionable way, as humanitarian work isn't illegal, or they're not working ""representing"" Israel as their government often claims they are, and so ""we're morally superior and can't be criticized"".

&gt; All your arguments pretty much point to you responding to a point I'm saying and then saying ""No"" or ""That's not true"" or ""No they don't.""

Baby_Lika,self,1388990578.0,"I would like to echo /u/microwave_safe_bowl and mention that I have undergone a similar experience where two years ago, my mother was diagnosed with a 6cm olfactory groove meningioma. Her tumour was benign and had to be operated on within the following week upon discovering it.

It was a tough thing to go through because I was only 25 years old and an only child, but I am truly thankful for the support system I've had, and these people will be key to keeping things grounded as things will move fast.

The operation was a success, and in fact, it's true that so much progress has been made when it comes to neurology. I was amazed at how brain surgeons are able to keep composure and hold everything together when performing such complicating procedures. My mother's surgeon and his team spent 8 hours in the operating room to say the least, that's some steady hands!

All of this to say that, he will be in good hands and the recovery period will pose some new challenges. Your half-brother may experience a change in personality or habits (could be the meds, which is something worth monitoring). Expect a lot of follow-up appointments and specialists who will likely continue to monitor trends for the long-term.

I've also long accepted that there's no such thing as ""back to normal"". While not necessarily a bad thing, it has allowed me to accept many changes that came with this kind of procedure, but assume that you're almost meeting a new person again.

moose_man,Christianity,1388991747.0,"I'm gonna make the same argument for pot that I make for alcohol, even if I don't smoke or drink either.

Really, I think it's fine, so long as you practice it safely and in correct situations. People make arguments against drunkenness, which is fair in many cases, because drunk people do a lot of stupid crap. But if you know your limits and know you can stop yourself from doing stupid crap, it's fine. To back up my argument with evidence from the Bible, remember Jesus' miracle at the wedding at Canaan. If Jesus was against drinking at all, he would not have created more alcohol to be consumed. Now, as for drunkenness, remember that the comment about how the best wine was usually served first. This was because the guests would be too drunk to truly appreciate the drink later and wouldn't notice a decline in quality.

Now, taking these things into account, we think about Jesus' actions and the way He lived His life. Jesus was not a man who just went with the flow; he challenged societal norms and traditions to promote justice and love. If Jesus was so against drunkenness, why would he allow it to continue by supplying the guests at the wedding with more wine?

Now, I could be wrong here. If someone better versed in theology comes along and proves me wrong, I'm ready to change my position, but that's how I think at the moment.

So think of this. Jesus, IMO, would be okay with you enjoying yourself here, so long as it doesn't make you do bad things. Watch your behaviour, because it's easy for us to fall into bad habits and actions, but I would say it's generally fine."

Think of the 5-drops in red that are already in most lists:

* Thundermaw Hellkite
* Siege-Gang Commander
* Kiki-Jiki
* Zealous Conscripts

or compare it to one of the few (if only) red 6-drops worth running - Inferno Titan. All of these cards do something right away when they hit the board. In the average red deck, you want a game to be over as fast as possible. Hellkite Tyrant doesn't do that... It's a fat body with flying, and his artifact-kidnapping ability is conditional at best; he's just too slow, and if your opponent doesn't have an artifact on the board, his ability doesn't do anything.

Stealing those artifacts is NOT ""free"" to you. You are playing a 6-mana 6/5 that actually has to wait a turn to connect for the *chance* to steal artifacts, *if* your opponent has any. Seems cool to steal a sword or jitte, but if your opponent played a smaller critter and has been beating away at you with a sword, chances are you aren't in a position to pull ahead of the game. A slow 6/5 doesn't provide an immediate answer that is necessary to deal with a beast like Umezawa's Jitte. Something like Torch Fiend, Manic Vandal, or Smash to Smithereens deals with problem artifacts vastly more efficently, and provide opportunity for additional damage. If you're looking for power, Thundermaw Hellkite just does it better, and there are more efficient options available.

&gt;With trample, flying, and 6 power, it shouldnt be too difficult to deal at least 1 point of damage right?

You would be surprised. With premium removal at a high concentration, it's not at all unlikely for Tyrant to get slapped with a Swords to Plowshares, Doom Blade, Path to Exile, or any of the other many removal spells in cube. If you tap out to cast Hellkite Tyrant and I spend 2 mana on your end step to Go for the Throat it, I just got to Time Walk. This is a huge reason why it is so important for creatures to provide value to you even if they die right away, or have some sort of evasive protection like Hexproof or Shroud. Think Thrun, the Last Troll or Simic Sky Swallower. Both are very tricky to kill, but still have big butts.

TL;DR: Waaaay too slow, and there is very little necessity for high-CMC cards in red. Artifact stealing is situational at best, there are simply more efficient options available. Keep him in EDH where he was intended to exist."

sockmonkeysaurus,relationships,1388992026.0,"&gt; This strong and overwhelming hatred towards this person to whom sex is like pulling a new stick of gum out of the package and chewing it and spitting it out when it stops being fun. And now my girlfriend is that gum.

You are directing your feelings of hatred towards the wrong person. You are treating your girlfriend like shit after she got raped. You are assigning blame to your girlfriend because she went to a party and was raped. Rather than direct your anger, hurt and hate towards the guy who raped her, you are directing these feelings towards a woman who was just raped.  And you called your girlfriend a used piece of gum because someone raped her. This does not sit well with me at all, and I would put money on it that if you compared someone who was sexually assaulted or raped to a chewed piece of gum, they would feel nothing but shame, embarrassment and regret that they told you what happened to them. You call your girlfriend a chewed up piece of gum: everyone here looks at you as a piece of shit."

Sing to distract yourself. Wear your baby because it's going to happen when you're the most sleepy, and you don't want to drop your little love. I sang Broadway songs, ska music, love songs, 40s hits... Everything. It allowed me to step out of the immediate terror that my kid was miserable and I was helpless.

* Ethnocracy: only a certain race can hold powe

* 'Cottage' economies: dominated by cottage industries; small, independent operations of skilled workers
* Gift economies: where trade is done by giving gifts with some expectations of receiving a gift later

&gt;You prefer spending your time at work to coming home - some days I can't say I blame you. After 12 hours with only two toddlers to keep me company, I'm pretty sure I'm not the most fascinating company in the world. I'm pretty sure I'm not the prettiest, either. I used to take the time to get all dolled up for you before you came home - but you never noticed. If you can't tell the difference between two hours of blowdrying and makeup and no shower and an old tshirt, why bother? It's too depressing. I gave up on that long ago. 

&gt;I've given up trying to get the truth out of you. You are, hands down, the world's best liar. After so many years selling cars, it's not surprising, but still. I consider myself a connoisseur of body language. I can read people like a book.... but you still fool me almost half the time. Well done, I guess? Anyways, I've given up on a lot of stuff. I don't have a man who is passionately in love with me, I don't have a husband I can trust to be honest, and I don't have a guy who comes home as soon as he can after work. That's fine. It's not cool, but I've made my peace with it. You're nice to me, you're smart, you've got good hygiene and don't snore, and you've got a good sense of humor. It could be a hell of a lot worse.

This makes me incredibly sad to read because it seems that you've reached an internal acceptance that you will never be truly happy with this man, and you understand that by staying in this marriage, you will not get the kind of passion most people search for.

As for batteries there are a few things to know. First buy a fresh set of matched 10 amp batteries. Preferably two sets. This is because you need to have matched age and discharge cycles batteries. Once you put batteries in the Duke the right way. They will be married for life. You can un-marry and remarry them ONCE. So don't do it unless you have an emergency need to. Second label them as a set and so that you can tell what battery is what. That way you can change the lead battery each time you place them in your Duke. So if a battery started on the left move it to the right on the second usage, and back for the third etc. etc. etc. You also might want to invest in a voltage meter for your batteries if you don""t have a way to check the volts already."

Wrong.  The reason they can  do whatever they like to foreigners at the border is that they are armed, and the traveller usually isn't.  Imprisoning someone without charges, destroying their property, etc, are still crimes, even though the thugs who commit these crimes are rarely held to account.

The constitution is the entirety of the legal basis for the American federal government's existence.  It is binding upon that government at all times, in all places.  When an  American official exercises a power not granted by the constitution, that official is not acting legally.

On top of the deaths from actual overdose, alcohol kills a _lot_ of people, every day, by the effects that it has on the body long term. Alcoholics die really miserable deaths, and it's usually due to complications of health problems resulting from alcohol abuse.

Then there's all the people who have an accident at the house, etc. and the death isn't even attributed to alcohol. Even if it's a 65-year-old lifetime alcoholic falling down the stairs drunk.

So yeah, alcohol turns out to be really bad when you've got the unfortunate genes that cause your body to develop the tolerance and dependence that are the hallmarks of alcoholism. Something like 10% of Americans have it."

PracticalDemonkeepin,canadients,1388994064.0,"I'll speak; my recommended daily dosage is 3 grams a day, currently I can get this for 2-5$/g depending on the source, 5-7.50$/g if I go to a dispensary (when I was in Ontario this was 5-12$, B.C prices are much better). I don't smoke nearly that much, a gram a day if I'm lucky, so I'll put it at a gram a day. That's 60-150$ at best for me, while the codeine contin prescription I was getting prior would have been 60$/per month. Now, when this law goes into effect, I am going to be looking at paying 7-10$/g, which at my very low amount of 1g per day will come out to 210-300$ before any shipping costs (and possible tax?). As someone who makes little over 1000$ per month, having nearly a quarter to a third of my monthly income go to medicine is quite hindering after paying for rent/food/bills. So I'm left with this option, do I spend a third of my income on cannabis, or do I go back to picking up that 60$ codeine contin script? 

This is an example of how someone who smokes much less than most prescribed starting doses could be forced out of medicinal cannabis financially; there are people on disability who need much higher doses than I do, who have even less than I do financially. IMO the flexibility of the current market is what makes this a viable option for most MM users, and from my understand of the new laws, that is what is being removed from Canada's medical marijuana system. 

 Now that that is said, this is my experience, and I actually know very little about Canada's MMAR laws; I just buy my cannabis and use it when needed. If anything I have said is factually wrong, I won't e offended if anyone points it out."

I think it's mostly because on guys, everything right there out in the open, no hidden components. So you can see all the bells and whistles, so to speak. With women, the good majority is inside, so most people don't make that distinction between the parts as easily as you can with male parts. Especially trying to explain to kids the various distinctions, it can be hard when they can't actually see it for themselves to remember.

You can only be told that the person doing it is helping you so many times before you start to believe them on some level, it didn't matter that I knew it was abuse I thought I deserved it but I had no idea why. When it stopped I couldn't figure out why and I was starting to come to terms with the fact that I didn't deserve it and that hurt, when he started to try to bully me it gave me something else to attribute the pain to, something that was causing me more pain and giving me more time to come to terms with things because the same part of me that felt I deserved the earlier treatment clung to what he was doing. Honestly I think he may have saved my life by doing that, I was depressed and prior to what he was doing I was heading into suicidal territory but when he did I recovered a bit, I had more time to deal with the pain. I was still depressed, I had figured out how to act a long time before so nobody really knew, not even the people who saw me when I couldn't keep it going (it's funny because that was the same time that my brother became depressed due to an inhaler he had been put on and he seemed pretty damn happy compared to me, he bottomed out well above where my act topped out but he's the one that people went crazy over).

No, most of them won't. When I slip a little people think I'm putting on an act to push people away. I'm unreadable, seemingly insane (as anyone who can't be understood but appears to understand what they're saying does), unapproachable, unpredictable, and utterly alien. At least that's how I've been described. That's ignoring all of the pain and rage and sorrow that I'd have to deal with if I actually tried to be me again, it's not something I can deal with on my own and there's nobody that I can trust to help me through it, plenty of people I can trust to abandon me because they can't deal with somebody like that. It's not a matter of them not caring about me, it's a matter of people having been taught that they can't care. People rarely do the hard thing, especially when there are easier options with the same results. Have you ever felt as if you don't belong, that you were truly alien and simply weren't meant to be where you are, that you belong in some other place, some other time? That's my life, every waking second I feel as if I don't belong, that society itself rejects me (and in general society agrees on that point) and thus I wear a mask, I make nice, I play at being like everybody else yet still I feel truly alone. I found that I'm far from alone, that others like me feel the same, that when I've tried to explain myself to others around them it hasn't simply resonated but it was as if I was speaking from their heart instead of my own even there, even though I'm solidly a part of them I feel as if somehow I don't belong. Adrift in the sea of humanity, occasionally passing somebody who makes me feel as if I belong for an instant but never finding anyone who truly accepts me. There are a few types of loneliness, the sort that I feel is never good. It brings silence and clarity but it's oppressive."

I drank as much as I could as fast as I could without just puking it up and I still didn't manage to black out. I clearly remember who the whole night.

I remember the walls tilting and swaying on me. I remember I couldn't look at the window blinds because they kept moving up and down like one of those optical illusions. I remember the driver(sober) took a left turn that really confused me on the way home, because on the road we were on it should have been a right to go where we needed to go but instead it was a left(I'm still not sure how this happened I may just have lost the ability to discern left from right for a while). I fell down so many times I lost count, but I remember everything. I even remember waking up still slightly drunk the next day.

I was assigned as a navigator and my mom was too busy telling me off about either how terrible my dad was our how shitty of a daughter I am or another family member to notice me telling her to make a turn, causing about an hour of cussing me out about how useless I was. Also if any of us were to loud she'd pull over and kick us out and drive off, usually in the middle of nowhere. She'd come back eventually but my brothers would be as young as 18 months and be left on the side of the road. I would get out with them causing her to cuss as she drove off. The Times I stayed she'd laugh especially if they started walking back in the general direction of home. 

I am also terrified of stairs after watching my mom use them to punish my stepsister by throwing her down them. 

I'm scared of men. I've had nightmares since I was in elementary school about having to stuck my grandfather off (my mom swears it could never have happened but he did rape her growing up) and she pretty much led me to believe every man I would ever love would rape me and hurt me. So far it's been almost true.

midgaze,stopdrinking,1388998214.0,"Hey, I'm 34 and I stopped this year. It was really hard, but it's really worth it. Here are some things that you need to know.

You don't quit for other people. You quit for yourself. I have a 2 year old who I was being a crappy father for, and I'm a _way_ better dad now. Pancakes-in-the-morning-go-on-a-hike-with-him-on-my-shoulders-on-a-Sunday better. However this is not your motivation, just a great side benefit.

You have probably come to the realization that you are one of the people who have the genes that allow your body to develop a high tolerance to alcohol and to get physically addicted to it. It sucks quitting something you're that addicted to, but the intense cravings will pass. The constant thoughts of drinking will subside. It takes time, and unfortunately it requires you to not drink at all to make it get better. You can't have the option to drink or it haunts your thoughts. Moderation does not get easier with time or practice, as any alcoholic can attest. If you fail at it you will continue to fail at it. This is because moderation is no fun, and you can't enjoy alcohol without diving in the deep end. Sorry, sucks for me too.

You are going to lose your old social life. This sucks. There are more important things.

Your health will improve, beginning immediately. My pudgy face and red-flecked complexion reverted to a way healthier-looking me. Zero effort -- just a decent diet and no alcohol.

Again, you will be sorely tempted to cut yet another deal with yourself that allows you to drink under some circumstances. It's a trap. Send your brain back to its hole. You have to keep this monkey locked up or it will totally run amok again.

Sure, one day at a time, but this is for your whole life. Every week in early sobriety you will notice new things that are better. You start to enjoy things again, notice sights and sounds that give you pleasure. You rediscover things you used to like but forgot about. Spending years deriving all your pleasure from the one thing you're addicted to has robbed you of these things, and you will get them back now.

In order to really let all this take shape in your mind, you should share it with other alcoholics. AA is good for this. I have mixed feelings about AA but the best thing about it is that it is a chunk of time that you dedicate to your problem. You need to reflect on it frequently in early sobriety. If you don't do AA then keep a journal and write in it frequently. It feels good to talk about this stuff though, especially with other alcoholics, because they understand this stuff in a way that others tend not to. This subreddit is great, but not a replacement for listening to flesh and blood people talk about stuff.

It is also very important to keep learning. The first chapters of the AA big book are good. You will see yourself described in that book, and it will remove all doubt about where you're coming from. Learn about what makes alcoholics physiologically different than ""normal"" heavy drinkers too. I sort of needed a scientific way of looking at it, and there's plenty of info out there.

Good luck. Remember, send your brain back to its hole."

False. He attempted it and ran out of power because he'd been using it all day to save the earth.


Goku was weaker in his child form in GT COMPARED to his GT adult form. Fact.  This does not mean Kid GT Goku is weak, or weaker than his Z self by any means. As I said, Rhildo is even stronger than Buu, I'd say AT THE VERY LEAST as strong as Super Vegito from Z, and we see KID GT Goku - in base form - tooling Rhildo without so much as breaking a sweat. We can assume the Buu he compares Rhildo to is the mightiest Buu, even though he said ""**Majin Buu**"" (known as the fat Buu to fans) because after the Buu saga, everyone called the fat Buu either Mr. Buu or Good Buu. Goku calls Kid Buu ""Majin Buu"" as well.

The last person to beat down a power level like Buuhan's was Super Vegito (even though Super Vegito was not THAT much more powerful than MAX powered Buuhan. What set them worlds apart was the combination of supreme mental fortitude, martial arts skills AND that raw power Vegito combined). So I can safely say Base GT Kid Goku is at the very very least in the realm of power of Super Vegito.

When they start transforming and powering up, they leave the highest Z power levels IN THE DUST.


&gt;Beerus wasn't even using 70% of his power against SSJG Goku. Plus, regular Ki doesn't work on Gods.

Regular what? Did you miss the part where a enraged saiyan **mortal** not only evaded shots from Beerus, but also LANDED flush on him? Even if he was totally off-guard, hell, SLEEPING even, if what you say was any true, he would have not felt anything when Vegeta rocked him.

Goku in GT is **thousands** of times stronger than Enraged SSJ2 Vegeta. He would eat Beerus' soul, and Whiss' too."

sp00nzhx,AskReddit,1388999226.0,"Here's your major problem: It's not laziness and it's not idiocy. Two years ago, I would be agreeing with you wholeheartedly.

This is the problem with education the world over: prestige dialects are considered the only proper way to speak a language, and this is entire and utter nonsense. You say my example of ""hella"" isn't related. I beg to differ. You state that it's an evolution of a word. Yes, so is AAVE's ""aks"". (By the way, here's a quick [Wiktionary entry](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/acsian) on the Old English form of the word). It's a process called metathesis, which is where nearby sounds switch places. Think about how we say ""iron"". It's not ""EYE-ron"", it's ""EYE-urn"".

And, again, spelling is a very recent invention.

If I may, I'd like to take a short trip back through time. Two hundred thousand years ago, thereabouts, is when we can safely say that our species, *Homo sapiens sapiens*, emerged onto the world stage. We had developed over many many thousands of years with a plethora of skills and abilities at our disposal that allowed us, humans, to not only survive, but thrive, in our environments. One of these is largely regarded as the ability to speak as we can nowadays. By contrast, writing systems emerged only about five thousand years ago, by our best estimates, in ancient Mesopotamia. That's one hundred and ninety five thousand years for speech to develop completely separate from any other representation of our unique expression of thoughts and ideas.

Literature and, by extension, literacy are wonderful tools for humanity. They allow for the easy and (relatively) rapid dissemination of thought through shared language. They allow for the documentation of the human condition. They have been instrumental throughout recent history, both as tools for good and for ill. They are no arbiter for the English language, and there never has been an arbiter for the English language. This is uniquely beautiful to the language when compared to other major languages who rail so heavily against change and suppress any difference in language - French has a regulatory agency, as does Spanish and several other large languages.

Don't let spelling fool you. Keep an open mind. Respect the differences between you and the person next to you. All I can say is that I hope to have helped even just a modicum in leading you to a more accepting view about the English language, and that I hope you'll look into things further (needn't be language/linguistics, but any other prejudices that you may have (not saying that you do, but knowing humans it's hard to find a human without a single prejudice), but you get my point)."
tautomers,infj,1388999257.0,"I am also gay.

So, he's ""straight"" but you aren't sure? Don't touch it. My personal philosophy is I will not even give a guy a second thought until I have proof that he is bi or gay. Not worth the effort, energy and stress. The tool I often use is I say that I am gay. If someone is out *and* either sociable *or* interested, they will say they are gay back. Think about it; if a guy you liked said he is gay, how quickly would you say ""I'm gay too"" back to him? It's a logical social path, and unless it is completed, then the odds are there isn't a match up there. Relationships that ""last"" often form together with pretty high ease. Put yourself out there, and let them offer it up to you. I am fairly certain that if you over push this it will all blow up in your face. 

I would *highly* advise you to not stress about finding ""the one"" or just a relationship in general. It's a huge unneeded stressor. Just let it happen.

As far as being gay and INFJ? Well, honestly there isn't much to be said. Both are two parts of myself that aren't entirely important and I don't use them as badges to my identity very often. I have found in the past that using either as a badge was honestly somewhat pidgeonholeing."

qqwasd,worldnews,1388999317.0,"Piracy is defined as: 
&gt;the practice of attacking and robbing ships at sea

I don't think there is any way to argue that Sea Shepard's actions, as described here, could be classified as piracy. They are intentionally interfering with their operations, and doing their utmost to prevent the activities of the Japanese whalers, however they are neither attacking or robbing the Japanese ships. Their previous actions are a different matter entirely, and I can see their previous actions (such as boarding whaling vessels) falling under this definition. 

The definition of terrorism is a little trickier, as it is hotly debated and has never been agreed upon. Often accepted definitions are, in my opinion, designed to circumvent any accusation of this act directed towards governments (the use of the term ""unauthorized"" for example). Whatever the case, I think its a bit extreme to call them an eco-terrorist group, given that there have been no reported cases of people being hurt as a result of their operations, although it has had the potential to occur following some of their more extreme actions. 

I don't see the relevance in attempting to label a group using emotionally charged terms, that only leads to greater confusion and bandwagoning. It is more appropriate to place an argument for or against the organisation, instead of making a bitter and condensing designed to ironically attract the attention of the predictable movement of people who like to think themselves better than others merely because they're going against the grain.

If you browse the top comments on this article many focus on the the legality, morality and practicality of these operations, as opposed to any circle jerk around S.S.. Those in support of the operation are entirely entitled to their opinion, and, I think you'll find, generally focus on a desire for the governments to take more authoritative action on the issue.

However, at the same time I believe it is important to state what happens in practice because in practical situations the more realistic scenario is the one someone needs to prepare for. As an Indonesian I don't know a single couple in my extended family that didn't date prior to marriage - this includes my grandparents and every single aunt and uncle - and I also know several women who have married with non-Muslims they dated who converted before their marriage once the relationship became serious. Now these converts range from non-practicing Muslims to extremist Muslims, but that's another topic altogether. The OP explicitly stated that he did not believe conversion is within reason for him so obviously this would not work in his case. However, of all the men that I've met who have converted for marriage, none of them have dated their now-wives with the intention of ever converting, but after keeping an open mind they have ended up where they are now. With the traditional practices of courtship none of these couples would exist and I think it is worth stating that even though this isn't a ""right"" way of courtship, it is a relatively common practice in places like Indonesia, and it is something I would tell to a man like the OP to think about."

Valve is doing this as part of a massive blowback against Windows 8, which they see as an anticompetitive cesspool. They've realized that Linux systems are as capable as Windows, and that they can gain more power at a lesser price point, so as to directly compete not only with consoles, but with all other PC gaming systems. To address something else, the people who talk about ""jimmy rigging"" programs are using a system called WINE, which allows Windows programs to run over Linux, kind of a testament to its flexibility, but it's still not perfect, by a long shot. Back on topic with SteamOS, Valve has figured out they can give an incentive to developers to work on a lower cost, simple alternative to the pain in the ass that DirectX and Windows in general has become, so it works out well for both parties. This is fairly rambly here, so if you reply to this, I'd love to give an in depth explanation of this, after I get some sleep and such. It might be late at night though."

Alteriorid,audioengineering,1389002018.0,"This sub is terrible for down-votings things that it doesn't agree with, instead of downvoting illegitimate/irrelevant content. 

/u/Zovistograt makes great points about a facet of music that career-audio folks oft disregard as being credible. I am assuming /u/Zovistograt is talking about electronic music, and even if not, the sentiment going forth remains the same.

IMO you're just a bunch of proverbial crotchety old men who aren't keeping up with what's new. There was a time when The Beatles weren't considered music, and this rock and roll was devil song. It's the same scene with different cast and set fifty three years later. Something new coming up doesn't render the old obsolete necessarily. They're not coming for your job, and they don't want it.

I produce electronic music spanning several niches you'd never even dream up, yet I am formally trained in tracking/mixing using everything from DAT and a half million dollar Lafont film scoring mixer (72, 64+8) to Pro Tools HD and a control surface. It's not just ""unts unts"" and dubstep of the Skrillex variety, but heartfelt, fully produced pieces of sound art. My sound design has it's foundation in the fundamental principles of audio - and instead of simply capturing it, I *create it* with a combination of synthesis (FM, AM/RM, Subtractive, Additive, Granular), processing, and often sampling from various sources - live or otherwise. What I do is often quantized where it matters but not everywhere unless that's exactly what I am after. People say that what I do lacks soul, but I challenge them to design a multi-timbral synth patch with key-track and velocity-track and random-track macros *and play it in such a way that it's expressive*.

People can do every aspect on their own. People can collaborate. I'm not going to condemn nor endorse either way, for they both hold merit. You can't beat an award-winning team, but I'd still applaud the autodidact.

Most people listen to mp3's anyway so what should anyone care, anyway."

Alternatively, nowadays just about every canned veggie is made no-sodium. I usually buy that and just rinse the canned salmon I eat daily. I think for fish (according to Duke) it can remove up to 75% of the sodium."

*Possibly* sacrificing long-term health is an interesting strategy. Can you survive that diet and come out with no adverse sides? Sure, I'd bet the average otherwise healthy person could. But considering how incredibly easy it is to just not eat that insane amount of sodium I have no idea why you'd risk subjecting yourself to the possible negative side effects of such a diet. 6,000mg of sodium is ridiculous.. How do you even hit that?"

TigerLily1,AskWomen,1389003644.0,"Yes!!! Two years ago I met my now boyfriend. We met at work, dated for a while and hooked up. I was really into him but we both had gotten out of long term relationships like one month prior to meeting and he was just feeling like he didn't give himself enough time. Secondly, he was applying to be a police officer at the time, finally got in and started the 7 month academy and things kind of fizzled out. We did keep in touch and go to dinner once or twice and eventually we both dated our ex's again. Well June 2013 and he texts me and my heart fell to my stomach. I swear the day we met I knew he was it and spent a long time convinced that he would come around. About a week later we had breakfast and well we haven't been apart since! We're now talking about moving in together, we're a great couple with a strong relationship and open communication!

I think what worked was that I didn't judge him on his activities while I ""waited"" and also knew there could be a chance he wouldn't come around. But sometimes I think you know in your gut there is someone worth waiting for and you should go for it. And not to mention I did my own thing but as soon as he came around I was strict on ""we're giving this a real chance or nothing. And if you don't want to be with me after all this then I'm done with all of it."" It worked out great for us!"

I'm gonna try and convince you now that this girl is not trustworthy. Where shall we begin? Best to start with what you know. So, what do we know? She came into the waiting room, and introduced herself as his girlfriend. And she told you not to cause any drama.

IMO the most important question now is: Why would she tell you that? (i.e. what does she try to accomplish by doing that)

* She's a mean person that tries to drive you two apart, by making you worry to a point where it gets messy just because you worry so much that the relationship might be fubar when your SO wakes up. She could possibly be just a bad person, or a mean ex, or she's just jealous
* She's crazy. She believes to be his GF, even though he thinks otherwise. He might actually not even know that she believes that to be the case. She's just crazy. If he obeys the rule of ""don't stick your dick in crazy"", you'll be alright.
* She actually is his girlfriend. Wat? No. That actually kinda doesn't make sense. If she was his girlfriend, whatever that may mean (FWB, SO, whatever) she is right now forcing him into an unneeded ultimatum that she can't win. She's screwing him over, by screwing your relationship up, and she does so consciously. If she's anywhere near sane, she knows that she's fucking their relationship up as well. He chose to keep this hypothetical relationship a secret for a reason, so if she ends up telling you out of no sane reason, she'd be breaking his trust and heart. If she wanted to be exclusive with him, and tried to force you out of it, well, tough luck. Because I'm sure your BF will see through this and run for the hills. See point 2: She must be crazy to even try this.

**TL;DR**: Your SO didn't cheat on you. She's either crazy, or deliberately trying to screw up your relationship, or *both*.

Since you have more insight into the whole situation, (after all you've been there yourself, I have only read your summary of it) feel free to point out any scenarios I have overlooked that worry your, or any other oversights I made. Or anything you wanna talk about, really.

EDIT: Also, please don't judge him behind his back. Or think at all about him while he's incapacitated. He can't explain the situation right now, but communication is key in a relationship for a reason. By making an opinion while he's unconscious, you're making the whole situation harder. If he was conscious, all he'd need to explain the situation likely are 3 sentences or less. So why worry about it for days? (I'm usually in favour of the mentality ""low expectations are good, because you can't end up disappointed"", but in this case that attitude is harmful.)"

Mongoosen42,vegan,1389005747.0,"There are three pillars to my veganism, all of equal personal value.

* The environmental aspect

No way around it, the animal product industry is destroying the planet. It is arguably the greatest driver of global warming.

* The health aspect

Eating animal products kills you. It's not good for you. It causes osteoporosis and clogs your arteries. Animal products are the ONLY source of cholesterol, and despite the propaganda to the contrary, it is not even remotely difficult to meet your protein needs through plant based products alone.

* The spiritual aspect

Killing is wrong. I wish to live a life in which I don't take the life of another creature that is capable of thought and feeling.


All three of these pillars to my veganism is equally important to me. However, being vegan for health and spiritual reasons is a matter of person choice. It is only for the environmental aspect that I would like to see others become vegan as well."

There really shouldn't ever be a point in the game where more than 3 starters are on the bench other than garbage time.

Ezili can fit into that type of scheme just fine, just have to hope Jackson's rotations are more so experimental and come playoff time they're a little tighter.  Mark Jackson has so much flexibility in his lineups that I'm baffled we still see a Douglass-Bazemore-Speights combo at any point outside the 4th quarter.

As much as the Sister Wives (if there's ever a Nerdist band you know what you have to call it) try to derail things I feel like you do manage to rein them in. Most of the time anyway. They're really good at trying to derail things.

You and Craig Ferguson are the only two hosts I know that manage to keep things going while still feeling completely natural and not forced. Not to disparage other hosts or anything since I think a lot of them do a good job with what they're given, but sometimes it feels like they're just waiting for people to finish answering a question so they can ask the next one (or go to commercial) and it just becomes totally artificial. I've never seen any other host be able to go to commercial and have it feel like it was part of the bit, which I appreciate a lot.

It's not like you want to go to commercials or have time constraints on a panel :\"

He kept pushing my head towards his penis, but he was uncircumcised, and that can be a bit unpleasant if the guy isn't straight out of the shower.  I sucked a little, anyway, and then went back to a handjob after my jaw got tired.  While I had given a good number of successful handjobs (and my previous serious boyfriend was uncut, so I knew how), apparently it wasn't good enough for him, and he continued to wordlessly push his dick towards my head or crotch.

It is scary how little these guys seem to care about consent.  I'm not triggered, thankfully, and I just consider it a bad hook-up, but if I had been a bit less ""rude"" things could have turned out very differently."

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389008933.0,"I know the feeling. I genuinely love Dragon Age Origins for example, but I mostly play the main game and then played only the different starting missions. It just isn't enough for me to want to sit through the entire game twice. 

That said, I eventually did do most of a mage and a non-mage playthrough because I felt the gameplay there was sufficiently different to give a bit of a different feeling even during the same parts. 

I look at a game like Long Live The Queen and to me it's almost a bit of a serious version of The Stanley Parable (serious in that the plot isn't just a metaphor for something else) [and I mean the comparison only in regards to choice and paths as the main game elements, they are completely different in all other regards]. It has decent amounts of stacking path variety, but imo everytime somebody mentions they with the game had been twice as long I kind of cringe because imo even though I really liked the story and the setting and wouldn't have minded spending more time in there, the main reason the variety works is because the individual ""runs"" are relatively short, aka you don't have to sacrifice a ton of time just to try something new (and in the case of this game: something that might not even work). Especially with the way the game does long term consequences of stuff that happened very early in the game. 

The thing is that with many games that have choice in the storyline, it usually is still 90% of the gametime the same game and just some differences at the edges. 

That's why imo I feel we should rethink some choice systems really as customization systems. If you take let's say a medieval style fantasy world, there are two to three main fantasies: mage, melee knight and maybe bowman. If you strongly prefer one or the other you want a game that allows you to experience this. And for a company it might actually be cheaper to have a game that allows both a mage fan and a melee fan to be able to play the game rather than let's say create a pure mage game which wouldn't interest the players who prefer melee and wouldn't be bought by them. 

If you look at it from a customization point of view then the only thing that matters is that you get YOUR way. Aka from your POV it wouldn't make the game that much worse if there was no choice at all, it's just that your preferred options came preselected. It's just that it is more convenient for the devs to implement all the ways because it increases the chances that more people will find their way in the game (remember that a lot of games already have to create mage or bowman assets anyway for the enemy variety).

Silence is the least awkward thing there can be between two people. Silence is only awkward when you make it awkward.

Here's a bit of advice: Don't make him talk. When you're with him and there is silence, share the silence. Only ask what he's thinking about once. If he wants to share what he's thinking, he will, especially after your prompt. Only ask him if he's ok if he actually looks distressed.

But I am miles ahead in the black despite some very questionable calls early on - for example, in the recent rise, I have cashed in about half of my portfolio and redirected that into a loan-free real estate investment (which is something I could not have done on my salary alone). 

One of the key attractions of this method, for me, is that it's very low maintenance. I don't have to be glued to the markets daily. I don't have to pore through tonnes of prospectuses and annual reports. I just wait for the crash and then empty my bank accounts.

Daniel123654,AskReddit,1389010092.0,"I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma when I was 14, I started form suffering with night sweats and itchy skin as well as fatigue for around a year before I was diagnosed. Unfortunately I ignored these symptoms and put it down to teenage hormones. When I first noticed something was wrong was when I woke up and noticed a golf ball sized lump just above my left collar bone. I stayed overnight whilst they ran blood tests and other things. Within a week I had had a biopsy of the lump and had been told it was cancer. A fortnight after that I started chemotherapy for 6 months and followed it with a month of radiotherapy.

When I was first told I had cancer I didn't know how to react, I was just about to start my GCSE exams so I guess they helped to take my mind off it. I tried to ignore what was happening and quickly became accustomed to the hospital trips every day , and tried to enjoy school and time with my friends as much as I could during breaks. 

It wasn't until I had finished all my treatment when it started to affect me, I started to feel depressed because I felt I had been robbed of nearly 2 years of my life in total (due to lasting side affects such as weak legs preventing me from going out with friends, and my lack of immune system meaning I was at high risk of getting ill from simple things such as tap water and soft ice cream). I eventually started to feel better afterwards and could continue with a relatively normal teenage life, but I would definitely say that the experience changed me and made me who I am today (for better or worse)."

I get the impression that with a lot of the Amnesia style indie horror games that don't really have the right budget to let's say do supporting characters in a convincing way (since believable looking humans are hard to do) can't really use this horror effect where something feels normal and then the weird stuff creeps in, or where you feel in control at first but then it starts slipping away from you.

keypuncher,conservatives,1389010463.0,"&gt; The left hates old people? Really?

Watch what people do, not what they say.  The left's policies say yes they do.

&gt;  Stanford University no longer requiring people to do a course on ""Western Culture"" is a terrible thing?

When people live in that culture, eliminating the requirement among institutions of higher learning to educate students about that culture is a terrible thing, yes.  ...and Stanford is hardly the only one.

&gt; So ... it is complaining that we don't get our morals from a 2000 year old book, while praising us for having modern morals that have moved on significantly compared to 2000 years ago?

No, it is complaining that the West is attacked as ""uniquely oppressive"" despite having ""gained unprecedented rights and freedoms for women, gays and lesbians, and for individuals in general"".

The 'contempt for the Bible' mentioned in the article is a separate point and is made in conjunction with the other sources of Western culture.  She expands on that point, going on to include ""Homer, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Dickens -- all male, all very white and all undeniably very dead"" - and I've had discussions with liberals who have the same contempt for the Constitution on the same grounds - that it was written 200 years ago by a group of 'old, dead white men' and isn't relevant to the modern day.

&gt; &gt; ""I have little time for people who say that black people cannot relate to books written 2,000 years ago by a bunch of dead white guys""

&gt; ... is it referring to the bible here? Because noone in those stories was white.. Or are we only talking about Homer now?

See above.

&gt; &gt; Dead white men, the pillars of the western canon, remain supremely relevant to black people in the 21st century, because their concerns are universal

&gt; Concerns like how hard to whip your slaves, and what to do with people who work on the Sabbath?

No, concerns like Plato's descriptions of how a government should be run and what happens to those who refuse to participate in it, Virgil's descriptions of early Eminent Domain efforts and poems that tell the myths that are among the foundations of Western culture.  Likewise Dante.  Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Dickens - all writers who had profound influences on Western culture."

1. http://goo.gl/2ReR9V 
This is a discussion about Japan's (negative) population growth, contains mainly discussion about population decline and jokes about the Japanese obsession with robots (using them for sex etc.). Fairly childish, but all light-hearted. A reasonable amount of arrogance and presumption but no direct insults to Japan that I could find. 

2. http://goo.gl/kmLHG 
This is an article about North Korea declaring its target as Japan. Comments are almost entirely centered around the ridiculousness of N. Korean foreign policy.

3. http://goo.gl/SjS7C
This article concerns the devestating earthquake that hit Japan a couple of years back (I'm sure you remember). Comments are entirley made up of updates to the situation, personal experiences and sympathy towards those affected. 

4. http://goo.gl/TCzXLn 
Again concerning the Tsunami/earthquake, this time focussed on an ancient technique which saved lives during the flood. Discussion is focussed on the article, similar examples and some relatively harmless jokes about the uranium being left for much longer, etc. 

Even in this thread there is little to no ""Japan-hate"". The only criticisms towards Japan are focused on its government and whaling policy, and not at its people or the country at a whole.

I'm not discounting all the criticisms that's being said, but there is quite a bit of yellow journalism involved whenever there is a line or two the media can lift out in a book without context.  Especially a media that is inherently racist.  

(My argument that the media is inherently racist against Asians: Look at Amy Chua's photo and the photo that online newspapers use for the 2013 Miss America competition.  Whenever there is a photo of a white person, it's usually nice and pristine.

I feel like the nature of the jerk should dictate the style of the CB post.

Sometimes some initial description/a starter discussion is warranted, and in these cases a paragraph or two can suffice. And sometimes, of course, a novel may be required-- for example in discussion of a macrotrend, series of jerks, something complex enough to need a real writeup, etc. 

I think it's better to fit the post to the jerk than to force the post to fit some arbitrary format. If this means occasional CB2-style posts in the new CB1 regimen, so be it."

Gunungjati,AskMen,1389012894.0,"I used to judge my father for how he / his life affected my life. A little background: 

I don't remember much more then him always having to work and be late for dinner, or not at all. Get recalled from holidays, those kinda things (he was mostly in managing position for bigger IT company's in my country back in the 80's). Other then this it are just memory's of never being good enough. Sure i dropped out of college but got a good job straight away and honestly right now its not really any detrimental for me. I got a solid job and have been for the last 8 years or so.

In the mid 90's he started his own small company which he always made us feel was doing pretty OK. I joined the company in '99 as purchaser and helped with building pc's. Even passed a job i got offered at that time where i would have made nearly double the money and would have gotten my MCSE.

13 dec 2000 he got a stroke and went into a coma till he passed away the 24th. Sure, Christmas basically sucks every year for me now but that's another story.

The company at that point had only my dad, me and the tech guy so it was rough for a bit. I tried my best to push the company forward and doing pretty decent with it being a 23 year old guy who just lost his father. Unfortunately it turned out that it didn't go that well with the company and even tho i managed to increase sales by a good 20% in the first quarter it was just not enough and we had to file for bankruptcy. 

In this time we found out that my father had both a drinking and gamble problem which he had been able to hide pretty good to us. Sure we knew about the drinking and tried to do something about it but that was a mission impossible it seemed. 

So all in all, i can honestly say i have no happy memory's of my father. However i feel like i forgave my dad. Around Christmas i will actually miss him and still shed a tear when i hear ""Father and son"" by Cat Stevens.

 I just remember that no matter how shitty he was to me as a father. He made me who i am as of today. And that is someone i am comfortable with and happy with. "

Frankly_George,funny,1389013944.0,"&gt;The regulations were written way before ""unlimited minutes"" and ""unlimited nights and weekends"" were normal, as a consumer protection against having telemarketers wasting your cell minutes, but they're still on the books.


As someone with a pre-paid cellphone plan which includes only 200 minutes a month this is still a hardship for me. Not everyone can afford to buy a plan with unlimited minutes to have a complete stranger try to sell you scam credit card reduction or ""free"" cruises which come with a fifty dollar ""service fee"" or to be harassed by someone else's bills.

(On that last one - collectors never seem to believe that someone would lose their cell service and some poor schmuck could end up with that number later on having no idea who the hell you're talking about. Worse, once you finally convince there to leave you alone they bundle and resell the bad debt and your phone number to some other collection agency so the fun starts all over again.)

LolaRuns,Games,1389014086.0,"Your question was: 

&gt; Honestly, how many things do this incorrectly?
&gt; 

My answer was to give an example of where it gets done reasonably often. So it's not really something that happens once in a blue moon it's still done relatively consistently. (and yes it can join the ranks of pretty much anything, like let's say, bullet wounds and shootouts also gets portrayed incorrectly a lot)

I gave this as an example for something where the incorrect aka wrong facts depiction is pretty obvious, but there's other genres. Rapey scenes had a long tradition of being used as an excuse to show off skin, particularly of ""virtuous"" characters who the creators thoughts wouldn't show skin normally. They are still used for shock and awe in horror films. They are used in creepy ways in those Lifetime movies of the week for some degree of luridness. They are used in creepy ways in romance novels to faciliate a romantic relationship. They are used in creepy ways in tv shows to establish a character as bad and then the creators reconsider and try to make the character a nice person. I'm pretty sure that pretty much any soap opera ever portrays the legal results/ramifications incorrectly. 

And that doesn't really go into ANY of the supposed metaphysical social justice warrior stuff (aka a bad character becoming nice or a shallow character gaining depth after being raped (used to be done in soap operas), or a rape of a woman being used to give her protector a character arc), these are just bad/lame/cheesy depictions. 

So yes, of course it still gets done ""incorrectly"" at various times. Sure, a lot of it is done by genres that are inherently kinda crappy (like porn or porn games or soap operas or romance novels or supernatural tv shows or lifetime movies). But that's the thing, that video games kinda have a similar reputation of not really being the best at storytelling maybe? "

benk4,smallbusiness,1389014950.0,"I'm an engineer who does quite a bit of design of plastic parts that need injection molding (although I'm not a molder myself!).  Molding parts can get pretty expensive, although there are some cool places that make cheap molds for small runs.   I'd recommend trying www.protomold.com.  I've worked with them and they're pretty good.  I just paid $2500 to have 500 parts about the same size as those run.  That's extremely cheap comparitively, as molds can cost 10's of thousands of dollars.  

The biggest problem I foresee with these is the fact that they are multicolored.  I usually do parts where color doesn't matter, so everything is single color.  My understanding is it's much more difficult to make parts multicolored, and I'm not sure protomold has the capability to do it.  It's worth asking them though!  "
ikkleste,magicTCG,1389014972.0,"Large-Large-Large seems to be the most popular idea here, but aren't they a little wary of large sets? They went from 636 cards a block, via two huge sets leading to a colossal standard that I seem to remember tehy thought was a mistake  (TSP and LOR/SHD) to 539 for a standard large small small block. They did this for a reason, and while they have gone above this up to 642/block for double large set blocks (and a little more for RTR where you added the extra lands too) going to ~750 would seem to be pushing that a little far.

Could it be that you'd maybe see the ""large"" set size of those closer to 180-200 rather than the usual large size of 250 (or the small size ~160)

Opie just threw two *really stupid* interceptions in a playoff game. Not to mention the slide headfirst that ended in a fumble (and on the *next* possession, Andy Dick slides headfirst *again*). Look, Bengals fans have figured out that Andy Dolt just isn't going to take the team to the next level, he's a serviceable quarterback, but he can't handle the pressure in the playoffs. That much is painfully obvious.

I also have some questions for his coach, such as why he didn't go have a conversation with his quarterback about the correct technique when a quarterback decides to slide. And someone has to answer the question as to why they were chucking the ball 30 yards down the field on 4th and 2 at the end of the game.

The Bengals have a lot of problems to sort out and getting the QB position settled is chief among them."

I hardly think this is an issue worth wasting any time on. We can't ban it because of some religions and the fact that there doesn't seem to be any evidence that it causes harm to the child.

1.) Devs themselves running a linux as their working environment aka ""I might as well...""

2.) You are using a non windows based library anyway because you want to be cross compatible with other, more popular platforms like the consoles or most notably Android/Mac and Linux is sort of ""in the package"" with some of those cross platform frameworks (like Unity). 

Some devs still shy away from linux support even if they already have unity because they fear the support effort when people come in with some obscure distro and complain the game doesn't work. 

There also seems to be some factor of big linux fan being very ready to take money into their hands on things like kickstarters or humblebundles. I don't know if that really makes that much of a dent financially, but it seems to increase the reputation of the linux user base. "

This is surely not something you should take into your own hands and should be distributed among other family members, if possible.

As long as you make your half-brother part (even leading) these medical decisions until critical times, it will let him open up to the idea that there really is a team behind him and he's not alone :)

We shouldn't stick him on the left, we should have learned that last season, as he just isn't suited to play on the left. Naughts isn't going to progress any further but can do a job on the right in short term situations. 

In truth, we should probably get our true youth talent out on loan where they can get regular playing time. The regular playing time would benefit them much more than the occasional spot start for us. Especially when you have someone in house who can cover that spot and doesn't need time to develop.

In the summer decide what you are going to do long term, but for now unless you get someone who is desperate for a average backup right back there is no reason to prioritize moving Naughts.

&gt; &gt; When people live in that culture, eliminating the requirement among institutions of higher learning to educate students about that culture is a terrible thing, yes

&gt; Why? You're simply asserting it.

For the same reason that not teaching history is bad.

&gt; This sounds like you're trying to put your own spin on people who just say that the constitution should be modernized or updated. Since the constitution has gone through various amendments, clearly in the past people have felt that it needed to be updated.

The Constitution contains an amendment process for changing it - they were talking about reinterpreting it or throwing it out altogether.

&gt; Why should we care what Plato thought about how a government should be run?

...

No.  Read *The Republic*.  ...and thank you for making my point for me.

Because those myths are part of the culture of which we are all a part.  Separate people from them, and they have less common ground with the people who understand them."

I got some meds through a general practitioner (an urgent care doctor) with very little difficulty, to deal with extreme anxiety directly related to my commute. (I would have marathon-racing heart after driving to college near Washington DC.) 

I don't know how much you know about specific meds. For me, it took a few tries, but I eventually got on Lexapro (a daily med) with an occasional Xanax (to be taken in case of total freakout). Later, I started seeing a psychologist (who can't prescribe meds), and tapered off, then stopped taking Lex at all. I still take a Xanax about once a month, but it's way better than it was before starting meds. 

Talking about it is way better in the long-term, but at least getting on some meds might change your life for the better in the short term.

**TLDR**: You might want to go to an Urgent Care or regular General Practitioner for an anti-anxiety prescription, or talk to a psychologist. If you have insurance, it should pay for nearly all of either option. "

Now (x+a)^(2) = x^(2) + 2ax + a^(2).

So 2a = 4(k-2)/(k+1) -&gt; a = 2(k-2)/(k+1) and a^(2) = 2k/(k+1)

Squaring a = 2(k-2)/(k+1) gives us a^(2) = 4(k^(2) - 4k + 4)/(k^(2) + 2k + 1)

Therefore 4(k^(2) - 4k + 4)/(k^(2) + 2k + 1) = 2k/(k+1)

Multiply both sides by (k+1)^(2) to get:

4k^(2) - 16k + 16 = 2k^(2) + k

Combine terms to get 2k^(2) - 17k + 16 = 0.

People seem to get fixated on the idea that Shelton had gone mad with vengeance and was trying to bring down the entire criminal justice system, even the entire government. They seem to completely overlook what, in my opinion, was the real goal of Shelton, which was to teach Rice (Jamie Foxx) a lesson, which was thus:

That there are some people in this world whose crimes are so heinous, their personalities and lack of conscience so evil that he must do everything in his power to kill them and not give them any chances. No deals for ""a little bit of justice"", they need to be put down at all costs, lest the innocent suffer.

Shelton did this by becoming a heinous criminal. Starting off by just killing his family's murderers and steadily escalating to eventually killing totally innocent people, Shelton was asking Rice, through his actions, of where he will draw the line?

Shelton left a trail for Rice (and his collegues) to find, so that when the time came there would be a(n intentional) ""hole"" in his plan for Rice to exploit. Think about it; Shelton is a ""brain"". The guy who thinks literally 1,000 steps ahead and plans for every contingency. A man who can topple governments. Do you honestly think he didn't factor in Rice finding his bomb and moving it?

That last scene where the bomb goes off and the fire is spreading through the prison, Shelton smiles. It isn't a ""dang, he foiled me!"" smile, it's a ""He's finally learned what needs to be done"" smile. It's a smile of success because he knows Rice will now never give the truly evil any chances. Remember; Shelton's family is dead. He has nothing left to live for. He wanted to die, but he didn't want his death to be meaningless. By showing this one lawyer never to give an inch to men like him, he has possibly saved another man's family from injustice.

TL;DR: Shelton wasn't trying to dismantle the system, he was trying to show Rice that there are some criminals who should never be negotiated with, who should be killed at all costs, by becoming said criminal. He wanted Rice to find the bomb and kill him."

Reality is, all of the Palestinians I've met in Toronto will distinguish very carefully that it's not a ""Jewish"" issue. They don't give a shit if someone's a Jew unless they're a Palestinian-hating ultra-Zionist.

Same goes for the Lebanese, when it comes down to it.
There might be a few people, hangers-on and actual bigots who use pro-Palestinian activism as a way to channel their dislike for Jews on racial grounds or whatever, but these sorts don't seem to be very numerous or mainstream in the pro-Palestinian movement.

On the other side of the scales, Israeli politicians and pundits and their supporters can be as racist and disgusting and quasi-genocidal as they like, and hardly any attention is paid."

1) Do not write the notes on the sheet music, force yourself to painfully read them each time.  The crutch of reading it as ""A plus two pitches"" isn't really that bad initially... stick with that until you start to internalize it

2) This might be fairly obvious but try to keep in mind reference notes to start counting from.  For example, the two dots in the bass clef center around F.  I also memorized where C was in bass clef first.  Then you can start counting relative to those pitches as a crutch.

3) Flash cards.  On one side, have a clef and a single note, on the back have the pitch and octave (e.g. A4, G2).  Go through the cards a few times a day when you have a moment of down time.

4) Most importantly... practice practice practice!  It will come but it might take a while.  It's taken me quite a while."

Right before Christmas, my boyfriend proposed to me (yay!) which then transitioned into a lot of holiday parties to show off a ring, it was a lot of fun. It also meant we were combining holidays for the first time. I scheduled everything out so we would have about equal and adequate time with all families, however his family kept changing the time around so we didn't spend as much time as we would like with them, and more time with my family, so drama central all around with that. There were tears, and fights, I'm pretttttyyy sure his dad now hates me. 

However I did get to spend an absolutely lovely day drinking too much wine with my grandma and chitchatting. It was so nice.

I can say clearly, as a man, and with the vast majority of my friends and associates being men, that there's no talk of the ""friendzone""-- I don't remember even hearing the term come up in regard to it being a solid theory or something that actually exists.

As I said above, this article is essentially projecting the idea of the ""friendzone""-- or talking about men putting women in the ""girlfriend zone"", and pulling out all the usual third-wave rubbish about the nasty objectifying childish men waving their cocks around and not respecting women, even though this is all third-wave projection and essentially pissing in the wind.

It's basic human nature. When you develop feelings of a certain sort towards someone who's your friend and of the opposite sex, and those feelings aren't requited for whatever reason, then it's not ""lol I just wanted to fuck you"". 
There are numerous reasons as to why a man wouldn't want to be around a woman who he's talked about certain feelings towards her which she doesn't reciprocate. I can imagine one of the lesser effects would be a sense of supreme awkwardness after you've expressed yourself or whatever, and who wants to be in that position?

I know if it were me I wouldn't want to be around the woman for at least a while just because it would feel so off, for lack of a better word. Not because I just wanted something to stick my dick into-- that's what the archetypical inebriated meet is for, although the third wavers are trying to piss all over that as well."

duggtodeath,WTF,1389019544.0,"&gt; I like how you claim I'm racist for posting facts

You didn't post any ""facts."" Get over yourself. You show a racist bias in most of your top-voted comments. Science is about riding oneself of bias to come to a conclusion. You can in with a racist hypothesis, then cherry-pick data to fit your narrow worldview.

&gt; yet you end each of your posts with a racist comment derogatory to blacks.

Like you care about sub-human mud people.

&gt; I think you need some critical thinking skills. You comments come off as an uneducated 12yr old with an inferiority complex.

Look who is talking. You are claiming that by winning the genetic lottery, you are racially superior to other people. As if when being born you asked your genes ""Don't let me be black."" You then patted yourself on the back for choosing the ""right"" color. Nigga, are you for real? You didn't present any facts. Because facts would destroy your irrational belief. You are a racist apologist. You wait for race-baiting posts to let your beliefs be known. You aren't original. All racists sound the same."

So for example, every Monday at 5 there will be a mod or bot post where everyone who wants to talk about relationships or dating can post and have a free discussion and then the next day this will be replaced by a post on clothing, sex, fitness or any other frequent topic that people feel is taking up a bit too much space on the front page. 

Also the community could maybe have some sort of vote on a topic that will be discussed in a similar way, with people choosing from a list of typical subjects and titles such as fashion, sport, cooking or any topical events that are happening at that time. The FAQ Friday post seems like a good thing to build on, but I'd be more in favour of a slightly more structured setup to get things back to a more open and wider debate.

But consider that the country (and presumably the culture) in question is actively and aggressively patriarchal and fairly misogynistic. If males are being abused, they are far less likely to say anything about it, and so they are rarely considered when it comes to abuse. This is sad seeing as there are probably males being abused in any given country at any given time, no matter how small the percentage. But if they don't come forward, they can't be counted. Thus the perceived notion of ""special consideration"". It's more like ""this seems to be the only group of people needing to be considered"".

I think the current security is what a reasonably-minded person would have. A few firearms, dead drops, a CCTV system. However, the steel bars and steel doors would be a little too much for me. I personally wouldn't do them if it were me. Steel bars on the windows could lower property value if he plans to sell it in the future. Steel doors to separate the house just sounds expensive. Are the doors electronic? Are they closed manually?

However extreme, I don't think the extra security is unreasonable. The CCTV and firearms serve completely different purposes than the steel bars and doors. Steel bars and doors keep people out of areas. CCTV only records what's going on, and does not benefit you one bit until your house is clear after a burglary. Firearms protect you, but only if you can get to them.

I think there's a few other areas of security I would take care of before going for the expense of the bars and doors. Does he have a large dog? (Or a couple if it's a big house) Does he have an alarm system? How about an alarm system sign? Or motion activated flood lights? Do you have shubberies that would conceal someone trying to break in?

I agree that a lot of fear mongering goes on, especially when talking about home security. Not only by vendors selling the products, but also the news - because that's what gets good ratings. But, I don't think most people need expensive, extreme case security systems.

A lot of home security is simply looking like a harder target than everyone else. Burglars are typically going to go for the easiest targets. You don't have to swim faster than the shark - just faster than the guy next to you."

crayolajunkie,52weeksofcooking,1389020268.0,"I hodge-podged a couple of recipes I found online, but here’s roughly what I did and what I used. 



**Ingredients:** 

* 2 Medium Russet Potatoes - Shredded

* 3 Tablespoons Butter, melted (I would cut this down to 2) 

* 3 Slices of Bacon

* 1 Handful of Spinach

* 4 Eggs

* 1 Cup of Milk

* 1 Cup (Plus a pinch for the crust) of Cheese; I used Italian Style Mix

* Salt &amp; Pepper to Taste 


*Normally I would use chopped onion and garlic with the spinach/bacon mixture, but I didn’t have any on hand, so they didn’t get used.* 
 


**Steps:** 

1. Shred potatoes and put in bowl of water to soak for a bit. Preheat oven to 400F. 
Note: I did mine overnight out of necessity, but I would at least rinse them to get some of the starch off/out

2. Dry potatoes out as much as possible. I did this by putting them in a dish towel and twisting it to compress them, but you could also line a strainer with towels and press on them from the top. Get out as much water as possible so that the potatoes will get crispy when you cook them.

3. Put the shredded potato in a 9 inch pie plate and add in the melted and slightly cooled butter, a pinch of whatever cheese you’re using, and salt &amp; pepper to your liking. Mix ingredients &amp; then pat the shreds into a crust shape. 

4. Put the crust in the oven for about 20 minutes or until it looks par cooked, but not super crispy. When the crust is done, turn the heat down to 350F. 


5. Chop up bacon and fry until almost cooked, whatever crispiness level you prefer, and then add in the spinach until wilted. Remove pan from heat and set to the side to cool.  (If you’re using onion &amp; garlic I’d add the onion in with the bacon and garlic in when you add the spinach)

6. Mix three eggs and milk in a bowl. Stir in the cheese and your cooled ingredients from the pan. Add S&amp;P to your liking. 

7. Pour the mixture into the prepared crust and return to the now 350F oven for 30 minutes, or until it has a night light brown color and the crust looks crispy. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes and then dig in!

One thing I would change for next time is that I would put the crust in at 450F, but for a shorter time to get more of a crisp on the bottom of the crust, which had a nice crisp &amp; color, but got slightly soggy from the egg mixture. 

I hope you enjoy it if you try it.

He is probably not gay, he's just at this age where he wants to figure out what he likes and what not. Watching porn is a way to investigate different styles and it may not even be what he's into but just his curiosity. It may be this week gay porn and next week he'll look into African-Americans banging Asian chicks and the week after he'll look into DP and I don't know what else is out there. It's probably partly motivated by the thrill of the forbidden and partly because he's curious and wants to learn what's out there. 

You know what /u/Asteroid- ? You mention your and his age somewhere in the thread and without wanting to be condescending of your age and maturity, my first thought is, you two are so young in years lived, you don't need to commit in such a serious manner yet.

I assume you're each others first serious long term relationship and with those it is so hard to quit. We are taught in the movies and by our parents how relationships should work (everlasting, happy ever after, yadda, yadda) but we're not taught how good it is to break something up and start something new and how to do it in a non-hurtful manner. 

Your youth is there to learn and find out what you really want by adding good and bad experiences. This way you learn what you really want. You will add more of the good stuff and avoid the bad stuff. In your early 20s, there's no way you can have gained this experience already - you'd miss out on so much in your life. 

So maybe what you need to do is to check your own feelings. Figure out for yourself, without putting any blame on him, if that guy, as sweet as he his, is still the right guy for you or if you wouldn't rather be with someone who is excited for you?"

I moved out of state for college and, as much as I tried, my friends from home stopped being close to me. The college I went to was really big and had no campus, so it was hard to meet people there. 

Recently I had a personal, traumatic event happen to me and I didn't have one 'friend' to rely on or even speak to. It was unbelievably painful, and being alone was almost as bad as the event itself.

I have tried to inspire myself by remembering that you can only ever rely on yourself, regardless of circumstances. I would like to have someone to talk to, to go out and have fun with, but like my family said I can't just walk around upset and bitter.

directive0,electronics,1389020799.0,"Oh man, so much love for these things. A few years out of high school and this was my first example of indie-funding I was ever involved with and got me into electronics.

I managed to grab one through G1G1. I was super intrigued by the inline voltage sensor in the TRS jack that I blew out the zener diode playing around with it before I understood basic electrical theory. I took it too my EE friend and we managed to get schematics from the OLPC team and even some advice on how to repair it that required some correcting on our end, we added that info back into the wiki when we were finished. I remember pouring over those schematics and just being so intrigued by the symbols and concepts. I decided the following year to get my mechatronics certification almost entirely due to the concepts this device taught me. And what a refreshing change to have a computer that was clearly DESIGNED with user-servicing in mind.

What a thrill that was, it is incomparable to the ownership of any other piece of electronics that I can remember. The forums and the community surrounding it were so inclusive and represented all levels of proficiency. Then using different Sugar and XFCE installs so I could use it like a real computer. That awesome dual mode screen that I am STILL waiting to see in a production device anywhere.

Such a neat little computer, and it taught me so much about electronics and linux. I regret getting rid of them, despite their totally wacky appearance they were GREAT little devices. It was also interesting how much discussion the ideology surrounding OLPC managed to create, people either love or hate the concept. I will have to grab one again someday."

deathadder99,dragonage,1389021501.0,"I'm going to have to disagree with the post above me here. Yes - arcane warrior IS the best spec in the game - but IT'S BORING AS HELL, and oversimplifies the game because you can just face tank anything. My tips as a two handed warrior are to take the Templar Specialisation and get Two Handed Sweep asap. This will give you a good amount of CC and damage. 

2H warriors are also skill spammy since a lot of their DPS comes from activated abilities which basically ignore the swing speed of the weapon, which is why the Chasind Great Maul (purchased from Gorim in Denerim after doing 3 main quests) is the best 2h weapon in the game. Getting bravery and death blow? (the one after bravery that restores stamina on kill) are also great so you can continue to use your actives in combat.

Stats wise, you want to get 16 cunning to max Coercion as QUICKLY as possible - one of the most important skills in the game to allow you to get things to go in your favour. You want to get 42-44 strength so you can wear Massive Armor (I'm particularly fond of the Knight Commander Armor bought from Faryn in the Frostback mountains with the massive 40% spell resistance. You'll need it, trust me), and pump the rest into dexterity. Dexterity is the best tank stat in the game because it allows you to dodge pretty much every hit, and later on this gets really useful as you can't really out heal the damage some enemies do. A few points in CON and WIL aren't too terrible though.

I would HIGHLY recommend taking the heal and regeneration spells on whichever mage you want to bring, they are incredibly useful. Regeneration does a surprising amount of healing over time, and also there is a spell combo where if you heal someone with regeneration on them it increases the effect. Cone of cold is another great spell and a guaranteed freeze on most enemies including bosses.

EDIT:
ALSO - Keep Indomitable active AT ALL TIMES. It's the best warrior skill in the game imo as it protects against so many knockdowns and stuns which would spell certain death for you!"

Both deaths. Upon consuming the fruit, Adam and Eve experience spiritual death (making the temporal sphere corrupt), and by doing so, allowed physical death into the world. That is why Christ is needed, to overcome both spiritual and physical death.

It was not, though. Without death, evolution doesn't make since.

I live in a major city, and I'm in the middle of a big career change which could take me anywhere. So I'm having fun being single and dating instead of compromising what I want for a girlfriend.

Honestly, four months into dating is when you should start evaluating whether you want a relationship or not. Four months is not a very long time to get to know someone. I've known people who exposed a serious addiction or personality flaw long after four months. At four months, it's reasonable to evaluate whether the relationship has long term potential, and move on if it doesn't."

Someone else recommended you get the ground wire looked at by a tech, which isn't bad advice and that will probably solve the problem, but depending on how cheap your instrument is, you might want to just deal with it for now and upgrade when you can.

My very, very first electric guitar was a Squire Bullet (I recently gave it to my brother when he got Rock Smith).  It was the cheapest thing ever, but I understood that when I bought it.  I got the thing in high school when I was poor and I wasn't sure if I would even keep playing guitar.  The thing would buzz horrendously when I would touch anything metal while it was on my lap and plugged in.  The thing cost about $120 (USD) and I knew it wasn't worth the money it would cost to get it repaired or set up. "

Daiteach,community,1389022762.0,"Objectively:

- Under new management, the show was under incredibly scrutiny. When the show was lame, flat, unfunny, wobbly, or unfaithful to the characterizations - as most shows are from time to time regardless - everybody noticed.

Subjectively:

- This is more subjective, but I think the show was different and not as good during season four. I still watched every episode as it aired, but it was not as good. That doesn't mean that the best parts of season four aren't good, or that there aren't weak and wobbly parts of other seasons (especially three). I do think it was weaker overall, though. In particular, the show lacked the constant brilliance that permeates most of the earlier seasons. (I know this sounds like selective memories; I'm basing this on rewatching the whole series prior to season five.) The joke density is just lower, and the brilliant joke density is much, much lower.

- The show was stuck delivering on things that it didn't necessarily know how to handle, including Jeff meeting his father, Jeff graduating, Chase leaving the show, and so on, and it kind of bunted on a lot of those plot points. The one place where they actually took a real swing,  dealing with the weird spot season three had left Chang in, I think they whiffed pretty hard, and I think they could tell they were whiffing hard enough that the whole plot point just kind of sputtered around for a while weakly before it was kind of just dropped.

- This is a big one for me personally, but I feel like season four didn't understand why Community does genre parodies and alternate formats. It's not just something Community does because it's a weird show. ""Puppet episode"" isn't a Community episode concept on its own. It's something Community would do, but it would do something with it, rather than just kind of coasting on the idea that a puppet episode is enough of an idea on its own.

- I really felt like the characterizations were off. Community's characters, like the characters in most shows, evolve over time (or arguably devolve in some cases), but felt flat and off in a lot of places in season four, or reduced to fewer character traits. 

- One thing that Community is generally really good at is pushing wackiness exactly where it needs to push wackiness in order to maximize humor. Troy is impossibly dumb as much as is required for it to be hilarious. Abed views reality in an unusual light as much as is required for it to be hilarious. But the show doesn't stretch reality for its own sake; it does it in the service of jokes or in the service of telling stories in an interesting way. Season four frequently feels like it gets weird for its own sake.

I think that season four of Community was a fairly good season of television with some significant issues. It's not all bad, nor is everything preceding it all good. There are tons of hilarious lines in season four, it's just *off* in a lot of ways."

In the case of Plan B, there's a threshold effect.  Rather than just being in more pain, as with ibuprophen, there is an insufficient concentration of key chemicals in your uterus to prevent ovulation, fertilization, and/or implantation.

LolaRuns,Games,1389022895.0,"&gt;What is relevant is that it's got wide release and distribution.

I'm no expert but that presumably was because it was really good (and everybody loves lesbians). NC17 films still have a huge problems getting wide distribution even if this film presumably had it less. 

The setup was to contrast fully clothed hugging in Mass Effect with that movie. Err, maybe because Mass Effect was trying to keep its rating low the same way tons of other games or movies do? If Blue had it oh so great why are there still tons of movies shooting for a PG13? 

And what the consensual sex scenes of an NC17 rated independant/small scale romance movie have to do with the non explicit rape themes of a Triple A action video game is beyond me anyway. Non sequitur much? 

Because some NC17 rated arthouse type romance movie had explicit lesbian sex scenes we should have rape in a Triple A action game? TF? How are these only remotely related?

For the record, I'm neither for nor against the concept (again, Phantasmagoria had a visibly seen sex scene with the main protagonist as the victim ages ago) but this kind of reasoning is idiotic. "

Thus, if your only sexual activity is fapping (large majority of Fapstronauts), you will end up linking this pleasure to masturbation, and that's where things go wrong... I'm not sure of the scientific accuracy of the ""your brain on porn"" website, but the basis seem legit.

ballookey,exjw,1389023252.0,"I faded in the United States without much trouble at all, however I saw much of what other people describe happen with others in my congregation or in other local congregations.

Partially it comes down to locality. If you're in Australia or New Zealand, all of this difficulty is going to seem incomprehensible because I've noticed that the JW's haven't been able to break up family ties in those areas like they do elsewhere. Culturally Aus &amp; NZ seem to be immune from the worst of the JW's.

Great Britain seems to come in second, but still has it's hardcore zealots that make life difficult for leavers.

The US is probably the *absolute worst* for those wanting to leave the JW's. The US is prone to a certain vicious streak amongst it's most fundamental of the fundamentalists and the JW's appeal to some of those. 

In a country where Westboro Baptist Church exists, a sizable portion of the population thinks slavery wasn't such a bad thing, and who think freedom *from* religion is why god sends hurricanes…the JW's in such a country are going to be more fervent.

That said, that's just the worst of the US and probably not the majority. As I said, I had it somewhat easy due to a history of a tepid relationship with my parents and a local group of elders not given to extreme control issues. I left and no one hounded me about it. But two congregations over, with some control-freak elders and with a different set of parents? I might have had a horrible time leaving.

That's just how uneven the JW's are in actual practice. "

Personally, I lean more toward guys (probably a 4 or 5 on the [Kinsey Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale)), but I do still find women attractive, and sometimes date them, so I call myself bisexual.

Some bi people go through phases of attraction too (aka, the ""bi-cycle""). They may find themselves more attracted to women for a while, then find that attraction shifting toward men, then possibly somewhere in-between. Not saying this is the case with you - only you know for sure where you fit in the spectrum - but it is something to consider."

I don't know what devs tell people when they come with an obscure hardware problem other than update your drivers. And I guess most of them still think of this as the chance that if one person on Win is affected by this maybe there are more people affected by this. While with a problem on an obscure distro is like a percentage of a percentage of an already small percentage. 

Now, I fully agree that the fact that the kind of people who run obscure linux system are more likely to know their shit and let's say will know what to do when you ask them to send them a logfile makes life for people easier, but to my knowledge this was still the reason given by some companies (wasn't it gog even?) that they are worried about the support effort because they can't just install every distro a bug gets reported on.

Step 2: Use the casual numbers as justification for more companies to be Steam OS compatible 

Step 3: Harcore follows because there's now enough games

Fat people don't even get to do *that* without people challenging them for it. The model in these pics is not promoting obesity. All she's doing is taking pictures of herself, and everyone's tearing her a new one for it. As if by appearing in a photograph, she's promoting anything at all.

&gt;In the US we instill a huge stigma around smoking in kids from a young age and we've seen huge decreases in smoking rates as a result. For some reason we're unwilling to go after obesity with the same fervor. 

That's probably because smoking is worse for you than obesity. Smoking kills 400,000 smokers per year in the US; obesity related deaths are lower than that. Furthermore, smokers also kill 50,000 *non*-smokers each year through secondhand smoke...obesity doesn't do that. There is no such thing as secondhand obesity. The only person whose health is damaged by obesity is the obese individual. Smoking damages your body in ways that being fat does not - it's far more toxic to your whole body. Which is probably why there's more fervor where smoking is concerned: because it's worse for individual and public health."

You also haven't been together very long and have made no solid commitment to each other. That's a bit cart-before-the-horseish, isn't it?

Before you say yes to such a crazy plan, seriously and deeply consider WHY you personally want or should have a child. And think about those reasons and what they mean.

A child isn't a bunch of happy camera-ready moments and family love. He or she is another human being with all the potential and problems and needs anyone else has. Don't drag someone into this life without serious thought about what that would mean for you **and for them**."

Blindocide,DebateReligion,1389026050.0,"my question is whether or not we actually choose.

sure, we have what I consider the incredibly stubborn, persistent and convincing illusion that we are what chooses, but that doesn't necessarily get us anywhere.

tangential: ""I think, therefore I am"" makes the implicit assumption that you are the one that thinks. It ends up being ""there are thoughts"", which is good enough for what it was trying to do (prove that some things existed definitively) but doesn't really help us with the whole ""us"" thing.

I guess, to put it simply, in the scheme of particle calculations moving around because of previous states of particle calculations in a deterministic system, there isn't room for this ""will"" or ""choice"" that you speak of. 

Also, since future states already exist (B-Theory of time, and all that), it doesn't look to me like I could ""choose"" any other option at any other point in time.

In fact, using the same descriptive and capable-of-predicting mathematics of physics, we can perfectly describe the events of your morning (you woke up-&gt; put on clothes -&gt; gave yourself calories)  and can just as easily be turned around to perfectly describe the events of your morning in reverse (you take the calories out of you -&gt; take your clothes off -&gt; get back into bed), and there is nothing in those mathematics that gives us any sort of indication as to which one is correct.

&gt;A lot of the effects you describe should be temporary

Depends on your definition of temporary and what inflation targets for the currency as a whole are.  Gold and the Euro are workable models here too.  If Eurozone inflation was say, 4% but spain and greece were really running 1% while germany was running 6 you'd  have a rebalance happening.  'Temporary' in the sense of trying to make up for a 25% valuation difference could take 5 years of of a disaster happening *and* requires high inflation targets which rich countries would tend to object to.  Meaning you could be looking at 'temporary' as in 1 or 2% a year, so in 10 or 15 years they might get close, and then some other economic shock could happen which unwinds the whole thing.


&gt;as feedback loops would cause adjustments in policy in different governments.

Negative feedback spirals don't really support your argument, and those are definitely real things we need to watch out for because they are exactly what happens.  An asymmetric shock hits - even countries that were  being fiscally responsible (which includes spain and greece btw. despite what the germans would tell you), because they cannot rebalance fast enough they end up making cuts which undermine their economy making it harder to rebalance while they end  up in a downward spiral.


The other option to look at is something like the United States, which is a collection of disparate economies all sharing the same currency.  The trick there is fiscal integration - quite a lot of spending happens at the federal rather than local or state level, so when an asymmetric shock hits the federal government either directly or indirectly ends up sending extra money in to lessen the shock (through disaster relief and social assistance).  The  UK system before devolution was inherently superior, in that there were  no provincial or state governments and the single federal government was quite a bit larger relatively as a result.  That meant that the rebalance from asymmetric shocks could happen faster.    The Canadian solution is an unnecessarily complicated transfer payment system where provinces all send money to a pot to spread around amongst each other separately from  federal government spending, but under federal control... because we like math.  Or something.

partspace,nightvale,1389026150.0,"Cecil has no canon appearance. After all, how many of us often describe how we look? When he is described, it's vague, ""neither tall nor short, neither thin nor fat."" So everything the fans have come up with about how he looks is completely their own interpretation.

As to the third eye, I think it's popular for a few reasons. A third eye is weird, a sign of the supernatural and paranoia in Night Vale. According to Wiki, ""The third eye (also known as the inner eye) is a mystical and esoteric concept referring to a speculative invisible eye which provides perception beyond ordinary sight."" So that fits.

More importantly, without the third eye, Cecil is just a guy. The third eye marks him as Cecil the character, rather than another drawing of a random man. You see a guy with a third purple eye, you know *instantly* who he is, especially when there are so many interpretations of Cecil. The purple is also a signifier of WTNV, since that's the color in the logo.

kornberg,relationship_advice,1389026370.0,"You're not the boss of him. He can hang out with whoever he wants to and right now, he wants to hang out with his lady. You need to make more and new friends. This guy has repeatedly shown you that he is more committed to his partner than he is to you--that is how it should be. If he's serious about her, we're talking about his future wife/mother of his kids--that's a relationship that your friendship will never come close to. 

I know it sucks--I hate when my friends drop me for their bf/gf but the fact is that it happens to everyone. When you're in a couple, you want to be a couple and other people are not as important in terms of the time you spend. Don't be mad at him--just accept that he has different priorities right now and occupy yourself with other things and people. 

As you get older, this is going to happen with every single one of your friends. They are all going to couple up and not have the time or inclination to hang out every day. Then they are going to get married and make babies and you're not going to see your friends for weeks on end. That is what happens when you grow up. You can deal with it or not but it's not going to change a damn thing.

The important thing about a wedding is making it meaningful. I suggest the two of you sit down and think about what it means to get married, and what it would take to make the day you commit to each other a meaningful, beautiful memory for you both.

The thing is, getting married isn't really just about the two people. It's about uniting two families. It's about sharing a special moment in your lives with the people who love you and want to support you in your decisions. It's about celebrating connection and family and love with all of those people.

Now, it depends on a lot of factors how many people you involve in this, but marriage is about compromise. The very first test of your married life can be to see how the two of you bridge the distance between your two notions of what a wedding ought to be, to find a happy medium that suits you both. "

LolaRuns,Games,1389027240.0,"But wasn't the fact that it was big and graphic a big reason why it was considered exploitative? And why it is held up as such an extreme example over gazillions of other also crappy depictions that weren't as explicit. 

We are talking about: 

&gt;The game includes an audio file in which a female character is sexually assaulted by male characters; while there is no visual depiction, sounds of ripped clothing and struggle can be heard. 

How is it a more fair comparison to compare this to a movie with an extreme rape scene? It seems to me both comparisons are pretty off base (at this point, since we don't know what exactly it will be like in the game, how much time it till take, how much detail there will be to it, ie, if it cuts out, how long it plays, how integral it is to the plot, as an audio log maybe it will be completely optional background info etc). It could be anything from the agressors describing in lurid detail what they plan to do to her, to them just coming in, her screaming no, no and then only sounds of struggle. 

Without this knowledge, at this point, it sounds more like, I dunno, your average serial killer flick or law and order episodes where they stumble across a tape with a rape or snuff film on it and play it off screen. "

gazork_chumble_spuzz,bodyweightfitness,1389027553.0,"Sorry it took me so long to get back to you about this! I now have two routines, my old one and my new one. They're pretty similar; I redefined my goals and reworked my routine accordingly.

Here's my old one:

Day 1

Russian Twists, 2 sets of 20 slow ones and 2 sets of 20 fast ones

Incline Pushups, 2 sets of 20 (I use my stairs for the incline)

Stair Step-ups, 2 sets of 12; for these, I wear a backpack full of heavy books. I stand at the bottom of my stairs, place one foot three steps up, and then slowly step up until I can put both feet on the same step, and then lower myself back down slowly. I stopped doing them for a while after a knee injury and haven't tried them since September.

Planks - 2 reps; hold for 1 minute.

Calf Raises, 2 sets of 30; I stand on the edge of a stair and leg my heels hang off, and raise myself up and down on the balls of my feet.

Pillow Situps, 2 sets of 15; I lie facedown on the floor with a pillow under my pelvis (it's very bony), bracing my feet against the wall; with my hands behind my head, I do situps using my back muscles to raise my shoulders and torso up off the ground and then lowering it back down. 

Squats. I have a variety of squats that I like to do. Sometimes I lean against the wall and squat that way; sometimes I put on my weighted backpack and stand on one leg, get into a 45-degree squat, and just hold it. I never, ever squat all the way down so that my butt is almost on the ground; my knees would never forgive me. The furthest down i ever go is into a sitting position, so my knees are at a right angle. If I do that slowly my knees can handle it.

Bam Bams, 2 sets of 15 slow reps. I love [these](http://fitnesstreats.tumblr.com/post/4741330647/bam-bams-from-marc-laurens-book-you-are-your-own). They make your butt look amazing!



Day 2

Hip-ups, 2 sets of 10 per side; I lie on the floor on one side, with my torso propped up on one elbow, and my feet braced against something like the wall, and I slowly raise my hips up off the floor so that my body forms a straight line from my neck to my ankles. This one's brutal, for me anyway!

L-sit practice for 5 minutes: I have a chinup bar that I put on the floor and use for these exercises. I do shrugs, I curl my legs up and practice just holdiing my body weight up off the floor, and I do dips off the edge of my futon (metal frame is easy to hold on to!); I also practice getting my body into a proper L-sit posture even though I can't yet get my feet on the ground. Gold Medal Bodies has an amazing L-sit tutorial and I tried to pattern my practice around it.

Bam Bams again, same number of sets and reps

Little piggies, 2 sets of 20. These are murder - you stand on the edge of a step, balanced on your heels, and raise your toes/the front part of your foot up and down. It fills in the front of your calves, and if you do it without holding on to anything (I can't yet) it whips your balance into shape.

Chinup practice, 2 sets of 12, one with underhand grip and one with overhand grip. I can't do chinups yet. I can't even do it if I kip. So I do ""negatives"" instead...I hold the bar and jump up, and when I get to the top I slowly lower myself down. I've really slacked off with these, to my chagrin, but when I was doing them regularly I got strong enough (in about 9 weeks, too!) that i could actually do one chinup if I kipped. If you could see how thin my arms are you'd understand why that made me so excited! lol

My new routine is pretty similar, but I haven't tried it yet so I don't know how it'll work out. I added a couple things to day 1 - I want to learn handstands but I'm too weak and I get a major head rush (and pinprick bruises around my eyes...) if I try to do it the normal way, so I was told to try something else. I'm planning to get into downward dog and get used to that position, and add a few sun salutation pushups to it for fun. As i progress I'm going to slowly elevate my feet while staying in downward dog, and hopefully I will eventually get to the point where I'm doing a real handstand. It's going to take some time, but eventually I want to be able to do an unsupported handstand and maybe even walk on my hands. I also decided to up the ante with my planks and do a 30 day plank challenge - 30 days to go from holding a plank for 1 minute to holding it for 5 minutes. My body is cringing just thinking about it, but I think I can do it. I eliminated the Stair Step-Ups because until I find out what's wrong with my knee I should probably take it a little easier on it than that. I added bridges as well...I am a belly dancer and my back isn't as flexible or as strong as it needs to be, so I added bridge practice to both days. I'm going to start with holding the bridge for just 10 seconds and work my way up to holding it for one minute, then two, then three.  

Day 2 changes: I added handstand practice and the plank challenge; I eliminated hip ups for now, because doing L-sits works your abs pretty well; I added scissors (lying on your side, lifting your leg up and down like a pair of scissors) but I haven't tried them so that may change; and I added bridge work. 

Anyway, I apologize again for the 8 days of not replying. It's been a whirlwind of a holiday and this is the first day I really feel like we're settled back into our routine. I hope this stuff is helpful and that you're able to find a routine that is easy on your back and knees. There are a ton of books and websites out there, full of resources. Good luck!"

kornberg,relationship_advice,1389028921.0,"You don't sound like you want this and you don't sound like you think you're ready for it. For contrast, my best friend just had her first kid. She and her husband have been married for 7 years, together for 10. They bought a house 5 years ago with the intention of having kids in that house. It's down the block from a good school and the layout is good for a kid to live in. The improvements they've made, the cars that they've bought and paid off and the career decisions both of them have made all were made with the intent of having a kid. She makes $42K a year and he is going to be the stay at home dad. 

You guys can't even afford or save up for your own place, how do you expect to comfortably be able to have a kid? Who is going to watch the kid when you're both at work? I don't know where you live but where I live, average cost of childcare for a baby is $20,000 a year. That doesn't include anything else, that is just paying for another human being to watch your kid while you're at work. You can't get your own place with 2 incomes already, do you think you can do that after lighting $20K on fire?

People will say that you're never ""ready"" to have a kid and to a point, that's true. However, you can be prepared and ready to a certain point and you two are not anywhere near prepared and ready to have a kid. Move out of his parents house, get married, plan for it and wait a year and *then* have a kid. You both will be happier, your kid(s) will grow up happier and they'll have a much better chance of succeeding in life. If you guys had a kid now, you'd actually be hurting his or her chances for a successful life in the future. 

You tell him by saying ""Steve, it makes me really happy that you love me and are committed to building a life together but it bothers me that you think that now is a good time to have a kid. We're not prepared or ready to have a kid--financially or emotionally. I'm not going anywhere, there's no rush so let's enjoy our relationship and build a secure future for us and our kids before we start actually having them.""

He may be feeling insecure or like you guys need to have a kid so you'll stick around. Reassure him that you're in this for the long haul and that you want to build a solid foundation with him before jumping off of the proverbial bridge together. It would also be a really good thing if you went and found a breakdown of the annual costs of raising a kid in your area--include childcare, clothes, medical care and obvious things like that but don't forget things like an increase in utility usage, the difference between a 1 bedroom apartment and the larger space you'd need if you had a kid and other hidden costs of being responsible for a third person in your life. Showing him the math, in black and white, may snap him back to reality. 

Regardless, please please please be careful with your birth control. If you're on the pill, keep them somewhere he can't get to. If you rely on condoms, do not let him have access to those. Some people can get so hung up on baby making that they will sabotage birth control--women are accused of ""trapping"" men by sabotaging birth control but men do this too. It's most commonly referenced in abusive relationships, as a way to trap a battered woman more thoroughly into the abuse but it's not unheard of for an otherwise normal couple to have a guy who sabotages the birth control. Please protect yourself and your future children's future.

pamplemus,changemyview,1389028925.0,"while i agree with some of your points, it seems like maternity leave is somewhat of a necessity in order to promote gender equality in the workplace. without maternity leave, it would be almost 100% impossible for women to have a job and children, whereas men would be able to easily have both of those things with no repercussions. btw, i live in america where maternity leave is not always long and sometimes unpaid. plus, childcare is often very expensive, making it not an option for many couples."

Start checking your range with the mortar from about 500 yds (or whatever unit it uses) out, and unload as soon as the target circle goes red over the forts at max range, then basically just circle the island when you get in range for round shot to avoid return fire and going back and forth with mortars. Once you get some of the ship upgrades, fort battles are fairly easy even in the south.

Even if I did meet any who weren't pathetic or deluded, I have to say I still wouldn't agree with the anarchistic worldview.

&gt; Are you saying that Class Struggle isn't a real thing?

In terms of people who are convinced that society is forcing drug addicted transients to be drug addicted or homeless?

Or saying that the screwed-up people who are perpetually on welfare for generations are perpetual victims and not responsible for anything?

No, I don't.

I think that there was plenty that had to be and was addressed as society in general became more urbanized and more technologically advanced. I think that it should be possible for anyone who works hard to be able to achieve decent living standards, especially in nations that are the most affluent have the highest standards of living.

But I think the communist/anarchist narrative of ""everyone but the 'proletariat' is evil and oppressive"" or ""we need to completely dismantle everything about existing society"" to be unachievable and nonsensical.

Change things that are detrimental, sure. Make sure the worst examples of extreme capitalistic irresponsibility are held to account, and develop ways that corporate entities are more accountable in general. 

Hard American capitalism is obviously not the way to go, but capitalism isn't going to go under because some anarchists and hippies and people like that want it to.

I would suggest something with Fipronil in it.  It may take a few months of constant baiting, but it will clear the problem up.  The nice thing about Fipronil is that it uses the domino effect.  Roaches eat the bait and die.  Other roaches will cannibalize the dead and get poisoned themselves, and so on and so on.

I don't do anything physically to prepare except maybe shower.  The doctor doesn't give a fuck what my pubic hair or leg hair situation is.  

I prepare by making sure I have plenty of reading material because I feel like I always wait a fucking *hour* to see the doctor.  I also prepare by making a list of questions or talking points I want to bring up so I don't forget them.  Like, for example, tomorrow I'm having an exam and I need to talk about switching birth controls so I'm making a list of questions, things I need my birth control to do for me, and writing down a timeline of negative side effects that I've experienced with the method I'm using now.

The exam itself is pretty quick.  It typically involves the doctor inserting a finger or two into your vagina while pressing on your lower abdomen with their other hand and then inserting a speculum and swabbing your cervix. The lube they use will most likely be cold and the speculum will be hard and probably also cold so as long as you aren't traumatized by sub-room-temperature objects then you probably don't have too much to worry about.  It's mostly just uncomfortable for a minute or two.  Nothing should really be *painful* but if it is, tell your doctor.  It's all over in under 5 minutes.  Some doctors also do a breast exam but that's gonna depend on your doctor.

From_Mtl,buildapc,1389029444.0,"Most people will comment about wattage, price of electricity, heat generated...

I love gold PSUs because they are quiet. I'm often building HTPCs for friends, and having a quiet unit in one is a major plus. The fan barely needs to spin for most of these high-quality units."

BillygotTalent,soccer,1389029500.0,Indeed. That is also why I think Ter Stegen made it public now. I am fairly certain he told Eberl a longer time ago that he wants to go to Barca eventually and then they figured out the best way for both ter Stegen and Gladbach.

EByrne,nfl,1389029501.0,"I grew up on Bledsoe (Pats drafted him when I was 7), so even for those of us in our late 20s, they've had a good QB at the very least for pretty much as long as we can remember. I barely remember 1990-1991. "
