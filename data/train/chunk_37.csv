imnotminkus,OSU,1390511856.0,"Some of the answers to those questions can change year-to-year (dorm renovations, dining hall changes), the subreddit gets new subscribers, some might not have seen previous posts, etc.  

So it's useful to have updates yearly, but I agree that within the year, there are posts that ask the same question, so a FAQ would also be useful for more factual advice (i.e., ""How do I change my meal plan?"", advantages/disadvantages of each dorm area, advice for bringing a bike to campus) that doesn't change much.  I also think a sticky post or two for the most common timely subjects would be useful (eg. apartment search megathread around the middle of December 'til the end of January).

So, in summary:

* FAQ with common factual info

* Sticky megathreads for timely opinion-based info

I have two Google Docs I've used when giving advice in the freshman Facebook groups each year: one all about textbooks, and another one that has some general OSU advice.  It's scatterbrained and somewhat out-of-date, but I'd be happy to contribute it towards the start of a FAQ."

Zaranthan,DnD,1390511874.0,"For #2, you could probably crib some material from the 3rd edition rules:

http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/cursedItems.htm

There are some neat specific items, and a few tables for variety in your downsides. (I'm fond of ""Character’s hair grows 1 inch longer"" myself.)

 #1 is actually two different problems:

- A: The players are going over everything with a fine-toothed comb.
- B: The players want to take 20 on every roll.

A is often best handled at the campaign level. If the players feel like they're playing a video game where the world just stands around waiting for the party to come poke it, you're going to get the behavior you're complaining about. If they're saving the princess, don't have the BBEG cackling in his tower planning to marry the princess and gain political power. Have the king tell them about the other recent kidnappings where the victims turned up a week later as &lt;insert level-appropriate undead creature here&gt;.

B is a simpler issue of enforcing game mechanics. Checks for information are rolled behind the DM's screen. The players offer their skills and resources, and you give them what they discover. They don't know how well they rolled, and even if they did roll poorly, further attempts to do the same thing return the same result. Some situations allow retries, and you should allow this, but refer back to A. Taking two minutes to pick the lock quietly should be weighed against alerting the enemy by knocking down the door NOW."

Renner1,OneY,1390512838.0,"&gt; But you took the stance that people who dress in ways that are intended to display, and then get mad when they are looked at, are idiots. 

I have to say that unless you're blind or have no common sense, you (in regards to women) ought to realize that a very low-cut top or say spandex yoga pants are going to emphasize, and very much so, certain parts of the body, especially if one does have generous assets in regard to certain parts of the body.

&gt; If they were intending to seek attention, why would they get mad when they received it?

I should clarify, again, that I'm not talking about one of those occasions that are very rare where some boor goes up and slaps them on the ass with no possible invitation to do so, or something along those lines.

I'm talking about some woman dressing in a way that does show off her sexual attributes, sometimes very obviously, and then complains about the ""sexist, objectifying"" men having the audacity to look at her in a certain way. 

&gt; What characterizes clothes that are obviously intended to display, from clothes that are just clothes? 

Tops that are very or extremely low-cut, for one thing. I certainly don't think the only shirts on sale that  are airy or comfortable enough for some women are only the ones that seem to display the maximum amount of cleavage as possible.

Those things that aren't exactly yoga pants, for another. I don't know what they're called but they're in the same shape and design as yoga pants, except made out of the same material as stockings, but shinier. 

I fail to see what purpose those serve, apart from showing off the legs, and especially if they do a very pronounced job of defining other areas as well.

I mean, I prefer to see that infinitely more then those idiotic ""skirts"" that are hardly longer then a pair of panties, or boy-shorts or other things that are really only appropriate at the beach-- but I still don't see many other purposes of something semi-translucent and extremely form-fitting."

ApolloX-2,islam,1390512980.0,"I think of the Prophets marriage to Khadijah and how he was 25 years old and she was 40, a widow, and his employer. He had very little money and was hesitant to marry her because of that but she okay with it. She gave him a son who sadly passed away as an infant, and then a series of daughters, and again a son who sadly passed away as a child. They were married for 24 years and it sadly ended with her death which is called the Year of Sorrow.

Honestly think now how many men would never consider a wife who is older than them let alone by 15 years. How many men would blame their wives for the death of the child and then divorce then and there. How many men would have been angry at only having daughters. And how many men would defend their past wife from their future one's. The Prophet loved Khadijah for the rest of his life and no matter what would defend her.

The Prophet didn't care about age and only having strong sons, and Khadijah didn't care about money and how rich her husbands family should be.

People enjoy talking about the Prophet but only the parts they agree with and enjoy, many muslim men have this obsession with having strong son's and treat their daughters as inferiors who should try to marry into a wealthy family.

It's actually mostly sorted over the past year, but I also have had a lot of experience doing this kind of thing so it turned out pretty well. 

I realize that this goes against the asian family ethos and I fully expect you to either say no outright to this or otherwise just sort of wince and bury it, but if you're so fragged out, you need to give serious thought to foisting things like your parents' business off on someone else. (BOOM goes all the heads of the asians in the crowd.) At the core, parents want their kids to be successful. If you point out that being their paperwork slave is part of why you're not able to move up at your job, they will say ""then work harder you slacker dog!"" ... if you figure out a solution that still serves their needs but doesn't require work from you, it may mollify them somewhat.

There are also genetic consequences of bearing a child that was sired by a relative.

There are also people who are opposed to ALL abortion.

You sound like you would prefer the second mindset to the first.  There's a difference between being a partner in consensual sex and being raped.

&gt;I've never known someone who was prolife and for handing out condoms to high schoolers

I'm pro-choice and opposed to handing out condoms to high schoolers.  I would not be opposed to vending machines in the bathrooms, but not just handing them out.

That's not about thinking premarital sex is evil...that's about thinking that high schoolers are irresponsible.  I really don't think high schoolers should be having a lot of sex.

In my opinion, just handing out condoms to everyone is akin to saying, ""Go ahead, everyone's doing it.""  Also, condoms don't prevent herpes and herpes is forever.

It was my understanding that being in a place you legally had the right to be only meant that you do not have a duty to retreat. I always thought that deadly force was still justified if your life was threatened and you had no means to safely escape.

It is possible I am wrong about this, but I have not been able to find anything that applies to this type of situation. The way I read the [Michigan Self Defense Act](http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-Act-309-of-2006) seems like it only applies to Duty to Retreat.

polysyllabist,AskMen,1390514338.0,"Yes to all of this, but it's also about comparative dating pools.

a 20yo girl might date anywhere from an 18yo guy to a 26 yo guy. Which is to say, a 26, 27 or even 28 yo guy would date a 20 yo girl no problem.

a 20yo guy is more likely to date from 18 to maybe 22. Not that he is opposed to dating a 26yo woman, for example. But her preferences align with her pool of guys from 25 to 30something.

Because women have a larger pool in the earlier years, they have a comparatively easier time (in addition to phenomena such as having higher market value, not needing to approach but can be passive) than guys of the same age. And because those women in a guy's range will skew towards dating men their age or older, it further reduces the available women within the male pool.

Early 20's is a difficult market to compete in. You're in or just finishing school and competing against guys with established jobs, who've had time to develop hobbies and skills, have had more practice in the market, and have more disposable income to back their inherent looks/charms."

Organized labor pushing for shorter weeks with higher compensation is the only way something like that comes about either through the state or worker ownership(socialism). Exempt status salaried employees have to be part of that fight too though. Otherwise capital will just continue pilling on hours for those people.

92MsNeverGoHungry,Military,1390515224.0,"Firstly, I am truly sorry for your loss.  

Basically it falls to the embalming team at Dover.  The three situations we deal with are fully viewable, where they are dressed in their uniform (as it sounds your husband was); a head wrap, where the head is wrapped in gauze but their body is dressed; and a full body wrap, where the body is fully wrapped and the uniform is laid atop them.

The primary concern for this, and all parts of the process, is the family.  We want to take every step possible to ensure that your loved ones are treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve.  To that end, if there's any chance at all that we can make the face presentable you can be damned sure we will.

The issue is that due to the nature of the wounds, it is sometimes impossible for us to fully close wounds or wrap them in a way that we can dress them, which is why we go to a full body wrap.  Even then, they can be considered viewable, though often times the family will opt not to show their loved one's remains in that manner.

Having seen the remains as they come in to Dover  (still wearing their kit covered in sweat and blood, with medical interventions still in place) and then seen them on the other end dressed in the finest uniform they've ever worn, I have to say that the embalming team at Dover has, without a doubt, some of the most talented artists in that field anywhere in the world."

Wacky features of Ennloged are:

* /ʀ/ and /ɾ/ are not allophones (or whatever it's called)  
* Neuter and nonspecific pronouns are separate cases  
* Non-personal pronouns are fleshed the f*ck out to be more specific (English's 30 vs. Ennloged's 50)  
* Numbers are a pain. 1999 (the year) becomes ""dainamorlunner daimoamidain"" which translates literally to ""four-five-teen-hundred ninety-five-four"".  
* Plan to make it a pitch accent language so that I can have even more homophones.

Renner1,OneY,1390516275.0,"&gt; However, that does not mean the intent is to display.

That's just too bad, because the vast majority of people can't read other people's minds to see what their actual intent is.

I'm going to give a shitty example, but still sort of relevant-- I could walk around with a t-shirt that has Stalin's face on it. 

By no means does that mean that I think Stalin was a good guy, or that I'm actively trying to glorify him or his actions.

But the majority, if not the vast majority, of people who know who Stalin is, will think that my intent is to glorify Stalin, because I'm wearing a shirt with his face on it. 

If you're a girl and you wear a shirt or top that does put your breasts into prominence, especially if you're busty, or if you walk around with your thong visible, people are going to take notice, even if you actively don't want them to.

It's not as though they think, in 99.9% of these situations, that they have grounds to go up and grope the girl, or try to stick their fingers up her ass, but people will take notice of things like that are sexually arousing or suggestive.

&gt; you're venturing dangerously close to ""look what she's wearing, she asked for it"" territory. 

You're turning someone being looked at into some sort of sexual assault atrocity. That's maybe what the most idiotic and irrational of the third wave does, but again-- I'm not even talking about some jackass going up to someone and staring at their breasts for 10 minutes or something like that.

You are characterizing women as not being functioning adults, though-- as though they're completely oblivious and perpetually victimized/manipulated on a daily basis.

&gt; espousing the notion that wearing specific clothes (and by extension, your reaction) overrides or cancels out someone's agency or opinion. ""I don't care what you say, I find your clothes arousing so you're not allowed to get mad when I look"" is the thin edge of a wedge that ends in TheRedPill. 

This doesn't have to be some huge issue at all, and again I think you're taking what I'm saying and turning it into something completely different.

cluberti,sysadmin,1390516485.0,"I cannot imagine how opening more ports would make things any less or more secure, other than there are more ports in use - any attacker would still have to have something listening/watching traffic along the wire to intercept/MITM the RPC traffic, and at that point your problems are bigger than someone has  seen what's going across dynamic RPC ports.  I understand defense-in-depth, but this is the sort of scenario IPSec protects against in the first place.  LDAP over SSL is another way to secure communications and reduce port usage, and is another defense-in-depth measure that actually increases security on the domain.  At the very least, IPSec really *should* be enabled where there are any security concerns, *because* it makes communications across the network more secure and reduces MITM attacks on it's own, amongst other things.  LDAP over SSL should also be considered, as it has an impact on DC communication security as well.  Note that there are ways to configure [IPSec in tunnel mode](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786385.aspx) to allow a firewall/IDS device that supported it to be able to decrypt the traffic, inspect, and forward it on re-encrypted.

I guess the question is, is the desire *actual* security of communications, or the desire to watch what's happening and hope someone catches something if an issue occurs?  If you're not already using IPSec to encapsulate and secure communications between hosts where additional security is required, and have either implemented or are at least considering LDAP over SSL, I'd argue there may be a misunderstanding as to which is the more secure way to configure and secure communications between domain hosts, including DCs.  Old methods of security (watching unencrypted traffic between hosts) is really not security at all, it's just watching for a breach of it.  It lacks protections that actual security, coupled with monitoring, will provide."

sockmonkeysaurus,TwoXChromosomes,1390516802.0,"I'll go through each point. I'm straight.

&gt;When I watch movies I always fall for the female character. I will then proceed to fantasize about pleasuring her.

I fall for personalities in characters regardless of them being male or female. It's mostly characters that I admire or can relate to. I really don't fantasize much about female characters. But I can appreciate an attractive woman in a borderline sexual sense.

&gt;I never fantasize about the male character. Do straight women fantasize about the male character?

Everyone fantasizes about so many different things. 

&gt;However I'm aroused by men's genitalia and the idea of being fucked hard. But the idea of soft loving sex with a man is not particularly appealing to me. It is just sex. Ever since I hit puberty I would fantasize about two people having sex but with much focus on pleasuring the girl. I proceeded to pretend I was the guy in my fantasies.

Nothing wrong with any of those. Like I said, everyone fantasizes about different things. Fantasies don't necessarily indicate specific sexuality. 

&gt;I am not sexually aroused by the anatomy of a girls body but I think their beautiful. However if I love her, then I can be aroused.

Like I mentioned above, I can appreciate a woman's body in a way almost bordering on sexual. But I would still consider myself straight.

&gt;Do you ever fantasize about pleasuring a guy because you really want to, because its arousing? Do you like the sounds they make? (I don't)

Who doesn't fantasize about sex? I like sex with guys. When it comes to sounds, I like masculine sounds, but softer. Like little growls and grunts, but not like UUUUNNNNGGGHHHHH. I don't like higher pitched sounds from a guy, like almost feminine sounding moans. That's a turn-off for me. But the right little growl? I love it.

&gt;I do however like the attention of boys, but I think that is all, I soon get bored.

By attention, do you mean in a sexual or flirtatious way? I'm assuming that's what you meant. Getting hit on is flattering, but if you get bored, then you might not have met a guy that's caught your eye in the right way (assuming you are straight).

&gt;Do abs and a mans butt turn you on? Is it attractive to the point where you want to touch them?

I like abs on a guy. I also like a cute butt on a guy. I'm not a handsy person when it comes to butts; I don't see a cute butt and think ""damn, I want me a handful of that!"". But aesthetically, I can appreciate it. A nice set of abs I'm more inclined to think touchy-feely things about. I'm an abs person. Overall though, I like a toned, fit body on a guy.

Fantasies and porn preferences are not indicative of sexuality. There are plenty of straight people who have homosexual fantasies, and likewise I'm sure there are plenty of gay folks who have had hetero fantasies. And like you mentioned, there is a spectrum of sexuality. From the details of your post, it sounds like you might have bisexual urges, but you haven't figured out exactly where on the spectrum you are. There's nothing wrong with that. The best way to figure out and cement your sexuality would be to look at reality instead of fantasies. If a scenario came along where there was a woman you loved (you mentioned you only feel arousal when you care about her) that wanted to engage in sex with you, how do you think you would realistically react? Similarly, how would you react to a situation involving a guy? You didn't mention your age in the post, nor did you mention if you have ever had any kind of sexual experience to draw on with a man or a woman, so I can only speak in hypotheticals. I'm going to assume you're on the younger side. With age comes experience, and with experience comes knowing exactly what it is you want and need in relationships and in sex."

Possibly through tax penalties on number of hours worked per employee, as that is the yardstick being used by this article. This would also force a higher number of employees per company, which may help the unemployment rate. Then again, it may push more workers overseas; which we could counter with raising of tariff rates on countries with lower osha standards. This would also cause a tariff increase by our European counterparts on our goods, as their standards are higher than ours; which would end up causing a rising tide of employee benefits around the world. Doubtful though that this would be the end result as it would cause a drop in profit margins and shareholder value; those of the Rentier Class probably wouldn't stand for it.

We met at a grocery store where he pulled up in his car, i hopped into the passenger seat and we pulled away to do a lap of the lot.

In there he pulled a ziplock bag out of a novelty movie cup (those plastic ones you pay an extra $2 for with a popular movie design on it) I gave him the cash, weed in backpack and he dropped me off on the other side of the parking lot.

I got in touch by a classmate in college who I know smoked and I just asked for his dealers number, he texted his guy to make sure it was cool and then sent me the number later that day.

This guy while is a dope dealer is professional regarding the timing of reply's to orders and being more or less on time. I will ask for a half O at noon and we will meet at 4:30 after he gets off work. I know that this is abnormal for dealers so I consider myself lucky.

Israel ""doesn't recognize"" the ICC (ICJ?) because the international courts don't burst into tears and drop the matter immediately if they're whiningly accused of ""demonizing Israel"" or the still-popular ""anti Semitism"".

So the question is largely an academic one, as Israel wouldn't recognize (and would screech ""anti Semitism"" as much as possible), if ever the ICJ dealt with the issue of the Qibla massacre, and determined officially the guilt of the dead reptile Sharon and his unit, who carried out the massacre.

&gt; It was entirely on what was legal and illegal. 

By whose standards? The ICJ can't charge Israel for engaging in actions that are obviously illegal by international standards, due to the issue of Israel not recognizing the ICJ so they can pretend that they don't commit war crimes when they obviously do."

LyssaBrisby,relationships,1390518128.0,"Definitely, legal marriage should be the least you should accept before having sex with him. Marriage is part legality and part social and community recognition, however; it would be easier for him to separate or divorce or attempt an annulment without the social pressure of having had the full ceremony, so weigh that, too.

Basically, given everything you've said? I would treat the idea of this man suggesting sex before marriage as a **test.** *If you say yes, you fail, in his eyes* - whether he admits it or not. If you are the virginal/virtuous/traditional bride he claims to really want, you would not dream of putting the cart before the horse, and you would be offended he would suggest such a thing. And in fact you would expect him to take the lead on accelerating the marriage if he really wanted you: if he loved you and respected you, he in fact would accept nothing less.

Ideally, he would convince your parents to let the full marriage occur whether or not your sister has settled down (especially since she's not even engaged and there's no timeline -- ridiculous). But legal marriage is the bare minimum."

Look, I don't expect everyone to take up an armed struggle for social revolution rather than joining the military, or go off into the wilderness to turn their backs on society until society gets better – obviously it won't, and as an individual you can only change it from the inside. What I do believe, however, is that by joining the military you do have to make peace with what they do to a certain extent, and if you have joined the American military that's something I could not make peace with.

Women in the military face some unique problems (in both the scale and the nature), and I was encouraged by Magpie32's comment * but ultimately if you join the military, the US military in particular, I would consider that to be joining the richest and and most powerful machine of imperialism in the world, and I certainly believe it's a position of incredible privilige to have a job going around invading other sovereign countries. And I am sure that everyone can agree that one of them which was about 10 years ago now was justified with lies, so I am going to treat you as if you somewhat willingly joined an imperialist war machine.

Good luck to you.  If there's one thing I've learned after a year of failure, it's that it's better to get something done decently than waiting until last minute or not doing it at all.  One thing that would prevent me from doing my work would be the mindset ""I'm too foggy / demotivated right now, and I want to do a really good job on this - I'll do it later"".  Eventually I would do it an hour before it was due and it would come out *terrible*, and I would have much rather settled for getting it done in a reasonable time frame despite it not being my best work.

I've got to say that I almost really like what they have to offer.  Before my 920, I had an Android so I'm familiar with other OS' and where MS falls flat.  Here's a quick good / bad fromm a user's perspective:  

**GOOD**:  

 - The hardware is really quite nice.  It feels good in the hand and the buttons seem to be where they need to be.  
 - Wireless charging is a little thing, but very nice to have.  
 - Email client is fantastic.  I use the phone for work mostly, and pounding out emails is terrific.  
 - Live tiles are very good.  My home screen is packed with stuff, and it's still very much usable.  
 - Nokia apps are top shelf (GPS, Maps, Camera)  

**Less Good**  

 - The phone is heavy.  Long calls feel long.  
 - The full app list isn't group-able, so it gets difficult to manage as it grows.  

**Bad** (Most of this stuff comes back to Microsoft)  

 - Development cycle is painfully long.  I know what MS is doing (look!  constant improvements), but they're behind and need to unfuckup some stuff to get to even ground.  
 - 1 volume control for everything, turning the music down to a reasonable volume leaves the ringer nearly unhearable.  
 - App store too small.  I don't miss Starbucks, I miss my local bank, I miss public transport, I miss Llama.  

**REAL Bad**  

 - Default search engine:  Bing.  

The thing is they're *SO* close.  A few more fixes and they'll be on par.  A few more after that and they could be ahead, but it appears that the horrible internal MS proces"

&gt; According to Wood, capitalists are those who ""appropriate workers' surplus labour without direct coercion.""

That's putting the cart before the horse just a little, but that might just be me. She's putting the onus on the capitalists instead of emphasizing the voluntary nature of capitalist employment, where alienative work doesn't arise out of acquisitiveness itself but instead from economic disparities which existed before capitalism and are enforced *not* by strict capitalist interactions but by dominance relationships and the manipulation of government.

&gt; is (as Wood calls it) extra-economic

To me, this is annoying because it presupposes capitalism, to an extent. Economic pressure as such as exists in capitalism, is relatively novel. I tend to stick by the old anthropological standard - coercion in capitalism is 'systematic,' because it's not enforced by anybody in particular but is a function of the system nonetheless, and feudal coercion is 'direct.'

&gt;  Contrast them with, for example, clergy, whose wealth was generated primarily through tithes and the extraction of revenue from land - not (at least not primarily) through the appropriation of surplus value produced by wage laborers.

The point was that it's not a shitty assumption to assume that a woman who's dressed in a way that's effectively showing off her breasts or her legs or whatever knows what's on display and is intentionally trying to show off some decent attribute.

Once again, I'm not talking about grabbing her by the snatch, I'm not talking about staring at her tits and drooling, I'm talking about people taking notice in general, often in a discreet way.

You can't complain about ""society objectifying me"" when you make a conscious decision to dress in a way that, whether you intend to or not, does show off your body. You can complain if someone does something completely uncalled for because of it, however.

&gt;   If someone gets mad at you for looking, just fucking apologize. Don't get indignant as though they're in the wrong, because 'look what she's wearing'.

If I'm ever stupid enough or intoxicated enough to tell some girl ""I want to fuck your ass through those leggings"", or if I stare at some cleavage with perverse intensity for a lengthy period of time, then that's obviously grounds for the girl to get upset or angry, and it is behaviour that's rude and that should be apologized for.

If some girl gets all angry and third wavey because I looked at her ass momentarily, then that's preposterous. If they're going to make a scene and pretend that I sexually assaulted them, then, yes, apologize so it doesn't turn into something it isn't.

&gt; I'm trying to attack the attitude of ""She's dressed like that, so she can't get mad when people look"". It's just a shitty attitude. 

It isn't a shitty attitude, as far as just looking at something goes. It's not objectifying and it's not rude or socially awkward to the extreme.

&gt; That your notions of acceptable dress are arbitrarily defined by cultural values, and cultural values change. You're defining what is acceptable based upon your own beliefs, and when people have different values about what is considered ""too revealing"", you deride and degrade. 

Right, and there are some morons who think it's acceptable to walk around with their bits flopping about and anyone who doesn't like it is ""prudish"" or ""Victorian"".

Completely delusional.

There's a time and a place for different sorts of clothing, but I find there are some women who do take what they wear to an extreme that isn't acceptable for polite society, or anywhere public, really.

If you want to dress like a stripper, then go work at a strip club-- and then complain about being delusional and thinking being a stripper is ""empowering"" or some other rubbish.

&gt; It's just a self-centric attitude. That because they choose to wear something that you have personally classified as 'for no other reason than to reveal'

Seriously, though-- can you think of *any* reason why someone would wear a top that showed off a whole lot of cleavage, if not because they wanted to show off?

They want to ""feel good about themselves"" because they know their bodies are desirable, sure. That's the same ""explanation"" some women who're really agitational about this issue give as to why they wear these preposterously high heels that have no actual benefit apart from aesthetic value. 

That one's really funny, actually. I think wedges are often the best look for them, and they're ultimately a lot less damaging for their legs.

&gt; they aren't allowed to be comfortable in their skin.

No one's saying that. I'm certainly not advocating going up behind someone and rubbing your penis into their ass because they're wearing spandex pants or something like that.

It would be fun to do, under the proper circumstances, granted.

&gt; And also that similar ridiculous arguments are made to justify the existence of burqas ""women are hot, and they should be made to cover the parts I find hot otherwise their idiots for bieng mad"".

Who actually justifies burqas? The Taliban, and maybe some Al Qaeda type or takfiri somewhere.

They're idiots-- as an Arabist, I can say they're certainly not the ""norm"" or an accepted way of thinking. Don't talk about things if you only have some vague idea about what you're trying to talk about or because you saw a burqa once and it's ""that must be the norm"".

&gt; Rather than take responsibility, you'd just rather say 'it's her fault for wearing those clothes'. 

that's just a preposterous supposition."

I've met a Pakistani in december - I've learned about traditional wedding gifts in Pakistan and how they're different from German ones, I've learned a fair about some unusual(from a german POV obviously) laws in his country, I've learned a few new words etc. - that wouldn't have occured at all if I would have ignored him neither looking German nor speaking German that good at all.

Avistew,polyamory,1390519952.0,"You can absolutely have more than one primary (what I like to say is, there is more than one primary colour. Primary doesn't mean unique), and you can also have a primary you've been with less time than (one of) your secondary(ies), to name a couple examples.

Primary and secondary describe a relationship dynamic. It's about commitment and expectations. Some relationships are more intertwined, and usually involve living together, being married, having children or sharing finances. Some are more independent and don't involve any of the above. What matters is what works for the people in each relationship.

Already having a committed, marriage-like relationship does not mean you can't have another one. But remember that symmetry is not the same as fairness. Saying that the person you just met and the person you've been with for years are exactly the same, and trying to treat them exactly the same, is flawed.

A closer comparison, if you have to compare at all, would not be ""ok, I did this with my husband, I should do the same with my new boyfriend"", but more along the lines of ""okay, I've been with my boyfriend for X time. When I had been with my husband for that same amount of time, what was our relationship like?"" and base it more on that.

But that is of course flawed, too, because people are different and relationships don't follow a bullet point list of things to do in order to move to the next step. On top of that, you are one of the people in your relationships and have presumably changed, meaning that what you did back then, you might not be doing now if you had just met your husband.

So really, the way to look at it is not treating a new partner as a primary right away, because, well, it's like marrying someone you've just met or just started dating. Works for some people but most would consider it rushing a LOT, and going that fast can be a recipe for disaster.

What's important to keep in mind is the possible evolution of the relationship. Can that relationship become primary? Will you, and your existing partner, allow it to evolve that way? Would it work for you? Would it work for your new partner?

If you've been for someone 5 years and someone 2 months, it seems unrealistic to have the same level of intimacy with both, be it only because you know one of them so much better than the other. But once it's been years for both people, I think there is a point where you reach ""established relationship"" and it does not change that much afterwards.

It's a bit like people's ages. There is a big difference between a 15 year old and a 20 year old, but 25 and 30? At that point they're both adult. They presumably both have adult experiences such as having a job, paying the bills and so on. The extra 5 years of experience the older person gets is something, but it's not as huge a difference as it would have been between ages 5 and 10, or 10 and 15, or 15 and 20.

People have relationships that involve multiple primaries, and it can work. As always, it's about communication, compatibility, sharing your expectations rather than assuming, and so on.

I wish you the best of luck. I think the problems can arise at the very beginning, when a new partner is introduced, or a bit later on, when the relationship changes (as relationships do) and moves from a secondary relationship to a primary relationship (in my opinion all relationships start as secondary), and everyone involves adapts to the changes and realises the problems they haven't voiced or didn't realise might turn out to be issues.

Once people have settled back into ""routine"" with the recently secondary, now another primary, it seems to go pretty smoothly at that point, from what I've seen.

Good luck in your search for multiple primaries, but remember not to try to force the relationships to become something they're not or something they're not ready for."
evade16,saplings,1390519959.0,"Honestly what people below are saying is true with the ""omg concentrates so concentrated  too much for beginner"" but in moderation you would be fine. Just understand that it is potent and so either A load less into your vape or B take smaller hits with bigger breaks in between to judge your reaction. Scratch that to both A and B until you know your tolerance and the potency and you find a good balance. 

If you are dabbing use a tooth pick rather then a dabber for smaller amounts with more control. When you think that you have a right amount of oil for your first hit, cut it in half a pea sized amount is an insane dab so try maybe 1/4 the size of a pea or smaller for your first go and take it from there. 

For your first time do some prep. Have some drinks, snacks, be comfy, do it at a time when you wont be disturbed for a long time. Have music or a movie to watch. Don't get panicked if you start to cough like you are about to die, have a drink and the feeling of sandpaper on your throat will pass as you drink and have something to eat.

Personally my favorite drinks are after I have settled down and am taking a break from smoking/vaping I have a beer (read single chilled beer) which I find cools ones throat well plus beer releases dopamine to your brain compounded with weed causes a nice relaxed feeling. After that I stick to something fizzy, I like straight carbonated water because I'm trying to cut pop out of my diet and mango juice. There are claims that mango juice helps the high evolve and improve, im not sure but it is damn tasty.

I know wall of text blah blah blah but I hope it helps. From one 20 year old to another I hope you enjoy your first time."

Qieth,loseit,1390520649.0,"8 months ago, I wouldn't dream of going to the gym. I hated take g the stairs (well, still do) :P I started losing weight by calorie counting, and I was happy that I could just do that. 

But after a month of losing weight and doing great, I became greedy. I wanted more. I was changing my body, and I wanted to help it in any way I could. So I went swimming. 

God it was awful. I swam a lot as a kid, but I couldn't even do two lanes (25 meters per lane) without a break in between them. After an hour, I had managed 20.

But I stuck to it, and it didn't take long before I saw improvements. Within a few weeks, I was doing 40 lanes per hour. Nowadays, a ""quick easy swim"" is 80 lanes in an hour. 

I got tired of swimming though. There are a lot of kids, and not a whole lot of swimming lanes. And they are right next to the bloody kids and all their toys. Also, I have long had a dream of starting to run, so since new years, I've been going to the gym instead of the pool for running and lifting (mild lifting). 

First run was tough, but I managed about 5 km in 40 minutes by alternating between fast walk and slow run. I saw quite a rapid increase in what I could do. I am now able to run ""indefinitely"" at a slow run (faster than the first) but now I get bored with that so I alternate between slow run and slightly faster run. And I don't feel like I need to go down to fast walk speed. 

It's only been a couple of weeks with running, but I can see a big change already. Sometimes while I'm walking down the street, I feel the urge to just sprint the rest of the way home.

I would never have imagined feeling like this last year. "

To hide the smell:

- Smoke Outside

- Change cloths when you come inside

- Take a shower (hot water causes dopamine to flow and so you get the smell of your hands face and hair while feeling even better)

- Dont forget to stash your stash

To look less high:

- Eye drops either Rhotos if you are in the states (and brave) or any other anti red-eye eye drops

- If people ask you why you are acting odd claim sleep deprivation

- Unless its abnormal for your personality, seclude yourself from those you are hiding it from ie. chill in your room

Some of the effects:

- Dry mouth - have a drink handy

- Munchies - have a snack handy (oranges can provide relief from both)

- Amusement at the little things in life

- A new appreciation for things taken for granted (softness of bed, beats or lyrics in a song, texture of food or drink, peoples company ect)

- Sometimes uncontrollable laughter that can become contagious between stoned people (laughing at them because they are laughing and vise versa)

- Pretty much most other stereotypes are fairly correct

Varryl,whatcarshouldIbuy,1390520905.0,"I haven't really liked Nissan Sentras since they started collaborating with Renault. They're sort of average or sub-average across the board. I rented one (think it was an '08) and it was comfortable enough, but nothing stood out. I did own an 04 and it was pretty unreliable, but that's just anecdotal. 

A regular Subaru should be pretty comparable on insurance as any other budget compact car. Depending on your location and coverage, I doubt it'd be any more different than say 100 bucks per 6 months (ballpark guess.) 

Subarus are AWD which means it has more diffs, and will wear on tires differently than FWD and RWD cars. So you'll find that there will be slightly more maintenance since there are more moving parts, but otherwise, they're quite regular cars. Unless you wind up getting a WRX. 

Source: I own a Subaru and have owned other Subarus. 

What about a Mazda Protege5? Some of them come with moonroofs and the needful, and I like how they look. Probably would not have AUX jack as they are too old. 

Also, Pontiac Vibes are technically Toyota Matrixes (Matrices?) with Pontiac badges on them, before you dismiss them as just being GM, they usually go for cheaper for the same equipment as the Toyotas. 

Spitballing here, you could probably find a used Acura TL or TSX that might fit the bill. Same goes for a Honda Accord. It might be a little older than the Sentra though, and won't have AWD."

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1390521008.0,"Excuse me for this novel, but... I love races.

&gt; I want to create non-human races for my world, but I keep falling into the trap of ""Human with purple skin and a few minor differences"" or ""Basically an elf"", I can't think of an imaginative race that isn't derived from cliches or isn't just a human with a bigger forehead and a tail.

Awww man, one of my favorite races is my nagas. In the beginning, they were oppressive elves. Then they were oppressive *ice elves,* so hell, snow white hair and purple skin. Basically elves with a twist but purple. But then I was playing Dota, and so *then* I decided I really wanted some nagas in my world (because fuckyeah Naga Siren). So then they turned into nagas...

But since they're snakes, I made them kind of translucent. Then I glued them to a continent I had scribbled on a piece of paper and saw what happened. Let's be clear - no plate tectonics, the very basics of weather, just some blobs and mountains. I was reading the Secret History of the Mongols, so it was mostly a steppe with some basins and stuff, because I thought that would be cool.

So they ran into a couple of major problems. Predation by a giant bird race who lived to their south. They're snakes in a cold climate, so they like to live in 'burrows' - their cities are tightly stacked and they invented steam heat fairly early. These cities are universally on large rivers and near the coast - they can't ride horses without legs so it was the only way they could trade goods. This maritime skill would become very important to them later on. Magic became very important for them, because it was the most reliable way to fight the bird-people. Eventually the birds and them established more diplomatic relationships, and with no one to fight but themselves - and their population centered around these massive fortresses - they had a very peaceful history, with all the violence and tumult going on behind the scenes. They rapidly became masters of technology and magic, and set out to conquer the world, with vast fleets that could cross even the most broad oceans.

They didn't succeed - some very ancient powers opposed them. Their best and brightest went off to become demigods. Much of their culture was spread across the ocean, however, which lead to almost universal respect for their philosophers, and some diffusion of technology, rapidly advancing the world.

Their clothes mostly consist of long coats and girdles. They find it proper to cover their cloacas in public, but don't wear pants, so these are rather like gaudy, oversized belts. If their jackets were too long, they couldn't slither much.

They aren't scaled all over - in fact, their tail-scales are more like massive, even callouses. They don't moult in the same way, either, not one large patch but periodic shedding. There is an industry of spa treatments (popular in post-invasion lands as a luxury) which is not only very commonly used, but held to special standards and regulation.

And on. I mean, I have *a dozen* pages of this shit. Lendvan philosophers. Vast resorts on their continents. They invent gunpowder, and a school of magic, and have a complicated oligarchic/clan-based government system... there's a lot going on.

But you see... I started with elves, but purple. And I mean, they're nagas, it's been done, but I love them - there's *so much detail* to be found. I'm not making this shit up because I like it (I do like it) but instead it arises naturally from what I said.

They are snake people. They live in the steppe, in the north-meridional region of my world. And there's *so much* I could tell you about them. They don't read like elves, I can tell you that - they aren't mysterious, they aren't all mages, they aren't in tune with nature. They have guns, clan rivalries that would put Rome to shame, are masters of the sea, and have revolutionized the technology and politics of my world.

But all you have to do is start with *something.* And keep changing it, keep adding things you think are cool, And at some point, it'll just take off, and it'll build itself."

* If I saw you walking across from me on the sidewalk, and we met eye-to-eye, and if I said hi to you, which nickname would you prefer - Turkleton, Brown Bear, or Ghandi?

* Does Zach go into his own little world in real life like JD does on Scrubs?

* Work in the entertainment business can be really busy (also, fatherhood), right? Do you get the time to see and hang out with friends you met on previous shows and/or projects?

* And now a question relating to your main focus right now, your fundraising campaign! There are *lots* of good causes to support needy people. So what convinced you to choose Soles4Souls?

Thank you for your time! I look forward to your Tweets with Zach, and I hope you have a great year!"

lsirius,relationships,1390521688.0,"It was extremely hurtful and counseling helped a lot, but still sometimes he will be sad and say ""I miss my mom,"" which breaks my heart.  If I had the authority or ability to keep the kids &amp; my husband away from all of them I would because I hate seeing people I love get hurt again and again. I feel so bad for the guilt tripping and angry texts he will have to endure next weekend while the birthday party is happening.  They always say stuff like ""You are breaking your mother's heart,"" or ""You don't care about the children,"" which couldn't be further from the truth.  

I think a lot of the hurt comes from what was your initial reaction: What the hell?  What are we missing?  What did we do wrong?  Why are they being like this to us?  Can't they see that the kids are better off here?  And we truly can't understand it.  My husband has always been last place in his family, but it's the only family he knew and loved for a very long time.  

It's hard to replace the nurture and care and love he received from the beginning of his life with what is fair and right and normal.  He let them get away with a lot initially because he thought it was normal, and unfortunately, when he started to stand up for his kids and what was right, he became the bad guy.

I'm hurt too because I married a man with children I love and an ex who has done everything she can to get them to hate me, but at first at least, we had his family's support.  Now we don't.  It often feels like it's us against the (people who live all in the burbs) world. 

My husband can't even share a success at work with his family because he fears that they will tell his ex and she will try to get child support raised.  

Ugh.  It's really depressing typing it out like this.  My husband has a talking block up when it comes to discussing it because it hurts him so much, and I'll tell you this much, I'd do ANYTHING to make him feel better.  I even offered to leave once so that he wouldn't have to hear me telling him how things worked in my family (I have 4 brothers and sisters and 3 of them are divorced with kids and my dad was married with kids prior to my mom) and how we worked it out, and how it wasn't right how they were treating him.  

He's saying now he won't switch, he won't take them, and he'll just stay out of their bullshit drama, but it won't work that way, and even if he ignores everything they say reaction wise, it's still going to hurt him.   "

evade16,saplings,1390522057.0,"Depends on where and what level of job. If being stoned could effect your professionalism: heavy machine operator, public transit operator, medical professional ect then expect to be tested.

A retail job most likely wont test especially if it is a national chain. restaurants also are unlikely to test because the majority of chefs (that I have heard of and worked with) probably smoke weed and it is difficult to replace a head chef or assistants. Even wait staff so long as you aren't stoned at work you should be fine.

Personally I am a National Account Manager for a North American publishing company. I blaze frequently going as far as flying with my oil pen on occasion. I know of other top level sales reps for multimillion dollar companies who were drinking AVB chocolate milk at trade shows.

If you aren't sure if they test ask an employee before your interview. If its a shop just ask ""hey im thinking about working here, what are some things I should look out for in the interview and the daily operations? how is the manager? owner? coworkers?"" usually people love an opportunity to gripe about work or brag about it so it shouldn't be that much of an issue. If you are worried come in with a drink from starbucks or something like that and offer it to break the ice saying ""hey I have an interview tomorrow figured Id introduce myself and get to know a little about the job here want a drink?""

And if push comes to shove if you are in a job and they do test you for drugs and you know you are going to fail it isn't that much of an issue at least here in Canada. If you est positive for drugs and face disciplinary actions claim dependance or addiction. To fire you would be against discrimination laws and instead they must put you on temporary leave until you can deal with ""your addiction"" test clean and can come back to work. If they do fire you then take them to court or in the meeting to fire you remind them of that fact and you should be fine.

wow wall of text

But I decided that there wasn't a big difference between me in clothes and in swimming gear. People see that I am fat regardless. And once you're in the water, the refraction helps a bit. 

We both know that the biggest issue is how we *think* other people perceive us. We think that people just see a fat dude in swim shorts *because that is what we see*. Even when looking at other large people working out.

But in reality, what we are looking at is a large person doing something about it! That goes for me, you and anybody else who is actively working out. And when you hold your head high and dive I  and give it your best, people see someone motivated to change. 

After realising this with myself, I started noticing some of the other swimmers I would see once in a while. They weren't all Michael Phelps. It wasn't fitness buffs. It was last get and slim people alike, people focused on working out and getting in shape. You are one of those.

Gemini00,Xcom,1390522266.0,"The transition from Normal difficulty XCOM to Classic/Impossible reminds me in many ways of making the transition from playing the single player Starcraft campaign and then trying to go online and compete again real players.

In both cases, most of the ""lessons"" you learned about how to win before have to be thrown out the window, and you have to develop entirely new mental models and learn to think about the game in a fundamentally different way. Previously there was enough leeway that you could afford to experiment, to play ""creatively"" in a way that seemed the most fun to you even if it wasn't as efficient. Now suddenly time, money, and soldiers are critically limited resources that have to be allocated in the most optimal way possible or you will quickly lose.

This shift in mentality towards ruthless efficiency, careful advance planning, and optimizing is a difficult gap to bridge for many gamers, especially so for those who feel that being forced into a single efficient strategy kills the fun of the game for them. Personally I enjoy it, but I can absolutely see how it's not for everyone."

I seem to have run out of steam after a very few short years in my career.  My company move was also a massive shift in career direction in the hopes that I could get back some spark or enjoyment.  I've discovered that the parts of my career that I found oppressive in my last job are universal to engineering and are actually a bit worse in this new position.

I was good at being a student.  I went into an engineering degree program, but I probably would have been just as successful going for psychology, photography, or just about anything else.  My enjoyment of school, it turns out, had very little to do with the subject matter.

The training and adventurous parts of my engineering career, on which I thrive, are only really prevalent in the lowest tiers of my field's corporate hierarchy.  Advancing in my career means moving away from the things I find rewarding and enjoyable and towards the drudgery that I have trouble doing.

I just don't think it's fair to say that Woody does SO MUCH work, and Wings just shows up and talks. Wings puts at least 80% percent of the effort into the show as Woody does, so just calling him a guest isn't fair, especially since he shows up every week. 

Also, if you're going to call wings a guest, then Kyle and Lefty are also just guests, because they don't do the stuff you named. Just because one person manages most of the show doesn't make everyone else on the show beneath him."

K2TheM,forza,1390522503.0,"Making monsters is one of my favorite aspects of Forza. Taking a car, gutting it, swapping it, and putting it in places it doesn't belong. The challenge is in getting it to actually work. It's really easy to just swap it and call it a day, but actually tuning the chassis to handle the increase in output is where the fun really is.

So far my favorite ""Monster"" car in FM5 ( I know, not the same) is a VTEC Swapped OG Mini. With some basic chassis upgrades this puts it nicely in C Class. It still has the Mini problems: fun to slide, horrific to try and recover, also doesn't play well with others; but with the 2.0 swapped in it, it has the power to pull itself around decently. 

In FM4 my pet monster is a S Class Country Squire. Engine swapped and putting out 925hp + 4WD makes it a white line nightmare. Due to the heavy nerfing of 4WD in FM4, it's not overly competitive, but there is no way to get it to S700 and retain RWD.

With any swap/monster creation, it's important to take note of other areas of the car. Generally this means making sure you have at least race level suspension upgrades (Brakes, Shocks/Springs, Swaybars, Rollbar) and a sport transmission + race diff. This will allow you to dial in the basics. From there you can experiment with different tire sizes/types and additional engine upgrades to get the car running competitively. 

Not every Monster will be a winner, but they can be fun to drive."

watermelonpaws,TumblrInAction,1390522928.0,"First of all, I'm gonna say that social justice isn't bad. People who aren't white are still disadvantaged in the Western world (look at some statistics on prison rate, police brutality). [If you don't believe me, I urge you to look at this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge7i60GuNRg). People who are gay still haven't received equality in treatment, especially with regards to being able to be out and keep a job.

My first advice to you would be to listen to some of these people. That doesn't mean you have to automatically accept their argument, or stand by what they say. It just means you have to evaluate it and see for yourself if it's valid. This is what ""check your privilege"" actually meant before social justice warriors hijacked it. It doesn't mean your opinion is invalid, but it means that your experiences are different from oppressed groups, so your opinion may be missing context.

Microaggressions are also a real thing. They're not really meant to be insults, but they're more like Freudian slips. They're not always easy to track, and some people may truly not have meant what was implied, but that's the tough thing about implicit prejudice. It's not always easy to see, but it's there in our attitudes.

As for transgender, it's pretty well established in the field of psychology. It's in the DSM, and it's called gender dysphoria. And there are many people who benefit from gender transition procedures. The reason people use ""male/female identified"" is because trans people aren't often seen as what their gender identity really is. Heck, it's hard for some people to even see them as human instead of this odd species of ""tranny"".

Now, as for the transnational, they probably were just talking about people who are born from other countries but identify within the country they're raised in. For example, if a black woman was born in Africa, and she had been adopted by an American family at the age of 2, she might consider herself American. And she wouldn't be wrong. She is American in all intents and purposes, even if she was born in Africa. She wouldn't be blind to the fact that she's black, but she would just present herself as American.

As for fighting the ""possible SJW fuckery"", I don't know if that's really a concrete goal. If a social justice warrior is clearly being an asswipe at your university, the best thing to do is to call out their behavior. If you stand up for something, people tend to follow you because they feel safer voicing their opinions.

Now, I'm not advising going in guns-blazing. A lot of arguments are started due to misinformation, and if people listen, they often find that other's opinions aren't really all that rabid and crazy as they look to be at first."

The women at the clinic were very sweet and I was  looked after. I changed into the gown and had to put two pads in my undies and I lied down in the surgery and they put a needle in me and asked me a few things and I woke up again, with them walking me to the recovery room with serval other women. 

They checked if I bled a lot, and after a while they called my parents to pick me up. I was able to go on a train and I went to sleep when I got home.

No pain, but don't have sex for a while. I had it too soon, and I felt like I had bad gas. Maybe it is just me, but I became super horny after the abortion, apparently it was the hormones. Like, over the top horny and I felt like I was going Crazy.

Aprikoat,summonerschool,1390523334.0,"Start your jungle route with a plan of where you'll go.

Wanna level 3 gank top? Start your bottom buff

Wanna level 3 gank bot or be in the area because you suspect a gank? Start the top buff

Enemy shaco or anticipating an invade?
Start red buff and ward your blue because 99% of shacos start their blue then blink to your red; usually an easy first blood too because for some reason they never expect you to be smart enough to murder them when they try that

In champion select and during the loading screen you should know what lanes you want to gank and in what order or at the very least have a basic game plan laid out.
Do you have a Shen against someone like Vladimir?

Holy crap you want to camp that lane so shen can get some pressure and so vlad doesn't get scary so fast; normally vlad has a huge advantage over shen.

Is their mid someone like lebonk? Alright, you're gonna have a hard time ganking them so don't waste time unless you know you can force a flash or get a kill. 

On the flipside, do they have a veigar, ahri, kass, or other champ with a weak pre-6? Camp the everloving shit out of them so that they never get a chance to become dangerous. 

If you see a ward being dropped, time it and ping it so you know not to cross it.

Also if you can't do anything about a gank on the other side of the map don't stand there with your dick out and trip over yourself trying to get there; accomplish something useful by ganking a different lane or stealing a dragon or buff or take turrets as collateral. You cannot allow the other team to get that gank off without suffering for it, and if you see you can't gank a lane successfully don't even try. A lot of low elo junglers I see will just stand around for 20 seconds (not farming or doing anything) and then either reveal themselves for no reason and leave or just go in and either die or waste their summoners.

ALSO ALSO: Buff donations. Know the timers and put them in chat and play around them. Knowing their timers with them not knowing yours is an enormous advantage because it gives you map control and jungle pressure. You can also make plays if you catch the jungler or their laner in a rotation to a buff."

There are entire subreddits dedicated to posting pictures of classically attractive female celebrities. There are cult followings for certain celebrities or popular scientists. People get very excited about big AMAs. Then there's the way that so many redditors fixate on the celebrities they claim to hate (Bieber, Miley Cyrus, the Kardashians, Honey Boo Boo, etc.). 

It's kind of interesting how they don't see this hypocrisy and then go on to insult other people who pay attention to celebrities in one way or another."

Or make yourself invaluable to the company. Do your job so well they cant afford to fire you for something as stupid as weed.

Also, depending on your countries anti discrimination laws (I'm in Canada for reference) I can't not be fired for drug use of any kind if I claim dependency. Addition is treated as a handicap in the eyes of the law and If I were to test positive on a drug test (I would right now) and my employer were to try and fire me (they won't) the only thing they can do is give me unpaid leave until I deal with my addiction and test clean again because I could (I wouldn't) sue them for wrongful dismissal based on my addiction and dependency for drugs.

Now if I am at work and have an accident or cause a serious problem (financial loss, injury to customers/coworkers) then they could let me go for negligence or some similar reason. But it would have to be unrelated to drug use.

It is a stupid law to a degree. If I were to hire a sales rep to meet with clients and represent my business but they were a secret crack addict that they hid well until their probationary period was over and their work, personal care and appearance plummeted disturbing my companies reputation I couldn't fire them because of that I would have to find another reason to let them go."

&gt;[2](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004827). [S] Jade: Enter: Such chills, such epicness, it wasn't easy for number 1 to beat this.

&gt;[3](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003840). [S] Descend: I find it funny this made it this high. I think this was the moment the Homestuck really grabbed me. Until now, I expected them to gradually complete the game and come together at a final fight against the black king, following a set storyline of something like say Avatar: The Last Airbender. This showed to me that the story in itself was not going to follow it's own rules and anything could happen.

&gt;[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007138)/[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007152). [[S] Dirk: Synchronize\Unite (Counts as one): I love the way Hussie is able to make these connections and let everything flow together, it's a really amazing thing](/spoiler)

&gt;[5](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003049). [S] Enter: OK I'll admit when I first read the story I wasn't really involved in it (I skipped the Midnight Crew Intermission :$). This finally got me to say, huh this looks like it could be pretty interesting.

&gt;[6](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006290). [[S] END OF ACT 6 INTERMISSION 1: I love this one because it's pretty much foreshadowing Act 6 and in a really beautiful way.](/spoiler)

&gt;[15](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003701). [S] WV?: Rise up.: We finally get to see the battlefield and the big war that's happening. A really good worldbuilder flash.

&gt;[16](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003500). [S] John: Reunite with your loving wife and daughter.: Does this really need an explaination? HOW DO I LIIIIVE WITHOUT YOUUUU???

prettyhow,MakeupAddiction,1390524388.0,"Wow this is amazing work! I love the shading. It really looks 3D!

I'm currently taking an anatomy course, so please forgive me for pointing out a few anatomical errors. 

1. **Jaw.** The top of the [mandibular ramus](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Gray176.png) (vertical part of the bottom jaw) should be U-shaped. You've drawn the condyle, but the coronal process is missing. The coronal process should be where you've currently drawn the condyle. The condyle should be further up and to the back. If you lay your fingers on the area right in front of your ear and open your jaw, you'll feel your [temporomandibular joint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint) moving. The ""ball"" of the joint is your mandibular condyle.

2. **Teeth.** When you bite down, the upper teeth will slightly overlap the bottom teeth and hide the topmost bit of the bottom teeth. Also, the maxillary teeth are generally larger than the lower teeth. Thus, the maxillary and mandibular teeth do not meet on-on-one. Rather, one maxillary tooth meets TWO lower teeth. The only exception is the last maxillary molar tooth. It only meets one bottom tooth. 

3. The zygomatic arch is incomplete, but I figured that's because you didn't want to draw the temporal bone and/or artistic license.

I hope my advice is helpful to you or anyone else who would like to replicate this look. I think with a couple of tweaks it will be even more realistic!
 
Edit: I just googled Rick Genest and noticed he had the same errors. I guess he should've consulted an anatomist first haha!"

oh-the-vogonity,Advice,1390524651.0,"The texture of bell peppers, and celery, and lettuce, and onion in particular is just awful. I can't do it. Fresh tomato with skin is icky as well ugh just thinking about it is gross. 

There's other things that I don't have an extreme aversion to but I'm just not a big fan of- like steamed broccoli or cooked carrots or mashed potatoes that are lumpy or mushrooms that are cooked a certain way. Ugh and if I want to eat a fresh orange it's more like me just sucking the juice out cause that much pulp makes me gag- however orange juice with pulp in it doesn't bother me.

After I realized I was avoiding a lot of potentially good dishes I experimented a lot. Like with tomatoes I realized I didn't like the texture raw but sundried tomatoes were fine. Carrots that were cooked in chunks were bleh but if they were fine slivers from a potato peeler it was just fine.  I'm alright with bell peppers if they are cooked thoroughly- beyond the point of recognition. 

Other stuff I have to blend and make into sauces or juices or make a broth with it. I like to blend things up and make flavored rice sometimes- like one part rice one part water one part blended stuff (granted that its kind of watery to begin with). I made orange and beet rice, weird as shit I know but it tasted good with butter and came out a really cool color.

But the real question is why Melisandre thinks Stannis is Azor Ahai if she knows his sword is a sham. Is it possible that she thinks she has really created Lightbringer? That the prophecy foretold of a glowing sword that only glowed due to parlor tricks?

Likewise the $6 trillion in debt added under Obama.

The problem is that it would require an across the board tax increase of about 60% - on everyone.  Of course if you raise taxes that much, you'll destroy the economy, and collect far less than the increase - which means the increase needs to be even more, which would have even worse effects on the economy.  You really can't escape the Laffer Curve.

The difference between you and I though is that I have sourced my quotes about what Kryptonite does:

[""The most common form of Kryptonite. In superpowered Kryptonians, causes immediate physical pain and debilitation, reduces their powers, and kills within hours.(Except Superman's body according to Smallville can reject it before death as seen in the episode Void when Clark is injected by Kryptonite.)""](http://superman.wikia.com/wiki/Kryptonite)

[""When exposed to Green Kryptonite, super-powered Kryptonians instantly become weak. With prolonged exposure, they die. Green Kryptonite has this effect because the interaction between two substances: its radiation and the Kryptonian's cells.""](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/comic-books/kryptonite1.htm)

OttomanRose,AdviceAnimals,1390527341.0,"When I started dating my boyfriend, I knew that he smoked weed daily and I smoked with him sometimes. 

At the time, I didn't think anything of it. As the relationship progressed, I started to see how actually dependent he was in it. For example, we couldn't go on long drives without him smoking bowl after bowl in the car, even if he was driving. (It was my job as the passenger to pack his road bowl.) The last straw was when we went hiking with a friend, and we had to stop every few minutes for my bf to step off the trail and smoke. Then, before we left, he had to pack a bowl for the drive home on windy cliffside roads in the dark (he was driving). I was really uncomfortable with the idea, and it was awkward asking him, in front of our stoner friend, not to drive us home stoned. We argued and he didn't smoke the last bowl, and I spent the ride home terrified we'd fall off Hwy 1 into the ocean.

So yeah, I gave home an ultimatum. The goal wasn't to manipulate him into doing what I want. Rather, I knew I couldn't stick around with someone who is high from the moment he wakes until he goes to sleep at 9pm, but I wanted to give him the option to try and salvage things. 

He's now been sober from pot for 8 months, our relationship is great, and since stopping he's started his own business, become actively involved in an extreme sport, and claims to be really glad he took a break from smoking.

I'm not saying ultimatums are a good thing. But, between dumping somebody you love without giving them any choice, or voicing your needs and giving them the chance to make a compromise, I prefer the latter.

tl;dr: relationships are complicated, so simple rules like ""ultimatums are poison to a relationship"" will not always be valid"

- I'd say about 90% were shitty one liners
- I said it in the very beginning of my profile that I'm not responding to shitty one liners and I didn't
- I responded to all other messages, sometimes only with something like ""Thanks for your message, but I'm not interested"" (sometimes giving a reason why not)
- I messaged quite a few guys (high matches only though) and that's how I got my wonderful boyfriend whom I've been dating or almost 6 months now. Strategy? Said something nice, mentioned something that I liked about their profile. Not too long, but long enough to show that I actually read the profile.
- I've never messaged guys who had a pic of them surrounded by girls. I think it's ridiculous and a huge turn off. Same goes for ""posing"" pics without a shirt on (exception are shirtless pics in a natural surrounding, like swimming), posing with a motorcycle/car/bling/...

No, it is not part of her body; it doesn't have the same DNA as her. It is, in fact, a separate human being from her - it has its own body parts, its own blood supply, its own heart and brain and nervous system. That makes it rather different from your arm. Your arm is part of your body because it consists entirely of cells made from only your DNA. A fetus, while it resides in her body, is not part of it. It's not just another organ. It's a separate human being. If it was part of her body we would all be giving birth to clones.

&gt;it's a pregnant woman and HER FETUS. She can do whatever she likes with it.

This line of reasoning always reminds of of cultures where women are viewed as property - where a man is entitled to do whatever he likes with HIS WOMAN because she's simply a possession and not a person.

I wonder how many unborn humans are female...?

&gt;If it were a human being then we'd call a pregnant woman and her fetus conjoined twins or something.

So because we don't call them something like ""conjoined twins"" that proves your argument true? Really? lol That makes no sense!

This is why I like science so much...because it gives you a definitive answer so you don't have to fall back on arguments like this. It's not ""all one person"". Medically or otherwise. "

But this is about a market where the sales of the drug will be a literal drop in the bucket whether priced high (where only a couple people can afford it) or priced where it's widely used (at a price that is orders of magnitude lower than what it's priced at in the west.)

You make zero money off these locales. But the flip side is that you lose just as much (zero) by letting someone use your patent to provide your drug for those locales.

This has nothing to do with the cost of development, and everything with pharma being a royal cunt for absolutely no monetary reason.

5 series are midsize sedans, 6 are grand touring sports car coupes, and 7 is the luxury sedan barge. 

The reason I suggested a 1 series vs a 2 series is that a 235i, although newer, will probably run above 40k. Otherwise it's just the next gen of bimmer platform. I am not really one for BMWs, however, so someone else who likes them more can probably say more.

Its not that kids from poor backgrounds don't get breaks or are hated. In fact, a significant chunk of NFL and NBA (especially the later) come from poorer backgrounds. Basketball instead of soccer is more of the regular man's sport. Basketball courts can be found in any inner city and are often one of the few safe means of recreation for those kids growing up. Theres a reason many NBA players come from the inner cities. Think of it this way, in Brazil most of the kids in the poor neighborhoods play soccer as their means of entertainment (and thus many great Brazilian players grew up poor) whereas in the US the same situation occurs only with basketball. You just need a court and a ball.

Whereas soccer is a sport that is still growing and its growth is occurring primarily in the suburban communities. Kids in the inner cities have very little exposure to international games whereas a kid in the suburbs is more likely to be intuned to it. I've spent a lot of time in the inner cities and the non-Hispanic kids there know very little about soccer. Its not that they're not being given a break or a chance, its just not something that them and their families know much about. Money is a factor, but there are plenty of prep basketball programs as well. In the inner city where there is always a hoop/court nearby, basketball is the sport you play. In the suburbs, with their expansive fields, its soccer. The one exception being Hispanic kids.

Its a complex situation that you clearly have no grasp of. Lets not make sweeping declarations on issues that are outside of our experiences."

I live in Michigan so I'm surrounded by fresh water. I use to be on the swim team so I'm a strong swimmer but I'm *terrified* of open water. One summer during shark week (which I'd learned about bull sharks in fresh water) I was at my cottage on Lake Huron when my dad convinced my sister and I to go on a raft on the back of the boat out on the lake. Sooner than later I fell off a couple miles away from shore. Waiting for the boat to turn around and grab me when I notice a flash of tan beneath me. Looking below I suddenly realized something big and grey-tan was beneath me, and I started shrieking. Full out blood curling scream about how there was a lemon shark beneath me and started swimming for my life towards the boat. Once I got into it I realized everyone was laughing at me so of course I got upset, since my life had been clearly in danger of a shark attack in the middle of the Midwest! Well, until they pointed out that I had been swimming above a sandbar, and if I hadn't been swimming like no tomorrow and had put my feet down it would have only been 3 feet deep. &gt;///&gt; 

They still tease me about it years later. Last New Years my dad messaged me about how they caught a shark in one of the Great Lakes and I told everyone at the party I was at, boasting about how I knew there were sharks here all along. He was lying of course. Oy. xD

As far as your transmission, have you rebuilt transmissions before? Do you know what you are getting into? It's nothing like rebuilding a carburetor. Do you have all the tools to rebuild the transmission?

A basic overhaul kit for manuals comes with seals, gaskets, bearing, synchronizers and a few other things. Usually it's not going to come with shafts or gears or anything like that.

Girdon_Freeman,WritingPrompts,1390529918.0,"We had been told that it was a safe place. An armory full of guns, a large recreation area, we even had a damn pool! But nothing could stop the threat of overpopulation. 

Our overseer locked the doors to the armory, and restricted our access to it via a terminal in his office. I remember that day. I was relaxing in the pool, minding my own business, when I heard the overseer come over the intercom. 

""In an event of violence, I am sealing the armory. The only people with access to it are me and any Vault Security personnel. That is all.""

""Did he just say what I think he said?"" one of the more... 'explosive' members of the vault said. 
""Yeah, but the Overseer probably has a good reason for it.""
""Screw good reasons, I'm grabbing my guns and headed out of here.""

Little did I know, a faction inside the vault, adhering to similar principles as my pool-mate and neighbor, splintered off from our humble group, taking most of our explosives with them. A violent struggle between the Security and the Boomers was the only thing keeping them from stealing everything. 

A few weeks after that, I noticed my Geiger counter on my Pip-boy began beeping. I checked the water, and, sure enough, it was irradiated. I dried myself off and headed upstairs. 

However, as I got closer to the Overseer's office, I began to feel weaker. I checked my rad levels, revealing that I was being exposed to a large amount of radiation. 

The source of said radiation was from a ghoulish figure staring me straight in the face. I punched him in the nose and he fell down the stairs, but miraculously got back up. I ran through the door, locked it, and ran in the direction of the armory. Through the corridors, I saw people mauled, marauded, and being massacred left and right. I ignored them, focused on my own survival over theirs'.

I saw a dead guard, with a 10 mm handgun by his side. I grabbed it, checked the magazine and continued down the hallway. Face to face, staring at me with a glazed-over expression in its eyes, was another ghoul. I shot it in the head with all but one of my bullets, and continued on through the hallway. 

I saw a doorway. The doorway to the armory.

I ran towards it, but it began shutting. I was almost there when I tried to slide under it. 

My lower half was crushed, the medkit I had stored earlier and handgun resting just out of my reach. Deciding my fate would be better if I just ended it all, I eschewed the medkit and headed for the handgun. 

With each agonizing crawl, my body felt closer to death. When I finally reached the handgun, I felt relieved. I turned it on myself, and pulled the trigger.""

The Courier read the note, then muttered a silent prayer. He grabbed the handgun, intending to jury-rig his SMG with it, and began searching through the medkit found near the rusted-shut door, found a stimpak, some steady, and...

some Med-X.

Lucindana,AskWomen,1390529932.0,"I was in the same boat as you: I thought our relationship would never end. We ended up breaking up twice, with him being the one to end the relationship both times.

It blind-sighted me the first time, but I had an inkling of an idea that something was wrong before the second time rolled around. Both times, though, friends, expressing my hurt, and mentally disassociating myself with the whole thing really helped. I first cried and cried, but I did it alone. As I started to get better, I reached out to my friends, who were wonderfully supportive and caring. And through the whole thing, I pictured someone better. Honestly, this is what helped me the most. Picturing someone that can make me so much happier than he could. Trying to remember all the cons about him, or all the little things you wished he hadn't done or said, and then making someone up for me to fall in love with again.

I know this may sound weird, but it really helped me. I think during this time it's really easy to revert back to only the good memories and forget about the bad ones.

But their point was that because the news consists of a lot of this trivial celebrity gossip type stuff, rather than informing the citizenry of important social, economic, and political issues, those issues continue worsening and go unaddressed. So, the government can continue to fuck the population without the population being informed about the details. This was also the most probable point of the entire posting of the video in the first place.

But see what you want, I guess."
psychicsword,funny,1390530673.0,If you get your news from a single source then you are going to have that bias regardless of which source you end up picking. Unknowingly biased articles is a far worse problem to have because it is much harder to supplement the missing view without going to an equally biased source which is much harder to find the time to do. As long as you mix other sources of news in the mix you will be better off than picking any single one and knowing the bias make it easier to settle the conflicting views.

Street and goth ninja are a little extreme for me, but the options in the middle ground are seemingly endless. I'd say you shouldn't blame the forum; blame society. Some environments allow less leeway than others, and it sounds like you're just stuck in restrictive environment. My occupation(s) allow opportunities to go in any fashion direction I please. Dressing appropriately is always paramount and offers it's own fun challenges, and don't forget...you can dress however you like on *your* time! 

Another thing I've noticed is that, as an outsider looking in, it seems the higher you go in the business world, the less you can do with your attire. Then, suddenly, you breach a certain threshold of success where you are allowed to go crazy again (when you're so important that outside pressures are nonexistent).  If big, bold fashion statements are your thing, the business world isn't going to offer you much for quite some time because that's where subtlety reigns supreme. *Cue business card scene from American Psycho.*

I think that this is a good thing. You shouldn't be completely fucked if you happen to live to 85 when you thought you'd only live to 80.

The problem is, with an increase in life expectancy, Social Security has turned from ""Here's something to live on if you outlive your retirement savings"" to a dole. It's not sustainable, especially since average life expectancy of people of retirement age being [20 years](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4c6.html) today versus [12 years](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/lifetables/life39-41_acturial.pdf) (Warning: 154-page PDF.

Except, as chance would have it, my family does speak the language. The men are complaining loudly about the wait time in a conversation that included the lines ""Ohmygod, I really need to poop!"" with the other saying ""Hold your shit!"" There were also some entertaining facial expressions accompanying these exclamations.  Eventually it got to the point where we just HAD to laugh and then they realized we were laughing at them... They were completely quiet the rest of the time. :P The surrounding strangers in line thought we were super weird for laughing so much!

I don't know what more a team can do than be a top seed in the Western conference... so I'm gonna have to say Stotts has been overachieving more and has been getting more from his players. Easily.

&gt;Also you are on the fucking suns board as a non suns fan and you accuse me of homerism? The fuck?

I'm not a fan of either team and I happened to stumble on this thread. There are no rules stating non-suns fans cannot comment and I have no idea why you seem to have a problem with it. If I interrupted your little circle jerk here on /r/suns about Hornacek then I apologize. 

&gt;Not to mention we have beaten portland 2/3 times we faced them.

This means nothing. Just because a team beats another team does not mean they are better than them. You guys have lost to the Nets, Sacramento twice in a row, the Jazz, and the Knicks just to name a few.

&gt;But in terms of who has done more, hornacek is in a world of his own.

No. Stotts has done more. Top seed in the Western conference. Hornacek has been very impressive but Stotts has done more.

&gt;Maybe you can address the fact that the blazers players have played with eachother for more then a year vs the suns who had only 3 players on the 2013-2014 were on our opening day roster last year. Or the fact that we played an entire training camp with players we traded less then a week before the first game of the season?

You can come up with a million reasons to why you think Hornacek is better and I can come up with two million right back at you. Hornacek is a fantastic coach, but Stotts is right up there with him.

No, where are you *really* from?"" day in and day out, no many how many generations earlier their parents had moved to the US, based on their appearance alone. And honestly, as it's been said in this thread a few other times, based on appearance, most Japanese are likely to think that as a foreigner, you're just here on some sort of short-term work or travel stint. It's not like we're walking around with name badges that show how long we've lived there, right? 

I just hope that those who do complain about the chopstick compliments understand how much it sucks being on the other end of the stick if and when they do return to their home country.

ed8020,Fallout,1390532421.0,"&gt;Gun battles are only a fraction of Fallout

Go to the Fallout Nexus. Gun mods beat Gameplay Effect / Changes  mods 25 to 17 and those are the 2 highest, the next being Armor at 10.. The first mod that most new modders work on is a gun mod. The biggest change away from it's ""roots"" was to make it FP. 

Gun battles are the majority of encounters. It's what drives the vast majority of leveling. Fallout IS a shooter, it's just a piss poor one. Everything that makes it a great RPG is completely unrelated to the shooter aspect. The writing, the detail of the world, the character development, well, except for the part where you need to kill a whole lot of shit to level up.

namkash,science,1390532428.0,"Universe must change, it has to be in constant movement. If something starts to stay static it eventually will be affected with something else that will ""push"" it. Why is it moving? Because the universe is expanding, according to the Big Bang theory (that's a theory, but the universe moves and that's a fact). Energy will always find a way to move, spread, dissipate. So it's not about ""organization"", it's about finding the *easiest* way to move; eventually it will become a system, which we may see as organized.

How do they ""know""?: is nature of energy, as I said, to find a way of changing. *It* doesn't know, it just does.

According to evolution, living beings will change to use energy in more efficient ways (I understand energy as the life process, since born, reproduction, until death). But many beings will change in different ways, according to environment conditions. Enthropy doesn't judge, or selects, it's part of the environment. So, the ramp is there, but there are many things that can roll down: egg shape things, tubes, cubes, metallic spheres, cones... The first one to stay will be the cube, perhaps tubes and cones roll more until they get stuck... At the end, if the conditons let, the egg shape thing and the metallic sphere make it all the way down, just that the sphere made it first. What if at the end there's water? The sphere will sink, because it's metallic; the egg shape thing may float, I don't know.

Now, why does universe behave that way? Always changing, never static? I can't explain, I don't know enough to do. That's Quantum matter."

winged_venus,TwoXChromosomes,1390532715.0,"You're right, in many cultures, touching IS a cultural thing, and maybe that's why he was apologizing when it was pointed out to him.  No, its not ok, because you have different cultural boundaries, but you handled it well.  Thankfully, you didn't overreact.  We do have to be understanding when cultures meet and maybe clash.  Practice tolerance!  

Communicating through touch is known as ""Haptic Communication.'  Haptic communication is observed to be heavy in many indigenous populations, and touching is treated very differently by different countries and cultures.  Brazil is an example that could be called 'touchy-feely' by North Americans.  Argentinians will hug and kiss you even if you are meeting for the first time.  These are examples of 'Contact Cultures' in which touch and physical contact is the norm.

Examples of 'Non-Contact Cultures' are German, Scandinavian, Japanese.  America falls in the middle.  

It would help to know what part of the world he was from, and then you could know if he came from a 'contact culture' or was just taking advantage of the situation.

The thing about Firedancer is that he makes you want to play more burn so you can throw it at your opponent.  A normal Standard RDW deck has something like 6-9 burn spells that can go at the opponent's face (Mizzium Mortars can't).  Are you going to play Firedancer in a deck with 4 Lightning Strikes and 3 Magma Jets?  Probably not.  Legacy Burn isn't a tier 1 deck, and I don't think a 1/1 creature is the card that's going to make the deck viable against Sneak/Show, RUG Delver, or Stoneblade.

While we've opened up a bit over the years, we still do many things on these days simply because we assume we're supposed to.

The issue you seem to have isn't really about the event itself, but the people. Remember that, if your family really hasn't heard from you in a year, then your parents definitely want to know what's happened with your life (either out of concern for your well-being, or to confirm that they didn't screw up as parents). As to the other small-talk topics (the boring repetitive ones like weather), they may not know what to talk about with you, also because of the lack of contact.

tandeg,LiverpoolFC,1390533342.0,"Probably because you're wrong. Look, I'm a Liverpool fan, and I like Sterling, but stats don't tell the full story. First of all, I'm not a fan of the ""dribble"" statistic, because it's not very accurate. Januzaj beats his man more often than Sterling. Mostly because he tends to drift out wide a lot, while Sterling tends to cut inside, but I just don't believe that dribbling stat.

Somewhat related, Januzaj is a lot more direct in attack. He gets the defenders on their heels, and uses his pace a dribbling skills to catch them off balance, whereas Sterling tends to drag the tempo down a lot more, and not utilizing his pace as well (he has gotten a lot better in this regard recently though).

Januzaj is also a much, much better finisher than Sterling. All of Sterling's goals have been tap-ins, and some of them still only barely went in. Januzaj has had some great attempts from distance, just missing the target, but that's still only recorded as a shot (as you can see he has more attempts but less accuracy).

I think Sterling can be a good, possibly great player. Right now though, Januzaj definitely looks the better talent. These stats do not in any way indicate otherwise. Not only do they not tell the whole story, they're actually very similar."

Having a nickname that is primarily used gives your kid a unique identity while preserving the family connection, and he woulld be the fourth of his name, that's special!  Both the names we have picked out and every girls name I've ever liked I chose for the meaning of the full name and the sound of the nickname they would actually go by.  I like that there is some depth and complexity to it.

As far as teasing, there was nothing funny about my name (which is super common) and I still got called names and teased plenty.  Kids will always find a reason, so this isn't a good reason to deny your kid an awesome connection to his dad.  He could have an un-teasable name like mine and they'll just call him ugly, or short, or fat or tall or skinny or ANYTHING.  You just can't get hung up on it.

dewprisms,relationships,1390533849.0,"It basically boils down to that it's because as a society we're told that men only do manly things- they're dominant, especially over women, they wear manly clothes, they do manly rugged things, and if they don't they're somehow lesser men.

If you don't subscribe to gender norms or roles, or at least don't care about pushing the boundaries, it's not going to have the same affect on you. There is nothing literally inherently feminine about what is typically considered women's clothing- that is all societal construct. The only thing that could be considered inherently feminine about being penetrated is that because of the way our biological reproductive systems work the woman must be penetrated by the man. However, anal sex is obviously not for reproduction, nor is a lot of sex in general anymore. It's about more than just reproduction.

Because this is a heterosexual relationship despite the OP being bisexual, this issue obviously comes out. However, if this were a gay couple, would he be somehow less manly if he was the receiving partner? Some people view it that way, but many people argue that there is an inherent power in being the submissive or bottom- you control the situation by providing consent and making the terms for what is and is not allowed, for example.

I don't think you're crazy. I think that these beliefs are so ingrained into us from birth by society, and since so many people as a unit ascribe to these beliefs, it's difficult to break the mold, even just in how you think about things."

We need better sex ed in schools, we have to lobby behind social programs designed to help people look after their kids (cheap housing, family benefits, etc. - we have a bunch of them here in Ontario and it's awesome), women of any age seeking to have their tubes tied need to be given the surgery instead of being told, ""No, you'll change your mind!"", and birth control has to be something people can get easily and within their means. If you don't want a child there are better ways to keep that from happening than having an abortion, when there are so many good ways to prevent pregnancy in the first place now. And along with that - pharmacists who won't give women birth control or Plan B because ""it violates my conscience!"". There should be no second chance for these folks...you do it once, you lose your license and you no longer get to be a pharmacist because you have disqualified yourself by being such a putz.

Issues that affect men, even though I'm a woman - more men than women are homeless, more men than women commit suicide, men's health issues receive almost no public attention and only a fraction of the funding that women's issues do, there are no domestic shelters for men and male DV victims are without support, etc. Not enough is being done about it...whenever I bring these these issues up on the feminist forums, one of three things happens: I get told ""feminists care about those issues too"" but nobody ever shows me what's being done about it; I get a snotty ""what about teh menz"" comment or six and enough downvotes to bury me; or I get my comment deleted for ""derailing"". It pisses me off. These are valid and important issues, and they have to be fixed."

I absolutely swear by it.  Last time I had HG so I'm not talking mild nausea treatment either.

1. I think it does mildly increase my afternoon fatigue, but doesn't require a nap, and it's nothing even remotely comparable to the gravol drowsies and ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT!

2. You don't have to take it with food, it has a time release coating so you take it before bed and it is in effect when you wake up in the a.m.  Doesn't upset my stomach, I just take with water when I brush my teeth before bed.

3. I haven't used any others but my understanding is that it is the most effective and safest for use during pregnancy by comparison.

4. Because of the delayed release you take them approximately every 8 hours to keep it in effect, so typical full dose is 2 before bed, one in the morning, one around lunch.  Your dose will depend on what you need, I don't need the lunchtime dose because I feel fine in the evenings, but I definitely need the double dose at bedtime to manage my morning.

5. Because of the time delay it can be necessary to take something else like gravol in order to keep it down the first time, or to manage breakthrough vomiting.  I have definitely done so, but not very often and not past the worst of the first trimester.  "

theforgottenpeen,nutrition,1390535146.0,"Try tracking your fat intake for a few days. Ive had many stomach and GI troubles for years, most notably constipation *except* when traveling. Eating stupid amounts of broccoli never even helped me. This past fall I started calorie counting, and instantly found out I was eating way too little fat (30g a day max for a 150lb male) and all of it was coming from small amounts in various things, and peanut butter. I started playing with my diet, eating boneless skinless chicken boobies less and eating some ground sirloin/salmon/pork loins in combination with lean meats, discovered coconut oil, stopped throwing out the yolks, etc. My stomach improved almost overnight. It suddenly made sense why traveling = shitting. I usually get spoiled like crazy by parents/sister on family vacations. I run marathons, so they do all they can to stuff me full of cake! As a result though, I've probably become far more healthy with varying my diet more.



To get things moving when issues arise, though, I usually:

* Eat hella spicy food (think Thai chilies in you eggs)

* Prunes (props) or pumpkin+blueberries added to my yogurt

* Broccoli

* Stop eating chicken altogether (I only buy the thighs/breasts as boneless and skinless-so this is why)

* Go out for ice cream at my local shop-they use 17% butterfat...for reference, haagen dazs is 15%. This alone cured me many times when I came home from uni

* More broccoli, seriously"
FuckESPN,CFB,1390535148.0,"Depends. Some crazies think we should just up and fire Dabo and give Morris the job. For all I know, that would be in the best interest of our football team and Morris is the next coming of Jesus as far as to-be head coaches are concerned. Even if he was, and it would guarantee us 50 National Championships, I'd still think it was a bullshit move and incredibly disrespectful to a guy who has done things the ""right"" way. Dabo took less pay to get his coaching staff together in the first place, and I think both the University, its fans, and his staff owe a **lot** to the man for all he has done for our school and the athlete's he has charge of. He publicly told Sammy to GTFO and go get his paycheck - the man really cares about the kids more than his W-L record, I like that. Especially 'cause he also brings one hell of a W-L record (compared to Tommy, who was a ""good dude"" but not the best coach).

I have yet to find a single human, Carolina fan or otherwise, who dislikes Dabo as a person and actually knows anything about him. Dude is goofy, says some silly shit from time to time, but in all respects he's a pretty lovable guy. There is some douchebag Ohio State fan I tagged a while back as ""hating dabo just cause of his name"" or some such. Anyway - he really is, by all accounts, a good person. So I doubt on a human level people like Chad more than Dabo, but from a coaching perspective some people think he's better (despite having absolutely no tangible proof of this).

**TL;DR:** No, unless they're delusional and/or psychic."

msobelle,hiking,1390535280.0,"March isn't the best time to go to the park or to camp. Accessibility of the areas will be limited to the National Forest part and the coastal region (Hoh, Ruby Beach). Hurricane Ridge is not accessible. As far as backup areas in that area, you are going to have significant snowpack in the Cascades that will also hinder hiking/camping.

However, if you are set on going out to the peninsula, I recommend visiting the Makah reservation and Cape Flattery. Very friendly area and super scenic. Delicious smoked salmon too.

If this is the only time you plan to go to the Olympics, I would wait til summer when it is accessible. I lived there for a year and was surprised at how inaccessible the mountains were because of the snow. Tried camping in the Olympics during that same of year...the slushy snow, wet wood, and cold damp temperatures made it the most miserable camping experience ever.

Don't overlook Mt. Rainier as a day trip option. Crystal Mountain skiing might still be open. There is also White Pass. There's also Mt. Hood. Of course, it all depends on good weather...

A note about the temp you are seeing for the peninsula...that's going to be at low elevations and is misleading. I suggest you look at the NPS webpage and check out the seasons/when to visit section. The Hoh rainforest is beautiful any time of the year, but it is very wet. You also will not have any mountain views. The rocks along the coast from Ruby Beach up to Cape Flattery will be picturesque, and the tide pools are awesome if you time your visit with low tide. You can do the circle drive from Seattle and back in one long day.

ALSO, it is really important that you know as a visitor to Puget Sound that it has traffic that is very different from other parts of the country. The traffic starts very early (5am) and ends at 10am. It starts again between 2 and 3pm and ends after 7pm. The traffic stretches from Olympia all the way up to Everett and west to North Bend. And no, I am not exaggerating. As someone that is from Atlanta, GA who has driven in traffic in LA, DC, NYC, and Boston...Puget Sound is different. Fair warning to you to plan your day accordingly."

You can always create a USMT package to do a more thorough data backup, and it can be automated and scheduled or user-initiated with the same package as well.  I've seen lots of organizations use these two tools to keep user data backed up and/or completely off of the workstations and laptops.  This setup also means that if you ever introduce terminal services or VDI, the users would be able to have access to their data from there as well without any real additional configuration.  Add in things like UE-V or appsense and the user's ""personality"" can be backed up as well - profile configuration, desktop wallpaper, icons, application settings, etc.  Obviously those additions cost money, but they add value.  You just have to determine if you want to stop at data safety, or if you want to top that off with true user mobility.  There's no right or wrong answer, but you always want to make sure you're **adding** functionality with purchased products, not *replacing* it (unless there's a darn good reason to do so).

Any time you can use 1st party tools or leverage built-in capability, you should do so.  This is one area that you can likely do that and still meet your initial goals.  If you want data to replicate to other sites, DFS can even be used on the file servers, although this can affect performance of client-side indexing if Offline Files is disabled.  Since you'd be using Offline Files on redirected folders given the scenario you mention, this wouldn't necessarily be an issue."

ulvok_coven,Fantasy,1390535944.0,"&gt; I find it interesting that the term ""grimdark,"" initially used satirically, has apparently grown some cachet as a non-ironic descriptor... Makes me think we need a new literary term for relentless misery-slogs with swords and magic.

Let's talk briefly about 'grimdark,' and its coiner, WH40k.

In 40k, even the 'good' characters are misguided. In a game where you can play any race, the only way the story manages to engender sympathy is by dehumanizing everyone else. Everyone is a murderer. Everyone is a racist. Everyone is paranoid. And everyone can die. There are only villains, and their lives are sad and terrible, with brief shining moments of blood-soaked glory followed by being torn to shreds by things that chase you in nightmares.

Let's put it this way - the 'funny' race has a slave race which runs their economy, but primarily exists to be used as battlefield rations. The 'protagonist' race has developed an entire class of technology for making a world dead and uninhabitable, and they use it *against their own citizens* more than against their enemies.

Erikson and Martin write grimdark. I don't think Abercrombie qualifies. Donaldson just might. Some of the Elric of Melnibone books might qualify. 

&gt; It isn't the presence of death, misery, grit, piss, blood, and angst that makes for unbearable fantasy. It's the impossibility of joy. It's the refusal to reflect. The failure to find the beautiful cracks in the dark walls. The inability to flog more than one emotional note.

I think Lynch is just wrong. Joy is possible, it's always possible. But underlying all of 40k is its absolute *futility.* The Imperium feels joy when it successfully dispatches millions of Tau. The Dark Eldar feel joy when they strip the skin off of children, even if does just the least bit to stave off Slaanesh from devouring them. I would imagine the Tyranids feel joy... and even if they don't, their players love feeding enemies to their titanic monsters.

Martin does it by focusing on physical pleasures and conceptions of glory. Erikson does it in the moment - it doesn't matter if it's futile in the end, all that matters is the soldier beside you.

I think Lynch is reacting against a stereotype and nothing real. I don't think there are stylistic waves of this kind in fantasy. There's always been dark fantasy - Moorcock is almost ten years older than Robert Jordan, for example. And Bram Stoker predates them both. Hell, Lovecraft is probably an even better ur-example of grimdark, and he's two years older than *Tolkein.*

I think gritty fantasy is popular because there's good people writing it. Abercrombie, Bakker, etc. But Rothfuss, for example, isn't. Kingkiller is sad but it is a fairytale in tone. And Lynch obviously isn't. Aren't Kingkiller and Bastards more popular than... you know, *anything* on the market right now?"

Snipers_kanga_wife,dayz,1390536127.0,"&gt; That's how I think everybody should feel about their character.

&gt; my usual reaction is to just not do it and get shot

This infuriates me. So many people on this subreddit cry out at the devs saying that *they* need to add value to characters' lives, when the problem lies with the players who don't add any value to their own character's life.

I'm one of those people who

&gt; feel like I'll do it as long as he/she lets my character live.

And you know why? Not because my character has learnt skills from books, not because i have an awesome beard, but becasue *I personally add value to my character's life*. It's not that hard. If you want to feel like not dying, then literally all you have to do is *make that your goal*. Try to not die.

Adding beards or skills will not help at all if you don't care about beards and skills. Beards and skills are things associated with your character that you lose upon death. Guess what else does that? Gear.

I see *no* point in adding beards to this game. People say it will give them a reason to try to live for as long as possible. But isn't holding this opinion:

&gt; Its essential that your characters life should have value

reason enough to add value to your character yourself? I have only died once since release day, not because the **developers** added something to **make** me love my character, but because **I chose** to love my character."

MissesDreadful,keto,1390536287.0,"I will give you the perfect recipe for a Super Bowl dip. This has been my absolute favorite for YEARS, and it goes with just about everything you may want to dip in it. And total keto friendly.


1 block of softened cream cheese (8 oz.)

3 medium avocados (or the equivalent of larger.. really it's just how much avocado you like compared to the cream cheese)

1 medium tomato chopped small 

Garlic powder to taste


Break up the avocado (not too much, it'll get broken down a bit more when you mix it with the cream cheese). Mash the cream cheese, then mix in the avocado. You don't want it to be completely smooth. Fold in tomatoes and garlic powder. Serve with your dipping implement of choice. 

Nutrition data for the whole thing is: 85.5g fat, 12 net carbs, 17 g protein

There's little to no attention to the ""thuggery"" of the NHL, because the sports allows that aggression. Therefore people are not inclined to go up in arms over the fights and ""thuggery"" that happened in Calgary and Vancouver. It's a part of the sport, it's in the rules.

cluberti,sysadmin,1390536651.0,"To be fair, the first two places you mentioned would be considered ""small"" businesses (in fact the first one would be considered a ""micro business""), and your current job would officially be a ""medium"" sized business, but only barely.  I don't consider any employer with less than 250 employees a ""medium"" sized business, only because I've worked in a lot of small and medium sized businesses, and the attitude towards IT usually doesn't change to something more reasonable until the headcount gets north of 3-400 users, sometimes even more.

To be fair, small business environments can be awesome places to work, but in my experience they usually are not.  They are usually cheap, treat IT like the janitor, and you'll find your share of complete jerks running important parts of the ship.  Not easy to avoid when it's a small organization, especially if IT is just one or two people.  If you like the small business mindset, find a good small business, and can live with the pay, by all means do so.  If you want to get into a job with responsibilities not mired in fantasy land, you might need to consider a job with a bigger company.

SentientBagOfWater,AskMen,1390536867.0,"I think there are three important classes of things that are on display.  Design, memories and expressions of yourself.  It sounds like you're taking the design element in hand, and since it's a tricky area I won't really comment there.

In terms of expressions of self the standard go-to is art.  As others have said, framed paintings or occasionally posters are the typical starting point.  Don't overdo it unless you have a really cavernous room to fill.  I have one painting (well, print) on my bedroom wall, in a style that I find fascinating, and framed to go reasonably with the furniture.

Memories are important, and your trouble here is that you want a more ""adult"" look while you're only just in the process of starting to create adult memories.  As this process continues the childhood items will naturally start to be diluted by reminders of more recent times.  I cheat a little here because one corner of my bedroom acts as home office, but that currently contains a trophy I won when I was 6, a couple of items from my transformers toy collection, plaques from both my high school and my university, 3 or 4 of the more displayable souvenirs from a couple of vacations which were important to me and a small number of photographs of family and friends taken on memorable occasions.  The childhood items are balanced by other current and past interests.

The only other thing I can think of is keeping things uncluttered.  In the same way as an adult bedroom should be tidy, if whatever shelf space you have is crammed with items it will look more like storage than display.  Give each item plenty of space, don't be afraid to be brutal in your selection process.  Store the rest either to rotate out at some point, or to display elsewhere when you have other rooms to personalize.

HTH."

Mongoosen42,AskMen,1390536974.0,"Confidence is NOT being better than other people. Confidence is knowing in your heart that you are the best you that you can be, being secure in that feeling, and so not caring if and when other people think negatively about you.

Lets use dancing as a random example. Confidence doesn't mean being a great dancer, or pretending to be a great dancer, or telling everyone what an amazing dancer you are. Confidence means not caring about what other people think about your dancing. Just dance for yourself, in whatever way that makes you happy, and if other people like it then good for them and if they think it's stupid then who cares.

When I go out to clubs I dance like a fool. And I'm pretty sure I look ridiculous. I spin in circles and flail my arms, and I look pretty ridiculous. But people actually really love it. One of the best compliments I ever received was having some girl I didn't know come up to me and say ""You dance like you are in your bedroom wearing pajamas and **no one is watching you**."" THAT is what confidence is.

So, how to be confident? Whatever you do, do it for yourself. Don't do things for other people. Don't do things to get attention. Don't do things to impress a girl or get laid. Do things for yourself, do things to make yourself happy. The way other people react to you is irrelevant.

Putting this into the practice of approaching people you don't know and starting a conversation is tricky, because we all fear rejection. The key is: don't be afraid of rejection, because it doesn't matter what they think of you. If you are trying to talk to someone at a party (guy or girl) you are not doing it to make them happy. You are doing it because what makes you happy right now is talking to people you don't know. If one of those people finds you to be a repulsive human being....well that's really too bad for them that they have so much energy invested in not liking you. Must suck to be them and spend all that time not liking you. But it doesn't affect you. You got what you wanted, which was nothing more than to talk to someone you didn't know.

Make sense?"

Pozzo and Lucky function as foils for Didi and Gogo; each set is two people tied together inextricably through fate. In the first act, Pozzo claims he's going to sell Lucky, and treats him horribly, but then they're still together in the second act. I think about couples who become co-dependent when I see this play, because I think it's very much about how those type of people can only function through another person (see Lucky's ""thinking"" on command in the first act, and ""leading"" Pozzo around in the second.)

The play is also saying something about the nature of existence as a whole (the more things change, etc), and I think this is a good reflection of that. They seem to be reversed in the second act, but so much is still the same.

Again, I don't know if this is the kind of thing you're looking for, or if it would even hold up. Those are just kind of my thoughts on it."

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1390537364.0,"25) What two angles will fire a projectile 16km downrange if the initial velocity is 400m/second

x(t) = 400tcos(theta)

y(t) = -4.9t^(2) + 400tsin(theta)

y(t) yields 4.9t^(2) = 400tsin(theta), or t = 4000sin(theta)/49 when the projectile lands.

So substitute 4000sin(theta)/49 for t in the x(t) function to get:

x(t) = 400(4000sin(theta)/49)cos(theta) = (1600000/49)sin(theta)cos(theta)

We want x(t) = 16000, so 16,000 = (1600000/49)sin(theta)cos(theta)

Thus 1 = (100/49)sin(theta)cos(theta), so sin(theta)cos(theta) = 49/100.

This means that sin(2x) = 49/50, or 2x = arcsin(49/50), so x = arcsin(49/50)/2.

And then pi/2 - arcsin(49/50) should also work."

I don't think you are completely nuts at all. You can do several things to put your mind more at ease. 

If you find a good candidate from a legit agency, you can conduct a skype interview and ask them about their experience with kids. You can also invite them over an hour or so before you leave and spend some time with them to see how they interact with your kid. Another common security measure is to ask to photo copy their driver's license. 

I used to work as an on-call/substitute nanny, meaning I was constantly with strangers/new families. You can PM me if you have more questions. Unfortunately, the agency I worked for doesn't have a branch in Orlando.

You should be fine.

Crazy girls are the kind who do things that are out of left field in a bad way, that are dangerous and violent and horrible and abusive. These are girls who fake pregnancies and threaten your friends.

I've dated crazy girls and mentally ill girls. Mentally ill was fine. Crazy was not.

If it's a symptom of things, it's understandable. I've been there. But, if it's just you being over-the-top, it would be a deal-breaker.

It's a horrible thing to say, I know, but there's a limit to how much illness one can take. You sound like you're stable and nice and honestly a good person, but if right off the bat you started talking to me about how you gave birth to your cats, I'd nope the fuck out of there.

redyellowand,Entrepreneur,1390538980.0,"Meh, I've seen ""shit you can afford"" before and just because I could afford it doesn't mean I wanted to buy any of it. Offer good products, not just novelty/cheap things, and that will help you stand out. Maybe see if you can collaborate with designers (that make a product you can retail for $20) that are just starting out once your site gains some traction. Do limited availability...things. 

When I first started out, I thought I had an awesome, one of a kind product, until I found out I didn't. I looked at their prices and thought ""I can sell my stuff for less than that and still make a really good profit."" Additionally, to make my stuff stand out more, I added extra designs and different interpretations of my products. While my main product that my competitors also sell arguably gets me the most money, I also offer tons of things my competitors don't, and I'm about to expand my product line even more.

So

1) Look at the fact that you have competition as an opportunity for comparison and competition. You are not over.

2) Look at what you DONT like about your competition and improve on it. 

3) Offer interesting things, and don't be afraid to try out new offerings for a limited time. People love that shit.

Good luck and let us know how it turns out!"

It's like this.

1. You're turned on.

2. You start stroking it.

3. You don't really feel anything.

4. For a while, it's just methodic stroking.

5. Finally, you ""get into the groove"". It becomes natural, organic, you don't want to stop.

6. Cum. Cumming itself isn't incredible (It's really nice though), it's an orgasm that's good. Every now and then, and it's rare, you will be masturbating and you'll cum and it'll be like heaven opening up and an invisible shower of angelic goodness falls over you and all is right in the world. Otherwise, it's a great stress release, and lots of doctors recommend it.

Note: Don't go where you don't feel comfortable, but try and see it through to the end.

Steaming_Noggin,leaves,1390539421.0,"Hi there. I'm 36 too :)


I haven't been a smoker for as long as you have (just a few years), but it's still been a struggle to quit. Here are some ideas that might help (a lot of them are from reading other people's posts her in r/leaves), see what you think:


- Find other activities to keep yourself busy. It can be chores like cleaning, it can be going for a walk, exercising, working on some kind of hobby, etc. Sitting around doing nothing isn't as fun when you're not high, and you're less likely to miss weed so much if you're busy.
- Make a list of goals you want to achieve now that you're not going to be smoking a lot. You already have some rewards in place for yourself, with the things you'll be able to afford with the saved money, but I bet there are other things you'll be able to do also that aren't as directly connected to money.
- In your post, you talk about the fears you have about quitting, which are totally understandable. But you don't mention a lot about why you want to quit, aside from the money. Can you also identify some positive things that could change in you and your life, and really try to keep the focus on them every time you start to get afraid?
- Do you have a doctor you like who you can tell that you're making this change, so someone can be keeping an eye on you? A family member or a friend would be good too. I know that your special concerns connected with BPD are important and should be taken seriously.



It's a big step to make this change, but we're all in the same boat with you. We're here for you! Take care of yourself and keep checking in if you like, it really helps - hugs to you."

Knowing about my condition really changed the quality of my life!  I used to go into the hospital quite often for skin infections (and they were painful!) but once that Med Student picked up on the pattern and told the Doctor about Wells Syndrome (which that Doctor and many others had never even heard of) I started taking incredibly simple precautions recommended based on the newly realized cause of the infections, and I haven't had to go to the hospital since!  I will never forget when that young student explained this disease to the Doctor.  That moment is really significant in my mind as the beginning of the end of the pain I had to go through.  The first time I had to go to the hospital I was 11 years old and they had to cut a huge hole in my armpit!  It was just absolutely terrible.  From then until I was 19 I had to have some part of me cut open and drained about once a year.  Now I am 26 and haven't had anything serious enough to need medical attention in 7 years!!!  Anyway, thank you for being dedicated!  I never really got to thank the med student that diagnosed me, because at the time I had no idea that it would impact my life in such a positive way… So instead, I will thank you!  Thank you for being dedicated to helping people!!!! 


On a side note: it's kind of neat, because I get to tell people I'm a mutant since Wells Syndrome is a genetic mutation of the skin cells.  I have mutant skin.  Like the X-Men, except my super power is infections.   "

vorpalblab,explainlikeimfive,1390540350.0,"I have two sexual fetishes that go back to when I was pre pubescent.

1   between the ages of 5 and 14 I was punished (caned) and publicly humiliated frequently in school.

I find being in a position to punish and humiliate now to be somewhat erotic, but that situation is not necessary for arousal, and I also have empathy for the punished, and am not into dealing out much pain.  It Is more a symbolic situation of being the powerful one in the interchange if that makes any sense.

And for any eroticism - it needs to be consensual to me because my experiences were non consensual and therefore the memories were bad. I don't wanna make bad memories for anyone.

I spent a couple years in the BDSM scene in a major city, but left because I thought mostly they were a buncha posers and trendy yupsters playing like grade 6 smoking in the school yard after school, I did not wanna associate with the scene. Nothing seemed real.

The other fetish is bush.

The first naked women I saw had a full bush, and that image is burned into my brain as what a real woman should look like.

This was before Playboy magazine came out, and I do not see the super sexiness of those naked lips between the legs looking like some 12 year old girl.  

I suppose it is there now because the 12 year old boys looking at Playboy want to see what the heck was hiding under all that hair.

But smoothe is nice too, I just prefer hair.

Neither fetish is a necessity to get me off, more like an added pleasure.

I keep all the rest of my fetishes in a soft leather bag and use them in the dark od moonless night to do my shaman duties with black candles and oil of newt."

92MsNeverGoHungry,Military,1390541002.0,"In Afghanistan there's very little done to the remains.  Our primary job at that in is starting a chain of custody of all effects, getting positive ID of the remains (usually provided by a member of their unit), and ensuring prompt evacuation from theater.  (I'll note here that the identification we do in theater is considered tentative and allows us to ensure the family will see the Fallen's arrival at Dover.  Fingerprint, Dental, and DNA will provide definitive ID once they reach the Mortuary in Delaware) We do not, in theater, remove any medical interventions nor do we do anything more than inventorying everything on the body.

It's not often thought of, but anyone killed on the battlefield is a homicide victim, and their remains are treated as such.  All of our techniques are in place to preserve evidence first, and provide comfort second.  The bodies are sealed in an HRP (human remains pouch) which has a serialized security seal, covered in bags which contain 40 pounds of water ice (dry ice is colder, but can cause frostbite/burn the skin of remains just as easily as it can the living), and placed in a metal transfer case that is sealed on both ends.  Serial numbers for all three seals are written in multiple places and logged in the unlikely event of suspected tampering.

Upon arrival to Dover, the remains are first photographed by members of the FBI and then put through a full body CT scan.  This allows the techs to determine if the medical interventions were successful and how the body armor worked or whatever.  Dental scans are done and the remains are fingerprinted.  After they are disrobed they are taken into a lab where they are given an autopsy.  Every Fallen Soldier since 2004 has been autopsied without exception.  

The remains are then embalmed and reconstructed to the best of the mortician's ability while a dress uniform is constructed using their service record.  By the time the remains are viewed by the family they are fully embalmed and in their dress uniform.  The family will not see how they were brought in, though they can request a copy of the autopsy record if they desire.  Final ID is done via DNA, so it is not necessary to expose the family to their loved one looking anything less than their best."

By the end of the film we are outraged and disgusted by the things we've witnessed, and we've seen the representative of all of this be destroyed. Obviously nothing outside of this representative has changed. Obviously this one experience doesn't change anyone's mind about what's going on. But it is a work of art that has thematic value in the same way a Greek or even Shakespearian tragedy does. The character brought about his own fall through a particular tragic flaw that is alluded to throughout the work.

At 179 (in game stat) she hits twice under the buff fairly reliably with some one hits here and there. The four attacks that I stated was incorrect, but three attacks under the buff is happening for me, right now, in a custom lobby.

It's still impossible mathematically, unless the skill is bugged. Which I don't doubt. Your IAS shouldn't matter since she's given max anyway.

&gt;Also, MoC's chance gets better as she levels, meaning at a lower level of it you're always worse in the jungle than having a higher level of it, regardless of your attack speed/luck/damage.

Well, yes, but with one level only, you can't jungle forever without additional regen. If she always attacked three times with lifesteal under the buff (as you claimed), she probably could jungle for a much longer time than she can now with only one point.

You probably won't pull the trigger and hurt anyone while doing so, but you need someone to point it out to you because you don't realize that you tilted the gun the wrong way while you were setting it down.

Texas_Cloverleaf,AskMen,1390541684.0,"I feel like some of these responses are a little extreme and are more applicable to extroverts so I'm going to share my experience regarding a SO.

1. Allow yourself to feel what you miss. For me this meant creating playlists of music that I knew could draw out my emotions. You want to feel heavily and you want to feel strongly so that once you've felt as much as you can feel you can reflect on your experiences with the SO. This means remembering the good things that happened and understanding why they were good (and then taking that information and using it to better yourself in your own life) and also considering the bad, what cause the relationship to end, how were you wronged etcetera.

2. Write things down. This was the part I pushed away from the longest but it is really worthwhile. Put down your feelings for this person on paper. You've allowed yourself to feel and you've reflected so now you can clearly express what you mean. For me this meant writing down why this woman was someone I loved and what she'd meant to me, and why I was hurt and angry at her for the way things ended. In a sense you're saying these things to the person without actually having the conversation, releasing the bottleneck that comes along with the emotions.

3. This one is common to everyone, but time is the largest factor. Cutting the person out of your life isn't always necessary but immediately avoid anything that will reopen old wounds. You're reflecting, you're feeling things, you haven't moved on yet, but your getting there. You're in the process of getting your mindset to the place where its ready to move on and part of this is taking time to yourself to figure out who you are. I knew I was ready when her tweets about her boyfriend no longer bothered me.

Obviously I'm a huge proponent of reflection and self-improvement and as an introvert that's really where I feel the key lies in getting over someone. Using your inner knowledge and processes to get to the heart of the matter and allow yourself to see the situation for what it really is."

cluberti,atheism,1390542002.0,"Christians and atheists can sometimes have common ground outside of the realm of religious belief, but let's be honest here - that's not why you posted this, and it's obvious.  You say you're not here to convert anyone, yet your writing reeks of ""look, what I say is true!"" when anyone with a brain being used for logical thought and reason can easily discern that the bible is most certainly not true, and the writings in it to be the world-views of the men who wrote them.  There's no more god in the bible than there is the easter bunny in a basket.

Truth is, most atheists know more about the bible and what's actually in it than the Christians you normally congregate with.  You'll have to provide more proof that the bible contains real truth than the same book that says it's true - circular logic is not proof, it's a tool used by the less scrupulous among us to try and confuse other weak-minded people to buy what's being sold.

The bible and it's stories are generally woven around misogynistic, homophobic, genocidal, contradictory, and sometimes absolutely absurd ideas, and believers are expected to take these stories, fantasies even, at face value without rational thought or discussion into just how much of it is so.  We wouldn't behave and believe like this with any other decision in life, yet there are people like yourself who do so with the most important thing - who you are and what you stand for.  This molds almost **everything else** that you do.  So, do we have things in common?  Maybe, but probably only around helping the poor and less fortunate.  Whereas the average Christian is doing this with ulterior motives (convert the unsaved, increase the rolls of the ""kingdom""), most atheists do this because it's the right thing to do.

Saying ""we have things in common"" might be true, but it doesn't make what you believe more real, or increase the likelihood I'll start believing it.  Assuming one believes that there is a god and he is all-powerful, viewed with that lens the Christian idea of god reminds me of the relationship of a battered wife to an abusive husband - no matter how many times your god does mean, evil, childish, vengeful, despicable things, you keep going back to him because ""he only does it because he loves me"" and rationalize it away behind the ""he works in mysterious ways"" nonsense.  Normal people (I would hope) wouldn't accept seeing such ridiculous behavior in a human relationship without trying to intervene and separate the pair, but because it's god, he gets a pass."

That said, as the recipient of that message I would feel a little leery of being told my SO was in love with me so soon into a relationship. If he doesn't (yet) reciprocate those feelings (love is pretty significant!) it can make for some awkwardness between you.

If you're okay with the potential event that he hasn't moved as quickly as you have emotionally then go for it! My advice for you, however, would be to take some time to consider your feeling and whether they are legitimately love or still the infatuation that often leads to love. The words will always have more meaning when they are truly meant.

Or its possible the words have no meaning for either of you in which case go nuts!"

As men, I feel like our opinions on the subject are relatively unimportant being that abortion affects us on such a minor level, unlike how it affects women (i.e. when a woman gets pregnant whether she decides to keep the baby or get an abortion, her life has been changed considerably, whereas when a woman tells a man she is pregnant he choose to ignore the woman/child and have his life be pretty much the same as it was). It aggravates me to no end when old, usually white, people try and tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies.

I'm sure there is a name for the issue, but I don't know what it's called, where child custody courts automatically side with the mother over the father; if I ever find myself fighting an ex-wife for custody of my children I'll fight to the death - you're not taking my kids from me."

Second. **There is no shame is asking for help**. None. You have taken the first step by asking /r/relationships for help, and nobody here is passing judgement on you for asking for help. As far as having suicidal and depressive thoughts go, there is no shame in asking for help with that either. It is not your burden to bear. And as far as the money issues go, there is no shame is asking your husband for help.

Marriage is a partnership. You make a promise to help each other and have each other's backs through the good times and the bad. You are going through a rough time in your life, and your husband should be able to help you through it. And if you feel so strongly about using his money, why not borrow enough to get by and you can pay him back when you are in a more stable place in your life? You should not be worrying about starving. And just because things are financially tight for you, does not mean you need to think about ending yourself. You're financially broke: that doesn't mean things can't be fixed.

And I saw in your comments you are wondering about pawning your wedding ring. Do not do this. Your husband gave that to you as a token of your marriage. Borrow money from your husband and pay him back. Don't get rid of something that I imagine has significant emotional value for you for a quick buck.

After someone has arrived at a belief using such methods, using logic and reason to counter such belief is almost always met with such behavior.

What others have said is true, that a theory requires proof, evidence, peer review, and some form of consensus that all can point to a position without evidence (actual, not in a religious book written millenia ago) to the contrary.  The teleological theory is an argument, no more.  There's no evidence to it, only a belief that it may somehow be true.

GrnTiger08,golf,1390547118.0,"Very detailed analysis.  I've found it's easiest to hit this shot by setting the wrist on the backswing and holding it through impact and then simply turn the body through impact.  You can retain the forward lean without any wrist action and you keep a larger/shallower swing arc.  

Like the article says if you stop turning the body, the wrist angle has to release to impact the ball and gives a bit of a flip for the higher shot.  Too much weight on the target side punches the ball.  I especially like the chart.


From the article.
&gt;Set up with weight on left side – only lob (higher than high floater) would be set up with the majority of your weight to the right. Hands should be slightly forward. Clubface slightly open.

&gt;One’s body should be constantly rotating through impact. Without the body rotation through impact, you are likely to flip a bit early and hit the high floater.

&gt; Then you must hold enough lag to get near impact with some shaft lean then release so that somewhere around 5-7 degrees exists at impact. Once you have that lag, you must relax your hands/arms just before impact to stop drive/holding and let the club swing past your hands. &gt; "

It felt immense to me, and I felt like my financial future was bleak, and wondered what the point was starting out with so much built up in loans. After you leave school though, there is typically a grace period where you are under no obligation to pay anything (usually between 6 and 9 months). And there are plenty of loan repayment plans that work around your financial situation (one of my loan payment plans requires that I pay $49 a month. Even though I have a strict budget, this is manageable). So for right now, you don't need to worry about your student loans. That is for the future. Focus on the now.

You have a husband. You have a house. You have medical insurance through your husband. Have you spoken to your husband about your difficulties? Your medication is a necessity and you need food.

Check their community forums and /r/republicwireless for more on that.  Also check out Ting.

If your phones are ""practically new"" there are likely early termination fees involved.  Ting will pay 25% of them per line, up to $75.  You can also look into T-Mobile, because they pay some ETFs too."

I see the community, the fun people are having, the ease in which new people are brought in, and I realize that this could go somewhere because people here are approaching economics as a social activity!

I'd say that rather than violence, you're more likely to encounter being turned down for jobs due to not being Norwegian, or being unfairly judged by people before they get to know you. That sadly exists and there have been numerous articles linked here discussing the issue.

Plenty of folks used messianic language regarding the Obama.

Much of it is here in quotes on the right hand column.

http://obamamessiah.blogspot.com/

Obama got a stimulus, the ACA, and a raise on the wealthiest.

But nothing's ever his fault.  He has SAID he wants corporate taxes lowered...why isn't the @#$#$%%^$ doing that?

God you're such a typical lefty...Democrats don't do SHIT...but it's the Republicans' fault everything isn't fixed.

Let's quote the Messiah:

***Before he voted AGAINST raising the debt ceiling in 2006***

'The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the US Government can not pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that ""the buck stops here.""

If I don’t have this done in three years, then there’s going to be a one-term proposition.”

EmergencyTaco,AskReddit,1390553615.0,"**SPOILER ALERT, DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT LoU SPOILED** 

I'm going to say the same thing to you that I said to the person below you, but first off let me say this: you weren't supposed to sympathize with Joel. People play games these days and automatically assume that the main character is going to be the hero, but that wasn't the case in The Last of Us. Joel was a man who had everything taken from him and became a run down and depressed human being because of it. He was a smuggler just trying to survive without really wanting to. They build him up for the whole game to be this person that is helping to save the world, while simultaneously making people forget that that is never what he was doing. He was doing a job that he didn't even want to do, and it was only for the money. He never set out with the goal of saving the world, and he never really had that goal throughout the entire game, they just make it look like he did when you just glance at the story. The ending was predictable because the story led up to it and you got to experience Joel's character and could therefore make an educated guess on the choices he was going to make, but just because it wasn't a happy ending doesn't make it a bad one. The game was meant to portray how brutal, desolate and unforgiving a post-apocalyptic world could be, and that was accomplished by showing how a man is willing to forego the interest of all of mankind just to hold on to the one bit of happiness he has in his life. It shows you how utterly desperate he was and how much the world he was living in had drained him and destroyed him.  

 I fully understand not sympathizing with him, but you should at least be able to relate to him. The game's goal wasn't for you to play this guy who is a big hero that saves the world, it was to make you think. At the end of the game you immediately think ""Oh that's bullshit it was an easy choice and he should have let her die."" Then, however, if you actually start to think about it and put yourself in Joel's shoes your perspective starts to change. What would you do in his situation? It's great to say that you would just let the girl die and be the saviour of humanity, but be honest with yourself, would you? Would you have let your sister die? Your wife? Your daughter? Brother? Son? This is a man who had had one person close to him in the past 20 years, and he had just recently lost her. When someone goes through such a significant loss they try to latch onto something, anything. Ellie was that something for Joel, and in his eyes that was more important than the rest of the world.  

If you play LoU with the expectation that there's going to be some happy ending and Joel is just a typical video game protagonist that is going to beat the odds and triumph to save the world while killing a whole bunch of baddies then it really isn't the game for you. If you're not willing to break it down and look at the story by putting yourself in his shoes then you won't enjoy it and will likely think it has a shitty story. It's a game that is for significantly more mature audiences than a typical rated-M game, and isn't one that can be fully appreciated without effort.

Also, on top of that all, the controls were incredibly tight and the gameplay made you think constantly about the appropriate time to use your resources, and it wasn't at all forgiving. If you're not prepared for that it can turn people off.

-allience with portugal and then marraige.
-allience with Aaragon and eventually marraige (keep them happy and with a marraige you will eventually inherit them in a special event)
-improve relation with Navara and eventually vassal and annex.

Wars-
-Portugal in most starts declares war on Morocco, join them and stay in Castille if you want or send a few thousand men over if you wantm up to you really.
-Eventual peace and by this time the truce you had with Granada should be over leaving them open to smash as their allies cannot declare war on your due to truces from Portugal war.

Build your army again if you have any losses and you can invade some of the north africa areas, portugal might help and so will Aargon if you are still all nice and friendly allowing huge gains.

This works really well if you also manage to gain control of the holy see and you will be able to call a crusade allowing sometimes more troops from elsewhere plus combat modifiers.

Quick notes - Aargon have a so so military but their navy will wipe you off the map so do not get into naval warfare with them early on.

Eventually when you get explorers that you can send off to the new world (get them early and you should be able to get the azores before the portuguese allowing a base for expansion (in open water your ships will suffer and eventually sink so you must find a harbour to repair, get the azores and it makes things a lot easier.

BonzoTheBoss,AskHistorians,1390557804.0,"The answer to this question is quite broad, from changing opinions and policies on the Empire at home, to growing independence movements across the colonies, mainly in the ""Jewel of the Empire"", India.

But the largest contributing factor to the fall of the Empire is arguably the Second World War. Despite emerging victorious, the effects of the war were felt keenly both at home and abroad. Britain was essentially bankrupt, with absolvency only avoided in 1946 by a US$4.33 Billion loan from the United States, which was only fully paid back in 2006. With war time rationing still in effect, the British public were more concerned with affairs at home rather than maintaining an Empire which was looking more and more like a net drain on the nations resources. Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from the majority of their colonies, to dismantle an empire they no longer wanted nor could afford. In 1945 a pro-decolonisation Labour government was elected, which immediately began addressing the most pressing concern of decolonisation, Indian independence. [1][2][3][4]

Indian independence movements had been campaigning for decades by 1945, but didn't really agree on how to go about it. The Indian National Congress believed in a unified Indian secular state, whereas the Muslim League preferred a seperate state for Islamic majority regions. With mounting civil unrest, the risk of civil war and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy in 1946, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten, moved the date of Indepence forrward from 1948 to August 15th 1947.[4] After India had been granted independence it was only a matter of time before all the other colonies that wanted independence would have it.

In 1951 the Suez Canal Crisis highlighted the limitations of Britain to the world, demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act without at least the acquiescence, if not the full support, of the United States. While British power in the Middle East was weakened, it was not destroyed. Britain continued to operate in the area and station troops until a decade later.[2][5][6]

Wanting to avoid the kind of colonial war being waged by France in Algeria, between the 1950s and the 1980s decolonisation in Africa proceeded rapidly. By the end of the 1960s, all but Rhodesia (the future Zimbabwe) and the South African mandate of South West Africa (Namibia) had achieved recognised independence. In Rhodesia, the 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the white minority resulted in a civil war that lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of Zimbabwe.[4][7]

Between the 1960s and 1981, all the British colonies in the Mediterranean, Carribean, South America and Pacific Ocean would be granted independence. By 1981 other than a scattering of islands and outposts the process of decolonisation started after the Second World War was largely complete. In 1982 the invasion of the Falkland Islands by Argentina tested Britains military resolve to defend their remaining overseas territories. The resulting victory was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in Britain's status as a world power.[7]

Britain to this day retains sovereignty over fourteen ""British Overseas Territories"" (as they are officially classified as of 2002), however they are either small (sometimes unmanned) military or scientific outposts, or self-governing islands which rely on Britain for military defense and foreign relations. Some argue that this means ""the Sun still hasn't set"" on the British Empire, however how much these territories can be classed as an ""empire"" is debatable.

SigmaMu,PurplePillDebate,1390558752.0,"I view dominant/submissive along the same lines as subject/object, the dominant acts according to his/her will, and the submissive submits to the dominant's will. So just in the act of a man approaching a woman he's already taken the dominant role. So a truly submissive man never takes that first step, or takes it rarely, being entirely unaccustomed to it. The woman sees him as submissive through his show of dominance and rejects him: The plight of the lonely beta. 

The general advice given to men about dating is ""Be confident."" Of course, if you were actually confident, you wouldn't need advice in the first place. So the implication is ""Fake it til you make it."" or ""Yes you're submissive, but mold yourself into a dominant, and women will respond.""

As for women who like submissive men, more power too you. Being outside the norms of attraction means you get much less competition, and can have your pick, like chubby chasers. Hell, there's probably significant overlap."

 I actually did have quite a bit more written but just erased it. 

&gt;What is it that makes people decide that they are one or the other.

The first thing you have to understand is that it's NOT a choice. 

The next is that the person someone is on the inside, the way they feel about themselves and how they react to society and how it treats them, does not necessarily equate to the person they are on the outside, what they project into society and how society reacts to it AND society's expectations. Just as one tiny, miniscule, almost microscopic example of this is a man opening a door for a woman. 

Hell, the whole concept of chivalry is the biggest example of ""masculinity"" or ""The male role model"" that I can give you. It's a rather obvious one. But back to my point, the two versions of us, the inner and outer.

Fuck it. I just realized what an IMMENSE waste of my time this is. I'm repeating myself because you failed to understand it the first time, even though I put it in the simplest terms I could. Good luck, I'm out."

salami_inferno,DebateAChristian,1390564490.0,"&gt; Because if anything about Christianity is true, God is doing everything he can to prevent us from dying.

You are the ones claiming he is all powerful, he designed us this way. If he is doing everything he can to make us not do these things yet he fails then he is not all powerful. Either god has all power and is at fault or he is not all powerful and we are at fault, you can only logically pick one of those.

BonzoTheBoss,AskScienceFiction,1390565033.0,"I suppose the most obvious demonstration of this technique I can think of would be the Borg from Star Trek, and their ability to adapt to enemy weapons fire.
Borg ships don't have traditional shields the way we think of them, they cover their ships in a high energy subspace field that absorbs damage of a certain energy frequency spectrum and deflects it into subspace. When a vessel attacks them, they modulate their subspace field until the attacking vessel's weapons are essentially useless.

Certain species have been able to (temporarily) get around this by rapidly rotating their weapon frequencies through a high frequency band, but this is intensive on the power systems of the ship and the Borg eventually adapt.

This also applies for the personal shields on drones. After taking a few hits they will detect the frequency and adapt accordingly. Some speculate that kinetic and bladed weapons are most effective, but I'd argue that if a species used those all the time (and assuming the Borg would be interested enough/consider them enough of a threat to assimilate them) then drones would adapt by reinforcing their personal shields with gravitons or by creating heavy armour similar to kevlar."

All cit said was that the people cleaning your shit off the walls and the ones cooking the food were the same. never at any point did it say employees didn't wash their hands. I've worked at many pubs and the people handling your food have to clean all sorts of nasty shit, then wash their hands and then prepare your fish and chips. All they are doing is to try to gross you out of wiping you feces everywhere like the barbarians many drunk people are."

artismyhustle,ukpolitics,1390566610.0,"&gt;That's democracy for you old chum.

No, it is not. And even if it were, we'd have to give newborn children the vote if we wanted democracy. 

&gt; If you're taking the Ezra Pound route and asking us to embrace fascism that's one alternative view

""If you don't want 16 year olds to vote, then you're a fascist!"" 

Tell me, do you think Adolf Hitler would have been thwarted at the ballot box had 16 year olds been allowed to vote? 

&gt;but to support the concept democratic rule only in as far as it can be rigged to be as undemocratic and elite as possible, which in my view is what we've ended up with, seems to be both dishonest and self-defeating.

Adding young, credulous minds especially susceptible to indoctrination and propaganda would not help our crooked and shady democracy.

I've been a cook at several restaurants and most people who be disgusted by some of the shit I've seen happen that break health codes. A good bit of advice if you can't handle even the slightest bit of dirt is to never eat out.
