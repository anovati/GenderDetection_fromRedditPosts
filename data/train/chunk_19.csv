Like, give me $10k, and I'll live on that, quite comfortably at that, and will find things to do with myself easily. Playing video games, meeting up with friends, taking trips to interesting sights and taking pictures of them(and editing them later on), trying out new recipes at home, smoke weed, drink alcohol, meet some more friends, go work out 5 days a week, start DIY woodwork projects at home, renovate your living space etc.

Why limit yourself when there's just sooo much to do?

I honestly think not working is more fun than working. I mean, I do work, I don't want to take hand-outs etc., but if there was something like an unconditional basic income, you can bet your ass I'd take off a year.

Then again, I'm only 21, never took a year off(like other people my age) or anything. Moved out at 18, instantly started studying, so that may explain my view on this matter."

ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1389550253.0,"&gt; But there's a gatekeeping kind of quality to your responses - insider/outsider, hipster, non-hipster. That's the part that I can't support. 

It's something that actually defines metal differently than other music, interestingly - I firmly hold that metal is a *canon*. Fans of metal bands like metal bands, and so bands metal fans like are metal. In no other way you could imagine would funeral doom and power metal be part of the same genre since they, musically, have nothing in common.

So things are, considered by the majority of the community, metal, or not metal. This list *changes over time.* I think that gets to the heart of your objection. There *is* gatekeeping in metal. Asking Alexandria is *not metal* despite their own objections. But Ghost, a band that sounds like Blue Oyster Kult with REM vocals, they are metal. They tour with really heavy and well-respected bands. Metal fans like them a great deal.

I am not the arbitrator of this list. I hate Pantera, I hate Ozzy, I hate Nile, but they're definitely metal bands. I like some metalcore bands, and I'm a big Lifelover fan, and they're either barely metal or generally reviled. My understanding of the list is limited, but it's pretty good - I listen to lots of music and talk to lots of people.

And the list evolves. More of glam has been integrated in public memory. Pantera was once only a band for a jocks and assholes, and now it's revered. Metalcore which was once the bane of everyones' existence is now mainstreaming in a significant way. I think Ameoseurs, Deafheaven, and shoegaze black in general will become a major and respected strain of black metal.

The issue with hipsters is they *are real.* There is, and always has been, the pretense in metal to do something different. That's where we come from. We're rock, but heavier. But when you're a metal hipster, you're someone who really wants something *different,* but not really different. Shoegaze black metal sounds much more like shoegaze rock, which was something hipsters (in the general sense) loved from the beginning, than it does like black metal. You won't catch metal hipsters discussing Lurker of Chalice, Axis of Perdition, or Ahab. They're listening to drone, they're listening to shoegaze, they're listening to folk metal - things which are *not aurally or technically challenging.* Those are styles which consider themselves very original and particular and inventive, but it's not challenging, and metal has always prided itself on being challenging. They are *regressive* in this way and not progressive. This is a problem for those of us who want truly original music.

And of course this isn't to say nonhipsters don't listen to that music - I do - and it isn't to say the hipsters won't get mainstreamed in time - such a thing happened in indie rock over the last few years. 

Kahn-Harris... He keeps talking about wanting new and inventive music. He talks about the problems with the orthodoxy of genres, which is a big deal to me. He talks about low-effort music. And then he posts lists like this. Not full of inventive music. Not even metal music. The truth is he doesn't know a goddamn thing about metal. He likes to think he does. He is the textbook definition of metal hipster.

I'm not saying Kahn-Harris should be excluded from the genre. I'm not even saying he's wrong. But he's out of touch. He's *not part of the conversation* because he's so out of touch. His lists will be ignored by the community at large and lauded by other hipsters, other people that think the genre needs change and that change is mainstreaming simplistic and artsy music. He isn't talking about Demonocracy and the hype around BDM's Ritual and Everblack and Carnifex's new album being lauded by Glen Benton. That's a big deal. That's a new orthodoxy of death metal which will define that old and storied genre. It will create some very interesting opportunities, such as are represented by Born of Osiris with its prog styles, or Norma Jean and Pig Destroyer which have always been more punk than metal but are the flagbearers of the new union between metal and punk.

My continued critique of Kahn-Harris is for two reasons - the first to represent what the mainstream thinks and expose K-H as a fringe idiot, and second to crystalize my own thoughts for my own purposes. But let me be clear that what I write isn't some elitist nonsense, it is a true critique - and the message is and will always be that he doesn't really know what he's talking about, that he is *refusing* to take part in the conversation, and that he is really not contributing anything, except ego-stroking for metal hipsters."

It can switch lanes to kill one derelict, a mass murderer of sorts. You have the lever and can choose which lane it goes into.

You pop up and say ""Well, if I were the conductor I could easily disable the engine and manually override the brakes and avoid all damage!""

Different answer because the question changed. These kinds of clauses are to be implicitly assumed.

4. Let that cook uncovered until you can stir and the potatoes start to mush.

5. *Ninja edit* I added in leftover lentils that had a spice to them. 

5. Lower the heat and add cream/milk/sour cream depending on what you have. I used sour cream but you have to stir it a lot or it gets clumpy, but it's kind of a weird family thing to use sour cream.

6. Add any additional spices to taste. I usually add some salt (depending on my broth), pepper, and occasionally a dash of hot sauce.

dreamingofjellyfish,TwoXChromosomes,1389551108.0,"&gt;NJ - no time limit for abortion

Not quite. Nationally there's a limit on abortion that starts at viability. The issue is that viability is not easy or concrete to determine, and at 24 weeks survival is technically possible, but the odds are low.

Anyway, this is the rare case. Most very late abortions are because of a major complication with the woman or fetus. In general, in the US I want to see better access to abortion and better information. The vast majority of abortions take place before 16 weeks. And in those that are later, patients report wanting an earlier abortion but encountering obstacles.

Basically, I think the argument about viability is morally interesting. But from a practical standpoint, in the context of how abortion actually works in the US it's low on my list of concerns.

Meanwhile, he hasn't written an article about the Pats since at least 2012 (and I think the last one was 2010-2011, but wasn't willing to go that far back to confirm). He doesnt write any more about the Pats than he does about a half-dozen other NFL teams. And when he does, he does so poorly. This is the guy who wrote that losing Wilfork hurt because the Pats use small, undersized linebackers, despite the fact that our three starting LBs averaged 260 pounds. 

Not saying that to rip on Simmons, because It's pretty common in his age group. His dad didn't grow up with the Patriots, so there was no real tradition there. My grandfather's peers were as likely to be Giants fans as Pats fans. My dad was a packers fan, because the Pats didnt exist when he was born. Half of the new englanders that I know born in the 70s are steelers fans.

It's not a bandwagon thing. These same folks would root passionately for the Celtics, Bruins or Sox even if they lost for the next century. The Pats just haven't been around long enough to have ""three generations of fans"" games like when my dad, grandfather and I used to all go see Sox or Celtics games together. I expect that will chance over the next 15-20 years, though. The Pats are by far my number #1 team because football is by far my #1 sport and they're my football team, and that's a common sentiment among my peers. Also doesn't hurt that they've been consistently good for 20 years running."

But if you aren't lucky enough to ""pass"" quickly and/or are too ""visibly trans"", you can still face an enormous amount of trouble from family and society as a result, which often leads to suicide.

Goosemaniac,AskMen,1389551783.0,"I can tell you about my experiences dating, but all they will ever be is anecdotal. 

My dating life has encompassed a broad spectrum of different races, classes, and backgrounds. The black women I have dated have definitely not been homogeneous in their attitudes, opinions, and general behavior; however, the stereotypes definitely resonate more with some individuals I know. My SO is white, but I would not say that there is anything inherent about her, or Hispanic females that I have dated which make them inherently more desirable. 

You should remember, that you are only 18 and I am assuming that you are still in high school. The majority of people in high school are figuring themselves out as individuals and many cling to the pre-conceived racial stereotypes that are reinforced by their parents and social groups. Once you, and others enter into college or the workplace, this changes substantially. This is not to say that racial favoritism or prejudice ceases to exist, but that it becomes less prevalent as you and others find their own social circles."

Men are unable to figure out the point of compliments most of the time. Women grow up with really really low self esteem and are unable to confide in men. Women are pretty much are only there for sex and food. If she can't cook thats a big problem.

Men also suffer from low self esteem, but it really depends on who you talk to, a good majority of men who studied abroad are the ones with lower self esteem but it still not as bad as women have it in the ME.

I currently live in saudi and am born a saudi, if the women cant cook they just hire maids to do it for them.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1389551809.0,"&gt;I am still surprised that this straight, sleek hair is constantly being talked about and spread about by media and people. To me, it is unoriginal, boring, and overplayed.

For years I wished for hair like that, because then I could get one of those choppy layered edgy haircuts that seem to work best with straight hair. Isn't it funny that we always wish for what we don't have?

&gt;The worst is that there are some people who straighten their hair and it really doesn't look good on them because of the type of hair they have and their overall look, but they still spend the time to straighten and whatever else it is they do.

Yep! I've found that my hair will look great straight with one haircut, and ridiculously bad with another.

&gt;I also think that meme that says something about how when a guy tells you he wishes you didn't put on makeup that he really means you wish you could hide your makeup tendencies more than you actually do hurts all of this. Because it helps to keep women doing what they are doing to make themselves ""attractive"". I get that often times there is a lot more going on than we guys realize, but the few times I have said something about wishing she wouldn't wear as much makeup, I wasn't lying. The guys that say this tend to really mean it, and maybe you are wearing makeup when he thinks you aren't so maybe educated him on it. 

Ha ha, well, like you said, I think this usually stems from guys not having a clue about makeup. So many guys go on and on about the ""natural"" look, and how women look better without makeup. What they don't realize is that what they *think* is a ""natural"" or bare face is often loaded with makeup. You would be amazed at the amount of effort that a lot of ladies put into looking like they aren't wearing makeup at all. 

The thing is, though, a lot of woman who wear makeup aren't doing it to make themselves attractive to men. Sure, some do. Some wear it because they feel ugly if they don't. But for many of us, we wear it because we love it. It's fun. We love playing with colours, playing up our eyes or our lips, painting it on. It's fun! A lot of people have a hard time believing that a woman could wear makeup for herself and not for men, but honestly that's a huge motivator for many of us.

&gt;But when he says something about wishing you wouldn't wear makeup or that you would wear less, then he is noticing that there is more than there usually is. Maybe listen.

I think it's nice to take your partner's tastes into consideration, but at the same time I'm not totally down with the idea that it's a woman's job to look the way guys, or her partner, want her to look. Ultimately, her face and the makeup she uses on it is up to her."

IBiteYou,conservatives,1389551818.0,"&gt;but the issue there is ultimately poverty

No.  It's not.  Remember Sweden is a *socialist paradise*!

I lived in Europe for awhile.  Packs of roving Muslim youths harassing and attacking was a very real thing even in the 80's and it's only gotten worse since then.  There were occasions when my friends and I would be followed and we'd have to go into someplace very public to ditch these young men.  On one occasion, we were in a very crowded place on a holiday and a pack of these idiots managed to grab the teenage sister of a friend away from us and feel her up all over until some of our guys dove into the group and got her out.

This may remind you of events in Tahrir Square.

EVERY leader of the major European nations has recently said that multiculturalism is failing.  What they mean is that the Muslims are not assimilating into and respecting the culture.

&gt;The claim that there are ""a few"" who ""dare"" to speak again Sharia/Islam is laughable.

Islamophobic is actually an accepted term here.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389552213.0,"I don't think nursing clothing is really necessary unless you plan to nurse in places that aren't very private.  So even if you buy some, you don't need to buy a lot, no where near as much maternity clothing as you need.  I like nursing tops because it lets me keep my tummy covered.  Maternity stores or sections will typically have a nursing section as well, you may just need to ask for help finding it.  I would be willing to bet that almost all department stores will have some.

The other option is just to get clothing that can be pulled aside easily.  I preferred lower cut tops that could be pulled down rather than up.  Also tops you can unbutton work.  Outside of my home I would use a receiving blanket or a sarong (omg so comfortable when it's hot!) as a cover and that hid my boob anyway, but not necessarily my tummy or back if my shirt was pulled up unless I really stressed about it.  

Nursing bras are nice for being discrete and comfortable.  Same deal, find them at maternity or department stores.  I loved a [basic criss-cross style](http://www.sears.ca/product/warners-criss-cross-wrap-nursing-bra/618-000287722-7480) for night time and lived in my nursing sports bra most of the rest of the time.  I also had a couple of underwire nursing bras to keep the girls a little farther north but that is realy a matter of comfort and preference.  I found that they all wore quite quickly because I wore them so much and they get pulled and stretched around a lot, so I wouldn't spend a lot on them.  Just watch for sales.  

Even Walmart has stuff, it's just trickier to find so don't be afraid to ask!"

And yes, over the next decade or so you will see millions rising out of poverty and getting educations, especially since education programs are one of his top priorities. This will lead to greater demand for birth control.

&gt;why won't they just use condoms like everyone else?

And this displays your ignorance of the situation. Why do you think birth control was such a huge deal when it was introduced back in the 60's? They had condoms after all.  It provides people with the ability to privately control what happens with their bodies when there are others who would stop them. This is why abortion also became legalized soon after, private control of your body when someone else is determining your life. 

Perhaps you should read some history on birth control and family planning.  I would recommend reading about Margaret Sanger, but I'm sure you'd be unable to figure out a reliable source and fall back on the quote mining of idiots that twist her words and meanings.

He gained 14 pounds in 3 months. So that is more than decent, it is fuckin great even, unless he had a different goal. If he looked around a little before posting, he wouldn't have had the need to post. Especially since he doesn't give any details. What are we supposed to comment on?

Your hair changes during pregnancy.  Not always, some women it isn't a big deal, others will end up with a new baby and totally new hair color and texture.  

Sometimes your hair doesn't react as expected to the treatment.  The fumes aren't especially good for you.  I would talk to your stylist for ideas.  You could also experiment with non-permanent color or an unusual cut.  

Personally I hacked all of mine off almost as soon as I found out.  It's very convenient that no one needs to hold my hair when I'm sick.  I don't love the way it looks though, it's a work in progress, and it grows super fast while I'm pregnant so it's easier to recover!

duckduck_goose,OkCupid,1389553084.0,"I'm officially seeing someone.

It started out with a message sent August 4th. He said that he saw me at a bunch of local shows and I had remembered standing next to him at a show a month ago. By show I mean bands playing in tiny basements. I figured we would cross paths at a venue so I kept trying to let the universe bring us together. The universe failed me. 

I disabled my profile in fall and quit this sub. I felt okay not dating. Then toward the end of the year I reactivated my account. His messages were still at the top of my inbox. I skimmed through them and then I (a girl) sent him (a boy) a message asking weakly if he would like to ""finally hang out"" at a show toward the end of the month. He replied later that day. I sent an insanely (for me) flirty reply. It was Friday. He floated me a text. I remember feeling giggly and full of butterflies getting his texts because they were so direct and blunt. We made a date to get drinks after work.

I went home. Shoved everything into a drawer or under my bed. Decided my apartment being still somewhat messy would be good luck. Threw my hair into a ponytail and said a small ""don't let this be weird"" prayer. He met me outside my apartment and I sprinted down the stairs. He was standing in front of my building. Completely adorable. Curly hair, thick glasses, jeans, a striped shirt and a cardigan. He looked like he just came from a Weezer concert. Perfect. 

We walked to the bar and it was so crowded, noisy and full. I did not want to share a table. We left. I walked him up toward another bar. He started to tell me something but the words were barely coming out. It was like each word was wrong or painful and hard to articulate. I was really quiet while he kept tripping over language. Finally we both fall silent. I say then, ""oh hey, let's take a moment to observe our first awkward silence."" He got even more flustered. I said it was okay and that I found it adorable.

I learned he dated a female friend of mine in college on the walk there and I believe my reaction was SHUT THE FUCK UP! Some of you have received welcome to OKC messages from her. It was like insta vetting for me. At some point I learned he lived for a time in 3 of my favorite cities where I've also lived which was so odd. Maybe the universe was trying to bring us together after all. Here we are on this cold night walking to the space room for a drink in early 2014. 

He bought me a round. A few. My knee touched his at the bar. I was showing him photos on my phone. I decided we were going to leave. Coats on, comments on the cold weather, we get near my building and round the corner...

I leaned in to him to say, ""hey so I'm going to kidnap you now. C'mon!"" 

I unlocked the door and took his hand and never has the walk upstairs seemed so magical. He hung up his coat and walked into my still messy living room. I was putting mine on the hook and when I turned around he was standing there looking at me. I walked over to him fairly slowly and put my arms around him. I stood there for a minute and said ""well""... And neither of us could decide who kissed whom first. We just both kissed each other in a way that I haven't experienced in years. Knowing that yes! this is it. That spark or chemistry or infatuation was aflame. 

We ended up in my bedroom making out. I kept thinking, in the quiet pre-dawn moments, he was asleep. We just lay there cuddling and I kept kind of tracing curl patterns in his hair with my fingers. Out of the silence he would start talking again. At some point we both decided we didn't want the evening to end. We had planned to see each other Saturday anyways and Friday was supposed to be a quick drink. I grabbed some things and we drove over to his place.

Then, outside of brunch at Vita, we pretty much lay snuggling and sleeping in bed. We went to see a band Saturday night and we decided we still didn't want the date to end. So I saw myself there Sunday. And again Tuesday after work. And he secured our Saturday date this week early on and last night saw us making more plans.

I told him that I was only seeing him and he said the same. Yeah it's early but I have been looking for this same kind of guy for 4 years. I have been seeking a particular kind of guy I didn't even think existed and there he was this past summer standing next to me at a basement show.

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1389553112.0,"Stick figures murdering each other in droves... where have I seen that on the internet before? I love your concept though, quite excellent.

I'm just barely starting to build a new world to take my mind off my WIP a little bit, and it's a world where magic is a disease. People who contract the disease either become mages, which are disease carriers for the rest of their lives, or become empaths, who survive it and are immune the rest of their lives. Mortality is extremely high, and the disease comes in seasons, during which the mages are usually quarantined. Some of the city states of this world have begun reducing mage populations and seeking a cure, but in most their power is quite valuable and so their rights are merely reduced.

The power of the magic is to interact and compel ghosts. Ghosts have varying levels of personality, emotion, and will - the strongest are nearly, or more than, their mortal selves and tend to rule over this realm of ghosts and act as brokers with mages, while the weakest are nothing more than pawns which fade away the more they act on the mortal world.

These ghosts are not just anyone's ghosts though - they are those who fell to the plague. As medicine and quarantine advances the magic becomes weaker; as the plague spreads the available magic increases temporarily but dwindles after, as population growth drops.

Traditions of death very widely, but in plague seasons, bodies are destroyed as quickly as possible, whole neighborhoods are isolated by military force. But rarely are sufferers executed - empaths are extremely powerful because while they can see the ghosts they cannot interact, or be interacted with. They are nulls. The growth of mage ghettos is also advantageous - regulated trade for magic is a huge industry. Whole families suffer; madness, hematodrosis and hemorhage, swelling, cysts, bone growths, blindness, necrotizing fascitis... ten days to two weeks of worsening symptoms unto death. One in a million survives, usually crippled, to be paid extraordinary sums by governments (or occasionally by religious organizations) to act as nulls. Projections suggest a third, sometimes more, sometimes much less, survive, gain the orange glowing eyes of the mage - arrested and removed to ghettos managed by special military police.

Traditions around death are disturbed in many places. Where once was a vibrant tradition of necropolis', mausoleums, or cemeteries, fears over the last century have led to fewer burials. Some traditions have been revived thanks to new research into the plague, proving only a corpse of the plague-dead or a mage can transmit the disease, but much of funereal culture has simply died out. Colorless religious ceremonies over ashes are common worldwide. Mages have their own traditions - old rights against the undead revived in superstition - but their own dead are not buried, nor are their ashes returned. Instead they are cremated, limed, and mixed with concrete, and removed to other locations.

Some churches still hold there is an afterlife, a heaven, sometimes a hell. And for this reason the unquiet dead are abhorrent to them. Most oppose the continuation of mages and not the eradication of the disease. Religious enclaves have popped up who stolidly defend themselves from incursion of the disease. New cults have popped up around the disease, worshiping different powerful phantoms, exposing themselves to it ritually for different purposes.

Death becomes an obsession both inside and outside the ghettos. Half the year is quarantine season. Sometimes the mages riot - sometimes the fences and walls are breached, and disease runs rampant. The power that the healthy pay for is trying its damndest to swallow them whole."

snorting_dandelions,berlin,1389554543.0,"Berlin is one of the cheapest major cities in Germany. Friends of mine can live quite comfortably with 600€ Bafög and 180€ Kindergeld. They have enough money to go out partying twice a week, each of them has a room with at least &gt;16m², they can take the train home a few times a year *and* they still have enough money left to save something each month. Now this obviously depends on where you're living exactly in Berlin, my friends live in Pankow, so it's not *that* central anymore, but cheap.

Most jobs in Berlin you'll encounter will pay you 400-450€ a month, hourly wage will fluctuate somewhere between 5-8€ for a normal student job(waiting tables, serving drinks in bars etc.). So you gotta factor in working 60-80hours a month in addition to studying, unless you somehow get a scholarship or something(or maybe there's some kind of sponsorship from your government?).

You won't have that many language issues in Berlin. There are lots of foreigners, people are used to it. A lot of young people(&lt;30) speak English on a level where they're able to answer basic questions, especially if you know a bit of German. College students are usually pretty fluent in my experience, so you won't have any problem there. Most people in Berlin are quite considerate of foreigners.

Most courses will be entirely in German, yes. This depends on what exactly you're studying of course, but the majority of courses will held be entirely in German, although they oftentimes use English literature.

I'd recommend you to take a trip to Berlin for a week or two sometime in June/July/August, either couchsurf or look for a cheap hostel, and schedule as many flat viewings as possible in that time-frame. Finding a room can be a real bitch, seriously. You can look for flats via wg-gesucht.de or immonet.de/immobilienscout24.de and just call them up, or better yet, write them(seeing as your German is probably not the best). Just straight up tell them what you're planning on doing and that you plan visiting Berlin in the timeframe xx to yy, so you can set up something in advance and they don't fear you being a scammer. You could probably also try contacting the university in Berlin you're willing to study at and ask them if they could help you with that(a lot of universities usually offer a service like that).

As I'm not currently living in Berlin myself, I can't really tell you anything about the jobmarket. I'd guess the best chances to score a good job somewhere is before the majority of new students move to Berlin, so maybe August/September? If you're desperate, you could probably always just ask at McDonalds, but then again you're trading your soul with the devil in that case.

Personally, I'd say, get a job while you're still in school, start saving up money, and do it."

communistslutblossom,femalefashionadvice,1389554589.0,"No problem! I hope you can visualize these alright, I learned this stuff in dance classes so I had the benefit of demonstrations and a teacher to help me learn it. 

1. Lay on your back on the ground with your knees bent so that your feet are flat on the floor. You want your knees facing straight toward the ceiling, and both your feet and your knees should be aligned with your hips. Most people when they lay like have space between their lower back and the floor. You want to think about using your abdominal muscles to push into the floor, eliminating that space. This should also make your hips tilt forward a bit. This will help you learn the feeling of having your spine and hips more aligned and straighter -- in reality, no one's back is that straight when they are resting, but repeating this  exercise engages the muscles you need for proper alignment and helps you feel what position you need to be working toward.

2. When standing, try to keep your weight over your toes or evenly distributed rather than letting it all sink back into your heels. With all your wieght in your heels, it's easier to let your lower back arch. Try to achieve the same alignment that you did on the floor, but standing. This will involve your abs, the muscles right where the top of your thigh meets your butt, and your hip flexors (the muscles that stretch over the front of your hips. To get your hips straight instead of tilted back, think of pulling your abs in towards your spine as well as lifting up toward your ribs, pulling down with your butt muscles, and lengthening upwards with your hip flexors.

3. Make sure you don't go overboard in the other direction! If your hips are tucked really forward and under, it creates a kind of slouchy posture. Think of having a bowl of water in your hips, if you tilt them too far forward or back, the water will spill, and you want to keep it all in your bowl.

These are really basic things to try that are mostly to help you feel which muscles you need to be using and help you see and feel what a straighter back feels like. [This link](http://www.epainassist.com/manual-therapy/physical-therapy/lumbar-lordosis-or-lumbar-swayback-5-simple-corrective-exercises-tips-for-prevention) also has good exercises to help.

LolaRuns,gamingsuggestions,1389555105.0,"I got Drakensang during one of those game bundles and I was surprised how much it reminded me of a poor man's Dragon Age (note: it came out earlier). You can't have any romances, but structurally it is very similar. Similar perspecte and pause+plan gameplay style, you have companions, you can pick them up in your house (like in Dragon Age 2) and ask them a bit about their past (again this whole provess is A LOT less deep than in DAO), they have some character specific interjects, you have various ""hubs"" that you travel to via a map. It's a way to pass the time, I would just advise you to not pay too much for it. Core story is that your mentor was killed and you are traveling to where he lived to investigate and stumbled across some evil cult. 

[Chains of Satinav](http://store.steampowered.com/app/203830/?snr=1_7_15__13) is a point and click adventure set in a typical fantasy world (aka not humorous like Simon the Sorcerer). I also was in the recent deadalic bundle. It's also 3 bucks for one more day on the [gog weekend sale](http://www.gog.com/promo/telltaledaedalic_weekend_promo_10012014). It's a very straight forward fantasy story with some romantic untertones, your kingdom is under siege from giant crows, you meet a young fairy girl and then have to travel the world in an attempt to protect her because she's supposed to be killed to banish the necromancer who is responsible for all the bad stuff that is happening. There's a handful of times where you can decide how to interact with the girl you are protecting and traveling with (aka whether to lie to her to protect her from the truth etc). =&gt; the game is originally german, so expect the story/interaction to be more on the wistful side. 

If you don't need everything to be voiced/want storybased or something focusing on character interactions you could also look into visual novels (To The Moon which is in the current humble bundle is supposed to be a real tearjerker). "

We stopped on the road at the home of a family member of the professor who was in charge of the trip.  Next door, a doctor and a mechanic lived together. (they didn't make enough to live alone)  And they treated each other as complete equals.  We chatted a bit about the area, and as we talked the conversation veered towards US-Cuban relations, as we were Americans.  They weren't happy with the US, and they strongly believed that trade should be allowed.  They had a lot of questions as well about the US, and our government.  At the end of the conversation, this is what I took away-

-Most Cubans see the US as corrupt and capitalistic
-Most Cubans see the Cuban government as oppressive and ideologically closed.  (You should see the state propaganda, it is *everywhere*)
-Most Cubans would in a heartbeat move to the US, as the quality of living here is much, much higher.  They say Cuba is improving, but its not really changing.  

All in all, there are some pretty amazing things the Cuban government has pulled off.  This article mentions some of them. None of this changes the fact that they are a totalitarian state ruled by a small group of elites.  The government there is still dangerous to any dissidents, which makes this article hilariously ironic.

snorting_dandelions,AdviceAnimals,1389555581.0,"I'm currently living in Germany. I earn somewhere between 400€ and 450€ a month at my current job and get an additional 180€ a month from the state, ""Kindergeld""(essentially every child born in Germany gets 180€ a month until they're either 26 or start working a full-time job - until the child is moves out/becomes 18, the Kindergeld is transferred to the parents so they can buy necessaties like diapers, food, clothes etc.).

This amounts to ~ 7250€ a year for me, so about $9900. I share a 660sqft flat with my SO in the center of a city with 250k people. I have a pretty decent computer, I bought my own DSLR 3 years ago, and while it's a bit outdated, it still works pretty well. You can travel all over Germany by train very easily. Going *anywhere* in Germany won't cost more than ~40€ on weekends(for up to 5 people) or ~46€ for one person(+6€ for every additional person, up to 5 people), as long as you're okay with taking slower trains. So basically, I can go all over Germany for ~8,50€ per trip on weekends, as long as I find 4 other people that come with me. There are services online that lets you offer free seats to passangers that want to go into the same direction, or you can search for open seats on other people's tickets.

You can't do the same expensive activity every day, but with what I earn right now, I could afford to travel around Germany once every other month. Besides, there are lots of local sights I can go to first, where I could go in the morning and come back in the evening(no hostel costs). Living in Germany is pretty cheap by comparison to the US.

I didn't plan on writing that wall of text, but I hope it answered your question regardless."

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1389555848.0,"I've heard the same thing. There's a shit ton of pressure where black women's hair is concerned - if you leave it natural it will be seen as unprofessional and can hinder you in your career advancement, depending on your place of employ and your career field; if you have it relaxed you take flak from others for not letting your hair be natural. It seems like no matter what they do, someone's going to be there to crap all over them for it. 

&gt;it seems like they have to put in a lot more effort than the average white woman.

Even without all the social pressure, this is most definitely the case. Curly hair tends to be harder to work with; it's dry, and because of that it can tangle and break easily. Plus, the curls are easy to mess up if you touch it wrong. This is true of Caucasian hair that's curly but I've heard that it is even more of a problem for black women because their hair's far more dry. "

Paying also gets you advanced playbooks, which could help you do better in gameplay, but don't have any advantages assigned to them. They just allow you to choose a much more complex play calling system.

You don't need it to win, but you could argue it allows finer grain customization that could, depending on the team be an advantage.

There are no power ups, or advantages to being a paying player. It just helps support the game.

If my game were built today, it'd be cheaper. It was initially built on ASP, so the windows hosting is far more expensive than normal. The other computers sit in my living room. Add all the costs together (not including my time which never gets included), and I'm just charging to host it.

I think it's fair, and the users think it's fair, but they are the ones paying it, so that's sort of an obvious statement. 

I don't have anyone complain about it to me, but do notice people will sometimes comment they don't play because there are pay options. I respect that totally, but I think it's a fun game totally free. 

I think often the perception is that paying players get benefits, more than the reality of them actually getting benefits.

The actual reason that prices are rising is that schools know students have a more or less limitless ability to pay because this system incentivizes lenders to give away huge sums to as many people as possible, regardless of credit-worthiness, by guaranteeing repayment. This makes the higher ed demand curve much more vertical than it would be otherwise. It's essentially the same mechanism that drove the housing bubble, though some of the specifics differ.

IBiteYou,politics,1389556631.0,"Ah.  A breath of fresh air and a relief from the hyperbole.  Gohmert is speaking of personal experience.  I wonder how many people here have had contact with poverty and the culture of poverty.  Yes.  There's a culture of poverty.  Ever seen the movie, ""Precious?""  The idea that some young women/girls have babies in order to get welfare (or, in Precious' case, her abusive mom kept her for her support payments) is a fact.  There are a number of stories in the media about this phenomenon.  You can Google and see story after story.  

http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/11/25/about-half-of-kids-with-single-moms-live-in-poverty/

45% of children with single moms live in poverty.  

We have some serious cultural issues.  I don't know how to solve them... but I wonder if it's healthy to give more and more money to single moms, the more babies they have.

You might say, ""Birth control!""  But it's already provided through Medicaid ... which a mother in poverty is likely to get.

A box of condoms is pretty cheap.

You might say, ""Education!""  Ok... I can get behind that.  The questions are just when and where.  I'd say, 6th grade and done by the school nurse. 

But Gohmert's thought about limiting the amount of benefits a woman can get ... in short saying, ""Go ahead and have that fourth kid ... but your welfare isn't going up..."" is worth considering.

By the time a woman has one kid ... she knows how it  happened.  That's no longer an excuse.  She has birth control available to her... so that isn't an excuse either.

Basically, you are saying, ""After a certain amount of ""whoopsies""...the state is no longer going to pay for your children.""

Now ... under no circumstances am I saying that every woman who has a child out of wedlock is looking for benefits.  Once, however, you are on welfare and you have given birth to a certain amount of babies...and the welfare keeps going up with each one...a normal person has to wonder what you're thinking."

Diagonaldog,politics,1389556805.0,"&gt;Okay so your plan wouldn't really save much money at all. 4th children are exceedingly rare even among ""welfare queens"" in America.

Well then perhaps it could start with the third child, then. My plan was to stop people who are those ""exceedingly rare"" cases who are actually ""gaming the system"". By your own estimation, this would likely affect very few legitimate cases.

&gt;So your plan is to force enough poverty on her that she's forced to resort to adoption as the only way out.

How did I force this poverty on her? She decided to have those children, even after admitting with the first one she was already in too much poverty to afford it. You keep ignoring that part. A responsible adult should know that if you are already to poor to afford the one child you have, maybe its time to STOP HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX. She put herself in that situation. All I'm saying is she should take some responsibility for that and see a sliding scale of consequences instead of the gov't stepping in and making such a ridiculous lifestyle affordable.

&gt;Correct. You're proposing that the mother be forced to give up the child through below-subsistence-level poverty rather than let the child starve. Maybe ""be malnourished for awhile until the child is taken away by child protective services"" would be more accurate.

As I've said before, she; without the gov't assistance already being received at the time of this child's conception; would already be in a below subsistence level of poverty. Thats why she receives welfare. That is not a situation in which one adds a further burden of another child. They cannot afford it. Why should they be able to just rely on the gov't to subsidize kids they knowingly can't afford? If they want more children, they'll have to earn more money to pay for them. I'm not suggesting removing or lowering the assistance they receive for the children they already have, but if they continue to ignore the huge variety of options available to prevent pregnancy, its their fault and we shouldn't have to pay for it.

&gt;And if she doesn't have enough to bear the burden, the child must be taken from her, as you've made clear. 

Not ""must be taken away"" how about ""shouldn't be conceived in the first place""? Its not that hard to get a condom. Its not that hard to get birth control. Its not that hard for a single mother of 2 to abstain from unprotected sex that produces more children without finding a way to afford that extra burden. If a teenager has a child and can't afford to raise it, noone shames her for giving it up for adoption, but you make that option given to a single mother of 2+ children who already admits not being able to afford them sound like some sinister thing to suggest. 

&gt;If you're not rich enough to have a child, the child should be taken from you. 

Thats not at all what I said. I said ""If you've already admitted to being too poor to afford the children you have, you shouldn't have more."" Why do you make that sound so terrible? If its 1 or 2 children that's acceptable. That happens. But after that point, you need to take responsibility for your life and your actions. You have 2 children that you can't support without government assistance. Maybe its time to find a better paying job before making another one. And as I've also said before ""taking them"" would not be mandated. Adoption is an option, as is BIRTH CONTROL, CONDOMS, or abortion. They would still receive the majority of additional assistance they would normally get, so it wouldn't necessarily be impossible to raise that child.

&gt;I assume this also includes people who used to be middle class but fall on hard times, due to bankruptcy, disability, health problems, layoffs. They should also lose their children, at least the children after the second.

Okay, now I understand it, you aren't even reading what I'm writing at all are you? What I've said FROM THE BEGGINNING is this would only be for those women who, with their first child needed welfare, then had a second and received welfare, and possibly a third, however thats very much negotiable. I'm not an expert on the subject, so I don't know what would be a better option. This middle class family you're referring to would receive no change in benefits they qualify for now. Please actually read what I write if you want to argue.

&gt;Welfare is not designed in America to live ""comfortably"". It's designed to prevent malnutrition, freezing to death, bare-footed poverty as we used to have during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. So you're proposing a reduction below that needed to survive.

Slightly below, yes. A slight reduction LIMITED to the increase given per child after the second or third child. At that point They need to have a touch of desparation and realize: ""Hey I'm a mother! I should probably bring in more money if I want to raise 2+ children on my own!"" They would obviously be given this information after their last normal benefit child is born and their benefits increase, so they understand that having more children will actually result in higher costs for them and to take that decision TO BRING ANOTHER HUMAN LIFE INTO THIS WORLD very seriously.

&gt;I'm not ""painting"", I'm asking questions, and asking about the implications of your proposal.

By making straw men out of my arguments and using ridiculous analogies and exaggerations. Surely.

&gt;Money is ""shoved"" in all directions in society, and the ""irresponsible"" receive more than their fair share already. Primarily, though, this money does not go to welfare queens or the poor, but to the rich. Witness the financial industry bailouts, the auto industry bailouts, and the ongoing waste in the defence industry compared to which welfare spent on 3rd and greater children is an extremely tiny drop in a very big sea.

And? So now you're just saying its not ""a big enough deal"" to matter? It all starts somewhere, and introducing this kind of responsibility requirement to gov't benefits, targeted slely at those abusing the system can snowball into more beneficial change. However, that has nothing to do with the topic we're actually discussing, you're just comparing the entirety of gov't abuse with one way it occurs, which would obviously make any individual issue seem insignificant.

&gt;Yes, it is. It prevents the malnutrition, starvation, and abject poverty we have known in our own past in America and which we still see ongoing in much of the world.
I'd rather America became more like Sweden, rather than more like India. Wouldn't you?

I'd rather see less poor kids everywhere. All I'm saying is if you can't afford the children you have, don't have more.

So this is directed by the same guy as *Revolutionary Girl Utena* (Kunihiko Ikuhara). Apparently, after he made Utena, he basically vanished off the radar, perhaps doing a single storyboard here or there but otherwise completely out of the scene. And then 12 years later, he bursts back onto the scene to direct this, Brains Base' 2011 show *Mawaru Penguindrum*. In doing this, Ikuhara, according to the Nihon Review, [""has made the most victorious of returns with an anime of ambition unmatched by anything I’ve seen in the last ten years.""](http://www.nihonreview.com/anime/mawaru-penguindrum/)

I have heard this show has more layers than an onion, and deeper than ~~your mom's vagina~~ the coffers of Warren Buffet. I have heard you require the eyesight of a falcon to catch all the little details going on here. I have heard that the show's themes have a richness rivaling that of the juiciest of Salisbury steaks (not that I'd know what a Salisbury steak tastes like, poor-ass motherfucker that I am.)

*But enough of what I've heard!* After six episode, what do I *think* of such a show purported to be a modern masterpiece? 

...Well, it's hard to tell. Clearly, there is a big discussion of [fate and destiny going on, from Himari breaking fate and destiny by being revived via the Penguin hat (and yet it was perhaps fate that it would happen?), to Ringo obessively following the ""fate"" written out in her older sister's diary (although perhaps it is she who is making fate rather than the other way around?)](/spoiler) Forbidden love is also at play, from [Kanba kissing Himari right after her first Survival Strategy, to Ringo's obsessive love for Tabuki-sensei.](/spoiler) Furthermore, lots of imagery going on - from the constant re-appearance of the penguin motif, the two girls displaying an episode-relevant message everyday on the train, to the constant reference to apples (perhaps a pseudo-Christian reference to [Himari's rebirth through the penguin hat](/spoiler)?) But there's so much going on that, honestly, I don't know if I'm watching it right, or if there's even a right way to watch it!

I feel like I need a readers guide play-by-play to understand everything - I mean, shit, I *still* can't tell if this is a drama or a comedy! Thanks to /u/Redcrimson for trying to help me earlier, but the episodes he linked to had 404'd all it's images.

Minifig81,AskReddit,1389557474.0,"In 9th grade, we were reading some classic like Great Expectations in English class. It was my turn to read. I got to the word ""Debris"", and pronounced it correctly (debree). My teacher said ""Stop.. how did you pronounce that word again?"" ""Debree"".. she said I was wrong.. she told me it was pronounced ""de-briss"". When I corrected her in front of the whole class, she sent me down to the principals' office with a note to suspend me for causing a commotion in class and being wrong. The principal was a good family friend (and I was a good kid), when he saw the note, he laughed at it and had me sort mail for the hour. Just before the class period ended, he walked to the class with me and came in and said ""The word is debree, Miss *Debriss* (not her last name) .. you might want to suspend yourself from this class for a while while you reeducate yourself.."" She looked mortified. We didn't see her for a week afterwards. To this day, whenever I run into her, she tells me kids from our graduating class (even kids who didn't even have her during that period!) call her Miss Debriss when they run into her."

Belgara,Team_Japanese,1389557732.0,"For me, it's pretty easy, as I'm a Japanese major.  If I don't stay motivated, I fail my classes. 

That being said, I think a big key to success is to know when to push yourself, and when to back off a little.  I know everyone here is bound and determined to push themselves as hard as they can - and I'm no different.  The trick is figuring out the ""as hard as you can"" limit without burning yourself out.

Don't set overly ambitious goals.  Stick with what you know you can do realistically, then push yourself a little further.  Set yourself up to *succeed*, not to fail.  Ambition is good; unreal goals are not.  You're setting yourself up for disappointment, and you'll damage your confidence.

Also remember: Japanese is HARD.  If you're a native english speaker, you're going after one of the most difficult languages for an english speaker to learn.  Be kind to yourself.  If you're struggling, don't beat yourself up.  Ask for help, give your brain a little bit of a break, etc.  Make sure you've got a good study spot where you're comfortable and can concentrate, wherever that may be.  And a few good study playlists never hurt anything!  I strongly recommend getting into Japanese music if you haven't already; it's REALLY exciting when you suddenly pick up new words or new grammar patterns in songs!

Good luck to everyone in week 3!"

I spent the rest of the night playing that game, ignoring the rest of the group (rude, I know).  I was hooked.

I *begged* my parents for a GameBoy Color of my own for Christmas that year.  I knew I was going to get one.  I woke up at about 2AM Christmas morning and snuck downstairs to play with it.  My parents had also gotten a bunch of used games for it, most of them not worth noting except for Tetris. I played the shit out of everything until the sun came up.  I got in huge trouble for opening everything early, and had it all taken away from me for some time.

By the time I got everything back, I had bought Pokemon Blue.  This was another big influence on my life.  I spent as much time as I could playing that game, and went through many AA batteries.  Young as I was, I had no idea how half of the game mechanics worked (types, stats, etc.), but I somehow managed to beat it (yay Venusaur!).

Since everyone is forced to sit out due to head injury, then nobody is pressured to do it.  How bad would you feel if you sat out for a concussion but some guy on the other team didn't?  With everyone being held to the same safety standard you're not pressured to make this reckless decision, and the game can be ensured to be fair.

I don't think it's a definite red, seen worse tackles than this not get a red. But if you watched the game you would've seen why he made this tackle, it was to bring him down to stop the counter-attack. There's no way he's meant to hurt him here, he just really needs to bring him down and I think it's just bad luck that Nasri got injured.

Now if you want to see a tackle where the player wanted to injure someone, I would recommend watching the Nigel De Jong tackle on Ben Arfa a couple season ago, which broke his leg in two places, wasn't even given as a foul and no remorse shown by De Jong at any point. (If I recall he refused to go and apologise for it).

Samsung and a few others are starting slowly to do just that, and put some sort of Java virtual machine on an operating system running on their TV, so the TV can run apps and so on.  But then you need to make sure you keep getting updates for that software, and developers need to make sure the software keeps running on whatever bizarre cheap hardware the TV vendor  installed. 

We're getting there, but then I haven't needed a TV to watch TV  signals in 15 years because I have this marvellous invention called a personal computer, with a TV tuner card (which, ironically is starting to not work because of  the shift to digital cable requiring an intermediate box to decrypt the signal, and that makes programming media centre to capture the stream a more difficult process).  So the market for TV apps, versus set top box computers versus consoles that  are really computers that have decent hardware for games versus some sort of dumb box that talks to your cable company means there's a lot of overlapping functionality and competition over  who exactly is going to run all this stuff in your living room.

Silly_little_pet,AskMen,1389559322.0,"&gt; If the majority were uncircumsized, there would be an equal amount of stigma about being circumsized.

I clicked this topic thinking ""What, does anyone seriously have an opinion about this?"", and literally *just* found out that this is apparently a thing in America. In Scandinavia (where circumcision is only really done if there's a medical reasons) no one really gives a flying fuck.

I can't give any qualified guesses as to why there's this difference, but there's really no cultural bias for or against this here. It's not a thing at all.

Perhaps it has something to do with religion? Like the abortion thing? I always get puzzled when Americans talk about abortion like it's a debate. Over here it's a not a topic at all. I've put that down to religion being a much bigger thing over there, but that's obviously just me guessing. I don't know enough about it to judge whether or not it could be a factor in the view on circumcision though."

""Clinics see a preponderance of boys with dyslexia,"" Denckla tells WebMD. ADHD also strikes more boys than girls. The symptoms displayed by girls and boys with ADHD differ, too. Girls with ADHD usually exhibit inattention, while affected boys are prone to lack of impulse control. But not all differences favor girls. 


&gt;Boys generally demonstrate superiority over female peers in areas of the brain involved in math and geometry. These areas of the brain mature about four years earlier in boys than in girls, according to a recent study that measured brain development in more than 500 children. Researchers concluded that when it comes to math, the brain of a 12-year-old girl resembles that of an 8-year-old boy

There is a protein called [thermogenin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenin) that makes your body convert food directly to heat, instead of to muscle work.  The article says it's activated by epinephrine (adrenaline), which is a hormone that can be controlled with practice.  (I gave it a try for a few minutes, and I was able to warm my hands a fair amount.)  In addition, epinephrine increases blood flow and dialates the arteries, which also facilitates heat generation and transfer.  So there's a biological mechanism for this.

I'm asking because when I was in my teens here in Sweden in the 90's the general opinion seemed to be that female masturbation was empowering and beautiful while male masturbation was something that was laughed at and considered slightly ""icky"". A girl masturbating was a sign of her being in touch with her sexuality, a boy masturbating meant he was too lame to get laid, that sort of stuff. And as a consequence it seemed like guys seemed to avoid talking about masturbation for fear of someone calling them out on the whole ""masturbation -&gt; no sex -&gt; loser"" thing (not that it's true, but that was how just about everyone, male and female, seemed to look at it).

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389559750.0,"Sig figs in chemistry particularly is a shortform way of trying to properly calculate error propagation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty)

It's been enough years since I had to take first or second year chem that I don't remember what they teach students exactly, but if you're not learning to properly calculate variances, well then that's coming in future.  The propagation of uncertainty, particularly if you want to know how to prove each of the steps is typically about a second year level  problem in maths or  physics, so depending on the way your courses are arranged you could see  it anywhere in first, second or third year, but by 4th year or grad school it should have been covered.  

The short description is that significant figures are the only ones you can be sure of.  When you take any measurement there is an inherent error in the measurement - e.g. if I am typing at 50 words per minute I mean  50+/- 0.5.  If I'm typing 50.0 words per minute I mean 50.0+/-0.05.  On a single measurement that seems straightforward enough.  

But now lets  say I'm doing something more complicated.  I've got a time series measure of something (e.g. my typing speed is now dependent on some external factor) and we want to take the integral of my typing speed over time, divide by the spacing of keys on  my keyboard and all to an  exponent of something.  Well the wiki page I linked can give you the way to calculate the variances at each step - but it's becomes a lot more  complicated math wise, and most of the time with course work you're handed a bunch of numbers you can assume to be pure, which, well, aren't.  (E.g. the acceleration due to gravity varies over the surface of the earth.. so if you assume for an experiment g= 9.8m/s^2 well... you'd be wrong, but as long as everyone is equally wrong you don't need to spend 6 hours trying to measure gravity in your particular location).

gazork_chumble_spuzz,Parenting,1389559879.0,"I haven't got the time to watch the whole video right now. However, we try to be open and honest with our kids regarding sex and sexuality. They're still fairly young; my older one is not yet ten and my younger one just turned 8. They know that sex makes babies, and they know the basic mechanics of that. They know the proper names for their body parts. I had an in-depth talk with my daughter about the menstrual cycle, so that was cool. They know that people can choose when to have babies or not, although they don't know how. They know that some people are gay, that they're born like that, and it's okay. They know that as they get older, their bodies and feelings will change. We always tell them that it's okay to wonder and be curious and feel that way - it's normal. 

So far, what we have done is answered their questions honestly and to the best of our ability, without judging or scolding or shaming them for asking (sometimes we ask what prompted the question, or where they heard this word or that idea, because we like to know what's up). We both try not to get all embarrassed when talking to our kids; when I do start blushing or stammering, I always take time to explain to my kids that it's okay, they didn't do something wrong by asking...I just get embarrassed easily because sex is personal and I'm not used to talking about it. And then we continue on. Our kids are totally comfortable asking us questions or blurting out thoughts (my son is all about the boobies these days...), and while it can occasionally be a bit awkward we're so glad they feel open enough to just say it.

As they get older, we will be going more in-depth about things like birth control and STDs, about all the changes that puberty brings, about relationships and choices and all kinds of things.

Also, I don't believe you realize how often incumbents get re-elected over and over again - and much more often than not, it's not because people think they are ""doing a good job"".

&gt;As for doubling up on subscriptions for the console gamers – what if they wish to just play The Elder Scrolls Online on their Xbox One but don’t have Live Gold? Bethesda Softworks marketing boss Peter Hines reveals that they’re trying to “push” Microsoft to alter their policy.

 &gt;   “… we have been in talks with Microsoft about that very thing, and seeing whether or not there’s any room to change their minds about that, for folks who are only paying The Elder Scrolls Online and don’t want to pay for an Xbox Live Gold subscription, just to pay the Elder Scrolls Online.

&gt;    “The answer right now is that’s the way it works, but it’s something that we’re aware of and we keep pushing on, to see if there’s something that can be done. We’ll let you know if there’s movement there.”

&gt;It’s that mentality that prevented Champions Online and Final Fantasy XIV from releasing on Xbox 360. As for the PlayStation 4, we already know that PS Plus is not required to play free-to-play games such as Warframe and War Thunder, so TESO would be exempt too, right? Not so. A Bethesda spokesperson tells USgamer that they’re facing a “similar situation” regarding double-subscriptions on PS4.

behindtimes,truegaming,1389560587.0,"I really think it comes down to what type of cheating you're doing.  What is a cheat?  It's pretty much anything that wasn't intended by the developer to give you an advantage.  But not all cheating has the same impact on the game.  I'm not going to go into what's fun, as when one person is cheating, another might find it immoral.

There are cheats like wallhacks and aimbots which give you a direct advantage over the player.  These typically come at the cost of griefing other players.

There are cheats which allow you to save time.  Bots, macros, etc.  They take a lot of grinding out of the game.  While you might not be competing against the player directly, you are gaining an indirect advantage over them.  Even in FPSs, you have those prestige unlock cheats.  This comes down to the definition of ""what is the game?"".  Some people think the journey to prestige 10 level XX is the game.  Others think the matches themselves are the game, and don't want to devote the 2000 hours to grinding just so they can use their weapon of choice.

There are other cheats which allow you to change the gameplay.  These include things such as flying mode, or big heads, etc.  E.G. Halo 3 skulls.  These sometimes can be completely harmless, and typically everyone in the game is affected by them.

Even direct cheats can be used for fun in the single player version.  What if you're just not good enough to beat a level?  What if you just don't like that level and want to skip it completely?"

http://www.obd-codes.com/p0606

&gt;**What does that mean?**

 This code is a fairly simple one. It basically means that the PCM/ECM (powertrain/engine control module) has detected an internal integrity fault in the PCM. When this code is activated it should store freeze-frame data that helps someone with an advanced code scanning tool to get information on exactly what was going on with the vehicle when the P0606 code was triggered. 

&gt; **Symptoms **Most likely the only symptom of a P0606 DTC code is the illumination of the ""Check Engine Light"" a.k.a. MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp). 

&gt;**Causes** In all likelyhood the PCM / ECM has failed. 

&gt;**Possible Solutions** As a vehicle owner there is little you can do to fix this code. The most common fix for a P0606 code is to replace the PCM, although in some cases re-flashing the PCM with updated software could possibly fix this. Be sure to check for TSB's on your vehicle (Technical Service Bulletins). In all likelyhood the fix is to replace the PCM. This is generally not a ""do-it-yourself"" task, although in some cases it may be. We strongly recommend you have a qualified repair shop / technician do the work, one that has the capability to reprogram the new PCM. Installing the new PCM may involve using special tools to program the vehicle's VIN (vehicle identification number) and/or anti-theft information (PATS, etc.).

http://www.obd-codes.com/p0138

&gt;**What does that mean?**

&gt; The Heated Oxygen Sensor (2) located rear of catalytic converter produces an output signal relative to oxygen storage capacity of catalytic converter. Ho2S 2 signal is less active than signal produced by front oxygen sensor. This code sets when HO2 Sensor voltage is greater than 999 mV for more than 2 minutes (time depends on model. Could be as high as 4 minutes) 

&gt;**Symptoms** There may be no noticeable symptoms except for MIL illumination. Possible high fuel pressure can over rich the system. 


&gt;**Causes** A code P0138 may mean that one or more of the following has happened: Faulty O2 sensor Short to battery voltage in O2 sensor signal circuit High fuel pressure (not as likely) 

&gt;**Possible Solutions** Here are some potential solutions: Replace O2 sensor Repair short to battery voltage in o2 sensor signal circuit

I'm not sure what the employment situation is like in your neck of the woods, or the kind of work that you want to do, but one thing I've learned while looking for jobs (and nowadays hiring people for jobs) is that a whole lot of things other than GPA matter to get hired.

I remember when I first started stronglifts the bar really hurt and tore some skin away from my back. Luckily, it gets better for two reasons - one, you just get tougher and more used to the weight, and two, as you keep lifting you'll build up the muscles back there so the bar isn't putting as much pressure on bone.

I've always like the non-grip, but it's up to preference. Personally, I find that gripping the bar makes it easier to cheat and push up with your shoulders. Though you still want to secure the bar from sliding down your back, going with non-grip might be helpful in making sure you're not doing a press."

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskWomen,1389561847.0,"I have been the same height since I was probably 13 or so. I filled out a bit through my teen years but by the time I was 19 I think I'd been the same build for a couple years. Like you, I am a 32A. Don't hate your boobs! There's nothing wrong with being that size. Small is beautiful too. There are pros to it: running is far less uncomfortable, you can wear snug or low-cut tops without being judged for it, and gravity will be a little less harsh. 

So yeah, I was all done growing by the time I was 19. I was 5'8"", 117 lbs, and wore a 36A (which was not the right size; I should've been in a 32A like I am now, thanks to /r/ABraThatFits). I was underweight but not as badly as I had been as a child and young teen. Then I got married and had three babies in five years. Talk about changes! I gained 40 lbs with baby #1 and lost all but the last 10, which I needed because I was underweight. Gained almost 40 lbs with baby #2 and again, lost all but the last 10. Gained 40 lbs with baby #3 and wound up weighing just shy of 180 by the time she was born. Weight loss took way longer that time. I stayed around 150 lbs for a few years and then it gradually tapered off.

I am 29 now. We're done having kids (voluntarily, anyways...if we have an unplanned one we'd keep it). My body has settled back down into a state that is similar to what it was like at 19. I weigh 15-20 lbs more now. My feet went up about 3/4 of a size. I have some stretch marks that have faded and a bit of stretched-out skin on my stomach. My legs have filled out nicely - they were very skinny but now they're curvy and I love them. My boobs went from an A to a B to a C, back to a B, and now that the weight has slowly dropped away they're A again. Oh well.  : )  I have a new appreciation for my body and what it can endure and heal. 

All this to say, my body never ""stayed that way"". It changed, and yours will too. You have to learn to embrace your body and accept change. The body you have now is not the body you will have at 27, or 37, or 67. Your body will change. It turns from a teenage body into an adult body but it doesn't stay the same forever. Life changes you. Embrace it! Your boobs may never be big but that's okay...small is beautiful. They're good enough just the way they are. *You* are good enough just the way you are! Don't hate yourself for things you can't change. Don't look at your body as flawed. It's not. We hear the message that any body part falling short of the ideal is a flaw but that's a lie."

redyellowand,PrettyLittleLiars,1389561852.0,"&gt;Peuchet told of a shoemaker, Pierre Picaud, living in Nîmes in 1807, who was engaged to marry a rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy for England. Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest, in the Fenestrelle Fort where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric. When the man died, he left his fortune to Picaud whom he had begun to treat as a son. Picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune. He stabbed the first with a dagger on which were printed the words, ""Number One"", and then he poisoned the second. The third man's son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution, finally stabbing the man himself. This third man, named Loupian, had married Picaud's fiancée while Picaud was under arrest.

TL;DR:  revenge.

You have a choice. You either let them treat you like property for the rest of your life, lie to you in order to manipulate you into obedience, and have no real relationship with them, or you choose to move out and live your own life and face their wrath. It's a crappy choice, and it sucks that they put you in this position. But they did, and you have a decision to make. 

Personally, I think that it's better to leave and risk cutting contact than to stay and be abused and controlled forever. Your family is incredibly dysfunctional. And when the day comes that you have a spouse and a family, they will be imposing all their dysfunction onto your spouse and kids. As you have ample knowledge, it's no way for a kid to grow up. 

You are an adult. You have every right to live your own life, make your own choices, and be independent. They have *no* right to keep controlling you like this.

Granted, I'm tall, but I have specific issues I can relate to people on this forum more than in /r/tall.

blaghart,halo,1389563457.0,"&gt;The Bubble Shield in Halo 3 generally was limited to 1 per side of the map and was a map pickup.

And as anyone who played halo 3 can tell you that didn't preclude one team from hording them, just like a power weapon, and that fact could define the flow of games

&gt;In Reach it was possible to have a whole team spawn with Armor lock due to the nature of how Armor Abilities were designed in Reach (loadouts)

Which, due to the nature of armor lock, would mean an entire team that could not support each other, lacked mobility, and could essentially turn into rocks for brief amounts of time.

&gt;Armor lock in Reach granted full invulnerbaility for ~3 seconds on if I remember correctly along with a short cooldown.

Actually it now decreases under fire, and from day one a single bullet could prevent health and shields from recharging while armor locked.  In addition to being totally immune to damage, the individual was totally immobile, meaning that without a team mate covering them an enemy could basically camp and wait for their power to run out before they killed them

&gt;Bubble Shield was placed for about ~20 seconds but was penatrable through a variety of means (vehicles, shield drain pickup, simply walking in)

Which meant that shotgun campers had an advantage, and vehicles could be easily avoided, all while remaining totally immune to external fire (unlike the drop shield which had health and thus could be popped with a single tank shot)

&gt;The Bubble Shield was a map pickup that on default matchmaking settings would spawn about every ~60 seconds depending on the map.

30 seconds on most maps actually, which meant (with two of them) teams could have a bubbleshield going constantly camping a shotgun or an objective.

&gt;Both armor abilities did let your shields recharge in a manner in which being in these armor abilities did not delay the shield recharge timers. So if you spent 2 seconds in Armor lock, that would be 2 seconds taken off your shield recharge delay.

Not true.  Any damage that was taken while in AL would reset the timer, which, coupled with the low time that AL could be active and the long recharge time (in addition to a minimum consumption level on usage) meant that AL was useless without backup outside of protecting yourself from a splatter or a rocket."

Conquerz,martialarts,1389564019.0,"Just FYI, in all the fights i've been in my life, 90% of them were multiple opponents. I've won them all, and i didn't need krav maga, because i used proper distance meassures, good footwork and quick knockouts or sweeps. It's just that in EVERY video, every class i've seen and every guy i've heard talk about krav, their multiple attacks/knife/gun scenarios, seem so unrealistic. If i want to defend against that kind of thing i'd just do boxing. And as soon as i see the guy try to reach for his waistline to get his gun/knife, i'd punch him as many times as i can in the throat until he dies.

Also, i've been to multiple krav classes, seen videos, etc. So i know how the multiple attackers drills go most of the times. Also the knife ones. The ""HEY IM HOLDING MY ARM IN THE KNIFE IN THE AIR AND IM GONNA STRIKE YOU IN A DOWNWARD FASHION SO YOU CAN BLOCK IT OH SO EFFECTIVELY"" kind of trill just pisses me off. That's never going to happen. And also, training for the stabbing one also pisses me off. Idk, it might be that every krav dojo in Argentina is retarded, and that everyone in youtube is retarded. It's just unrealistic. You dont know how a fight really is until you're in one. And you dont know how dangerous a knife/gun REALLY is until you're in front of one. I suggest you try and fight an armed thug and then do krav, and you'll be like ""holy shit the real deal is so different"""

If TR has 20% pop, VS 30% and NC 50%, then more people will want to play NC because they will most likely be the ones that are winning, and winning feels good.

&gt;Unpopulated factions already get a nice XP boost, yet no one still wants to play them because they get their ass handed to them. They lose, they are not fun to play on.

That may be, but that just sounds like general population imbalance, not 4th factioning. It's not something that can really be solved by stopping people switching characters or limiting them to one per server. The only solution is to make all factions equally appealing to play, something which SOE is trying very hard to do already with all their balancing acts."

TerminalStar,depression,1389564273.0,"I've said a lot here, so don't feel you have to read it all - just wanted to give you as good an overview of my experiences as I could. :)

The GP I originally (say, 4/5 years ago?) went to about my depression was awful. I was so upset I couldn't even talk to him, my best friend had to do it for me - but still, he basically just went ""well, it's normal for teenagers of your age to feel a bit down"" and I think gave my a prescription for citalopram, but that might not have been him, I can't remember. Soon after that, he retired and I got a new GP. She was pretty good, I basically just went and told her what was up (after a suicide attempt...) and she gave me a prescription. I never really liked the pills (yay headaches and no sleep) so I just stopped taking them.

As an aside, I was hospitalised for my suicide attempt, and the staff were nice for the most part, though they took several goes at getting blood out of me (a nurse and then a doctor had to go to both wrists and elbows) and the nurse who admitted me was horrible - when seeing the cuts all up my arms, she just goes ""And did you do that?!"" in a really accusatory, dismissive way. That wasn't nice.

When I went to university soon after all this, I eventually went to the campus doctors to get some pills and to provide evidence for mitigating circumstances for my summer exams. The GP I saw was so helpful: put me on fluoxetine, reminded me to come back and mentioned this service called IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Treatment, I think).

The idea is that the NHS know they're bad at mental health, and that it's difficult for people (especially those who get lost in the gap of 16 - ~20) to get to the mental health services they need. I was on the waiting list for this for about 6 months. This granted me 8 hourly sessions a week of non-intensive therapy with a really lovely therapist (seriously, she was so nice). However, at the end, it became apparent that my depression and anxiety hadn't really changed at all - I need more intensive therapy (i.e CBT). I've been on the waiting list for that for around 18 months now, and actually got a call about it the other day, so hopefully that's happening soon.

I think, although location certainly plays a factor, the quality of experience depends on who you're dealing with. For example, my first GP who was really bad, and then the second who put me on meds were such different experiences, both in my hometown. I know in the same area my best friend had a great experience with a counsellor, having been referred by her GP.

Basically, my attitude towards the long waiting list(s) has been that if I get in big trouble (say, another suicide attempt), there's always the emergency room, because even if you can't rely on the NHS for lower risk things (like waiting for therapy now), they are there in an emergency. I will say that depending on your age (you're sub-25, but still live with your parents, so I'd guess mid teens?), it can be difficult for them. At 17, I was told it's hard to know whether to classify me as in need of the children's services or adult services.

The final thing I want to say is that you might as well put yourself on a waiting list ASAP. If you find yourself getting better, they'll take you off at your request. If you find yourself getting worse, you can tell them and they can provide you with emergency help - I was given a number to call 24/7 if I felt like I was feeling suicidal or like I wanted to self-harm. Also, and this is tough for me personally thanks to my anxiety, you can say if you're unhappy with a certain staff member. If you have therapy through the NHS, you can ask for a different therapist if you don't like the one you have.

If you have any specific questions or want me to elaborate, feel free to ask and/or PM me!"

Renner1,worldpolitics,1389564291.0,"&gt; What is ""disgusting, unrealistic and unhelpful in full"" is your refusal to accept that both peoples should have the right of self-determination in their own states. 

You say this, but then--

&gt;&gt; But in fact, the things they call for (in particular a Palestinian right of return) do show what they are after--the end of Israel, within any set of borders, as a Jewish state. They might try to disguise it, but the inevitable result of what they call for make their aim plain.

You act as though the rightful return of Palestinian families to the land that they lived on 70 years ago and were forcibly expelled from or fled due to stories of Zionist atrocities like Deir Yassin is some awful, unjust, unreasonable demand, and that keeping a ""Jewish state"" is somehow more desirable then compensation and justice for expelled Palestinians.

You clearly don't agree that the Palestinians expelled from Palestine either in 1947-49, 1951-55, or 1967 have any right to return to Palestine, but you somehow support the ""right"" of Jews from anywhere with no connection to Palestine to come and live on the land there."

The door opens to an empty doorway. What is this all about? Should I go in? Is she in there? Whats going on? SOOOO Mysterious and exciting.

He cautiously steps into the room and the door shuts behind him. He peek in to the room to find it empty except for a lone mattress/platform in the center of the room with a chest resting at the foot of it. The lighting is dimmed yet warm and inviting.

He notices something, a note laying on the platform calling silently to him ""READ ME!"" and slowly steps over to it. The water in the bathroom, which is now behind him, turns on. He glaces over his shoulder in the direction of bathroom, and contemplates for a moment. He decides to read the note first and investigate later.

As he reads, a detailed list of all the raunchy sex acts your'e going to perform, he hears a plethora of exciting sounds slightly drowned out by the sound of running water. A zipper... laces being tightened... the clacking of heels on tile.

Just as he finishes the list the bathroom door slowly  and steadily swings open, no sound from its well maintained hinges.

superspeck,IWantToLearn,1389564494.0,"DIY home/auto work is based upon being able to understand a system. If you can understand a system (which is a group of parts working together to solve a problem), then you can spot what part isn't working and is bringing the system down. The number one attribute that I see in handy people is curiosity about how systems work and the ability to build and explain them with analogies.

To use your example, father would teach his son how to work on a diesel engine by understanding how injectors, compression, valves, pistons, and other parts work together to make force. A dad would teach his son that pictures should be centered on a wall and how to find studs by explaining the standard construction of a wall (studs every 16 inches on center in most cases) and then teaching tricks to find the studs themselves. Start with principles, then work down to specifics. 

Replicating that sort of mentor/mentee education can be difficult and will involve a lot of solo research and making a lot of mistakes, then extracting yourself from them. You can learn principles easily enough on wikipedia, but the tricks of the trade need to be researched in specific forums dedicated to each trade or art. I have to fall my father-in-law, who is a master plumber, more often than I'd like to admit. My dad and I regularly talk about the renovation work we've done or are doing. But they're both at least a hundred miles away, so it's not like they can show me, or stop by and do it for me. I've had to call electricians out the first time I did a specific task and have them explain how I should do other certain tasks. (I have yet to fail a building inspection, which is a pretty good record for a part-time noob.) 

If you're specifically talking about DIY home improvement, then you would be well-served to subscribe to Fine Homebuilding and Journal of Light Construction. These magazines have a lot of articles that teach you how to do specific things and why, mixed with practical tips and tricks of each trade. They have helped greatly as I've been renovating my house. But the only other way to do it is to make mistakes and to either extract yourself from them, hide them, or take it apart and do it again the right way. No matter how good the advice you're getting is, there's no substitute for actual experience. "

then, i developed hypothyroidism and gained ~150 lbs. so now i weigh around 270 lbs, and i believe that's brought me down to a 2 or 3. i still have clear skin and doll lips and all those other things, but i'm basically invisible because of my weight. other than from my husband and family, i haven't received a compliment on my physical appearance since i weighed about 180 lbs. actually, that's not true - a girl in my acapella group told me she liked my scarf a few months ago. but that's it. 

funnily enough, i'm more confident now than ever before. when i was thin and pretty, i had incredibly low self-esteem and simply couldn't see myself as others did. when i looked in the mirror, i thought i was legitimately obese. now that i actually am obese, i look back at old photos and just go ""oh, sweetie, no.""  everyone focused on my appearance 24/7 so i became hyper-aware of it and could only see my flaws. it was pretty sad, in retrospect. in some ways, i miss it, but in others, i'm glad i'm ""ugly"" now. i feel so much more free."

If you get a top loader (and not one of the rare top loaders with rca output) then you will have to connect via the RF input, which will require some additional hardware.  The classic grey RF boxes may not work with the tuners in modern TVs.

Also be aware that modern screens have more lag in them then old school CRTs did, so you will want to enable ""game"" mode on your TV if the TV has it.  This is not a big problem for most games, but can be a PITA for games like the quick draw minigame in Kirby."

You'll also want to research the electrical, plumbing, and energy efficiency codes. Your city will have adopted parts of specific editions of each, and your city building department can help you understand which parts you need to follow. 

The basic gist is that there are certain things that need to be in a house for safety. Sewage of some sort is one of these; not having it is a public health issue. Having hot water pipes exposed is a safety issue because hot water can burn people and the pipes themselves become wear items. Gypsum (drywall) isn't just a wall material that people like, it's also what keeps a wood framed house from burning down immediately. Insulation of some sort and windows that meet current code requirements for thermal transmission is required because otherwise it costs much more money to heat or cool a building. 

Putting mechanicals (plumbing, electricity, HVAC) in easily accessible conduit is not (much of) a problem, though. In fact, it makes sense to do that, and I've retrofitted some of these techniques into houses as I've worked on them.

Building codes are a fine balance. For every single thing that is required under building code, there's usually a good reason why, and someone has probably died or been seriously injured when that code wasn't followed. 

Take, for example, the new mandate about fire sprinklers. The reason for that is because of the increasing use of laminated adhesive composite materials like MDF, OSB, Plywood, and laminated structural members. Those materials bring the cost of a house down *dramatically*, because where else are you going to find a continuous piece of wood that can span a 40 ft. cathedral ceiling these days... but they also burn like torches because the glue is insanely flammable. The fire sprinklers are there to allow people to live in cheaper houses made from composite materials, but give them a fighting chance of escaping from a house that would otherwise go up in a single dramatic ""woomfh!"" like a piece of flash paper.

And in that context, a sensible explanation is essentially Revisionist Zionism.  A significant part of it is not letting people get away with wronging Israel or the Jews.  That was the explicit reason for the Qibya massacre, which Sharon was also involved with.  The thought process would essentially go ""they attacked us, so we shouldn't prevent them from being massacred"", or even ""they should be punished by the Phalangists"".  It's also important to note that having the degree of separation (no Israeli fingers on triggers) gives it a degree of distance, so that the massacre is ""making them pay"" in the minds of Israelis, not indiscriminately killing civilians."

Renner1,confession,1389565638.0,"&gt; What I've seen on there is the idea that women are immature, unintelligent, and not worthy of respect. 

Playing devil's advocate again and I admit I haven't gone extremely deeply into the posts there, but I don't see anything say ""women"" in general are 'immature, unintelligent, and unworthy of respect'.

There was a discussion about the idiotic Lena Dunham and her ridiculous producers of her show-- it's pretty clear Dunham is immature, unintelligent, and unworthy of respect, as are her producers.

Obviously Dunham doesn't set at all a precedent for women in general, although she obviously would like to.

&gt; Second wave feminists do not hate men or maleness

They sort of do, though. The 'biggest' names of second wave feminism contributed greatly to the stereotypical ""man-hating feminist"".

They think men are inherently oppressive and dangerous, and that everything associated with men or masculinity is dangerous and sexist and detrimental.

&gt; If you read any second wave feminist literature, the goal is to give women control over their own lives, and allow women to make decisions free of society's (which was patriarchal at the time) pressures. 

You'd think if that was the case they could've pushed for greater independence in the fields they wanted, while acknowledging that there wasn't a sinister male conspiracy to keep them down and that society wasn't inherently oppressive to women and that they weren't some sort of collective messiahs for the female gender.

Instead you got extreme patriarchy theory and endless barking about the evils of anything male and how awful male-influenced culture is.

Second wave is the wave that said heterosexual men are inherently violent and that sex with them is oppressive and quasi-rape, remember?

&gt; A patriarchal society is an unfair and oppressive society; it's a society where one group has a higher social standing than another group.

Not at all a sure thing. Certainly a lot of issues looking retroactively at history, but to claim that all civilizations and societies historically were based around keeping women down, or deliberately keeping women down, and on an exclusive basis, is completely inaccurate.

 &gt; And I believe that historically, men didn't respect women as equals, and attempted to use that to justify their behavior. 

This is pure feminist theory, right here. I agree that some men thought like this, much in the same way that every society will have it's racists or extreme ethnocentric attitudes, or people with bigoted ideas in general.

But to say that in general society was based around that idea, and was full of adherents to it? 

I disagree extremely, and it seems completely historically baseless."

If you by chance have a window facing the direction you need and that window isn't obstructed by buildings, trees, etc. you'll get a decent result. Generally speaking though, you're much better off with a higher mount that likely provides a cleaner line of sight with fewer things to interfere with reception.

2) I've just started looking for one myself. Yesterday I noticed this one on Slickdeals, but it's sold out. Even has PVR capability with an external USB hard drive. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16882576003

3) If you're cutting cable TV, you can make the network of cable outlets in the house all have access to one antenna by making that antenna the input to all of the outlets you want to use. This can be done in parallel to any cable input for say internet service with split inputs wherever everything branches off.

I'm working on a project where connect an unused outlet into an attic mounted antenna which I use as input for the main house splitter isolated from the cable internet. The internet then runs directly to a dedicated outlet where the modem and wifi reside.

4) I'm still a novice at antennas, so take that into account. I'd test with something inexpensive and easily returned if it performs badly first. Say a UHF set top antenna from radio shack placed at the highest line of sight point you can find. See what you get and how stable the reception is. After that consider returning the inexpensive test antenna and upgrading to something larger. Talk to your landlord and see what options you have beyond something small in your apt."

superspeck,RealEstate,1389566704.0,"Website designers and systems administrators (among other computer trades) aren't licensed *yet* -- remember, many of these fields were only created in the last two decades, and they haven't slowed down long enough for laws to catch up with them yet. If the fields are still around as engineering fields in another fifty years, I would expect to see licensing arise. (Source: 15 years in IT.) 

You're actually more likely to find contractors who don't pull or don't want to work under permits than those that follow every letter of the most recent code. The reasons that the permitting process and building inspection process exists is for safety. Since our government provides emergency services (e.g. fire departments), it's in the government's best interests that houses don't easily catch fire or injure their occupants. Dead people don't pay taxes, after all, and they only vote in Chicago and Texas. Governments also back (or outright own) the companies that deliver utilities like electrical power and water, and better energy codes make the demand for energy and water easier to predict. The government wants to make sure that if you modify a structure, you are doing it in a way that preserves the safety features and integrates the latest in energy savings. It's not cheap for you, individually, in many cases -- but it's much cheaper over the types of timespans the government is thinking of. That's the job of a good government. 

How is liability insurance a failure of a regulatory state? I'm failing to see that one. My liability insurance, as an IT contractor who works with systems that are many more times expensive than a house, is a few dollars a month for ten million dollars worth of coverage. I'm happy to have it. "

The upper pubic region went fine. I didn't have the balls (pun unintended) to go ATG, but WTG was no problem. I used slightly too much pressure and got very slight razorburn, but this was my own fault, seeing as the surface was pretty flat. Keep in mind that the skin here is extremely sensitive and the hairs quite thick, so get a proper prep going. Apart from that, easy as pie.

The scrotum, however, (told you it would get graphic) for some reason was the easiest part. Don't ask me why, maybe it's just cause I was extra careful.

The best I can make out I think you're having trouble understanding why this fee isn't part of the initial cost, the answer to that, can only be explained by comparisons.

Think of this like when you go to the store to pick up groceries, say you buy milk at the store, on the receipt you'll see 4 separate charges, but they'll all be for a single product. 1: the price of the product itself, milk. Over here somewhere in the ballpark of 5-6 dollars. 2. The recycling fee, an additional fee imposed for a recyclable product, that can be returned. 3. GST 4. Pssh this is Alberta who needs PST

So while they might all be for the same thing, its not the price of the product or service itself. It would be the additional fees and taxes imposed on the purchase."

Lluxx,actuallesbians,1389567003.0,"Before I knew I was gay, I suppose I was homophobic in that ignorant, thoughtless way a lot of people are before they're forced to consider these things. I remember being confused about the whole 'Why do lesbians go with girls who look like boys if they like women?' when I was a young teenager, but that was likely because I lived in a very straight-dominated town and thus had no exposure to things out of the norm except for stereotypical portrayals on TV. I think I used the word 'dyke' a lot, but I was an idiotic kid who swore as much as possible regardless.

I remember I rejected the idea of liking women for a while. As a young teenager, again, I was scared I'd be a lesbian so I used to picture myself kissing girls to reassure myself I didn't like it (funnily enough I wasn't the most self-aware child, it seems...). When I had accepted that I was bisexual, though, I quite liked it and learned to own the identity. When I knew other bisexuals it became much easier to actively like it rather than hate it. However, when I realised that I wasn't really interested in guys and treated sex with them as a chore I went through the same thing; really didn't want to be a lesbian (thought it'd leave me with an impossibly small dating pool, I think) but eventually I came to accept it and now I like it and would never wish it away. 

I never experienced a desire for 'hyperfeminisation', like what you discussed. I never liked dresses and pretty much always wore what I wanted, which is feminine but tomboyish and alternative mainly. I'm ridiculously vain, especially about my hair, but I think that's just how I am! Perhaps because I was never particularly butch (I'm very thin with, uh, large boobs, so I can't manage better than boyish if I'm wearing loose clothes) I never received negative comments about seeming masculine, so I never felt any need to change anything. For what it's worth, I was never religious (it's not particularly common in the UK) so I never struggled with that kind of homophobia. 

Sorry for the ramble! This was a very interesting thing to think about, though; thank you for asking about it. I also enjoyed reading your thoughts and the other poster's. It's really remarkable to think about how different we all are and what we've had to overcome. I was really very lucky in that I grew up without religion making me feel ashamed and also have generally been quite fortunate.  "

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389567069.0,"Neither of our families actively practice, but there was still a minor freakout at a family event once when I insisted that no, I am not Christian.

We have had fairly simple straightforward discussions with our parents and made clear that we are raising our children agnostic because we want them to have the freedom to choose for themselves once they are old enough to think critically.  As a result, we insist that no one try to teach the kids about religion without us present.  No one has tried very hard, but at least when it comes up we know what's been said so that we can talk it through with the kids.  Talking it through usually consists of asking questions about what they've been told.  No matter what it is, you get to a point where ""how do you know?"" or ""how do they know?"" can't be answered.

If, someday our kids decide that they don't ""know"" but they are going to choose to believe, we're cool with that.  But we won't let anyone else bully them into accepting something before they are ready to make that choice.

It can be uncomfortable at times, Christmas carol lyrics, saying grace at family gatherings, ""God's plan"" types of ""comforting"" require discussion with the kids, but you get used to it after a while.  

Some people disagree with what we're doing but by being firm and refusing to engage in philosophical debate we have weathered the storm fairly well.  We simply reiterate ""we are raising them agnostic, we want them to decide for themselves once they are older"" and if people get too pushy I tell them that I would rather not undermine them with my kids, but unless they want me teaching my kid that they (the authority figure) are a liar who can't be trusted, because that's what it sounds like to a kid when you have that conversation, they shouldn't try to contradict me on this point.

And there *are* incentives; they just don't work:

* Kindergeld: 184€/month until your child is **25** or has finished professional education. I'm a 24 year old working on a Master's degree and I still get that money; I'll actually get it until I'm 26 since I was conscript for a year.  
* Daycare often is heavily subsidized or even free. Since august of last year any child between 2 and 6 is entitled to a place in daycare and the parents can sue their city/county if it can't provide a place.  
* Elterngeld: If you care for your newborn at home you get 67% of your last income (at least 340€, at most 1800€) for 12 months or 14 months if the other partner does this for at least 2 months too. The people doing this also still are employed with their ""normal"" employer. They don't have to work for that time, though, and the employer doesn't have to pay wages.  
* Betreuungsgeld: If you're not employed and care for your child (older than 14 months and younger than 36 months) at home you get 150€/month, additionally to normal Kindergeld.

behindtimes,short,1389567513.0,"Depression is a tricky subject.  Obviously a person who is depressed needs help, but I can understand why a person might attribute height to depression.  They're not necessarily mutually exclusive.  I'll admit, I suffer from depression, but I cannot go to /r/depression.  It's not that I'll feel worse and want to try to stay happy if possible, but I'll become angrier when I see many of those posts.

The problem for me is that some people are depressed due to internal forces, others due to external.  What I mean is that some people have no friends, no family, are constantly bullied, poor, etc.  They're just in a bad situation, no fault of their own.  Other people post about how they're depressed, but their friends and family don't understand, that they have a good job and significant other, but are still depressed.  I could argue that being a short male would be like the first group, because there is a societal bias.  You remove the external factor (the societal bias), and the depression could potentially go away, whereas drugs and therapy can only mask the problem.  For the people who suffer from internal problems, that might be a better solution."

As a tall women I have a lot of empathy for short men since we face a lot of the same kinds of social issues in opposition to each other especially regarding dating. People don't ask me out on dates as often because I'm taller than them, I'm often physically larger than men I meet because of my height and people are put off by that. I don't fit societies expectations of what it means to 'feminine' and 'girly', even though I'm actually a pretty girly girl.

I think though, people come to /r/tall because it's a community of people who embrace their physical weirdness and love it and enjoy it, both the men and women (Ive always said I wish I were just *one* inch taller so I could join the 6 foot club) and we like the interaction with not just other talls and tallettes, but anyone who is body positive and can talk constructively about that in a safe place.

And now, every thread on r/Saints r/nfl has to have a Vikings fan that comes over to say something fucking mean, including tons of Katrina jokes included (being nastier than Falcon's fans!) does not bolster any sentiment to the Vikings reddit fanbase. Do you expect us to hand out pity points to you because we were trying to win a game?  Beyond my little rant here though, two of best friends are Vikings fans, and AP is a living legend and seems like a great guy. Just stick with your team and enjoy what will be a great new stadium."

I do have friends whose boobs grew in college if that makes you feel any better. 

I also have a couple friends with A cups and a friend with D cups, and I have to say that I think A cups are really much better. You can wear a lot more different tops without people thinking you look slutty/are inappropriately dressed, bras are much cheaper, no sagging, no back pain, etc. But if you do really want D cups, I can tell you that I have one friend who had A cups until her junior year of high school, and she has DDs now."

2) one of my biggest hobbies is fashion, and sadly, there aren't many affordable and fashionable choices for plus-size women that i've found, anyway. for example, it seriously took me MONTHS to find a coat that was both aesthetically appealing and cheap enough for me to afford, and i still don't really like the one i ended up with! whereas i used to be able to walk into a store - any store - and come out with something cute. i miss that a lot, too."

 - How much room do you have, are you in a small apartment, or a large home with space?  
 - (Honestly) how much time do you have to spend with the dog training?  

Shelters are well and all, but if you don't go in with a good game plan, you may very walk out with a cute 6 month old puppy that turns into a real handful depending on their needs (Pit Bull, Jack Russell, Australian Shepard.)  

The wife and I adopted a Golden-Doodle, she's had dogs but I hadn't and we read that it was an easy dog to train which was good for me.  While it's been easier than my neighbour who has a Vishla it's still a handful.

Philip Rösler (former minister of economy, former health minister) was decent as health minister, you didn't really notice him and him being an actual doctor of medicine had him seem somewhat competent.

superspeck,RealEstate,1389568798.0,"Since this is /r/RealEstate and not a subreddit that is focused on how houses are constructed, I'm going to address the legal issues first. 

The first and foremost legal issues, as some people identified in different ways, is that the structure you're describing wouldn't meet building codes in the US. If you don't like that, you're welcome to try building this structure elsewhere. I hear Mexico is nice this time of year. 

Those building codes are there for very good reasons. Usually, someone has died to call attention to an issue. For instance, bedrooms need to have a window that an adult can climb out of. Why? Because people were putting kids in indoor bedrooms with no windows, and when the house caught fire, they died. Fire sprinkler systems are something that many municipalities are starting to require. Why? Modern construction materials (OSB, ABS plastic, and anything made out of wood and glue laminate) catch fire and burn very quickly, and produce toxic smoke that can cause people to die. You have to meet certain ventilation requirements if you are burning anything in the house, whether it be wood or otherwise, and regardless, you need carbon monoxide detectors, because electric heaters can cause fires that don't show up at first any other way. Carbon Monoxide has caused countless people to die in their sleep. Complying with building code really isn't a matter of ""gosh darned gubmint,"" it's a matter of life or death for you and anyone who occupies that building for the rest of it's life. And governments have an interest in keeping you safe beyond the warm and fuzzies they feel for you as a citizen; see also the great fires in Chicago, San Fran, and elsewhere. That was expensive for the government to pick up from. Governments hate spending money on disasters.

There's lots of stuff that doesn't deal with safety, of course. A good example is energy efficiency. In the countries that have adopted the aspects of international building code that deals with energy efficiency, this is to keep the demand on (government-owned or backed) utilities relatively level. Electricity generation that can respond to peak demands is inefficient, so they want your house to help keep the heat in when it should be warm and the A/C in when it should be cold. 

Beyond that, people in the US have come to expect certain things when they buy a house. There's a legal term that I'm looking for that I can't quite remember, but you basically as the builder or renovator of a structure have a legal duty to make the structure perform in specific ways. People expect it to be insulated to a specific standard. People expect it not to make them sick. People expect it to keep water out. People expect the utilities to work. When you transfer the title to a structure to someone else, they simply expect all of these things without you having to state them. 

Obviously, not all countries have these requirements or expectations. One of my coworkers married a mexican woman. They, and their two toddler-age children, spent Christmas down south of the border with her family. The three year old got his head stuck, as someone else said, between bannisters on a railing. The water pressure supplied by the utility was low -- which wasn't a problem in normal use, because they have a cistern and Mama showers in the morning and Papa showers in the evening when he gets home from work. With others in the house, there was little to no running water most of the day. Obviously, you don't drink that water. The house is timber-framed adobe block with no window glazing (no glass, just shutters) or heating or cooling, which is efficient enough in the climate in northern Mexico but isn't really ideal in wintertime for families not used to huddling under blankets all in one bed. My coworker and his wife had an absolutely MISERABLE time, mainly because the house didn't match their expectations of comfort -- even the most miserable shack in the US is more comfortable. 

Now, from the technical/construction side of things... 

You'd need to study building science a bit before you would want to do what you're proposing. While it's legal and easy to do in many cases (e.g. for plumbing, build a pier and beam foundation with plumbing run in a sealed crawlspace and run any utilities that need to go higher than baseboard level up through a cabinet or a utility closet), other cases that you specify aren't *necessarily* legal or a good idea. For example, the roof structure that you're discussing (single sided, which I'm assuming means decking, tar paper, and shingles on the outside and nothing on the inside) is not legal because you need insulation and you need something to cover that insulation. There are structures that would seem to meet your requirements, but that's not what you asked. 

You would need to be careful when dealing with different building climates in the intended climate. Building things for a place that freezes (e.g. upper Midwest US) is very different than building something for a place that normally doesn't (e.g. southern Texas, where I live) -- because water vapor condenses on a surface that is below the dew point of a structure, you need to follow best practices for your climate as far as where your vapor barriers go and what they look like (paper vs. plastic vs. tyvek), how tightly they get sealed, and where they open to. Again, NOT an issue if you are dealing with something like a monolithic masonry structure, but a huge issue if you're trying to do it with 2x4s and plywood. 

With other details you mentioned, I'm just going to run down them real quick. 

* Pipes are typically covered up so that people don't bump them. When you bump pipes that are under the gas or water pressures common in the US, you weaken the seals, and this leads to more leaks. Sure, you can repair it more efficiently, but you also could've just covered it up in the first place and ninety nine times out of 100 it's not going to leak.
* The same is true of electrical -- the sheathing on wires gets rubbed loose over time, and wires that deliver mains loads will crack and start arcing over 30-50 year timespans.  
* That's not to say that you can't put the majority of wire and plumbing in a crawlspace, closet, covered conduit, or attic where you can access and repair things. I saw a really neat design a few years ago that had a utility room on each level, and all the plumbing and HVAC on all floors ran through those rooms. All of the things that needed those utilities were on the other side of the wall. 
* Don't forget insulation and windows. There's no cheap or easy way to keep these cheap. 
* For a house that is built with no internal load bearing walls (which is many of them), then you can make the interior partition walls as thin as you want. 

Believe it or not, the closest thing that matches your expressed desires is a single or double wide trailer/mobile home. They have all of the utilities run through the crawlspace under the trailer and accessible in closets or cabinets. Everything's modular, and the walls are simple partitions. They are affordable, relatively efficient, and readily available. Set up a utility hookup and a place to park it, and you're good to go. "

superspeck,RealEstate,1389569510.0,"&gt; Yet I can find someone to build a quality website for me. Imagine that.

Will that website still work safely in ten years? Most of the code I wrote ten years ago doesn't run, or isn't safe to run. Apples and oranges. 

&gt; No, it exists for property tax purposes.

How ... how does building code exist for ... property tax purposes? I really don't understand where you're going with that. The building code really doesn't have much to do with property tax purposes. Real estate transactions have much more to do with setting the value of a structure and property for tax purposes. ***That's IT! If we kill all the real estate agents and appraisers, the government will collapse!!***

&gt; enforces it at the point of a gun.

Dude! I don't know where you live, but I'm in the heart of republican gun land... Hell, you can see the George Bush presidential library from my house! ... and the home inspectors here don't pack heat! Man, you really oughta move somewhere safer, like Tijuana! 

&gt; It's seems you're saying that I should be happy to sacrifice for the good of the state. 

Sacrifice *what*, exactly? What are you sacrificing? Your heater cycles less and burns less energy that you have to pay for because the government said you should really insulate to R-60 in your attic? WTF. 

&gt; But it isn't even clear that more insulation is good for the state.

The more energy efficient your house is, the fewer power plants the state needs to build. The fewer power plants that the state needs to build, the fewer bonds it needs to issue and sell to fund power generation, and the lower your electricity rates because there are fewer engineers and support staff to run the power plant. The smaller the electrical generation arm of the government, the smaller the government is overall. It's not just good for the government, it's good for you. 

If your thesis is that the government wants to control everything and subjugate you, then the government would want you to build a less efficient structure so that your entire paycheck went to the government in the form of taxes and electricity costs. 

If your thesis is that the government wants to control how you build your structure so that it's more efficient, then the government actually wants to be smaller and less consumptive, which doesn't match the rest of what you were saying.

Can't decide if you're trolling or serious. If you're serious, you really need to work on becoming more coherent. "

A lot of guys have difficulty orgasming from handjobs/blowjobs, and it's not even necessarily because of excessive masturbation/deathgrip--some guys are just like that. My boyfriend is that way; he assures me that he loves the oral I give him, and that it feels wonderful, but he just doesn't cum from it. And many other guys are the same way. I'm sure this has nothing to do with your skill; please don't worry about it. :)

If you're wondering what can be done to help you feel better about this, though, I may have a suggestion. Try giving him head for 10-15 minutes, (or however long he/you want), then have him jack off while you kiss him/play with his balls/etc. Then right when he's close to cumming, go back down on him and have him finish in your mouth. It works really well for my boyfriend and I, might be worth a shot!

But really, don't think that you're doing anything wrong, or that this is a shortcoming of yours. I'm sure you're just fine, and chances are, he loves getting oral from you regardless of whether or not he cums from it. If you're still feeling unsettled about this, then you can always try talking to him about it; but honestly, I don't think there's any problem with either you or him.

There are (thankfully) lots of exceptions, but in general, you will find that many white people prefer white partners, many black people prefer black partners, and so on. Most people are basically homebodies, they steer towards what's familiar. And the internet, more than pretty much any other location, is dominated by white men (and relevant to your case, most dating profiles are from white men). So on the internet, most likely, there's a bias towards white women, statistically speaking. But again, there are *lots* of individual exceptions. And not because any one skin color or stereotype is ""less desirable"". And it doesn't reflect some kind of universal ""inherent"" trait in all of humanity.

But no, of course there's nothing ""inherently less desirable"" about black women, or about you specifically.

And you're young, if you're looking for guys your own age, they're much more obsessed about who they are, what their identity is, where they belong, than they'll be in 5 years time. And that might just make them more likely to lean towards dating people who look like themselves."

marinersalbatross,DarkFuturology,1389570540.0,"I too do not trust most sources of information, which is why I bounce them against each other as well as looking at who they do stick with. In the conspiracy world I have come across too much in the way of poor science and even worse their ability to read a complete article.  Nominally, citations are quote mined and taken out of context.  This has put me in the point of dismissing as irrelevant most theories, sometimes if they show a spark on originality then I research them further, but even then they are mostly the ramblings of the paranoid.  And I've been reading this stuff for decades so my instinct is fairly well developed. doom and gloom is rarely as bad as it seems. Even the bubble bursting in 08 was predictable, heck as a survivor of the 2000 dot com bust it was plain as day. But many missed it, usually due to optimism. And then we failed to properly respond due to conservative ideals of austerity and self punishment that became so popular, and the ignorant idea that the government's actions are like a homeowner's. 

The problem that I have with this particular theory is the question of who gains?  If you start sterilizing people you remove from most a reason to connect with society. They see no future and they act as such. No capitalist will push for a lower birth rate. That would have zero profitability as you have fewer consumers as fewer workers both of which would be less profits as sales drop and labor prices increase. 

I have a problem with these fear based stories as they do tend to decrease people's feeling of power and influence. Just as demonstrated in the video #3 (although I've only made it halfway), though the thing is that we currently do retain a large amount of power. The voting booth is still the best place to start.  To stir up these anti-science stories is what leads to people like Congressman Gomert and his anti-climate change/ anti-evolution nonsense. It leads to websites like Mercola or Natural News, that hawk bad science day in and day out that is responsible for an resurgence in the preventable diseases.  People need to be taught to be suspicious without being paranoid.  We already have a tendency to dream of a slate cleaning apocalypse.  It is so ingrained in our culture that people fantasize about it and plan for it. And sometimes they act in ways that may just bring it about. "

vorpalblab,diyaudio,1389570816.0,"When I was in my late teens and early twenties, transistors were replacing tube amps.

The knock on the transistors came in the area when playing vinyl and on the playback of some recordings where you came to transients and big amplitude demands on the amp.

Tube amps just gave the best they could and distorted the signal  handling the overload.

Transistors clipped the power to protect their delicate innards. Which fucked the sound up even more.

At that time a lot of bands and studios worked around the distortion issue and with it by deliberately going for the distorted effect.

If you have a good, clean modern amp with plenty of power and you turn it up? It just gets louder.

If you have an old, powerful tubie and crank it? It gets louder, but starts distorting, which gives the impression it is yelling at the limit and stuff. Which sounds pretty fuckin' awesome at 125 db from a pair of 804Es.

Some of that tube amp distortion can kill a woofer or tweeter by demanding excursions of the voice coil the speaker was not designed for."

ballookey,exjw,1389571347.0,"If you start studying the bible honestly and need it to be true or else your faith suffers, then you'll end up with no faith at all because the bible doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

That said, the scripture says 

Matthew 7:13-14
&gt;Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.

This isn't necessarily saying 'few people will join Jehovah's Witnesses, therefore they're righteous'. It's simply saying few people will navigate the path of righteousness.

Think of it like this: Even JW's don't think *all* JW's will automatically get through Armageddon. There are some wolves among their flock. The badge ""Jehovah's Witness"" isn't a free pass, *righteousness* is the pass.

If you believe in the bible, then nowhere does it itemize all the modern names for religious groups. No mention of Baptists, Catholics, Adventists, Episcopals, Protestants, etc…

What you call yourself doesn't matter. Your actions do. If you believe the bible to be true, study what it *actually* teaches and be sure your actions are in line with Jesus' teaching of righteousness.

She is going to meet lots of interesting people throughout her life. Can you imagine *one* reason why she wouldn't cheat with each and every one of them, ""just once"", while she was ""making sure how she felt""? Sure, perhaps the two of you really are made for each others, perhaps you really are a perfect match. That just means she'll come back to you after cheating, won't it? But she'll still occasionally be unsure.

There are two possibilities here:
either what the two of you have is special, in which case telling her ""I can't see you again until you've broken up with your bf so we can be together"" is going to work (because what you two love each others so much that she will be willing to do this), or she is unwilling to break up with her bf, in which case she sees nothing special in you. You're just a cute boytoy she came across, interesting enough to cheat on her bf with, but not interesting enough to actually enter a relationship with.

AlfredHawthorneHill,AskReddit,1389571757.0,"Growing up I never bothered keeping track of the ""hot"" musicians and actors of the day but on some level could not help but know who they were.  Nowadays, while I still cannot avoid knowing of certain ""celebrities"" like the Kardashians, I have transitioned from being around 60% to 99% clueless about what musicians and movies are ""hot"" and ""define"" the current times.  Let us take Katy Perry and Selena Gomez as examples:  I have seen scores of pictures of them on Reddit but could not identify their voices if someone held a gun to my head.  I was shocked to learn that Gomez even sings, but then I recalled that the majority of pictures I have seen of her in passing have been of her onstage in concert.  Then I wonder:  I thought she was on some TV show, so why is she ""in concert""?  Meanwhile I do the math and realize that the musicians I saw on MTV back when it still aired music videos probably have greying hair and children at least in middle school by now.

That said, the most reliable sign that I am aging is the fact that people *retiring* from the NFL and NBA are younger than I am.  I have been used to seeing figure skaters wrapping up their careers in their early 20s; that said, seeing quarterbacks and point guards retire from a 15-year pro career gives me pause, especially when I recall that they *entered* their respective leagues after I graduated college.  When I think of the NBA I envision Jordan winning championships and Shaq as a promising recent pro.  That Shaq is years into retirement with a few championship rings long since adorning his fingers makes me feel like I am caught in a time warp."

I would also tell her that you understand that she's upset because you have to go earlier, but that is no reason to act passive agressively around you, guilt-tripping you and making your last hours unpleasant. She's neither helping you nor herself with this behaviour.


She's not acting that way because she wants to annoy you, but because she doesn't want you to go. She probably wants to see you more often, and may has problems letting her child go. That's something completely natural. You just need to talk to her like an adult.

If she refuses to apologize, I'd go to school regardless of her behaviour. If you stay until she calms down, you're only demonstrating to her that her behaviour works in keeping you at home longer."

Turkstache,flying,1389572459.0,"Guy with an aviation degree here, got all my ratings through Riddle. 

The degree is USELESS. You're better off having something that could get you a job outside aviation. Considering a lot of operations like their pilots to manage other parts of the business, you're more useful to a company if you know how to handle non-flying parts of a business, and will have a back up in case you somehow lose your ability to fly.

Some smaller ops don't like aviation degrees, people that have them tend to be so picky with planes that they'll think to cancel a flight before considering to look up an MEL. They think they have more skill for the hours they have and usually can't back up that notion.

My other posts have more insight into this. I'm currently in US Military flight training, the degree was only useful through my aviation career as the qualification of having a degree. NOBODY so far has cared that it was in aviation.

Go to college for something that could get you hired for good pay. Make it a specialization... something that employers will pay well for. Get scholarships or join sports to study for cheap or free. If you really want to fly, you're better off getting your ratings cheaply, quickly, and safely... and not tying it to your education. University programs will stretch out flying curricula and make you pay tuition for ground school classes that you wouldn't have to at an FBO... IN ADDITION to ground training with your instructor. It gets in the way of getting a proper education.

Success in aviation is strongly tied to networking. It's best that your friend is introduced to the owner of a 135 company through a mutual friend than it is for him to just walk around an airport making offers at random. This is especially true in South Florida, where most of the 135 ops are well established.

Even then, on top of slow FAA involvement, companies are very skittish and flaky when it comes to changing anything about their company. A lot could go wrong and a business owner can lose a lot if the deal doesn't work out. He also has to be careful as HE can lose a lot if he's up against a savvy CEO who doesn't care to take advantage of him. I've heard of plenty of deals being canceled right before signing or companies tanking/splitting right after.

Start making aviation friends wherever possible in the US and in the FAA. It's easier to make these things happen with a network."

Sometimes, especially if I'm wired and having trouble sleeping I'll be big spoon and that seems to guarantee that I'll be out like like a light.  I wonder if it has to do with the fact that I cuddled with stuff animals as a kid, and went through a period as an adult where I still cuddle(d) with my favorite stuffed animal when someone's not in bed with me sometimes.  I don't know why, but it's physically comfortable. 

We're both very physically affectionate people during the day too; I'm not sure if that has anything to do with our ability to cuddle and sleep.  If anything he wants to be touching absolutely as much as possible at all times while sleeping and there will be the slight rare occasion where I want to sleep on my stomach and that just doesn't afford a lot of body contact.  Luckily he is a VERY swift-to-fall-asleep sleeper and heavy sleeper so he doesn't wake up or at least remember my tossing and turning throughout the night. :) 

As a cuddle lover though, I love being with someone who likes as much physical contact as I do.  Falling asleep together is genuinely one of our favorite things to do as a couple, haha!"

dreadfulpennies,52book,1389573803.0,"Last week, I read a couple of books.

I finished up **Assassin's Apprentice** by Robin Hobb. I thought it was all right. The antagonists were really one dimensional, though. Plus, the main character was, like, the world's worst assassin. My library doesn't have the second book in the series, but I might end up buying it sometime.

After that I read **Horns** by Joe Hill. Heart-Shaped Box was one of my favorite books that I read last year. I thought it was a really fun book and I devoured it over a couple of days. I devoured Horns too, but I was honestly sort of disappointed by it. The character set up with the protagonist and their ex-love interest felt too similar to the last book I'd read by him. Plus, it sort of started strong and then... I dunno. I had a real problem with the antagonist in this book, too. [Spoiler](/s ""He received brain damage as a child and lost any capacity for love or empathy. If I found out my best friend not only raped and murdered my SO, but they had been a psychopath the entire time I'd known them, picking up social cues from me so that they could function in society... I dunno. I feel like my reaction would be a little more complicated than, 'I need to murder them back.' "") It didn't feel satisfying.

This week I'm reading **Mortal Engines** by Philip Reeve. The book isn't quite as interesting as its premise just yet, but it's certainly not bad so far."

dreamingofjellyfish,AskWomen,1389573864.0,"If I wanted kids, I think the important thing is how involved the dad is. And marriage isn't a guarantee of that one way or the other. So I'd be fine having a kid out of wedlock, not fine with having a kid where the dad was just there for the fun stuff and monetary support.

Having responsible male and female role models is hugely beneficial. But I'm not okay with saying a mom and dad is essential. That really slights homosexual couples and other less-traditional families that are complete, happy, and healthy.

The Washington Times article you linked is really dealing with low-income areas. A young professional with stable extended family who chooses to be a single parent, is drastically different from someone who is a single parent by circumstance and lives with the constant instability of straddling the poverty line. 

I think this is absurd:

&gt;But what we do is ask, ‘Why does that child need help in the first place?’ And the answer is often it’s because [the child lacks] a responsible and involved father,”

To me this article is creating a social crisis about absent fathers and a lack of focus on the supposed importance of marriage. I disagree with their basic premise. I think the social crisis here is much older, quite simply - poverty and all its attendant problems."

An old friend of mine has a 1.6l '89 MX5 and came around recently so we could show off our respective cars and go for a quick spin. I thought it would be great but honestly I was underwhelmed. Gearbox is short ratio relative to mine, which is saying something as mine is already a short ratio 6spd as opposed to a 5spd. I kept telling him to give it a bit when we went for a drive but he wouldn't, or if he was I couldn't tell. We went for a spin in my car first though and I gave it a windup, so perhaps the induction sounds and chirp into 2nd gave him performance anxiety. ;) The worst part though was just how small the thing is. I expected small, hell my car is obviously a bit cosie, but his felt like you barely had room to fart. The centre dome comes up past your elbows and the whole thing just feels cramped. It's not an attractive centre console/dashboard either, felt a bit ratty to me, though some of that would come down to the condition of his car (which is not amazing, I think he regrets not shopping around).

&gt;Speaking hypothetically, if those people truly believed that 'the bible says that marriage between a black and white person was wrong', then, again there is a difference between believing in the sanctity of something and just doing it because you don't like those people.

That is true...and motive is important. However, believing something kinda prejudiced because of your faith doesn't really make it less prejudiced. And I say that as someone who, for many years, held views that would fit that description because of my faith. Speaking from experience, it's hard to like people when you believe they are living in sin and filth. Saying that you care about them but you disagree with, essentially, who they are as a person doesn't really sound like it's not prejudiced to them.

Favorite moment? Hrm. Homeworld multiplayer. One of the matches I remember vividly, it was a 2 v 2 match on an enormous map. I had been caught with my pants down pretty early into the match and had my economy crippled. Unbeknownst to the opposition, I had placed a resource refinery in a dense patch of RU in a very out of the way location with a carrier.

They were toying with me, occasionally sending small groups to slag my decoy resource collectors I had built up by my mothership... They were  saving me for last while they built up the forces to deal with my ally.

Every time I pumped out a capital ship, I would hyperspace it to my hidden briar patch to join my ever expanding fleet. My teammate was a freaking pro, I have to say. Managed to fight the two of them to a near standstill while I was effectively out of the fight and being sneaky. Finally the moment of the big final battle comes. It is time. The picket ships are on the outskirts of the enemy fleet, wary of my friends bombers. All of my strike craft load into their carriers and my fleet hyperspace jumps into the middle of the enemy formation and begin the utter decimation of the enemy.

Twas glorious."

- My mind needs a lengthy period of time *completely* free of THC in order to recuperate and reconnect with ME, a person who spent a long time buried in a cloud of smokey escapism. 9 days, 30 days, whatever - it's not enough. Indulging occasionally is not a luxury I can afford right now - I've already proved that I'm not capable of this at this time in life.


- The whole ""I can smoke now, because now it's only casual"" game is just that: a game, as you so rightly identified in your post's title. It's a back-door way for your addictive mind to smoke again. Just tell yourself when the urge strikes: this isn't what I'm looking for. Thanks for playing, Brain-O-Mine, but let's find a new game. 


What you're looking for is a fun, chill time to relax and get creative, get loose, get spiritual, whatever weed does for you. So just start looking for other active ways to get there - what you're looking for exists within you. 


I've been through several hang-out sessions with friends lately where they smoked and I didn't, and while it was initially very hard to resist joining in, I've found that it's possible to have a great time smoke-free in this scenario. You can do it! Hope this helped :)"

The NSA stuff I'm worried about backdoor compromising that is hidden such that a simple firmware overwrite won't erase it (i've heard this is possible, as per one of the released snowden papers). Not so much that I'd be targeted by the NSA, but because the presence of a backdoor means some one else could find and exploit it maliciously.

The and easy-connect buttons and PINs are general security risks, as I last heard a router with a PIN could be compromised in about a minute, completely ignoring the normal encryption. The reason for this is that the 8-digit pin is done in 2 4 digit pairs, with the first set of four being confirmed before worrying about the second set. (this reduces maximum number of guesses to 20 thousand, instead of 10 million). This may have been fixed as that exploit was talked about over a year ago, but I haven't heard anything about it being fixed.

so I just want something reasonably secure that won't be easily hacked because of some stupid 'easy access' button that makes it easy access for hackers too. "

I'm talking about engineering of relationships. Going to your friend and saying nasty things about you, and thereby turning your friends against you. Creating large groups to torment you, etc.

Body policing is something that's largely only ever happened to me by other girls, and I've only ever been catcalled by other women, same with the physical touching in an effort to make me feel unsafe.

But I'm largely talking about [indirect bullying](http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/female-bullying.html). It's not about evil cutting remarks as it is about creating social isolation by turning everyone else against you. This is about using other people as weapons against you. Not about verbal insults and body policing and the like (These have always been equal opportunity).

Basically, the idea that somehow what girls do is defanged and harmless is presented as normal in society (and it's sexist as all get out), and it's really fucking harmful to the victims of girls. Honestly, the things you're saying to me have been a bit triggering in a way that feels like the dismissal of my feelings and the sort of gaslighting I got as bullying growing up.

MVR - Shitty software so you can have your computer talk to the eVic.  
VV - Variable Voltage.  
VW - Variable Wattage

The other two modes are time based vv/vw changes as you vape.

VV is what most people use. More voltage get you more power and wattage. VW does the same thing with wattage. Wattage goes up exponentially as your voltage goes up. I tend to work in VW mode that way I could see my total wattage. However these days I rely on VV as it is the easier 2nd variable to ohms law. To understand more look up to ohms law. Ohms law has 4 components Voltage, Resistance, Wattage, and Amps. Ohms and Voltage are the two variables that we tend to took at when doing Ohms Law calculations.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1389576502.0,"&gt;All the women automatically assumed the guys that have issues with black women's feminine nature assumed ""it's the hair"" and you know what, it really isn't. 

Huh, I didn't  notice. I haven't gone back and read all the comments - I've just been replying to whatever finds its way to my inbox and leaving it at that.

&gt;I have more issues with 1. lack of makeup 2. lack of style / fashion sense 3. Ghettoized women masculine overall behaviors, starring, mean mugging, not gentle, not nice in general, not feminine.

I've been lucky enough to grow up in neighbourhoods that have been safe and relatively comfortable...however, it seems to me that if you grow up in a ghetto, it's a rough environment and you'd learn to act tough and hard as a means of protecting yourself. If you are surrounded by gangs and drugs and guns and violence, being all soft and feminine and gentle could make you seem weak and vulnerable, an easy target. Giving off the air that you aren't someone to be messed with would be wise.

&gt;The irony of this thread being that most black women literally do not understand what being feminine means. Dressing up is part of it, a good part of it but that's not all it. Simply.. ACTING like a female.

And what *does* a ""female"" act like? I can't speak for all women, but I really despise being told that I should do this/look like that just because I'm female. Femininity is not a universal thing - each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes feminine behaviour. If it comes naturally to a woman, great. If not, there's no reason she should have to be someone she's not. 

So many aspects of what our society pushes on women as ""femininity"" is limiting - you have to have fancy hair, nails done, makeup done, clothes that are pretty but often impractical (high heeled shoes, for example), and you somehow have to manage to have big boobs and a tiny waist even if that is a physical impossibility for you. It eats up a lot of your time, it can get expensive, and there's no good reason why you should have to put so much effort into looking cute all the time. We are so much more than what we look like, but looks are a huge part of what constitutes femininity in our society. Again, if it comes naturally to a woman, great! But for the women out there who don't like makeup, have no interest in looking sexy, and feel more at home in jeans and a tee shirt, it's stifling and frustrating to be judged for just being themselves.

As for the rest, I think that everyone should be kind, polite, gentle when necessary. Those things aren't just for women - they're things that make anyone a nice person.

You said it was ""scummy"" that people were saying bad things about him/ not showing the dead man respect.

As I said before, any Palestinian figure-- ""guilty"" of nothing but defending Palestinian rights or Palestinian people-- could drop dead and the Israelis, or at least the centre-right wing of Israeli society, would leap about in orgiastic glee.

&gt; I quite enjoy your belief that if a person is a piece of shit, it's alright to make up totally fake quotes for them. They deserve go to hell, don't they? So let's just make them a boogeyman and add world domination to their list.

I said that posting quotes that can't be verified is a stupid idea, especially considering that Sharon did enough bad things, or presided over them, or ordered them, that are all historical and verifiable.

So no, I didn't say ""it's alright to make stuff up about him"".

&gt; But I also think he later in his life did a lot of good. Pulling back from Gaza was a great move that I supported. 

Yes, one good decision on his part. Of course, the 8,000 ""settlers"" had no right to be there in the first place, and it's not as though Sharon or the Knesset seriously were interested in really trying to work out a lasting solution.

It's ""we'll do one good thing and then you have to accept all of our designs and whatever we do in the West Bank and elsewhere is acceptable and you can't oppose it"".

They're both about kids.

There is something so special about being there for a kid and being responsible for helping them grow and learn.  Do you remember what it was like to learn something that you found really exciting??  Somewhere--there was a teacher who was maybe even more excited for you than you were for yourself (even if you didn't realize it).  

Why get into it?  Because at some point you realize that feeling from above is more important than anything else.  Period.  

Favorite part?  The kids.  Always the kids.

Is every day a holiday?  Of course not.  Some days are awful.  They day you give the test and everyone fails and you know it's your fault.  The day some kids get in a fight in class.  The day that kid tells you fuck off who you loved.  The day you find out that kid is getting bullied.  The day you find out they're hungry....or getting hit....or homeless.  Those are the worst days.

But....someone has to be there for them."

Some more random details:

* hit first polytrap in the quest a very short after being able to make GDSM - would have had no MR ~200 turns earlier.

* blindfold finally found at turn ~34k IIRC. Not being able to check levels for dangerous foes made (m)mf and n (*and* many others) a lot more dangerous for longer than usual, but at least I had telepathy when I got blinded externally...

* surprisingly good results on the silver spear. While I had to whack and whack A and @ on astral forever it seems, conflict took the bite out of most of it, and then I had plenty of WoD and WoTeleport to clear my way. Zapping tele is a technique I learned late on astral, and it really is effing amazing if you don't hit a rider with it (which is easy to avoid).

* I also probably didn't give magic missile the proper credit - I had *terrible* ranged capabilities without it, but since I had the eye I could cast feely as long as I watched my hunger levels (collected C/K rations for this, which can be eaten in 1 turn each). At level 20+, magic missile was the FoD-like assist that took out anything that got sidetracked by conflict.

* I gained - by my own rough count - *every* level after 14 due to PoGL or wraith corpses (all of which dropped on graveyard levels)! Level 28 in the end, remember! oO"

Willravel,DaystromInstitute,1389577014.0,"**Teaser**:

Kirk is meeting with Spock and Bones, going over last minute details. Kirk is explaining to Spock how a civilization, let's call them the Trellians, is not dissimilar from humans in the mid to late 20th century. Bones mentions that the Trellians had a devastating world war a few decades ago, and that three states emerged as superpowers and were still locked in a childish cold war ostensibly about philosophical differences. Kirk mentions that, actually, the philosophies of the three nations aren't all that different, and that public and private leaders on each side exaggerate the differences between them in order to continue amassing power with the tacit approval of their citizenry. Two of the nations had working warp coils, and one had just found a stable method of manufacturing antimatter, while the other two were using nuclear power for their warp projects. Kirk mentioned how the USSR on Earth launched Sputnik, inspiring the United States to join them in the space age and trigger a space race. 

Spock mentions how there was a similar instance on his world of pre-Surak nations competing for dominance of the space around Vulcan, but that it had happened in the early 4th century, nearly 1500 years before Sputnik. 

Kirk wonders aloud how humans in the 1960s might have reacted to first contact. Kirk's hailed from the bridge that they're entering orbit of Trellia 4. 

Cue the theme. The episode is entitled ""*First Contact.*""

**Act One**

The episode begins with Kirk making a log about being contacted by Starfleet command and the Federation Starfleet liaison to deliver a senior Federation diplomat to make first contact with a species just in the process of moving out of being industrial, which is in the final phases of constructing a prototype warp drive. Kirk had been reading hundreds of reports and documents about the Trellians in preparation for being present for first contact, about culture, history, technology, geography, and sociology of the people. While he feels as prepared as he could ever be, he still feels the same trepidation he normally feels before any first contact situation. 

Kirk enters the bridge. Uhura reports heavy communications in the radio frequencies. The whole world is buzzing about the impending warp test by the nation which had warp coils and which had towed the nuclear vessel into space. Kirk sits, and calls for the ambassador to come to the bridge to witness the species first experiment with moving faster than light, but Spock notes that the ambassador would likely have no interest in such things. Just as Spock says this, the turbolift doors open and reveal Ambassador Sarek, Spock's father. Sarek corrects Spock, dispassionately stating that witnessing new species break the warp barrier provides insight into the past of all warp-capable species, including the Vulcans. Spock lifts an eyebrow for a moment. 

In space, the small craft detaches from a set of large booster rockets, which begin falling. Inside the pod, we find a young woman with bright pink skin and purple hair, a fierce look of determination in her eye, verifying her state of readiness to her mission control, a transmission which is also being picked up by Enterprise. Once all systems are ready, she quietly says, ""The future begins today, not tomorrow."" She presses a series of lighted rectangular buttons and a primitive nacelle emerges from the bottom of the pod. She pressed forward on a lever, and is suddenly at warp. The pod shakes violently, as she reports back real-time telemetry and system functions. ""Point five C. Point seven. Point right. Point nine."" A pause. Kirk leans forward in his chair as the bridge of the Enterprise is absolutely silent. Even Sarek seems to allow himself the indulgence of feeling the anticipation. 

There's a flash of light. ""Mission control, I have a report: mission successful. I'm holding at 1.1 C."" The crew, save for Spock and Sarek, erupt into celebration. 

After a few moments, the pod drops out of warp and turns around for the return trip. The young pilot reengages her warp engines, and begins the jump home. Her smile begins to disappear, however, when she notices a flashing red light to her right, on the display. 

Spock, looking up from his scope, reports that there's a dangerous fluctuation in her warp field, and that she's running the risk of it destabilizing. Kirk, in a split second, makes his decision. ""Take us out from behind this moon and set a course, best possible speed."" The Enterprise emerges from behind the Trellian moon and moves to intercept the pod. ""The warp field has destabilized captain.""

The young pilot is being violently shook about in her chair as the pod spirals out of control, still far from her world. ""Mayday! Mayday! The warp field has collapsed!""

Just then the Enterprise emerges from warp and a tractor beam catches the pod, ending its gyroscopic spinning. Kirk orders the pod be brought on board. Sarek protests, but Kirk replies, ""This young lady is the Zephram Cochrane of these people, she damn well deserves to get back home!"" 

Bones and a nurse arrive at the shuttle bay at the same time as Kirk, Spock and Sarek. There's smoke coming from the pod, and through the windshield, they can see the young pilot had passed out from the force. Bones gets to deliver a ""Damn it man, get this thing open!"" while a few red shirts pry open the hatch. There's smoke everywhere, and everyone is squinting to see through it. Suddenly a bright yellow beam emerges from the smoke, heading right toward Spock. Sarek leaps in front of Spock, taking the shot in a shoulder. He falls to the ground, with Spock immediately jumping to his side. The red shirts draw their phasers, but Kirk orders them to hold their fire. ""*Everyone* hold your fire."" The young pilot stumbles out, clearly still feeling dizzy and not fully conscious. Kirk, from behind and just to the side of her, grabs her pistol as she passes out in his arms. Bones, treating Sarek's wound, gives Kirk a look as Kirk, with a little sweat on his brow, gives his best concerned look. 

**Act Two**

In sickbay, Sarek and the young pilot are in beds, with Bones and the nurses attempting to treat both. Kirk attempts to console Spock, but Spock responds that he doesn't require any consolation. After a beat, Bones reports that the young pilot is simply in shock, and should just get a little rest before they wake her, but that Sarek was hit with a primitive disruptor, and that after surgery he would need a month to recover. Spock suggests postponing first contact, but Kirk explains that first contact had already been made, gesturing to the unconscious pilot, and that they had a duty to the Trellian people to introduce them to the interstellar community now that they were capable of reaching other systems. Spock is forced to agree with Kirk's logic. 

Kirk orders Bones to wake the pilot. We get the usual ""Where am I? Who are you?"", to which Kirk answers as completely and as honestly as he can that he represents a Federation of hundreds of warp-capable worlds, and that he was on the most important mission in the Federation, first contact with an emerging civilization which was ready to join the larger community. The pilot, called Kara, responds with skepticism, thinking that she's still passed out and is having a dream. Kirk takes her out of sickbay to a window, looking down on Trellia 4. Her entire disposition changes when she realizes that she's not dreaming. She spends time with Spock after apologizing for almost killing Spock's father, and Spock explains some of the Federation to her, and how Starfleet's primary missions are of peaceful exploration and scientific progress. Kara's practically giddy at the prospect of being offered the opportunity to join such a group. Kirk mentions that there are a lot of people down there who are interested in getting her home, and offers to beam her back to her home country, but asks something in return. After her pod is repaired and she lands safely, she has to use her fame and clout to arrange a meeting of delegates from each nation. Ostensibly, this meeting would be about the future of warp for all Trellian people, but in truth, this would be Kirk's opportunity to make contact and set right the process. She agrees. As Kara's saying her goodbyes before getting back into her pod, which Scotty had repaired, she gives Spock a little peck on the cheek. Kirk gives Spock literally the most smarmy look in the history of the Federation, as Spock doesn't quite know how to react. 

Spock meets with Kirk once more, as Kirk is in his office pouring over the documents again. Spock inquires as to Kirk's plan, implying in his own Vulcan way that Kirk is not the diplomat that Sarek is, and that Kirk may not be up to the task. Kirk admits that he's not certain that he can get the job done, either, but believes that the risk of not making contact far outweighs the risk of making contact at this point. Kirk mentions that Spock is similarly well trained in diplomacy, like his father, and says that he'll stand a better chance with his science officer's help. Spock and Kirk get to work formulating the best course. 

On Trellia, Kara's met heavy resistance from her own government. They insist that while they represent freedom and progress, the other two nations represent tyranny and are too closed minded. Kara, eventually, gives her government an ultimatum: there will be a meeting, the only decision they have to make is whether or not to attend. 

*continued below*"

Willravel,DaystromInstitute,1389577030.0,"**Act Three**

The meeting between the representatives of the three nations has already started poorly. A Kara is trying to get their attention, the representatives continue making accusations and counter accusations. Each is convinced that their nation is righteous and that the other nations are basically evil, and they simply shout past each other. One nation claims the other is arming a poor neighboring country for an attack, while another accuses them of arming traitorous insurgents inside their borders. Each claim seems eerily similar to some of the moves the United States and the USSR are making in the real 1960s. Eventually, Kara stands up and slams her fists into the table, causing a huge noise. A hush falls over the representatives as Kara has, at least momentarily, captured their attention. 

Kara talks about her childhood, about seeing the daily broadcasts from all three nations about progress in areas of aeronautics, propulsion, and early space exploration. She knows precisely what she was doing when the first Trellian, from another nation, landed on their moon, and how that day there were no nations, only Trellians. She talks about her love of the weekly science fiction broadcasts, and how her best friend, who was just like Kara, had to move away back to her home country because of bigotry from her own people. Kara says that her story, the story of growing up inspired, working hard, and achieving something wonderful, could be the story of any child from the three nations, and how her effort should unite, not divide. She then alludes to the possibility that now Trellia had developed the ability to leave their system, they needed to grow in order to prepare themselves for the next frontier, the *final frontier*. Despite her impassioned speech, Kara's met with hostility and skepticism from the representatives. 

Suddenly Kirk and Spock beam into the center of the room. The representatives are taken aback, terrified of what they don't understand. Kirk takes a step forward. ""We come in peace.""

Kara stands beside Kirk and Spock, and assures the representatives that they are in no danger, but rather are part of the most important moment in Trellian history. She explains that she would likely be dead had it not been for the aliens' help, and that they represented the best possible future for all Trellians. The representative from Kara's government stands up and calls her a traitor, grabs a gun from one of the guards, and attempts to shoot Kirk. Kara jumps in front of the beam, which hits her square in the chest. The representative, seeing what he'd done, drops the gun in horror and shock, as the guards grab him. ""I didn't mean to. I'm sorry..."" he manages to say before being dragged away. 

Dying in Kirk's arms, Kara whispers, ""Don't let it end like this. My people are ready, but our leaders stand in the way."" She looks up to Spock. ""Don't let the foolish actions of the few prevent the good of the many."" Her eyes close. Kirk is devastated, and the whole room falls silent. 

The camera angle of the show changes from third person to second, as the camera meets with the perspective of the representatives, looking at Kirk. Kirk speaks directly into the camera for the first time in the series, addressing the representatives of Trellia, but also the audience. 

""You now face those most serious of choices. Your entire world stands on the brink of either annihilation or transcendence. You have the potential within yourselves to set aside petty differences, to let go of selfish greed for wealth and power, to lay down your arms and work together to become something greater. This fear and hatred which exist inside of you are not intrinsic to your being, rather I can see that you cry out for optimism, cooperation, liberty and justice for all, regardless of where you're born. 

""My world was once as yours, with a few men in positions of great power navigating the entire planet on a course for extinction. We endured three world wars in which millions of innocent people suffered and died for their selfishness and their smallness. It wasn't until we ventured out into the stars, until we came into contact with new life and new civilization that we realized how petty our fighting really was, how small our differences, how great our commonalities. 

""You're on the brink of the final frontier. Like us, in time, you too may seek out new life and new civilizations, boldly going where no man has gone before. All that next phase requires is that you allow that ember of hope which existed in Kara to find flame in you all.""

The episode ends in silence. "

temp9876,Accounting,1389577538.0,"I think perhaps you and others are misunderstanding me.

&gt;A lot of people choose not to, since they're billing more than 8 hours anyways

But that's the point isn't it?  A full work day is 7.5 hours (when you're entitled to a 30 minutes of paid breaks) so everything beyond that is working for free.  You talk about the freedom to get up and walk around like it is a privilege you aren't entitled to, but in fact you are working unpaid overtime for several hours a week.  Some firms actually address this or attempt to, they have their billable hour expectations in busy season but you get OT pay or time off in lieu when it is slow.  But a lot of firms don't.  It's not like you get to work less than 8 hours in slow season, even if you aren't fully billable during that time.  People who don't understand what they are entitled to or what basic labour standards are outside of the industry are bad at assessing the demands placed on them or determining what appropriate work life balance is.

So to be blunt, the system looks like it is working because you don't know any better.

This is simply one example where I find people in accounting are generally lacking in real world knowledge and experience, the breaks thing is just one example, and obviously I don't mean YOU since I don't know your situation, I'm speaking in generalities about the industry.  The system works for the partners.  They pay peanuts and make demands and the people working for them don't know that they are being exploited, or to what extent, so as they move up the ranks they become part of the problem."

We both share a very high sex drive, and when having sex is a multiple-times-a-day event, you can imagine how frustrating it can get knowing that she's keeping this secret, forcing me to keep my secret that I know her secret, so there's this silly no-intimacy bubble around one of her erogenous zones.

In her defense though, some women have very sensitive boobs. I don't always like my boobs being touched, because some days they're more sensitive (and ticklish) than others. It's like how some guys like having their gooch touched, while others are very sensitive and don't like that kind of contact. Boobs are typically an erogenous zone, but not on every woman. She just may not like that in general.

She probably hasn't told you about her implants because of the negative stigma that can be attached to them. Let her tell you on her own terms if she decides to, because if you blurt out ""you have nice implants!"", there's a good chance she may be made to feel incredibly insecure. 

&gt;What are some ways I could maybe vaguely reinforce the fact that I am attracted to her just the way she is, without seeming like I would be turned off to find out that ""just the way she is"" is not the way she always was? 

I've mentioned this in other comments before. If you want to make someone feel beautiful, don't flat out tell them ""you're pretty"". Tell them the specific, oddball, little things about them that make them beautiful to you, that they probably haven't even noticed, and do it at unexpected times. For example, tell her how much you love the way her eyes crinkle when she smiles while you're out grocery shopping. Or in the middle of watching a movie, look over at her and tell her how cute you think her ears are. Or give her a little kiss and tell her how much you love how she styles her hair, or the way she walks, or how she carries herself. But do it when she's not expecting it, at mundane times. She'll be caught off guard, and in the best way possible. And she may blush, in which case you damn well better tell her how cute it is when she blushes, which will make her blush more. Win-win.

Turkstache,flying,1389578023.0,"It is very specific to the school. The school I instructed at was mainly part 61, and me and 3 other instructors could do 141. 

141 allows fewer hours because the program has a bit of FAA oversight and the instructors need to have 141 check rides. However, the quality of instruction you will get is never guaranteed with any institution. I've had recently certificated instructors at ERAU and flown with extremely seasoned instructors elsewhere. The opposite has alos occured. Regardless of where you go, it's a crapshoot. The best instructor I've ever had was somebody who was assigned to me after my first two instructors got new jobs. I'd never learned so much in so little time.

Look for a place that doesn't make you pay everything up front, but allows you to buy blocks of time for a reduced rate as an option. Often times it'll cost 5% to 10% less to buy 10 hours of rental time in advance. The instructor rates at part 61 schools may or may not be dictated by the instructor you hire. The rates at 141 schools are generally much higher and you will pay the same whether you have the guy with the 100% pass rate or the guy with the 70%.

Flight schools generally have a core group of instructors who wont or can't get other jobs, surrounded by people who are just trying to get hours to move on to the next better job. FBOs generally have the option of meeting and choosing your instructor. You'll go at a slower pace this way, but you are more in control of your options.

In the end, THE PEOPLE YOU WORK FOR DON'T CARE WHAT SCHOOL YOU WENT TO. You're looking for a place that will keep you safe, offer you quality instruction without hassle, and have opportunities to fly when convenient for you. If you want to be successful on check rides, most of the work will be done at home anyway... with your knowledge of procedures, systems, and regulations. You instructor should be proficient at teaching you air work. If he can't demonstrate something to the standards he holds you to, it's not likely he's going to be much good at teaching you.

YoungFolks,asktransgender,1389578288.0,"Your therapist is an asshole, and it doesn't sound like you have a dissociative disorder, wtf? He's an idiot too. What you described sounds a lot more like depression, anxiety, and identity issues, not dissociation. Get a better therapist. One with experience in gender and/or LGBT issues. 

I don't know if you're trans, but it sounds like you're definitely not feminine. And it sounds like you're a much happier person dressing and looking like a guy, so keep doing that.

Some things to consider to figure out if you're trans:

* if you had a choice between being born male or female which would you pick? How strongly?

* if you could dress like a guy, and act like a guy all you wanted, and it was absolutely acceptable for girls to do that, would you be happy with that?

* would you want hormone therapy? Do you want only particular effects of hormones, or the whole shebang?

* you wake up tomorrow looking exactly as you do now, except everyone else thinks you've always been a guy. How do you feel?

BadW01fRose,LARP,1389579190.0,"Hi! My boyfriend is main staff for Mirror Mirror and I will be NPCing Madrigal! (I PC MM) we are on the east coast. I have many friends who play Cottington and Invictus. A lot of people come from the VA area to play MM and Mad for this very reason. Stickjocky-ness need not apply. I was pretty anti-stick jock myself...until I got into accellerant. Its easy to play and the rules are easy to follow so combat becomes a LOT more fun and you'll find yourself dumpster diving into combat looking to scrap with anything that will so much as glance at you. 

That being said, a lot of people at accelerant games have come over to leave behind the cliques and the dramas. Any game that's based in theatre (and theatre itself) is always going to have drama. This is not necessarily because the people are dramatic, but because artists, creative types, and those of us who are drawn to LARP have very specific ideals on what our characters and roleplay mean to us. So we fight for them. We just need to work alongside eachother to combat it. Games like MM with characters from all different worlds lend themselves to helping to mesh. We're not 'team' based. It's very much a large group of individuals. A lot of NERO people have brought their characters over, but staff is keeping an eye out for us. I'd recomment either traveling to play our game (Shameless self promotion) or looking for something running on accellerant. Stay away from VtM if you dont like drama. Politics=Drama."

Here's the thing though.  People aren't really seeing you clearly.  I'm quite attractive, not objectively, not if you studied an image of me, but because I am confident and positive and people enjoy my company (I work at that) and people don't see clearly beyond that.

Self image is so much more mental than people realize.  I was 7 months pregnant and people said I didn't look pregnant at all.  That's how oblivious they were to my actual figure.  They just don't see the details.  I can gain weight, lose weight, break out, dress up, whatever.  People don't really see it.  We get an image in our head and forget to update it, we do it to others but we are especially harsh on ourselves.

So what is this diary after all? If it's really telling the future, then it's affecting the future too. That would certainly make it powerful, wouldn't it? **Or else, of course, the other possibility is that the diary doesn't actually tell the future, but Ringo is making it the future instead.**

I wanna compare this with Himari's revival through the penguin hat. It was her fate to die, but the hat allowed her to break fate and live again. On the other hand, Ringo's diary forces her to follow fate. So, they're opposed, right?

But then consider that bolded line, and how that might do cause another parallel with Himari. What if we say that Ringo is the one making the future, that there is no ""fate"" but only her choice that creates fate. Diametrically, Himari may have broken her ""fate"" by being revived, but maybe it was fate to be revived, as well? 

So maybe the point being made here is that fate and choice are one and the same, two sides of the same coin. That fate determines your choices, but your choices also determine fate?

I dunno where I'm going with that."

Turkstache,flying,1389582015.0,"Networking is building multiple series of contacts so that you are more likely to have mutual connections between you and people you don't know. Generally people are more likely to trust someone they met through a friend or close contact, so...

Say you were applying for ZYX Airlines and you hear that their Director of Operations (DO) will be doing the interview. If you had no mutual connections, you might as well be talking to a complete stranger.

However... if, through networking, you met the company's Chief Pilot (CP) and made a good impression on him... he can not only secure an interview for you, he can put in a good word with the DO so that he thinks of you more positively during the interview.

This can also backfire for you AND the CP if you totally suck at the interview, as the DO will have expectations that you didn't meet, and the CP's credibility will be questioned.

This is basically how I secured my second and third jobs in aviation. I met the first CP by chance and the second through the job he gave me. That CP was calling other companies to try securing me a job. If he were to ask me to reciprocate, he left a good impression on me so I would. Networking is that simple.

The best way to go about it is to make good impressions on people where you work and let those connections develop naturally. Don't be cocky, don't be a douchebag, don't be clueless.

Yes, I'm here to help, but questions like ""What do you mean by network?"" are best answered through your own research. It is one of the basic concepts of business, sales, and politics. You lose points with people if you don't know such things, especially when you have the internet to look up the concept.

Costs may or not equal out between 61 and 141 because it's really dependent on your skill, the cost of equipment rental, ground instruction, and instructor fees. If you don't know how to look up aviation publications and study, you will pay more in ground instruction when you fail to meet standards in questioning. You will pay more after a failed checkride for further instruction and a second checkride.

You'll get done in fewer hours ONLY if you're good enough to meet FAA standards in the prescribed minimums. It's not 141 that will get you through faster as much as a flight school that has time you will. The more often you fly, the more retention of skill you have between flights. If the flight school cannot accommodate you as much as you can go, you might not get to fly as often as you need to learn at you optimum pace.

1. Try getting your liner closer to your lashline so it's one continuous line. Wow, so many ""lines"" in that sentence. I like to tightline with a black kohl liner that's nice and soft. When you're done lining, just check for any visible skin spots between liner and lashes. 

2. And the other thing is no big deal, but I'd say use a brow gel to get a nice sharp line, (again with the lines! Oh my!) especially on the underside of your brows. I use e.l.f.'s brow kit. I line the inner under part with the powder, blending into the head of my brows, then I use the gel to outline the outer part right at the arch (mine is more like an angle, whatevs) and the tail, and then the outer under part for the bottom of the tail. Fill in any sparse spots with gel, set it with powder. It takes some tweaking for sure, but a little practice will make perfect. I looked like Drake one of the first times I tried that method. Now I don't use the gel on the inner parts of my brows.

Chances are you've spent more on consoles and hardware than most PC gamers.

Considering Steambox isn't for sale yet, that's a pretty bold claim, guess we'll see if/when it comes out.

I definitely recommend going to see a PT because they can tailor a treatment/regimen to your specific needs - but if you're interested, here's what works for me:
1. Exercising my glutes, hips, and core muscles to correct a muscle imbalance. Quads doing all the work = knee pain. 
2. Correcting my stride (so my feet hit the ground below my body rather than in front of it) to reduce stress on my knees.
3. Reducing tension in the surrounding muscles with a foam roller and icing after exercise to reduce potential inflammation and pain.
4. Avoiding running on hard surfaces like asphalt whenever possible to minimize impact.
5. Listening to my body - if my knees need a break for a day or two, I take one. It's all part of the process.

I have seen 'discussions' on this topic spiralling out into slurs of an opinion holder's mental capability 

&gt;3. History (sort of)

I don't know. People are ignorant of various aspects of history. At least, I haven't come across a drunken discussion where there was a circlejerk on Indian history.

&gt;4. Dressing style (??) -saree etc is unique of our culture

Huh? What? No. Most women I know are not great fans of the sari - it's cumbersome to don, takes a lot of preparation, is not convenient, etc. The only saris my wife has are those we were forced to buy for our wedding.

As for other 'dressing styles', nope. I am not sure if anyone feels the Nehru jacket or the Gandhi topi are 'binding elements'.

&gt;5. Food?

Ha ha. You have never been called a bloody Madrasi for preferring idli over aloo paratha?

No - I think what binds us is what we hate and what threatens us. Pakistan, Kashmir, China in Assam, Bangladeshi border-crossers, Sri Lankans have our fishermen, the rising cost of corruption, inflation, etc."

thesilvertongue,changemyview,1389584138.0,"&gt; How do you suppose your mental health and self esteem would fare if you woke up every day under the impression you have a ""mental disorder""?

It changes absolutely nothing. 

Honestly, absolutely nothing. I was diagnosed with a mental disorder (ADHD-PI) at the age of 8 and it never really had any impact on my self esteem. Understanding my mental problems helped me realize I wasn't alone and my mental problems weren't my fault. Being born with a disorder is out of your control and it's nothing to be ashamed about. Getting this diagnosis enabled me to take helpful medication and find strategies to focus and function in daily life.

&gt;The tag of ""mental disorder"" has caused a lot of anguish for many people. 

That's a personal problem. Most people with mental disorders accept the diagnosis doctors give them without being offended by the term ""mental disorder"". Many people take it a step further and claim they have mental disorders (mostly ADD, OCD, bipolar, depression and ADHD) that they're not even remotely close to having. These terms mental disorders usually don't have any noticeable affect on self esteem. 

I see no reason why we should change the term to avoid offending a minority of people. "

That doesn't sound depressing at all. It just makes me think that the real key to success doesn't come from things taught in school. There are really only 4 things you really need to be successful. They are a decent understanding of a number of topics and a talent or good understanding in 1, the mind set for success that often cant be taught in a classroom, knowing people who are already successful to help you out, and timing. Having as many of the first 3 as possible really helps with the last one and really you can just get away with the first and the last. "

I realized I had a whole list of people I was holding grudges against because it didn't feel safe to just let them back into my life, so I had to remember what they did to me. It's subtle what forgiving is, and it doesn't mean forgetting. It means dropping the anger. More like, ""What's done is done, I'm moving on.""  It was helpful to me, I'm more relaxed. That said, I could see it would be really hard and maybe also not feel safe, if it's your mom.

Secret_Wizard,AskReddit,1389584598.0,"Tom was excited beyond words. He had asked the girl he's had a crush on for years to go to prom with him - and she said yes! Indeed, Tom had decided, he should make this the greatest prom date ever seen in the school. Every detail would be perfect, and his date would be happy. And maybe they would be crowned Prom King and Queen! Yes, that is what Tom wanted. So a week before the big night, the teen set out to organize the date.

The first thing on his list was to get himself a high-rate Tuxedo! Off to the fanciest suit shop in town he went. It took a bit of shopping, being very selective at this time, but eventually Tom settled on a classic black tuxedo. He went to purchase it, but found an absolutely enormous line for the sole cash register. Tom could do nothing but groan and wait patiently.

Some time later, the sun lower in the sky, Tom emerged from the shop and made for his next destination: The limousine rental place. It was a short distance away, but traffic was thick indeed. It was nearly sundown when Tom arrived, and much to his dismay there was a long, long line of other teenagers who had the same idea filling up the place. Tom grinned and bared it; this would be worth it in the end, he told himself.

The moon was high in the sky by the time Tom returned home. Somehow, traffic back to his neighborhood was even worse than it was in the city. At last, the exhausted boy collapsed into his bed and drifted to slumber.

All too soon, it was the morning of the prom. Pushing through the intense butterflies in his stomach, Tom knew there was yet more that needed to be done, and soon. He went first to the barber to get himself a sleek and handsome haircut, sure to woo his date. Much to his dismay, the only decent shop in town was stuffed to the brim with customers. This was going to be a long wait, indeed.

Finally, leaving with a trimmed head of hair, Tom drove at once to the flower shop. He sought a red Rose to place in his date's dress. He should have known better; the flower shop was packed. Long line after long line! How poor, his luck! Thankfully, a vibrant red rose was available to Tom, much to his relief. And so, all was set and ready for tonight's wonders.

The rented limo rolled up to her house, and Tom stepped out to greet his d-- Holy smokes! She was beautiful! She was pretty in class before, but with that makeup, that dress, that hairstyle, that bright smile... Tom could only trip over his own mouth as he stammered greetings. The two got in the back of the limo and drove off to the school.

Naturally, there was a long line to get inside. Something about keeping it orderly and not packed at once, Tom had overheard. But lines hardly mattered now, he had the girl of his dreams to chat with. Slowly, ever so slowly, they made their way into the building. The night proceeded just as Tom had hoped. Absolute perfection. He could tell that she was having a fantastic time.

After a romantic slow dance, she looked up and into his eyes. ""Baby, I'm thirsty... Get me a drink?"" ""Of course, anything!"" And with that, Tom made for the refreshments. There was no punch line. "

nullomore,AskFeminists,1389584781.0,"I think a lot of people have the same feeling as you regarding the word ""patriarchy,"" and it's pretty reasonable given what the word sounds like. So dictionary.com says that it's (paraphrased) a social structure where that father tends to be the authority figure. To me, that doesn't imply that the male figure gets 100% of the benefits - it just means that they tend to be in charge. The way I see it, there are obvious downsides to this, the most direct being that men are expected to be in charge.

Anyway, I understand your discomfort with the word, and I suspect that a lot of people who claim that patriarchy doesn't exist are thinking that patriarchy means that males get 100% benefit and females get 100% detriment.

One better - Get an education that includes a placement program. 

Why?

1. He will be working with computers and not getting people coffee.
2. It will make sure he gets placed somewhere that's still relevant (Eg, not at blackberry or yahoo)
3. It gives him a reference from someone in the right department, and if you are good, a potential job lead. 
4. You still get a Degree/Diploma. These are better then certs because they *never expire*.

lavenderblue,TwoXChromosomes,1389585134.0,"I hear you're straight. I completely completely hear that and I'm not trying to tell you differently.

But in case it would be helpful to someone else, I didn't like kissing guys because I *wasn't* straight and just didn't admit it.  I didn't even really realize it until I kissed a girl and went ""oh.  OH.  Kissing isn't just this sort of warm wet thing.  It's, like, with a *person.*  And it's *together.*""  

Every guy I had kissed had felt one way and every girl a completely different nice way.  Until I kissed the man I am going to marry.  For some reason kissing him felt like kissing a person too.

The only thing I can say to you, is that amongst my kisses, some have really really sucked, and some of the sucky kisses were from guys who were ""experienced.""  But most of the bad ones where when I or especially he was drunk.  So maybe try it sober with someone who is a better kisser, but if it comes down to it and you just don't like it, that's ok too."

psychicsword,AskReddit,1389585188.0,"I'm not sure about other schools in the US but this is what my school district did. 

K-5th grade you got roughly 30 minutes for lunch and 30 minutes for recess which is outside activities and running around break. 

6th grade to 8th grade is middle school  we lost recess and it gets replaced with more class time. 6th grade is the first time we got introduced to the idea of having multiple subjects each with their own teachers rather than 1 teacher teaching all subjects. Typically the classes are done in blocks that rotate so no class is always in the morning or afternoon. Starting in middle school you get homeroom which is probably similar to registration. At this point we had 30 minute lunches and the lunch time class was 1 hour because the other 2 grades were eating lunch. We started at about 8am and got out at about 3pm. If I remember correctly we had a single block that never rotated where we went back to our homerooms and took a break. 

9th grade to 12th grade is High School and we tend to gain study blocks which were the same length of time as a normal class as we still have the rotation. As a Junior(11th grade) or Senior(12th grade) we got ""free"" blocks instead of studies if you didn't get detention and if you didn't fail any classes(D+ or lower). When your free block landed during lunch you got the full hour and a half to eat instead of just 30 minutes. We started at about 7:15am and got out at about 2:30pm to allow for sports after school.

For reference you are about 5 when you enter Kindergarten and you graduate High School in 12th grade when you are probably around 18. "

Firstly, **Temeraire** by Naomi Novik is the Napoleonic Wars with dragons. It takes place at the end of the time period you have specified, but takes the historical research very seriously and goes into detail about how to use dragons as part of an army of that period. It also has major influences from the morals of that time with discussions about slavery and nationalism coming up occasionally.

**The Chronicles of Kydan** by **Simon Brown** is set in a time similar to the late 18th century. It has muskets and the start of heavy industry while everything is still mostly done by human hand. It has colonialism and technology as major driving forces in the book. It also has one of the strangest professions for a protaginist (whitesmith, or a person who makes small functional metal items like cutlery).

And lastly **Rings of Lightning** by **Jane S. Fancher** has a similar time period to it, but it is an entirely created world where that main source of power is not steam or waterwheels, but magical generators that tap into leylines and convert that to usable power.

[](/sp)

At this point I don't even remember what I did back on the first day since I was honestly more preoccupied with matters outside of the game (it was New Year's and I had a guest over so I didn't bother reading through the entire thread, I'm guessing).

This is also my first time playing and the scale has been a bit intimidating considering that there are, what, over 100 people? If I *had* been in the mafia I'm guessing there are more experienced players giving out advice there on how to vote and such and I've had no help in that regard. All I have to go on are what other people are posting in these threads and I have no idea of who's actually trustworthy.

Also, when I checked the nomination/execution threads on the second and third days it was the day after they were posted and by that time the votes were set and nothing I do would affect the outcome. As I've mentioned in the Plounge I'm more of a lurker so I saw little point in tossing a simple ""me too"" vote by that point. Of course I then realized that it seemed suspicious for me to not contribute at all either, trying to fly under the radar, so I tried to contribute more on day four but again have very little to go on aside from bandwagoning with other apparent town members like the masons.

[](/ppshrug) So if my voting habits seem suspicious, it's really a combination of other factors. I'll admit it's a rather weak defense, but if you lynch me you just get another dead vanilla townie instead of a mafia member, just saying."

I worked at a funeral home (a place not known for its sweet-smelling aromas, that is, unless you like the scent of Clorox, formaldehyde and gardenia arrangements), I had just finished mortuary school. Anyway, I worked for a small family-owned place that had several female directors and only one male director, the guy was kind of a jerk and liked to throw his ""senority"" around and also lived with one of the guys who did removals, so they were thick as theives. One morning, I got to work feeling pretty good about things and I look on my desk to find a (wrapped) bar of soap and a photocopies page out of the dictionary that had the definition for ""hygiene"" highlighted.
I just stared at it until I burst into tears and ran into the bathroom. One of my friends came in and asked what was going on and I told her, and then asked if this was some kind of cruel way to tell me something. She said she had no idea and nobody had complained before. I was barely able to function for days until I got word it was a delightful prank played on me by the two guys who worked there. I've never been able to get over it, and just thinking about it makes me want to cry.

I, frankly, am fine with whatever she chooses, but what's important to me is that *she* chooses (and I'm sure you feel the same about your son). The thing with people of faith is that, if you tell them you lack it, it becomes their mission to save your soul, so if you tell them you want to keep your son away from their faith, it'll just make them *more* determined to indoctrinate him.  
  
I just avoid. I hope my daughter is exposed to many faiths, so they can take care of exposing her to the Christian stuff. Going to church once in a while won't hurt--I went to church activities, either Christian or Mormon, many times growing up and it didn't affect my ability to reason because my mother taught me how.

It was actually turned into good plot point, that the value of humans was that they could think of solutions that the perspective of a 'smarter' but more rigid and dogmatic race's preconceptions would blind them from; humans seeing the tech for the first time in isolation _could_ see the nose right in front of their faces.

So color me shocked when in self parody Voyager did the same thing by beaming a torpedo onto the borg ship _then never did it again_.

capughe,atheism,1389588507.0,"1. Trying to keep this short: one by one my reasons for believing there was a god disappeared.

* Personal miracles? Anecdotal evidence that can usually be explained away with more reasonable causes (e.g. medicine cured my little brother's cancer; the bus happened to be slightly later than I was because well it snowed a little).

* The Bible? There are so many contradictions on basic 'facts' for lack of a better word (for example, when was Jesus born, why did Joseph go to Bethlehem, and who saw Jesus when he rose before he went to heaven?) as well as really confusing contradictions of God and Jesus's characters: loving and forgiving? just? bloodthirsty? Also, there are books that are not included in the Bible, called pure myth. Who decides whether scripture is real and inspired by God?

* The complexity of creation? Well evolution really made sense when I started to read a little about it instead of just assert it was wrong; and filling in what we currently don't understand with ""well God did it"" (i.e. God of the Gaps) really *didn't* make sense.

 * I came to see that the universe didn't need a god to explain how we got here or how it works; we are uncovering those mysteries through observation, experimentation and reasoning.

* I got a lot from the God Delusion, but if you're afraid of Dawkins being a little mean to you, then I wouldn't recommend it as a *first* read.

* I honestly wanted God to be real. I prayed and consulted strong Christians in my life (who basically told me to pray and read the Bible). I wanted Christianity to be a reasonable belief system. When I stopped believing, I felt as if I had lost a friend.

2. I'm not sure, I stopped my searching at the ""is there a god"" part when that came up ""probably not"". I'd say it's likely that there was a man but that the stories about him are confused and exaggerated. The reports we have of him make him seem bipolar at best.

3. No. I have a problem with some misogynistic and homophobic aspects of Christianity that most Christians tend to ignore anyway. I have a problem with using your religion to decide what other people can do (e.g. anti-abortion laws). I have a problem with inaccurate science education/telling outright convoluted lies to justify your religious views (e.g. creation museums and some of my old Christian science text books). But otherwise everyone not in the Westboro Baptist Church is generally an okay person as far as people go."

I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's way too broad of a subject, and there's a lot unknown about depression.  What you suffer from and the causes behind it might not necessarily be the same as me, nor the person who posted the original thread.  I just don't think it's right to brush off something just because it's outside of a personal worldview.  It would be different if it was quantitative, but hopefully we can agree that depression does not work like that.  (We're human, not automatons, otherwise it would be an easy fix and no one would suffer from depression).

As far as the post goes, I think perception has a lot to do with some of the negativity.  I don't necessarily think many of the posts written by men misogynistic with intent, rather, they come off that way.  It's similar though in my opinion how women might not view their heightest statements in regards to dateable men as rude.  It's really hard to see our own faults due to bias blindness.  But obviously there is some underlying issue that involves heightism, particularly with men, otherwise there would be far fewer negative posts.  As for the depression aspect, remember, for many people, this isn't just a one time thing.  Maybe it's not a person's stature directly, rather, the impact of societal acceptance.  We're talking about entire lives, day after day, with perceived lack of respect, and it can eat away at people. "

Be sure to get some good gear too. DOT/ECE full face helmet plus an armored textile jacket (minimum, leather is better), leather gloves, and over the angle boots.

South Korea, Japan, the  Phillipines, Taiwan, they're all legitimately scared of North Korea to varying degrees.  In shooting war any of them could suffer significant casualties, notably South Korea and Japan could be easily looking at hundreds of thousands to millions of casualties. 

In the long run, the truth is that basically anyone is a threat to everyone else.  10 years ago we were talking about the risk of North Korea getting a nuclear weapon, now they have nuclear weapons it's a matter of weaponization and motivation, and you never really know how crazy the next guy is.  10 years from now we could easily be talking about which parts  of the united states are well within range of DPRK missiles (right now the answer is.... probably  hawaii, maybe but not likely the  west coast).  


&gt;their military is a joke,

The  US just lost wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to far smaller, less well armed and far less fanatical enemies.  The DPRK is odd because it is after all a political not religious cult, and they could turn on a dime to our side if the right guy ends up in charge, or they could flatten half of south korea before we realize that our armies are completely unsuited to trying to do  anything useful in North Korea.  

The last decent estimate I saw was a US general before congress, he put reasonable estimates for the number of troops allied forces could put into the DPRK at less that 200k ( I think he said 160K  but I'm not sure, the way I crunched the numbers  myself I came up with something in the 140-200k range, there are basically only two roads into the DRPK and both of them would be blocked).  There aren't roads or ports that would do much good, and most of the paths in are through mountains in the south, China in the north.  They're  really quite isolated, and they have a 2-3 million person regular army without another 6 million or so reserves.  Sort of like Japan in WW2 - on a tactical level Japanese soldiers were outfighting american ones ~4:1, but because of island hopping the US was  able to take them in small pieces at  a time, so you'd have 20k US soldiers against 20 waves or lines of 1k per wave/line, Japanese and the US would win, but it would be bloodbath to do so.  

The US army is great at planting and waving flags.  Not so great at holding down a territory full of people trying to resist and occupation. 

&gt;about 20 million or more

The DPRK only has 23 million people.  Most of whom  are not in a position to walk to China. 

&gt;We've threatened war with Iran because they MIGHT be able to produce warheads in the near future.   Yet we basically ignore north Korea even though they have the capability and the willingness to use WMDs.

In part because all of the pressure we applied to the DPRK didn't work, and in part because we basically ran out of pressure to apply to the DPRK.  Iran is much much much more connected to the rest  of the world than the DPRK.  You can buy samsung mobile phones in Tehran, you can travel there  as a tourist fairly easily, there are  Iranians all over the world, in schools and in businesses.   Even when you can't buy oil from Iran you can still buy agricultural products, but they are still selling that oil to lots of places.  Iran has a lot more to lose than the DPRK - the DRPK has been isolated from the world basically from the beginning, Iran is trying to be a regional power broker with allies in  various parts of the arab world, as well as trade relations with their various neighbours, the straights of Hormuz are also a major trade area so they have influence.  That doesn't mean anything we try on Iran will work, but they do have elections (perhaps not fully free and open elections but more free and more open than north Korean ones), they have trade with the world etc.

keypuncher,Conservatives_R_Us,1389590500.0,"&gt; Are illegals better at finding work in a foreign country than US citizens are in their own home country?

Yes - in the places they choose to work in.  Employers know that illegals will work for lower wages than Americans even where the wages are legal - and will work hard, and are unlikely to leave for a better job.

&gt; All I know is that I've never had a problem finding a job, if I was willing to work hard, listen, and learn (usually more work than I needed).

Not everyone has it so easy.  It can be particularly hard if you have been out of work for a while and are applying for jobs well below your skillset.  Employers are usually reluctant to hire someone they think will bolt the moment something better comes along.

&gt; If you can't find a job here, than you would be unemployed in any other country on the planet.

True - I think it is mostly that people aren't willing to make the required sacrifices.  If you own a home, it is hard to just walk away and let the bank have it because the only job you can find is two states away, doesn't pay enough for you to pay the mortgage and rent somewhere, and you can't sell it for more than the mortgage or rent it out."

nullomore,AskFeminists,1389590633.0,"&gt; how can we claim to live in such a society when women participate heavily in politics and social organization?

I think the confusion here is about degree. Patriarchy is a comment on dominance, but dominance comes in degrees. Women can participate in politics, and it would still be consistent to say that men dominate politics (ie political patriarchy) if women don't have a roughly equal voice/equal respect/whatever. Patriarchy is a shorthand way of saying that men generally have more power and freedom overall. It's not claiming that men have all the power in every situation. Hence, even if women make up 50% of our congresspeople, this may or may not be a patriarchy because we haven't considered how they're treated, how they're perceived, how young girls are taught to think about themselves as viable political leaders or not, etc. Let's say we have this world where, for this one particular election, feminist voters got really mad and and every single one of them voted and so a lot of women got into office. If the majority of the rest of society still thinks women should keep their mouths shut and raise babies, that's a toxic environment dominated by male-dominant thought, or in other words, patriarchy.

I think there will probably become a point where it's not clear if we're in a patriarchy any more. As things improve, we may get to a point where men dominate in some situations, women dominate in others, and overall, it's roughly equal. In that situation, we'll probably have to renegotiate our ideas about equality all over again to see if it's worthwhile to try to make equality in every situation or just be happy with being roughly overall equal. But, that point is not now. Yes, there are some areas where women dominate. But the overall balance of power and the overall societal attitude is not roughly equal.

I hope that makes it more clear. I don't dispute your claim that lots of women participate in politics and social organization - it's clearly true in many areas of Western society. My claim about the existence of patriarchy is just a claim that we're not that close to true 50-50 equality yet. There's a lot of structure in place to try to make it 50-50, like laws saying you can't pay women less for the same job, laws against discrimination, etc, so it's a lot better than not having those laws at all. Plus, women can get educated and live mostly as they choose, so it's pretty good in that respect too. But the part where things aren't 50-50 in Western society is the cultural part. People still tend to have negative attitudes about gender, and they influence our choices so that we're not exactly choosing freely yet. Like /u/Joywalking said above, men are free to wear dresses in every way except for the enormous cultural pressure not to.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389590916.0,"&gt;It seems like it would require a lot of math. Does it?

Yes.

I'm writing my doctoral thesis in comp sci on game development and balance is a big part of it.

I can't tell you specifically what Firaxis does, but to some degree things can be a lot of math, which are well suited to ELI5  because well, the math depends on your combat model and that is game specific.

But there are a lot of fairly profound design and philosophical choices.  Should a phalanx unit be able to defend against a  tank?  With what probability?  Math lets you tweak parameters to make whatever you want happen, but ultimately what the math should do is a design choice. 

When it comes to more orthogonal  choices  - like the faction bonuses, where one guy gets bonus money and another guy gets bonus diplomatic relations well, they aren't really balanced in any purely theoretical math sense.  It's not really realistic to try and weight 1 unit of money versus diplo reputation. The idea is to basically run the game a LOT, AI on AI, player on player,  AI on player and figure out the probabilities of  winning and losing.  In a game like Civ where a lot  of the game is AI factions against AI  factions you can do a lot of balance by just automating the game and seeing how it goes, and keep going until a large enough sample sets gives you close to  equal probabilities for each faction. 

Enter into the discussion:  Starcraft.  Starcraft is an esport rather than just a single player game.  In this case your tolerances on advantages  to a given faction are much lower than they are for something like Civ (or the other  extreme, Skyrim, where you can kill the  last boss with about 3 hits if you are so inclined).  

Balance really works in multiple layers - units against units, collections of units from an era against other collections from an era (say early game/late game, or 'ages' in Civ), overall strategies that may encompass multiple eras against each other, and then all of the indirect (non military) systems balances  against each other. 

Oh, and in Civ thinks are heavily biased by starting location and conditions, this is deliberate - in SC you're trying to give everyone an equal chance, in a historical game  you're trying to give a realistic starting condition.  In civ the randomness is part of what makes the fun of the game, and optimizing around random conditions, so each game is different.  


Edit:  One thing to add.  Sometimes  good balance is about thinking outside the immediate set of equations around your combat and say ' lets add reload delay to this weapon, shrink the clip size, or to change how the scope works' or the like and you get away from bullet damage and rates of fire as big overarching math concepts and change how players can actually use the tools given to them.
