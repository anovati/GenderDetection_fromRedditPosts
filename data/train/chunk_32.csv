DreadfulRauw,PoliticalDiscussion,1390252907.0,"&gt; main culture artifacts. celebrating the fourth of july. belief in the bill of rights(this is a big one most everyone in this country has massive faith in the bill of rights), thanksgiving, common experiences (high school and the like), learning to drive, getting a job, going to prom, paying taxes, voteing, and even christmas ( the santa variety not the religious variety), music, cuisine, history ( there is some controversy about this) cultures are built on common experiences and beliefs.

*facepalm*  So Christian Americans with lower middle to upper incomes?  Jesus, you're ethnocentric.  You're saying that the Indian families in my neighborhood aren't  part of the main culture because they don't celebrate Christmas, even the Santa kind?  Or that Korean families that eat primarily korean cuisine in America aren't part of the culture?  It seems like you're just uncomfortable with people different than you.  That kind of bullshit is exactly what they're fighting against.  

If you're white, you have white privilege.  That doesn't mean you want it, or you did anything to earn it, but you still get to live in America on easy mode.  Remember the housing discrimination we were talking about?  how much of that do you think is against white people?

&gt;I can't become a black person, or a latina, or taller. therefore they are not groups worth belonging to.

Physical appearance is only 1 part. Confidence, composure, interests, lifestyle, mannerisms, etc/etc/etc. They all play a part. Everyone's different. 

The man I fell for and married is a tall, slim guy. Probably average level 'attractive' if you were to ask a random group of women, maybe even a little below depending on preferences. I think he's sexy. Confident and jokingly cocky, but really a nice guy who gets along with everyone. He's kind of a dork, and I can't go a week without hearing something about a table top game he wants to play (DnD). He made me watch every season of Buffy with him. On the other hand, he's active and was in gymnastics long enough to be impressive. Ironically, he's the clumsiest person I know on flat ground or stairs. He word-vomits with excitement when we first get with friends, and says ridiculous things without really thinking about it. Sometimes it's embarrassing, lol. Doesn't care a thing for politics/etc, to my frustration. Loves animals, which helps because I work in that field. Was a natural on a horse the first time I put him on a saddle, but can't get near a farm bird without getting flogged. Etc. 

My point is that none of this is particularly overwhelmingly amazing... but all of it together makes a portion of my husband, and all of it was part of my falling for him. *shrug. 

And none of it was ""first sight"". When I first met him, I thought he was sort of scrawny and an asshole. It was a wrong first impression and mostly circumstantial, but that's kind of my point. "

Smaller unit groups were what I was starting to go for, because of AoE magic and especially because of the introduction of artillery. This would render lines of riflemen kind of obsolete before they got ready, so that could be another way swords could still be viable.

Spellcasting is already rare-ish. About 10% of the population is adept at magic, and out of those 10%, 1% get training. 

Mass education does happen in the more civilized parts of the world. In my Holy-Roman-Empire-likeness, there is an education system of universities and elementary education units. Most higher education happens through Arcane Universities (expensive and geared towards magic rather than education) or through Royal Universities, which are in the more advanced parts of the world.

Liberalism has affected the world a lot. Capitalism is a definite thing in the world, and to some extent, Communism is just getting in there as well (one of my realms is actually just a democratic collection of communes). Both elven nations became pure Republics, and there are a couple other republics as well. All but one of the monarchies have a constitution and a parliament/congress.

n88888888,WritingPrompts,1390253041.0,"A really different take. As soon as a read the prompt, I thought of a simplistic rocket ship shaped as a needle, trailing a red thread through the universe in preparation to stitch it up. If I end up drawing it, I'll post if if there is any interest.

Teddy was ready. 
His helmet was tightly screwed into the hem of his spacesuit, visor pulled down over his dark eyes. He felt like he had a fishbowl over his head and was a little disoriented at how the world looked and sounded between layer upon layer of space protection gear. The gloves seemed a little big, but this kind of protective gear always felt awkward before you got used to it. He bent down on the tarmac to tighten his boot; the knot in the lace had come loose somewhere between the space station to the rockets launch pad. Before he had taken off his glove, his commander stopped him.



“Teddy, don’t take off your gloves! You’ve got a space-safe seal, you can’t break it until you get back to Earth!” Shaking her head, Alice stooped to tie Teddy’s boot. 


“There, now you’re still safe, and your boots are tied properly! I’ll clip your laces so that won’t happen again.” Alice pulled two bobby-pins from her pale blonde hair to stick into Teddy’s boots. Tucking the remainder of the laces into the boots, Alice patted Teddy off and reminded him of his mission.


“We’d better get you into the Universe. The tear isn’t going to fix itself! That’s why the world has heroes like you, Teddy.”



Teddy walked arm and arm with Alice to the launch-pad. It was twice as big as Teddy, looming its sturdy stature above him. Teddy wondered how many tons of cardboard and egg-carton foam had gone into building it. What humans could do astonished him. Then again, he was a Teddy, which made it difficult to do anything without getting glue and pencil shavings matted into his paws! He would leave the technical work to Alice, his best friend, but could offer his services as something much easier and less specialized- like an astronaut!



“Ladies and Gentlemen, Barbies and Kens, Play-Doh and Legos,” Alice began, as Teddy bravely faced the bustling crowd, “Today, Teddy will go where no Teddy has gone before! To the Universe!” The crowd gasped, applauded and cheered. Alice continued:



“As you know, the world has been too windy. Why? Because we litter too much. We have too much litter! If more of you would use littler to make rockets and launch-pads, then we wouldn’t have this problem! But that is okay, we can start making more of our things out of recyclables. I’ll get mommy to save them. But we still have a tear in the Universe! A spaceship carrying garbage crashed into the Universe wall and tore it up!”



The crowd hissed, Alice extended her arms to calm them, “Ladies and Gentlemen! Teddy will be going to space to fix this problem. He will ride the great spaceship we have made into space, and then the Universe, to sew up the wall! Ladies and Gentlemen, lets hear it for Teddy!”


Teddy stood and waved to the crowd. He turned to Alice.



“Alice, I love you, I’ll be back for juice and snacks.” He hugged Alice, then entered the ship. Alice pulled an elastic band around Teddy and tucked his paws into the craft. 


“I love you too, Teddy.” She kissed his cheek through the helmet. He blushed, but you couldn’t see it through his dark brown fur. She nodded to Teddy, and began countdown.


“Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven...”


Teddy wriggled in his seat. He was ready to go into the Universe!


“Six... Five...”


His forehead was sweating under the helmet. Boy, astronauts had to wear a lot of safety gear! It was baking under all those layers!


“Four... Three...”


The engines began rumbling, and the ship shook. Teddy looked behind him. All of the crowd looked on in support. They had their hands up in the air, and many of them had flags with Teddy on them. The souvenir stand must have made a killing!


“Two... One...”


This was it! Fire shot out of the engine. Teddy held himself tight in preparation for the launch. In just a few seconds, he’d be in space! Then, in a few seconds more, the end of the Universe!


“BLAST-OFF!”


Teddy was violently thrown back from the force of gravity. His eyes were wide as he watched Alice's bedroom turn into space. Planets flew past him as he entered a mobile hung over Alice’s window. The ceiling was full of stars. To the Universe!


The rocket hurled itself downstairs. After rounding the hallway to the living room, Teddy had arrived. The Universe was beautiful. It had giant planets shaped like a couch and two recliners. Teddy spotted the tear, and the fabric it was on. It was big and blue and square. Teddy aimed the rocket and radioed Alice.


“Hello Alice, this is Teddy. Can you hear me?” Teddy pushed the buttons on the dashboard to call Alice. He was nearing the rip, and waiting for further commands.


“Teddy?” Alice’s soft voice came through from Earth, “Hello Teddy, please get ready to stitch the Universe back together!”

Teddy was aimed for the target. A needle with a long, strong red thread stood at the tip of the rocket, ready to puncture the Universe walls. Over the radio came another voice:


“Teddy, are you sure we should sew the blue Universe with red thread? It may look a little funny to the folks back on Earth!” Alice’s mommy, April, suggested.


“Yes, mom, so that when we look up from Earth, we remember Teddy’s bravery and also that we have to be nice to our Earth, space, and the Universe!” Alice whispered into her radio. Teddy agreed, not in commemoration of his bravery, but because his favorite person, Alice, had suggested it.


Alice sat with Teddy and her mommy as she helped to sew up the Universe. Teddy concentrated on his job, piecing together the big tear until Alice’s favorite blanket was fixed and the Universe had been saved.


“Would you like some cookies? I think Teddy would. He had quite the adventure.”


Alice radioed Teddy, “Teddy, would you like some cookies?”


Teddy put a gigantic oven mitten on the dashboard and called back, “Yes! But I have to come back to Earth first, your mom will need these gloves to get the cookies out of the oven.” He released the button, took one more look at the Universe, and turned the ship.


As Teddy turned, he felt gravity begin to pull him away from the now famous Red Teddy Constellation and back to Alice’s home. Faster and faster, the rocket plummeted towards space, then Earth. Then, before he knew it, Teddy was back home and out of his space gear, snuggled under a special blue blanket with a twinkle of red stitching running through the centre. A plastic cookie sat on his lap, and a sparkle twinkled in his eye. Alice rushed in to hugged Teddy, congratulating him on his journey, before running into the kitchen with his space gloves.  "

PaleBlueNew,AskFeminists,1390253350.0,"""I shall briefly introduce some of the works concerning the Quebec feminist translations, which sparked much debate within the academic translation community.

The first article worth mentioning is Luise von Flotow’s 1991 paper Feminist Translation: Contexts, Practices and Theories. Written post-Quebec, this article examines the contexts in which the practice of overtly feminist translations began, detailing strategies used to translate in a feminist style, such as supplementing, prefacing and footnoting, and hijacking (Flotow 1991: 74-79). This article provides a full introduction to the need for the feminist translators in Quebec to “attack, deconstruct, or simply bypass the conventional language they perceived as inherently misogynist” (ibid.: 72). Using examples of Barbara Godard’s and Susanne de Lotbinière-Harwood’s feminist translations of Nicole Brossard’s works, Flotow asserts that the work  these translators is “at the root of this phenomenon,” (ibid.) of the feminist translation strategies now in practice.""

 
""Godard was central to the Quebec movement, writing several papers on the topics of feminist theory, literature and translation, advocating the use of invasive, radical translation strategies to give women a voice, notably in her 1989 article Theorizing Feminist Discourse/Translation (p.44). ""

""Arrojo’s 1994 paper Fidelity and the Gendered Translation was written in reaction to the radical translations of the Quebec feminists, exploring these works within the context of the traditional translational concept of fidelity. Arrojo denounces the perceived “castration” (Arrojo 1994: 154) of texts as they are translated in this radical feminist style,  her concerns that they are “hypocritical,” as “hijacking” should surely be considered as “violent” as patriarchal translations (ibid.: 154, 157).""

That's as much as I can find that is about French writing, and not too deep on the translation theory."

igacek,depression,1390253474.0,"I have thought about a shared house, but I'm apprehensive. I don't know why. Maybe I have the presumption that it's going to be a terrible experience, and since I work from home and take mainly online classes, that I'll become a burden since I'm always around. Maybe I'm over-thinking it though. Also, since I would love to move away and start fresh for my last two years of school, it may be a pain for other housemates if I move in then out within 6 months.

I'm definitely not happy living where I am right now, which is why I am worried that I may be depressed. The moment I walk into my home and sit at my desk, I think ""wow, this is really shitty. The same place, living above my parents... what the hell am I doing with my life?"". Unless I'm maybe coming home with a friend or a girl, it's usually a negative atmosphere.

I would love to say why it scares me, since I am seeking help here, but I don't really know *what* scares me. I'm thinking I'm scared of committment, yet I am thinking a void of committment in my life (girlfriend, housing situation, etc) may be contributing to my sadness. I may be scared of moving somewhere and hating it, but I'm trying to tell myself that I won't know until I actually give it a try - it may be the best thing I've ever done.

Maybe I'm just scared because I feel like I am paving my own path in my life without any leadership to help me. My father hasn't really been a prominent figure in my latter years of life (teenage to now), and I guess I'm scared of making the wrong decision. I don't have a loving dad that's here to say ""Yes, that's a great decision, you should do it"" or anything like that. I realize that I only live once, and I'm scared of completely fucking that up. Is that a valid reason, or am I overthinking it?

I have 2 years until I finish my degree - I'll have my AA in May if everything goes right, then I'll have my bachelors in ~2 years afterwards. I hope.

cptn_garlock,anime,1390253475.0,"&gt; Ok, I had to wipe tears out of my eyes after that whole memory sequence, and they crept up on me, didn't notice them coming. There's no one moment I can point at as especially emotional, aside from his mother crying when she departed. Maybe I'm just turning into a big sap.

Normally, I often wonder about you getting so emotional during certain scenes, but this scene was one where I also had to fight back tears too. 

I had to catch myself from painting the revolutionaries as the automatic evil, when obviously it's *supposed* to be a complex issue - Kal-El may have had his family slaughtered and many died (probably innocents) in the process, but the revolution may have brought in many beneficial changes compared to the old regime. Here's hoping they manage to weave in more of the larger historical impact into Kal-El's personal revenge plot. 

Also, calling it now, Claire is related to that Frontier Duke and he's going to have to reconcile loving the daughter of the man who sorta killed his parents. Here's hoping we get a happy ending (I don't think my heart could take anything else.)

Punishment based methods can easily lead to fearful, anxious, and aggressive behavior. It is absolutely OK for a rescue or shelter organization to not adopt to someone who is going to throw a shock collar on their dog as ""training"" and then alpha roll it. That dog could very likely come back as a bite quarantine and euthanasia request - there is no reason not to hold out for a home that is going to use humane, dog-friendly training methods. There is absolutely no reason to use punishment, especially harsh punishment, in dog training.

Also, the option is not ""dead or in a home that uses inhumane methods."" There are plenty of good, quality, homes to go around. There are more people looking to bring dogs and cats into their households than there are animals in shelters. 

Absolutely people are allowed to work and have dogs. But if you are going to leave a dog unsupervised alone for 12 hours straight every single day, when exactly are you going to be taking them for walks, training them, exercising them, and socializing them? Now if they come in and say they have a great plan such as... the neighbors all take turns watching each-others dogs because they have opposite schedules, they are going to do doggy daycare, or they will hire a dog walker... great! But I certainly would not give someone a dog that had no plan and was going to leave the dog alone for more than nine hours straight on a regular basis.

And no, I never said that liking ""tough"" breeds is bad. But there are always red flags that go up when I have someone come in who expresses an interest in nothing  but tough dogs but has no understanding of them and no interest in learning about proper training and socialization methods. If I get the impression you want nothing but a dog to be a status symbol and don't have a good understanding of breed types, training, exercise, and socialization requirements, and really just want to look at all of our Pit Bulls and Rottweilers and aren't interested in the dogs that actually fit your lifestyle, you aren't getting one of my dogs."

First, I just can't stand Armitage Codebusting.  It's a total of +4 credits over seven clicks, counting the install click.  I know that there's a lot of love out there for it, but I've just never cared for the math.  Compare it to Daily Casts, which is a total of +4 credits over one click.

The Account Siphon/Lawyer Up combo is brutal and effective, but I'm not seeing an effective way to put them together.  That's a problem.  From experience, Lawyer Up without a tag is pretty awful.  Any time you have one, though, it's awesome.

Your Ice looks excellent.

I'm not sure what Parasite's doing here.  It's a solid card, but it works best with a little more support than you're running.  Trashing ice is great, but you're already going to be really tight on memory with your core three breakers, Knight, and keyhole, Djinn notwithstanding.

Honestly, what I'd like to see here is Professional Contacts, but its inclusion would mean that you have to reduce or remove the Lawyer Siphon combo.  It shores up your drawing issue and gives you a nice, steady trickle economy.  Even dropping one of each of the two is enough for two Professional, and I think that's a smart move.  Daily Casts and/or Kati are similarly solid economy backup singers in such an event.

Overall, I like it.  I think you could run this with Reina just as well, if you wanted, but I also think that's a matter of personal preference."

Kmart in particular tends to be a real honeypot for these types of deals. 

Speaking of which, I love late-gen titles because they tend to utilize their hardware really well and provide some of the best experiences on the platform.

y^(2)(ux - 1) + x^(2)(uy) = 0.

Make a change of variable to v(x,y) with the conditions that vx = ux - 1 and vy = uy. The equation now becomes

y^(2) vx + x^(2) vy = 0.

Assume that v(x,y) = X(x)Y(y). Then your PDE now becomes (after rearranging)

X' / [x^(2) X] = - Y' / [y^(2) Y] = λ

The condition λ = constant must be imposed, as it's the only way a function of x is equal to a function of y. These differential equations are manageable. Solve them and you'll find

* X(x) = exp(λx^(3)/3)
* Y(y) = exp(-λy^(3)/3)

Or v(x,y) = Aexp[λ/3 (x^(3) - y^(3))] + C, where A and C are some arbitrary constant to be determined by boundary conditions.

Now to recover u(x,y). To do this, notice that 

ux = vx + 1.

Direct integration with respect to x tells us

u(x,y) = v(x,y) + x + Y(y), where Y is some arbitrary function of y.

Now impose the condition that 

uy = vy = vy + Y'(y). This tells us that Y'(y) = 0, or Y(y) = B = constant.

So our solution is u(x,y) = Aexp[λ/3 (x^(3) - y^(3))] + x + C, where I lumped the constant B into the constant C."

It also brings up the question of translation ethics: how much are you denying the original author's message to the reader by interventionist strategies?

I am inclined to somewhat agree with those comments. Although I think interventionist strategies can be interesting and useful, it depends on the target reader, and the text subject. I don't condemn it entirely, but nor do I condone it for general widespread use. It is a highly politicised area of translation debate."

When you hit cap, there's tons of post game content to make your character even better but it's pretty grindy. And then PvP at cap is absolutely worthless to do unless your gear score is at least 10K.

The biggest pay to win element is the mount system. To be truly competative in PvP you need a 110% speed boost mount. They can be bought in the store for a pretty penny, I don't remember the exact price off hand but they are pretty pricey. That said, I PvP without a 110 mount and I do absolutely fine. Many times, if you control your movement correctly, the other player's speed won't matter at all.

scottious,musictheory,1390254202.0,"&gt; It basically says to find the key, then you can make a 1-3-5 triad at each note in the scale.

What you just described is basic diatonic harmony.  It's just a simple framework for understanding chord progressions.  Many many songs do use the this simple formula and will simply use I-IV-V-vi chords.  It's a formula that works, for sure.

&gt; But that can't be it! With all the different ways to change chords, when can you play them??

There are tons of ways to branch out from diatonic harmony.  Secondary dominants, borrowed chords, key changes, modal harmony... Don't get discouraged by it all right away, start by internalizing simple diatonic harmony as much as you can and find songs that fit it.  Make note of songs that venture out and use chords that don't ""fit"" diatonic harmony.

&gt; And there are so many songs where the chord progression itself is a melody!

This is an issue of chord voicing (the number and order of the notes used).  Good choice in chord voicings can kind of 'embed' the melody into the chords.

&gt; I feel like I barely ever hear music that follows such a simple explanation of chord progressions?

There are actually lots and lots of songs that follow simple diatonic harmony.  Just a few off the top of my head:  Wagon Wheel by Darius Rucker, Let it Be by The Beatles, Closing Time by Semisonic, Don't Stop Believing by Journey, Knockin' on Heaven's Door by Bob Dylan, Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen

I don't remember every single chord to these songs but they do follow very simple chord progressions and will rarely venture out if at all."

You're not bad. With a little more vocal understanding, you'll improve a lot. Try cupping one hand around the outside of one ear lobe, like the shape of a ""C"". You'll be able to hear yourself better. Use deep breaths (from your diaphragm without raising your shoulders) train yourself to breathe at the end of a phrase. It helps to point up with your index finger when you're singing the high notes. You're a little flat. Do not force vibrato to sound like someone else. Just let it flow. When you sing, try to breathe and sing from the back of your mouth with warm air. Forward creates a nasal sound.

This is one thing you must do: DON'T BE AN ASSHAT.

Read extensively on playing an evil character. Nobody is allowed to be chaotic evil. Please be neutral or lawful evil. Chaotic evil is just a reason to kill everything, and you will end up doing just that.

Being evil doesn't mean you can't have friends. No inter-party conflict of any kind. No stealing and no killing other players.

Try to focus on being cunning and witty rather than being ""hurr durr ima stab the barman"". Being evil doesn't mean you're stupid - you may lie, cheat and steal, but only a fool just walks around killing people. The evil should lie in the motives, not in simple wanton destruction. Think Ponzi scheme: No killing anyone, just stealing all their money. All the decent bad guys are complex, and have an actual goal other than ""kill everyone"". Try and work towards money, power and control.

That being said, sometimes evil characters can be the easiest to play.

It's all about ability, really. The chanting from the crowd makes for a much bigger microphone for racism and abuse.

Especially when you're still pretty young! She probably thinks everyone is having a great time and that what she is doing should not be embarrassing, and while it may be warranted, it can be really upsetting to be told ""you are embarrassing me in public.""

I would have a conversation with her during a calm, SOBER, moment. Say ""Hey honey, I want to let you know I love when we go out and usually have a great time, but *I* am not a fan of PDA and *I* get uncomfortable when you are so affectionate in public when we have been drinking. Is it possible that you could express your affection in a different way such as hand holding, a smooch on the cheek, (or whatever you ARE comfortable with) and save the making out for when we get back home?"" 

Make it about YOU and YOUR feelings, and not that what she is doing wrong. Don't tell her it's embarrassing, just tell her you don't like it. Don't point out that other people think it's gross either, that's just unnecessary and is going to hurt her feelings even more.

&gt;Who is denying that? It's the internet of course it exists. 

You're missing my point. She's denying it, to a degree. She wouldn't be allowed to post pornography, so there is some implicit rule that this is a gamer stream for game content, not a sex stream.

&gt;The question is why is sexualized content ""attention whoring"" in any way that various non-sexual streaming activities such intentionally acting like an idiot/over the top aren't or if they aren't all view whoring to the best of their capabilities. 

They're all about attention, and there's nothing inherently wrong with whatever you decide to use to increase views, on it's own. It's the selling of content with manipulation that I think bothers people, in this particular situation.

&gt;is it really her behavior that is evil or is it her success that is evil?)

It's not ""evil"", I'm just trying to give an explanation other than ""marginalizing the non-conformist"" for why someone might not value a particular method of garnering views in a game-centered stream, and that this could be valid. 

&gt;She provides shallow gaming content, just like pewdiepie and various other streamers/youtubers who have a stick. Obviously there's a market for shallow gaming content. 

Shallow is relative. Porn would be no content, and Day9 would be pretty much only content on this site. It would actually be the opposite on a porn channel. There's room for interpretation in between what is expected and what you get here.

&gt;To me complaining about her is like complaining that pop stars who are bad singers and don't write their own music get succcessfull. Sure that sucks, but that's how the world works. 

Ah, here is where you're too cynical. The world doesn't just ""work that way"", someone made it that way, in large part by strategizing around human biological weakness to make money. It's important to speak out when you see that, not just tacitly accept the manipulation.

&gt;Hanging out in her stream and insulting her is like paying money for T-Pain concert tickets, driving there only to yell that autotune is bad. 

I don't advocate this behavior, just think we should ask whether the criticism is valid. It might be, given the context of the stream.

&gt;Yeah, Lady Gaga and Madonna are pretty bad singers, but aren't the people who rage about them existing even more annoying? 

Not if they have a good argument against their practice.

&gt;How would I look if I complained that I don't get as many upvotes as some /r/gonewild chick? 

I guess it depends on what grounds you object. You'd have to defend yourself well.

&gt;When in reality, is that you must just wait and hope...

You can wait and hope while the rest of us try to actively better our society.

&gt;The ability to not care about things that are not actually important is a surpringly useful skill in real life. 

I get it, you don't care. Other people do, and this is a discussion about why.

&gt;Ever noticed how male guys who are conventionally attractive (like Ghostrobo or even pewdiepiew) are much more likely to do facecam compared to guys who look more dumpy? 

Nope. I don't watch gamer streams. I am more interested in looking at the power shifts when using manipulative methods to sell a product. I'm ok if sex is the product, or even if sexualized content is the product, which may be the case here, or not. That's worth arguing. What I'm saying is that whatever she did, she may have stepped across a line that begins to separate the sex from the content (as you said, it was a content-light stream). I think this is part of the reason some people objected to the stream.

* Minority kids adopted by white families

* White kids adopted by white families

* Minority kids remaining with their own families (actually not part of the study, but compared with the study's data)

and find that the first group and the third are lower than the second, that that must be biology?

Like holy fuck, you don't think there are other factors at play there?

Let's start by quoting the study's authors themfuckingselves:

&gt; It is essential to note, however, that the groups also differed significantly (p &lt; .05) in their placement histories and natural mother's education. Children with two black parents were significantly older at adoption, had been in the adoptive home a shorter time, and had experienced a greater number of preadoption placements.

Then let's consider things like

* the treatment of black kids in schools vs. the treatment of white kids in schools

* the treatment of kids adopted by parents of a different race/ethnicity

    * by their adoptive parents

    * by others

All your study says is ""Yeah, black kids tend to do worse than white kids whether they're adopted by white families at some point in their lives or not""."

blueskin,sysadmin,1390256157.0,"You have the following options:

Work up through the helldesk: Easy to moderate difficulty, will cause you to hate everyone. Needs a decent sized company who promote internally and preferably provide training. Always be on the look out for things you can learn and go, get training/certs if you can, but always be working on your own projects to gain the experience you need as well.

Self-taught: Moderate difficulty. You should be doing this *anyway*, but going 100% selftaught means you need demonstrable experience. Pick your platform (Linux, MS) and specialities (networking, virtualisation (VMWare? KVM?), hardware, etc), and learn it well. Make a project list, and be ready to list your accomplishments. You'll probably still only land a low end job, but it lets you skip the helldesk.

Certs: Moderate to hard difficulty. Get certs via an educational institution and use them. You should still gain practical hands-on experience too, but the certs are a nice boost. This might land you either a helldesk or sysadmin job depending on the certs, the company, how you interview, experience level, etc.

Myself, I went self-taught and started out in a sysadmin/support combination job, also did networking and hardware and learned quite a bit; was made redundant after about 9 months and moved on to another more sysadmin-focused one with less support work but no real skill gain, then a year after that, a proper full sysadmin one."

Zaiton,WritingPrompts,1390256163.0,"Sarah Parker walked down the pier holding her daughter’s sweaty hand with a firm grip. She would not let Erica fall between the boats and ruin her beautiful dress. She glanced ahead and noticed that the dockworker was already waiting to take them out of the harbor, to the yacht.  She looked forward to a bit of shade, a drink and a quiet day at sea with her family and friends.

  
‘The big boat is boring. I want to stay at home with my friends”, muttered Elisa.


‘Honey, we’ve been over this. You won’t be alone today, I swear. Mary is waiting for you on the yacht”, she replied.


‘Mary isn’t my friend. All she does is talk about boys and she doesn’t even dare to swim in the water’, she continued. 


‘Maybe you could learn a thing or two from her about being a fine lady? Now, take Juan’s hand and get in the boat’, she said, hoping to put an end to the discussion.


Sarah followed, took his hand and sat down, wiping off the sweat on the seat. Juan moved to the wheel, ignited the engine, put it in reverse and backed out of the pier. Elisa seemed too preoccupied with spotting the occasional seal to continue nagging her. The boat sped forward at a brisk pace and in the horizon she glanced a black dot growing bigger and bigger with every wave they broke. Suddenly, the engine cut to a stop and Sarah grew impatient. She rose from her seat, took a few quick steps to the front of the boat with a sarcastic comment in mind. 


Elisa exclaimed, ‘Look at the shadow in the water! It’s coming towards us!’


She wasn’t lying. Sarah rushed to the side, grasped her daughter’s hand and studied the shape, trying to figure out which animal it could be. When the shadow was ten meters away, the boat shook violently from the other side. Sarah fell into the water, Elisa’s hand still tightly locked in her's, and as she panicked to pull herself up, the shadow silently slided under her feet.

n88888888,WritingPrompts,1390256800.0,"I had arrived fashionably late for the party, as I had been told to do. In my position, I didn’t want to arrive early to find myself cornered into a budding conversation I couldn’t contribute to. A much safer option was arriving after conversations had been established, then joining in as a listener. I would nod between sips on my slender, delicate flute, filling my mouth whenever someone looked keen on asking my opinion. If they ever did ask, amid my awkward gulps, I would fake a choke, cough into my handkerchief, and excuse myself. Much less embarrassing than opening my mouth and allowing whatever idiocy I had thought I had caught from the gossip to spray onto the guests like a sneeze. I hadn’t a clue what had happened up until this party. I shouldn’t have even came.


I made my way into the room. Ah, the champaign! This was step one. I nodded to the server, plucking a flute from his tray like a rose from the bush. I hovered the glass under my nose, picking up the smell of the sweet bubbly. I cleared my throat, holding the glass an arms-length away; I hadn’t remembered that I wasn’t a fan of champaign. I floated throughout the groups of guests to find the punch. At the back of the room, an unaccompanied table stood, draped with fine linen, holding the most glorious bowl of fruit punch. I turned to the crowd, checking for eyes. No one could care less about me abandoning my champaign; as I slipped my glass behind a vase, I overheard what people were interested in. 


“I heard he’s a German spy.” 


*A German spy? Who?* I ladled punch as I turned my head to eavesdrop. 


“Nonsense, he wants us to think that!” a man violently gestured with a glass in his hand. Wine sloshed onto the carpet, ignored by the group of gossipers. “He is actually related to Kaiser, and I know, because someone close to him brought that little detail to my attention.”  


I took a sip of my punch. Much better than the bitter bite of champaign, though a little sweet. “Kaiser,” I thought, approaching the sandwiches, “like the bun?” I held the sandwich up to examine it, making myself look occupied as I took in the conversation.


“I’ve heard he...” the voice trailed off as I quietly observed paintings, the wallpaper, light fixtures and hors d’oeuvres. I still had my kaiser bun sandwich and punch. I waltzed over as eyes fixated upon me.


“My bet is on Kaiser, as well.” I nodded at the gentlemen with the wine. I lifted my sandwich, took a bite, and continued with the conversation. I had found my in. Who were we talking about, anyways?


The conversation quickly dwindled upon my entry. The man who had suggested Kaiser hastily laughed at my comment, then excused himself to grab another glass of red. The people dispersed and I was left alone with my snacks. I decided to meet the Kaiser-theorist at the bar. 


“Good evening, sir.” I approached him as he swirled his glass. At first, I thought he may be drunk enough to chat with a stranger; turns out he spills more than he drinks, and swirls his glass because it’s the thing to do. I tucked in the white ruffles on my collar as he gestured towards me with his damned glass. 


“You think it’s Kaiser too, eh?” I took a great big bite, covered my mouth with my hand, nodding and chewing frivolously. I gestured towards him with my bun in hopes that he’d continue the conversation. 


“Yes, I too believe it. Someone important told me. You know, not many believe that. I’ve heard so many crazy rumors. He’s a spy from Germany, he’s a bootlegger, he’s of Oxford, and so on! I’ve even heard he was the one who found the safe in his basement but never delivered to us news of what was inside! Torture! But I doubt that was him. A relative of Kaiser wouldn’t bother wasting his time with vaults. Besides, Jay Gatsby isn’t the type.”


Ah! Gatsby! The Great Gatsby! We were talking about the host of the party. Isn’t that against some type of party-goers pledge? I continued to chew as the man swirled his wine and went on about his theories. Gatsby. Yes, I knew some of that man. He looked strikingly similar to Leonardo DiCaprio, but I believe Jay had received an Oscar back in the day. Quite a man he was, or so I had heard. I nodded and asked questions when there was a pause, but ultimately spent the rest of the conversation piecing together what I knew about Gatsby. Wasn’t that the name of the book that doesn’t use any ‘E’s in it? No, that’s something else, ‘the’ and ‘great’ each have an ‘E’, and he’s The Great Gatsby! It was fun to say. 


I interrupted, “Well, I must be off, it’s been quite the evening.”


The man looked puzzled, “Already!? You come late and leave early, perhaps you’re odder than Gatsby himself!” He handed the bartender his empty glass for a top up, unaware the floor under his barstool was crimson and boozy, then made his way to the kaiser buns.


I nodded to people on my way out. They pleasantly smiled and went about their conversations. As I pulled my arm into my jacket, I overheard an interesting conversation:


“Yes, I spoke to him, odd fellow.” It was the man with the wine. “But he believes the Kaiser theory!”


“Don’t be such a fool!” A woman retorted, “He doesn’t believe in the Kaiser theory! He didn’t even know who we were gossiping about until you mentioned Gatsby’s name at the bar.” 


“You don’t think? He hadn’t a clue?”


“None, he was merely eavesdropping on a prompt he wasn’t prepared for!” A few people chuckle as the woman continues, “In fact, I’d go as far as to say he doesn’t even know much of who Gatsby is!”


Hand in the air from struggling with my thick wool sweater, I hear my name called. 


“Yes, Nathaniel?”

“My hand wasn’t up, sorry.”


The teacher scoffed, continuing the torture, “That’s okay, I’m still calling upon you.”


I put my arm down on my desk, frowning. “What was the question?”


I hear the students sitting in the row behind me giggle. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a girl lean over to her friend and whisper,

predalienmack,TheWalkingDeadGame,1390257099.0,"This is why I acknowledged the detail that most people would potentially be making different decisions based on conclusions made on a subconscious level. I think that the amount of people who are consciously prejudiced enough to say to themselves ""oh, my character is black, time to go on a murder spree because being black makes it more 'ok'"" are a very, very small minority. On the other hand, literally every single human being has subconscious prejudices that are very difficult to become self aware of. 

Have you ever done one of those flash picture studies in psychology (best way I can describe them) where they'll flash images of people (usually of two races, or men and women of the same race, depending on what factor they're studying, it could be a variety of things) where they'll have multiple phases where you're asked you to say, press a key when a positive word like ""happy"" pops up, then press a key again when picture of a white man pops up? The idea is to do it as quickly as possible without ""thinking"" about it, but while you still give yourself the time absorb the important details of what just popped up on screen. Then, they'll have a second phase with the same or similar positive terms, but you have to press the key when the face of a black man pops up. They continue to do the same thing with negative terms, terms associated with crime, etc. What these studies have concluded is that a majority of people of all races (at least where these studies have been done, mostly in the US) are more likely to have strong positive associations (based on how quick your responses are and how accurate you are based on the criteria of each phase) with white people in comparison to black people and often strong negative associations (especially terms associated with crime) with black people, which psychologists and sociologists believe to be due to a variety of factors in society, not the least of which is how a strong portion of black characters are portrayed in the media. Just food for thought. If you want me to find one of these studies (they're pretty much always going on), I can provide a link to one if it is asked for. 

Another thing to consider when people make choices in any sort of game with player choice being a factor is what kind of role playing that they do. To me, there are two major types of role playing: one where you say to yourself ""what would Lee do in this situation"" and the other where you say ""what would I do in Lee's shoes."" The first one would likely cause more overt, conscious prejudices to come into play as you would want to factor in everything you know about Lee into what decisions you make with him (which would result in a variety of things based on who the person role playing is), while the latter (which I suspect is the type of role playing most people do) would be more susceptible to the more subconscious prejudices I've lightly explained above. 

All that being said, I'll just say that I really liked Lee as a character not because of any thing as superficial as his race (which doesn't really matter in my eyes) but because he was a relatable and well developed character, even with the fact that he was a murderer going to prison before the world went to shit. Telltale did a great job with making some interesting and relatable characters with all sorts of backgrounds in their first season of TWD. TWD is also a universe where hypothetically these various prejudices and aspects of discrimination basically disappear entirely in the face of the apocalypse, while new ones or old ones that weren't very strong (ageism comes to mind) come in with a vengeance. It's all very interesting to consider."

The_White_Baron,learnmath,1390257178.0,"It depends on your learning style, the course, the textbook, and so many other things. In general, I don't take notes unless 1) the textbook sucks and 2) the instructor's notes are wonderful. Even then, I tend not to read the notes. After a while, I said screw it and stopped taking notes in general. I don't read them anyway.

My personal opinion? Reading the textbooks isn't *that* important. To clarify: I find jumping right to the problems best. When I get stuck, which I almost always do, I consult the examples in the textbook. If I can't follow the steps, then I read the earlier passages on derivations. 

So, basically, I only read the text if I'm lost. I've found the words are there to 1) sketch why the formula provided is valid and 2) show how it is used. Sometimes, when you already understand how to solve problems and can do it at will, going back and reading the derivations in your textbook can be fruitful.

For example, I've been a TA for a year now on basic calculus and algebraic physics. When I read the textbooks now, I get to skim most of the paragraphs since I know what a lot says, but when I look at some derivations, I have deeper insight and can appreciate the pedagogy. It also gives me a few ideas on how to present the material to other students.  I've found that sometimes I develop a certain frame of mind in solving problems--a frame of mind that's particularly disorganized (I do guess and check by nature). When I see more rigor in the textbooks after I've mastered problem solving, it adds some organization to my frame of mind and polishes my problem solving skills.

That's just me though. Don't try to do what I do and expect success--we're not the same person, and your learning style likely differs from mine. But if there's one thing that you *must* do, it's solve problems, whether you read the text or not.

tl;dr: reading the text is always fruitful, but not always necessary for proficiency."

Gives you the drivers cellular number.  Drivers are almost always pretty nice guys.  It's a win.

Obviously you'll need a car for your road trip portion.  Try Kayak.com or priceline.com for car rental deals.  

Air BnB is also superior to a hotel usually, not least because you have a kitchen, which saves you money on meals.  

There's a GREAT app called ""hotel tonight"".  Which gives insane last-minute deals on empty hotel rooms.

psychicsword,changemyview,1390258360.0,"&gt;   totally agree with this, hold people accountable for the guns they own, to make sure they are stored safely and the owners restrict access to them. For some reason, I don't think the NRA will get on board with this.

That is actually what the [NRA safety courses teach](http://www.nrainstructors.org/CourseCatalog.aspx). They also encourage every gun owner to take their classes. If you made a law that built in their basic gun safety 101 class into the safety class at very little cost then they would probably agree with it. The part they don't like is when suddenly the government bumps up the cost as a way of pricing out gun ownership. The NRA would love nothing more than more safe and responsible gun owners because that would almost guarantee the 2A will never go away and that is ultimately their long game. 

Honestly gun ownership is far easier to learn to the point that little 14 year old me picked it up really easily when I first shot at Boy Scout camp. It isn't like a car where there are extremely complicated rules. [Gun ownership is as simple](http://training.nra.org/nra-gun-safety-rules.aspx) as storing it at least trigger locked and unloaded, cleaning it properly, unloading it when not being used(making sure there isn't a bullet in the chamber), never getting close to pulling the trigger unless you are about to shoot something, and never point the gun at something you don't want to shoot. As long as you follow all of those then it is almost impossible to get in trouble. While yes I learned this easily because I had shot a few times before there were people in my class that have never considered owning or had touched a gun before. For a single $100 3-4 hour class they got hands on training that taught them all of that and it included live fire training. Kids could easily learn the principles in a single day."

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1390258468.0,"&gt;The Bible does strongly support segregation (Ezra 9-10).

First, interracial marriage and segregation aren't the same.  Second, Ezra is using the exact terminology of the Torah talking about it, which is expressly about religion.  Third, Ezra applies it only to priests.  Fourth, Ezra connects it explicitly to religious practices in multiple places.  Fifth, it's Ezra saying it, not God, unlike in Numbers where it's God who punishes the condemnation of interracial marriage.  Lastly, I've never seen anyone actually cite Ezra in that discussion--all the historical texts I've seen talk cite only the Torah and maybe the narrative-prophet books (Joshua-Judges-Samuel-Kings).

&gt;""Allowing slavery"", mandating punishment for disobedience, and conversely using apostolicity to command obedience, obviously supports slavery and, though it doesn't forbid it, doesn't give much room for abolition, especially on the part of the oppressed person.

Perhaps...as you can guess from the flair, Paul is outside my area of knowledge.  But while it would make things like slave revolts bad, you could still campaign against it, buy slaves for the purpose of freeing them, etc.

&gt;And, yes, use of what the Bible says about women does apply. Obviously it isn't going to use the word ""vote."" That wasn't a thing! It has implications for roles within society.

It might be relevant, but the argument she quotes just asserts without anything behind it.  And even the quotes you would mention (Paul's thing about women speaking in church) are pretty different from voting."

I think that element is exactly what makes room for character development. While other series spend time going ""oh hey, what's this?"", DS9 gets a chance to flesh out an established area, with specific characters. Both premises have their merits; one gets to explore a wider range of moral questions, while the other gets to push deeper into the principles of specific characters. I think it all comes down to personal preference, but I definitely lean towards DS9.

(and, of course, both premises can move into the character/moral aspects of the other premise, but I'm talking about the *primary* concern, which tends to focus on one or the other)

AKA_Sotof,europe,1390258661.0,"&gt;For someone who is blinded to the racial aspect, I cannot think of a suitable analogy to represent the vulgarity of it all - the closest I can think of is that, dependant on which country you live, it would be deemed offensive to market Love Hearts[1] with sexist/homophobic quotations on, or sell genitalia-resembling/""pornographic"" candy in clear view of children (not a good example to give to a Dane, as Scandinavians are, admirably, very liberal about sex); it's about as overt and ""out there"" as those examples, and clearly, if either of those suggested examples had occured in most countries, there would be moral panic and public outrage.

This is just dumb. They did not write ""Black people are evil"" all over the candy. It's just a stupid stereotype. It does in no way relate to the religious and cultural persecution aimed towards certain sexual orientations. There is absolutely no reason why they cannot make candy according to a silly stereotype except for you hyper-sensitive people getting your panties in a twist over it."

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1390258883.0,"&gt;It's evident to you NOW, with all the clarity that hindsight and history afford. For most people, something is ""clear"" primarily because their pastor and their religious culture have told them so, not because they have thought through the issues vigorously themselves.

See my replies elsewhere.  While that's sometimes true, some of those arguments are bad no matter the era.  It doesn't take hindsight to know that arguments that use bad logic or are factually incorrect are bad.  See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1voc93/the_bible_was_clear/ceug9x3)--I referenced both good and bad arguments for and against a particular issue.  No matter what the opinion in 100 years is, at least one of those arguments will be both right in hindsight but also bad.

&gt;Oh brother. The issue is not about voting, the issue is about whether women have a right to be formally educated, work in the public sphere alongside men and have the same rights and privileges as males. The Church and her leadership maintained the opposite for nearly 2,000 years and used New Testament passages to ""prove it"". There are VAST segments of the Church today that still use those NT verses to keep women in line. Clear to some/still not clear to MANY.

Sure, but whoever that was in the article had long been around for women being educated, but was against women voting.  And while you could make a good biblical argument against it (and only be wrong in hindsight), simply asserting 'this isn't biblical womanhood' isn't it.

&gt;A modern example: How many times have you heard someone say ""The Bible CLEARLY says that being sexual and/or having sex with someone before marriage is a sin"" It is repeated over and over from pulpits all over the world, every single day. And yet, there are actually no verses that explicitly say that. Clear or not so clear?

I don't think it's clear.  As with most things, some scriptural arguments against it are good, some are bad.  The same is true with the other side."

What little it does add (multi monitor stuff and UEFI) are miniscule portions of the market.

It probably won't be super-noticeable, but if you think something like that might bother you, you can cut the row out after you finished the increases, and re-knit the entire decrease section from the bottom up.

I have bpd. I only just got diagnosed last week. I have had a lot of relationship issues.  I sabotaged a lot of good relationships and never knew why. Now I do. 

Ive been with my husband going on 7 years, married 3 1/2. We are very happy. What has worked for me is ive learned what is more important for me than communication is to SHUT THE FUCK UP. Go in another room. Calm the fuck down. Get your thoughts together. And when you dont feel irrational, communicate. Because it is most important that *you* are communicating, not your bpd. Because your bpd will say things that you dont mean. Dont let it. 

So now, while you are calm, make a game plan. One of you get upset? Leave the room. Have a phrase that is code for ""im ok. Dont follow me. Im just calming down so I dont blow up on you."" Like ""im going to check my makeup"" (even if im not wearing makeup... just means ""im checking my feelings to see if what im feeling is legit or not"")

Ive found this has cut down on the drama in my marriage. And thankfully my husband is understanding and just waits until im calmed down and ready to talk about it."

Renner1,syriancivilwar,1390258997.0,"&gt; Its not always the American's responsibility to send their young men and women to die fighting in some other country for people that don't even want them

Maybe the Americans would be wise to stop acting as though they're some paragon of justice and liberation or a nation that the world ought to revolve around-- a nation that gets to decide what's what.

I mean, the primary reason the Iraqis ended up seeing the American presence in Iraq as less then a good thing is because the Americans screwed up on a massive level. Not the American narrative of ""we graciously liberated the Iraqis, and they were unfair and childish and ungrateful that we took the time to improve their lives"".

I think that America has an obligation to the Iraqi people especially now-- and it's hilarious to see Frankenstein in Washington tell the Iraqis that Anbar and ISIS is ""their own problem"" after the Iraqis said ""why not co-operate on destroying ISIS""-- but America was, in my mind, obligated to the Iraqi people ever since they started meddling in the country to begin with.

Same thing goes for Afghanistan, although they really shouldn't have lost interest after the Soviets left, or at least put their support behind Massoud in the 1990s.

&gt; Assad would do something crazy and retaliate by attacking Israel with chemical weapons.

I can't see how it's that hard to find them-- the sort of people who are actively going to Syria to engage in ""jihadist activities"" aren't exactly quiet about their worldview and their personal convictions.

It's going to be harder with the likes of Abbott and his pals in the Australia-Israel Friendship Committee trying to ""lead the way"", but realistically you'd look for people who express sympathy towards Salafi Jihadism or takfirism. You look for the people who talk about a global Salafi Islamist caliphate or who think that ISIS and Al Nusra have the right idea.

I really don't think people like this are at all thick on the ground-- collective estimates from many different countries are going on about only ""a few thousand"" people in total who are ideologically motivated enough to actually travel to Syria and fight for extremist groups."

None of us in the games business are all that thrilled with the idea of a windows store.  Windows was great in the sense that whatever you think of the OS, no one had to pay to make software for it, you don't pay MS a tax per copy of whatever sold or the like.  And you could have whatever hardware people could make.

Moving away from that would be disastrous for the industry, there's no way Activision or Valve or EA want to be paying Microsoft money for every game they sell, and Apple is no better.  So... linux is the hedge against microsoft being successful. 

The only thing worse than MS being successful with a windows store would be Apple being in charge.   Linux fragmentation is a serious problem, but then, making your own distro solves some of that.

Jedi Knight - KOTOR 3, if you go LS like I did, you'll be a stereotypical big hero who saves the world from everything. IMO it was a bit cliche but if it's your thing, then go for it.


Jedi Consular - Focuses on the diplomacy aspect of the Jedi, can be a bit slow at times but I didn't think it was as terrible as everyone else makes it out to be. It was my least favorite of the pub stories, but it wasn't bad. I went all LS only because most of the DS decisions didn't really make sense in terms of the story and your character's position.

Trooper - Not super fast paced, but I felt that it was a decent story overall. I would make each LS/DS decision that makes sense given each situation, which is how I did it. I ended up being almost completely neutral (something like -3600/4400). As a bonus, all of your companions are troopers, so you can use them as coat-hangars for off-specs (I'm a vanguard tank, and Aric holds my DPS set, which makes him awesome to run dailies with).

Smuggler - The most amusing story on the pub side with lots of one liners, I played all DS. While your companions won't love you for it, many of the DS decisions involve taking bribes, which appeal to most of your companions. "

K2TheM,motorcycles,1390260285.0,"Track days are a blast and something every motorcycle rider should do at least once. Obviously a sport bike is more suited to this than others, but pretty much anything that will pass tech can be allowed through depending on the hosting organization. I've seen goldwings, harleys, old 250cc bikes, you name it and it can probably be taken to a track day.

As far as what's local and good, you'll have to hit up a local motorcycle forum. 

Buying a used race/track bike can be both a plus and a minus. On the plus side it's more likely to have everything set up for track work. No lights, minimal gauges, safety wired bolts, etc. The downside is that the mechanicals could be wrung out and tired. Poor engine performance worn out parts etc. If you are just looking for a track only weapon (not intended for a specific racing class), find the cheapest best running salvage title bike you can and go from there. 

You'll also need track specific gear. If you are just doing track days, a two piece suit will be fine; if you are looking to race, a single piece + back protector is mandatory for most. Also, you'll need gauntlet style leather gloves, and over the ankle boots that have no gaps between the boot and the suit/pant leg.

All told from scratch you can get into track specific riding for between 5-10K depending on what you end up getting. Be aware that maintenance costs are going to be higher than normal. Tires, brakes, oil, all get swapped out with regularity, along with chains and sprockets. "

Or a simple question like, are you considering expanding your lab and taking more students and would you please love me and admit me?

* Post-bath I cover him with Aveeno Eczema Care lotion and let him run around naked for 10 minutes  
* At bedtime I cover him again with extra virgin coconut oil before dressing him in full sleeved jammies 
* Then I give him a dose of Benadryl if he's still red or itchy  

He went from being absolutely covered with eczema ([pictures](http://imgur.com/hLpGAJt) [here](http://imgur.com/tB6nXPN)), scratching himself til he bled on a regular basis, and utterly miserable, to smooth comfortable skin in about 2 weeks with this routine.

Michael heard the yell coming from outside his room. He had woken up early to attend a lecture and found himself demotivated from studying after returning to the apartment. Curious at the shouting, he threw off his headphones without turning off the music and walked out into the hallway.


“Hey Kim, what are you looking for?”, he asked, with a hint of a smile.


“My fucking keys. Have you seen them?” she replied, in an annoyed tone.


“Oh? Is it last week already?” he chuckled. 


“It’s not funny! If I’m late for work again I’m going to get fired.”


Michael walked around the apartment and haphazardly looked around for her keys. In reality, he couldn’t care less if she found her keys. Perhaps getting fired would teach her to start keeping track of her stuff. Anything happening that would make his life a bit easier was a welcome change, and sometimes she would hate him for it. His parents had taught him to remember where his keys were and he would happily do the same for her, if she’d just let him.


“You’re not even looking”, she remarked.


“You have an eye for detail”, he retorted.


“Don’t you realize that the only thing that matters to me in this world right now is finding my keys? Please, can’t I just borrow yours for this time?”


“Nuh-uh. I may want to go outside later and I won’t let your messy ways ruin my day.”


Michael sighed, walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge. He grabbed a coke from one of the shelves, poured it into a glass along with some ice and sat down by the table of the little kitchen. From the corner of his eye, he noticed a small metallic pile of keys attached to a silver ring resting in one of the corners. He pricked his ears, listened carefully and heard that she had gone back to rummaging in her room, convinced that there was some place she had forgotten to search.
He rose, grabbed the pile of keys and studied them for a moment. Afterwards, he slid the keyring into his pocket and walked out of the kitchen into the living room. Michael took one last glance towards her door, walked into his room and closed the door. "

There is a decent care sheet for them--you should be able to keep them ok until you can get them to someone who can care for them properly. Warmth, humidity, fresh water are all they really need for the next week or two. 

Since they are hungry and probably cold, it's *very* important that you separate them. They will be competing for warmth and food and since those are probably in short supply, one or both will decide to eliminate the competition.

It took quite a bit of effort the first few times I did it too. In your bathroom, put your leg up on something, and then squat down. I usually wet it first with *warm* water (cold will make your claim tense up) and then get into this position. Being in the squatting position you're in, it should open you up quite a bit. Get the tip in and just push it further back. I don't worry too much about it opening up right away, tbh. If it doesn't open immediately, I do a few weird things with my legs, squat a couple more times, and even then if it doesn't open I just let it be and eventually you'll feel it pop into place. Won't lie, it's not very comfortable (actually can be sort of painful) but it's very, very brief discomfort.

&gt; these forces were the ones that eventually manifested into sentient creatures, before the physical and spiritual world even existed.

Then one might expect the positions to become filled once again, as more cosmic matter bubbles up into sapience. Or not?

I think your explanation of it is still good, and I think you have a pretty good concept of these fundamental forces. So my challenge to you would be to really give them some flavor. Light/dark chaos/order conflicts are really, really overdone. You could keep things the way they are, but I think you would be better served by creating these things are individual concepts instead of calling them light and dark. The direction I'd point you is the Dao, yin and yang, which have analogues in light and darkness, chaos and order, but they're subtle and eclipse these things.

The reason I suggest this is because it's way too easy - like I initially did - to assume your light/dark was the Wheel of Time / World of Warcraft / D&amp;D / etc. light/dark. The way you're making it sound, there's much more to it than that, that light and dark, in the human sense, are really defined with reference to these universal forces."

What they'll probably do is either take the SKU off the receipt or find a matching dress in-store to match it with a number. I wouldn't recommend telling them straight up that you wore it, but they probably won't give you a hard time if you admit it. I just wouldn't offer up the information unless asked. Bring whatever you have. Worst case, even with no tags/receipt, they'll say they can't return it and you move on."

I've never used a Bamboo personally, until I got my Intuos I was using cheapo Trust tablets but I'll never go back. the surface is amazing to draw on, feels more like paper. The pen is much more sensitive and responsive and comes with interchangeable nibs for different ""feels"" to the pen, it has tilt-sensitivity as well as pressure sensitivity and probably more that I've forgotten about. It comes in like 4 different sizes with varying prices, too. I have an ""M"" size (for about £220) and it's about A4 ish if a little smaller and perfect for the sort of work I do.

I know I'm not Teuts but that's my two cents. :)

EDIT: It also has controls on the tablet for things like scroll wheels and the like if you're into that kinda thing. Not something on it i've ever used not by accident though. Like the bamboo it can be made wireless and for an added price you can get touch controls on it, too."

Sure, you won't look like Ryan Gosling over night, but you'll stand out from the other 99 people that *didn't* groom themselves.

Now add to that working out(hell, you don't have to get fucking ripped, just a lean look is fine for most people) and getting some clothes that actually fit(instead of some baggy shit two sizes too big or something that cuts off your blood vessels two sizes too small) and look good, and you'll be in the top 20% of men.

They're great characters and all, but there are countless others who could do a great job carrying episodes and rarely get to. I'd love to see more episodes focusing on characters like Chief Wiggum, Dr. Hibbert and Reverend Lovejoy. Hell, even Flanders and Krusty rarely get episodes anymore, and theirs are usually among the best! 

If episodes centered around a wider variety of characters, I think that'd really help alleviate the concerns people have about its repetitive nature. We wouldn't have to see as many ""Homer and Marge marriage problems"" or ""new guy at the power plant"" stories. "

shafonfa,TwoXChromosomes,1390263512.0,"I just had a baby a few months ago. My recovery was a bit rough and we had issues establishing breastfeeding, so for me, the best visits were short and sweet... Or nonexistent, to be honest. I was so tired, and was being woken at all hours of the day and night to feed the baby, or for them to draw blood or run tests on one (or both) of us. That's just me though, maybe she will be glad to have visitors! Just be very careful not to overstay your welcome.

Offers to bring food are nice. Also, you could offer to pick up anything she may have forgotten... A toothbrush, socks, little things like that.

What I found most helpful was when people visited after I was home... and brought dinner. That was THE BEST. Hospital visits for me were not enjoyable. But once we were home and had to fend for ourselves, I really, really appreciated when friends brought dinner for us!!

Last thing-- don't go if you even THINK you might be sick. Better to postpone the visit than risk putting a newborn back in the hospital! "

ObscenePenguin,howtonotgiveafuck,1390263538.0,"Not giving a fuck isn't really about not giving a fuck, it's about appropriate and effective fuck allocation.

Appropriate and effective fuck allocation can be difficult. **It requires introspection and honesty but not self flagellation.** I will repeat, for effect, **not self flagellation**.

You say you are still doing your masters in engineering and aviation (allocate your fuck here), but don't yet have a job in that field (reserve your fucks for this bit when your degree is complete). Most people do not find work in their field while they are still doing their degree. Most people's jobs during their degree include things like pulling pints and delivering pizzas.

Right now you're in unpaid work. The experience will be worth more than the money, so try not to give a fuck about that. If they're not giving you anything to do, don't just sit on your laurels waiting for something to land in your inbox- give a fuck and get out there! **Proactivity is key**. Chat, make friends, ask if there's something you can do to help, make yourself a useful and valued part of the team. It's called networking and it's a life skill. Learn it.
 
You're not a loser. You are starting out. That shit takes time. Deal with it. 

Apply for every aviation engineering post you find. Do it nationally and internationally. Even if you have no desire to work in a place, the interview experience will be good for you and you can always turn it down if you really don't want it. Don't give a fuck about wasting their time, I assure you they don't give a fuck about wasting yours.

Next thing- get off facebook, because it's becoming a source of unhappiness in your life that you can do something about. OP I am now putting you on a facebook ban. No facebook for you. Study instead. Do not focus on where your classmates are, focus on how they got there. Ask them. Ask them for copies of the CVs. Ask them how their interviews went. They're a resource. 

Next you need to get off your arse and get your running shoes on. Set yourself achievable, realistic goals and make them happen. Couch to 5K is a good place to start and it will give you an immense sense of achievement. Getting out of the house, exercising and achieving your goals will boost your mood and sense of self worth.

Next, you need to stop seeing the world in terms of winning and losing, success and failure. The world is what it is. The only control you have is the ability to chose your response. Identify the things in your life that you want to change and then take steps to change them. If that step doesn't work out try something different.

Life pro tip: Success is getting what you want. Happiness is liking what you get. It's been my unfortunate experience to know that these things are profoundly different. 

There are no winners or losers in this game. We all end up dead, so fuck it.

AKA_Sotof,europe,1390264081.0,"&gt;Tell that to me, a good 50-100 years down the line, when discrimination against the likes of sexual orientation swings back and forth like a pendulum, just as racism has, and you see people testing the boundaries for that, with people justifying it just because it was done so in a subtle manner, and didn't have ""Gay people are evil"" written all over it.

It will swing back if you continue to make it a special thing. If it never reaches normality, then it will swing back with absolute certainty. If it reaches normality - it probably won't.

&gt;We live in an age where people will rightfully get all prissy at uneducated comments such as ""All gay people are camp"", or images of the stereotypical housewife of the early 20th century;

I wouldn't say you are right to get prissy at an image of a stereotypical housewife of the early 20th century. In fact I would say you are pretty stupid and wasting your time.

&gt;but, when it comes to race, we've gotten to this point where people can come out with the most absurdly racist stereotypes and, as long as certain key words aren't used, we just laugh it off. It's freaking disgusting, and I've never understood the logic behind how it's okay to discriminate against different minorities in different ways

Oh yeah. Totally. It's not like we've gotten censorship like a anti-racism bill made into law... Oh wait, we totallly have. I think many people are rather getting annoyed at morons calling them racists for criticing a culture. Culture you *can* change and should criticise - that has happened for generations. Making culture into this criticism-free zone is preposterous. Believe it or not, a culture of vengeance is not good. Believe or not people should probably assimilate enough to function in the society they live in. We should not turn our country upside down so they can colonise us. That's not how immigration works.

&gt; Ofcourse, your country hasn't exactly been a beacon of cultural sensitivity, itself, when it comes to matters of race and religion - it seems to take a laxer approach to such issues and, like the rest of Europe, has led to an opening for nationalist right-wing populism as a result. Don't get me wrong, I applaud your country's sense of equality in other areas but, like the rest of Europe, Denmark seems to be just as willing to sit back, or even support, whilst you have politicians rambling on about ethnic homogeneity, and how that would apparently solve every problem. Somewhere along the way you lost your Janteloven; and those Swedish Democrats have certainly lost their lagom (and their marbles, for that matter).

And that is a good thing, believe it or not. Not caring about your ""race""(actual races are poor fiction), your gender, your sexual orientation, etc. is what we should strive for. Because when it has reached a point where you don't care then it has reached normality and acceptance. I can laugh at a stupid stereotype because I *know* it is nos true - that is part of what makes it funny, the absurd nature. If you are suddenly offended by me laughing at it, you have a problem and I don't. I can find the horned viking depiction annoying without actually being offended - so long as people know it is not true, I won't care, but if you do I will educate you.

The Muhammed drawings are very different from this. They were drawn to agitate and provoke, and with good reason too. How can you not draw a picture of Muhammed? Because of their deluded religion? It's not real, so why should we care about it? Because they get up in arms and kill people over being oh-so-offended by a mere drawing? They're the ones at fault and they are ultimately responsible for the destruction they wreak - not the ones who make the drawings. The ones making the drawings are just pointing out to you have ludicrous and terrifying this kind of insanity is.

EDIT: Also just want to note that DF does not ramble about ethnic homogeneity. If they did then we may actually start to seriously call them Nazis. As for Janteloven, we never really lost that. It's probably one of the reason we're not so nurturing for those poor wobbly immigrants. They're not above us and they're not special either. If they want to come here they will have to live according to our laws and make an effort to integrate and assimilate. We'll help them with the latter two, but they won't get any kind of treatment a Dane won't get.

&gt;We live in this peculiar world where everyone is going to say ""Me? I'm not racist! That? That wasn't racist!"", whilst all sharing this common understanding (or common ignorance) that our actions and prejudices fit the definition. 

We all live in this world where people find racism where there is none more often than finding some where it is present. If you think any ""race"" needs special care or privilege, you are the racist.

&gt;No-one is willing to say ""I am a racist"" because it's socially unacceptable, but until people can admit it, the problem f racism won't be dealt with. This is a manifestation of that, and trust me when I say that this problem is only going to get worse before it gets better.

A lot of racists certainly do that, and a lot more people simply don't give a damn about race do the same. We want to get to the point where ""race"" is a silly and stupid concept to make fun of due to its absurdity. After all, what does skin colour have to do with anything?"

I wanna know stuff about a girl before I decide whether or not I'd like to commit to a relationship with her. Studies have shown that the higher a woman's number is the more likely she will cheat in a relationship. It all becomes a numbers game and I wanna know if I'm taking a big risk or a small risk.

Persona 4's story is incredible, there's a highly intriguing murder mystery that'll keep you guessing constantly and the party members interact with each so well and really feel like a close knit group of friends.

Nocturne is set in a world full of demons and you very rarely encounter humans. There's a complicated overarching story but little character interactions. All of your party members are demons who you optionally recruit so there's not really any interaction between party members. Gameplay wise, it is fantastic but the story is really sparsely told."

&gt;i really hope youre not serious about that last part....

I'm very serious about that last part, but I think there might have been a simple misunderstanding of what I've been trying to say. I'm not saying that all ""ugly"" people don't try, neither am I trying to say that everyone who's ugly is completely and 100% at fault for it themselves - I'm just saying that a lot of people who call themselves ugly don't seem to make an honest effort about changing themselves, and I admit, I derived that statement mostly from my own experiences. I have multiple friends who call themselves ugly, yet refuse to even *read up* about some basic dietary changes they could make. They refuse to go to a gym, or hell, go jogging somewhere at least. And they're very openly anti-fashion, and it feels like a lot of these sentiments come from a perceived unfairness in life regarding attractiveness of different people(Hell, I really hope this makes sense to you, if not, please tell me so I can rephrase it). And I've been in this very exact position myself. I've had long, nasty-looking hair, I refused to buy anything fashion/""mainstream"", I was proud about spending only the tiniest amounts possible in my clothes, for no real reason. And it made me look ugly. And I felt ugly. It made me anti-social because I was constantly worrying about how ugly I looked to other people.

I've started lurking /r/fitness in April, got my hair cut in September and started looking into /r/malefashionadvice about October. While I'm still not a model, I improved my looks significantly and start feeling more self-confident again.

I'm obviously biased in all of this, but I do honestly think that a lot of people out there are in a very similar position to mine."

Even attempting to go by skin color would result in issues because there are major differences, most people see a white person as a white person but with something like this you'd need to consider the differences between one from the Balkans and the Mediterranean so going by country is actually the most accurate (it's more likely to hold to genetic lines than general race, America is strange because it's mostly an extension of certain areas of Europe but still is a mixture)."

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1390265091.0,"&gt;I'm not quite sure what you mean by this.

The terminology Ezra uses is directly out of the Torah, where the prohibition is explicitly religious.  It's like if I talked about the freedom of speech, you'd assume I was talking about the First Amendment, since that's why my terminology is coming from.

&gt;As far as I can understand, he is applying to it all of Israel: ""The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands"" (9:1) and later ""Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take an oath that they would do as had been said"" (10:5) Note the inclusion of the general people alongside the specific mention of priests.

So at most, it's a prohibition for the Israelites only.  But the priests and Levites are consistently mentioned first, and special concern towards them is shown.

&gt;Weird, huh. I guess it was just the first one to come to mind. Poor Ezra doesn't get much time though :( Do you mean that it has less credence or something (i.e. not considered historical)?

I think he's kind of ignored because he's not narrative.  For Christians, he's not really relevant (kind of like Paul is for Jews)--he's establishing religious practices that Christians don't follow.  For Jews, the content in it is mirrored and vastly expanded on in later texts."

You say you are vegan, without an advanced degree, that you live in Detroit, and that you want a fulfilling job.

So get out of Detroit because it's a shithole, go out west where there are more vegans, and get a job on an organic farm because it doesn't require an education and because you will be working in an environmentally friendly position.

And as someone who has flown across the world to start a new life in a place I didn't know anyone, I know that doing so, while scary, can be a lot of fun and very rewarding.

NoStopImDone,AskReddit,1390266131.0,"While I do think that schools do not do a good job of teaching life skills to students, like doing taxes, managing a budget, etc., I am a believer that the standardized test system does work. It's a schools job to not only educate every student, but also to find the most promising young minds and nurture them. In that aspect, most schools don't have enough money to individualize testing and assessment. It's this that annoys me about people that preach about the unfairness of the education system; I constantly hear, as a student, of other students wishing that schools would test them in their specific talent. The fact of the matter is, however, that most schools simply can't do that. Instead, they opt for the system that has worked best: standardized tests. While the system may not be perfect it, and I'm making a broad generalization here, is pretty much tenets way of signaling which students show the most promise. Just my opinion, I believe I am entitled to it, just as you are entitled to yours. Anyway, The thing that I think is most wrong with today's education system is the fact that gifted students, at least in my school, get much less funding and attention than disabled and mentally challenged children. While I am defintelly for the ""no child left behind"" policy, I think it needs to be noted that the gifted students, who have a greater chance to be a future leader of the country than a disabled person, deserve to be nurtured at least at the same level as mentally challenged and disabled children. This may not be the case in your school, but as a gifted student who volunteers with disabled children frequently, that's my observation.

Your state's requirements will vary, and jumping in isn't always so easy. You may need to get a license (and some states require a master's degree as part of that) before you can get started. Private schools and some (not all) charter schools may allow you to circumvent that requirement, but usually the pay there is even less than in public schools. 

Since one if your major considerations seems to be financial, you'll also need to consider retirement implications. I teach in a private school, so I could be wrong, but my understanding is that public school teachers are considered public employees, so they don't qualify for SS upon retirement (though most have pensions). 

Also, it's not just a pay cut you'll be looking at. The vast majority of teachers leave school around 4 or 5 pm, only to attack a stack of grading after dinner. In addition to less pay, you're looking at a lot if unpaid work in the evenings, weekends, and summers. That is especially true in your first 3-5 years.

Daiteach,pokemon,1390266785.0,"I'm in my late twenties. I've been playing Pokemon since red and blue. X and Y are not only the best games since RBY, they're better than RBY. (RBY are not actually very good games at all compared to any of the others; they're classic, not high quality. They have the worst battle mechanics, and many features, both mechanical and quality-of-life didn't exist yet. They're probably the *worst* games in the series.)

That's not really unexpected, though. Pokemon games largely just (slowly) accumulate improvements over time, so it's not at all surprising that for the most part, every generation is better than the last. There's not really a single axis along which X and Y aren't clearly the best except for possibly the story, but ""best pokemon story"" is pretty much like ""tastiest laundry detergent"" - they're all beyond terrible, and if you're looking for something tasty, you shouldn't be anywhere near the product to begin with.

You could ask whether X and Y are the best games *for their time*, and that's not something I'd be comfortable saying ""definitely yes"" to, but they're up there. Like every other generation, there are some pain points, and over fifteen years since I've started playing, there are some BS issues that the series still persists with, and I'm pretty sick of them constantly withholding stuff from the first games of a generation so they can stick it in the third (or third and fourth, in the case of Gen V) games."

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1390267237.0,"&gt;What I am referring to is your stance on inter-racialism as a Jewish person (based on your tag) and the paradox that Israel seems to be a radically anti-interracial nation.

It isn't, though.  I don't think there's any reason to think that the level of racism is greater (vis a vis Africans--Palestinians are a different kettle of fish) than any European country.  After all, there is a large population of Ethiopian Jews in Israel.  While there definitely is racism against them, too, they're a normal part of Israeli society.  Without knowing either situation terribly well, I tend to think they're more integrated than North Africans in France.  Certainly I don't think there's any reason to call it a ""radically anti-interracial nation""--it just isn't.

&gt;One of the stronger points that white pride groups make is that Israel supporters (which I have no opinion of due to lack of personal knowledge) are constantly pro mixed societies until it comes to Israel, then they are “savagely” against it.

First, pro-Israel groups don't care about race so much--I haven't heard of any claim that Israel was wrong to admit Ethiopian Jews.  Second, I don't think that's accurate even if you look at ethnicity.  Israel has, despite some prejudice, equal rights for all its citizens.  It's fallacious to conflate the situation in the territories with society-wide.  I don't think any pro-Israel groups have spoken out against mixed-ethnicity cities existing, like Akko and Jaffa.  Third, it's important to not conflate ethnicity and national identity.  While we tend to think of them as overlapping in the US, but that's not the case elsewhere--many countries are nation-states, which have some sort of national group the country is associate with.  Israel does have issues of identity, but they're not racial.  The issues of Israeli identity are the same for non-Jewish Russians as they are for non-Jewish Ethiopians, and many issues of integration are the same for Ethiopian Jews and Russian ones."

You won't regret this. It just seems like you're ""the only person not having sex"" because this is an insecurity for you, and you're experiencing observational selection bias. You're primed to notice guys who are having sex.

I felt the way you did - totally left out because I was this prudish virgin - and then I ended up 'giving in' and slept with a few guys over a few years, and *that's* the part I really regret.

The great thing about sex is how mind-blowing it is to be so intimate and vulnerable with a guy you're crazily in love with. Seriously, there is no comparable feeling.

keypuncher,Republican,1390267443.0,"&gt; Ugh, the GOP is trying to pander to moderates in the wrong way.

Any pandering is a bad idea.  It doesn't work on people who might vote Republican.

&gt; We get so much more bad press talking about rape, gay marriage, and abortion than we do regarding illegal aliens.

Republicans get bad press talking about anything.  Doesn't matter what it is - the vast majority of the press is firmly in the pocket of the Democratic party.  On that basis, whether there is going to be bad press about a position shouldn't be a consideration on whether to take it.  What *should* be a consideration is how to deal with the bad press when it inevitably occurs.

&gt; We need to do away with this bible fucking and the batshit tea party if the Republican party wants to win a presidential in the near future..

The only people likely to do ""bible fucking"" would be liberals.  They would make it an interactive display, next to the Piss Christ, and pay for it with Federal Funds from the National Endowment for the Arts.

As to the Tea Party, they are the reason the Republicans took back the House, are responsible for most of the positive views of the Republican party, and are responsible for what little effort there has been to actually stand for the Republican Party platform.  If the Republican establishment actually succeeds in locking them out of the party, they will form a third party and Republicans will never again win a national election - because most of the Republican base is conservatives who identify with the Tea Party more than the Republican Establishment.

The one way to ensure that Republicans will never win another election is to pass an immigration bill - because that will go to conference with an Amnesty bill from the Senate, result in Amnesty, and we'll end up with 30 million new Americans, 20+ million of whom will vote Democrat.

&gt; After Hillary of course, because she'll win no doubt.

I wouldn't count on that.  It looks like some of the press is setting up to pull the rug out from under her in favor of another candidate."

BTW, although this dog does have very terv-like coloring, there's a couple of dead giveaways that he's a shepherd.  Look at the ears; they are large and set to the side of the head, as opposed to smaller and at the top of the head like a Terv.  The muzzle is also much larger than a terv's would be, and the head is much more square.

Writing code requires lots of strange modifiers, but luckily lots of the software we use to write code does things like adding close parentheses or end quotes (example: when you write (, it puts a close paren and places your cursor between them, like so: (|) which makes things much easier). 

I have had experience with this, I injured my wrists badly in my youth and junior year undergraduate, when working seriously in my computational lab I started experiencing serious wrist pain. I was really nervous and of course immediately implemented some better habits. I've been doing a lot better since :) 
My postdoc had serious issues at the time, and one of the other postdocs (not in my lab) had to quit his career basically because he just couldn't work. Ergonomic keyboards weren't enough. It is super sad, I don't want to ever get to that point.

The EITC itself is a minimum income that is paid by everyone - including businesses - out of our tax dollars. So from an efficiency standpoint, it probably makes more sense to just raise that. Strictly speaking, we could drop the minimum wage altogether, along with food stamps and welfare and tax deductions, and just give everyone a minimum income and have a more efficient picture (at least in theory).

That said, politics being what they are, I would never want to let the minimum wage stagnate and then have a less economically-minded (or ethically-minded) administration slash the EITC, so I support raising both."

You have to actually prove that the manipulation you want to do is possible, and to do that you have to first figure out exactly what your infinite sum notation is denoting. In the case of convergent series, it's the limit of the sequence of partial sums. This is the standard meaning for the infinite summation notation so we just say series where such a limit does not exist are ""divergent"" and leave it at that. You don't have to do this. You can use another meaning for infinite summation notation if you like. One of the simplest conceptually is Cesaro summation, where the sum is not the limit of the sequence of partial sums, but the limit of the sequence of arithmetic means of the first n partial sums. There is an ""abelian theorem"" for this summation method, which guarantees that it gives the same result as the standard one for any convergent series; summation methods without such a theorem are generally not considered, since they're inconsistent with the normal meaning of an infinite sum.

The canonical book is Divergent Series by Hardy."

17to85,canada,1390268629.0,"I think there is a real change, all the people who have a chance to win are big ladies who can hit power. Yes Serena (and venus when she was still good) are anomalies, but they did force the players who couldn't generate power out and ushered in more big players who could hit with them. I think the real issue is that a lot of them aren't the naturally skilled type and they don't have the mental strength that Williams has. They are prone to inconsistency. 

The rallies are rarer in the mens game simply because the skill level is so high that they don't give as many returnable balls when you look at how a prime Federer would build a point from the serve it was a thing of beauty. He always had one of the best serves on tour but it wasn't because he was out hitting guys, the placement was just so precise that he dictated what the other guy was going to do and eventually he was going to put him in a position where there was no chance he could return the next shot. That's why Nadal was such a pain in the ass to him. Nadal could run down all those set up shots and get them coming back so hard at such an angle that it put Federer on the defensive in one stroke. Rallies in and of themselves are not exciting and to me more an indication that the level of play is not that high. "

By definition, there can only be one of those. It either exists or it does not. The existence of anything else that is seen as a deity yet not the supreme being is actually pretty irrelevant.

Christians may be wrong about whether or not God exists. Christians may be wrong about what traits God has. But if Zeus, Odin... exists, the proper thing for a Christian to do would be to spread the Gospel to them, not worship them.

In other words, when you're talking to a monotheists, you're better off considering any other God as either the same deity but with a different name/traits (THE supreme being), or simply a super powerful spiritual/divine/alien being.

As for your questions. 1. Yes, only one thing could fit the definition. 2. I don't refute the possibility of super powerful beings. I just wouldn't worship them.

Neebat,starbound,1390269309.0,"The people downvoting DDD are off-base here.

From the official website ([here](http://playstarbound.com/info-about-the-upcoming-patch/)):

&gt; Of course, there’s also the highly anticipated/possibly feared **final character wipe** – this patch contains a fix for save files so after this, you won’t need to worry about our patches destroying your characters or ships. This patch will wipe everything– characters, ships and worlds. **It will definitely be the last time we’ll need to wipe characters or ships,** and will hopefully be the last time we’ll need to wipe worlds. 

&gt; “The problem is that the organization of planets may change so if they go muck with a planet, how do we put it in the celestial map? Or if they build on a biome we remove, or something. So no promises, but we’ll try. **But promises on the player / ship.**”

Emphasis mine.  The structure is a bit weird, but I think it's pretty clear they're promising not to wipe characters or ships again.

Edit:  I have to take issue with this statement specifically, because Steam has very strict policies on this:

&gt; if down the road they have to change something drastically their is still the possibility of having to do another one.

Once a game has gone live, Valve's policy demands no patch that breaks saved game progress.  Sorry, I can't give a source for this.  It was probably an NDA-breaking admission from a developer, so I shouldn't say which developer.  They were very clear that they had to get a system in place to prevent patches from breaking save games before they could go live."

Rhydon is a physical attacker, so special attacks like fire blast and thunder are going to be weak coming off of it.

If azumarill has huge power as an ability you're going to want to use physical attacks as well, so no pump or scald.

I see you really focusing on powerful moves, but those moves are often best used by other Pokemon, find the niche of each Pokemon you want to use. That will help you build a more cohesive team.

Remember, power isn't everything.

Jess_than_three,DnD,1390269558.0,"So, I threw together a PHP script for fun, to see how likely these sorts of rolls actually were. I intended to demonstrate that you were wrong and that the guy's stats were **much** likelier than you thought - but in fact it's a fair bit **less** likely. OTOH, your own stats aren't as unlikely as you think.

**If you don't care about the guts of the script, skip to the bolded section below.**

[You can view the script here, if you'd like to see what I did.](http://pastebin.com/vQGfFJEq) (Or, if you'd like to try it for yourself, you can install [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (if you're on Windows), then [Microsoft Virtual C++](http://www.faqforge.com/windows/fix-the-program-cant-start-because-msvcr100-dll-is-missing-from-your-computer-error-on-windows/) if it gives you an error regarding MSVCR100.dll; run WAMP, click on the icon in your system tray and go to Apache-&gt;service-&gt;install, then go to restart; create a file name 4d6.php in C:\wamp\www, and paste the contents of the pastebin into it, then in your browser go to http://localhost/4d6.) It's not especially elegant, but in a nutshell it:

* rolls 4d6, rerolling any ones

* drops the lowest roll

* saves the score

* repeats that 5 more times, to generate a set of stats

* saves the set

* repeats that 99,999 more times, to create 100,000 total sets

It then looks for:

* the number of 18s in each set

* the number of scores 16 or higher, 16 or 17, 14 or 15, 10 or lower, 16 or lower, and 14 or lower in each set

* the number of instances of any given roll 

before reporting

* the average roll

* the number of ""high rollers"": sets with at least three 18s, at least one 16/17, and all scores 14 or higher (which is to say, sets as good as or better than your friend's)

* what those sets were, if there were any

* the number of ""low rollers"": sets with no rolls greater than 16, no more than one roll greater than 14, and no more than 2 rolls greater than 10 (so, sets as bad as or worse than your own)

* what those sets were, if there were any

* how often each given roll occurred

**Here's what I found**:

1. The average roll for your system is just over 13.4.

2. There's somewhere in the neighborhood of a .045% chance of rolling 3 eighteens. Out of 500,000 sets of rolls (five page refreshes), I saw 17 total sets that rolled as high as your friend did or higher - .0034% (but given the relative numbers there's a big margin of error there). There were also 6 sets with *four* 18s, and one set with **five** eighteens - but I checked and it wasn't considered a ""high-rolling"" set, presumably because the sixth score was below 14; so I have no idea what it was. Counting all of those sets as amazing rolls and assuming that none of the quad-18 sets were included in the ""high rollers"", you're still only looking at .0048% of the total. That's still something like a 1 in 20,000 chance.

3. There's something like a .17% (1 in 573) chance of rolling as badly as you did, or worse. I'd definitely call that ""unreasonably low"", although it's nothing like the 1 in 65,000 chance you cite.

4. There's actually something like a .22% (1 in 454) chance of rolling 4 or more scores that are 10 or lower.

6. You're sixteen times as likely to roll an 18 as a 6. You're slightly likelier to roll an 18 than you are an 8, and slightly less likely to roll an 18 than a 9.

7. There's about an 85% chance you won't roll any 18s, a 14% chance you'll roll only one, and about a 1% chance you'll roll 2.

**TL;DR:** Your friend rolled *incredibly* well, and you rolled very badly, but nowhere near as badly as you think."

No it isn't.

It's not actually faster, and a lot of the benchmarks had to be re-run after people learned that a 5 minute timer was taking a lot less than 5 minutes.

Dont forget you live together! Obviously she wants to feel comfortable around you.

I strongly recommend that you look into online dating or try to go out More so you get some experiences with women and read the signs better. And as many already said here: It is almost impossible to start something with a confession like that. It is too much pressure for the other person and hardly anyone would feel comfortable with it even if they feel something too."

RichAfterTaxes,gamecollecting,1390270127.0,"I can't seem to ID that exact 8-in-1, but it appears to be a pretty ordinary bootleg Game Boy multicart. It also seems to be an early one for several reasons: the cart is gray, it still looks similar to an official GB cart, and it has a fairly low number of games. Many later multicarts deviated from this formula with wonky-looking (and often huge) cart shapes, strange colors intended to resemble GBC and/or Pokemon carts, and unrealistic promises of untold dozens of games. 

Many of these early multicarts shared several ""usual suspect"" games, some of which were not even released in America. They were almost certainly chosen due to being simple games that take up little memory. I can't read your cart's label, but I will venture to guess that it has at least a few of these: 

* Dr. Mario 
* Super Mario Land 
* Flipull 
* Flappy Special 
* Tasmania Story 
* Alleyway 
* Tetris

duggtodeath,atheism,1390270920.0,"&gt; Your atheism is just fantastic, but the fact that your cheering for the downfall of other peoples beliefs is beyond ridiculous and you should feel stupid for promoting such a mindset.

A belief system that promotes slavery, abuse of children, women as second-class citizens, polygamy, telepathic communication, talking animals, giants, mythological creatures, incest and the whole-sale slaughter of innocent people for slight offenses from a deity who wants to save us from what he will do to use if we don't let him save us?

&gt; I would like to imagine that most atheists aren't championing for other peoples belief systems to fail.

We are promoting living in reality. False beliefs give people poor decision making skills and hurt people and get people killed. Front page today had two toddlers dead from a botched exorcism. It's not fun and games when unproven beliefs get people killed.

&gt; Christians don't go to church every Sunday and pray for atheists to diminish from the face of the earth.

I wonder what the Bible says about atheists/unbelievers:

""2 Chronicles 15:12-13 ESV - And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul, but that whoever would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman."""

bigtcm,AskReddit,1390271334.0,"A little late to the party, and I've posted this before. Let's see if anyone sees this.

TL, DR: The novel below describes how I believe my mother is the sole reason why her three children are single, and not particularly ready to mingle. Probably also describes why we're not a particularly close family either.

My mother pretty much banned us from interacting with the opposite gender growing up. I didn't go to any high school dances. I was a shy awkward kid in high school. When we finally moved out to go to college, her philosophy instantly flipped 180 - suddenly we had to quickly find a wife/husband to marry and pop out kids. I can't speak for my brother (more on this at the very end), but I know that my sister and I received numerous phone calls on a weekly basis from my mother, talking shit to us.

**No that is not an exaggeration. She'd call us, not to give advice, but to talk shit.**

She'd call us and recall how easy it was for her to get boys all the time and how they'd chase her home. She'd giggle and tell us stories about how her professor asked her to stay after class and wonder what was wrong with us. She'd tell us how it was a waste that she gave birth to such beautiful kids and how none of us were interested in pursuing a relationship. We tried explaining how we didn't know what we were doing and she would have none of it.

In college, I discovered that I was a pretty social person and people liked me. I made loads of friends and had tons of fun. It's not too surprising to find out then, that, I got myself a girlfriend during my 2nd year of college. My mother was so happy. She was so proud that all the ""advice"" she had been giving me for the last year and a half wasn't all for naught.

And my mother was LIVID when we broke up two years later. She would call me up, ask me questions, and proceed to completely tune out my answers. She thought I was some douchebag and that I mistreated my ex. I ended up calling up my ex, apologizing to her for doing this in advance, and then sticking her on the phone to tell my mom that I was an alright guy. My mother would also chat with my ex's mom over weekly sessions of coffee, and the two of them would just agree that I was a terrible guy. I just stopped picking up her phone calls because I realized that my sanity was slowly waning. Eventually my dad would call me to ask about something completely unrelated, and then my mom would ask to use the phone. She'd make small talk for about five minutes and as soon as she asked about dating or my ex, I'd hang up.

A decade now has passed since all that drama. My ex and I are the best of friends. Things with my mother and me are better now as well; my mother has apologized and knows not stick her nose in my relationship business anymore. The ex's mother has also apologized to me. I'm now her surrogate nephew/son.

There are several other scattered stories here and there, but it's been much calmer with my mom since that first girlfriend:

* My mother presented me my dead grandmother's wedding ring when I brought over another girl home for Thanksgiving dinner. I had been dating this girl for a month.

* My mother called up her ailing father in Asia so he could help ""convince me"" not to go back to school and to hurry up and give him great grand kids.

But overall, she's calmed way down. I think she's realized that giving us shit is not going to do anything to help ""motivate us"" to get married.

So that brings us to present day. It's interesting to hear how each of the three of us handled the mother situation differently. I just let it slide off my back. My sister internalizes it and blows up every now and then. My brother has become a recluse.

I'm currently a single, 30 year old man who has had only 3 serious relationships in his entire life (and no casual ones). I have many friends who are girls, but few, if any, romantic interests. When asked about my relationships now, I'll just tell my mother that I'm gay. Or that I'm dating a black woman (My mom's biggest fear - me dating a black woman. I'm not kidding). I'm polite to my mother (I mean, she did give birth to me), but I really don't speak with her too much. I think she's finally started to realize that I'm not really going to take her ""advice"" to heart, so she's stopped hassling me for the most part.

My sister is 28 and has never been kissed, never had a relationship, hell, I don't think she's even held hands with a boy yet. My mother is most concerned about her getting married because apparently my sister is ""getting old and unmarriageable"". It's not surprising then to know that I can't remember the last time the two of them had a conversation that didn't end in a screaming match. My mother will ALWAYS bring up how my sister needs to find a husband and my sister will straight up tell my mother that it's HER fault that she isn't married already...which soon devolves into the aforementioned screaming match.

My brother fell completely off the map. We know where he lives. We know what he does for a living, and that's about it. You could tell me that my brother pimps crack ho's and has sired ten illegitimate children, and I wouldn't be too shocked. My mother is afraid to ask my brother what's going on, so she'll ask me to ask him for updates. I always flatly refuse: ""Mom, I really don't care what he's doing, as long as he's staying out of trouble. If you really want to know what's going on, why not ask him yourself? He's your son"". I think she might be afraid of the truth."

sir_sri,technology,1390272191.0,"&gt;Are you fucking serious? 
The benchmarks that most third parties run are on the same machines that run Win7.

I'm not saying windows 8 doesn't execute programs correctly, but the clock is/was tied to the CPU, making it... problematic for benchmarking.  This is so the clock is unified between the ARM and x86 versions (Intel and AMD have been using hardware clocks for like a decade, whereas ARM doesn't support the same one).  Software clock means when a clock dynamically changes or is overclocked to simulate other  processors the clock goes slower or faster.  This causes no end of grief in benchmarking.


http://www.extremetech.com/computing/164209-windows-8-banned-by-worlds-top-benchmarking-and-overclocking-site

Any benchmark from before that discovery is complete junk.  


http://www.hardocp.com/article/2013/11/24/battlefield_4_windows_7_vs_81_performance_review/4

Has some fairly new numbers on 7 vs 8.1... and... it's a wash.  8.1 might be percent or 2 faster.

&gt; E.g. Win8 saves the kernel state to hard drive when shutting down, making it a faster boot.

Which is essentially irrelevant to the overall experience when you're talking about boot times of 10-20 seconds.  In terms of actual system performance and since this isn't the 1998's and you shouldn't need to reboot your computer more than once a month rather than multiple times a day.

Don't get me wrong, the hyrid hibernate shutdown tech is good, and the wacky clock problem was a deliberate effort to make  life easier for people like me who write serious software.  But you're not gaining anything notable once the system is started by having windows 8 in terms of performance anyway.

wordswench,GradSchool,1390272236.0,"So I'm a grad student somewhere amazing. I felt exactly this way as an undergrad and still feel this way to some extent. Here are some things people told me that helped:

1. My advisor (before he passed away ...) told me: 99% of going somewhere is wanting to get there. 0% of it is being able to. Things you can do easily aren't worth doing, and if you aren't struggling, you aren't learning or growing.

2. Grad school isn't about doing something that exists. It's about doing something new and creating it. This is fucking hard. This is why grad school takes 6 years, not 6 months. If you aren't failing you're either VERY lucky, or not reaching for anything cool. 

3. Only you decide when you're not good enough. I've seen people drop majors because they felt dumb - while being in the top 10% of their class. They weren't failing, they just felt like it. Until you stop being able to do something, and right now you clearly can, keep going.

Source: I did a degree nobody thought I could (including me), and then got into a school nobody thought I could (including me).

Perhaps you shouldn't knock it till you've tried it. I've run continuously to complete four marathons and quite a few half marathons -- and never had to death march at the end -- so I no longer have anything to prove on that front. I tried run-walk intervals this past weekend in a half-marathon for the first time, to accommodate a running buddy who had missed a couple of long runs in training but still wanted to do the race while minimizing the risk of injury.  I thoroughly enjoyed being able to run my ""run"" intervals at a faster pace than my normal continuous-run pace, and felt a lot better at the end of the race than I usually do.  

For me, and I expect many other runners, run-walk is just one more technique in the bag of running tactics that I hope will keep me running injury-free well into my old age."

Renner1,canada,1390272559.0,"&gt;  Its funny to me that the people who accuse Israel of appropriating ""anti-Semite"" are often the ones themselves that have appropriated ""Apartheid"" and used it to their own advantage.

Well, they have appropriated ""anti Semitism"" to mean ""someone who's SO MEEN to precious untouchable Israel"". Or otherwise anyone who doesn't kiss Israeli ass 24/7 and pretend that they're blameless and it's DA NASTY AYRABS who are the cause of the strife and the on-going situation in Palestine.

&gt; I'm not calling him a liar. I'm calling him misinformed because if he thinks Israel is an Apartheid state, he clearly does not know what Apartheid was.

So he's just a dope because he doesn't acknowledge that the Jews graciously allowed his dirty Palestinian hide into the Knesset?

Have I got that right?

Because that's the main thing that pro-Israelis bring up. ""There are a dozen Palestinians in the Knesset! Israel treats Palestinians so well, they have nothing to complain about! They're liars!""

And that's the thing-- with the majority of these people, ""Lying Palestinians"" comes up again and again.

Make her want it bad. If you're not going to do the finger thing I mentioned make sure your hands are always busy, whether they're caressing her body or massaging her boobs, use your hands.

famouscomposer,linguistics,1390273399.0,"Alright, I am in no way a linguist.  Just someone who has always been fascinated by sound, and specifically, language.  I'm a native English speaker from the US.  I've recently had a bit of a theory about rhotic vs non-rhotic English.  I'm sure this is something that has been established already, but I'm asking this question directly.

My theory is that the letter R originally had two pronunciations, *almost* like a vowel.  I don't think this is a far fetched theory, as the letter R is a voiced consonant, and seems to follow a set of rules.  In British English, words that either end in, or contain the letter R have a distinct pronunciation.  Even though the R is never actually *said,* you still know that it's there.  So when people say that non-rhotic accents ""drop the R,"" maybe they're not entirely correct.  Non-rhotic English just uses multiple pronunciations of the letter.

I equate it to something like the letter C.  We know that a hard C makes a ""K"" sound, like in ""crime,"" but with the right placement within a word, it sounds like an ""S,"" as with, ""prince.""  I think that a fairly similar rule applies to the letter, ""R,"" but perhaps has been lost, or has become one of those, ""optional,"" rules of the English language, like the Oxford comma.

My question is:  How correct is my theory?  Is there an entirely different history about the letter R that I should know about?  If I'm wrong, could you please explain to me what the actual reason for this is?

Thank you in advance to anyone who was able to make it through my rambling and over use of quotation marks!

EDIT - I forgot to include that maybe we should be saying, ""A, E, I, O, U and sometimes R.""  That was a dumb joke, forgive me."

Thav,3Dprinting,1390273447.0,"An extremely rough guide to manual PID tuning (not that you should, because autotune is great in this instance) is:

(P)roportional gain - increase to reduce response time, too much can cause overshoot and ringing

(I)ntegral gain- increase to reduce steady state error (temp has a hard time reaching set point), too much of this can also cause overshoot and ringing

(D)erivative gain - increase slightly to reduce overshoot and ringing (instability), but is very susceptible to noise in measurements, leading to noisy output.

Usually the P and I terms are  sufficient to get a system responding  satisfactorily, but D can be helpful in systems where natural resonances are present.

I first noticed it when I was watching television. I can’t remember the name of the program, but that doesn’t matter. It was the commercial break that sent me into a newfound state of euphoria. I usually flip through channels during the commercials, a man thing, but for some reason landed back at my program a few seconds before it would be starting again. ‘Arms of an Angel’ played over silent videos of ill and abused animals, before flashing back to Sarah McLachlan’s face asking for my donations. A lab sat between her knees, panting from the bright lights of the studio. The chord progression, the animals, the plea McLachlan had sent out to thousands of North Americans made me... *Happy?*


No, not happy. I didn’t feel happy. I felt *euphoric!* Then my program came back on, and I snapped back to reality. My hands dug deep into the arms of my recliner. I was in a cold sweat and my body was slightly numb. Had I taken a stroke? A heart attack? I put my hands on my head, feeling a dull ache push against my skull. I quickly pulled on a shirt and drove myself to the hospital. Again, driving after you think you have had a stroke? Total man thing.


I arrived at the ER and handed the receptionist my health card. By now, my vision was blurry and blackness clawed at the corner of my eyes. 


“And what are you here for today sir?” she politely asked, typing on her computer, each keystroke tap, tap, tapping into my skull like dull nails being bashed into my grey matter. 


“I’ve had a stroke or heart attack or something, brain aneurysm maybe. Do you die with those, or...? Anyways, I have a bad migraine, and my vision is, weird. It felt really good first though, but then it got like this.”


The nurse looked at me through the glass, hands neatly in place to begin clanking on her keyboard again, “It felt good first?”


I rubbed my eyes, panicking, “Yeah, like, euphoric. Really, really high. I mean, like, have you done, well, yeah, cocaine?” I asked.


“No, sir, I *haven’t* tried cocaine.”


“Well, I did once in college, and it’s like that. It’s not mellow, like weed. It’s like, euphoria on top of what I figure it would be like to be on LSD or mushrooms. Lots of, well, swirls and, my vision, gets colorful. Sarah McLachlan’s lab melted between her legs, and the music was coming to me in shapes.” I was stuttering and sweating, hands on my eyes, rubbing furiously. 


The receptionist stood, “Sir, I just have to grab something, please stay seated here.” She quickly hustled to the hallway behind the triage counter. 


I bent down and cradled my aching head. Why was she leaving? I needed medical attention now! There was hardly anyone in the waiting room, get me in there and take care of this, I may not have much time. I hear shuffling back behind the receptionists counter.


“He’s gone?” the nurse shrilly exclaimed. 


“He’s gone! He’s probably realized we know he’s jonseing.” a deep voice punctured my eardrums and resonated throughout my skull, shattering my nerves like a fragile glass breaking on concrete in slow motion. 


I sat up and stared at the receptionist and two large men in banana yellow security polos. “I’m here. And I’d like to add, I’m *not* jonseing. I’d like to see a doctor, stat.” Angry with the miscalculation of the receptionist and fearing for my life, I conversed stalely to convey a different persona to the receptionist. I turned from the trio to a television in a dusty corner of the waiting room. Sure enough, we were rolling commercials. McLachlan sat with her lab, muted for the comfort of those of us waiting with crippling migraines. Digital-looking letters flashed white on a thick strip of black rectangle. A statistic played: *“hundreds of household pets are abused everyday, and thousands are killed around the globe hourly.”*


I felt a tingle in the stem of my brain. My nerves were calming, and my aching head subsided. I breathed a sign of relief as the security guards argued whether or not to cuff me to a stretcher. I waved my hands at them, “I just want a doctor to make sure I’m alright. I think I may have taken a stroke.” The guards scratched their head, and the receptionist led me to a room. As I walked a few steps behind her, I found myself looking over my shoulder to catch the last few seconds of the commercial. I broke eye contact with the television, and held my head low as the pain swelled to my temples like tears to a newborns eyes. Fragile, and with desire. 
So much desire that it *literally* hurt."

Most soldiers do not die in war, and as it's likely ISIS will not be victorious those fighters will have to go somewhere. What if they try to return home?

I suppose they'll just detain them or deport them somewhere that Sweden doesn't care about extremists causing misery in. I have no doubt that they'll have some half-assed measure that the far right in the country will instantly leap on and try to use as a platform to get everyone in Sweden who's from Syria deported or something similar, regardless of what socioeconomic background they have in Sweden or their personal socio-political convictions.

Yes, I do take issue with the garbage spilled out by virtually all of the Jewish community organizations in Canada. It's absolutely shameful.

&gt;&gt; As the Prime Minister himself said 

&gt;&gt; Of course, criticism of Israeli government policy is not in and of itself necessarily anti-Semitic.

And then he went on some rubbish spiel about ""criticism of Israel is anti Semitism"" and ""new anti Semitism"" and ""I'm your best friend in the whole world, Israel"" and was pretty nauseating in general.

&gt; You do not appear to be very open to anything remotely pro-Israel; your rhetoric betrays you.

Betrays me as what? 

Yes, I am staunchly pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist. I haven't heard *any* pro-Israel argument that doesn't demonize the Palestinians and other Arabs, or pretend that the Jews were ""entitled to all of Palestine, and the Palestinians should have recognized that and moved away en masse"".

&gt; I said Tibi is either an idiot or a dickhead.

Both of those sound like characteristics of people in the Likud party, to me-- considering we're breaking out the insults and all. Lieberman and the Israeli right wing are even more deserving of those labels.

The likes of Lapid, as well, come to think of it.

**Here's what I found**:

1. After running this script several times, I *have yet* to see even *one* set with three or more 18s.

2. Which means that unless I did something very badly wrong (and the numbers overall make sense, so I don't believe I did), there is probably *much* less than a one in 42,875 chance. 

3. There's something like a 4% (1 in 25) chance of rolling as badly as you did, or worse. You rolled very low, but not **unreasonably** low.

4. There's actually a not-quite-5% (1 in 20) chance of rolling 4 or more scores that are 10 or lower

5. You're likelier to roll **all** six numbers 10 or lower than you are to get three 18s

6. You're twenty times as likely to roll an 18 as a 3. You have about equal odds of rolling an 18 as you do a 6.

7. There's about a 90% chance you won't roll any 18s, a just over 9% chance you'll roll only one, and about a quarter of a percent chance you'll roll 2.

**TL;DR:** Your friend rolled *incredibly* well, and you rolled very badly but not unspeakably badly.

juped,math,1390275130.0,"What you've got to define is actually the notation a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... = S.

You're familiar with the standard definition involving the limit of the sequence of partial sums. You may not be familiar with the Riemann zeta function, which is the analytic continuation (extension of the domain of a function in a certain ""nice"" way) of the function

ζ(s) = (1/1^s ) + (1/2^s ) + (1/3^s ) + ...

This function is defined for those s where the series converges, and then the domain is extended to the entire complex plane except 1 by analytic continuation. This function is holomorphic (complex analysis for ""nice"") everwhere except 1, where it has a simple pole (""blows up to infinity"", basically). You get -1/12 by evaluating ζ(-1), and if you transpose -1 back into the starting definition, it is of course 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ...

So if you're doing summation by zeta function regularization, that's what you're saying. It's a thing you can do, and it's a thing that you can reasonably want to denote with the notation of an infinite sum. It's not any different an ""equals"" from any other ""equals"". It's not standard, though, so you have to make it clear you're doing this. When not otherwise specified, the infinite sum notation is the usual thing with the limit of partial sums."

Don't think this is a fair comparison. Both women and men can do manual labor, even though larger muscle mass is statistically more common among men. 

However, every single man in the world is physically unable to produce breast milk. It is not a generalization or a statistical tendency. The mother, if she is able nurse, is biologically best able to to feed the baby during it's infancy. 

&gt; There are many breast milk substitutes that are no different than a mothers breast milk. That is no argument for custody.

This is not necessarily true. Doctors always recommend breast milk over any formula or substitute. One reason for this is that breast milk provides anti-bodies that prevent diseases while formulas do not. It would be wonderful if formula were no different than breast milk, babies would be healthier and society would be far more equal, sadly that is not the case. 

If the mother can't produce milk anyway, the argument is invalid.

I also mentioned transporting breast milk from the mother to the father or getting a wet nurse but these are less than ideal for the reasons I mentioned. "

For that matter, there's nearly a one in six chance, with straight 4d6-drop-the-lowest, that you don't have *any* scores below an 11, and just a one in five chance that three or more scores will be. 

When you reroll 1s, your average score shoots up to nearly 13.5, and now you've got nearly a 50% chance to not have anything below an 11, and only a *3%* or so chance of three or more stats below 11. (And like a 15% chance of even *two* or more!)

For example, Find a systems integration consultant and they should know:  

 - What the different test cycles are, and why they're important.  
 - How you should set up your gating criteria.  
 - What's required for a successful go live  
 - Requirements necessary for post go live support and transition to production support.  

None of those skills have anything to do with consulting.  The *reason* they're looking for a consultant is because companies tend not to need a specific skill set long term.  

If you want to be a good consultant, learn lots about what you're going to do (Tech / Government / Management) and what you're going to do (Retail / Military / Healthcare).  You need to be at least 1 day smarter than the client to really add value."

Hamas has it's issues and is undesirable, but they don't behave in the very worst way akin to other very conservative Islamist groups.


As I said before, Hezbollah is unique in the sense that it seems to be quite unlike the vast majority of the ""armed Islamist groups"" the world over.

Ahhhh nooo! No hot water! Warm at the very most. Honey is antiseptic and antibacterial because it's acidic (so is your skin, your skin loves stuff that keeps its pH in line) which inhibits bacteria, it stops air and water getting to bacteria, and it forms hydrogen peroxide when exposed to air (ie. not under a dressing). So it's pretty good for the skin! It's gentle, it's the right pH, it effs up those little zit causing bacteria, it's good for wounds, all great stuff. But ahhhh, hot water! Not so good. Much inflammation, very broken capillaries, so red, wow. But the honey's great! Hyperpigmentation is the worst. I hates it. Like, I got rid of the pimple WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?"

Good times."
Rhodechill,depression,1390276749.0,"Meh.  A lot.  It began with just having general depression, perhaps due to being poor and having irresponsible and neglectful parents who always fought and argued even after divorce, coupled with social anxiety.  Then things began to pick up when my dad went insane one summer and started physically destroying my house.  I felt threatened and needed to call the cops.  I moved with my mom again, and couldn't bear that - her house was a pig stye (filthy beyond comprehension) and she was verbally and emotionally abusive.  My dad wasn't arrested, but I had a no contact order with him for 2 months (my entire summer vacation).  Then, when I moved with my dad again, he had quit his job and things were going down the shithole.  Couldn't afford basic supplies, clothes, haircuts, etc.  Then our house was foreclosed.  Moved in with my uncle who was 30 minutes by car away from my school.  My dad never had money for gas and to take the city bus meant a 20 minute walk and then an 80 minute bus ride.  That's 200 minutes of transportation just to visit a friend or anything else in my hometown.  My uncle was mentally unstable, and the house we were living in was actually illegal, but I didn't know that.  My uncle's house was basically foreclosed, but he ended up living there anyway and my dad moved in also, not telling me it was illegal.  I had nearly perfect attendance for the year, but as soon as I moved into my uncle's house, I was late and absent all the time.  My father simply *would not take me to school on time*.  I would have to wake him up, and he was never ready.  I ended up racking up over 35 tardies and 18 absences during the last two quarters of my senior year.  My grades were plummeting, my sleep schedule was fucked up.  I was depressed to the point where I'd sleep for 15 hours a day sometimes, not have the will to do any homework.  I applied to over 33 jobs between my junior and senior years and only heard back from 3 of those 33.  Had 3 interviews, and got the job for none of them.  I don't even know how that is possible, but it was.  I began taking depression medication during my sophmore year, and they helped for about 5 months, and then I just got completely desensitized to them.  They don't help me anymore, and I've tripled my original dose since.  I had a counselor, which helped, but then I turned 18 and my healthcare expired and I cannot afford him anymore.  Also, I forgot to mention, but my uncle's house also was absolutely freezing during the winter.  I'd say the average temperature indoors there was 55 to 60 degrees.  Only heat source was a kerosene heater with very limited amounts of fuel we had to use sparsely.  The house was large and only heated up the room it was in.  I also had a small electrical heater in my room, but whenever I would use it, my uncle would yell at me harshly.  I had to be stealthy with it, but I still kept getting caught.  He got very angry and aggressive.  He eventually lost his sanity from stress (mostly from past experiences, not from me, I promise (it's just the way I explained it that might make it sound like that lol)) and my uncle fled from Rhode Island to Canada for months unexpectedly.  He was receiving eviction notices, but my dad and I never heard about it.

Then one day after classes for senior year had ended and I came home from graduation rehearsal, only to find my house locked and boarded up, with everything inside of it taken out by a moving company. I was shocked.  Called my dad, waited outside in the rain 'till he came home.  Everything was taken away.  

This included, but was not limited to the following: My nearly 6 full notebooks of journal entries I have been documenting moments of my life with since prior to teenagehood, useful archives such as goals, a bucket list, things I wished to purchase in my lifetime, biking accomplishments and statistics, every essay I've ever written, my college essay, every yearbook I have ever owned, every piece of schoolwork I have ever done, every photo I've ever had, the suit I wore to prom, $150 cash, thousands of dollars worth of videogame related items, every article of clothing I had except for the ones I was wearing to my graduation rehearsal, two computers, couches, chairs, my HDTV, other pieces of furniture, all things like dishes, pans, fridge... etc., every book I've owned, my first tooth, all photographs and photoalbums, and my phone.

9 months later and I haven't gotten it back, because my dad couldn't pay for the storage fee expenses.  He FINALLY got a job, but it's low paying and part time (he dropped out of high school in tenth grade), so idk if I'll ever be able to get my stuff back (and the fees increase $150 every month, and soon (idk when), my stuff could get auctioned off).  Also, he's not even sure if he thinks it's worth getting the stuff back.  It's not really even the valuable things that matter much to me - it's a lot to do with the archives and memories I would be losing.  These past 9 months have left me with a very dark and very empty feeling in my stomach.

Anyway, while living with my uncle, I still did manage to apply to college and get accepted despite battling some of the darkest depression I have experienced yet.  While my 11th and 12th grade grades were rather suckish, my 9th and 10th amazingness pulled up my GPA and class ranks and writing skills enough to get accepted into a decent college.  If I had kept my academic performance up like I did in the beginning of high school, though, I would probably be swimming in scholarships and a prestigious college right now.  But, whatever.

(I'm afraid that even if I ever get better now, my brain will still be fucked up in some ways permanently.  For example, I'm a dark, insensitive guy now who laughs at dark humor and jokes about suicide now like it's normal -  I could never see my innocent 15 year old self ever turning into something like this).

Anywho, yup.  Got into college.  A lot of unexpected complications happened though with loans and scholarships I thought I was going to get.

Oh and btw, after my uncle's house was evicted, my dad was homeless and I, too.  My best friend let me live with him.  It was a rough transition for me.  And at the time he had already began a path of delving into frequent drug use.  Weed, alcohol, acid, DMT, shrooms, cough syrup, mouthwash, chewing tobacco.  I'm worried for him. :/

For a $27,000/year school, and with maxed out federal loans and grants, I got up to $25,000.  $2000 short.  Got a term bill hold on my account.  Couldn't enroll in classes for the spring semester.  Sitting here on reddit now, waiting to talk to enrollment services tomorrow if they could sympathetically lift my hold for the semester till i figure something out / get a cosigner.  My grandparents might eb a possibility.
Worried and depressed as fuck I won't be able to attend my college anymore.  Won't have a place to live, either.  Maybe my friend will be kind again and let me live wirh him again in his hometown.  Maybe I can live in another on-campus friend's dorm secretly till all 2014 when I can go to the new college.  idk.
Winter break ended for me, so I moved back on campus today.  Found out my meal plan doesn;t work so I cant get food.  had to use a friend's guest pass.  They're limited in quanitity.

(I'm afraid that even if I ever get better now, my brain will still be fucked up in some ways permanently.  For example, I'm a dark, insensitive guy now who laughs at dark humor and jokes about suicide now like it's normal -  I could never see my innocent 15 year old self ever turning into something like this.  I also have developed OCD, more anxiety, and just have weird in general and don't know how to be responsible, motivated, or happy).

Not even sure if, even if I has a stable house and schooling, if I'd even be non-depressed.

Well, I'd be better certainly, but certainly not perfect either.

Oh, and my 1st semester of college was spent without a laptop or phone.  Yay.


For the record, my uncle is diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia and is in a really bad mental state.  Since Winter 2012, he lost over 90lbs and doesn't eat or drink anymore, and barely communicates due to some insanely powerful form of mental illness.  Also, one of my best friends perished in October.  Brought me down a lot.

Disclaimer: this post was written stream-of-conscious style, so the organization of this might be very confusing to other readers.  I'm sorry for that, and I will clear up any confusion you might have if you draw my attention to it.  Also, this just covers a few of the bad things that occured in my life.  There are a lot more details that I didn't list for the sake of time.


edit:

tl;dr: shitty parents, lost tweo different houses in a little over half a year, every item ive ever owned is in storage, dealt with mental decay and a death, grades dropped, poverty....

thesilvertongue,changemyview,1390276828.0,"I'm just playing devils advocate here. The danish system does not appeal to me at all. For one, it applies to all children, not just babies who require milk. Babies are the only situation where a woman might be better suited for custody. 

Because women are able to produce breast milk and men are not, they are better suited to feed the infant. This was not meant to be a controversial statement about gender roles, but rather a biological fact. Human breast milk is the best food for a baby and women are unique in their ability to produce it. 

Since you care about my personal beliefs, I consider myself a feminist and believe that child care should be split equally among parents even though women provide milk. When men and women live under the same roof and breast milk can be easily stored at home, feeding the baby can easily be a shared task. 

However, custody ought to go to the party best able to provide for the infant. In the case of a baby, this party would be the one who is biologically equipped to produce milk. 

Even the most radical of feminists would find it hard to disagree that someone who can breastfeed is better equipped to feed a child than someone who cannot.

The crazy irrational part is honestly the part that irks me the most. Her sudden change of heart with the opposite gender thing is sort of par for the course when it comes to her. One day she'll say how proud of me she is since I'm currently working on a PhD. The next day she'll call me up and tell me how I should cut my hair and to wear puffy fur lined jackets and skinny jeans...she'll tell me if I looked ""cool"" like a Korean pop star, I might have better luck finding a wife.

FeatherDie,AskWomen,1390277399.0,"The best way to get modeling jobs is to find work with local stores in your area. Those local stores that shoot those kind of crummy quality commercials. You can network with those local businesses and see how they go about finding models for their clothing/jewelry lines. You can also network with the local television and radio companies to find what kind of agencies they work with. 

There are also many nationally recognized talent/model agencies that travel to smaller cities for big modeling events. It is not going to get you the best work, but it could be a foot in the door to meet other models and professionals in the business. 

Network network network. 

Also, don't spend a lot of money for jobs in the beginning. Find a local studio to take photographs for a portfolio, and don't spend 1000$ or something with an agency trying to get a job. That's where most people get scammed. 'Spend 500$ and we'll find you a job.' Uh what."
IfImLateDontWait,nba,1390277399.0,i am not sure we have a strategy right now
gingerkid1234,Christianity,1390277435.0,"&gt; Like, do Israelis in Israel hold counter rallies to these radical racist rallies that we see on the news?

What radical racist rallies have you been seeing in the news?  I'm sure they gather on occasion, but it's not as though dueling rallies are a common occurrence in most places, including Israel.

&gt;Is that a mis-characterization and Israel actually has a strong left and we just don't see it?

Israel's not much further right than a European country.  The important context is that they're involved in an armed conflict every few years.  It's very difficult to cultivate an anti-racist movement when a the country's also at war with the people who are most frequently the targets of racism.  Hell, how often are there anti-gypsy-discrimination protests in Europe?  I don't think ever that I've seen.

No serious person would claim there's no racism in Israeli society.  But the claim you're talking about is making expansive claims about Israeli racism being somehow more virulent than it is other places, which it really isn't, especially considering the context."

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1390278664.0,"&gt;Why aren't the Polish people viewed with discontent like the Nazi party in this pogrom?

First, it wasn't a pogrom--that's a specific sort of violence.  Second, it was mostly Germans killing people.  It was their infrastructure, their SS guards, etc.  While there were non-Germans involved (more heavily not in Poland, incidentally), it wasn't their governmental apparatus doing it.

&gt;For sure, some Polish Christians had to have been involved in the deaths of their Jewish countrymen. Who in Poland allowed this to happen?

Could you explain what you mean?  No one had to allow for someone to help the German government exactly.

&gt;Why did Hitler spend so much effort in eliminating Polish Jews and not German Jews?

Because of the placement of killing infrastructure where the Jews were in Poland, Polish Jews were close to ghettos and camps.  Additionally, many German Jews emigrated pre-war after the rise of Nazism--that didn't occur in Poland to the same extent."

I'm very happy with Master's, but Savon de Marseille is a better price and apparently even performs better. 

I would say it probably takes about one hour long episode of television to clean my brushes? What I do is I take a little container of water (the same thing Sweet Makeup Temptations does) to dip the brushes into wet them. Then, while watching television I swirl the brush in the soap and lay it down on a paper towel. If the brush is an eye brush, I do use a slightly textured surface such as the inside lid of the brush cleaner to remove any shimmer. After all the brushes are lathered, I take each one to swirl in the water (from the container I was using to wet them earlier) and squeeze the bristles before placing them back on the paper towel. I put them under the sink for a rinse to remove all traces of soap and then hang them to dry using hair elastics and a bar (I use the one on a globe in my room but a lot of people use a towel rack bar) so hair doesn't drip into the ferrule. 

I find this method is fairly painless except for needing to gather up all my brushes and take them into the living room and somewhat less water-wasting than standing in front of the bathroom sink which is what I did when I started out. "

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1390279274.0,"&gt;There is a disturbing trend I see with people. I'm not saying this is you, but this is the trend. Something negative is pointed out about their country/people, they don't say they are working against it, they don't even say there is strong opposition in their group against it, instead they compare themselves/their group to a country /people in worse shape and say, ""Hey, where not worse then them so where not that bad"" The length of something is dependent on the measuring stick.

The problem with Israel is that people spend lots of time and energy focusing on problems that are far worse elsewhere.  That doesn't make things in Israel right, it makes people who expend lots of time and energy on it either misguided or hypocritical (unless they live there, I suppose).  You mentioned people on the left universally condemning Israel--they're not bothering to condemn racism anywhere else.

&gt;Dehumanizing your enemy is not a good thing and most likely doesn't aid you in the battle, if that is what you are describing.

It's not an intentional strategy.  It happens naturally when you've only known a handful of Palestinians, and your main experience with them is Palestinian groups launching rockets at you, or blowing up buses in your town, or fighting with you in the army.  It's preposterous to pretend ethnic relations will be happy when there's been an armed conflict going on for generations--things are as good as one could possibly expect them to be.

&gt;I am claiming that that is how Israel is represented around the world, and if I don't, which I don't, want to claim that, what are the things stopping me?

I can't make sense of that sentence.  Are you looking for something like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C827im3LCWg)?"

I have a couple really close friends, but I could do with some more friends honestly. I have like 2 friends and a bazillion friendly casual acquaintances. I'd like to get closer with a few more women.

re:Tyrion: She had very damning evidence against him.  It wasn't an ""assumption"", it was a lie told to her by Littlefinger, a childhood friend who she had every reason to believe was trustworthy.  Taking Tyrion at the Crossroads Inn was the best option she could've had with the information available to her at the time.  If she didn't take him then, he would've just gone back to KL and been under the protection of the Lannisters.  Taking him at the inn, she can give him a trial by *her* terms, not Lannister terms.  She also had no idea that Lysa had gone batshit insane in the years since she'd last seen her, so she thought she was taking him somewhere safe.  You might want to check out [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1cd3fq/spoilers_all_catelyn_was_a_genius_for_making_that/).

Re: Jon Snow: Of course she hates Jon Snow.  Her husband comes back from the war with a bastard in tow, and she's supposed to just accept it and live as one big happy family?  Oh hell no.  She's got a lot of anger here and it's going one of three places: Her husband, the mistress, or the baby.  She can't hate the mistress because she has no idea who the woman is (so nowhere to direct the anger), and hating her husband will make every aspect of her life miserable, so the hate goes to the baby (and fwiw, she never physically or even verbally abused him, she basically just ignored him and excluded him- she could have done a hell of a lot worse).  You should also remember that it's really abnormal for a man to care for his bastard in this way in Westeros.  Robert Baratheon doesn't know that half of his exist, Roose Bolton ignored his until he was left without an heir, and Frey bastards are basically treated as servants to House Frey.  So why did Ned keep this bastard and raise him like a trueborn son?  Probably because he *really, really* loved the boy's mother (and Catelyn is not a subscriber to /r/asoiaf and has never read the R+L=J theories).

Re: Jaime: Yeah, I'll give you that releasing Jaime was completely irrational and all-around a bad move... however, the woman just heard that two of her kids were brutally murdered (again, she's not omniscient, so she doesn't know that Bran and Rickon are actually safe).  I think that you can cut a mother a little slack after hearing news like that.  Quite frankly, she should not have been left alone long enough to put her plan into action.

Some good ideas of Cat's: 

* It was her idea to go to Renly, which would've pretty much guaranteed victory for them if not for the unforeseeable death of Renly. 
* She organizes marriages between Freys and Starks/Tullys.  It's not her fault that her son threw the plan away and married Jeyne, and it's also not her fault that the Freys are lying assholes (the Freys are her father's bannermen, ffs, she shouldn't even have needed a marriage to cement their loyalty).
* She insists on eating bread and salt at the RW; she knows the Freys are untrustworthy, but how can she know that they're crazy enough to break guest right?  It's a 1000+ year old tradition!  It's been broken once in written history!  Wtf, Freys?
* When things go to shit at the RW, she's quick enough to grab Jinglebell as a hostage of her own (even if it's not a good hostage, she's smart enough to grasp for any bargaining chip she can get).

Sorry for any typos in this, I've already spent way too long on a single reddit post, and it's getting late!

This causes the coin pocket to lie flat and snug against the body. The front slash pocket on a pair of jeans is looser due to being lower in general, having a different height for each end of the pocket (introducing a vertical relief to oppose a horizontal tautness), and being cut with more material (with hands/keys/etc. being bigger than coins, and to account for flexibility in the hip joint, whereas there is no major point of articulation on the pelvis where the coin pocket lies).

So I know it happens... Maybe I just personally don't see it that much since I'm white. I'd bet that most people aren't racist, and that there is also some pro-black racism going on behind the scenes...

I guess there is still prejudice in America; even if most people don't believe in genetic differences between races anymore, people still make predictions and stereotype people based on their skin color when it's all there is to judge by.

It still seems like we could better combat those problems with more social change stuff that helps anyone in poor neighborhoods or bad circumstances: End the drug war, have free health care for everyone, etc. 

I don't think affirmative action is likely to help to even out the races' average income levels enough to eliminate prejudice, and the more affirmative action is in place, the more resentment might be spring up towards the people who are seen to benefit from it."

jjness,AskReddit,1390281408.0,"From Applied Cryptography, Bruce Schneier explains:

&gt;Longer key lengths are better, but only up to a point. AES will have 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit key lengths. This is far longer than needed for the foreseeable future. In fact, we cannot even imagine a world where 256-bit brute force searches are possible. It requires some fundamental breakthroughs in physics and our understanding of the universe.

&gt;One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)

&gt;Given that k = 1.38 × 10−16 erg/K, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2 Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2 K would consume 4.4 × 10−16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.

&gt;Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21 × 1041 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7 × 1056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.

&gt;But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1051 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.

&gt;These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.
The boldness is my own addition. 

Whether this still holds true or not, it's still an astounding thing to wrap your head around.

Personally, there are two things that always bugged me about the metric system, which have nothing to do with a preference for the imperial system.

If you take 1L of water, the mass of that liter is the most commonly used unit of mass in the whole metric system, and it is NOT the fundamental unit of mass in the metric system.  Why the fuck is that called a kilogram instead of a gram?  It's a much easier mass to visualize and get your head around than a gram.  (Edit) In the US, unless you're dealing drugs, you have no reason to ever deal in grams.  (Recipes are almost completely by volume here.)

If you take that same 1L and make a cube out of it, the size of the edge is a nice handy dimension.  In fact, it's on the same scale as our hands, and you could make a nice pocket ruler that length.  The name of this nice, convenient unit?  The Decimeter.  Most people have never heard of it except in math classes.  Why the heck is this not the basic unit of length?

If these two oddities were corrected, you'd have a beautiful, simple system:  

**1 Length^3 = 1 Liter (and for Water) = 1 Mass**

Instead you get 1 cm^3 = 1g, and 1m^3 of water = 1 tonne (which isn't even using the prefixes, but somehow gets a pass.)

Well as a person who over analyzes every situation (and has had some luckly had some success at finding a life where that is valued... but also... wait... is over analyse actually really supposed to be two words? I still kinda don't believe it after some googling but chrome says it is) I have to say that it sounds like your plight is not only of that of an cute girl (and I'm maybe other things? hate to assume) but you also sound like you're an INCREDIBLY quick thinker.  Like, I think I'm smart and I know I overthink (no, hang on google chrome spell check, I KNOW overthink is a word when its a verb... shouldn't overanalyze work the way.... baah damnit writing a response) but holy beejeezus how many seconds did that take to think??? Was he holding the door for an awkward long time as you walked up from a vast distance?? Assuming not, I have to follow up that as a man, who knows other smart men pretty darn well there so few of us (.something maybe? idk it has to be a tiny percentage) that would be able to do that in the time it takes to approach a doorway while also walking and looking at a girl at the same time.  I'm pretty sure the vast majority of those guys would REALLY like the prospect of getting to know someone like that.

Also yea, the whole bias against cute (and especially hot!) girls... it is reddit... sorry?  Of course the assumption on the part of reddit is always the attractive girl realized how attractive she is and often uses that to the her advantage over others.  Hope you don't take it in anyway (one word right? fuck now I knew that!

However, my dad left my mom for the first time in February of 2002, just before I turned 12 and I didn't see him for almost a year after that. My parents eventually reconciled and got back together for a few years until February of 2008 when my dad left my mom for the second time and she told him she wanted a divorce. I admit that my mom wasn't single for the majority of my life but she did most of the raising of my sister and I so I think I kind of fit into this category while not technically fitting in at the same time.

Anyway, I feel like I have a better understanding of women with not having my dad around all the time. I don't fully understand what being a woman is like, but from what I see around me day to day and read on the internet I understand what women go through a little bit better than most guys do in that I understand that when women go out at night, by themselves especially, there is a constant thought in the back of their mind that something bad could happen, which we men don't have to deal with. 

I've often wondered if children are better off without their parent of the same sex being around or if I was a unique situation.

As far as single mothers go, they are fantastic people and I wish them all the best because I don't know if I could handle being a single dad, especially with a kid as stubborn as I am. 

As far as dating goes though, I stay away. Not because there's anything wrong with single women with kids, but because I would hate to have things go really well, meet the kids and then the relationship goes south, leaving the kids wondering what happened to me leading to abandonment issues when they grow up."

Regarding the *what* you eat, it's a very common behavior of anorexics to eat a large volume of low calorie food as a way of both feeling full and staving off hunger, as well as disguising their restrictions from friends and family. For example, someone might eat one while cucumber. Or two. That is a ridiculous volume of food, something that would definitely have you feeling quite full, but only garnering about 65 calories total (and that's if you are *both* cucumbers, with the skin on). 

So to say that you only eat 400-500 calories while always feeling full points to either a medical issue that you should get checked out, or you're choosing unbalanced foods in your diet. "

Maldevinine,Fantasy,1390283090.0,"Boy, you know not what you are about to unleash.

**Debrie** by Jo Anderton. The main character is a magical architect who can reshape and rearrange matter to create structures. After a horrible ""accident"" at one of her sites, she finds herself unable to shape matter anymore and gets demoted to the magical equivalent of garbage collector.

**Born of Empire** by Simon Brown. A fantasy story with politics, hereditary magical power and the colonisation of lands across the seas. Set in an equivalent to the British and Dutch colonial era the story opens with a member of the ruling family outfitting an expedition to a new land across the seas to found a colony. He has been sent as punishment for failing to uphold the rules of the family.

**Feast of Souls** by Celia Friedman. You know how Abercrombie spends the whole first law trilogy making you hate all the wizards? Friedman pulls that off in 4 chapters. This is a dark and horrible story about the price of power.

**Goblin Adventurer** by Jim C. Hines. This is one of his first novels. A tribe of goblins lives in tunnels created long ago by a necromancer. The goblins are small, dirty, cowardly and evil. An Adventuring party enters the tunnels in search of fame and fortune, and captures one of the goblins to act as a guide. The book is his attempt to not die before getting back to the tribe.

**The Business of Death** by Trent Jamieson. An urban fantasy about death and the afterlife based in Brisbane, Australia. It's all about bureaucracy and helping souls move along. Some times they don't want to go, and other times things come back. There's a major problem with the metaplot, so don't read past the first book.

**A Secret Atlas** by Micheal Stackpole. A fantasy version of ancient China complete with invading Mongol hordes where magic is accessible to anyone who trains excessively in a single discipline. The story follows the family business of the best cartographers in the empire, with the two direct sons being sent away on voyages of discovery that could well kill them. And their deaths may be the intention. The book naming is a bit weird, but it does have the two greatest types of magic I have seen described in stories.

**The Crooked Letter** by Sean Williams. This is the most insane straight told fantasy story I know of. It's not humourous or meta, it just destroys reality as we know it in chapter 3. Because of this it is very hard to describe without spoilers, but I can say that it is a cosmic horror story, and the first of a series of 4 novels. If Sean knows why it's titled ""The Crooked Letter"", he hasn't told the rest of us."

Here's our new units, which can be converted to/from metric by simple translation, no math required:

1 franklin = 1 kilogram.  I weigh about 90 franklins.  A long ton is about 1kf or a metric ton.

1 lincoln = 10 cm.  I'm about 18 lincolns tall.  16kl is about a mile.  A marathon is about 422kl.  (That's a lower-case l.  Not to be confused with the uppercase L for that other unit.)

How patriotic would it be for us to honor those great Americans by putting their names into our units of measure?

And the rest of the world might hate us just a tiny, tiny bit less.

*This post is mostly a joke.  I think.  Or maybe my country is.  I can't tell any more.*

Edit:  Changes Jefferson to Lincoln, because why the hell not?

A liter is now a cubic lincoln, and if you fill it with water, it weighs one franklin.

**1L water = 1l^3 = 1 f.**

1l is about the height of 50 stacked pennies (all with Lincoln's face!)  8 stacks of pennies in a franklin.  We'll get this!

Actually what Israel does is worse then South African apartheid, when you consider their actions in the West Bank and the Gaza strip, and basically every interaction with the Palestinians since the official creation of the Israeli state.

The situation is different, granted, especially considering the greater severity of the overall situation-- but no one has said ""this is South Africa all over again"", which is something the pro-Israelis jump on whenever the word is brought up in context of Palestine.

&gt; disagree with you regarding Rwanda and the Holodomor, but that's not what we're talking about.

I disagree-- both the Rwandan Genocide and the Holodomor are equally heinous, regardless of someone one the internet worrying about how to classify them or otherwise dick-measuring when it comes down to how bad either one is.

Holodomor takes the cake for one of the most prolific instances of genocide through famine, and Rwanda for the largest number of people slaughtered brutally with melee weapons inside a specific period.

The drawback to silica though, while it is excellent at oil absorption (if you have dry/dehydrated skin I'd avoid this particular option) it causes flashback and therefore not the best option if you're going to be photographed regularly. 100% cosmetic grade silica can be bought from online retailers that provide raw ingredients and one popular option is TKB Trading.

RichAfterTaxes,ArcherFX,1390285716.0,"I'm surprised at how many people are against Archer Vice. Personally, I love it so far. 

To me, Season 4 was easily the weakest; I still enjoyed it and Ron Cadillac rules, but it definitely didn't feel as inspired overall. ""Live and Let Dine"" was basically just ""Skytanic"" with a mockumentary coat of paint; ""The Wind Cries Mary"" is nowhere near as awesome as an episode with Timothy Olyphant should have been; ""Sea Tunt Part 1"" felt like a clip show of running gags, with little else to offer. Etc. A few episodes - namely ""Midnight Ron"" and ""Viscous Coupling"" - were classics, but most were just in 7-8 territory. 

Tonight's episode, though, is my favorite in ages. Probably since S3's ""Lo Scandalo."" It really felt like Archer was firing on all cylinders again, and since Ramon was my favorite one-off character, it was great to see him again. Ron Perlman is terrific in that role. "
23skiddsy,pics,1390285757.0,"Mostly it has to do with the construction of the loops. With knitting, you have all your loops for your row (or tube, for circular knitting) that are pretty much straight in front of you, and a machine can handle that pretty simply (though it uses a different method than hand knitting). Crochet's method involves one loop on the hook at a time, and then you have to find by eye where you want to insert for drawing up a new stitch. It's hard for me to explain this in a way that makes sense to someone who doesn't knit or crochet, though. Crochet probably COULD be done by machine if you had a machine smart enough to find the proper place to insert the hook. 

There are machines that can produce crochet-LIKE material, but it's not true crochet. Just like most machines can't handle complicated [knit lace](http://www.futuregirl.com/craft_blog/images/2011/09/bluelace03_o.jpg).

Renner1,canada,1390285889.0,"&gt;  I think he takes issue with people conflating the state of Israel with Jews as a people.

Jewish and Zionist organizations are the primary people to look at when you talk about ""conflating the state of Israel with the Jewish people"".

It always seems to be ""Israel is the victim and the Palestinians are evil people who want to murder the Jewish people""-- outright lies and a spineless distortion of the main issue behind the Palestinian resistance organizations.

&gt; He points to the boycott of Jewish goods and stores in protest of actions of the Israeli state.

While shamelessly championing the widespread sanctions against Iran, and ""cautioning"" against diplomacy with any Iranian representatives. The man who ordered all Iranian diplomats to leave the country, remember?

If that's how we're playing the game, then I'm all for boycotting any Jewish products, especially ones that come from Israel. 

At least, until they stop chomping at the bit for total isolation of Iran/for others to attack Iran-- and actually try to do right by the Palestinians in terms of actually taking the supposed peace process at all seriously. A viable Palestinian state would be nice, with no Israeli stumbling blocks in the way.

&gt;  People often devolve blame on the people, not the state.

Again, look at the situation with the sanctions and boycott against Iran. Hilariously, many of the people who are rabid about the supposed evils of sanctions or boycott against Israel-- for its actions against Palestinians or occasionally the Lebanese-- will jump for joy at the idea of Iran under sanctions and boycott, and will advocate increasing the severity of sanctions against Iran at every opportunity.

A lot of ""Brown"" people are not considered nor accepted as citizens even if they were born there by the wider society hence why they have so many issues with immigration and integration. 


Well, in Western Europe, the guilty parties seem to think that anyone who isn't of Western European stock isn't a ""true"" citizen, or otherwise doesn't deserve to live in the Western European nation in question.

Arabs and Turks are still more or less ""white""-- but these quasi-Nazi groups (extolling at every opportunity that they love the Jewish people and therefore are immune from racism) don't limit their antipathy to the ""evil"" Arabs and Turks-- depending on where they live, they also hate the Romas, Slavs of most varieties, particularly Poles and Ukrainians, people from the Balkans, and then the actual ""Brown"" people like Pakistanis and Indians.

The worst part of it, to my mind, is that the majority of the people who come to Western Europe from these ethnic groups or racial subcategories definitely do have the ability to excel in their new countries and integrate fully-- facts that are denied by these delusional cretins, who'll take the very worst examples-- an instance of a criminal from Romania committing a crime in Britain, or someone from Algeria who turns out to be a latent Salafi Jihadi or a takfiri-- and then they, idiotically, try to claim that these people are all criminals or extremists or otherwise sub-par human beings or outright sub-humans.

Also the ball is easily passed down with a female which is nowhere near the difficulty level of shiny pokemon. 

I personally am okay with trading my genderless 1:1 because I have 5/6IV parents but I'm fine with offering 2:1 for someone else's genderless because they might not. It's ultimately up to the trader what they do and do not accept.

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390286844.0,"I'm no expert on consoles, but you could also consider that *because* the new gen of consoles are coming out you could get the previous gen for cheap and play all the classics. 

Personally, I'm a PC gamer through and through, but if I ever got a gaming system it would probably be the DS because there are so many titles that are exclusive to it that I'd be dying to play, particularly Fire Emblem and the Phoenix Wright games. 

I'd also consider investing in an XBox 360 controller! Either one with a cable or a wireless one with a wireless adapter so it will run with your non X-Box hardware. I used to scoff at controllers, but once I ponied up and got one it really opened up my eyes to new possibilities/opened completely different genres up to me. 

As for Ubuntu, well, steam for linux is pretty damn awesome. Check /r/linux_gaming !

Some games that run on Ubuntu/Mac that might be worth checking out (wait for them to be on sale though!): 

Minecraft: It's a social, co-operative experience and there's an /r/girlgamers server now, so maybe there's a chance that there'll be people willing to help you out in getting your feet wet :) It's also Java so it runs on everything. :D

Thomas Was Alone: Puzzle, story, interesting story telling, platformery (alternating protag) (controller not mandatory, but I would advise using one if you have one)

Gone Home: that indie darling, first person, 90s nostalgia short story thingie (female protag!)

Crusader Kings 2: Ok, on this I'd recommend watching a few videos first, I'd recommend the ones by Northernlion for example or the ones by quill18 (just search for them on youtube). It's a grand strategy game where you main view is staring on a map. You play as a dynasty of leaders starting around 1000 and you play one after the other, you have stats, you marry, you invade people, you change laws, you have random events that change your life, you have children, you raise them, you have them educated, you die eventually and then your heir takes over (and often has to fight all his siblings). If you manage to get that basque chain of female queens going, then you are really, really good. 

Bastion: Another one of those indie darlings, amazing music and a very interesting approach to storytelling through a narrator who believably reacts to you actions (would advice a controller for this as well)

I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream: if you have any patience for old adventure games. Do it for the story. 

Long Live The Queen, Portal if you have never played any, Fez (would only recommend it with a controller though) because it's so pretty and the puzzles are so deep, FTL if you have ever been a Star Trek fan (minimalist graphics, but oh so good), Trine 2 if you have a controller and ideally somebody who is willing to play with you (can be played with a child or niece/nephew), Forced (co-op play and runs on linux), Cook Server Delicious (just because), ShadowRun Returns (Ok, so that's a turn based RPG, but it's heavily influenced by this cyberpunk storytelling), you can also try out the big multiplayer free and linux compatible Valve games, Team Fortress 2 and Dota2. 

Ah, drats, there's just too many games out there :D Personally, I would say, just get steam for linux and/or steam for mac hooked up, then browse the search to check which linux/mac games have free demos and start with that. 

You can also check out the demo for [Long Live The Queen](http://www.hanakogames.com/llq.shtml) which is not on steam (I mean the game is, just the demo isn't). 

And give some thought to whether Minecraft is something you might want to jump into (since that isn't on steam either). "

There's also tip bots for Twitter that are very active, and there are a ton of faucets (Although less now with the price spike).

Not only that, but transactions for dogecoin have always been high, because it was never a currency that lent itself to speculation. So you'd have to subscribe to the idea that someone started their transaction bot a long time ago, with the idea that eventually it would pay off by creating the illusion of a false economy.

Not every word a person says is important. If someone had spoken the above paragraph in person I'd be looking into their eyes at these points:

Well, that's a random prediction, but the point is that you don't intensely stare someone in the eyes the entire time their talking. It's a natural response in most people, but when you're dealing with anxiety you start to overanalyze every small move. That's what used to make it hard for me.

This is it, really. The rest is basically riff raff in comparison. Nintendo really, really fucked up the launch window periods for both the 3DS and Wii U. The 3DS is recovering now, but the Wii U might not be as lucky. 

I think with the Wii U, they expected to coast on New Super Mario Bros. U for a while. By the time the system launched, though, the market was just kind of saturated with NSMB titles, and it's not the type of thing people want to buy a system for. If you didn't want that, your only other first-party options during the first half-year were Lego City, Sing Party and Nintendo Land. That's a decidedly lightweight lineup, and let's face it, people don't take third-party stuff into account when deciding whether or not to buy a Nintendo system. 

Nintendo really needed a Super Mario 3D World within the first month or two of launch. Hell, even a Pikmin 3 would have helped quite a bit. As it stands, it's difficult to imagine a worse possible launch.

He shouldn't talk to you critically in front of other people. If there is serious issue (none of these were serious ones) he should talk to you in private. Next time he gives you lecture -  just leave. He is so arrogant how perfect he is and he is feeling powerful when he gives you lecture. Don't let him abuse you anymore.  You are not child and don't deserve lectures. Whatever you mentioned were just minor things which didn't deserve any critique.
sandmans,destinyknot,1390288100.0,"I'm not questioning your value system even though I don't agree with some of what you said. The point is you're perfectly fine to trade the togepis and scyther however you want. And you should extend the courtesy to other people and not just straight ban one thing and not the other. 

For instance, to get a certain ball such as moon, apicot, love, you must catch a female pokemon in black/white/diamon/pearl/emerald/whatever and transfer it up all the way to X/Y. 

Edit: sidenote, defog scythers are extremely easy to get, I regularly give them away on /r/pokemongiveaway when I see someone asking for one. Again just different value systems and trading styles."

midgaze,stopdrinking,1390288145.0,"Anxiety and depression are very typical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol feels like it's making it better, but really you are probably in a self-perpetuating downward spiral. When I stopped drinking, I was not expecting my brain chemistry to heal itself like it did. I was just noticing driving home from the store tonight, how relaxed and comfortable I felt. I never used to feel that way, except in a halfway there way with a bunch of booze in me. I was always anxious around people, depressed when I wasn't drinking, depressed when I was, hating myself for punishing my body the way I did. Bloated up from all the extra calories, skin all blotchy all the time. Things get so much better when you stop drinking! You really should do it, it's the hardest thing I've ever done but it's well worth it. It sounds like you need to get into rehab pronto.

That means: pick up the phone, dial your parents, and tell them you need to go to rehab because you need to stop drinking before it gets any worse. Tell them you need their help finding a place and getting there."

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390288178.0,"Trine 2 might be a good start, since you won't run into any camera control issues (2 and a half d, puzzle platformer with very story book pretty graphics). Same for Civilization 5. You could even try [a MOBA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOXFWRF06ug). That said, MOBAs can be pretty stressfull, even if you just practice against bots. Magicka could be interesting if you have that one (It's also like in a zillion bundles so it should be really cheap) or [Path of Exile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8779Ff_qoc) (which is a Diablo style free to play game which you can play through together =&gt; if hack and slash is something you might like you could also try Torchlight 2 (cute graphics, I hear it goes over well with girlfriends) or Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing (if the story/setting appeals to you). 

You could also start with some smaller games, like [Towerwars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBZQUZriQfo) (a versus Tower Defense game), [Starbound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MZn_fqpqkk) (2d, digging+crafting focused), [Ticket To Ride](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6G0QThoFFI) (PC adaption of an award winning board game). 

=&gt; I mostly focused on games that all don't have any first or third person camera 

If you want her to get used to first person stuff, Potal 2 might be a good place to start, it's a first person puzzle game with a co-op mode. Minecraft on a relatively peaceful server could be an option as well. As for WOW-likes, a friend of mine who was away from gaming for quite a while recently started playing Neverwinter with her boyfriend and they seem to be enjoying it (I believe they sampled a bunch of the f2p MMOs and they seemed to have found Neverwinter the most useful to their taste/the best to combine with the working lifestyles [she wasn't a gaming newbie though, but an ex-WoW player]).

I addressed this in another comment, but *not* dropping ones still sets a character *well* above average. The problem with dropping ones is that it results - to my mind, I mean! - in heroes that are too powerful *across the board*, and with very little likelihood of real flaws. With the system you use, there's close to a *50% chance* that a character will have *no* stats below *11!* And the average stat is nearly *thirteen and a half*. Where a character with one 16, much less an 18, in *anything* is certainly heroic (especially given that you're obviously going to play to that stat as a strength) even if they also have an 8 in there somewhere and a couple of 10s, the Fighter that's 18/12/16/11/10/10 is a powerhouse right off the bat and has *no* weaknesses, nothing she's just bad at. 

And I mean, totally I get the draw of playing characters that are super-powerful legends, and that's totally valid - but for me, the place for that is, I don't know, around level 16 or 20? At which point that 16 you put into Strength is now a 21 (well outside the mortal realm) *before* considering your Gauntlets of Crushing Absolutely Everything and your Amulet of Profound Strengthliness.

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1390290013.0,"What you do is kind of up to you. If it hurts too much to be around him but not with him then get out of there. If you really want to try to win him over then do so but be prepared for him to move out and possibly get a restraining order (the line between winning somebody over and acting crazy enough to seem dangerous is so thin that it may not even exist, if you saw it in a romcom then it's probably a bad idea). There are more options but this is just a bad situation.

Move out if you think it's best, we can't really answer that for you.

No, the stigma is because it's dangerous. If both parties fall for each other and stay together or never develop emotions then it's fine but anything else is bad. A bad breakup results in people who hate each other living together, unrequited love ends up with what you're dealing with. Similar reasons for avoiding hooking up with people you work with.

We can't read his mind, I could probably answer it if I knew him but that's a rare skill. He could be scared that things won't work so he doesn't want to try. He may only like you as a friend but thinks you're attractive. The way you described his behavior is really conflicting, I'd say assume he isn't into you (the crush thing is a big hint and if it isn't then it would be a red flag, people who play mind games like that are not relationship material).

Some guys can't some guys can, same with girls. If you take a look at culture and the way we're socialized then you'll see some things which result in some interesting trends in how attachments form. Guys are taught to suppress most emotions and be stoic at all times, thus many of us do not form romantic attachments through physical means as we don't feel as if we're opening up to somebody that way. Instead we form attachments through shared experiences and emotions, if we can talk to you about anything, if we can express the emotions we don't show in public and be what society declares to be weak in front of you then you're loved (it may simply be strong platonic love). Girls are taught to be emotional and form deep connections, they're taught (just as we are) that male sexuality is predatory and that sex is something that happens to them, not a mutual act (part of this mentality tends to hold but not all of it). The result is that a lot of girls will either develop strong emotional connections as a result of sex or only have sex if they feel that connection. Essentially many men can be keep sex and love separate but not emotional openness and love while many women are the opposite (I'm one of the lucky ones that can do neither, the combination of my neurology and my past is not fun).

Fuck if I know, when I fall for somebody I fall hard and it kind of hurts. So far I've just waited until I get used to the pain, still waiting. I kind of miss the days when I didn't really feel, I wouldn't want to go back to it but still.

I know you said not to say it but you are stupid but that's kind of what being human is. You can follow your heart or your head (or rather be lead by one, good luck figuring out which is guiding you at any moment), they rarely agree and more often than not both are wrong. Everybody makes the occasional mistake and now your goal is to get through it, then you can work on making it better and learning from it. Nothing sucks quite as much as life but it's more than worth all the pain for those moments of joy, things will get better."

It's long lol.
  
This weekend some friends and I went on vacation. I look &lt;20 years old and this nasty creep GUY (30+) came in the pool area where there are alot of kids playing and started basically following me around. At first, I thought he just wanted a conversation even though it was obvious I was resting, with my eyes closed, in the lazy river. But then when I moved to the other pool to practice swimming, he came too. And at that time, he asked if I ""twerked"" and if I drink ""drinky drinks and come to his room #"". (My friend clarified that is what he said later on when he repeated the phrase with her there. I couldn't really hear him) It was 10 minutes of him near me at the pool and me not being able to practice swimming because he was all up on me. When my friend came, thank God for her, he was still there, bothering us. We moved back to the lazy river area. He FOLLOWED us out of the pool and came near us then propositioned us again to drink up in his room. Then that friend went back to the room, and I wanted to stay to keep my other friend safe in the pool. When that other friend and I attempted to leave for good, she saw him watching our moves and he actually got out of the pool from where he was swimming alone when he saw us make the move to leave. She told me this, and then we acted like were doing swimming exercises on the wall and didn't get out. 10 seconds later after walking around aimlessly he comes into the pool again. Then, again we attempt to leave, he does the same thing and leaves the pool. It was a freaking game, but eventually we left when the coast was clear. 

I really wish I would've told him off and report to someone that this creep was bothering us, but it seems that I still have this mental block in my head that ""he's lonely and sad. Maybe he doesnt know he's crossing the line"". But, then when I want to puke from that unwanted proximity with someone then regardless of his intentions, there's a definite problem. I just need to stop being a coward and speak up for myself. "

good sex with us lasts around ten minutes, we do switch up positions a few times. longer if its a good oral session

The necromancer gives you better long-term value though as he's capable of outputting damage *while* giving sweeper protection, unlike the Charm which is burn-4 OR stop a verdict.

They said they needed 100 points of ID. Fair enough. They gave me a handy list of the points system, and I discovered I do not have 100 points of ID. How can this be? I have easily had 100 points of ID for my bank, for centrelink, for a health insurance issue, etc. How do I now not have 100 points? So I google it, and it turns out the real estate agent just MADE UP this system. There's legislation which determines what is 100 points of ID, it's not something you can just pull out of your arse, but that's what they did. My birth certificate is apparently only worth 20 points, my license only 10. I'm pretty sure it's bullshit to just make that up, and then tell me it's the legal requirement for renting a fucking room. Everything was worth so few points that I needed to give them every piece of information about my life, every card, every statement, every document.

travelingmama,Parenting,1390295473.0,"Conflicts like these can be solved very easily with proper communication. Punishment and consequences are completely unnecessary and counteractive. By punishing them you are taking their problems on as your own instead of allowing them to take responsibility. When a child acts out they are communicating a need or a feeling to you. So first you decode that message in a non-judgmental way by actively listening and not passing judgments. So a quick example would be if you ask them to clean their room while they're playing a video game and they whine. You'd say something like, ""it sounds like you really don't like when I ask you to clean in the middle of your game."" They will feel like their message was clear and you understood their frustration. That's called active listening. Then you can communicate your feelings through an I message, ""I feel really frustrated when your room is not clean because things get broken."" Or whatever your true feelings are. Then you can propose a win-win situation. My son is 5 so we just straight up say, ""what can we do so we both win?"" And he will usually propose something that's a win for him and we'll say ""but if you do that then I don't win. How can I win too?"" and he'll try again and if he doesn't figure it out, I'll propose something. In this case it would be, ""how about you get to play the game until you finish this part and then you can go clean your room?"" 

Anyway, this is a very extremely brief explanation on what is taught in the book Parent Effectiveness Training and it has completely TRANSFORMED our house. There are 3 main parts and that is the active listening where you decode your child's real message and real feelings without giving a solution (you let the child own their problems this way), then there is the I-message where you own your problem and communicate your real feelings about the situation which does wonders in modifying a child's behavior because the guilt they may feel for making you feel a certain way is a natural consequence, and then there is the negotiation. There is also a section on modifying your environment to prevent future conflicts. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this book. Especially if you're looking for a non-violent solution. This gives your child more responsibility and is a million times more effective at modifying behavior peacefully and it's non-manipulative. It's just the best way to communicate with EVERYONE!! It has helped my husband and my relationship as well! "

It would have been easy for me to manage without the student loan if I had the discipline to not party as much and work on summers/weekends, in fact I had several friends who did that and came out the other end loan-free.

* **It is not a planeswalker ability** *(read: Xenagos +1)*
* **When it resolves, it could add mana to a player's mana pool** *(COULD is a relevant word - Nykthos's second ability is a mana ability even without any creatures out)*

However, as I have gotten older (I'm 27, so when I say as I've gotten older, I don't mean like 30's or 40's older) I've come to the realization that our generation has so much more information than past generations. To truly compare ourselves to older generations we will have to wait until we are older to find out the difference. They didn't have the same temptations and hangups as we do now and are quick to judge the way we rely on social media and technology because it wasn't something they had to deal with. But I think with this exposure to so much knowledge at our fingertips, we will be a more thoughtful generation. I've had a home birth, I homeschool my kids, I have strong political beliefs, and care way more about things than my parents ever did or ever thought to care about, they just did what everyone told them to because the research wasn't at their fingertips. All of these things I've done I have done massive amounts of reading up on. So my point is that even though you may be in a time in your life where you are apathetic, when you do start to get curious or start to settle down, you'll be able to go beyond the level of the older generations.

* again, this is still a comparison of two competing products. if product 1 had feature X and it's competitor, product 2, does not have feature X, shouldn't you be justified in rating product 1 with a better review than product 2? this is all in the name of helping people figure out which product they should buy. on an otherwise equal playing field, you absolutely want the product with feature X.

Nowadays, the state of the field when it comes to getting honest reviews and impressions of new games that are backed by big publishers like EA and Activision is downright pitiful. It has gotten to the point where I don't have any truly trustworthy go-to reviewers that I can rely on other than maybe AngryJoe for game reviews and Boogie for impressions of consoles and various topics in the gaming industry as a whole, which is pretty sad considering there used to be a plethora of gaming journalists who provided well thought out and thoroughly argued opinions on various topics in gaming on a regular basis.

greeklemoncake,magicTCG,1390297350.0,"From the Comprehensive rules:

&gt; 702.33a Flashback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that functions while the card is in a player's graveyard and the other that functions while the card is on the stack. **""Flashback [cost]"" means ""You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost""** [...]

Now, this means that your Force of Will now looks like this:

&gt;Force of Will 3UU  
Counter target spell.  
You may pay 1 life and exile a blue card from your hand rather than pay Force of Will's mana cost.  
You may pay cast this card from your graveyard by paying 3UU rather than paying its mana cost.

""What you are trying to do here is apply two effects that provide an alternative cost to cast the spell, and the rules say only one such alternative cost can be applied to any single spell.

Sometimes the method of casting the spell requires you to choose a particular alternative cost, and Flashback is one of those abilities. The last sentence of 601.2b says this. Previously made choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard or choosing to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the player’s options when making these choices.

Thus since you must apply the Flashback cost you can't also pay 1 life and exile a blue card in hand.""

Every time I would get up to take my turn, I was very careful to not turn around just in case.

I got home that night and realized I bled through.. a *lot*. Like, the whole backside of my shorts were red. They were denim. Anyway, I texted the owner of the apartment and said a very awkward ""I'm so sorry if I bled on your floor. I'll clean it up. I'm so sorry. This is awkward."" She replied and said it was cool, no blood. Thank fucking god. I was tripping.


Another time I rode in the back of a friend's car (more like a friend of a friend again, I was into him though) and I bled all over the seat. It was tan leather. Luckily it was a large SUV with many seats and I was in the very back where it's really dark. I'm just assuming I bled on it, cause I definitely bled through that time too, but I couldn't see it.

tugabros,battlefield_4,1390300169.0,"Zavod 311 Rush: in the first set of MCOMs, protecting the entrances to B with a MG with a bipod is sweet. Also, the top of the buildings is an epic place in conquest to use the bipod.

Operation Locker: after the first set of MCOMs, there's a yellow tinted area. If you're a defender, lie on the ground, bipod out, kill everything. (in conquest it's like... objective A to B or E to D).

Paracel Storm: when you see a boat, get down, bipod out, kill driver/minigunners.

Dawnbraker: The zone near the bridge has very good depolayble spots, because enemies run out in the open and it's easy to take them out.

Well, I only got those, off the top of my head, but the general gist is this: if you're in an open area, and they come in pairs, deploy perpendicular to their path. If they come full-on assault, deploy right in the end of their path. If it's a closed area, the amount of enemies is not important, so deploy, again, in the end of their path. You can calculate the enemies' path by knowing the general area around you.

Also, be mindful of entryways/open areas that are at your side. Someone can easily flank you from there, make sure you can't be flanked.

Hope that helped, cheers!

Please note that this is a GHz version, should consume a bit more than the regular one.

This test was done with a hungry CPU Intel Core i7-3960X @ 4.3GHz - and it only draws 100W on idle (with 1 card), the idle wattage for GPU is often said about ~10W; so let's say each VGA will requires 170W;

So... doing the math, 170*3 + 100 = 610 Watts. Giving some fat to burn (also it's good to keep your regular usage around 60-80% to get better [efficiency](http://lfcarmona.com/media/hx850-efficiency-chart.gif) per price) - your this HX850 is defintely a good choice! 

----
After a did the math, grab the links, and all stuff, I found this article from Guru3D:
http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_radeon_hd_7850_and_7870_review,7.html


Measured power consumption R7870 

* System in IDLE = 157W
* System Wattage with GPU in FULL Stress = 274W
* Difference (GPU load) = 117W
* Add average IDLE wattage ~10W
* Subjective obtained GPU power consumption = **~ 127 Watts** ^(My first math is based on GHz version - not bad!)

TL;DR:. 750-850 watts is a good choice. go for it

Laundry loaded into the machine/vacuum cleaner run 'round the house/dishes clean (though obviously don't do anything without asking first). Holding the baby while I go for a quick shower. All of these things are lovely, just a brief moment to myself. Her father was okay, but he's a student and is at university 150 miles away, and he went back 8 days after her birth (he's missed a lot as a result). I missed having that support, but I guess your friend won't have problems like that.

* Take cooked food/snack food over. She'll love you forever.

* Don't ask too many questions if she doesn't want to talk about her experience yet - I don't know your friend or her personality, but I really resented the floods of intimate questions I wasn't ready to answer (delivery wasn't totally straightforward, neither was breastfeeding and it's still a bit painful for me to think about)."

Until I was 27-28, I thought I was asexual. I have been in a long term, not-very-sexual relationship with a girl I really love. We were from an extremely sex-negative background. This had the effect that no parents or friends think anything about lack of sex, so it doesn't seem out pf place. 

Of almost all the sexual stuff we did, dry humping, oral and ultimately intercourse, I enjoyed pleasuring her, but did not desire anything fo myself. 

A few years ago I got my autism diagnosis, and started therapy for chronic depression, lack of motivation and related problems. My first therapist kept focusing on me being in touch with my emotions, as I had no idea what I was feeling most of the time. After a year of therapy, something awakened in me. I started feeling something that was drwing me to other women, and accompanied by a sexual drive.

I am not really familiar with this new drive yet and trying to figure out what to do with it. I don't know if it was already there and I wasn't aware of it, or it emerged as a new thing. I just know it is there now, probably to stay.

Spending all this silver was bankrupting the British so they started importing opium from India to get the Chinese middle class addicted, so they would then trade tea for opium.

When the Chinese government (under the Qing dynasty) tried banning opium due to it's detrimental affects on their society (not unreasonably!), the UK declared war and basically wiped the floor with them. The end result was a series of VERY unfair treaties, essentially opening up the whole of China to foreign trade (whereas before they were very isolationist), and made opium legal, enabling the trade of opium to skyrocket. Not to mention the Chinese had to cede territory to the UK (i.e. Hong Kong) which was only returned in 1997, pay an extortionate amount in ""reparations"" and gave Christians full Chinese civil rights including the right to own land and evangelise..."

Basilgate,WritingPrompts,1390306735.0,"The woman rowed, and the girl watched. 

“Eat,” the woman said.

The girl reached into the leather sack by her feet and pulled out a cracker. She gnawed on it absently.

The going was slow through the dense fog, but the black river was calm. Mosquitoes and gnats fussed around the woman’s face. She couldn’t bat them away, she had to keep rowing. A rusty old lantern, hanging off a hook at the bow, squeaked and whined with every stroke of the oars. Its faint light did little to part the gloom.

“We’re almost there,”

“Okay.”

She’d been saying that for a while now. The truth was she had no idea how close the village was, but she knew they had to reach it before nightfall. There was little sound other than the soft, steady splash of the oars against the water, and the creaking of the lantern. The woman could just made out the heavy reeded bank, off to the left through the mist. She dared not imagine what silent horrors watched them from the darkness there. She kept her distance.

“Something’s here,” the girl said.

“There’s only us.”

The woman felt her heart racing and she closed her eyes, trying to calm herself. The monsters here could smell fear, drinking it up like nectar. Something tapped on the side of the boat. The woman cursed, breathing deep, trying to stay calm. It was no use.

“What is it?”

“It’s nothing. Just keep your eyes on me, okay. Just stay with me.”

A black, oily tentacle uncoiled from ahead of them. The girl had her back to it but the woman could only stare straight at it as it waved obscenely at her. More tentacles rose up, hovering around the girl’s head. They made no noise, and she didn’t seem to notice them.

“Keep your eyes on me.”

Her voice wavered. Her traitor mind flashed images of the girl dragged screaming into the cold black water. Her fear rose, and with it, a terrible face from the gloom. It’s blank fish eyes staring, hungry. It’s gaping mouth terribly human.

*** (Got to 350 words here) ***

It was no use, she was terrified now. Letting go of the oars, she jumped up and grabbed the charm from around her neck and held it in the air. A violent light burst forth, pulsing out and then dimming in an instant to the shriek of the recoiling beast. The woman sat back down with a gasp, causing the boat to rock gently. The girl rubbed her eyes.

“What happened?”

The woman was weak. Her vitality sacrificed for their safety. Using the charm again would surely kill her.

“Nothing. It’s okay,” she said. “We’re almost there.”

“Okay.”

The woman rowed on through the fog. Breathing slowly."

heffalump232,unitedkingdom,1390306849.0,"I wish this comment was higher, because you could replace Saddam with Nasser or Gadaffi and it would still ring true.

The whole Middle East political dilemma is just one big power struggle. The official governments and regimes, the Sunni and Shia fundamentalists, the PLO, the Muslim Brotherhood which has been a threat to Egypt since its full independence, and at one time the Irgun in Palestine, all want their own territory and their wealth, because who doesn't like money and power?

Meanwhile, the western powers and USSR/Russia, are hellbent on making sure they get their own share. And thus, they end up supporting vicious regimes, getting rid of said regimes, and other factions leap at the opportunity of said downfall. It's why people like Nasser, Gadaffi, the Assads, and the Husseins manage to stay in power for prolonged periods of time. 

What people have to realise is that there is no moral high ground to be had, because some faction or group has already flattened it. The saying ""In every revolutionary, there is a tyrant waiting to escape"" is appropriate in this context. 

And this situation hasn't been resolved in the last 100 years, starting from the fall of the Ottomans, and it won't be resolved in the next 100. Sadly, none of us will be around when historians finally start to write its narrative."
