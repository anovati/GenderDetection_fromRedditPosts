shoryukenist,europe,1389127547.0,"This is very interesting to me.  In the late 90s I studied in London, and dated a girl from the Alicante region.  She was Catalan, and HATED the central Spanish state, and anyone from Madrid.  Her parents were very angry (understandably) about not being able to speak Catalan under Franco.  So I learned all about this stuff, and always had a feeling that Madrid was forcefully holding a group of people together that didn't really want to be together.  At that time, Basque separatism was more active I believe.  

Anyway, in a way I'm not surprised this stuff is happening, though I never in a million years would have guessed that there would be a vote for Scottish independence.  Didn't see that one coming!"

You would imagine that if Levy brought it up to LVG then he would have brought it up to Sherwood. If that's the case, why even bother naming Sherwood the full-time manager?

However, it didn't work for me.  Your brain is amazingly good at forgiving yourself for slipping up on your goals.  In fact, I think some people get off in some weird way for finding excuses for not doing the things they want/need to do.

This is what works for me:

1) **Want it badly** - this is hard.  Most people are in love with the *idea* of being in shape or the *idea* of learning to play the guitar.  You have to be in love with *what it takes to achieve these things*.  This leads to my next point:

2) **Be painfully honest with yourself**.  Imagine getting in shape.  Imagine that you have to love going to the gym many days per week so much that you watch the seasons change.  It has to *become* part of you.  I find that people approach something like going to the gym without willing to make the sacrifices necessary.  Your identity has to change.  You have to be ""the gym guy"".  You might have to give up playing video games to go to the gym.  *be willing to change yourself*.  You also have to:

3) **Love the pursuit, not the end result**.  This is also hard.  Fake it until you become it.  I mention to people how I love the muscle soreness I get from the gym.  I mention how learning piano is kicking my ass but I'm also kicking its ass slowly over time.  Love what you're doing *right now*, even if it's studying or working out, and it's much easier to do these things.  Finally:

4) Remind yourself **constantly** about why your good choices are better for you than the bad habits that you might otherwise default to"

ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1389127843.0,"This article is idiotic. Grammar Nazis circlejerk about Orwell's *Politics* and missed the point completely. Orwell didn't think bad grammar was the problem at all. What he thought was the problem is *imprecise,* weasely, meaning-free, truthy language. 

Every single example in this article is stupid:

&gt; Different to? This makes me nuts.

There is *absolutely no* semantic difference between ""different to"" and ""different from."" It is not less precise.

&gt; Forty percent less fat, thirty percent less calories.

Calories are an *abstract measure.* It's like saying ""less volts."" It's not the preferred usage but neither volts nor calories are real objects so the difference is extremely trivial. ""Less photons"" would be wrong, ""less cells"" would too, but *neither* fit Orwell's point anyway - they're not imprecise, they can only mean one thing and that thing is clear.

&gt; Does anyone on these websites know the difference between you’re and your? There and their?

Again, usage issues. There's a reason people make this mistake - because the words *sound exactly the same and yet no one misunderstands the difference in spoken language.* I have never, ever seen a case of this where I could possibly misunderstand which word they meant.

The difference personally bothers me because making the distinction is not difficult and it implies laziness of thought. But that's the way I live *my* life - for strangers on the internet, that just informs me to ignore them.

&gt;  on punctuation and its placement.

Punctuation can change the meaning of the sentence. She picked an example where it was meaningless and just a placeholder for certain spoken conventions.

People write the way they speak, which is wrong, but the meaning is no different.

&gt; I’m “well educated”

The hyphenation means nothing in this case. You could stack extra descriptors on and then they would to ""educated"" without the hyphen and ""well-educated"" with. In this case, the parentheses serve the same purpose as the hyphen. In addition, being well-educated does not make you a good grammatist; physics doctorates, in my experience, either make numerous errors or are very obsessive about editing because they used to make numerous errors.

&gt; my dog’s diet has too little vitamins.

This is actually *more precise* than saying ""too few."" ""Too few vitamins"" might mean you dog has enough B and K, but no D - a number of distinct vitamins. ""Too little vitamins"" means your dog is not getting enough of B and/or K and/or D - the category of vitamins. In either case, some context would make the meaning totally clear despite which word you picked. There's no ambiguity when there's context, which you would have in reality.

&gt; His bugbear was the debasement of the language thanks to dead metaphors, familiar phrases, euphemism, and vagueness. But I think bad grammar is equally dangerous.

Because, my dear, you are an idiot.

For the author and people like her, grammar is a placeholder for education, intellectual care, familiarity with the language, and class. It has nothing to do with clarity, it's just that within her own mind she's distinguished *correct* and *incorrect,* as hammered in by English teachers.

And that's just swell. I also like people who don't make egregious grammar errors. But I'm not clutching my copy of Orwell and screaming. I can make a certain distinction for intent and meaning - I think about language like an adult and not an elementary school student."

I didn't even know it was possible to live together without being primaries. I thought living together was one of the things (with being married, having children, sharing finances) that decides whether a relationship is primary or secondary.

I'm confused.

I'm sorry you're hurting so much. I guess you have two options: end the relationship because it doesn't work for you, or find a way to make it work.

Finding a way to make it work can involve moving out and having a secondary relationship with her, or seeing if the three of us can get along in a way that doesn't make you feel neglected and left out (which would require work on both of their parts as well).

At any rate, I think the three of you need to have a serious talk about it. Right now it looks like she made decisions and sprung them on you instead of everyone making decisions together and seeing what works for all of you."

GuyWithNoHat,sex,1389128497.0,"Here's a few things that my wife and I tried (with success):

* Shower together, not just occasionally -- every day.  NOTE: This is not about having sex in the shower, but building intimacy and feeling close.  Being washed can be quite titillating, though, and is quite nice!

* Be concerned about one another.  For instance, if my wife works out, or is on her feet all day, I'll *tell her* to give me her feet so I can massage them for a while.  This usually happens on the couch while watching some TV.

* If you have confidence issues, what better way to alleviate the nervousness than to give her no-strings-attached pleasure?  Touch her, tease her, practice pleasing her.  Make sure to ask for feedback, and adjust accordingly.  Record her commentary in your mind for future reference.

* Ask if she has any interest in non-vanilla activities.  Many women are interested in having a dominant partner, is your wife?  If so, explore the idea with her, even if you aren't that interested.  You may find something you like that you dismissed before.

The critical thing is to *keep trying*.  Try subtle things.  Ask yourself, ""How is she feeling? What little thing can I do to make her day better?"" I know it's cliché, but I started putting notes in my wife's lunch.  Sometimes sexy, sometimes nostalgic, sometimes just a profound quote or memory.

Above all, ask for feedback and communicate.  Encourage her to join in your search for intimacy.  Share things that you would love, use sentences like ""I think it would be great to do X"" or ""I always wondered what it would be like to Y"".  Yes they're hints, and no they aren't very subtle, but if you promise to listen to each other you can start to build a stronger bridge between the two of you."

It was the most popular of many travel guides created around that time, more or less. Here is some info from the [Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World):

&gt; The Seven Wonders of the World (or the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) refers to remarkable constructions of classical antiquity[1] listed by various authors in guidebooks popular among the ancient Hellenic tourists, particularly in the 1st and 2nd centuries BC. The most prominent of these, the versions by Antipater of Sidon and an observer identified as Philo of Byzantium, comprise seven works located around the eastern Mediterranean rim. The original list inspired innumerable versions through the ages, often listing seven entries. Of the original Seven Wonders, only one—the Great Pyramid of Giza, the oldest of the ancient wonders—remains relatively intact.

It's a travel guide from ancient history that went viral over the years. Imagine if a Travelocity article about ""eight best hotels to celebrate the New Year"", after several civilization upheavals, became one of the few sources about our tourism industry, and became known as the ""The Eight Sacred Lodgings for Completing the Annual Cycle"""

I try to qualify my statements and wasn't claiming in the first posting that no exploitation is going on. Just that it isn't 'strictly' exploitation as there's a range of possibilities and it's not inherently an exploitative construct. Though patriarchal or matriarchal households seem to always be through dependency, perhaps violence/abuse and dominance hierarchy. Some households however are true partnerships, though that seems to be less common than one would hope.

Generally speaking though, being a pure homemaker seems to me a bad idea as does being purely a 'breadwinner' as both are quite prone to exploitation. Equal partnership in and out of the home seems to me a far better situation."

Just try to develop a good feel for when people like meeting new people and when they don't. If she's actively busy or seems really stressed, then maybe that's not the best time.

Also, don't try to use the class a means to manipulate her into doing something else. It's scummy. If you want to study for an exam or something, then actually study together. You can get to know each other in and around studying together, but if she shows up thinking you're going to study and instead finds soft lights and no books in sight, then that's not good."

ciov3r,changemyview,1389128798.0,"Exactly. 

The most obvious impacts to consider in your case would be land use, water use, concentrated animal waste and gases, and animal feed for the birds.

- Land use. Deforestation is an obvious problem with ALL agriculture. However, unless you're ruthless about keeping other species off of your land, grazing land isn't 100% detrimental, and can even be beneficial for species such as deer, birds, certain small mammals, etc.

- Water use. Again, water use and irrigation has a pretty big impact in all areas of agriculture... plant and animal. Taking measures such as collecting rain water/etc can help.

- Feed for animals. If your beef is grassfed, and you aren't putting out insane chemicals into the grass, then it goes back to land use. If you're giving your birds feed, that's something to consider- but free-range birds can often self sustain during most of the year.

- Animal waste. If properly managed, animal waste can be both environmentally helpful and can be used for other products and in the garden. 

All of this goes back to being responsible. Not being animal-product-free."

She suddenly went weirdly limp. Scared the F**K out of me. 

I lowered her to her knees while I tried to fight off the worst panicky feeling I've ever had in my life. her eyes were glassed out and she wasn't there even as she looked at me. Then her self slowly crept back in.. creepy as hell, but relieving. 

and it seems it was at a weird edge too, because she says she remembers seeing etc, but not thinking or anything. So the recording mode was on, but there was no processing. No awareness.

I do 5 mins warmup, 10 minutes focusing on some aspect of form/technique (every week I focus on a different aspect), apply that to 10 minutes of sprints, and then 5 mins cool down. I have been able to stick to this for a while now because swimming is just a lot of fun for me and it's the only cardio activity that I look forward to doing every day. Also, the ~1 hour total commitment a day isn't asking very much time wise. Doing this with a relatively conscious diet, I've lost ~50 lbs in the past year and a half and have been keeping it off.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389129265.0,"Everyone is broadly right that it has to do with copyright law.

Who owns a song/video/etc. in each jurisdiction is not necessarily the same.  So company A produces some content.  Company B gets the right to distribute it in the US, company C gets the right to distribute it in the UK.  

Driving page views from the UK to company B via youtube is coming at the expense of Company C.  Company A only really cares about the contract enforcement, they might get roughly the same either way.  

But in this scenario companies B and C are usually big outfits, they're the ones who ultimately fund all of the creation activities, and  they have paid a lot of money and collect a lot of money to be be their own fiefdoms.  

Part of why those Companies aren't always the same company is because different countries have different laws and different regulations, and companies bring different connections and skills to the market.  Copyright being different is a big issue.  Imagine that in one country copyright lasted 50 years and in another country it lasted 100.  Buying the rights to something for the duration of the copyright is then worth quite a bit more in one place than another.  If you then lose out on revenue to someone who only bought it for 50 years it means you're losing money.

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389129420.0,"Examples of creepy female behavior that I have personally witnessed or heard of from real people I know:

* Getting into a guy's personal space, repeatedly, when he obviously didn't want her there
* Making up dates, encounters, or entire relationships about a guy and then casually telling those stories to other people (as in, ""Oh, you know David? He and I used to totally have a thing, but I broke his heart and now it's awkward"" when in fact they never came close to dating).
* Buying him inappropriately expensive gifts on a regular basis
* Just sort of happening to be near his house ALL THE TIME despite not living nearby
* Writing a blog in which she pretended to have a serious relationship with him, including elaborate records of supposed dates and fights and relationship strife that they had. In one case I believe she used his real name, and he found out about it when a mutual friend attempted to give him a talking-to over a recent ""fight.""
* Finding out about his hobbies, interests, cares, and regular schedule(!) despite never actually talking to him...then just happening to be all the places he's going to be throughout the day (where, again, she never talked to him)
* Following another girl home and then following her into her house, despite not being invited to do so
* Manipulating people into hanging out with or feeling sorry for her using real or imagined situations - basically attempting to emotionally blackmail people into befriending and/or dating her
* Constantly touching, flirting with, hanging around, and otherwise aggressively pursuing someone despite his obvious lack of interest (and lack of approval for her various actions)
* Changing her walking route such that it took her past his place of business, so she could look in on him (but again, never talk to him) on a regular basis

Basically creepiness involves unwanted behavior. Most of the instances of female creepiness I see involve the woman attempting to get away with unwanted behavior, usually by holding back just enough that he won't feel justified calling her out on it. That level of careful manipulation (conscious or not) is very creepy."

CadHuevFacial,AskReddit,1389129557.0,"I'm really sorry you're going through this, few things in life are as bothersome as incomplete sleep night after night. I've noticed as I get older that small stresses are more likely to interrupt my sleep cycle. I went about 2 months without sleeping through an entire night without waking up several times, or waking up after a couple hours and being unable to fall back asleep.


Five things that I started doing every night before bed that made radical differences for me, if you're interested:


-Make my bed every morning (I know, not night time): the process of opening my bed at night is surprisingly relaxing, and it's a signal to my body that it's nearly time for bed


-Stretching (and deep breathing) for about 5 minutes and going to the bathroom before laying down

-Not eating/looking at screens 2-3 hours beforehand; no drinking anything caffeinated after 2 PM unless I'm partying later

-Taking about ~~5mg~~ 1-2.5mg of Melatonin when it starts to get dark in the evening (completely natural hormone that is released in the body naturally when the sun goes down and, at that dose, absolutely harmless as a supplement), and drinking a cup or two of chamomile tea

-If, when I'm actually in bed, my mind is still racing or I have a song/story/situation stuck in my head, etc., I try imagining a crackling bonfire, sounds and everything, or something that is equally as soothing to me. Ocean tides coming in and out, Aspen leaves quaking in the middle of a light summer breeze, whatever. Counting backwards from 100 works surprisingly well. The point of these exercises is to give your mind a reason to rest. Ear worms and the ceaseless rumination over the day's events are 'objectives and obstacles' that require alertness and mental exertion to fulfill (duh). 


I don't know if you'll try any of those tricks, but I can say from experience that they have helped dramatically reduce the number of nights in which my sleep is interrupted. Those nights still happen, but there is no doubt I am getting much more sleep. Even if you can't officially fall asleep at night, the least you can do is use that time to meditate and rest your mind as much as possible, which is still beneficial. Make sure the temperature of your room, texture/thickness of your bed spread and pillows are comfortable for you, and wear earplugs if you  have to! Either way, please don't give up on finding something that works for you. Good luck!"

What can we do?  Make a law forcing people to learn the seven sentences they need to get by when talking to the government?  This won't stop the Flemish area around Brussels from becoming a Brussels outskirt.  

Fear of ""frenchification"" is pretty much fear of getting conquered.  (And I understand why people feel this way.) The reaction is almost without exception pointless and petty.  Not just this one, but all reactions in this  category.  It doesn't stop frenchification at all, but it does make us look like bullies.  Legalisation can't do anything about this.

When determining if a ref is 'good', you generally want to be as close to the league average as you can. It seems that his 15 year average is pretty dang good, though his yards per game is a little high. This years numbers seem to favor the home team slightly, but that doesn't really mean much, especially if he happened to be scheduled with teams that play strong at home as compared to other refs.

Basically, outside of Bottlegate and mixing up what team Andy Reid was coaching for, he doesn't have any real 'blemishes' and it should be a fairly well officiated game. (Though there always seems to be more of a 'let them play' mentality in the playoffs)"

It was much less crunchy than I was hoping for. I'd like to try it again, and see if I can pull it off. I'm not eating cheese, so I topped mine with mushrooms, spinach, and a home made healthy marinara sauce I'd frozen from the week before. It does smell AMAZING while it's cooking. Definitely can taste the cauliflower heavily in the middle of the one I made, but the crunchier outsides were perfect."

As for the ""where to get a beer"" question specifically, California has a collection of the best microbrews in the nation (maybe only a little biased here). Out here, the IPA reigns supreme so be prepared for some hop bombs. 

* Nor Cal breweries: Russian River wine country is my favorite brewery. They make my favorite beer (Pliny the Elder), but also have some very interesting casks, wild ales and sours to check out. Sierra Nevada is famous for its Pale Ale, but its seasonals are a must taste as well. Their winter seasonal (Celebration) is one of my favorites. Rogue has some incredibly interesting beers. Definitely worth checking out.

* So Cal breweries: Stone is probably the most famous. Definitely check out their brewery in North county San Diego if you have the chance. Ballast point and Coronado are amazing breweries down in San Diego as well churning out really good IPAs. One of the most underrated places is Pizza Port. All the locations are right off the beach, so drop by for a gourmet pizza, a good microbrew, and then go burn off the calories with a surf session or two.

GuyWithNoHat,sex,1389130822.0,"Here is my perspective about the viewing of porn in a relationship:

If you are dissatisfied with the amount of sex you are having (too little), and he's watching porn in place of having real-life sex with you -- it's a problem.  If you're happy or content with the amount and he's watching porn frequently, *he isn't happy with the amount*.  That could be wrong though, maybe he *is content* but his natural interest in seeing and learning about all things sex is unsatisfied.  It is also entirely possible that your partner is addicted to porn, where he is literally using every chance afforded to him to watch it.

He may have some kinks or things he's interested in, but doesn't feel comfortable enough to share those with you yet.  If you seem really sensitive, conservative, or upset by his porn watching habits -- I can almost guarantee that he does not feel *safe enough* to openly share his feelings or perspective with you.

TL;DR: Don't fear porn because you don't understand your boyfriend's motivation to watch it.  Communicate and be less judgmental to get a glimpse into his mind so that he can open up about it."

There was this girl: called C. Now I met C at the club, and after a bit of flirting went back to hers, had another drink there and chatted about Calvin and Hobbes. So far, everything's looking pretty good. Then we go to the bedroom, we're a bit drunk so after her suggesting we didn't use a condom (don't worry, we did) we slept together, it wasn't the best but still good for a one night stand. Anyway, after about ten minutes I feel like I could go again and started my [foolproof method](http://i.imgur.com/UMhvpjE.jpg) of in bed seduction. Sadly C was rather tired, possibly from my passionate lovemaking, or possibly because it was 5 in the morning and we'd both consumed enough vodka to sedate a Rhino, I'll let you judge. Not being a cunt, I was okay with this, but in perhaps the strangest method of appeasement since the treaty of Versailles C said, with complete and utter conviction: ""You know, you could just rape me and I wouldn't mind.""


Like the tortoise poking its head from its shell only to be confronted by a enraged grizzly bear who's run out of honey to eat, my previously engorged member retreated so fast it was in danger of becoming an internal organ. In my head, as my mind beleaguered with alcohol tried to process the unfolding spectacle while at the same time understood that C's invitation probably warranted a response I scrambled for answer that didn't completely reflect my [knee jerk reaction](http://i.imgur.com/EPYxue9.gif). What I think I managed was: ""Umm... I don't think so"" after which I promptly lay on the bed and shut up. I slept off my hangover there and left late in the morning.


And that, guys and girls, is how I learnt that rape fantasies are really, really, completely not my thing.


**TL:DR** Tired girl suggested I should just ""rape"" her. Surprisingly I wasn't that into the idea."

Let's start with the layout.  Your name and contact info should be centered at the top and in a larger font.  If you have a LinkedIn profile you should list that as well under your email address.

You also need to fix your indentation on Experience - it looks very offputting indented like that.

Lose the Employment Gap.  You don't want to call that out.  Its great you worked on your graduate scheme, but you can tell them about that when they ask.

You need to reformat how you're listing your work experience.  You're simply listing your duties as a programmer, assistant, whatever.  Those bullets should be in a sentence format that immediately follow the ""location"" or department. 

What you need to have for your bullets are quantified accomplishments.  What made you the best programmer or assistant?  Do you have numbers, awards, accommodations, to show your worth?

I'd move your Competencies up to the top, above Experience, if nothing else to cover minimize the impact of your employment gap.

Your competencies would look much better laid out in a tabular format, one to better fill the page, and to improve readability.

Of course, your resume needs to be tailored to each job you are applying for, so you could consider this your ""base resume"".  You might also think about adding relevant coursework under Education if it is a great match to what you are applying for."

We often use support as leverage with my husband's ex wife.  As in we have the entire month to pay it so we pay it strategically...after Christmas or anyone's birthday so that she can't be irresponsible and spend it all on gifts/parties and then not be able to pay her bills.  When someone has control of your kids, and you have something they want (money), it's not unreasonable to use what you have to get what you want.  We also used money to get a change of custody so we'd have them more--girl needed braces, mom couldn't afford them, so we said our insurance would pay for them, but in order to add them to our insurance we'd have to change the custody agreement.  

Some parents aren't reasonable and in fact don't want to help the other parent have a relationship with their children, and when you have a parent like that you HAVE to go alternate routes.

The current rules are fair and balanced in my opinion; however I agree with a few postings in previous threads that emphasize an increase in enforcement, which is why I suppose this is open! ^^^Yes ^^^I ^^^know ^^^the ^^^current ^^^rules

I am located in CST, which is close to EST. I am usually up or working into the early morning, and then start my day around lunchtime. I frequeunt /r/Android quite often, multiple times per day (probably 8-10).

I would be willing to help the Wiki. I have some small editing history with articles on TeamLiquid.net.

Being called a Nazi is a notch on my belt - we had some subreddit drama previously, and enforcing the rules did not settle well with some users, resulting in Nazi accusations being thrown.

-I dont believe people are sinful by nature. If we were sinful by nature god made us that way. If were sinful by nature because of our free will, god gave us free will, we did not choose free will.God knowingly gave us free will most likely knowing what it would lead to just so we could praise him without him forcing us to.

&gt; Then out of the transforming love of Christ in their heart, they desire to be all these things.

My family especially loves Taco Soup (not for any of those self righteous folk who think there is such thing as ""not a real"" taco. Thats as silly as saying pizzas arent real pizzas unless they are made a certain way.)

Toss your meat in the slow cooker and turn it on to finish around when you want to eat.

About an hour before you want to eat, shred or chop up the meat and add the appropriate amount of seasoning for the meat you cooked. Also add sweet corn (1 pack, frozen. Double if you want.), a bottle of tomato juice (as big as will fill your crockpot with meat and corn already in it)

Stir.

Walk away.

About 5 minutes before you want to eat set the table. Include taco toppings and tortilla chips. We always use cheese and sour cream. Sometimes we add tomatoes or lettuce. Onions would be good too.

Serve soup into bowls. Top with toppings. Use chips as you would crackers for other soups (the scoop sort can be used as a spoon.)

Eat.

Be happy.

SentientBagOfWater,AskReddit,1389132552.0,"Sure.  It wasn't the clearest explanation ever.  I'll go with the example above.

I've always had a problem with coffee mugs accruing on my desk.  I'll bring them back with me when I sit down but once I'm at the desk I'll procrastinate over the idea of interrupting work to cart a bunch of them back to the sink to clean.

So instead my deal with myself is that if I get up to grab coffee I *always* make a point of collecting two mugs along the way to take back to the sink.  Even if I'm forgetful sometimes, going to grab coffee on average results in my desk being slightly tidier than before I started, instead of slightly messier.  I never have to clear that mental hurdle of ""taking out the time to tidy up"", so I get to keep feeling lazy while still getting the job done.

I go with the same mental trick anywhere there are messes that I would otherwise allow to gradually build up.  My workbench gets cleared up two tools at a time, every time I go to grab something off a shelf.  Hell, even my living room gets dusted two flat surfaces at a time, any time I turn the television on.

I know that it's easier and cheaper to put in vinyl but why would you take out ceramic tile and put in vinyl when you could just keep the ceramic in until you've saved up the money to put in new, prettier ceramic tile? Unless you're about to sell (and even then I'd probably not) or the floor needs repairs, there's no rush on getting it done--so do it right. Laying ceramic is tedious but not difficult.

CHeck out FerFal's Blog (http://ferfal.blogspot.com/) its fucking fantastic in every way.  And the thing that helped me transition from the ""Zombie"" fantasy to a more realistic survival/collapse approach to things.

As far as things that I remember, here's a few..

1) I remember being a little boy, and being at the supermarket with my mother.  You see, it was pay-day, and inflation growing so rapidly, that people would get their paychecks and literally race to the stores to blow it all, or the next day you wouldn't be able to afford half the stuff you could the previous day.  So we race through the market, load up a cart, and are waiting in line.  We pay for our stuff, and as my mom is handing the cashier money, they announce over the loud-speaker.. ""attention shoppers.. if you haven't paid for your items already, please mark up your prices by 30%"" or whatever percentage inflation was that day.

2) I remember the big collapse or maybe.. '84 or so.  One of my earliest memories actually.  Thousands of people took to the streets in protest.  There was looting, there was violence, people breaking into houses, it was complete chaos.  We lived right downtown, and had a front row seat to everything from our balcony.  And I remember my dad boarding up the entrance to our house, and sitting there with his firearms.  Waiting.  Anybody who would go through that door would have died that day.  And there I sat, watching the horror on TV, and seeing our street and all the chaos and violence just a few meters away.

3) The poor and the kids.  You haven't seen poverty until you've seen hungry children storm a restaurant to steal food of plates, or just stare at you through the window of said restaurant, and knowing that they would stab you in the neck for that slice of pizza.  Going out to a restaurant was a whole ordeal back then.  First you had to find parking, then look for nearby ""hoodlum"" and tip him so that your car would be there when you came back, or be in once piece at least.  Then, when you went into the restaurant, seating would be assigned depending on where you parked your car.  THat way you could keep an eye on it the entire time.  How crazy is that?

But yea, I hoped my anecdotes gave you an idea of some of the craziness I've seen.  Do read the FerFal blog, its outstanding."

POGtastic,TumblrInAction,1389133824.0,"The thing is, there are a lot of jobs where physical requirements show up unexpectedly. For example, my job ostensibly doesn't need any sort of physical fitness. I'm a radio technician; to fix radios, all you need is the intelligence to troubleshoot electronics and maybe a little soldering skill. Women can do both of these just as well as men.

However, our job involves a lot more than just fixing radios. We unpack new equipment. We set up said equipment. We break down and ship off old and broken equipment.

Just to give an example, we have a [precision approach radar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_approach_radar) that can go to one of four runways. There's an electric motor that turns it. When that motor burned out, we were the ones who moved it. It's heavy as hell; it took three big guys to swing it around. A woman would be useless, especially with the limited area to grip the arm. If they needed to change runways for an aircraft landing, that woman would be useless for anything other than moral support.

The same thing happens with jobs like tank maintenance. Great, you can tighten bolts, change the oil, and operate the crane. What happens when they need to pull the treads off? It involves a lot of physical strength. Sure, it doesn't happen very often... but when it does, suddenly you end up realizing that your shop of ten people (which should be able to do it easily) is now a shop of five competent mechanics and five people who are tits on a fish.

So, to ensure that this doesn't happen, you need to set a standard that ensures that everyone can do the tasks that will be expected of them. Easy, right? If you can't pick up X amount of weight, estimated to be your share of a tank tread / heavy-ass radio, you don't get the job. If you can't fill X amount of sandbags, you can't be a seabee. Etc.

The problem, as fire and police departments have discovered to their chagrin, is that standards get lowered and eventually ignored. The reason is that it's much easier to pass people and let them do whatever they want than it is to say ""Nope, sorry. You fail."" The result ends up being affirmative action, with the awesome eventuality of incompetent personnel being put into dangerous situations. That's not fair to the women, and it's not fair to the people who are stuck working with them.

The real answer is to figure out a good standard and hold people to them. Unfortunately, people are people, and we suck at following guidelines that we make for ourselves."

You are the one being confrontational, and frankly, if you consider this a 'debate' you should seriously reconsider your own debate skills. You have made a load of baseless claims, most definitely including opinions of your own.

* Implying it is a prison suggests you are not free to leave and are forced to follow by society's rules. You are free to live away from anybody with such opinions and you can date whoever you like. Your statement is a massive hyperbole that paints you as a sufferer.

* The fact that physically fit people are more attractive, given the huge population of our planet, almost necessitates that the obese man/model wife couple will be rare. The original point was that this never happens in real life, when it is actually fairly common on TV shows. The obese men in these shows are also usually shown to be stupid and lazy.

* One could very easily perform a study on sexiness. There have been studies on physical attractiveness (in layman's terms, sexiness). No scientific study has ever been, nor will ever be objective. If studies on social and psychological topics were required to be objective then there would be no studies on social or psychological studies.

* I did not suggest that only fit people can be regarded as attractive barring mental abnormalities. I do not consider ""fat loving women"" a mental abnormality any more than I consider ""healthy loving women"" or ""skinny loving women"" an abnormality. You offered *one* anecdotal example, your own, to what you though I had stated. It was not even a counterexample, because you did not prove yourself normal. In order for it to be a counterexample you would have to provide an example of a normal person who finds fat men attractive. (I'm sure you're normal, you just didn't prove it).

* Of course it's not your responsibility to coddle me. It's not my responsibility to teach you how to debate, or ride a bike, or go potty. If you're going to make an argument out of this do not bring it down to that level.

* Please cite any credentials you have. I'd like to think I am pretty good at debate but if you're the debate team leader at your high school or something then I'll concede that."

The bit on inconsistency is interesting. Having done officiating (obviously not anywhere near the CFL level) has taught me a lot about what I used to think were ""bad calls"". A lot of what fans think are ""bad calls"" are exactly what the official in question was instructed to do. The problem is that what officials are instructed to do isn't always consistent.

For big games (varsity games and high school playoff games), our crew would have a ~2 hour meeting before the game. We would go over, in detail, all of our positioning and the major rules and that kind of stuff. We'd also go over the two teams. Team A has this trick play. Let's go over all the things that could happen on this trick play and talk about what the correct calls would be. Team B has made complaints about the centre from Team A picking the ball up off the ground while taking his stance. Let's talk about exactly what constitutes, from either team, a premature snap or illegal procedure and what to do about it. Team A's cornerback #9 has a history of jamming receivers. Let's talk about what we'd flag, from either team, for illegal contact and what we wouldn't.

And then after that lengthy meeting, we'd go to the head coaches and give them an executive summary (obviously leaving out things about specific plays) so they have an idea of how we'll be calling the game.

The problem is that, to some extent, what and how we're calling things is done with those two specific teams in mind. Ideally every game a crew does is 100% consistent, but sometimes discussions about a particular game will make you watch for something more closely than you would in another game. *Within a game* the calls should be totally consistent, but between games sometimes it gets fuzzier. I don't know if /u/GargoyleToes's experiences match that.

I've also had a crew chief tell us before the game ""because this is the championship, there won't be any ejections unless they're really blatant"". It's not the sort of thing I agree with, but foremost the entire crew has to be calling everything the same way, so that's what we do.

The CFL should be in a better position to keep things consistent between games than we were just owing to the fact that they never mix and match crews. Crews stick together for the entirety of the season and that alone will let players and coaches know what a game's going to be like just by looking at past behaviour from the crew.

Still, Johnson's certainly right in that sometimes there's a different ""language"" when talking to officials vs coaches vs players on rule interpretations. The fact that we (the officiating crew) are having a 2 hour discussion about rule interpretations and then giving the head coach a 2 minute summary necessarily means there's going to be some sort of scenario that we're going to see differently than them.

I don't know what the league can do about that, but if they can make a good stab at fixing it, that would be amazing."

biffysmalls,Frugal,1389134208.0,"1. Make your budget work on half of your household income. Life throws you curveballs, but they're only a problem if you can't hit them.

2. After setting your needs budget, give each member of your household a weekly allowance, ideally the $ame weekly allowance for both the adults and kids. It will cause the adults to rethink that extra afternoon coffee and, properly advised, teach the children the value of saving money. 

3. When you do spend your money and/or indulge, make it count by buying it once and for life, whenever possible.

4. The only debts that are your friends are any debts attached to capital assets. I include not only credit cards in the bad debt category, but for that matter car loans and even retirement fund/RRSP/IRA loans. Car loans may be unavoidable at times, but they should be killed ASAP, and borrowing for your retirement (other than the case of a reverse mortgage, and even then, only minimally so) doesn't make any sense.

5. If you can't afford the upkeep on something, you can't afford to buy it, no matter how good a deal it is.

6. Your family home is not an asset--it's a home. Do not treat it like an asset, or bank on its appreciation as though it were an income property.

7. Learn enough about the trades that you will come into contact the most as a home owner (plumbing, electrical, construction and HVAC) to know what you can do yourself and what you need to hire someone to do for you. An added bonus of this is that it will make it a lot more difficult to be taken in by a shady plumber or contractor because they will reveal themselves to be as such to you in ways that would go unnoticed to many other people.

8. Know the difference between a need, a want and an investment. For example, a window is a need, a pretty window with nice shutters and drapes is a want, a triple paned window that will cut your gas/heating bill by $10 a month is an investment worth considering. 

9. Protecting capital and asset management is more important than generating wealth.

10. If you can't pay off in full what you're putting on your credit card within 60 days, you can't afford it. Credit gives you flexibility, not magic money.

11. It doesn't matter who it is, but in any long term relationship, one person and one person alone should manage the budget and the money. Multiple non-joint accounts (especially non-savings accounts) lead to problems and waste, and sometimes even distrust.

12. When presented with an investment opportunity, no matter how conservatively estimated the returns may be, if the other party seems to be assuming more risk than you, you are probably being conned.

13. Bag your lunch and breakfast (or eat before you leave), but eat out at least once per week. Indulgence is always better than compulsion!

14. Stay humble. Financial literacy and discipline is not common sense in a consumer driven culture. We are the outliers, but that doesn't make us superior. Offer help if asked, but without being a dick about it.

15. You can't take it with you, but your surviving family can."

You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till unrighteousness was found in you. In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence in your midst, and you sinned; so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O guardian cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 

&gt; It wasn't until a bit later

How later? Gospels? or what?

&gt; All that backstory on him being an angel... who rebelled against God... Well those stories are taken from outside the Bible... And if he was the serpent in Eden, of which Genesis makes no claim

&gt; Thanks (Satan) for giving us the knowledge and free will. :P 

I don't understand what you mean that Satan gave us knowledge? God already told Adam and Eve of the consequences of eating the fruit, which were that you would die. Satan, however, blatantly lies saying ""You won't die!"", but Adam and Eve actually do acquire mortality because of that. So really we shouldn't thank Satan here for being the deceiver.

And free will? God gave the humans free will from the beginning. They always had the choice to either eat the fruit or not eat the fruit. Adam and Eve chose, at first, to obey God and not eat the fruit. Satan just deceives them into eating the fruit. If God didn't want humans to have free will, he would've made sure there was no tree to begin with. He would've just programmed humans to be his mindless robots. **BUT HE DIDN'T**"

OmniaMors,gifs,1389134270.0,"yes and no

so there are a lot of factors at play here, first off the fluid dynamic effects are crazy, so lets set that aside for a second and simplify it. 

Lets say you took a 1cm cube and threw it on, well the lava instantly heats 1cm^2 area of dry ice. If you scaled it up and threw a 2cm cube 4cm^2 of dry ice would heat up. so although the cube was doubled, the amount of gas was quadroupled. But here is the kicker, the 1cm cube has a volume of 1cm^3 and the 2cm cube has a volume of 8cm^3 . which means even though the gas was quadroupled the mass was octupled.

so thats the yes, in that directly scaling up does make it worse since the mass to surface area ratio changes. but also no because its not like the effect doesnt scale, if you used  2x2x1cm block (area is 4cm^2 and volume is 4cm^3 ) it should act the same as a 1x1x1cm cube."

R99,nfl,1389134847.0,"OK, I'll start off by saying I'm trying to sell my team to you. You should follow the Green Bay Packers. 

1. The team is partially owned by the fans. We are the only major sports team in America where the fans can own the team. While owning it doesn't really get you much other than a ticket into a shareholder's meeting in August at Lambeau Field, it's still very unique. 

2. A great offense. Our defense isn't very good, but the offense is balanced and fun to watch. Aaron Rodgers (or as you know him, Josh) is one of the best quarterbacks in the league and many regard him as the best. But, unlike two other greats, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, Aaron will still be playing for at least 7 or more years. The other two are pretty old and will retire in a year or two. Also, first year running back Eddie Lacy has been exciting and has performed at a later elite level. There's no doubt he'll be one of the greatest running backs in franchise history. 

3. Small town team. Green Bay is by far the smallest city to have a professional team in any city in America. Green Bay has a population of about 100,000. Despite that, every single game since the 1960's has sold out. 

4. The Packers play in the cold a lot. Besides Minneapolis, Green Bay is the coldest NFL city. However, the Vikings (the team that play in Minneapolis) play in a dome. But, this upcoming season and the one after that, they are temporarily playing in an outdoor stadium until their new indoor stadium is built. "

Mongoosen42,vegan,1389135145.0,"I'm not convinced. Couple reasons.

First, the writer mostly only addresses the issue of acidification. But there are other issues as well that she doesn't address. One of the big ones is phospherous. Phospherous lowers your body's calcium absorbtion abilities. You can be taking in a loy of calcium, but if your diet is high in phospherous, your body won't use it. Animal products are high in phospherous, plant priducts are not. The writer doesn't address this at all.

Second, and what honestly bothered me more, is that the writer makes it sound like the only evidence for vegans having better bone strength came from one statistics analysis done on hip fractures in the 90's. Thats bollocks. There were multiple studies done over the course of more than a decade that made the link between animal consumption and osteiperosis anything but controversial among nutritionists.

If I respond favorably to that opening comment, then continue talking to me. Your best go-ahead sign is if I actually pick up my end of the conversation and comment on the topic myself, rather than just nodding and smiling. If he can make me laugh or engage me in interesting stories, then so much the better.

What you want to do is establish a connection. Just walking up and introducing yourself is a really clunky, awkward way to do that. You're better off building on common ground. Your name can come a little later.

If I start to look really distracted, and especially if I actively focus on something else after you start talking to me, I'm trying to tactfully let you know that I don't want to talk any more. (If something is genuinely distracting me but I still want to talk to you, then I'll make an effort to talk to you instead of just pretending you aren't there.) If I seem uncomfortable and look like I'm scanning around for another person, then I'm looking for someone who will save me from this interaction. If I stop smiling at you, then you're starting to annoy me.

I don't like canned pick-up lines, abrupt introductions, or guys who attempt to tell me how I feel or what I think about things. He also should not touch my stuff (which includes pulling out my headphones or pushing aside my book). I don't like being approached when I'm very busy or having a bad day. If I don't smile back when you make eye contact, I'm probably having a bad day.

FeatherDie,AskReddit,1389135691.0,"Instead of higher level math courses (which were just given again in college), we should have appropriate personal financial and business management classes. 

BETTER computer classes. Learning to type and using photoshop are beginner skills. Students should be learning how to evolve with the technology around them. 

I would like to see more work/trade/apprenticeship programs integrated into school systems. Even if it's only once a week learning a trade or experiencing one, it's a great way to gain basic knowledge that will get you a job while figuring out your career. Hell, plenty of people make a decent living of a trade.

Also, government classes stink. They focus on the structure and history of our federal government, and basically do a mad dash over local government. I think it's more important that students learn how they can and will affect local policy and state policy by exercising their write to vote, petition, protest, etc. Knowledge of federal workings is important, but it is also affected by local politics. A course that is 3/4 local politics/government and 1/4 federal government is more appropriate.

Proper sexual education classes (especially in my state). I am of the belief that abstinence programs are just sticks in the mud. They are not sexual education programs. They are sexual topic avoidance programs, and focus more on personal strength in *avoiding* sexual encounters. Knowing one's body is very important, and knowledge of the opposite sex is equally as important. Many people see abstinence programs as exerting some sort of control over young adults, which isn't true. Any parent of a teenager is going to know that they cannot control that person. They offer guidance, support, and boundaries. The child chooses whether or not they accept those things."

This is a man who beat a pregnant woman to death, and I actually found myself disgusted with Tony as he was slamming Ralph's head against the kitchen floor, even though I knew I should be feeling liberated.  It's truly a feat to make a character play with your emotions so much, and Ralphie Cifaretto is, in my opinion, the one who does so the most.

Second would be Funhouse.  I loved how The Sopranos wasn't afraid to enter the subconscious minds of their characters, and therefore Funhouse has always been a favorite.  The bulk of the episode takes place in Tony's twisted boardwalk fever dream, which is just as cryptic and disturbing as anything The Sopranos has ever done (except maybe The Test Dream, which was also fantastic).  However, the episode remains strong after Tony's dreams have concluded.  The entire second half of the episode contains many terrific moments, in particular Pussy's demise.

Always make it sound like the clothing or something else is at fault, and you're just worried about that (pretend you don't notice her body at all).

I'll neglect to mention the well-known ones (Camaro, Charger, Barracuda, Mustang, etc). If you want one of those then you know what you want already. The 'compact' cars of their era are generally lighter than their full-size siblings so a built small block will give them plenty of scoot.

## [Mopar A Bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_A_platform):

This refers to the Plymouth Valiant/Dodge Dart family of cars. However, this also includes their sportier derivations: the 1st and 2nd gen Plymouth Barracuda, the Plymouth Duster and Scamp, the Dodge Dart Swinger, and Dodge Demon/Dart Sport. Depending on what you're into, these cars are pretty cool looking. More notably, parts are dirt cheap since they're common to their more common cousins (the base Valiant and Dart).

* *Maintenance difficulty: 1*

## [Ford Falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Falcon_\(North_America\)):

Don't let this car's humble looks fool you, these made potent track cars with a lightweight treatment. Designed to be a European-style 'compact', tons were made to supply plenty of parts. They have a pretty dedicated user base all over the US and are almost perfectly parts compatible with Mustangs for lots of aftermarket options.

## [Ford Maverick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Maverick_\(Americas\)):

A classic in the compact muscle world, the Nova is still a popular and common sight at car shows. They've been popular in the racing scene and have graced dragstrips with many a quick time. Paired with the venerable small block Chevy (SBC) and you have a potent vehicle.

## [GM G Platform \(Chevy Monte Carlo, Buick Grand National, etc\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_G_platform_\(RWD\)):

If Vin Diesel could rock it, so can you. You'll be ripping off emissions controls left and right but all you really need are V8 motor mounts and an SBC. This platform also carried the potent GNX, a classic turbocharged car.

* *Purchase cost: 2*

* *Rarity: 2*

## Ford Mustang ([Fox body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang_\(third_generation\)) and [4th gen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang_(fourth_generation))):

Don't knock the Fox body looks until you've seen one on 12"" wide slicks. The potent 5.0 can make for a hauling ride. If you opt for a 4th gen, welcome to the new era of muscle: EFI, DOHC (sometimes), and big injectors.

The long and lean styling of these cars are unlike the Camaros that came before and after and because of that they've been left out in the cold by a lot of classic muscle car guys. But these are many's first project cars and with the potent SBC or LS V8s under the hood as much power as you desire can be had for pretty cheap.

## [Ford Panther Platform (Crown Victoria)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_panther_platform):

Until the supply of cheap Crown Vics available at auction drops off, the Panther platform might be your best bet for getting into a full size, RWD, American V8. The good news is they all come with a V8, the bad news is you'll have to swap in a manual to get rid of the slushbox. Look up the Mercury Marauder for an optimistic look at the potential of this car.

## [Ford Taurus SHO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Taurus_SHO):

Ahh, where do I classify this? Big and American but FWD and V6 powered, the SHO was a bit confusing but it's a real performer. The fantastic Yamaha-designed revvy V6 makes plenty of power and the unassuming styling puts it in definite sleeper class. You'll embarrass a lot of overly confident drivers with one of these.

A great combination of sportiness and economy, these Euro cars are a ton of fun. There's almost no upper limit on the performance you can get out of them but you'll be scratching your head more often and spending more time searching for parts compared to most American cars.

## [Alfa Romeo Alfetta/GTV6/Milano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_Alfetta):

A personal favorite, what you give up in ease of maintenance you gain in spirited driving characteristics and Italian flair. A spirited owner community will help you with the required preventative maintenance. The rear transaxle makes for terrific balance and the Busso V6 in the later cars is heaven-sent.

## [Alfa Romeo 164](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_164):

This chassis was shared with the Saab 9000, and two Euro only cars (a Fiat and a Lancia). With the highly capable 24 valve 3.0L V6 and available at a steal of a price these cars make a terrific luxury European sedan. The FWD layout is less popular than earlier RWD Alfas but greater availability is an incentive. Look for the 164S models for a bit more performance.

## Porsche [944](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_944):

One of the best chassis' you can get, a rear transaxle car that Porsche purist's never warmed up. Leaves more for us! For maximum fun look for the much more expensive 944t, a built up turbo model. These are some of the best track cars and are a common sight at Porsche Club of America track days. The Porsche 924 was the first iteration of this car but for much of its life had an undesirable VW engine, only the last few years of the 924 (sold as the 924S) had the much better Porsche 2.5L engine and are only differentiated but a more svelte body lacking fender flares.

## [Porsche 914](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_914):

The VW-Porsche hybrid provides ridiculous amounts of fun. The VW parts keep it cheap to work on and it warms up very well to some light suspension modifications. It's a mid engine car which gives it great balance.

Often overshadowed by it's DTM rival, the E30 M3, the 190E is still a great car. They're much smaller than you're imagining, this is not your grandfather's boat of a Benz.

This *is* your grandfather's boat of a Benz. These classic old Mercedes chassis' are some of the most venerable cars in existence. Designed for 30 years of daily usage they have a dogged reputation for bulletproof reliability. After their successful runs in Europe, many have been imported to the Middle East and are one of the most popular taxis in many countries of that region. The diesel models (with the OM617) in particular are reliable and sought after, with easy waste vegetable oil (WVO) conversions available from companies like GreaseCar. If the big old Benzes tickle your fancy also check out similar chassis' from the era, such as the W116 that the awesome 450SEL 6.9 rode on, or the much classier W111 available in a stylish fintail body style.

Depending on who you ask, older Volvos may not fit the bill of *sports* sedans but they're a great old car with a good following anyway. Affectionately referred to as 'bricks' they're a fun car with original power plants, turbo chargers, or a variety of motor swaps. Within the 200 series there are various higher performance options, such as the 242 GT. The successor, the Volvo 850, is a good car as well but the FWD/AWD architecture isn't quite as much fun.

The car was sold in Europe as a Sierra, where it was rallied extensively. Still popular for racing, this turbo-4 RWD chassis is funky but highly capable and unique. Though rare they're still cheap and I'd highly recommend a nice rally treatment complete with white OZ rims.

If you live in a rural area and like to hit the trails, you'll probably love off-roading. Including everything from mudding, to rock-climbing, to overland expeditions, it's a multidisciplinary scene. I've omitted pickup truck and decidedly pickup based vehicles like the Dodge Ramcharger and Chevrolet Blazer but those are all certainly good options as well.


## Jeep [CJ2A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_CJ#CJ-2A)/[CJ3A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_CJ#CJ-3A):

This is the civilian version of the legendary military Jeep of WW2. Iconic is an understatement for one of the most recognizable vehicles ever produced. In person they're more like a side-by-side or ATV in size, but built like a tank. The original military examples have a dedicated following, committed to authenticity and historical accuracy.

The Scout was a trailblazer in more ways than one. It split the difference between the utilitarian Jeeps and more comfortable on road trucks. Available in a number of fun body styles, the simple styling is very appealing. Rust have eaten a lot of these but they're still available. Anemic original power plants make this a prime candidate for fun motor swaps.

Later Broncos are available and cheap but the first generation with round headlights are almost as rare as the Scouts.

The saying is that 'the answer is always Miata' and that continues to hold true regardless of question. Want a daily driver that you can Autocross on the weekends? Miata. Want a good base for a club racer? Miata. Want a good chassis for a V8 swap? Miata. The mechanically identical 1st and 2nd generations are the best project cars and dirt cheap.

They've remained a wildly popular project car, though the early cars have come up in price. You can de-plastic a 280Z until it looks essentially like an early 240Z.

Though this car doesn't fit the classic and vintage theme of much of this list, it has proven performance and great handling. You might get bored of the stock looks and performance but the modification happy platform lends itself well to some tuning. If you're looking for a good auto- or rally-cross contender this might be a good option.

### Find listings

In this day and age, finding a good project car is all about practicing search-fu and constant vigilance. Before you start looking, set a maximum price you'll pay and a maximum distance you'll drive. Really. Set those numbers hard and fast, or you'll fall into the trap of 'well this one is only $500 more and it's only 100 miles further away' until you're spending 90% of your budget and driving 1000 miles for a car.

Look up buyer's guides for the chosen vehicle to get an idea of common problems and decent prices. [Hemmings Motor News](http://www.hemmings.com/) publishes a lot of buyer's guides that will be available online, and many forum users will have written them as well. Search around google to see what you can find.

Here are the most common sources for a car and some tips on how to use them:

**[eBay Motors](http://www.ebay.com/motors)**

eBay is wildly popular. This is both the advantage and disadvantage. On one hand you can find most anything on there, on the other hand everyone else can as well. You most likely won't find an amazing steal on eBay but you'll probably find what you're looking for. A few tips: use their saved search functions and email notifications. Definitely don't browse eBay without an account, it's free and opens up a lot of tools. One of the most important tools is the ability to look at completed listings and whether or not they sold. This is really useful for getting a good idea of what cars are actually worth. eBay has a [project car](http://www.ebay.com/bhp/project-car) category that most people don't know about.

**[Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites)**

You will probably buy your project car on craigslist. CL has taken over from eBay as well as a lot of the local classifieds and you can find anything on here. While it's widely used, not a lot of people use it to full potential. The first key is using boolean, aka search operators like AND, OR, and NOT. CL has a slightly different boolean code and you read about it [here](http://www.craigslist.org/about/help/search) or [here](http://liquidparallax.com/2010/04/07/optimize-craigslist-with-boolean-search-operators/). Set up craigslist searches for the car you're looking for and key in all the years you're interested in, every possible spelling of the name including common mispellings (GT-R and GTR, or Alpha Romero and Alfa Romeo for example).

Once you've done that, what I've found to be the best way to keep up with a search is using the RSS feed. Craigslist allows you to create an RSS feed of any search. RSS feeds are essentially an email-like subscription to a blog or site and the feed will update anytime there's new content or, for CL, a new item that matches your search terms. Create CL searches in every region you would drive to for what you're looking for, read [this blog post](http://brittanyherself.com/cgg/tutorial-how-to-subscribe-to-craigslists-rss-feeds/) for more about how to subscribe, I recommend [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/) for your feeds, and [this Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-subscription-extensio/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd) will make everything easier. Voila, now you will literally *never* miss a car that you might be interested in buying.

**Local classifieds**

Find the local classifieds in your newspaper or specialty publications and keep an eye there as well. These are the papers being put out of business by CL, for better or for worse. There won't be much there but there's a good chance you'll find a non-internet savvy seller who's posted their car here and nowhere else. You'll likely have to visit a brick and mortar store to find copies but it could be well worth it.

**Make/model specific forums and owner's groups**

Early on in the process you should create an account on a forum. Introduce yourself nicely, use proper capitalization and grammar, and let everyone know that you're interested in a car. Ask any questions you have about them, use the search function, and ask if anyone knows a good place to buy one. Don't forget to ask about some common problems to look for! Though it varies, these communities are usually very helpful and very enthusiastic to share their love for whatever they drive. Once you get into the project these folks will likely be a primary source of parts and information.
******
###Examine listings

So now that you're seeing tons and tons of listings for your desired car, how do you sort out which ones to contact? Here are the primary factors you should be considering:

* **Price:** Unfortunately, this is most often the number one requirement. But a lot can be determined by the price of a classifieds listing. If it's high: does it seem like the seller is reaching and dreaming, hoping for a sucker but would take a reasonable amount for it? The 'OBO' (or best offer) tag is usually a good indication of this. Is it too low? If the price of a car is wayy too low there's probably something the seller isn't telling you or it's a scam. There's a small chance that they just don't know what it's worth but that'll be clear from the ad. Is the price the kind of number that you would choose? Round, even, ends with 0s or is it a $1999 kind of a thing? Most of these are dealers but some also list their cars at that price to sneak in under a $2000 maximum search. To best prepare you for this, look up completed listings on eBay, [NADA valuation](http://www.nadaguides.com/), and [Kelley Blue Book values](http://www.kbb.com/) to see what's reasonable.

* **Location:** Of course there will be a maximum radius you'll travel but the distance will affect some other criteria as well. If the car is cheap but it will cost you $500 in gas and towing costs to get it home then that doesn't help you much. If the car looks a bit dubious but is in your hometown you can easily roll the dice and go look at it. Do you have friends in the area of the car who would go check it out or store the car for a week or two while you get ready to bring it home? Services like [Jewel or Jalopy](http://www.jewelorjalopy.com/) connect car buyers with local car enthusiasts who can inspect your far-away purchase.

* **Listing text:** Does the seller sound like a total moron? Does he seem to know anything about the car? Look at these two sample ads and tell me who you would rather deal with:

&gt;alpha romero 4 sale, runs good, needs nothing, fast car 3000 text 555-555-5555

Or:

&gt;I'm selling a 1982 Alfa Romeo Spider. The car's in good shape for the year, currently on the road and running well. Had a lot of fun with this car but time to move on. Asking $3000, call or text 555-555-5555

Even though the second ad has almost no new information I predict a much smoother experience. The deal would have to be really sweet to call on the first ad.

**Photos:** I've included a lot more information on photos in the next section as you'll most likely get the best pictures after you get in touch with the guy. An ad without photos is an inconvenience but not as much of a red flag as you'd think. Some people can't quite figure out the technology, or they're used to older classifieds where photos aren't an option. Of course, good clear photos are a great sign and should make you a bit more optimistic.

**Mileage:** This is a tricky one. In a daily driver you want the lowest mileage you can find. However, in a project it's not nearly as big of a deal. Especially with an older car you'll likely be replacing most of the wear parts anyway and in a newer car you'll likely be upgrading. Mileage wear items include:

* Suspension components: shocks and sometimes springs, bushings, struts if the car has it
* Brake components: pads/shoes, rotors/drums, lines, slave and master cylinder
* Drivetrain: transmission and rear end
* Engine: pistons, rings, cylinder wall/liners, valvetrain

As you can see, much of this is easy to replace and encouraged anyway. One of the most expensive wear items is the cylinder block itself but the availability of oversize pistons and overboring at a machine shop make it easy to bring an engine back. Long story short: don't worry too much about mileage.

**Red flags:** Here are some common red flags:

* *""Super reliable, hasn't needed any work!""*: It's about to need a LOT of work.
* *""Basket case"", ""Would make a great project""*: They've lost so many parts that they can't actually call it a car anymore.
* *""Selling for parts""*: Sometimes this means that they don't have a title (if you live in a non-title state this is awesome), often it means that it's truly not worth bringing back
* *Any form of promise about how cool it will be when fixed*: Don't let them sell you on what the car could be, let's talk about what the car is
* *No technical details like engine and drivetrain listed*: They probably don't know and that tells you a lot about how well it's been taken care of.
* *""Custom""/""Customized""*: Run.
* *""Modified""*: Run, *fast*."

kowalski71,projectcar,1389136357.0,"###8) How to buy your project car

Now you get to go on a car purchasing adventure! So let's say you've found an ad that looks very promising and you want to pursue it.
*****
1) Get in touch. Use whatever their preferred method of contact is, be it email or phone. I'm very leery of people who recommend you text them. It's too short form and you won't be able to ask the questions you want to ask. On that note, there are a lot of red flags you could see here. Short or curt replies, poor grammar, or rudeness should all be big red flags.
*****
2) Ask for photos. Pictures are worth a thousand words. From a good picture you'll be able to tell how well the car has been maintained, how it's been stored, or where possible problems are. If they are hesitant to send photos, send old or out of date photos, or very specific photos (no wide shots, no close ups) your hackles should be raised; that's a bad sign.

If there are any photos that look concerning, ask about them on the forum that you've made friends on. (Blank out the license plate if it's in the picture. It really doesn't put someone at risk whatsoever but many are concerned about that so you should respect their privacy.) While you're there, ask if anyone in the area knows the car. Chances are good that someone will have went to see it, used to own it, or used to work on it.
*****
3) Ask some questions. Start with a few general queries. These are some of my favorites:

* ""Why are you selling the car?""
* ""How long since the car was last on the road?""
* ""Did you put many miles on the car?""
* ""Are you flexible on the price at all?"" (This will give a decent idea how much they're willing to negotiate without outright asking for a deal.)

The answers to those questions will reveal a lot about the owner and the car. Next ask some specific questions about the car. Refer back to buyer's guides and forums for examples. Ask about common maintenance items; if a particular component is known to be unreliable or need special service a competent owner should be aware of it. If they're not the car probably hasn't been taken very good care of. If they're offended by you asking so many questions that's a red flag. They're probably trying to hide something. As long as you're polite about it, ask away.
*****
4) Set up a time to meet. In most circumstances don't ask them to meet you somewhere or halfway. Ask them what time would be convenient. Decide if you'll be going to possibly buy and bring the car home or if you're going to just take a look. This depends on how far away it is and other factors. Keep in mind that U-Haul does pretty cheap car hauler rentals, less than $100 for 24 hours, but their car haulers are about 2000 lbs and you'll need a decent sized truck to pull them. Using a tow dolly can also be a good option but check the laws in the states you'll be travelling through; many require the vehicle on the tow dolly to be registered and/or insured.
*****
5) Meet up with them. To prepare, bring some hand tools, a jack, and a [compression tester](http://www.amazon.com/INNOVA-3612-Compression-Tester-Piece/dp/B000EVU89I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389124833&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=compression+tester). If possible bring a spare battery and some gas to make it easy to start up the car. Bring someone knowledgeable about cars if you know someone who's willing to tag along. While you're at their place, try to be likable and strike up conversation. The more they like you, the better it will go.

One important warning; you'll be excited to go see the car. *Don't decide to buy it before you see it.* It sounds crazy but it happens all the time. Be prepared to walk away from the deal and know that whatever money you invest in going to see it and getting ready to bring it home could be an unavoidable expense of the search that you'll have to eat.
*****
6) Inspect the car. Be thorough! This step can save some nasty surprises later on.

* Jack the car up and look for rust. Some universal rust spots are fenders, rockers, and suspension mounts.
* Check out the interior. Condition of the seats? If the car's been sitting, any evidence of animals living in there? Pull up the carpets and look for floor pan rust.
* Check over the engine compartment. Does it look clean? Does the wiring look to be in good shape?
* Examine the brakes carefully. If it has discs you'll be able to look right at the surface of the disc and the thickness of the pads. If it has drums you'll at least be able to see if they're seized or not. Look at the hydraulic lines for rust. **Always expect to do a complete brake job.**
* How complete is the car? Remember that trim and accessories can add up quickly and put a dent in your budget.
* If you can, take it for a drive. See if the steering pulls or the suspension knocks. Running a car at low speeds in a high gear can show how well tuned the carburetor is. Just be on the lookout for anything that might be wrong. If possible, drive or ride in a well-maintained example of the car before you go look at yours.

But what problems are okay (read: fun and cheap to fix) and which are very bad?

**Rust**: An almost universal problem for most areas of the country. Body work is time intensive and will require some initial investment. You'll need either a welder and someone who can use it or a lot of your budget will go to a body shop. When you're looking at rust look at the complexity and location of the metal it's on. For example, a spare tire well in the truck is a pretty simple piece of metal with good accessibility. Replacement parts are available and, more importantly, it's hidden from view. Lastly, it's not too structural so a poor repair job won't make the car unsafe. A-pillar (between the windshield and the front windows) rust is much harder to fix because it's very visible, a complex piece of metal, and structural.

A note about the overall build of the car as it makes a difference also. There are two predominate varities of car construction: body-on-frame and unibody, with the switch from the former to the latter commonly being in the mid '60s (though there are some outliers). Body-on-frame has a ladder frame that the entire running gear is attached to and a separate, non-structural body bolts onto it. You can drive just the frame and drivetrain around with no body. Body-on-frame cars are easy to repair rust in as all the sheet metal is non-structural and easy to access. In a unibody the structure and shape of the car come from one complex piece of sheet metal. The roof, the frame, and the body panels are all one complex and integral piece. This makes them safer and lighter but more difficult to work on.

**Mechanical condition**: Many of us are far more likely to fix mechanical wear and damage than body damage. A lot of people get into project cars *to* learn about mechanical repairs. With this in mind, the big concern with fixing an engine or drivetrain is the cost of parts. A typical engine rebuild will consist of at least a full gasket and seal kit, piston rings, some head work (valve seals, possibly valve seats and new valves), and of course a carburetor rebuild. Price some of these things out before you go to see the car to know what you're getting yourself into. As far as the actual work, wih the exception of some rare and specialty engines *don't be intimidated*. Rebuilding an engine is a pretty straightforward process and there's a lot of educational material available. Just be conscientious and do your research but jump right in there.

Transmissions are often trickier to rebuild and parts are more difficult to replace. When considering a car with a worn-out transmission, expect to replace it unless your research indicates that they're rebuildable. Usually it turns out replacement with a good used unit is the more cost effective option.

Ask them if they have any spare parts or documentation. Spare parts are always useful and they might have some old doodads in the barn they forgot about. Most of the cars on my list are appreciating in value and any documentation might really improve resale value.
*****
7) Barter. Negotiating is a bit tricky. You don't want to come across as a total cheapskate. Ideally you want to seem like someone who is capable of paying full price but knows enough about the car to know that it's not worth it. If you can find something wrong with the car that the seller didn't know about that gives you some bargaining power. (""Oh well with those rusted cab corners, that truck really isn't worth your asking price."") Start listing the costs of repairs. (""It's gonna be at least $500 to rebuild that engine, just in parts."") Be firm and confident but never a dick. Understand their situation as well.

I feel like I hardly need to say this, but you won't be able to pay with a check, money order, or any of that stuff. Bring cash.
*****
8) Get it home. This can be a tricky part. If you have a trailer just hoist it on up. If you plan on driving it home, here are some tricks. Many states offer temporary tags specifically for this reason, they'll cost $20-$40 at the DMV and you'll probably need a title, bill of sale, and proof of insurance. Make sure someone has a smart phone or internet access to get insurance. If you're driving really far away see if someone back home could register it for you and overnight the plates to wherever you're going. Once on the road, be very cautious of possible issues with the car. You'll generally want to avoid driving it illegal (those are some expensive and risky tickets if you get caught) but if you must, use plates from a similar make/model of car and keep your chase vehicle behind you to hide the plates when at all possible. Make sure all the stupid stuff that gets people pulled over is squared away, like lights."

##How to work on a car

You may be thinking: ""I have no idea to work on cars. It is clearly a black magic art, honed in dingy shops across the world over the last hundred years and passed down from father to son in a secret mechanic order."" That is not true. Working on cars is essentially four things:

1. The overall process
2. The specific task
3. The tricks
4. The tools

I'll go into each of these things in a bit more detail but hopefully breaking it down will make it less intimidating.

**1. The process**

This is what's outlined in a service manual. ""To replace the camshaft, first remove all the breather lines from the valve cover, then remove the valve cover."" It's a simple step-by-step procedure, you can find it in Haynes guides, Chilton guides, the factory service manual, or any of the other service guides for your specific vehicle. You can also find this process in forums or talking to friends. Usually you'll want to check a few different sources to get a consensus and make sure that any one manual didn't miss something.

*Everything* is a process. From changing a brake pad all the way to rebuilding an engine. If you get a good procedure and follow the instructions you can figure it out. There's very little in mechanics that requires some intrinsic or instinctive skill, like sculpting or something like that. Mostly it's procedures and patience. Just work your way through some simple and low stakes jobs like brakes to get a hang of it, then jump into more complex stuff.

**2. The task**

The specific task you're working on is kind of a sub process. The manual might say: ""remove the valve cover"" and no more. If you've removed a few valve covers you know that means you have to find all the hardware, pull the breather lines, then hit the cover sideways gently with a rubber hammer to break the gasket loose. That's the specific task. Each probably has specific tricks, like when you pull a speedo drive from a transmission watch out for gear oil that'll pour out and possibly *directly into your ear*. (Thanks, dad, for warning me about that.)

Most of these tasks are universal, or at least common between groups of vehicles (domestics, imports, FWD, RWD, etc). If you know how to remove a starter on a Ford Mustang you can probably do it on a Dodge truck. So as you do these jobs, your competency grows. Think of them as tools in your toolbox.

**3. The tricks**

The tricks are what separates even competent amateur mechanics from people who have done this a lot or professionals. They're real time savers and they're just kind of universal 'tools' for dealing with stuck bolts, stubborn parts, etc. Here are some of them but you'll have to learn most of it by doing:

* Get the right tools. Not investing in the correct tools can cost a lot of money later on. Specialized wrenches or even universal special tools (valve spring compressors, slide hammers, etc) will usually pay for themselves. A lot of auto parts stores will lend you specialty tools with a deposit.

* Get as much literature as you can. Haynes and Chilton guides are a great place to start, but factory service manuals are usually the best source. Many are available online in various places. It's best to have a few manuals around as they have different levels and areas of detail.

* Rusted bolts will likely be one of your biggest nemeses. The first line of offense is soaking them in penetrating spray DAYS before you do the job. Even a week might not be too much. If you know you'll have to take off certain hardware, first assess the risk here. If it's an important bolt that dead ends into your engine block then shearing it off will be a huge pain in the ass, you'll have to drill and easy out and possibly damage your engine block. If it's a nut and bolt set in a place that you can drill it out if it breaks, then it's really not that important and you might just drill through without even trying to twist it off. First do a good job cleaning the parts you can see with a wire brush then start soaking them in WD40 or PB Blaster every 12 hours or so. This will make an amazing difference. When you go to take them off always use 6-point sockets or wrenches. 12-points are convenient but can round off the bolt heads and leave you in trouble. I've found impact wrenches to be less likely to shear off a bolt than using a lot of torque on a wrench like a breaker bar. Impact guns won't plastically deform (stretch) the metal and if you start with relatively low air pressure (or a setting on an electric impact) you probably won't break them. If that doesn't do the trick, you'll have to use heat. Heat can be an amazing tool for getting hardware off. You'll need either MAP gas (like propane but burns hotter) or oxy-acetylene for most jobs.

* Be anal about sorting and organizing hardware and parts as they come off the car. If you can't find it then you don't own it. Use old coffee cans, jars, or yogurt containers. Egg cartons make great storage for tiny hardware. Also document how things came off. Take lots of photos as you take things apart. I'll grab a spare piece of cardboard and stick bolts through it in the approximate shape of their bolt pattern. It sucks to have a handful of hardware and have no idea where it goes. [Magnet trays](http://www.amazon.com/TEKTON-1902-Round-Magnetic-Parts/dp/B000NPUJS0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389128331&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=magnet+tray) are useful for not losing hardware as you take it off.

* Be prepared to spend a lot of time cleaning. You'll be amazed at how much better a car looks after you detail it. Clean with q-tips, the correct cleaning agents, every nook and cranny. Clean under the engine bay, clean all the parts that come off. If you can, paint or powder coat parts as they go back on. This will make your final product look *amazing* and promotes good workmanship.



*****

Have fun! Don't let the project frustrate you too much. Try to be working on a few different projects of the car at once so you can switch gears. The #1 enemy of project cars is loss of interest. Early on try to do something very rewarding, like totally refurbish a small component and make it look great. Then imagine the rest of the car like that. Find like-minded people to wrench with you, put on some good music, open a beer (if you're so inclined)."

If it progressed that far (which is not very likely) it could ruin some things. You might lose your job, you might not. You might find out you have some judgmental family members, you might not.

He should really at least give her a heads up so she can bring something to entertain herself if that's what he has in mind.

If he does lots of interesting things (with video games as just one hobby) and is capable of setting the screens aside so he can spend time with his love interest, then most women I know are totally fine with that. I will say, though, that guys who seem really *really* into video games (talk about them a lot, wear video game shirts all the time, etc.) also seem like the kind of guy who's going to make you a WoW widow, so that can turn some women off before they get the chance to find out that you're not as obsessed as you seem.

The argument *for* including them generally is that the JW's also insert god's name into the NT which was *also* absent from the earliest manuscripts available. So if you're going to do that, why not include the texts as well? Either you accept that the earliest manuscripts are valid and leave both the name Jehovah and the scriptures OUT, or you argue that the name and the scriptures should be IN because they're added in later manuscripts.

But this is a weird middle ground: removing one, leaving the other.

OriginalStomper,law,1389136867.0,"&gt;I was under the impression that arbitration is far cheaper than a trial.

Yes, that's what they (AAA, FINRA, JAMS) want you to think.  It may even be true in certain ""cookie cutter"" disputes, like labor/management disputes under a collective bargaining agreement.

In arbitration, the filing fees are much higher, AND the parties have to pay high rates for the arbitrators, so none of the arbitrations in which I participated turned out to be any cheaper than I would have expected a trial to be.  Most expensive of all is the loss of predictability that a well-drawn contract is supposed to provide.

Here in Texas (and likely in your jurisdiction as well) arbitrators are free to ignore the carefully negotiated contract and just do whatever they think is fair.  So if your contract contains an arbitration clause, there's not much point in negotiating any other terms.

Arbitrators have a powerful financial incentive to rule in favor of the side most likely to be a repeat customer, and that is consistent with my arbitration experience.  That's a HUGE advantage for the stock brokerage in a FINRA dispute, or the big corporation dealing with consumer issues -- nevermind that the high starting costs and arbitrator fees (let alone remote locations) make an effective barrier against smaller claims.

It moves very slowly and gently into each build up, without moving us much from the place we were before. Many of the synth lines have good ideas, but I feel like you could have refined it and expanded on the best parts, rather than playing through and keeping the best improvised take, which is what it sounds like to me.

You've got good ideas, and a good feel for what works, and a good start, but I think you're ready to take the next step and taking a little more risk in your approach to structure and composition.

So in Jewish liturgy, the Torah is read with a variety of chant systems.  They have fixed musical motifs that are applied to words or phrases (depending on the system).  Each of the musical pieces has a name and symbol, which are written out in Hebrew biblical texts.  They serve as punctuation of sorts, to mark sentences, phrases, etc.  The difference is that it's associated with words (or phrases) themselves, not in between them.

However, the Torah itself is written only with the consonantal text--no vowel markings, no chant markings.  And unless the reader's Hebrew is quite solid, they need to know the reading to punctuate it on-the-fly.  And even then it can be tricky, since inserting both vowels and punctuation can be confusing.

Enter the trope signal!  Torah readers have two people who check their reading from a printed book, rather than the Torah, correcting them as needed.  With trope signalling, they indicate what each word's musical sequence is (or each phrase, in some systems).  The result is that the reader, by looking at the hand signals while they read, can easily know how to chant the text.

It's not easy, though.  Besides having a thorough knowledge of the tropes themselves and the hand signals, you have to be able to convert one to the other quickly and easily.  More importantly, you have to have the right rhythm--the trope needs to be signaled early enough so that the reader knows what each word is before he has to start chanting it, but not so early that they won't know which word goes with which signal.

Because both the reader and the reading-checker have to know it to use it, knowledge of this is increasingly rare.  People usually just prepare readings, since even if they know the signals, they can't be sure someone else will to ""throw trope"".  And when readers don't all know it, the whole thing falls apart.

So the only people who know it or use it are more experienced Torah readers, who have had occasion to learn it.  It makes preparation required for chanting nearly nil.  But with so few people who know it, it's hardly worthwhile.  Being an experienced Torah reader, I know the signals.  But apart from a few friends from my hometown who taught me, I don't know many who know it.  I couldn't walk into a synagogue and assume someone could signal me.

To make things more complicated, Torah chant is almost exclusively learned aurally.  You learn by listening, mimicking, and being corrected, not from a written text (though people have written up chant in musical notation, it's rare to learn that way).  This means it's a second-layer of inherited knowledge that someone has to find someone to teach them.

I, for example, have never seen a written guide to hand signals--I learned it from a friend, and by seeing a couple others doing it.  And my Torah chanting in general is from systematic teaching by repetition and mimicking my dad's chanting, and listening and copying others for chants on other things.  People (including me) often use recordings to learn it, but don't learn it from sheet music.  It's a rather interesting modern example of unwritten knowledge.

I had to move 3500km to do it, but I've been working in my field (property assessment) since Fall 2011. I only have one student loan left (mine), and the total debt is now down to $30k. It will be gone by the Fall of 2015, slowed down only by needing a family car soon enough because getting a car seat out of a three door hatchback isn't something I want to do.

As to what to do with your money, I would suggest doing a significant amount of market research and investing in the right piece of real estate, either to use as a starter home down payment or the  beginning of a nest egg for an investment property."

1) That indie games wont become more popular than AAA

and

2) That AAA wont go away.

For your first point, Indie has pretty much taken over the market. Look at mobile gaming. How many of the 1000's of popular and successful games on mobile platforms are Indie, compared to how few are AAA. Mobile gaming is currently one of the biggest markets right now, and is dominated by Indie titles with cheap prices.

Secondly, you argue that AAA wont go away. I agree with you to a certain extent, but I think you're forgetting how a company becomes a AAA releasing studio. They start off Indie, and slowly become more and more popular."

The issue here is that we don't know how much of a spoiler the whole 'rainbow' thing *is*. That's up for debate. However, if it *is*, and the rainbow thing stems from a future episode, then any references to it should be kept from those who would rather not know. In my opinion, anyway."

I had the same problem with some of my jeans when I gained a few pounds, but trying on a pair a single waist size larger almost completely eliminated the problem and made me look more masculine around the hip area. 

Edit:

Also, looks like you're wearing them a bit high. Keep them at the widest party of your hips. There should be an inch or two of fabric not touching your crotch. Lack of equipment of any size is really obvious when you look, and unfortunately being curvy is going to draw attention to the area. 

Are you locking your knees in this pic? Don't do that. Not only is it bad for circulation, it emphasizes the curves. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart but knees slightly bent/not locked. Takes some getting used to but it'll make your stance more masculine and natural.

There's not much you can do about the face except shave your hairline. Guys trans to have a more defined hairline and often shaving of the fluff hair can drastically masculine your face.

You even see whole demographics who use this tactic to get their way in every day life, or even on reddit.  Get loud enough, indignant enough, angry enough, the thought is that you can make people back down.

How to keep a person who is deflecting on track:  have a plan.  Work out with your housemates a reasonable plan ahead of time.

perhaps steve can do what he wants at all other hours except between 5-9pm.  (or whatever)  but from 5-9pm the internet has to be equally available to all who equally pay for it.  

Go to steve with whatever reasonable plan you work out at your house meeting.  (if you don't start having household meetings, now is a good time)  Making one of you (the firmest volunteer) the lead, present your plan to steve.  be firm.  keep on target.  Don't respond to 'buts', as in 'but Mary doesn't do her dishes', etc.  If steve starts that, keep it on target by saying 'we are not discussing mary, but we can do that at a future time if you want to bring it to the next meeting.  We are discussing internet use, and this is the plan.  We pay for the internet equally, so we have an equal say in it, and we get to have it equally available to us to use it. We are going to take a vote now.

then vote.  sure, he'lll probably get pissed.  he'll throw a tantrum.  but stick to your logical premise that this is fair and equal and DONT get drawn into responding to any points he throws in just to create argument.

The ear flap is closed a lot of the time, trapping in moisture and bacteria, so cropping ""opens"" the ear and therefore disallows any buildup. Some breeds are extremely susceptible to ear infections because of this, enough that extra care and periodic drying/cleaning doesn't cut it.

Don't be afraid. Save the money you would've spent on kids and spend it on long term care insurance. Spend the time you would've spent on kids on making lots of good, solid friendships with people in many different generations so that your friends aren't all dead when you're old.

I suppose as American and New Yorker, the closest parallel I can think of is the disgust I feel when I see a confederate flag, but that really doesn't come close.

Obviously there was less chance to talk to people on the internet then.  It kind of made me a euroskeptic, because I would always say to myself ""If the people within these countries hate each other, how can all the countries work together?""  I suppose the answer would be for devolution of some nation states into smaller nations (Scotland, Basque country, Catalonia, etc.) and all of these under the umbrella of the EU.

The lack of employment is actually partially because of the asthma because I am having, on average, 4 big asthma attacks a day, and more when I'm active. 2 weeks ago I ran out of my inhaler and I've been using the over-the-counter pill Bronkaid, which is no where near as good as albuterol.

Do you have any recommendations for what I can do to fight attacks other than taking this pill?  I ask because, while the pill is fine if I catch my asthma attack in time, if it has gotten to be too severe an attack, the pill does nothing."

The ""My First PC"" analogy is great. 8.1 is great for the masses in some ways, but not so much for power users who tend toward minimal and accessibility, let alone function. What they stripped out and didn't add vs. what they kept and did add is much more consumer oriented. Some improvements there, but nothing an overhaul deliver on promise.

Most of the debate centers around the interface. That shows how far down most users dig on their PC's There's a lot under the hood that's lacking. They didn't have us in mind.

For my workflow, I just redid the office and moved things to other computers that used to be on my PC workstation because Windows 8.1 is no longer optimal for those tasks anymore. Some bare POSIX support to communicate to other boxes is about all I care to do now. The rest of my POSIX development flow as well as typical server services, etc., will be on other machines.

OriginalStomper,law,1389140510.0,"&gt;Unconscionability is not about whether it's a good deal, but about whether the contracting parties had the opportunities to properly judge what was in their own best interests.
&gt;Were the employees misled, lacked information, under legal duress (not just ""I needed a job""), or misunderstood the terms?
&gt;That's unconscionability. 

Texas is not known to be plaintiff-oriented these days, but Texas law disagrees with your narrow definition of ""unconscionability.""

&gt;“Unconscionability is to be determined in light of a variety of factors, which aim to prevent oppression and unfair surprise; in general, a contract will be found unconscionable if it is grossly one-sided.”  .”  *In re Poly-America*, 262 S.W.3d 337, 348 (Tex. 2008)(orig. proceeding).

The contract in *Poly-America* included the employee's waiver of certain statutory remedies.  The Texas Supreme Court held that waiver was unconscionable and unenforceable because it violated public policy as expressed in the Texas Worker's Compensation Act.

The Texas Supreme Court also recognized that two other provisions are potentially unconscionable in application, but not unconscionable *per se*, and so held that the arbitrator is free to modify or disregard these provisions if their effect would be unconscionable.  Those provisions (a) required the employee to split arbitration costs with the employer, and (b) limited available discovery.  *Id*. at 358."

YoungFolks,AskWomen,1389141289.0,"Similar note, ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE ON LITTLE KIDS. My brother was a right Houdini as a kid. He would just wander away and could get pretty far if no one was looking. Once almost lost him at an airport terminal when he wandered into a different gate's wait area. Another time we stopped off at a small rural village on vacation, and he wanted of in the confusion of disembarking/using the facilities and was nowhere in sight. Luckily some old shop owners had seen a 2 year old walking around and corralled him, and sent someone to look for the parents. Oh, and when I was about 3, my friend and I decided to go to school like kids in cartoons, so we packed up backpacks full of toys and books, said bye to our moms who were gossiping in the kitchen, and left the house. We were wandering around the neighborhood making random turns for a pretty long time apparently.

The price for the Alpha is $30 dollars, but it is discounted from $40 for the beta and $50 for the full version at release. This is account for the unfinished product. So you are only paying a fraction of what the game is worth and getting a fraction of the content.

Also DayZ isn't really an indie game. It's developed and published by Bohemia Interactive which, while it self publishes it's game, has enough affluence to be able to do that. It's like saying Blizzard is an indie studio."

The frequencies, even though the same, can be a little off and ""roll"" by each other.

The only solution is to provide a sync signal so you don't see what you don't want. The rolling bar is the black vertical interval.

Now Costco on the other hand... Their Kirkland Signature ""American style"" Vodka (no idea what it means, but it got me drunk all the same) was $20 for a HG after tax.

Someone selling an NES set at their church's summer social probably isn't going to research the value on eBay; the guy running a pawn shop in a low-income area likely views games as an insignificant part of his store's operations, and prices them accordingly.

I'm a triathlete and what I've found works best for me is to try to swim on days when I'd be ""washing"" my hair anywhere so it's at maximum oiliness when I swim. I feel like it gets damaged less this way--similar to the logic behind hair dye boxes saying to wait 24-48 hours after washing to use the dye.

Anyway, I get it soaking wet in the locker shower before entering the pool. It takes a good 2-3 minutes for me to feel like it's completely absorbed into my hair. Then I bun it up and wear a rubber swim cap. Caps don't keep the water out, but they greatly reduce the amount that's just freely flowing through your hair. Make sure you pull it down over your ears for max coverage. Try to keep your flip turns tight to reduce the amount of time that you're upside down.

In the end, swimming in the pool leaves my hair with a slightly off texture (a little stiff), but it looks the same and doesn't seem to need washing any more/less often."

[Here](http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/WHO%20Report%20on%20Chernobyl%20Health%20Effects%20July%2006.pdf) is the WHO report on Chernobyl from 2006. It analyzes the effects of the fallout in a very detailed manner.

[Here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3016.1993.tb00388.x/abstract), [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/075333229190023M), and [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1415387) are studies on the effects of the chernobyl fallout on the rate of birth defects in Europe.

The conclusions of the studies above is that the Chernobyl accident will cause, at the very most, 5000 cancer deaths among the most exposed 6 million people  and that there is no apparent increase in birth defects that can be attributed to the Accident in the fallout hit areas of Europe.

So the claim in the film that the accident ""Destroyed 9 million lives"" is a steaming pile of alarmist bullshit."

Actually, I just want people to accept gender roles and not criticize non-conformers or conformers. For example, despite gender parity being pushed for and incentivized in Western countries, most engineers are still men and most nurses women. I don't think this is particularly bad or evidence of institutional sexism. Actually, my male roommate is a nurse; although he is generally respected for his choice, he just accepts nurses will be predominantly women. He doesn't need to be praised or chastised for his choice.

I don't think we need to have quotas or encourage people to break barriers; it's having the choice that's important. It's unrealistic to think every job and role in society will or should be 50%/50% men and women."

I started very small - meditating for just five minutes a day - a worked my way up to 30 min. I also tracked my progress to remind myself how far I'd come and get a little self-esteem boost. The timer is great because whenever I started to feel anxious and lose focus on my breath, I'd remind myself that the timer would go off soon enough and return to taking slow, deep breaths.

He even said that he had another *lover* (I assumed someone he dated, no big) and then he saw me a few more times. What he didn't tell me is that he lived with his girlfriend in her home and they'd been exclusive for over 1 year. Not a rebound but she dumped him. He's still lurking on the Cupid as single.

*Rebound*: Guy discusses how everyone he's ever dated and even his ex wife has Borderline Personality Disorder. Never finished a drink so fast in my life. He was talking a lot about a 20 year old he was last dating with BPD. He was 42.

*Rebound*: Listed as single on OKCupid a while back. I didn't think I'd be attracted to him, which I dunno how to say I wasn't when we did date (it was a bad time in my life, really), but anyhow after sex with him he lets me know he's still married ON PAPER ONLY for the insurance. Up until a week before we met though he was working with her to get them into marriage therapy to save it. Also his polyamorous playmate girlfriend dumped him about that time and months later I learned she was 16 when they met; 18 when he began fucking her (suuuuure) and he's 37 now. I guess he was 33 then? Anyhow, I don't play jealous girl but he would just sit there texting his WIFE or taking calls from her whenever I was around which was rude. Once she called him at like 1am when I was there to ask if she could swing by to see if one of her dollies was at the house. I was there.

There is a difference between a feminist and an equal opportunist. You sound like an equal opportunist, and I am almost sure you do not want to associate yourself with 'feminists', because firstly, it's from the word 'female', thus having a start bias; secondly, it sounds like a help group, and thirdly it can go to an extreme.

I could go on about women's roles and men's roles in society but I will not because that's not what the thread is about. What I will say is that if you ask a guy out, or specifically me, (before my view was changed), I would assume that you were paying. (I mean asking a person out without knowing them for more than a month, no friendship just good acquaintances).

Uhh.. I don't think it's the fact that they are paying for your company, but that a person is paying ... for your time and attention in that little instance to gain some sort of trust. Trust shouldn't be easy to gain, imo."

I'd actually argue that there's some evidence that there were similar dances.  The Talmud has references to some sort of celebratory dance performed in honor of the bride at weddings, and it's a near-universal feature of Jewish communities later on.  I think this indicates that it's likely ancient Judea had some form of wedding dance.

Obviously, it wasn't Dabke, since nothing I can find indicates anything other than it being an Arab dance.  But Jesus doing a similar wedding dance would not be unlikely."

* Contour powder  
* Face primer  
* Eye primer

Of course, this makes it hard for me to debate people when we're talking about, for example, the lack of women in the government. Anti-feminists tend to say that maybe the lack of women in government stems from a natural female disinclination to jobs like being in Congress, but if you, like me, believe that gender is just a bunch of arbitrary values that we force on people based on their genitals, then you can see why this is a frustrating argument that takes just so much energy to even deconstruct the issues with it.

Then again I'm a pretty heavy subscriber to postmodernism. All truth being relative, I really don't know why I like debating so much, since what's true for me isn't true for the people who debate me.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389145185.0,"Running journals costs money.  A lot of money.  They're highly profitable exercises too, but most research is very narrowly targeted at a handful of academics who will actually read it, and the costs to have people who will keep track of them and manage reviews, editing and general publishing are quite high per paper.   Journals also keep track of things  like how many other journal articles reference your  paper and how many reference those papers etc. in an effort to construct an impact factor.  

Journals are  run by private companies, hence they charge for it.  There's a big push right now in academia in general and for the 'muricans that publicly funded research should be public, with open access journals etc.  That sounds good, but someone needs to pay for it then.  

The general intention, as other people say, is to have  institutional subscriptions, and many professors host  links to their papers on their own personal websites  (or some of their  papers at least).  

Research papers are not generally aimed at the public, they're aimed at experts.  Unlike say legal documents or treaties or the like which have longwinded preambles defining terms and spending a lot of time being clear about what they mean, the  presumption with journals is that you're already trained in the field, so in many cases they don't make a whole lot of sense to someone who doesn't at least have a 3 or 4 years of education in the field (and oftentimes they still don't make sense unless you're a specialist in that narrow area).

Some university libraries will let members of the public buy cards and computer access, so you can get in that way.  I'm not really sure on the cost as I get access as  both  an employee at 2 places and an alumni at 2 others.  "

They're just crawling around collecting food for one another, though, none of them are having sex. She said, ""how would you like it if a bully killed you with a magnifying glass?""

""Not much at all."" I answered back.

What was I to do on a summer day? Certainly not play with the boy down the street who likes to hold other kids to the ground and threaten them with spiting on their face. I heard his mother died when she choked on a bon-bon watching soap operas. The neighborhood boys were't going to spit on themselves. Roasting ants seems like the natural thing to do for a young boy like myself. It is in my nature to kill things and pretend that I am a God to the small creatures. Having the knowledge that it is wrong and the power to kill them is gratifying. Whether I do it or not doesn't matter, but the fact that I could is just...

I stared at the ant hill and studied their movements. One ant would venture out to the world until he discovered a suitable blade of grass and turned back and then a solid line of ants would follow the exact same line, no matter how curved and wavy, to the same blade and dismantled it with another bite. This continued until the blade disappeared and another ant ventured out for the next blade. On and on, this happened. When would it end? Until the whole yard was consumed and overrun with ants and their stupid hills? But I can be an assertive God. I can stop the massacre here and now.

I walked to the ant hill and stomped it. It felt good. I looked around concerned my mother had seen me. I looked to the sky to see the streak of the missile as it reentered the atmosphere. It was like they said in school. I am not a God, I am the ant."

Sometimes people just have problems and sometimes people aren't bad but the situations has kinda gotten to a non-recoverable point where it's not really possible to save anymore and a hard cut is best. It's something you have to deal with as an admin sometimes. 

If the situation (in the game/on the server etc) really enrages that person maybe in a really roundabout way you could be doing them a favor by forcing them away. I have just met a lot of people of either gender who can just get obsessed with a situation and fighting it out (like on a forum/message board, or just think of the Phil Fish situation) sometimes distance/a change of scenery can really be the best thing even if it is forced on one. Maybe they'll find another server and eventually be happier there. 

For the record, I'd like to think that no, it's not that common for players to act this way, but you can't discount the potential. So if it were to happen and you have looked at the situation and there really is no basis and nothing in a potetial misunderstanding that could be cleared up kind of way, just treat them like any other belligerent person and bann them for disrespecting the mod. 

=&gt; That said, maybe there is somebody with more active mod experience here who can weigh in and make sure I'm not dispensing bullshit advice =&gt; I've never been a mod in a major place I've just been a community member on various more heavily populated and modded places and that was my impression of the stuff they have to deal with and how they deal with it and how loops back to the health of the community.

Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389145797.0,"A lot of people feel like that in high school. It's part of being a teenager, really. If you think it's more than that, find someone to talk to - depression can suck the motivation right out of you. In the meantime, find yourself a reason to put your best effort into classes. Find the value in what you're learning, or be defiant and show the administration you're better than they think you are. By the time you graduate you'll be in a position to choose where you want to go - maybe it's college, maybe it's not, but having good grades and a hobby or side project will show that you're capable of doing whatever it is you want.

And don't stress too much about planning your whole future yet. Things change, people change, and it's much better to give yourself options.

daisyismydog,RandomActsofMakeup,1389145972.0,"No problem! I just realized that since I don't normally use these things I forgot to include them: powder (I would put this in the second category) and setting spray (which I would put in the last category). I have dehydrated skin so I don't generally need help with staying power so I don't use an all-over face powder. I'm thinking about getting a setting spray though because apparently the difference is that you can touch your face and not worry about it rubbing off which would be nice :) 

I would definitely recommend getting a makeup remover because regular face washes don't generally get things that are water-resistant off completely, and you'll want something that is eye-safe regardless. I'm a big fan of using oil as a makeup remover/first-step cleanser because I double cleanse (once with oil, and then with a regular face wash/cleansing milk). There's also a sidebar list under the Holy Grail category for ""Removers"" (Week 5) that you may check out!

Bronzer can be used for contouring depending on your skin tone (~MAC NC30 in foundation and around there would probably have good success using bronzer for contouring). The intended purpose of bronzer is to mimic the tan you would get/add some color and/or for an all-over glow (hence why a lot of bronzers have shimmer in them, but for contouring you'll want something matte because shadows don't sparkle). 

Most skin tones would probably be better off not using a bronzer for contouring because when you're contouring you're trying to mimic the shadows that would be cast on your face (imagine a lamp above your head highlighter your nose bridge, cheek bones, etc. but casting shadows elsewhere). In natural light and good lighting (not yellow lighting) the shadows that are cast are generally cool-toned with more grey in them than brown/orange. The reason some people are able to use bronzer to contour successfully is that their skin tone is warm (NC = neutral-cool but MAC is weird so their ""cool"" is everyone else's warm) and on the darker side so it won't show up orange-y on them.

He keeps throwing me around and pinning me because he's big and strong (every time he takes the opportunity to grind his rock hard cock all over me), but I manage to get him in a body scissors while he's on his back. I clench my thighs together, making him squirm around trying to get free... Leaving his legs wide open. SLAP! My fingertips crash down past his erection right into his exposed testicles, then wrap around the base of his sack, exposing his balls further and making him moan. SLAP! My other palm smacks down on top of his nuts, and I easily grab hold and begin to squeeze them against each other, making him gasp sharply before he means again. His legs are tense now, but they quickly weaken and his knees draw together under my unrelenting grip. With one hand, I pulse my squeeze and experiment with different spots to apply pressure with my thumb. The other hand is now rubbing his sweaty chest, drawing little circles with my fingernails until he can't take my grip anymore and he says he gives. I pretend not to hear (I'm such a bitch!) , and ask him to repeat himself, but every time he tries, I squeeze harder and lick or suck the tip of his cock, interrupting him by forcing him to moan in agony and ecstasy. Eventually he gets it out again, despite my fingertips digging into his testicles and my tongue flicking circles around his cock head. I maneuver into a 69, relaxing my grip to maintain some firm warning ""presence"". My lips, tongue, and other hand work his shaft, licking, sucking, stroking. He comes as I deep throat him and take all of him in. He doesn't let this stop the great job he's doing. As I near my own climax, I release his manhood and grip his thighs, pushing them wider so I can maintain balance for my getting-close convulsions. Right when I'm about to explode, SLAP! One more stiff whack and rough squeeze, making him writhe underneath me pleasurably, while his moans release delicious vibrations into me. When I'm done with my orgasm, I let go and climb off him. He whimpers softly and curls up on his side, so I big-spoon him even though I'm smaller, plant soft kisses on his shoulders and neck, and we drift off into sleep (although I probably should go pee before I do this) with (of course) a peaceful angelic smile on my face. 

Yeah. This one scenario, if done ""by the book"", is basically my whole bucket list. I just need to find a guy who, like my ex, likes this stuff, but... Isn't my ex. And preferably looks like the love child of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Gosling. With a tongue like Gene Simmons. And a cock like a porn star (I don't watch porn, so I don't have a name to drop there, lol). "
sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389146359.0,"The complex answer is: it depends on your  circumstances.  For a country like the UK before devolution, that didn't have states/provinces/sub countries a target of something like 0-1% would have made perfect sense.  You need to not undershoot and  hit deflation but a  number greater than but close to  0 is good because most rebalancing is handled through fiscal policy (government spending). 

For a country like the unites states, with many different regions that are constantly in flux relative to each other a target of something like 3 or 4% can make sense, the US federal government is modestly sized, so if california runs 5% inflation  and wyoming 1% you end up changing costs relative to each other, even though they're both stuck on the same currency.

The Euro area - where the central government is virtually non existent then an even higher inflation target can be desirable - if spain needs to make up a 20% gap in valuation relative to germany even at 4 or 5% eurozone inflation a year it could easily take 10 years for a 20% gap to be closed (if say, germany had  5% inflation and spain 3% the gap would only shrink at 2% a year).  

It's mathy though, and it depends on the details of fiscal transfer arrangements.  "

There's also volunteer groups that go out looking for homeless people, I did one a few years ago during similar weather.

Dystaxia,AskReddit,1389146612.0,"There is an important distinction to make between debates and arguments. By how you regard others here on Reddit, YouTube, or your forum, you are pushing people away. People don't offer reasoned criticisms of your views because they feel their views are already dismissed. You don't seem open to changing your position, only looking for confrontation. They don't avoid an engagement because they feel any less passionate about their position or they are overwhelmed by the points you make; people don't want to debate you because you're verbally abusive.

I applaud you voicing your opinion with such vigor but you're not going to produce any sort of thought provoking discussion if you actively offend those with views contradictory to your own. Provocation and insults will not stimulate the kind of discussion you desire. The more contraversial the dissenting opinion, the more personable your behaviour must be. Typically, people willing to entertain these discussions will only do so if they share your outlook. Without encouraging a conflicting opinion, the discussion is fated to become an echo chamber.

You seem like a very driven and passionate person by how much effort you have put into your website but you're also extremely angry and lashing out at people. I wish you the best and hope that you can eventually come to terms with what appears to be deeply rooted motivations."

You should be fine just using a regular primer though :) You don't need to use a certain kind of brush, but I find using a stiffer one to set down the shadow helps because you want to pat instead of swipe so a stiffer brush is nice for precise placement. You can definitely use a fluffy one though!

For using the sample bags, I shake most of the shadow to the bottom of the bag and then use the tiny little bit that is stuck to the side of the bag, tapping off into the bag to help reduce fallout. I find that if I don't do this and just dunk my brush into the shadow it's a powdery nightmare D= I think the Shiro's CoTMs come with sifters, right? For the jars I generally just dip a little corner of my brush into it.

They said ""congrats you're pregnant"" and sent me home... still in pain, with nothing to do but wait and see if this baby stuck.

Unfortunately there isn't much that they can do for you.  Even if they bring you in and run all the tests they'll end up sending you home to see if it sticks or not.  There's just nothing they can do, nothing they can really check, things are too variable at the beginning to give you answers.  Even if they monitor you constantly, they won't be able to do anything if you miscarry again.

I suspect that their 3.5 weeks is based on the date of conception, not LMP.  Which would put you at closer to 5.5 weeks by typical counting.  Otherwise it's obviously wrong, like you said.

Unless you have any kind of symptoms I'm afraid my best suggestion is to find your zen and wait it out.  I found out super early after my miscarriage and I know how hard it is.  The good news is that miscarriages happen and they don't *mean* anything, so you are probably fine."

Oops! No corkscrew. I remembered this nifty trick from the internet and tried it on the inside wall of the door jamb. No luck. I figured if I hit it any harder something would break and that wouldn't be good.

So I grabbed my power drill and a medium sized screw from the garage, drilled it into the cork about 3/4 of the way in and then clamped some vice grips around the head of the screw. Popped that fucker out in no time. Then drank a bottle of shitty wine, problem solved. A regular screwdriver and plyers would have worked too.

Let's just say that your body is a very complicated system of a lot of things working together, and if you manipulate certain parts of that system through chemicals (medicine), you can achieve a certain effect. For example, an antibiotic kills harmful bacteria living in your system, which still stop the effects of that harmful bacteria.

Smokeahontas,MakeupAddiction,1389148039.0,"This is my routine I do pretty much every morning before work:

* Splash my face with lukewarm water. Pat dry, and apply CeraVe moisturizing cream. 

* Put chapstick on. 

* Put Nars Smudge Proof Pro Prime on my eyelids and smoosh it all in. Let dry a minute or so.

* Slap on some NYX Milk and rub that on as a base for color. 

* Next up is eyeshadow. Lately this has been a combination of shadows from Naked 3. My favorite combination for daytime looks is Burnout all over my lid, Factory in the outer v, all blended out with either Nooner or Liar with my MAC 217. Strange goes on the inner corners with my fingertip.

* Then I put on eyeliner. Always at least a small wing, but usually a little bigger. I use Stila Stay All Day in black or the ELF cream liner in black applied with an angled brush. 

* Mascara is my trusty Clump Crusher. Two coats, and I comb through if necessary -- though I rarely have to. 

* Slap on my Smashbox bb cream with my fingers. Let it set for a second. 

* Lightly buff on Bare Minerals in medium beige all over with their Heavenly Face brush. 

* Light contour in the hollows of my cheeks with NYX matte bronzer. I initially thought it would be too orangey on me, but it actually looks pretty shadowy against my skin. 

* Blush in Nars Liberte.

* Highlighter in Nars Albatross on the tops of my cheekbones. 

* Now it's brow time: my favorite.  After combing through my brows with a spoolie, I use Benefit Brow Zings. With the angled brush it comes with, I outline the shape of my brow. Then, with a separate eyebrow brush, I fill in with the powder. Then I sweep the clear stuff from Anastasia over them. 

* Highlight with Albatross under brows. 

* Finally, I sweep Hourglass Ambient Lighting powder in Dim Light all over my face with a big fluffy brush.

Whew!                                   "

Also once in a while I like to watch some of that sensual shit where 2 or 3 girls are doing it real classy like. Just depends on the day.

I'm not really into anal sex myself anymore, it was a taboo back when I was married but I've gotten it out of my system since and I'm fine with regular sex. But watching it is really dirty and that's pretty specific to why I'm watching porn in the first place. Actual sex is a completely different dynamic, it's about two people pleasing each other. Porn has a single purpose, to unleash my sexual thoughts through physical expulsion, the dirtier the better sometimes. But when I'm actually with a girl I focus on our mutual pleasure, soft and slow, hard and fast, some light spanking, and some dirty talk to get in her head and bring her to climax. Porn and sex are two completely different things for me and my partner should understand that."

it's hard to describe! i had to ask my husband to borrow his ball for a sec haha. you know how you have to softly squeeze an avocado to see whether or not it's ripe? massaging balls is kind of like that. you want to take the whole thing in your hand and let it rest against the soft, fleshy part of your palm and then curl your fingers around it. you can massage the taint with your index and middle fingers (or not) and then gently move your thumb against the ball and just repeat that with whatever intensity is asked for. hope that helps! :) just remember to experiment and communicate, that's how i figured all this stuff out"

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389150402.0,"I'm going to go against the crowd and say I don't think it is worth it for you.  I have a membership and use it occasionally, but the tricky thing is that most of the stuff there is BULK.  You have to be able to afford to buy a months worth of X item and Y item to make it worthwhile, which is extremely difficult if you're strapped for cash.  I've been there, we could stretch a long way on generic brands and pasta, but not bulk shopping.  **Basically it is not worth it unless you have the cash flow to use it effectively**.

However, if you have a friend with a membership you can go shopping with them and just pay for your own items (there are some restrictions on payment methods).  There are different levels of membership and generally 2 cards per household but that can be fudged a bit.  But I wouldn't recommend laying out for your own membership until you can afford to really take advantage of shopping there."

sir_sri,AskMen,1389150446.0,"kinda depends on the age range we're talking about here.

Under 22 or 23 and women (and men I think) are still figuring out who they are and how to be comfortable in their own selves and finding what they want in life.

By the mid 30's  though... the ones that want to be crazy have 10 years of experience at being really really crazy.  Really really really really really crazy.  

Everyones  life experience is different, and that shapes  who they are, young people are generally in better physical  shape and that has its advantages, but by their  30's they know what  they  do and  don't  like generally, and that helps a lot.  People in their 30's who got the wrong end of a relationship with  someone who discovered they wanted someone else can be really jaded or really awesome, there's no one rule of thumb.  

Much older than that and you're into women who are primarily worried about their kids and career and their needs and you either are  part of that or you aren't, and they don't have the time or inclination to put up with your bullshit, or to invest in you either.

sparklekitteh,exchristian,1389150804.0,"I grew up Presbyterian, quite liberal, and studied sociology/anthropology in college, and got along fine framing the Bible as a document positioned in the cultural understanding of the time. It eventually occurred to me, though, that while you could maybe explain Jesus' ""casting out of demons"" as maybe curing epilepsy, and give Paul's mysogyny a pass because of gender roles at the turn of the epoch... you can't do that with the death and resurrection of Christ. That event pretty much has to be taken literally for Christianity to ""work"" and you can't explain it away like you can the other stuff. I think that realization, more than anything, was what really let me accept my doubts and questions.

The second big piece also came along with my liberalism. I had tried hard to use my faith for social justice and the bottom line of ""love everybody, no matter what, because God loves everybody."" But with so many high-profile Christian groups and leaders doing exactly the opposite (WBC, Pat Robertson, anti-choice groups, anti-marriage-equality folks, etc.), I found myself having to constantly repeat, ""not all Christians are like that,"" and explain why I thought one could follow the gist of the Bible without being a judgmental jerk. So I did a lot of thinking, and a lot of reading, and in a weird way realized that those hot-air-bags had a point: maybe you COULDN'T be a ""good Christian"" without being that kind of jerk, and if that's the case, then count me out.

dewprisms,confession,1389150806.0,"A *lot* of people are scared about dentist stuff, it's not uncommon. You can get sedatives if procedures scare you that much- the dentist just needs to know beforehand in case you need special instructions (how far ahead to not eat, etc.)

Your anxiety will rule you until you get help. Some things you cannot overcome on your own simply because you don't have all the tools to do it yourself. Someone needs to help you find the tools. And that's okay! No one knows everything. At this point, your anxiety about getting help is only making the anxiety worse. There's nothing wrong with seeking help.

You can move past this, it will just require work. Remember that the longer you go without fixing your dental issues, the worse and more expensive it comes. It can also become life threatening in some cases. If you can get your anxiety in check, your life will move back towards being on track, and you can start ensuring that you keep up well with preventative care with your mouth."

&gt;It is the view of the current authors that they and other critics of male circumcision tend to misrepresent the evidence and cite selective sources out of context, leading them to refute the extensive scientific support for the ability of male circumcision to reduce the risk of HIV infection and a range of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and their female partners without adverse effects on sexual function, sensation or satisfaction...

&gt;There is no shortage of scientific evidence on the protection against HIV conferred by male circumcision...

I don't know if this will help at all with your dislike of ballparks but the other thing you can do is figure out a window for yourself.  You had a positive HPT 2 weeks ago, check the brand, but typically that puts you at a minimum of 1 week past your expected period, approximately 2 weeks before that would be ovulation and conception would be within a few days of that (most likely), and a typical LMP would be approximately 2 weeks before that.  So by my math (today - 2 weeks - 1 week - 2 weeks - 2 weeks) that estimate puts you at approximately 7 weeks.  That might seem too long but since you didn't have an LMP the timing actually works out that you would have ovulated about a week after you stopped bleeding from the miscarriage or around December 3.  That puts you a little farther along than what I assumed the nurse meant, but we could do the same sort of calculation based on the date they last did bloodwork to narrow it down too. 

I know I'm just a stranger on the internet, but that's where I'd put my money, about 7 weeks.  Which guesstimates your due date at about August 26.  It's still a ballpark, but at least there is solid math and science behind it!

rainbowplethora,thatHappened,1389152027.0,"Well, like I said, there are a couple of Italians who wrote very similar stories around the 1500s (I think). The French stories you're thinking of were probably those of Charles Perrault, who wrote a bunch of cool stories. I believe he is credited with the first version of Cinderella. The Brothers Grimm started collecting and transcribing folk tales, or Märchen, in the 1800s-ish. Plenty of people think that these were common stories told to children, but the truth is, very few of them can be traced back to their individual origin. It is very possible that some had been around since the renaissance. Some of them are very clearly full of morals for children and it's plausible they were used to teach kids long long before any similar story was written down. Some of them (like the Bremen Town Musicians, which is a pointless story that reeks of /r/thathappened) were probably made up by someone who heard the Grimma were coming to their town collecting stories and thought ""If I make up a great story, all the men will buy me Bier and all the Frauleins will think I'm sehr cool"". Point is, we don't know. This is all based on some study I did a few years ago, so anyone is free to fact check me.

How long do you think your gf and you could do a LDR? If it's less than a year, could you be at places your gf likes to visit at a 4 and 8 month mark, so you two can do part of the trip together? Or do you want to be single and feel totally free on your trip?

If you were consistently getting 100 CS/10 minutes at silver you would be getting so fed relative to your lane opponent you would pretty much never lose a game.

cudtastic,miamidolphins,1389152511.0,"Yeah, I 100% agree with you. People shat on Sherman so much, but Philbin was his boss. Why does Sherman get all the blame and Philbin none?

The main thing people often mention is he held the team together through bullygate. From my point of view, bullygate was actually the reason the team played with passion up until the last couple games. They were pissed off that the media was saying the locker room was screwed up and there were no leaders, and that the media was playing the whole thing up so much. Them against the world. This was right before the Bucs game; after that loss, they proceeded to go 4-1 (with one close loss to the Panthers) prior to collapsing the last 2.

So I give Philbin little to no credit for ""holding the team together through adversity."" I do blame him for poor adjustments across the season and during the game. Just like I blame Sherman, and Coyle (though to a lesser extent; the D was pretty good this year despite regression of run D). And I especially blame him for gutting the team of leaders as you mentioned.

How else do you describe how inconsistent we were all season, other than coaching? If it was a lack of talent, why did we go 4-1 against the AFC playoff teams? But then lose to the Bills x2, Jets, Bucs, etc.?"

If someone were to look at my old old journals they may think I had a miserable life, but, while I have gone through very hard times, I was also using the journal to vent during those times. I wasn't taking the time to write, 'Today I had an awesome dinner out with Mom and Dad! My meal was delicious!' I WAS taking the time to write when I was depressed, scared, lonely, etc.  So while turning to journals to look at what you were feeling at the time is nice, we also have to consider that we may tend to write about specific topics because we use the journal as an outlet and not because those topics are the sole things in our lives at the time."

One of the worst part about that job was having to store the CRT monitors in the attic of the building, which was only accessible via a steep, narrow ladder. Hauling those up there by the dozen was hard. So what did we do?

I think this made him at ease to know that I wasn't super in love with him and we could remain friendly. His birthday was about 2 weeks after the break up so it gave me an excuse to text him shortly after. When we were together we had made a list of restaurants that we wanted to try - so about every three months or so we'll get together and still try one out. We don't have any mutual friends so it's not like I'll bump into him- one of us will have to make the effort to contact one another. I didn't see him for about 3 months after the break up but there were still some texts. 

I haven't had that many boyfriends but I can say that I still maintain contact with all of them. I don't see them much, but we can still be friendly.

I recommend having a calm conversation when you're not annoyed with him.  Just explain that you are uncomfortable with the lack of effort he has put into getting ready, that you don't know what you're doing and you would like to figure things out together rather than having to instruct him.  Tell him how it makes you feel using constructive ""when you do X I feel Y"" statements, not accusations.  

It's also ok for you to let him know that you would like it if he put some extra effort into making you feel special.  Things like booking you a massage.  Again, talk about how you're feeling and what you would like from him.  It's a difficult time for us and letting our partners know that we need a little extra TLC is ok.

My husband is generally great about this stuff.  He'd had a child before so I could ask his opinion on anything and get a thoughtful answer, even though he didn't put in nearly as much research as I did.  He is also really good about looking after me.  I try not to send him on craving runs if I don't have to and he tries to stay ahead of what I want to keep me happy.  Even still, I told him last week that he hasn't done any little surprises like flowers for a few months, and I would sure like it if he did.  Good communication sorts out almost all of my grumps, and the ones it doesn't, well my mind returns after a while and I stop being so irrational.

whoremongering,gaybros,1389153209.0,"The response by Wamai et al. (which is now only in my post) is a very thorough rebuttal of your paper by Boyle and Hill. For example:

&gt;While Boyle and Hill offer little new evidence opposing male circumcision for HIV prevention, the evidence in support of the efficacy of male circumcision for HIV prevention since the RCTs’ findings were published has continued to mount. The partially protective effect of male circumcision against HIV acquisition in heterosexual men has been sustained, in fact reaching 67% by 4.5 years in the Kenyan RCT,14 and 73% by 4.8 years in the Ugandan RCT.15 

&gt;it is problematic that Boyle and Hill have published their highly selective literature review, ignoring so much of the wider literature on male circumcision and HIV prevention. In addition, although they refer to the 2009 Cochrane report by noting its statement of the need for localised research to assess “feasibility, desirability, and cost-effectiveness”,44 they fail to state the primary findings of that report.

&gt;By selectively citing several outlier studies that they claim did not find higher HIV in uncircumcised men,49 Boyle and Hill fail to acknowledge the overall support for male circumcision from the systematic reviews and meta-analyses referred to above.

Wamai et al. note 4 ecological studies, 35 cross-sectional studies, 14 prospective studies, 3 RCTs, and hundreds of reviews and meta-analyses that support circumcision for reduction of HIV infection, whereas Boyle and Hill appear to cherrypick only a fraction of those.

Renner1,AskReddit,1389153457.0,"&gt; US conservatives are obsessed with feminism and gay rights.

Maybe an extreme fringe in regard to Evangelical Protestantism are, and by no means not all self-identified Protestants in America.

This group is essentially reacting-- in regard to the ludicrous debauchery of the Gay Pride movement, or from certain groups of feminists basically saying that abortion should be a form of birth control and that it should be free and instantaneously on demand-- which is something that I don't agree with either. But we've been over this before.

The extreme Evangelical Protestants are a lot worse in other ways, I find-- their support for Zionism and Israel, their defacto backing of the neo-con botched war drive, their lies and their callousness about people in the Arab world.

&gt; That's actually the basic idea of feminism

No, that's the ideal of egalitarianism. I do admit that egalitarianism by itself doesn't work for me in all fields, but as I said, as far as the sexes are concerned, that's how I think at least in general.

&gt; entitled to the same rights and responsibilities. 

It's sad for you that many second and third generation feminists in North America and Western Europe don't think like that.

Second generation, which still exists, seems to believe that men or ""male culture"" is evil and dangerous and oppressive, and third generation is obsessed with being able to do whatever they want when they want especially where relationships and sex are concerned, but consistently demonizing men or male sexuality in various ways, as well as trying to have as many privileges as possible in general and none of the responsibility.

At least, that's how the very worst of the third wave feminists I've had the misfortune to come into contact with behave.

&gt; What is it about feminism that you reject?

I find the ""patriarchy"" theory that evolved out of feminist literature to be historically baseless and otherwise nonsensical, for a start.

Also, really most everything in terms of second and third wave theory and terminology and anything relating to so-called ""gender"" feminism.

I take into account that many of the second wave feminist ideologues were grotesque masses of fat and rage who legitimately hated masculinity and men in general, and the third wave feminists, especially the ones who make use of all of the rubbish terminology and sling it around as though it's factual all over the internet and elsewhere are really just extremely juvenile.

&gt; Also, why do you dislike the historical aspect of feminism?

I've said already that my dislike of feminism starts with the second wave and the beginning of the deluge of bullshit immflamatory passive-aggressive feminist literature and historical revisionism.

&gt; Do you disagree with the movement that enabled women to vote

That has nothing to do with second or third wave feminism or ""gender feminism"".

&gt; or gave women the chance to choose education and financial independence, over being expected to stay home all day and rely on a husband for money?

The history of societies across the world before second wave feminism started historical revisionism are far more multifaceted and complex in terms of how said societies operated.  You can't really claim ""before feminism, no women were educated and they all were shut away and not allowed to work"".

&gt; I know some people don't agree with modern feminist ideas, but I don't see how anyone would disagree with the entire ideology.

Well, as I keep saying, I am an egalitarian, at least for the most part.

I don't agree with any of the modern or ""third wave female sex positive"" feminist theory; I see it as being just as bad in its own way as the openly man-despising second wave feminism.

I find both waves engage in a lot of delusional thinking and that their historical theories and ideological soundbites are either very unrealistic or just openly meant to be antagonistic or unhelpful.

Of the striking options, only Giroud and Bendtner can be reasonably expected to contribute. The remaining players combined have played a total of less than 5 games up front for Arsenal.

Podolski can contribute, but it seems that his normal movements and positioning in a game do not mesh well with those expected of a striker in the formation we play. Walcott was a bit like that as well, but his effective ability to be quickest to the ball made him a different sort of threat up front. Even when he played as a right winger, positional maps show that he played increasingly as a second striker. 

I'm not saying we've got shit players, but I'm looking at our options and I'd like to see either Bendtner play a much more increased role in the second half of the season, or see us go into the market for an experienced player with the desired attributes for a lone striker role."

This is apparent throught-out the Socratic dialogues (despite Socrates excoriating the Sophists for doing the same) and there's no reason to believe Plato didn't do the same. Aristotle, of course, made him money the same way, though he had a more famous and successful (?) pupil is Alexander. "

You hit the nail on the head there. For lack of a better term, you're right, but for the wrong reasons.

Your entire argument revolves around the idea that religion has led to human suffering - and that's where you are incorrect. The lack of the existence of a god would dictate that religion itself came from man. And thus, although religion has been a vehicle for human suffering, it is not the cause. The cause is man.

If religion weren't around to use as a tool, man would merely use something else."

keypuncher,conservatives,1389153953.0,"&gt; From all reports, it sounds like Democrats are going to go with the tried and true strategy for winning votes at the national level: class warfare.

Democrats aren't ""going to go with"" class warfare - they've been doing class warfare for a long time now, and are just continuing to do so.

""Income Inequality"" is just the new name for it - but it comes down to this:  If the people on the bottom end have enough to cover basic necessities and the ability to improve their lot by working harder, working smarter, or starting a business - then income inequality does not matter.  Concerns regarding it are an attempt to play on people's greed and their envy of those who are doing better - nothing more.

&gt; BUT, and here’s the kicker, in order for the divide and conquer strategy to work, the political right has to stay true to form and stay home on election day if the perfect candidate(s) don’t survive the primaries:

This is a fairly recent phenomenon - and it isn't about the refusing to vote for any but the ""perfect"" candidates.  It is about refusing to vote for Republican candidates who are functionally indistinguishable from Democrats, those who take anti-constitutional positions on issues (i.e., 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th Amendment rights, for example), push Amnesty for illegals, or for expanding government).  We've spent decades voting for these people because we were told the only possible alternative was a Democrat - and look where it has gotten us as a nation.

Most of us are still willing to compromise on a lot of issues - but there are some where we've compromised for too long and it has to stop.  

The Republican Establishment is all about telling us how it will be doomsday if we don't keep compromising our principles and allowing our rights and freedoms to be eroded, because they are all about pushing for that.  They lost the last two Presidential elections running ""moderate"" candidates - one of whom has since proven himself indistinguishable from a Democrat.

&gt; Republicans such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio...

Barking up the wrong tree here.  Conservatives were originally very supportive of Rubio, until he betrayed them on immigration, and started telling different stories depending on what language he was being interviewed in.  He'll be lucky to retain his seat in 2018.

As to a plan to deal with the ""War on Poverty"", conservatives have one - it involves a variety of policy changes to get businesses to move jobs back to the US, and weaning people off welfare.  The way to move people out of poverty is to put them to work - and in order to put them to work there have to be jobs for them to do.  Companies will move jobs to the US when it is more profitable for them to have US workers than foreign workers.

Of course, all of those things are antithetical to liberal ideals - and to the Republican Establishment too, because making it more profitable for companies to have employees here would mean invalidating the sweetheart deals some large corporations have lobbied for, and putting them on a level playing field with everyone else.

&gt; ...the idea that acquiring skills and hard work is going to be the answer to “lifting themselves out of poverty” is going to be a hard sell when someone else has money the government can just raid and redistribute.

Then the Republican Establishment needs to start running candidates who can win while making that hard sell and helping them to do so - instead of fighting against the ones who can."

psychicsword,AskReddit,1389153970.0,"That is only true if you count Healthcare costs in as a ""tax"" for the purpose of comparison. The problem with doing that is that it ignores all the other problems we have in our system that are increasing the cost of healthcare in this country and assumes that the only difference is how it is being paid for. The average american only pays something like 18% on their income when you add up income taxes at all levels of the government. [The average federal effective tax rate is only 11% for Americans](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/taxes/story/2012-01-19/romney-tax-rate/52682372/1). [Apparently many of the countries with universal healthcare have far worse income tax rates than that](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/10/the-10-countries-with-the-highest-income-tax-rates.aspx#.UszMuZ5dVEg). The biggest problem is that due to very complex set of problems we are currently paying almost 2x as much in healthcare costs than the rest of the world. Part of that may be that there isnt a single negotiating power aiming towards lower prices but that is not the only cause of the problem and it isnt that simple. "

Nothing I learned about breastfeeding was really useful until I had a baby to try it out with, and a nurse to position him and damn near suffocate him in my bosom, then it was ""oh THAT's what a proper latch looks/feels like!""

I also found that the classes tended to have a bias to them intentional or not.  Some instructors make breastfeeding sound like the hardest thing ever (and you'll inevitably need to supplement and finally give up), some make it sound like the easiest thing ever (and only a totally incompetent mother could screw it up and poison her baby with formula!), and there were way more incompetent husband/dad jokes all around than I was comfortable with.

As for science?  Hell, God's existence wouldn't disprove science.  A lot of science at one time was carried out by a bunch of monks, carefully studying nature to better learn how God worked.  There might be a focus on reconciling the differences between what we've seen and what the Bible says - but then again, maybe humans got it wrong when we wrote down the word of God.  Or something.

So in the first column, you have an english word, and a danish word. When you give them any word from the list, you then compare their answer to the other word in that same column. 

So if the 0th column holds This in the first element, and DanishThis in the 2nd element, compare the 2nd place in the 0th row to their entry.

futurecrazycatlady,relationships,1389154726.0,"First of all, please understand that I know your boyfriend could (and should) be doing more, and that this isn't something that I think you are the sole responsible person for. 

And this isn't really in his defense, but I do think that it's important: the trouble with games and especially games like LoL is that they are fun, and immersive, which means that your perception of time changes quite a bit. When you think you've been only playing for 30 minutes it has been 3 hours already. So to him his extra time probably flies by, and doesn't feel like that much more time at all. And the fact that he's having so much fun, probably doesn't help him realize that he could be doing fun things with you and plan dates.

I can understand that you are very tired with being the responsible one, and that it now even feels that the only way for you to get him to do dates is either you nagging him to think of something to do, or do it yourself. But honestly, I think the easiest way to get things done at this moment is just to start.

Pick a day in the week where you are busiest and find cheap places to eat. It will save you from cooking so take a little of the load of for that day, it will be good for the dog to learn that restaurants aren't places you own and need to guard from people entering and use your time there to think of other things that you could do together that will be both fun and relaxing. Perhaps following a series instead of watching movies, or learn to give each other the best foot- or back-rubs.

Renner1,AskReddit,1389154999.0,"&gt; I don't see a problem with someone being ""flamboyantly gay."" Some men are obsessively heterosexual, trying to emulate John Wayne or Chuck Norris, and I don't see anyone complaining.

I see plenty of problems with it. Especially as far as the militant LGBTs go.

I don't see anyone pretending to be like John Wayne, and Chuck Norris is essentially a meme on the internet, most prominently.

But I would have a problem with heterosexuals acting as the ""Gay Pride"" ludicrously flamboyant, ludicrously aggressive LGBTs do.

&gt; And from a legal standpoint, I don't see how anyone can oppose gay marriage, if they believe in the ideas of the constitution. If you live by Biblical commandments, Leviticus, Sharia, or some other religious code, I can see why someone would oppose gay marriage. But if you believe in equality, and separation of church and state, I don't see how someone could oppose gay marriage, at least from a legal standpoint. 

And the LGBT movement as it is now is only giving hard-line fundamentalists more fuel to burn, and alienating a large portion of people in the process of acting like ludicrous living caricatures.

As far as I'm concerned, I don't care if they want a civil union or whatever, as long as they shut up for five minutes about their homosexuality and actually try afterwards to act like regular people. Same thing applies if homosexuals want to adopt a child-- if they're going to raise the child normally and not turn their situation into some ridiculous militant LGBT advocating platform, then I'm more receptive to that idea.

But the fact is that they'd gain a lot more ground by proving consistently that they were just regular people as the rest of accepted society. I know a few gays and lesbians who don't talk about their sexuality to all and sundry-- who don't bring it up at all-- and who focus on living ordinary lives and not acting all militant LGBT, and I have no issue with it. I could care less.

&gt; Personally, I really dislike the MRA ideology

At face value, I see nothing wrong with it. There are some people who consider themselves full MRAs who do take it completely overboard, sometimes to the extent of almost seeming like parallel second wave feminists, but as men-- the whole ""men don't need women"" attitude is uncannily like the second wave bullshit.

But I find that, for the most part, ""MRA"" has become some sort of distorted ad hominem used by the very worst of the internet third wave feminists especially.

&gt; And from my experience, every one of them hates women, things women are inferior, or has some type of resentment towards women, that they make very obvious. 

Sure, that's possible. I'm sure you as a feminist probably have some overly vague boundaries for what constitutes ""hating"" women, but of course there are going to be some people like that who get into the MRA business. They're just not accepted by males in society at large, though.

I could easily say that I've met a number of self-described feminists who hate men. Or at the very least hate ""male culture"" or heterosexuality in men. The school I was talking about earlier was full of third wave feminists with a bit of second wave garbage thrown in as well-- it's nice the student body was so small, and that there were others of both sexes who thought that third wave feminist theory and the attitude of the school are bullshit.

She is receptive and flirts back and you still like her:  ""Cool, after talking and flirting I am still into her.  Time to escalate a little and see if things how things go.""

She is receptive and flirts back, but you don't like her any more: ""Oh well.  She wasn't what I thought.  Glad I didn't waste my time trying to figure that out without talking to her.  Time to friendzone her and move along.""

She isn't receptive and you still like her:  ""Hmm, she doesn't seem that into me, but I'm still interested.  She might just have been taken back or be having a bad day or something.  I'll try again later and see what happens then.  If she's still out, oh well.  I'll find another cute one later.""

She clearly tells you no:  ""Damn, well I'm glad I didn't spend any time on that one.  Hey, that girl over there is cute.  I'm going to flirt with her and see if I like her.""

But it was something along the lines of ""maybe each person in the relationship has doubts that they're suppressing and cohabitating is an easy way to move forward without taking the plunge directly into marriage. In that instance they should listen to their gut and not get married."" Another point was that there were expectations that living together is a trial run and things will be different once vows are exchanged. When things didn't change after the wedding day, harsh realities set in and one or both spouses bailed. 
Either way, there are so many factors that go into why the data looks the way it does.

The issue is that there are a few common motifs in fairy tales (so much so that there exists a [classification system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarne%E2%80%93Thompson_classification_system) for fairy tale plots). It just so happens that a common motif is the ""Persecuted Heroine"" (princess faces some sort of life struggle, but with the help of some external force—supernatural or not—manages to overcome and live happily ever after) which is motif 510. Furthermore, motif types 850-879 deal strictly with someone (mostly commoners, in my understanding of the motifs) marrying a prince or princess.

My point is that there are many sources of fairy tales that rely on or have references to monarchies. They're popular, therefore they sell. The only agenda behind these movies is to make money, not demand the creation of a monarchy in places where one does not already exist.

Renner1,AskReddit,1389155910.0,"&gt;  A few weeks ago, some news website, I don't remember which, made a list of the 65 most important photos of 2013. 

Probably buzzfeed or something like that. 

&gt; One was a photo of gay activists and Russian Neo-Nazis fighting in the street.

It's interesting because the people who have a hard-on for the militant LGBT movement in Russia don't give a shit about Russian neo-nazis wanting to exterminate everyone who isn't ethnically Russian, but they fight some genderqueers or whatever, and then oh no what an atrocity.

&gt; Some gay rights activists are very good about fighting for the rights of gay people worldwide, especially in countries where homosexuality is punishable by death

Sure, but I said that they wouldn't give two shits if everyone else in those countries other then the gays were being killed en masse.

&gt; But what they are doing to Chechnya and Dagestan is also wrong. Unfortunately, that issue gets almost 0 attention in the media. It's only mentioned when there's a suicide bombing in Russia, and paints Chechnya and Dagestan in a bad light. 

The situation, and misreporting on it, blatantly or otherwise, is far more important the Russia outlawing gay propaganda or aggressive queerism or whatever it is.

The fact is that there's a lot of people who don't realize how badly Russia ravaged Chechnya during both wars, and don't realize that the people who carry out suicide attacks in Russia are either Salafi Jihadis that are almost universally despised in Chechnya and Dagestan both, or otherwise people who lost absolutely everything at the hands of the stupidly brutal Russian forces in the wars.

But I think the conflation of the clearly Salafi Jihadi operatives-- numbering at most 20,000-- with millions of Chechens and Dagestanis who despise Salafi Jihadism is the worst and stupidest part."

The idea that women can rape men from a legal standpoint is a relatively new one, and came about *after* the idea that a wife could be raped by her husband.

The good one was Oakland in 2010, where he took a struggling offense and doubled the total points scored compared to the previous season, which led to an 8-8 record, the best finish for the team since 2002 when Rich Gannon and Jerry Rice were still playing. At the end of the season, the owners chose not to renew HC Tom Cable's contract, eventually promoting Jackson to the job. In 2011 they went 8-8 again, and when Reggie McKenzie was named GM, he immediately fired Jackson, preferring to select his own coach.

He was also briefly OC for the Redskins in 2003 for Steve Spurrier, but I can't find much info on that with quick research.

I suppose there isn't proof that he would for sure be a great OC; I should have stated that he has great *potential* to be one. Aside from his success with the Raiders offense, he also led RB Stephen Jackson to a record season in Washington, kickstarted Cincy's Johnson/Houshmanzebra era, and was Flacco's QB coach for his first two years in the league. Prior to NFL gigs, he also served as OC at Cal for a year and OC at USC for four years. I think he hasn't had much of a chance to prove himself as OC in the NFL, but he certainly has promise.

At least, that's my sleepy analysis."

keypuncher,conservatives,1389156745.0,"This author gets a couple of things right: We need jobs, and the reason there are not as many as there should be is because businesses have been moving them to places where it is cheaper for them to operate.

Then he goes off the rails, both identifying a cause and an incorrect root cause, and proposing nonsense ""solutions"" based on incorrect statements of the problem:

&gt; Well there are many things that probably happened, but the most devastating was good, old-fashioned, capitalist greed.  The greedy business owners  figured out that it is actually cheaper to manufacture goods thousands of miles away and ship them to this country than it is to make them here.  By shipping jobs overseas they were able to make a few extra dollars for themselves and screw the working American.

""Greedy Business owners"" did not do this - the vast majority of businesses that moved their jobs overseas are publicly held companies - which means there are no ""greedy business owners"" - just stockholders.  CEOs of publicly held corporations may be motivated by greed and their bonuses may be based on corporate profits - but that is how it should be, because their jobs are to maximize shareholder profits.  Well, what about the shareholders?  Surely they are greedy rich old white men, right?  Not so much.  Much of the stock in these corporations is held by large investors like colleges, municipalities, and the mutual funds which are largely retirement savings - in short, by most Americans.

&gt; First, if it is bad for Americans to send jobs to China because there are fewer jobs in American, then I’d argue that it is bad for Pennsylvanians to send jobs to New Jersey, New York, Delaware, or any other state.

This is incorrect because workers are mobile within the US and can easily move to other local employment markets within it.  US workers commonly relocate from one state to another to take advantage of better employment markets.  US workers cannot easily relocate to China to take advantage of Chinese employment markets, and could not do so while maintaining the same quality of life or civil rights.

DrPepperHelp,E_Cigarette,1389157421.0,"There are several types of electronic personal vaporizers. The types of PVs are:

##1. The Cig-A-Like.

Shitty gas station rechargeable or throwaway types.

##2. The eGo.

These are what most people quit smokes with. They are about 1/2 inch wide and about 2 inches to 4.5 inches long. The mAh or battery life of these is anywhere from 650 mAh to 1100 mAh. Just as, if not more so, convenient than carrying a pack of smokes and a lighter.

##3. The regulated mods.

These are much larger than the previous category. They can be boxes or tubes. With increased size comes increased power. You can double to quadruple your avalable mAh. That is you can get anywhere from 1600 mAh to 3400 mAh. That depends on the kind of battery you buy though. Mods in this group also usually need a support team. That is batteries, a charger, non-conductive cases for the batteries, and in some cases extra battery caps. This groups also includes the DNA-20 based mods. Most of these are limited maxing out at 20 watts or 6 amps. What ever the device hits first. 

##4. The Mechanical Mod.

These seem to be what you are talking about in your post. These are more for the hobbyist. You can use them if you want with out extensive rebuildable knowledge. For the most part the batteries are the same. However with out any regulation the batteries become more dangerous. You need to know what your amp limits are on all the batteries you own. You also need a quality charger for you batteries. You also might want a Kick to use things like standard starter tanks and drippers. This is also where you get into sub-ohm rebuildables. However that is another topic for another time. NOT recommended for beginners.

##5. OKR-T10 or Similar Mods.

This is a whole new ball game. These are hard to get as there are no mass production mods out there yet. These are also by and far absolutely not meant for anyone who does not have an understanding of ohms law or battery safety.

If you need any help just ask."

greenl1ght,AdviceAnimals,1389157966.0,"&gt; Q:How is it that the propaganda workers are paid so highly?

Because intellectual property is created once and then replicated a million times for free, meaning an affordable per-consumption price still results in a massive cost margin. Because entertainment personalities are a monopoly of one - they're not interchangeable (like, say, sanitation workers. people would revolt quicker if their toilets all quit flushing than if Seinfeld went off the air, but that doesn't mean sanitation workers get paid millions), and combined with the cost margin, they can demand high wages."

cptn_garlock,EngineeringStudents,1389158335.0,"&gt;I crushed tests and my peers respected me.

Oh god, now I'm imagining this big buff dude with a horned viking hat and a big braided beard, abruptly standing up in a testing hall and startling everyone, walking down the aisle with a big scowl on his face, and then turning in their test to a cowering test supervisor while staring them in the eye. You give everyone in the hall an arrogant look and a slight smirk, then leave amidst a flurry of admiring whispers and soaked panties.

Ahem.

&gt;Made a couple friends in my engr classes to study with though. Overall, not as good as I would have liked but doing well enough.

This sounds similar to CC experience - people I can talk to in class and study with outside of it, but not really good friends. Still, I suppose it's better than nothing.

&gt;I live off campus w/ roommates. They are not undergrads but it works out well.

Is this mandatory for transfers? Or are dorms an option?

&gt;I ended up getting 103% on my test in chemE course, so the professor basically gave me a research position that will let me work in the next semester and essentially until I'm done w/ the school. (even allowing me to work 40 hrs/week this summer). Sooo, it kind've fell in my lap to be honest.

First of all, congratulations on the great score, I've heard ChE courses are a bitch even among Eng. tracks. Second, you're right, that does sound rather atypical; I can certainly see a professor recognizing a talented and hardworking student just from a class, but I always figured it's not quite so simple. Do you happen to know what it normally works in your university?

Thank you so much for the detailed information!"
PokesHoleInCondoms,China,1389158341.0,"Here's the only guy in the thread (/u/timaz) who actually understands what's going on here. I had a post earlier on this exact subject a while back:

""I know the fashionable thing is to blame men for all things wrong with the world, but from my personal experience, women are creating these problems for themselves.
Just for context, I'm finishing up graduate school at one of the top research universities in the world (humble brag) and I'm constantly in contact with other Masters students and PhD candidates. Most of them are international students hailing from China. To say the females have insanely unreasonable standards might be understating it.

Of course there are exceptions, but generally speaking, these characteristics are true. They'll basically refuse any potential suitor who is not at the same level of education as them. I'm friends with several MBA's including this one terrific guy who asked an Accounting PhD out and was promptly turned down on account of him ""only"" being a Masters student. Otherwise, by her own admission, they were relatively compatible, but her own misguided pride wouldn't let her date someone ""below her."" It's mind boggling to hear these female PhD's complain about not being able to find a BF or husband in college while they're turning down highly educated men left and right due to them not being in the right major or not having enough earning potential for their liking.
Honestly, I think women are spoiled by their environments. These girls haven't gotten the memo that an elite university's environment is probably the most favorable one they will ever have when it comes to finding single men who are compatible from an education, age, and career perspective. They always think they'll find better for some reason.""

I'll bet you a hefty sum that unless she's a complete recluse, she probably gets asked out regularly but has found reasons, reasonable or unreasonable, to turn them all down."

Like Americorps, or volunteering in Haiti, or something like that.

Working on a Tall Ship is something you have to actually be interested in.  These beautiful ships need dedication from the people who are working aboard.  It's hard work, can be dangerous, and you need to be able to dedicated to learning the ropes(literally) and able to take direction well.  Not to mention be able to maintain a professional image.

If this sounds like something you'd enjoy and do well with, then in the LA area:

* LA Maritime Institute runs two ships, *Irving Johnson* and *Exy Johnson* in San Pedro.
* Ocean Institute runs *Spirit of Dana Point* and *Pilgrim* in Dana Point, but I'm not sure if they have liveaboard crew.
* There's also *American Pride* and *Tole Mour* in Long Beach.  The latter is a rather difficult one to get aboard.  I have no idea how the former manages its crew.

First off, do some research.  There are plenty of articles online that talk about what it's like being aboard a Tall Ship.  Then, if you're still interested, contact an organization and explain you're interested in being a liveaboard volunteer.

That's as far as I can take you."

Renner1,AskReddit,1389158664.0,"&gt; You are lucky to have never met one of these people. I've met a few people, mostly rednecks, with these types of attitudes. 

There you have it-- rednecks. People who wouldn't be considered ""the norm"" in regular society, especially urban society.

&gt; There are a lot of gay people. The vast majority are not ""acting like caricatures"". 

The ones in the Gay Pride movement and the  more aggressive LGBT movements in general do act like caricatures. At least the very open, very loud ones do.

&gt; Though I have to wonder, how would you determine which ideology someone teaches their children? Having gay parents will not make you gay. 

The point was that if two gay men are raising a child, they shouldn't turn it into some big LGBT activist thing. They should just raise the child as any heterosexual parents that are half-decent would.

Don't turn it into some massive thing and don't constantly talk about LGBT shit to the child, is what I'm saying.

&gt; The people you are describing probably represent 95% of gay people. 

95% of gays don't wear their sexuality perpetually on their sleeve and don't base their lives and identity around it in a prominent fashion?

That's news to me.

&gt; I don't mind someone saying ""men don't need women"", because it's true. Women don't need men either.

I disagree on both accounts. I think it's necessary for the sexes to interact in specific ways with one another. 

Objectively speaking, the sexes don't ""need"" one another, but I think this way of thinking is unhealthy either way.

&gt; Most MRAs are very angry towards women.

And there are many of the very worst sorts of second and third wave feminists that seem to be very angry towards men. Most often because of very loose or unprovable ideological concepts, or because they just don't like men in general-- this is second wave, for the most part.

There are some MRAs that do dislike women, but there are some who make some valid points.

&gt;  Most men I know hate MRAs.

Are they ""allies""? Are they the sort of men who go on about ""patriarchy"" and chant inane slogans about ""if you're not a feminist, you're a bigot""?

Because MRA, all things considered, is still pretty fringe. I only know about them because I read a few things on the internet and you hear feminists going on about how evil and ""misogynistic"" they are.

&gt; They can't understand why they are so resentful.

I can understand why one would get resentful of all the rubbish spouted by especially the third wave feminists. It's better not to, though-- I don't think they should be, or really are taken too seriously when it comes down to it, although some idiots will try and make their terminology mainstream. 

&gt; I think a lot of men who are somehow hurt by women turn to the MRA movement, and eventually turn into woman haters. 

I think it really depends what sort of ""MRA"" thinking they have. Most don't seem to spout an equivalence of some of the bullshit that comes from some feminists."

timsstuff,AskMen,1389158870.0,"43m, currently divorced, got married at 25 after 2 years together, was single again at 38. When I was your age I had the pleasure of sleeping with a very sexy redhead who was 48 and she rocked my world. Definitely turned me on to older women. A couple years later I married a woman 12 years older than me. It didn't work out but it wasn't due to age so much as personality. I have a friend from high school who is still married and madly in love with a woman 15 years older than him. Since the divorce I've dated girls from 29 to 50. Older women tend to be much more laid back and open with their sexuality, although I hear the younger ones are more accustomed to the porn fantasies and more willing to do dirtier stuff but I can't speak for the early 20's crowd since I haven't been with one of those since the 90s.

But now I find myself attracted to and dating women about 10 years younger than me. 33 seems to be my ideal age. It changes as you get older. When you're younger, older is better but that only lasts so long. Girls my age are hit and miss - if you meet 40 something chicks in bars they can be pretty washed up and ragged but there are definitely some good ones, you just have to find them.

&gt; You're making a distinction without a difference. There doesn't have to be a single business owner, there can be several, and they can be a large collection of stockholders.

But it is not a distinction without a difference.  ""Greedy business owners"" is meant to evoke an image of rich old white men sitting behind a desk lighting their cigars with $100 bills made from the tears of the poor.

The reality of it is that the people who own those businesses are a majority of average Americans.

&gt; That part was mostly about comparative advantage.

...which is why it was problematic - it used that argument as if it were self-contained, without examining *why* it was cheaper to ship jobs overseas: the US tax and regulatory environment.  The fact that it is more expensive is treated by the author as a fundamental law without ever examining why it is the case or whether it can be changed.

Daiteach,community,1389159032.0,"He'd been a successful lawyer for a while before being forced to re-enroll. He's not insensible and wasn't supporting a family or dealing with any major crises, so presumably he had some savings. Additionally, things like his wardrobe and his vehicle were presumably acquired at least in part while he was still a lawyer. It's not impossible that he was accumulating some amount of debt, since he was in school. Given that he ended up close to broke by the start of season five, it's possible that he had budgeted his savings enough to get through school and to get himself started up again as a lawyer, figuring that from there he'd be good enough.

And yeah, as Goredema points out, characters on television generally have however much money they need to support what's going on."

You aren't going to make amends. You aren't going to make him feel better for the way you treated him. There are no magic words that will take away all of the hurt you caused him. You want to apologize because you want to make *you* feel better. You're looking for closure on it, and you want to try to save face. You aren't apologizing for his benefit, or to make him feel better. 

&gt;I treated him like shit and called him terrible things for putting up with me. I lied to him. I stole from him. I cheated on him. I threatened to tell the cops he was an abuser and a kiddie-fucker. I got him fired. I hit him and kicked him out three months after we signed a lease together, and then I manipulated him into buying me plane tickets to visit my family, changed the locks so he couldn't get in, and kept on stealing from him until he changed his passwords. He tried to kill himself. Today, I'm glad he failed, but I was such a bitch back then that I laughed at his parents when they called me to let me know.

There is nothing you could ever say or do that would make him think of you in a different light after all of this. He has made it very clear he does not want you in his life at all, even if it's for a split moment to apologize. He doesn't want your apology. And if not apologizing to him makes you ""so goddamn mad at him that I want to punch out all of his stupid fucking teeth and find out where he works so I can get him fired from there too"", then you seriously need help. He doesn't need 'amends', you need a therapist."

Perspective133,worldnews,1389159192.0,"I believe you are underestimating human potential. Leaders who effectively goad the masses in to committing atrocities have several traits in common: they are all extremely cunning, very charismatic, and very creative about their approach. They wouldn't ""need"" religion to do what they do; they're smart enough to do the same without it.

Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot didn't need religion to get people to accept the horrors of their time. Neither did Hitler, or Hirohito, nor Genghis Khan, nor Robespierre... the list goes on.

I believe you're also overlooking the various under-reported contributions to the world which have spawned from religious faith. There are quite a few religious organizations which are directly responsible for charity work in many third-world and starving nations. I'd also encourage you to analyze the contributions to science from those of religious faiths; [here's a link to a large list of Christians who have made major contributions to science, and have helped to discover the world as we know it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_thinkers_in_science). And that's just from *one* set of religious beliefs.

Another factor that I do not believe you are analyzing is that religion has helped to establish basic sets of cultural law and order for entire civilizations which I would argue were, in ancient times, very necessary for the continued survival and flourishing of humanity.

It's my belief that comparing the benevolent and malevolent influence which religion has had is quite simply outside of the scope of a reddit debate; there's simply too much which is both good and bad which has spawned due to religion to give an accurate comparison. We could continue giving examples and counter examples to one another, but in the end there's simply so much which has happened over the course of human history which has been inspired by religion that our respective lists would be veritably endless.

However, it is my belief that human beings tend to typically focus on the negative aspects of almost anything over the positive. This is why you'll always hear news about some batshit insane group of Christians oppressing someone somewhere, however, you will rarely hear news about a religious organization donating massive amounts of money and manpower to help feed destitute denizens of third-world nations.

In the end, religion in and of itself isn't good nor bad; like anything else, it depends on what people do with it."

Fortunately lots of companies will give you a discount on a replacement helmet if you bought your last one through them (Tipperary, Charles Owens, GPA, IRH, and a few others do this), so it's not too expensive to replace the helmet every time you fall.

My point is, smoking is demonstrably an exponentially greater public health risk, and yet I don't see smokers told that they are bad human beings and that they deserve to be thrown in jail for abusing their kids by smoking around them. And a lot of smokers do. I find that horrifying. But where's the outcry?

The risks of smoking around your children are greater than the risks of not vaccinating them. Unvaccinated kids might get sick; but kids who grow up inhaling secondhand smoke *will* suffer for it. Yet it is the parents who don't vaccinate who are crucified for it and are treated like they're scum.

stephengee,knifeclub,1389160595.0,"Just to add to shifty's technique, you can actually feel when you are hitting the edge by feeling for the burr on the backside of the blade. 

For example, you are honing the top, slide your finger on the bottom of the knife, from the spine and let it slide off the edge. You can feel a little catch, this is the burr. If you do this for the length of the blade, you can feel all the way down the edge and find any spots you may not have hit that apex yet. Only when you have a good burr on the entire length I switch to the other side. Do the exact same here, building that burr on the whole blade. 

Then I do two final passes on each side to knock that burr down before going to the next stone. I repeat this all the way through the stones, usually each stone takes a tad longer than the one before, but softer steels this is less noticeable. I find this easier than dealing with the sharpie method as you don't have to bother with wiping oil away and marking over and over.

But there's something a little less museum-y that I think is really cool.  During the 1948 War of Independence, one of the major battlegrounds was the road to Jerusalem.  The Jews in the city were essentially besieged for much of the war, and a tremendous amount of Israeli manpower was spent trying to resupply them, including battles to secure roads, convoys through hostile territory, and building new roads.

Anyway, when the war was over and actual road infastructure built, rusted out trucks from the war were left in the median of the highway to Jerusalem.  It's not really a museum, but a really interesting way of presenting artifacts from the not-so-distant past."

Hmm, I'm surprised, obviously this is an incredibly small sample size but I was expecting more people would be taking advantage of admissions agreements. This makes me feel a lot better, as I can't take advantage of admissions agreements due to a SNAFU over multivar which led me to have a C in the class (the admissions agreements for the two schools I'm most interested in require B's in all math, science and engineering courses.) 

&gt;In CC I had no homework, quizzes, or labs only exams. The courses weren't more or less challenging they just involved a heavier work load so I had to learn time management skills quick in order to survive.

This is something I'm afraid I won't be able to handle. I have a 3.45 in community college which is pretty good compared to my peers but I wonder how well I'll do in University, as I dont have much homework (weekly problemsets from statics, physics and intro to engineering as well as some short lab reports for physics).

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1389161817.0,"I think the trick with alchemy is to really focus on the doctrine of transmutation. While alchemy had very specific and scientific researches into causing transmutation, the whole goal was to turn a base metal into gold, and thus discover the secrets of the universe's structure. The magic system in my story involves a form of alchemy, which I basically ignore the rules of, but I have written quite a bit about transmutation.

The way alchemy and chemistry would differ in a world with some concept of science is that alchemy seeks to produce *more* than the sum of its parts. In low fantasy this matters because if your world has hit the Early Modern era then it *will* have a notion of scientific method *wholly distinct* from the method alchemists used - while experimentation and replication of results remained the same, the alchemists *began with principles* and sought to produce outcomes, while the empirical method of the modern day is to *begin with experiments* and derive the first principles from them.

My current focus, the Imarain, are nomads and animists. Each object has a spirit, which is part of a greater spirit, a distinct and embodied deity. Alchemy is an art which must change the low spirit, but cannot disrespect the high spirit. The best alchemy exalts the spirits of the objects involved - it amplifies their best qualities and lessens their worst, while making concessions for the reagents and catalysts, which will cause change but usually exact some price. Some work which requires no active magic is alchemical in nature, according to the Imarain, like making steel - steel is not like pig-iron nor like coke, and so its spirit is not an admixture of the two, but something wholly else. Sex is also alchemical, because the child is certainly the product of its parents but its spirit is its own. High alchemy, the sort that includes active magic, is used rather frequently, as calling a spirit into action requires conduits for its spirit. If you call a spirit of fire to help you in combat they will burn your enemy. But if the town blacksmith was a drunk, you wouldn't want to burn him - and the spirits would be affronted by the needless violence. But you could call the fire spirits to burn his tongue where liquor touches it, and doing so would require talismans and ritual to communicate your desire to the spirits and guide them in the real world, where they are unaccustomed."

Yahbo,humor,1389162085.0,"&gt;Well due to her attempt to make the worst person imaginable she isn't really jumping to conclusions.

she is though, her attempt at creating a ""horrible person"" is laughable. In order for it to work it would have to be a believable person. This profile is a blatant characterization and is most likely being taken as a sarcastic portrayal of a ""bad person"". And the only way to make a character seem realistic enough to be believable is to actually have people that bad. So if her fake profile were realistic enough to be taken seriously then there is the chance that this handful of men who contacted her are equally as bad as the character she's playing.

Maybe I'm missing something but I don't see why this girl would have to enjoy the sex act in order for it to take place. Sure maybe she's part of that percentage of girls who can get off on 3 to 5 minutes of penetration but the chances are not very good. But basically any guy can get off in that amount of time if they want to and if they find the situation exciting enough. I mean just because she's looking for sex doesn't mean that she'll enjoy any form of sex no matter how brief and one sided it is.

hardcorelegend43,AdviceAnimals,1389162506.0,"Forgive OP. Of course the approximate 5 million other deaths are just as tragic, but typically when the discussion of the Holocaust is brought up, ideas of anti-semitism rise to the surface first, as Jews were the largest group of victims. Not to mention the withstanding anti-semitic laws that existed in Germany in the 1930's/40s and late 19th century under the second German Reich, not forgetting the anti-semitism within Germany dating back to the time of Martin Luther in the 16th century. The Holocaust is viewed as a culmination of intense hatred of Jews within Europe for centuries, where as that hatred for the other categories of victims of the Holocaust was not nearly as long lasting or severe.. All the gays, communists, germans, poles, slavs, russians, and other ""categories"" of those systematically murdered by the nazi regime, were just as unfairly treated.

That's hilarious. I especially like how there were two other girls and they both wrote equally stupid things to the cyrus after her ridiculous performance. Also side splitting was the usual tumblr morons claiming that Cyrus ""stole"" twerking from Africans because some trash that live in a ghetto consider it to be a dance move.

Beyoncé's irrelevant but better looking the Rihanna.

&gt; In their defense, the laws being passed deal mostly with gay people.

But the no gay pride parades law doesn't have anything to do with the neo-nazis. They do a hell of a lot of things in Russia that are far worse and hardly get media attention in comparison to the anti gay propaganda laws.

&gt; One example is the War On Christmas. Christians are killed in some countries, just for being Christian. American Christians don't do much about that, they are more concerned with a cashier saying ""Happy Holidays""

This is primarily a more obviously conservative Christian thing, or at least in the domain of the Christians in the GOP, as far as I understand it. 

True, but they do care about Christians being attacked if it helps them spread lying propaganda-- ie, it's not Al Qaeda attacking Christians in Iraq, but just Sunnis, because ""Sunni"" by default means ""Al Qaeda"" or ""Al Nusra"" or anything Salafi Jihadist to conservative or very conservative Christians in the states. 

So it's almost like they care, but at the same time they don't, because they have no idea of what's actually going on or who's actually attacking Christians, and whose only solution is to kill as many or more people who hate the sectarians or extremists then extremists themselves. Oftentimes they won't care, and didn't care, when Christians are killed through US action.

 &gt; The media is always happy to jump on a terrorism story. It's the only way the government can continue to spend trillions every year on ""defense"". 

That's true. You'd think they'd actually be interested in achieving their goals in Afghanistan and fixing Iraq as they played a major role in breaking it, but no. Seems like the fixation is with creating as much money as possible, and allowing the military industrial complex to profit openly from quagmire situations or screw-ups.

All sorts of blundering and stupidity in both campaigns. I'm not a big pro-war guy, but anyone from Syria through Iraq through Dagestan and a number of other places know just how bad news the takfiri and the violent Salafi Jihadi are-- they don't have a whole lot in terms of numbers, but they make up for it through their brutality.

To that extent, I support the engagement in Afghanistan in the sense that they were supposed to remove the Taliban and the other takfirist elements; although to be honest they should never have stopped paying attention to Afghanistan after the Soviets left and the country was well and truly in ruins. They could've also directly supported the Northern Alliance and their anti-Taliban allies back in the 1990's, or at the very, very least, coordinated with Ahmad Massoud and his people, considering that Massoud went to the UN two months before 9/11 and said ""Al Qaeda is in Afghanistan and they're planning to attack America"".

I'm not pro-Iraq war, but since they went ahead and did it anyways, they ought to have stuck around until the country is fully stabilized. Iraqi Army isn't at all terrible but, like I said above, you break something like a country, or stand by and allow extremists to filter in and start doing terrible things, then it behoves you to stick it out and make sure things resolve themselves properly.

&gt; But that doesn't fit the story the media wants to portray. They want to portray Chechnya as a country where everyone is a terrorist and a criminal, and beheadings and suicide bombings are a daily occurrence. 

This, or it's just sheer laziness on part of the media and then the usual idiots and pundits jump in with their garbage and nonsensical ""talking points""."

At the low side of the cycle, the coolant is colder than the air in the refrigerator, and at the high side, the coolant is warmer than the air in the room.
  
This is accomplished with a pressure difference.  If you pressurize a cold gas, you can raise its temperature without adding any heat.  When you depressurize it, the temperature goes back down. A refrigeration cycle works by pressurizing a gas to raise its temperature, and cooling it with the room in the air.  The gas is then depressurized, which drops its temperature to below the temperature inside the refrigerator.  Once the cold gas soaks up enough heat from the refrigerator, it gets repressurized and the cycle continues.  The net result is using coordinated energy, or work, to move heat against a temperature gradient."

Well, I live in lefty-friendly Vancouver.

Well, honestly, Whole Foods is crazy expensive and packed, so maybe there is a market. However, is it financially sustainable or just a trend?

There's also spud.ca, which will deliver local organic produce and products. They appear to be doing well, although their products are significantly more expensive. I assume this is more environmentally friendly than going to a grocery store.

Toeclippers,AskReddit,1389164434.0,Ok. A little story behind this. It was prom senior year and I was at an after party with a bunch of friends. And the person who was hosting the party was a huge Twilight fan. So much so that she had her own life size cardboard cut out of Edward Cullen just chilling in the living room staring at all of us. Eventually we all get tired and either start leaving or stay the night at her place. I decided to stay and sleep on the couch. I fall asleep with no problems. Since it was a couch I was bound to wake up at some point and change positions. The living room is dimly lit from the street lights but when I slowly wake up I see a silhouette standing RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I promptly flip my shit and freak the fuck out only to realize that it was that damn cardboard cut out of Edward Cullen. Somebody decided to move it right next to me for me to find it when I wake up. Scariest wake up. Ever.

But then I realized the internet is not the real world, and that many of the opinions and the preoccupation with heightism seen here are not actually representative of anyone in this sub.

You say that you're over your height, but you don't seem to be able to deal with other people trying to arrive at your claimed state of enlightenment in regards to how your stature affects your social interactions and your own self-esteem. If you don't like what's happening here, then leave, but attacking people for saying things that clearly make you feel uncomfortable is just nonconstructive.

Here's some answers to unanswered questions.

* Rifles and muskets

Rifles are reskinned crossbows.

Muskets are reskinned hand crossbows.

Forget realism. Make them reload in the same round as they attack. Otherwise things get tedious.

* Silver and ""obsidian""

Love it. Do it. But make it a different metal - silver is too easy to find, or is not powerful. An average person with some magical ability can be stopped with silver. A wizard in training can be stopped with lots of silver. A fully trained wizard can only be stopped by a full body covered in silver, or metal X. A powerful wizard cannot be stopped with silver, but can with extensive metal X. An epic wizard (epic level) can only be stopped with a full metal X covering.

Make metal X something nonexistant in the real world, or something very rare, like osmium. Sample names: Nonarcanium, Silurium, Wizardsbane

Obsidian stuff works. Maybe it is another metal, and gems containing this metal are used in magic staves. These, using complex, costly and difficult arcane rituals, can be purified. Sample names: Gems (make these vary greatly with varied strength and rarity): Wizard's (insert gemstone), Dondarrion, Helurium, Pelorium Purified metal: Arcanium, Raxicoricum, Blacksilver

(I've hidden 1 SOIAF reference and 2 doctor who references in the names)

* BIG DOLLAS

Two options.

Option one: What you said. Money gets big in epic level, but not from quests - rather, from holdings (partnership in a company, taxes from your barony, etc.). Magic items are notoriously hard to sell past level 10. It would be more fruitful to put them in a museum or collection.

Option two: Make things require upkeep. Sure, you got 200gp from that quest, but what about the cost of food, resources, weapon and armour upkeep, ritual components, inns, ale, taxes?

* Races

Dwarves and elves hate each other. Classic.

""Civilised"" races are mildly xenophobic, but accepting. They'll live with you, but they won't invite you to dinner.

""Outlandish"" races are also accepted by non-humans, as they haven't been treated the same way. Elves and dwarves have lived with tieflings and dragonborn forever.

""Uncivilized"" races are typically accepted if they choose to live together, but almost always are hated because they're, well, uncivilized. Orcs are raiders and warmongers, goblins are thieves and cutthroats, ogres are man-eating savages. This garners an obvious response. Half-uncivilized races are accepted in large settlements, and small settlements if they have been seen enough. If a half-orc grew up in the tiny village of Northdale, your half-orc will be welcome. If he was a ne'er-do-well, you're welcome but not trusted. If they've never seen you before, you're as good as an orc.

All of these groups of races share kinship because of their standing. Uncivilized races band together, but are still uncivilized, and may take slaves from each other or pillage each other's camps.

* Drugs

Dwarven ale is banned in non-dwarven settlements. This is because it is very, VERY strong. One gulp of dwarven ale equates a night of drinking in a non-dwarf. Dwarves can drink it normally, and it is worth noting they drink copiously and have a ridiculous tolerance. Dwarven spirits are used as poisons, and simply cannot be consumed safely unless greatly diluted. Because it costs less to make diluted dwarven spirits/ale than it does to make regular spirits/ale, these are commonly sold by lowlifes. These lowlifes, however, are prone to doing it wrong...

Wizards are known or smoking various herbs. They are drugs, and act like, pot, coke, etc. (depends on the herb) but enhance arcane ability. If you re caught with these, lawmen will let you go peacefully if you can show that you have actual arcane power. While using these, non- magic users can use cantrips for a short period of time. No use of these drugs can imitate actual learning. Even a level 30 fighter who uses copious ammounts of mageleaf cannot use level 1 spells.

Goblingrass is a powerful hallucinogen. It is used by goblin tribes for religious reasons.

Orcswood is a chewed twig or branch, and acts to calm oneself. Orcs are permitted to have this, as it lowers their anger and makes them normal members of society. Orcs, in their own tribes, use it for tactical planning and reason. Although not used by fighters, orc leaders use this drug often, as natural orc anger clouds judgement and reason.

Halfwhiskey: This liquid is consumed in remote halfling colonies. It has the effect of pot and causes mild hallucinations. Halflings are unaffected by this and drink it for its exquisite taste.

Elven ale/spirits: Elves brew ales and spirits with no alcohol content, but highly regarded taste. This is legal, and quite expensive.

Dragonroot: This root causes jitters and acts as a powerful upper. Dependency is a very high risk. When taken by dragonborn, however, it has the opposite effect, retaining dependency risk. This is illegal in both dragonborn settlements and other settlements."

These are all stylized and invented. Always change. A human name would be something like Tym. An elven name would be something like Armandil. A dwarven name would be something like Ruska. An orc could be called Grok. A goblin could be called Khagonim the Cutter. Keeping up with medieval fantasy, stay in Europe or America. I only have layman's knowledge of linguistics, so correct me where I'm wrong. Other linguistic groups can be used for less common or homebrew races.

Humans have germanic/celtic/semitic names.

Halfings have celtic names.

Elves have highly stylized romantic names or chinese/japanese/korean names.

Dwarves have Eastern European names.

Dragonborn have harsh, dragonny names.

Orcs have very harsh sounding names, basically a series of syllables, often very few. Imagine First Nations names in structure, but very harsh in pronunciation.

Goblins have First Nations or Southeast Asian names, and almost always titles.

Tieflings have noble-sounding harsh human names, or names like ""fear"", ""melancholy"" or ""pain"".

Drow have similar names too elves, but whereas elves have a certain beauty to their names, drow have a certain ugliness to theirs. Drow names are also often very long, and thus they use short forms.

Many monster races have very simple names or none at all."

Someone like that experiences criticism on their actions as a dismissal of their being. They were never taught that if someone disagrees with an action, it doesn't mean someone disapproves of their entire person.

Imagine if someone said to you: ""I don't like the colour of your dress."" 

What happens in your head next: ""The colour of your dress is awful, you can't do anything right, this is one more mistake in a line of mistakes, why do I put up with you, you always do everything wrong, I might as well dump you, you useless piece of shit.""

What comes out of your mouth next: ""It's my goddamn dress! If you don't like how I dress, then why don't you just break up with me!?""

I imagine that's sort of what happens. You don't see that imaginary gunning down that happens in their head, so to you the reaction is totally blown out of proportions.

If they were never taught how to handle criticism, it's not difficult to teach them. And if they're a wonderful person, and willing to learn, there's no need to break up over this. But they need to be willing to learn.

The only thing I could do with consistency was feel sorry for myself and wish I knew someone well enough to express that to them, and that got me nowhere. I'm no social expert, but I've been in highly social jobs (customer serve, sales with no leads) and I know I can be excellent at it when I am in full swing. It seems like full swing has an anterior, though, and this technique brought me out of it. I realized that being lonely was my own fault - because nobody is going to include you just because ""you're great"" so you better get out that and include yourself. It's not always what you are doing that is wrong, but sometimes what you are not doing. A bench is the perfect first step.

The ISP determines your connection speed (10-1000 Mbit) and quality, extra services (HikariTV, VoIP service, etc). So your monthly bill will be part to NTT for the fiber, and part to the ISP for the actual service. When you apply, you apply to your preferred ISP, and they'll direct NTT to hook up the fiber for you, so you don't have to deal with coordinating two companies.

Popular ISPs include Yahoo!, OCN, Asahi-Net and Plala (plala is owned by NTT themselves). [Even AKB48 run an ISP nowadays](http://www.akb48.ne.jp).

betnhe,AskReddit,1389168365.0,"You can follow these steps (together or alone, if your main problem is self-criticism):

*1. **What happened?** Describe or write down in your own words what happened, but try to be as objective as possible. Use few adjectives.

*2. **What were your thoughts?** Describe the train of thoughts that went through your head

*3. **What did you feel?** Describe your emotions

*4. **Physical sensations?** Describe your physical sensations

*5. **How did you act?** Describe your actions, your behaviour. (""I shouted"", ""I cried"", ""I kicked the wall and ran upstairs"")

After all this, go over your thoughts and decide for each if they are true and/or helpful. If they are not both, they are of no use to you.

Example: your gf says to you ""I don't want you to wear those shoes tonight."" 

If one of your thoughts is ""You don't think I'm good enough for you."" this is not helpful and not true.

If one of your thoughts is ""I'm the one deciding what I wear."" this is a true and helpful thought.

If one of your thoughts is ""You can't tell me what to wear, damnit"" it might be true, but it's not helpful.

And all this time, you won't know why she wanted you to wear different shoes. she might have had a valid reason.

If you analyse your thoughts like that, you'll see patterns surfacing and you'll notice you're not so much reacting to the present situation.

Rather, you're reacting to a boatload of shit that you experienced in the past and that taught you how to deal with these situations. 

Now, your reaction is not helping you anymore, so you need to change tracks and find a way to hear what someone is *actually* saying. But you can only do that, if you help yourself to realise what goes wrong. 
Why does it make you so mad when someone does not like something you wear? Or if someone dislikes the music you like?

Disclaimer: most of this method is based on the principles of *rational emotive behavior therapy*. It's very effective, but it might take the explanation of a qualified therapist or coach to reap its full benefits. Which I'm not. 

**tl;dr Sit down and write down what happened, what you thought, what you felt, how you acted and wether your thoughts were both helpful and true.**

Example: Adam Sessler and JRPGs.  That's not to say that I won't read a review that includes subjectivity, but at least I can find valid information that I care about in the objective parts.

Why a game failed is also not necessarily tied to how good a game is, even in terms of objectivity and subjectivity.  As an example: CoD Ghosts on the current gen consoles has been fundamentally flawed as not really looking that much different than it was on last gen consoles, and was considered more of the same.  Yet it's the highest selling game on the current gen consoles."

Astero BPC costs 30k LP, 15m ISK and nets 85m ISK on the market, so 70m/30k ~ 2.3k ISK/LP **including** manufacturing cost.

Anjeer,TrueReddit,1389168603.0,"I was curious, so I ran some numbers.

1250 hours is the required number of hours to qualify. 

Let's assume an 8 hour work day, working 52 weeks per year. Also assume you work exactly three of these work days per week. 

&gt;8 hr/day * 3 day/wk = 24 hr/wk

&gt;24 hr/wk * 52 wk/yr = 1248 hr/yr

At first, 1250 seemed kind of random. But it makes sense as a solid place to differentiate between part time and half time employment. 

Yes, I'm borrowing that term from college enrollment. It's more specific than the general ""part time"" that covers everyone working from 1 hour per week to those working 39. 

The vast majority of people I know working 24&lt;x&lt;40 hours per week are often those who depend entirely on that salary to just meet their basic needs. And often they are limited to one job because of job scarcity. "

I feel considerably less self-conscious around the middle-aged moms who frequent the women's gym. 

Women's gyms are more likely to actively cultivate an encouraging and welcoming environment, in my experience. The branding, instructors, and general attitudes there are less intimidating. They're also less competitive, which is why they appeal to women like me who just want to get a general workout without much fanfare, but is also probably why I rarely see women at them who are interested in serious lifting. It's a low-key environment that appeals to low-key women who don't want to be hassled or made to feel uncomfortable. I'm sure this doesn't describe all women's gyms, but that's my experience with them at least."
