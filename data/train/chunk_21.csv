Don't you for a moment think that you had anything to do with her getting cancer!  

You had nothing to do with her getting sick, but you can have a part in her recovery.  Be a good son.  My father was diagnosed with Cancer in 2008, just over a year before I was getting married.  My dad is a very generous person with a good heart who only ever wanted the best for his kids.  My fiance and I were willing to either move the wedding to that summer or postpone it until he recovered, but he would have nothing of it.  He insisted that we continue to plan and that no matter what he would be at the wedding.  And I admit that I cried when he told me, I was 27 and I cried like I was 10 when they told me my grandfather passed away.

He was there and is now 5 years cancer free.  He's an agnostic.  God did not give him cancer and God did not cure it.  Honestly it was my Dog that played a large part in his recovery at home.  The Dog wouldn't let him pity himself or sit around the house and do nothing.  The Dog gave him a reason to get out of bed every morning and face the day.  Through out everything they were inseparable.  

You can do more for you mom by just being there.  Talk about your day and make sure you are also living your life.  Have fun.  Having watched my dad go through it I now understand how important it was to him to make sure my brother, my mom, my fiance and I that we all were happy.

I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis almost 2 year ago now, and I my wifes uncle had the nerve to mention that God gave me it because I am an atheist.  I can not relate the level of resentment I had for him at that moment in time.  That he would dare think that his all loving and compassionate God would punish me with an incurable, debilitating, and painful disease because I do not believe with out evidence.  We don't talk to that part of the family anymore.

Try another Mosque, another Imam if you feel the need to a religious leader to talk to.  Honestly even a Christian pastor would be willing to listen to you if you need.

And we here in r/Atheism will always be here to listen and offer advice.

**TL:DR** Don't for a moment think that you had anything to do with her getting sick.  But you can have a huge part in her fight and recovery."

lwboehm,nfl,1389653582.0,"I think OP understands this and is questioning why the rule is the way it is. (I could be wrong, but that is how I understood it)

Basically he is saying since an offside results in such a small gain for the offense when they are super close to the endzone, why not just jump over the line every time to gain an edge with the way the rules are now.

Honestly, rewarding a first down to the offense doesn't sound terrible to me when the penalty is larger than the distance to the endzone. If you are in the middle of the field and the defense jumps offsides on 3&amp;1 the offense gets a new set of down, but why not when it is 3&amp;goal at the 1.

If the OP could be sure of that, you might have a point. But don't you think the secret is going to come out sooner or later?
Maybe the husband will suspect, because the child doesn't look like him, or like their other children. Maybe he will come across a text message or email from the biological father. Or maybe the child will have some medical issue which just so happens to require a blood test or something.

Is it better for the family for this bombshell to go off when the child is 2 years old? 8 years old? 23? Would the child feel better about finding out that they've been raised on a lie?

That implies causation though, which as you know, correlation doesn't.

&gt; People unload this shit because they want to make themselves feel better, not help someone out

Or they just don't share your optimistic belief that if just the OP keeps the secret, then the husband will never know, and they'll live happily ever after.

Honestly, if there was a guarantee that ""the husband will never find out, unless the OP spills the beans"", then I might be more inclined to agree with you. But I'm more of a pessimist. I'm going to assume that the husband, and the child, are going to find out sooner or later. And I don't think it would hurt them *less* to find out 10 years from now."

Zeydon,PoliticalDiscussion,1389654935.0,"You can't force yourself to care about things you're not interested about.  So consider what ideals are important to you, and then see how those ideas manifest in the world around you.

For example, people that care about global warming tend to be that way because they're concerned about the world future generations of humans are going to inherit, or if they'll even be around to inherent anything.  Since they care about this ISSUE, they then look to politics to see which policy makers more closely align with their views on this subject, and will then use this passion to inform who they align with politically and it fosters interest in political battles, because they see that it has a value to them.

If you don't care about any of issues at stake, you're not going to care about politics any more than you would the latest celebrity gossip.

Inkshooter,TumblrInAction,1389655670.0,"If it were just a blog about black people in historic art, that would be cool, and I would probably even follow it. But the author jumps to the most absurd conclusions based on hunches and preconceived ideas s/he has rather than just post the art, and people BELIEVE this made-up crap. 

This logic only applies to Europe, as well. For instance, West African peoples would sometimes create carvings or bronze sculptures of Portuguese traders they encountered. Obviously, there weren't huge settlements of Portuguese folks in Africa, just travelers, merchants, and ambassadors. MedievalPOC has posted on this subject before, and came to the same conclusion.

Say the inverse were to happen in Portugal, however, with a visitor from, for instance, the kingdom of Kongo, which historically was on good terms with the Portuguese. Upon his arrival, a court painter would paint his picture, because such an exotic traveler was a curiosity that was worth portraying. Despite this being an isolated incident, however, MedievalPOC would take it as evidence that Lisbon (and indeed, all of Europe) was utterly teeming with non-Europeans, which is ridiculous.

I'm also flustered by the often inaccurate label of 'medieval'. The 1700s were not Medieval by any stretch of the imagination, nor was Classical antiquity.

To quote [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/say.html), ""The spread of the term 'political correctness' meant the beginning of the end of political correctness, because it enabled one to attack the phenomenon as a whole without being accused of any of the specific heresies it sought to suppress.""

It's difficult to complain about individual issues. If I were to speak up about how affirmative action for women is a bad idea, I would be attacked as being a sexist and would then have to spend my time defending myself instead of actually talking about the issues at hand. But by stepping back and saying that I oppose the entire idea of social justice warriors defending ""oppressed"" minorities, it becomes much more clear what I'm talking about. It also becomes much more difficult to attack my position because I'm speaking out against blatant unfairness and speaking up for meritocracy, not specific things that allow detractors to say, ""HE HATES WOMEN!"""

Here's some sentences I'd fix:

&gt;The connection between minutes and waves is a very effective way to portray to the reader that time keeps on going in a never ending cycle. Another way to look at it is that waves are seen coming in, and as they crash onto the shore they are seemingly disappear, never to be seen again. In the same way that minutes pass and memories are made, but you can never have those minutes back again.

This was pretty long-winded. Here's how I'd say it:

&gt;By comparing minutes to waves, Shakespeare develops time as an endless cycle. Similarly, just as waves crash onto the shore and disappear, moments of time elapse and can never be restarted.

You also need to work on integrating the quotations you have in the text. Try to cut the quotes so that the sentence flows naturally. For example, instead of

&gt;He says, “Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth” basically saying that time destroys the innocence of youth, because as time goes on people are forced to grow up and conform to the real world, and the reality of the real world hits them much harder than they were ever expecting. 

try

&gt;Shakespeare notes that “time doth transfix the flourish set on youth.” This deft sentence develops the sobering realities of the loss of innocence. Time, according to Shakespeare, forces people to leave their youthful qualities behind in order to conform with standards set by society as they age.

This guy told me that this girl that I wanted so bad has a STD and got pregnant. But not with some rich dude's kid but with a guy who was in jail. I saw her working one of three jobs at the mall. I told myself whenever I got a job that made me a lot of money then I would get a Rolex. I bought the Rolex and wore it with boardshorts and asked her if she liked it. Never in my life have I been so happy to have dodged a bullet.

tl;dr- Like everyone else I met a golddigger. I got a lot of money from my dad. She now works three jobs because Hawaii is expensive and she has a kid from a deadbeat and herpes. And I bought an expensive watch and made her watch me buy it.

background edit- I never really got along with my father. His sole motivation in life was money to the point that he alienated himself away from all his family. At his funeral, only six people showed up. This is including the priest, the alter-boy, and the Deacon. We had to have the Hearse driver help us with the casket.  "

Asians, middle eastern, latina, all have huge flaws that are often overlooked here.  Often, there is a huge over idealization and infatuation with women from a ""less western"" culture.  I speak from experience when I tell you this.  I'm mexican and whenever I hear white guys talk about hispanic women, they're either only being exposed to the positives, or are choosing to ignore the negatives.  Either way they're in for a bumpy road if they start generalizing like this.

There are certain cultures which you may be more compatible with, but make no mistake, as soon as she gets any sort of exposure to western culture, you better be prepared to draw clear boundaries because women absolutely hate being part of the socially different."

If a kid is identified as lagging in important milestones (often, but not always, due to being a preemie or having some kind of challenging gestation/birth), they often qualify for services from your local school district. It's federal law that everyone is entitled to a full education, and many schools noticed that it's actually a lot *cheaper* to give kids a couple of years of speech therapy and other support and help them not *need* special education all their lives. Now it's the law, although it changes from state to state how Early Intervention is carried out. Typical supports include speech therapy (which includes language acquisition), occupational therapy (which can cover things with very young kids like trouble swallowing, and with older kids gaining the motor control necessary to get dressed--especially after toileting), even physical therapy to help kids with low muscle tone or physical limitations. Basically, helping kids get things they'll need to be successful in school, even kindergarten. Many kids in EI go to preschool early (2 and 9 mid, iirc). "

rbaltimore,MultipleSclerosis,1389658888.0,"I was diagnosed at 23 and had MS through two pregnancies. One ended at 5 months for unrelated reasons, and one resulted in the 3.5 year old boy who is currently bouncing on the couch next to me, claiming to be Spiderman.

During both pregnancies, I felt FANTASTIC. It was like my MS just disappeared. No more tremors, no more myoclonus, my energy levels were better, it was awesome.

Then my son was born and the magic went away :/ I didn't get worse than I had been, I was just so spoiled from 15 months of no symptoms (the pregnancies had only 7 months between them.)

I had my first real relapse when my son was 18 months, I developed some vision problems. My next (and last) relapse was in May. My doctor switched my off of the Copaxone I was on, onto Tecfidera.

I did not breastfeed my son. My son needs me healthy and able to care for him more than he needs breastmilk. My husband and I felt that the benefits of breastfeeding did not come anywhere near to outweighing the risks that I would have a sudden, catastrophic relapse with permanent debilitating effects. Our son needs me to be able to take him to school, drive him to Grandma's house, build forts in the living room, snuggle after bath time, go on weekly 'dates' (Starbucks, the doughnut shop, etc.), and cart home 7,000 superhero books from the library. Breastfeeding works for some MS moms, I just didn't go that route. He did just fine on formula.

My son knows that I have MS. He knows that I have an owie in my brain. Sometimes mommy has to wear an eyepatch like a pirate, and sometimes instead of going to the library we lay on the couch and watch Dora, and sometimes my arms and legs will move for no reason, but he doesn't much think about it. That's what makes me mom just as much as red hair makes my husband dad.

I hate being sick. I hate not being like other moms. You won't see family photos from a beach vacation, we tried that once, I just short circuited. I don't know what I'm going to do if he wants to play soccer or softball or whatever. I'm hoping he wants to play ice hockey instead. I don't think I could handle more kids, but fortunately we only wanted one. But he doesn't see any of that, he's a happy kid. So that's what keeps me going."

In my usage, anyway, a direct quote with ""say"" is implied to be something like an exact quote, whereas ""to be like"" can introduce paraphrase or something that might've even been unsaid but implied.

&gt;Sure, but all that means is that say can introduce indirect or direct speech and be like can only introduce direct speech. There are plenty of languages where that distinction doesn't even exist and I'm pretty sure everything expressible in indirect speech is also expressible with direct speech.

It's possible to express it, but are there languages incapable of quoting indirect speech?  It seems to me English has that need for it, or at least uses it enough to preserve the usage."

But if your state has emissions, a cheap $75-100 catalytic converter isnt going to cut it. If put on it's just going to make the check engine light come back on and not pass emissions. The reason cheap catalytic converters are so cheap is because they don't have near as much catalyst material in them to work efficiently.

You Cai (Yu Choi) - I really like using these for a stir fry with beef and Sha Cha Jiang (Chinese BBQ Sauce). Cook up some velveted beef and season well with the Chinese BBQ Sauce. Throw in some chopped up You Cai and serve over rice or tossed with some freshly cooked flour noodles.

Then one day, out of a clear blue sky, he told me he thought I was cute, but would be beautiful if I weighed around 300-320 pounds. I was already overweight, about 190 at 5'7. I've struggled with self-esteem issues my whole life, and had just gotten back into better eating habits and an exercise routine. Apparently my drop from 200 to 190 over the course of two or three months was way too much. It was one of the worst feelings ever, to feel bad about my body in a whole new way. I'm too fat for everyone else and too skinny for my boyfriend? Fuck that. I told him I refused to make myself unhealthy for him. He hemmed and hawed for a while, but eventually things settled. He ended up breaking up with me after eight months for something unrelated, but thank the gods it didn't happen after I'd gained 100+ pounds.

It sounds like your family is like that. Not to speak badly of them, but I think it comes from insecurity. But it's justifiable insecurity. It's a giant world filled with millions of decisions to make every single day. It's overwhelming to anyone when you think about it. And so the idea of God is a comfort to those people. Someone a lot more wise and knowing than them is looking out for them, and helping them with all those decisions. And if it helps them, all the better. It's just the way they act towards you with it that isn't cool.

I don't know if this will help you. It only will if you happen to feel the same way. But what I've told my family is that I just have this unexplainable feeling that everything will always work out in the end. I rarely worry about most decisions because of it. I mean, so far life's just worked out, so it's probably just confirmation bias. I'm not religious. I don't think it's a higher power guiding me. But the feeling is real. And they enjoy knowing that. I know it makes them feel better. They can believe whatever they want to about it. So if you have anything like that, mention it to them. And if you don't, that's still okay too.

werewolfchow,AskReddit,1389661230.0,"Yeah, I at least know the difference here. Remember that all the good officials move up to higher levels of basketball, so the guys who did your league when you were 12 were not the best available. If you went to a smaller school, you got shittier officials because the better ones went to different leagues.

That being said, I would probably not call the charges you describe at all. Even though it is a player-control foul *technically*, better officials do not impose themselves on the game unless there is some sort of advantage gained. 

It seems unfair to you but if the dribbler bounces off of you he probably lost the trade off and the ball is up for grabs. I wouldn't call that because it removes the chance for your team to play the ball with one of their guys on the floor. Obviously the context matters a great deal. If it's the last play of the game and the score is tied, I'm going to select my calls differently than in the first half of a blow out.


The big officiating secret is that ""fair"" doesn't mean ""equal"" when it comes to calls. Did that guy just hit your arm? Absolutely. But your team is up 30 points, the contact didn't screw up your shot, and it's his 4th foul. I'm not calling that.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1389661291.0,"Slardar: Get treads, stick/wand, and a vanguard OR armlet. After that, you can farm blink if you want, or you can leave the lane. Regardless of which choice you make, you should start doing objectives with your team once you have most or all of your core up. Slardar doesn't farm very well, so it is imperative that you use his midgame fighting ability well. In some cases, you can wait until you get blink and even bkb before leaving lane, but those are situational.

Wraith King: Like Slardar, the King simply cannot farm quickly to compete with many other lategame carries (and even some midgame ones). Thus, roaming in the midgame rather than afk farming can be a great help to your team. Shadowblade is a good item on him if this is your plan. Blink and force staff also achieve the same means, although I like blink the least since it provides only the mobility (Which is normally better on most heroes, but since Wraith King needs more than pure mobility the other options are better). I've also heard of Orchid to make him into a semicarryish ganker, but I've never tried that myself.

reinventingmyself,AskMen,1389661338.0,"In college, a woman transferred in from a nearby school to the department in which most of my friends took classes. She was very attractive, so most of the guys took notice quickly. She became part of our large social group and hung out with us regularly. I became interested in her and I *thought* she might be interested in me, but nothing came of it.

Eventually, she started dating one of my roommates. While I was slightly disappointed that my chances with her were shot, she was fun to have around as a friend, both at social gatherings and just hanging around at my apartment.

Later on, things soured between her and my roommate and they broke up. By that point I had stopped seeing her as a romantic/sexual interest, and trying to date her would have been weird, anyway, given her history with my roommate. After a while, she started hanging out with us at our apartment again, but she often ended up spending the night in my roommate's room... None of us really talked about it, but we knew they had some kind of friends-with-benefits thing going on.

One day, while she was hanging out at our place, I decided I was going to walk over to the nearby Chinese buffet for dinner. She joined me, so we ate dinner together. During dinner and in the middle of a bit of a break in conversation she looked up at me and said ""So... how come you never asked me out?""

I don't remember the specific phrasing of my response, but I had to tactfully explain to her that constantly hooking up with my roommate was not the best way to show that she was interested in me."

The MIC finds pretexts to start war because it's good for business. Gulf of Tonkin is a perfect example, and the fact that we sent hundreds of thousands of ground troops instead of just bombing the fuck out of the NVA. Or the time when Libya started to not accept USD for natural resources, then they magically become an enemy. Or when Iran nationalized their oil until we had a say in it and overthrew their government. Or when in Iraq, we used to be friends with Saddam until he nationalized his oil. We were cross drilling oil from Iraq into Kuwait for fucks sake. It's obvious these wars are for resources and profits. Our government follows the business model and the business model is to make the most money as possible at whatever costs. It's not hard to believe when you have psychopath CEO's in a back room making the important decisions. Money=power and when corporations become as big as they are, they are the ones with power, in the big picture. Corporations start these wars. Ever hear of Iran-Contra, or when the CIA overthrew the Guatemalan government so the United Fruit Company would profit tremendously. That was one corporation. Think of what happens when multiple corporations get together and come up with these types of plans. You get large scale conflicts. Everything I said is all common knowledge.

Renner1,worldnews,1389661671.0,"&gt; I don't see a difference between attacking someone based on their ethnicity or their sexuality. In Nazi Germany, many homosexuals were killed in concentration camps. Are those deaths any less heinous than the other deaths?

What about the Roma and the Slavs targeted by the Sonderkommando and the totenkopf? 
Hardly anyone mentions them, it's always the Jews or the Communists, or the homosexuals--  the last of which who were a minority of the people who died in the camps.

&gt; Stereotypical Western European/North American ""gay culture"" is very much about pushing a flamboyant appearance and exaggerated attitude with everyone you come into contact with.

There should be no need to constantly talk about what you like to do in the bedroom, especially if other people don't want to hear about it.

&gt; So you don't believe freedom of expression should be a universal right?

No, I don't. I don't believe that the likes of extreme Salafi Jihadis or neo-nazis ought to have any civil rights at all, and I don't think the vast majority of enthusiastic Zionists should have rights like freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and that sort of thing.

Just the most extreme examples of people, mind you. I could go on about this but it's not too relevant.

&gt; Not all of the people arrested in Russia were militant gay rights activists. Some are just a gay couple holding hands or kissing. 

Yes, but all the ""gay propaganda"" legislation has to do with the screaming, rainbow flag waving, cross-dressing aggressive LGBT sorts.

&gt; Also, people tend to be more militant about their cause when they are being legally oppressed. They are fighting for their freedom.

I suppose you could say that. It is rather different then most cases of people responding to violence or oppression against them, though-- not least because there's no existential issue apart from ""it's illegal to act in this flamboyant hyper-sexual way that's based on some exaggerated caricature of homosexual behaviour"".

&gt; I don't know how the Russian people in general feel about gay people. I don't think the homophobes are a majority though.

I think a majority of them wouldn't care enough about what two adults do in the bedroom, but a majority of Russians see the exaggerated Western European ""flamboyant gay culture"" as a symptom of having mental problems.

It's truly a massive stumbling block in the way of the stated goals of the LGBTs."

Sorry I just am biased to the use of antidepressants, but I'm not blind to when they are needed and the fact they do help people.. 

But if your worried about any potential interaction, take your medication as directed and wait 12 hours before smoking, so you could take your SSRIs during the morning and smoke when you go to bed.

I did a quick browse to double check and did not find any significant findings between the two. SSRIs work by preventing the re-uptake of serotonin into the pre-synaptic cell and so there is more serotonin available to bind to the post-synaptic receptor. THC stimulates the release of dopamine (and does other things which are unrelated to SSRIs).

So there's some science behind the reasoning to make you feel better :)

jeffseadot,Terraria,1389662400.0,"Welcome to the game!

If you haven't built houses yet, that's a good starter project.  Not only will your eventual NPCs need a place to live (one house per NPC), but it's an easy way to get to know the basics of building and crafting.  Different NPCS have different conditions that need to be met before they spawn, and I don't know how helpful the guide is on that one.... since I used the wiki when I was new.  But yeah, houses for NPCs.

I've had random zombies and such drop on me many times when I've been digging underground.  Sometimes I'm close enough to the surface that they walk into my hole, other times they spawn above me and fall in.  It happens.  The good news is that they're easy to kill, so it's just not that big a deal if a zombie falls on you.  Kill it and move on.  Bonus awesome when your pickaxe is strong enough that you don't even need to swap weapons :D

Corruption isn't a big deal prior to Hardmode.  It doesn't spread very quickly, and can be blocked easily.  It's a tough place to be until you get decent armor and some health hearts, but it quickly becomes no big deal.  During Hardmode, it's considerably more aggressive.

Hope you're having fun!"

*Seriously. They had no MRI. They had no cat scan (to rule out a brain tumor). The only doctor who could do a lumbar puncture was literally gone fishin', and it didn't matter because they didn't have a lab to run the test (or the ELISA to rule out Lyme), so they would have to freeze the samples and then send them to the hospital at WVU, and they'd have the results in 'a week or two'.

Penultimatum,todayilearned,1389663372.0,"Huh. Then my parents must speak some weird combination of Hindi and Punjabi at home and I've never been the wiser.

Though I feel like part of our different translations stem from differences in transcribing Hindi and Punjabi into English characters. I think ""nahin"" is just another way to semi-phonetically spell ""naeen."" Same with ""kuch/kuj,"" ""ay/hai,"" and ""to/tay."" And it seems like ""ho se"" would be a different conjugation of ""hai.""

I grew up in America and my primary exposure to Punjabi and Hindi (I thought mostly just Punjabi, but I'm now learning I might be mistaken) is from my parents speaking it at home. I guess that and the fact that Punjabi and Hindi share similar roots confused me a bit.

Thinking about it, I think the way I would hear your translation heard at home would be:

It's definitely possible for things to either leave the picture or be so completely transformed into something else that they're not recognizable (I.e. gills to lungs) but if you look at the DNA, there's a lot of leftover code that was useful for previous species but is no longer important, so it's been shut off and forgotten.

Evolution isn't a clean, clear process with a certain end goal; it's just the natural survival of what works. So if a certain gene is no longer beneficial, it might be lost, moved, rendered useless by a mutation, etc. Ultimately you end up with creatures that have leftovers (physically and in their genes) from previous generations, which may be beneficial, harmful, or neutral. If they're harmful, they might be selected against (only if they interfere with reproduction), and if they're beneficial or neutral they'll probably stick around.

No, it isn't.  That's the point of the voter ID laws that the left opposes so strongly.  Without them, the only way it gets proved is by accident or when people are stupid.

&gt; Turns out that even though people can do it, they don't because the penalties for voter fraud outweigh any advantage so much that no one even bothers to do it.

Citations please.  You can't prove it isn't happening - only that people aren't getting caught by virtually nonexistent detection measures.

As to penalties, those apply only if someone is caught in the act and apprehended.  Since most voter fraud is currently only detected after the fact, there is a pretty low risk of that - and the risk is even lower for illegal aliens, who face no penalty beyond deportation.

&gt; If they could just propose an idea to fix a problem that probably doesn't exist that doesn't ""coincidentally"" impact people voting for the other guys at a much higher margin, I'll be all for it.

The house of delegates is a 54-46 Democrat majority, and have had a majority since 1930. The current Lt. Governor is a Democrat. Both US Senators are Democrats, and they haven't had a Republican US Senator since 1958. They may not be the most progressive of Democrats, but they are Democrats none the less.

And of course cost of living doesn't appear to be of any factor in this list. 

Yeah wages suck in Idaho, I get it. But I don't think it is even close to being in the top 10 poorest states. Median home value in California was $355,600 in 2011, in Idaho it was $158,800. That is just one cost of living factor. I'm much too lazy to compare all the other factors.

PlayTheBanjo,AskReddit,1389664618.0,"A guy I knew (kind of a friend, not too close) was of Colombian heritage (I forget if he was born in the USA or Colombia).  We'll call him Raul.

He went on a trip to visit his grandparents or something in Colombia.

A note: our high school was a public school, but it was still a pretty good school, all things considered.  It was generally pretty opulent and there were few problems with fighting or crime or truancy etc.  As such, the administration would often just make shit up (""You can't wear a sequin dress to the formal dance.  Why?  Fuck you, that's why."" ""New school rule.  Girls have to get on the bus first."") and one time even tried to institute a rule where you could be given school discipline (detention, suspension, etc.) for stuff you did off of school grounds not during school hours.  Break a school rule in your house and they find out about it through a rumor?  Detention.  They were big on overreaching into students' personal lives and trying to control everything.

Back to the story.  Before Raul leaves, he tells my friend ""Joe"" to start a rumor that while abroad in Colombia, he would be kidnapped by a Colombian drug cartel and held ransom due to him being an American from a wealthy area.  Of course, I didn't spread the rumor but I was one of the people who was in on the joke what with Joe being my friend and all.

Joe was popular and highly charismatic and intelligent.  He successfully got basically everyone in school thinking that Raul was being held at machete point on a remote cocaine farm outside Bogata for a $4,000,000 ransom.  Teachers started to take notice.  Meanwhile, I find this shit hilarious.

Raul comes back to the states.  He gets called to the principal's office.  When he arrives, he finds the principal, vice principal, all the guidance counselors and school psychologists waiting for him.  They say they heard what he endured and knew it must have been a terrible ordeal.  They can't imagine what kind of tortures he was subject to.  They are here for him to give him all the therapy and counseling he needs and there's no reason to be embarrassed or scared.

""Actually... that was... just a rumor that Joe started.""

The gathered school administrators and staff stare blankly at him.

""You know, you can get him in a lot of trouble for making something like that up about you.""

""...I... kind of told him to do it.""

""Oh.  Well you shouldn't joke about that kind of thing.  This is really serious"" and gave him shit over how many people were put on red alert over it.

Personally, I think those fuckers got what they deserved for getting involved in students' lives over rumors."

Others have said it more eloquently than I could, but the short short version is that, while high school right now is your entire world, in a few years and thereafter you will give next to zero fucks about it and what transpired during it.   Roll the dice and ask her out if you really want to date her and she is available.  It may work out but, yes, it well may not and as a result of the latter you no longer will be in contact with her.  Think about how very few high school relationships result in marriage when you decide what to do:  at worst, she says no and you lose her acquaintanceship; at best, you marry her.  A lot of positive possibilities fall between those two poles.  In any event, you will learn something about yourself and how to handle relationships by asking her out, so from my position of absolute safety I recommend that you make your move."

If you have short hairs further back on the top, then it is breakage...
I'd say check with your hairstylist to rule out breakage. 

Ninja edit: Another thing that can cause breakage besides the obvious culprits such as flat iron and blow dryer, is brushing your hair too aggressively. When brushing hair, work in sections and hold the hair so you don't stress the roots. First detangle the lower parts and then brush carefully from the top. I really like those new detangle brushes for this. I got one at TK Maxxx (German version of your TJ Maxxx) for 3 Euro."

Blink gives Clinkz more damage during ganks because he can blink to continue chasing them, getting more usage out of strafe. 

In the same vein, Blink gives Legion Commander at least as much DPS than shadow blade in many circumstances, because you can use her buff then immediately blink and duel. With Shadowblade, you're much less likely to be able to use the buff and duel to its fullest extent, and you're certainly not going to be able to hit the opponent out of shadowblade, then buff, then duel most of the time.

Okay.  Hmmm...happened twenty years ago.  And...?

&gt;They even made an oscar-winning movie about him.

A movie which I recall watching and which even at the time of release was considered to be sensational and [not a completely factually based account of events.](http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/07/entertainment/ca-61809)  Are you really wishing to use films 'based on a true story' as your barometer? Because technically according to its director The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is also 'based on a true story' is you want to come down to it.

Not to mention how the film you laud completely erases the murder of the African American man who was also murdered by the two in order to focus on the person the script-writer fell in love with!  Who even remembers Philip Devine these days?  Why focus on the murder of a man who climbed mountains on one foot, when we could instead focus on a [genderqueer boy^*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer) who wrote bad checks?

Finally I find it interesting that in the Brandon Teena case everyone paints Lana Tisdale as an innocent.  I mean *really?*  A woman seeks out an ex-boyfriend to find out the truth about the guy she's currently seeing?  This is a volatile situation never before seen on this subredddit! /s

No one ever questions the possible revenge aspect, instead they'd rather make use of a mentally retarded violent ex-convict man and his emotionally unstable ex-convict friend to bash an entire gender.  Nice.

^* I think genderqueer probably makes more sense as a label for Brandon Teena than transman simply because of how many ways he tried to be fluid with his gender, calling himself a hermaphrodite and so on.  So you see I *have* given the subject some thought and if you notice I consistently use his assumed preferred gender throughout my comment.  Sadly as he is not here he is unable to speak for himself despite the vast number of people who choose to do so for him."

FTA: 

&gt; why are hospitals having such a hard time doing simple, cost-free things to save lives?

This is a bad question.  Nothing in business is free.  Everything has a cost to someone.  It may be that the cost of doing those things is less than the cost of not doing them - that would be a useful argument to try to make - but that does not make them cost free.

&gt; He and I were sitting next to each other afterward, and I said, ""That doesn't bring costs down. The marginal cost of doing MRIs is zero. You already have the machine; you already have the technician. You're confusing price and cost.""

Again, very bad.

Lets assume for a moment that the hospital doesn't already have an MRI.  Instead it contracts out with another facility that does, paying a premium to do so, and working around their schedule.

How much extra does the hospital have to charge in order to afford an MRI and technician of its own?

Once it has them, the technician is overhead associated with the MRI, the MRI itself has operating and maintenance costs, and will eventually have to be replaced - that replacement cost has to be figured into the cost of doing MRIs as well.  Under no scenario is the cost of doing the MRI zero."

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389665243.0,"Unfortunately that's just what you pay.

If I want full time care for an infant (&lt;18 months) in a daycare centre, I'm looking at up to $1700 per month.  Yeah, $20k.  As it happens, it would still be worth it for me to go back to work.  But OUCH! Meanwhile, we pay $8k per year for preschool care, so I don't know how to compare your $10k average.

I am a big advocate of in-home care.  Dayhomes are not necessarily unlicensed or unregulated, that really depends on where you are.  Without knowing what city or state you're in I can't help you there.  Here there are licensed dayhomes and unlicensed.  I've used both.  It is a more personal arrangement than a daycare, you know the caregiver, it's the same person everyday, it is basically a nanny but in their own home rather than yours.  Quite often you're getting a stay at home mom who is just taking on extra kids to help make ends meet, and they're great at it.  Look for dayhome agencies in your area.  The dayhome agencies we've worked with all have specific standards for training, caregiver:child ratios, scheduling, food and activities, and the agency does regular surprise inspections that the parents receive reports from.  You can also drop in unannounced and see whats up.

It is a big leap of faith leaving your baby with someone else, but from my experience that's true anywhere.  I can honestly tell you that my kids were better cared for in dayhomes than in daycares.  Not that anything really bad ever happened, but they were generally cleaner and stayed out of trouble better.  I have found that there is a much more personal and caring relationship with a dayhome provider than the daycares can offer.  There are pros and cons to both.  You can get to know people in advance, spend a bit of time visiting with them, do some part days and short trials to get baby accustomed to it.  Then you take the leap, and watch out for warning signs.

The warning signs are the same you watch for with a daycare.  Are the diapers always dirty/wet when you pick them up?  Are they always hungry?  Are they clean?  Do they seem well rested or are they unable to sleep at night?  Do their supplies appear to be used in reasonable time?  Make sure you know about arrangements for outings.

If you are willing to consider in-home care I recommend shopping around a lot well in advance.  Ask for references from current clients.  It is especially useful to speak with parents of older children as references because older children are able to vocalize how things are at the dayhome.

Then you just have to budget for it.  Figure out whether the savings for part-time care are worth the difficulty of offsetting your schedules.  Because caregivers lose a full time spot when they take a part-time child there won't always be much benefit."

PlushieChomby,AdviceAnimals,1389665367.0,"Sorry this happened to you dude, but if I might suggest something for the future: when you want a relationship and someone tells you they just want things to stay the same, you *always* have the option of telling them that things can't stay the same because you want more than just friendship with them. 

If you *can* set aside your feelings and convert to just platonic feelings, that's great and do so if you think it's worth it. It may take some time apart to clear your head and set yourself strait, it might mean you're not doing things for her you were doing before (especially things usually found inside an intimate relationship), and it may mean realizing you don't want to be friends if you can't be more. 

If you can't work through your feelings and convert to a platonic mentality, it's better to put space between you and cut ties than it is to spend years (or months, or even weeks) hung up on someone you can't be with in the way you really want. Who knows who else in life is passing you by while you're busy looking at someone you're not with and unlikely (at that point) to be with in the future? 

I've experienced both. I've had friends confess their feelings for me, and when I didn't reciprocate, they told me it was too painful to stick around and watch me date other guys (which I totally understand). I've had friends who decided they could stay my friend when I didn't feel the same way about them as they felt about me, and while many of them took a break from hanging out all the time, it was comforting to know when we started chilling again that this time we were both on the same page. I've also had friends who swore up and down that nothing had to change and it was cool that I didn't like them that way, then their actions would later reveal that to be a lie - leading to the inevitable alterations in friendship. 

I also had one close friend who confessed love for me, but I wasn't in the right place at the time and couldn't feel it back. He rightfully put space and distance between us, and when we met up again over a year later, I'd formed feelings for him I'd previously not realized were possible. Kind of a case of absence making the heart grow fonder. His feelings for me hadn't changed and we had a pretty stellar relationship. 

The bottom line is, good people don't like watching other people get hurt. People worth knowing won't say that nothing can change when things *clearly* can't stay the same - instead they'll be considerate of your feelings and try to find a workable solution. People not very adept at being human keep around backups and Feel-Good-Machines without regard to what it's doing to them. 

If you're still hung up on her, think about telling her that your romantic feelings for her haven't changed and while you'd love to be more than friends, the way things are isn't good for you. If she doesn't understand that and try to work through it with you, she's not actually a close friend and you'd be better off finding someone who is. The thought of her pushing you away might suck right now or sound unbearable, but if you don't do something, nothing will ever change until life events force them to do so. 

Or have you thought about dating other people? Finding someone who returns your romantic interest? That can be incredibly helpful on focusing your desires in a place where they belong and are readily accepted. "

Don't get too discouraged.  Just because plan A isn't looking good you don't have to jump straight to plan D.  There are steps in between.  At your next appointment see what the doctor says about your cervix and discuss options.  There is more than one way to induce.  If you are admitted and put on a pitocin drip you are probably at plan D, the contractions are much more intense and it is more difficult to manage pain.  However, you've got a couple of options for how to induce before that.  Something like cervadil can help ripen your cervix and speed things along, having your membranes swept is inducing as well.  Talk to your doctor about those options and do whatever you can to prompt labour before you jump to the IV option and you may still get the delivery you want.

She may just be really inexperienced with this relationship thing. While being pissed off at something small all day long isn't great for you, her or your relationship, you might still have a chance to work at that. You just need to sit her down sometime and talk with her about it. Don't accuse her and tell her ""what you did was shit"", but try the whole ""it's our problem"" route. Tell her you think you're having problems communicating at times and that you would like to set some boundaries about what behaviour you two deem appropriate and what you think is bad. Also maybe tell her that it hurts you being at will of her moodswings

I can tell you from my own experience: My mom did use silence to punish me, instead of screaming/discussing or anything. I forgot to take the flowers for my girlfriends' mother with me once when I was fifteen, I got ignored for two weeks. Didn't matter what I said, how much I apologized etc., I was being ignored for 2 weeks straight - no food, no drinks(well, I had water), no money, I got completely cut off from everything. Always had to hide a bit of emergency money somewhere. And that's just one of these instances. I copied this behaviour when I got into my first relationship, just ignored my girlfriend everytime I was upset at her, or was passive agressive the rest of the day. I didn't know of any other way.

It took us a lot of talks and a shit-ton of self-improvement on my part to work through this. It's been 6 1/2 years so far, and we've cut it down to me needing about 30 minutes of cooldown time for myself when an argument gets heated(although we obviously try to avoid that, sometimes it just happens). It's not yet ideal, and I'd really like to improve myself to not engage in heated arguements at all, but it works for now, and that's what matters.

I asked my girlfriend what approach *she* preferred when she was angry, too. Chocolate, self-heating pads and a few hugs work for her(lucky me). So we usually know how to behave around each other and what to do to calm us down.

Now you're in a very fresh relationship, and the girl you're with is 4 years younger than you are, meaning there's a pretty big gap inbetween you two. It also means you didn't have as much time to get used to each other, yet. It may also explain why she thinks another girl may be better for you, maybe she's just really insecure about herself. She may just feel helplessly inexperienced. I'd just sit down with her and establish boundaries for the future. Communication is the best tool you've got in any relationship.

Ok, thanks. I never learned Punjabi in a formal way at all, but instead just picked it up through listening to my parents speak it throughout my life. Thanks for clearing that up!"

However, comic books are weird, and Flash can actually reach or even surpass light speed. (Depending on which version it is and what you consider canonical feats.) So I guess both you and OP are correct. Flash should create a black hole when he goes absurdly fast, but doesn't because speed force. Realistically, it should be called the Arbitrarily Large Amount of Mass Punch, but I guess IMP is a more attractive acronym than A LAMP.

Edit: wow I can't keep promises. I was curious about what kind of people would be on the sex offender list so I looked up zip codes I've lived in. 

In the suburban zip code it was mostly abuse of children with a rape and kiddy born thrown in. The urban zip code had way more people listed, over half of whom were already in jail. Did look through all of them but many had other crimes attached such as murder of threats with weapons.

Mongoosen42,vegan,1389667614.0,"I do have to say, there's something in the tone of your writing that I appreciate. Are your British by chance? The way you write reminds me of the dry sort of wit that my British friends often exhibit. Anyway, that's a tangent.

You are right, my argument to what you said is that, yes, a given animal will still die if you don't eat meat. No slaughter house is going to say, ""Hey, we have a report of this one guy going veg, better set one cow a month free."" and I get that. But if you were to choose to not eat meat, there would be less demand overall. Over time, there would be fewer animals raised for slaughter because of your decision. Furthermore, by consuming (and thus demanding) vegan products, you would also be marginally raising the profitability of of companies to produce such products, increasing their availability and thus helping to make it more convenient for other people to follow your example. Not to mention that as more people become vegan, it becomes more socially acceptable to do so, thus loosening the social inhabitions that prevent many others from making the switch.

So you see, while it is easy to get stuck in the nihilistic sensation that your actions are so miniscule that they don't make a difference, the truth is that we are all connected, and your actions do make a difference. When you go vegan, without ever saying a word or being preachy at all, you make a small but significant shift in society that causes other people to make that switch, who then further shift the societal trends of society.

Of course, if you are only eating meat once a week as you say you are, than you are already making a difference, and I commend the effort that you do make. You are doing more than most people. Obviously I would personally encourage you to, eventually, take the final step and cut out that last bit of meat altogether. For many of us it was a gradual process, and I myself spent over a year as a once a week meat eater, and then another while as a once a month meat eater, before finally deciding to be done with it for good.

In any case, I appreciate you taking the time to come and share your views with us. You've been respectful and polite, and that is always appreciated."

This will be totally subjective. I'd recommend getting a bit of everything and seeing what you like. For me, cotton is by far the easiest to work with but I know some people disagree!

The Igo, for sure. Build deck is simple and very straightforward. It's great to learn the basics without having to get frustrated at your build deck.

I don't think you're giving educated Chinese people enough credit when it comes to forming a more nuanced view of Westerners. Most of them have done travelling, studies abroad, and made Western friends. For example, most of the people in my program knew that those English teachers who make up quite a few of the Westerners in China are mostly people who couldn't make it back home and are hardly those rich Westerners with influence and power."

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1389668641.0,"The problems you are describing are consistent with a bad transmission. Do you know what solenoid they replaced? Had you checked the fluid before taking it in? Your first mistake was not doing any research or checking your trans fluid beforehand, Your second mistake was was taking it to the dealer. You need to specifically go to a transmission shop for this issue.

Get it away from the dealer. Check the fluid. If it's black, that along with the other symptoms you described sound like transmission failure. If the check engine light was on, you should have had some diagnostic trouble codes stored in the car's computer. They would have said something like ""TRANS INCORRECT GEAR RATIO"" or ""A/B SOLENOID FAULT""

I can only speculate that they misdiagnosed the problems as just a solenoid problem and put one on thinking it fixed the problem, then let you have the car. Or they only replaced the solenoid to get some money out of you, knowing you'd be back for a full transmission rebuild. I don't know. I can't say. Wasn't there.

I do know that as a transmission rebuilder myself, I can say that transmission solenoids rarely go bad. Usually what happens is the hydraulic circuit the solenoid applies to has a problem, which then causes the solenoid to act goofy. The car's computer sees this, then puts the car into 'limp-home mode' which is what it did to you. It limits the transmission to only 3rd gear to prevent further damage to the transmission. The leading cause of solenoids acting up is metal shavings or clutch material from inside the transmission clogging up the solenoids. In which case you have further internal transmission problems that need to be addressed. And can only be addressed by taking the transmission apart

If your transmission fluid is black, it only gets black for one of two reasons. 

**a)** the transmission has been overheated 

**b)** the transmission has hard part failure and metal/paper/rubber from the transmission internals is contaminating the transmission fluid.

Long story short. You probably needed a transmission from the beginning, but the dealership is sort of taking you for a ride. In the future if you ever have problems and your check engine light or transmission light come on, your first course of action should be to take it to Autozone or somewhere and get the car scanned for codes free of charge. Then research what your codes mean. If you have a transmission specific problem, call a transmission shop for a quote and diagnosis."

Jackets: I hate them. Mostly Wear elastic sleeves, unless its cold. If you want it to last, get leather sleeves. I like the cheap elastic sleeves for hot weather.  I mostly TIG weld though.

Gloves: I like the Tilman MIG gloves. Longer gauntlet, not too thick, not too thin. They are stitched up nicely, and the threads don't burn out too easily. For heavier MIG work, I'll sometimes wear a pair of light stick welding gloves. in that case, buy whatever. it doesn't much matter, but be aware, the higher end stuff at welding supply shops will be nicer than the stuff at harbor freight or home depot. Cost is reflective of this.

How can we possibly understand and accept each other if we refuse to acknowledge our mutual grossness? It is SO weird to me to separate that stuff. There are no gender secrets. Or there shouldn't be. I think that having specific places that allow ONLY men or ONLY women perpetuates that stuff.

(2) NUDITY: I think that people should be allowed to practice nudism. There is no real mystery to the human body--we all look pretty similar. I feel like accepting nakedness would also make it easier for people who end up getting photographed/exposed naked. People would say ""oh who cares?"" instead of ""ahghhgh fire her from the public school!""

Mahler5,whowouldwin,1389669499.0,"So basically you just need to specify what era of Dalek we're talking about. In the classic series, you saw some of the early stages, since Davros hadn't figured out how to perfect them yet. I mean, in addition to knocking them over, they were also restricted to travelling on magnetic pathways. By the 1980's (in Earth terms), they had worked out levitation, but Skaro was burnt to a crisp during a confrontation with the Doctor. and then you have the time war, which was the peak of Dalek civilization. You see in Series 1 ""Dalek,"" a Time War Dalek, which was not at peak efficiency due to it's corrupted DNA, but the Doctor seemed sure that it could wipe out entire cities if let loose. After the Time War, the Daleks, with their reduced numbers, began developing strategies of subterfuge, creating technology to take over organic bodies and implant a Dalek agenda, which would make them very dangerous in any protracted war against them, in addition to their already formidable conventional military prowess.

A single Dalek can be defeated only if you have the right weaponry to face it. An army of them is nigh unstoppable."

They can discuss internally to make my life living hell when I get back but then I'd just sit it out and get a gigantic severance package. 

There were many other reasons why I decided against it. Political ones, too but mainly because it simply doesn't work business culture wise. We have different opinions of working effectively. 

The German direct and no-nonsense approach for efficiency (which North Americans consider rude) doesn't really work well with American diplomacy and politeness (which I consider hypocrite and dishonest).

My only gripe is if you're not paying attention to moving apps to the USB storage, or watching your caches and generally clearing old files off the internal, you're dealing with ""low storage"" notifications every two seconds. 

The only thing the low internal storage has ever prevented me from doing was using Netflix. The app loads, allows you to select something to watch, and then simply doesn't stream. That said, the Hulu app works without a hitch, so I just use that. I should also mention that I watch my Coursera lectures on it just fine, as well.

m2drox,AskReddit,1389669974.0,"Not really, our natural state is to wake up for a few hours, work and eat, sleep for a few, wake up again, fuck, sleep for a few, wake up again and work, and sleep again. If we were to stop using alarms and timing when we got up, our society would be unable to function on a synchronized level as it does now, and as a result, the only real jobs we would be able to do is farm. Your instincts tell you a lot of things, again, the reason we suppress our urges is because we have moved on to better, greater things. Basically, it's a bad idea to undo thousands of years of progress and trial and error of a lot of people who have come to tell us that what we are doing now is the best version of what we as people can do. There's a reason we stopped having sex with everyone we saw, and started waking up at certain times, and doing what we do. To get out of the dark ages, we had to put away our primal urges."
Willravel,beagle,1389669984.0,"Thanks for being Petey's hero. I'll try and go one issue at a time. 

&gt;They told me that he is crate-trained and house-trained. I know there needs to be some re-training involved when you bring a dog to a new home. I tried to get him to go to his crate by using treats, putting his bed in there, and food/water bowl there. Somehow he still manages to get out of his crate whether it's locked or barricaded. I even put the crate in the living room so that he doesn't feel too alone. I also tried confining him to the kitchen but he somehow magically got over the gate.

A treat in the crate is great positive reinforcement, but it's not the only kind. When I got my beagle, I put his crate right beside my bed when I slept with the closed door facing me so he could see me. I made sure he was on clean, thick blankets, so he could stay warm and comfortable. Despite this, he was lonely the first few nights, and cried for a few hours after being put to bed. They weren't cries of needing to be changed or fed like a human infant, though, so I had to treat him differently. I had to ignore him. After those first few nights, he realized he wasn't alone and slept soundly. As time went on, his crate was a little farther away until he was in the spot I wanted him to sleep in. 

Spend time with Petey around and in the crate, make sure he recognizes that it's a safe place. 

If Petey's going to try and be an escape artist, you need to put boundaries in place, figuratively and literally. Put him in a closed crate with a locking mechanism. It's not up to him whether or not he's in the crate, it's up to you and you've made your decision. 

&gt;Petey also keeps peeing everywhere. I know urine marking can be common I just don't know how to deal with it. Sometimes he ends up peeing a lot, pretty much when I'm not around. I take him out before I leave and when I come home.

You mentioned being in an apartment? Make sure he knows the door which leads to his relief area. When he starts peeing in the house, lift him as he's peeing and carry him to where you want him to pee. Don't shame him for peeing, as that's not how dogs work and you'll just make him sad and associate nervousness with urinating. Reward him for urinating outside with praise. It's just a matter of time. 

Other things you didn't mention:

1) Beagles are, even more than most other breeds, comfortable when they're with others. My beagle hates being alone, and if I leave him alone too much he becomes depressed. The good news is this also means they're extremely affectionate and naturally friendly, terrific cuddlers. If you're out of the house 10 hours a day for work, your beagle is going to suffer. 

2) Beagles are vocal. Eventually, this can be trained away, but don't be surprised if your beagle ends up doing that half bark half howling thing beagles love to do. I found the most success with actually taking classes with my beagle, and making absolutely certain he has regular exercise so he doesn't have pent-up, nervous energy. 

3) Beagles can have medical problems. I feed my beagle like he's training for the Olympics, I walk him every day, I roll around with him, and I make certain he's always fully healthy with his vet. Basically, I've done everything humanly possible to ensure his good health. Despite this, he has an enlarged liver, has developed pancreatitis, and has bad rear knee ligaments at the age of 9. It's largely genetic. Keep an eye on hips and joints, especially. Don't feed him table scraps unless you're having plain boiled chicken for dinner. Don't let him jump up on the furniture. Be careful with stairs. If you have hardwood floors, get a lot of carpets. 

4) Beagles are incredibly popular. Taking Petey on walks practically guarantees running into other beagle owners. Make friends with them. Arrange playdates. Exchange tips and information and anecdotes. You may find you're suddenly part of a community of nice folks, and Petey might really enjoy hanging out with some of the other neighborhood beagles. "

The hard (but permanent way) is to work on your inner game. You act needy for a reason, and that's because you're not fully secure. You get your value from what other people give you, and not what you give yourself, and therefore you'll try to seek that out from people. You come off as needy when you are more invested in the girl than she is in you.

Just because we can unsubscribe from the shit, doesn't mean the people who like that shit are going to just stick to those shitty subreddits.

sexandliquor,houston,1389670922.0,"What kind of car do you have? Contrary to popular belief not every mechanic is out to swindle you. Not every mechanic is out to upsell you on things. When a mechanic recommends you get something replaced or have something looked at, a lot of times it's because things go bad and to keep the car running in tip top shop some wear-able items need to be replaced. Cars don't last forever the way they came from the factory. Things wear out and need to be replaced.

Don't want to get taken advantage of? Learn about your car and learn what certain parts are. Ignorance isn't an excuse. Pro-tip: If you don't want to get taken advantage of, ask questions, be firm about what you want to have done. Don't let yourself get upsold if it's something you don't think you need. Go somewhere else and get a second or third opinion.

Once you sign on the dotted line and authorize repairs, that's on you. No one is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to buy things. There are honest mechanics out there. Just because where you go they are trying to sell you some stuff, doesn't mean you don't need it. You very well could need it. Because admittedly you don't know anything about cars."

The_Cameraman,raisedbynarcissists,1389671745.0,"I've blocked most of that shit out of my memory, but a few are just too hilarious to forget.


1) NDad is pissed at my sister, 14 at the time, (because she said ""fuck you"" to him, but only because he tried to force feed her the dinner she didn't want to eat). She goes into her room and locks the door. What does he do? 
He fucking kicks and punches the door until it's fubar'd enough to where he can rip it off the fucking hinges and throws it to the ground. He then proceeds to scream at my sister ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID!""

She laughed.

2) NDad says to my sister (11 at the time): 'Chriss, your father is a very attractive man"" just out of the blue when we're riding in his truck one day. No conversation preceded that comment that would even begin to lead to a rational reason why he would even say that.

3) We were flying back from Nebraska. While we're waiting for the baggage, I keep telling him that our final bag had a blue ribbon, and not a green (I was 13 at the time.) He said to shut it, to keep looking for the green ribbon, and slapped me in the back of the head. As a reflex, I elbowed him in the mouth and broke off one of his caps on his front tooth. He stood there for a few seconds, looked me in the eye, and said ""I hate you. No one will ever love me again"" in his falsetto whiney voice and his cheeks/lips doing that fucking scrunching thing that they do when he's angry/distraught but wants to play the victim.

Now, this is a man that is VERY self-conscious about his dental situation. He has partials, and whenever he misplaced them, he would scream ""WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MY TEETH"". He would make my sister, brother and I look for them, all the while he's breath-snarling ""you better fucking find them"" and ""we're not leaving for school/work/sports/etc. until you give them back"". When he would (or when we would) find them in the place he left them, it's like a switch would turn off, and it'd be like nothing ever happened. So accidentally fucking up his teeth in self-defense was fucking awesome."

As for rushing the date, I know how you feel. I also like to confirm things and have my days planned well in advance, but unfortunately it doesn't work that well in dating. As a general guideline, you'll want to hold off on being definitive until the last minute (not literally).

dirtyewok,coys,1389672005.0,"People aren't writing Gylfi off because he doesn't have talent, but we have players who can play the same role better.  You talk about the VdV role with Lamela on the right and Chadli on the left, but that leaves Eriksen out of the lineup. Put Eriksen on the left and you leave Andros (who has a big upside to him) out of the lineup. Put Andros on the right and you leave Lamela out of the lineup.

Gylfi does have talent, but he is and has been a very square peg in a round hole for us.  He isn't a winger yet we keep putting him out there and trying to pretend that he is winger despite the fact that he has no pace, isn't a great defender, doesn't beat his man 1x1 and it is a waste to have fire off crosses. He just isn't effective out there.

He is suited to play behind the striker, problem is that both Eriksen and Lamela are both suited to play in the same role and carry much, much higher ceilings for what they can develop into than Gylfi.  

Like you said, Gylfi has a terrific shot that he can get off very quickly and from distance, he is good with his positioning, he isn't a bad passer. However both Eriksen and Lamela (based on watching his Roma form) are far, far more creative, better passers, better movement, better on the ball when moving in a crowd and have solid shots. They are just more rounded and skilled than Gylfi and are suited to sit behind a striker.

I think Gylfi can be a good player, i just don't know that we will ever make use of him in a way that we will ever get to see it happen while he is with us."

The other is one of the best folklore books every written... it's called Things That Go Bump In The Night by the late Robert Jones. It's a must have for local book fans. 

My personal favorite story has some apparent grain of truth to it. Back in the 60's, a few pieces of Spanish gold were found by kids exploring along the Normanskill creek between Rt 144 and Rt 9. It had apparently been washed out during the spring thaw, and was tied to a number of different tales about pirates that had come up the Hudson River during the 17th and 18th centuries. I've got an old news article about it somewhere, and to the best of my knowledge, no more has been found, so the rest of the cache is possibly still out there.

Try to take classes you feel confident you can get an A in, while still taking core classes. Try for the 4.0. They take a certain number of the top highest GPAs and that’s it, cannot stress that enough. I think the lowest last year was around 3.8, which I was surprised was that low.

Also, take COM 107 during your Spring semester. It's the only Newhouse class you can take if you're not in Newhouse, and it'll give you a lot info on whether or not you even want to be in it.

Then there are questions of ability to handle higher volume and perhaps waste reduction. Possibly even a reduction in rental space required for a storefront by more efficient layout due to fewer worker walk way and work space requirements.

I should point out that nobody has made any serious advances on me so far, but it's an issue I'd like to nip in the bud without kicking up a fuss or hurting any feelings.

I teach Debating, Critical Thinking and Oral English so in some classes I've discussed differences between the West and the East. We've discussed whether High School students should be allowed to date and how Western students typically date younger and are more liberal with sex, alcohol and drugs, so these topics haven't helped avoid the problem!

Chinese students are very interested in whether you have a boyfriend or girlfriend (it was actually the first question a student asked me when I introduced myself) so I told them I had a girlfriend. I'm still not sure if that was wise...

Also, my advice for younger teachers would definitely be to try to create the impression of a big age gap between you and your classes, especially if you're only a few years older than some of your students."

BullNiro,AskMen,1389673608.0,"Okay, so lets go through my arguments:

1. It is mutiliation. Function is impared because it cannot be jerked the way that it is with the foreskin. I am fairly certain that there is no way you can argue against the fact that you can't jerk it like you do with a foreskin without a foreskin.

2. More guys I know who use lotion are circumcised. I don't think you can really argue with this since it's a personal anecdote.

3. I go on to imply that if you can't jerk it without lotion because of a circumcision then function is impared.

Those are the three arguments I make. I don't make any other arguments other than injecting ideas which I say could be tested.

Let's look at what you have posted:

1. You argue that it's not mutilation because ""my penis works perfectly fine"". This is a shitty argument because 1. it's anecdotal evidence and 2. (and forgive me for assuming here) you probably never had an intact penis to use for all that long. You haven't provided any studies backing you up either. So I don't see evidence, and I don't see logic.

2. Because women don't have a foreskin that means their genital function is impared by my logic. Do I really have to tell you why this is a moronic argument?

After that you start irrelevant rambling about the function of the foreskin in an attempt to disprove my hypothesis, which is stupid because you need an experiment to disprove a hypothesis.

You appear to have failed at both empiricism and rationalism. Could you remind me how you have shown me that my ""logic and argument [have] absolutely no basis in fact.""?

&gt; I just signed a contract with Bantam to do a collection of my Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, which take place in Westeros a hundred years before.  We’re going to do a collection of the first four of those (three of which are already written).  The fourth one I have yet to write, and that one will appear in the anthology “Dangerous Women,” which I’m editing with gardner dozois.  And then after “Dangerous Women” it will be reprinted in this collection.  And there will be more Dunk &amp; Eggs.  Four does not tell the entire story.  **I want to take these two characters through their entire lives and that will probably require, I don’t know, eight, nine, ten, twelve novellas.**  Written over the years, I sort of slipped them in between the books so it’ll take me a while.  But, you know, that’s more Westeros material.  As to what I’m going to write after that, I really don’t know.  That’s so many years in the future…whatever I said now, I would probably change my mind whenever I reached it anyway.

Because of this I strongly feel that one should NEVER encourage someone else to commit suicide. Particularly when OP had indicated several telltale signs of legitimate mental illness (agoraphobia, most tellingly).  

A suicidal person is literally not capable of thinking rationally. They cannot be an accurate judge if their condition because their brain is not working. They cannot make the decision of whether or not to end their life because they are not of sound mind.

In the last few years, I've learned to cook and now I take leftovers to work for lunch but I also have a batch of frozen burritos I made on hand for days when I don't have leftovers.  They're in the full-size freezer.  

Mom:  What's the deal with these burritos?  Are you ever going to eat them?  
Me:  They're only for days when I don't have leftovers.  We've had plenty of leftovers lately so I haven't needed them.  Why?
Mom:  They're in the way.
Me:  There are 2 one-gallon bags of them in your full-size freezer.  Where should I put them?
Mom:  I don't know.  Why do you need them?  Can't you just eat out?

I think it comes from the desire to paint every action undertaken by the United States as sinister. Since the US = always evil, then Japan obviously was right to attack Pearl Harbour.

My favorite thing about America, is that we know that we're f'ed up. We don't have some rose tinted glasses on, and in more cases than not, we are able to identify the ill parts of society, and acknowledge that it needs to be worked upon. We do not have some misguided notion that we are perfect, and understand that we are far from it. But, the founding principles of equality and freedom, in my opinion, keeps us continuously pursuing a better version of ourselves.

Check the transmission fluid. Is it low? Does it smell burnt. If it's low, put some in it. Take it to Autozone and have it scanned for codes.

&gt; Hello author. Somehow your article has been linked to a site called r/mensrights, which has been described by the SPLC as a reactionary. anti-women hategroup. Here's the link: http://np.reddit.com/r/MensRig...

&gt; That's why there's suddenly lots of hatred and lots of comments. Sorry, hope this doesn't ruin your morning! I think your son's adorbz btw.

Looks like we are now an official hate group so I guess we have that going for us now. But back to the topic at hand. Over all I feel bad for the little dude, he's mimicking his mom and the things he is mimicking are going to become pretty problematic for him if it continues on through his adolescence into his teens and adulthood. I also find the use of mansplaining absolutely appalling its nothing more than a silencing tactic and using it to describe what her son is doing is pretty messed up considering that he is following her lead on what is sexist and wrong. Hopefully one day he will end up seeing the sexism targeting men and the way he is disadvantaged by it and I hope his mother sees it too I think it would be an eye opener for the author that's for sure. Also why does a 10 year old kid know the perceived sexual connotations of a [scene like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RP19fnff_c) If he is perceiving that as sexualized then it kind of makes me wonder, I mean at 10 I didn't have any idea what sexuality was let alone sexualization."

eighthgear,anime,1389676223.0,"Anime, to me, is simply a medium. A way of telling stories. What anime means to me, depends on what I am watching. Some anime is simply entertainment.

You know how people talk about not just reading books, but experiencing them? For me, really good anime is the same. I've always been more of an introvert, so those fictional worlds are comforting in many ways.

On the other hand, I would say that anime has not drawn me into introversion. Indeed, I've been a relative introvert for most of my life, but I only recently started watching anime. In many ways, I think that anime has helped me. I've made friends through it. I've become a bit closer to my older sister, who has been an anime fan far longer than I have, through it. And I would definitely say that anime (particularly of the shōjo/josei variety), has made me into a bit of a romantic. Well, a wannabe one. I used to think that the idea of someone being attracted to me was preposterous, despite the fact that I am firmly average looking. Watching anime, bizarrely, has caused me to take better care of my body.

AsherMaximum,Breadit,1389676720.0,"Mixing:
Going by how soft the dough feels doesn't really tell you enough. Although the softness of smoothness of a dough can give you an idea of if it is ready, you should always use [the windowpane test](http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2010/09/technique-the-windowpane-test-for-pizza-dough.html) to see if your dough has fully developed the gluten. This test is probably one, if not the, most important part of kneading.

Rise time:
""As long as possible"" is not really a good idea at all. Most dough needs to double during the bulk rise; if it is different than that, the recipe will say. Even if the recipe lists a time for the first rise, always go by volume, not time. If the recipe does not say how much the dough should increase in size, you can safely assume it should double.  
Temperature will change the time greatly. I'm not sure where I read this, but it doesn't take a lot of temperature change to **double** or **halve** the rising time; I believe it is only a 9 degree change.

For proofing (rising in the pan/formed into loaves), it is also about double. If your loaves are falling during baking, you have proofed them too much. 

You should also be getting a fair amount of oven spring (rising in the oven). This happens in the first 10 minutes or less of baking. To help get a lot of oven spring, you need to control two things: the amount of heat the loaf is absorbing (you want it to be a lot, and quickly), and the amount of crisping in the first ten minutes of baking (you want it to be little to none; crisping stops the dough from expanding).  

To help with heating the dough quickly, use a pizza or other baking stone. Put it on the rack you will be placing the loaves on, and put it in when you set the oven to preheat. Try to make sure your stone is big enough to fit the loaves on without them hanging off.  
The stone will quickly transfer heat to the loaves, making them quickly expand. 

To stop the loaves from crisping on the top, there are two things you need to do. First, control the heat the top of the loaf is getting. Most ovens have an element on the top; if this turns on, it can crisp the loaves much quicker.  
To prevent this, preheat your oven 50 degrees above what the recipe calls for, and lower the temperature right before you put the loaves in. This will stop the oven from turning on because of the heat loss of opening the door. It also helps that the oven is right at the temperature you want it, instead of 30+ degrees below.  

The second thing that helps prevent crisping is steam; TONS of steam. There are many methods people use to get steam into the first minutes of baking, but here is what I do:

 * Place a pan of water on the lower rack of the oven when you set it to preheat.
 * After you put the loaves in, spray the oven walls with water from a spray bottle set to a fine stream. I usually do ~8 sprays on each side wall. (Watch the oven light, ig you hit it with water it could crack. Same goes for the pizza stone)
 * Repeat the spraying twice more, waiting 30 seconds between each.

As for the type of fat, I do not know how the different kinds could effect your bread. I use butter in all my bread, with great results.
I follow [this recipe](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/22464/white-sandwich-loaf), increasing the butter to 15g. I find the extra butter really helps to keep the bread from going stale or moldy as quickly.


Also, I would recommend not using the stand mixer until you have been consistently turning out good loaves that you are happy with for a while. Kneading the dough by hand lets you feels the changes the dough goes through as it develops, and after a while, you can easily tell how developed your dough is just by pressing it between your fingers or stretching it.

The ratio is about 1:1.33 instant:active. So, if a recipe calls for 3g of instant dry yeast, you would need 4g of active dry yeast to do the same thing.

**AND DON'T YOU DARE TRY TO COMPARE ME TO THOSE RED PILL PIECES OF SHIT WHO BLAME THE VICTIMS OF RAPE**
 
I think that government regulations and frivolous lawsuits have made it impossible for the industry to evolve. Companies don't want bad press, they don't want to kill people, they don't want to lose profits. They are people too, and they are just trying to make a living and survive in this world like the rest of us.
 
Yes, I do blame stupid people for killing themselves. I blame the guy who got drunk and pissed on an electrical generator for killing himself. I blame the idiots who jump the fences by large cliffs for falling off. I blame people who are stupid for getting themselves killed by not paying attention to what they're doing. Is it sad? Yes. It is unfortunate that people can die for doing stupid shit, but it is not the fault of the company for just trying to use some flashy advertising to get some more customers. We learn from our mistakes, and if this company advertising their product in a similar fashion to energy drinks has caused a death, one of two things can happen.
 
1. We can create regulations and sue the company for its mistake. Ruin the lives of plenty of the members of this company for a mistake that is not even entirely their fault, and allow people to remain blissfully ignorant of their surroundings and their actions.
 
OR
 
2. We can allow this to go public and have people become aware of what they are drinking, take some personal responsibility (it WAS labeled properly, just misleading in it's color scheme and wording) *and* let the company step in to take some responsibility of its own. The company may take note of what has happened and feel awful for killing someone AS NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS WOULD and then they would pull the advertising and apologize. They would fix their mistake so that they can actually make a profit. Thus future companies would learn from the death, people wouldn't drink something without knowing for sure what they're drinking, and the Earth would keep on spinning. Life goes on.
 
 
Look, I'm not saying that regulations or lawsuits don't originally have good intentions. But they just don't work all the way through, and they infringe on the freedoms of many other people. Pay attention to what you're doing, don't drink unknown things. I feel this way about Coca-Cola too! People should be aware that sodas such as Pepsi and Coke corrode your teeth. You would be surprised how many people don't. But does that mean we should sue the pants off of these companies for making something that everyone wants? No, people should just pay attention to what they're consuming. Yes, this is a philosophical debate. But I would rather be free and not get sued, have some people get hurt or killed in the process, than allow people to make money off of the misperceptions of others and allow an overbearing power to control our lives.
 
Let me tell you a story. A true story. I know a man, a close friend of mine, and one of his closest friends was a well-respected surgeon. This surgeon was a good man who poured his heart and soul into helping others. One day a woman is rushed into the emergency room after suffering a spinal injury in a car accident. There is no one there to give permission to operate on her and sign release forms, but if this surgeon doesn't operate immediately she will die. Putting the bureaucratic crap aside, he operates on her and saves her life. During the procedure, he accidentally inflicts minor damage that makes her recovery take a little longer. But he has saved her life. Two weeks later he is being sued for medical malpractice. In the courtroom, before the judge delivered the guilty verdict, the surgeon asked, ""If I had just let her die, I wouldn't be losing my practice and all of the money I have earned for my family?"" The judge nodded solemnly and banged his gavel. The woman, who would not be alive without this surgeon, leaves smiling with millions of dollars coming her way. The surgeon, who saved this woman's life, leaves crying with his family who now have no way of paying their bills.
 
*This is a true story.* And though it may not serve this particular debate perfectly, it goes to show that these lawsuits ruin more lives than they save. What I'm trying to say is that people need to learn not to rely on the government to hand them everything and punish everyone, especially because people make mistakes. If the mistake is bad enough, the pack mentality that people used to have will punish the company in sales and eventually drive them out if they refuse to change. People used to avoid buying bad products before the government started telling everyone what to think and what is safe.

Because of precopulatory sexual selection.

&gt;Take gorillas, very small testicles, they don't mate very often. Chimps, huge testicles, they fuck constantly. 

They have large testicles because of sperm competition. This has no relevance to our argument though. Whereas my linking you those papers were for you to understand what effects penis size on an evolutionary scale. Which you were wrong about.

&gt;No, because they exist to promote an agenda. 

You have given yourself away here. They are pure science, no agenda promoting. This suggests that you are the one with the agenda.

&gt;Only some independent readings. 

I guess it was a generous question to ask.

&gt;But this has nothing to do with biology, or evolution. 

But it does, you have been trying to argue with me about the function of various pieces of genital anatomy and are totally wrong.

&gt;This has to do with I like me dick just the way it is and that precludes it from being mutilated. 

It doesn't. This is why this is sad. You will never know what it's like to have an intact penis. You won't know what you're missing. You are trying to convince me but are unwilling to change your mind, this is why your arguments are so shit logically and empirically. You have no evidence and you can't see why your reasoning sucks because you had the conclusion and are looking for ways to rationalise it. Read it, think about it.

Also, your recipe uses whole wheat. Whole wheat bread is very, very hard to get light and fluffy. I have no experience with it, so I couldn't tell you what to do differently with it, but maybe someone else can.

I had the same issue with bread being too dense, and I was already measuring by weight. I think the issue was the flour I was adding during kneading. People new to breadmaking seem to add a lot of flour during kneading, thinking the dough is too sticky.  
I fixed this by making the recipe once, using the exact amounts called for by weight, and not adding any flour during kneading, even when the dough felt too sticky. Now, after doing that once, I know how to add the right amount during kneading without adding too much."

apocryphite,Psychonaut,1389679010.0,"Interesting question. Thanks for posting.

I think that your idea is somewhat healthy. Sitting around being happy is nice and well, but in the greater scheme of things it also seems a bit.. pointless, after a while.

I like to think of human society as an organism, like we as humans are composed of hundreds of billions of cells.

Now, I would like all of my cells to be happy and healthy. If a single cell is happy and healthy, that is nice, but I would like it even more if that cell used its health and vitality to help other cells heal. 

A cell sacrificing its own health and wellbeing for the greater good is a paradox. If everybody works themselves into unhappiness in service of others, everyone is unhappy. But work itself doesn't cause unhappiness, only overwork. Just stay conscious of your own happiness also.

I find that cultivating your own happiness is not merely an egoistic endeavour, but an act of greater compassion towards the rest of life, because achieving this creates a solid foundation for doing work to help others. It is a natural and healthy instinct in most humans. Balanced individuals can't take sitting on a couch doing nothing for very long.

To answer your bolded question: I think that happiness is important, and should be strived for. At some point, you are happy enough that working for others is a lot more efficient than working for yourself. I think that you should act on your instinct to do good work :)"

For a little bit of perspective, I have been off the market for three years now, but I still have coffee or lunch/dinner hang outs pretty regularly because its a nice way to chat with friends. On my end, I am genuinely wary of doing this with guys I've just met because I don't know whether my friendliness will be misinterpreted. 

In addition to the increased confidence/less social awkwardness (which I definitely agree with), it may be that these women are simply more comfortable trying to be friendly because *you* are off the market and they think they don't have to worry as much about being misinterpreted.

HelenAngel,AskWomen,1389680256.0,"I've basically given up at this point. I just accept that I am a terrible judge at gauging what I look like. When you find the right person, they will think you are the most beautiful person in the world because they will love you for you. You just have to believe that and believe in yourself. A large part of attractiveness has nothing to do with your physical appearance and everything to do with how you carry yourself and how you present yourself to others. I know I'm not a supermodel- far from it. On my best day, I'm maybe mediocre at best. But other people seem to think I'm attractive because I try to be kind to everyone, always smile, and at least look like I make some effort to care for myself.


On days when I feel terrible about myself, I usually just throw myself into doing something to help other people. I volunteer for lots of different things and I try to always keep myself occupied with something that will help someone else. I feel terrible about myself a lot but hey, at least I'm doing something productive with all that negative energy!"

Did you read my earlier comment?  *""Those don't have realistic applicable use in self defense situations seeing as how they essentially guarantee collateral damage. Small calibur arms i.e handguns, shotguns, rifles do and can be used safely in self defense situations without major (or any) collateral damage.""*

Landmines and grenade launchers fall into this category.  Who cares what infantry use.  I only care about what I can use safely without posing an inherent danger to people or property.  Explosive don't fit that category but small caliber firearms do

Avistew,polyamory,1389680953.0,"I think it's good that you've let her know you're there to talk if she wants it, but in my opinion, you should stay out of it if she doesn't end up taking up your offer. A metamour's relationship is a bit like a sibling's relationship: you want it to go well, but it's not really your place to go talk to your brother's girlfriend after he's cheated on her.

Now, being there for her is great, of course, but I think she needs to breathe and recover first. Then when you explain the situation to her, I don't think there is a magical resource that will help. Quite honestly, I find most resources on polyamory either preachy or having nothing to do with polyamory as I live it. And it could seem a bit condescending if you start sounding like you're trying to ""educate""  her or something.

So, leave it personal. Answer questions about your specific situations. Sure, you can say it's called polyamory if she's curious about that, but chances are she doesn't really care. She probably just wants to know how long her boyfriend has been with your wife, if there is any chance of a future with him, etc.

You can let her know that you are mono as well, that would be good if she wants to ask about specific mono things, but be careful not to make it sound like just because you're mono, her situation and yours are the same. You're not the spokesperson of monogamy, after all, and chances are she works differently, so be careful not to present your personal experiences as solutions for her situation, because they might end up completely irrelevant.

And then... let her decide where she stands. She should have been given that choice from the get go, and it's harder now, but she should definitely have it. And I think that if she decides to break it off, her boyfriend owes it to her to respect her decision, and take it as a lesson to be honest in the future."

Avistew,polyamory,1389681477.0,"You might be experiencing a form of NRE. New Relationship Energy is that ""shiny new toy"" feeling people can have, and experiencing it might emphasize the fact that this part of your relationship with your primary has faded away.

Has it been replaced with ERI? Established Relationship Intimacy is that feeling that you know your partner, that you can rely on them. It's made up of the memories you have together, the private jokes you have, the ways you can finish each other's sentences or know ""that look"" and so on.

It's quite possible you were in a relationship that didn't work for you without knowing it because you've never experienced anything else. On the other hand, it's also likely you're just comparing someone's best of to someone else's outtakes.

What I mean is, if you're in a new relationship, not only is a new partner on their best behaviour, but you're also seeing them through lenses. Even things that might really annoy you after a few months or year can be endearing to you, or at worst you just don't notice them. So you often only think of a new partner as their ""best of"". You brush aside negatives, and you don't know them well enough to know much about the negatives.

A long-term partner, however, you know better. And chances are after a while together, you've had downs as well as ups. When comparing with the new partner, your mind is likely to think about all the negative things about your established partner, and not think of the positive because you take them for granted. As a result, you're really only thinking of their outtakes, the things that went wrong.

So, try and clear your mind as much as you can and to think as objectively as you can. Think about when your relationship started with your established partner. Think about the good things along the years. Ask yourself if you were miserable that whole time and didn't want to admit it, or if you're just confused.

And hopefully you'll get your answer. Just beware of NRE addiction (when people only stay with their partners until the NRE fades out, and then get new ones. Happens also in monogamy, known as serial monogamy. The main difference in polyamory is that relationships tend to overlap instead of quickly following one another)."

BullNiro,AskMen,1389681895.0,"It must be hard to be so out of your depth so I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you don't know how wrong what you are saying is.

The function of the penis is not the function of the foreskin. They are two different things (that's why we use different words for each). Until you accept this you cannot understand any of my arguments.

Furthermore I have provided a lot of evidence by now. Four papers which broadly back up the points I have been making over the past few comments — two for loss of function and two to show that you don't know the you are talking about.

I have not made the argument you are accusing me of making. I have simply said that circumcision is mutilation because of loss of function due to foreskin loss and a loss of associated function. I am not sure what your problem is other than being a defensive guy who doesn't like the idea that his penis has not been improved upon (unless you have the genes of a premature ejaculator) by circumcision.

It's sad guy, you could learn from me but instead of rebutting my arguments you just shout about how *I* have ""failed"" at logic. My reasoning is fairly sound. And I don't care what others think of my penis. Where does your insecurity come from?"

Secret_Wizard,AskReddit,1389682102.0,"Hands down *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*. The story of its main questline is on a whole 'nother level than anything from the rest of the Elder Scrolls series.

To sum it up very, very simply, it turns out you're pretty much the prophesied anti-christ figure of the local religion. A nation that already looked upon you unfavorably for simply being a foreigner now actively despises you... But the thing is, you're the only one that can save them from a greater evil brewing within Red Mountain. Over the course of the story you pretty much march straight up to the faces of every political and religious leader on the island, including one of the three mortal Gods worshiped by the people, and slap sense into 'em to gain their trust and support.

Even the heretic Ashlanders who were supposed to support the Nerevarine (that's you) are against you, because you were supposed to be a native-born dark elf and not an outlander of some other race. The story just gets so crazy and intricate, and you can really just drink in this complex backstory and lore of a fictional race. The dialogues with Vivec (the aforementioned God) can last for like half an hour as you discuss the moral conflicts and plight of the land with him.

* They were forced to close the secret door so that Smaug wouldn't spot them, which meant the only way out was through Smaug's lair
* Unbeknownst to them, Smaug headed for Laketown to seek his revenge
* Bilbo didn't pick up the Arkenstone until later, when all the dwarves were searching through the treasure too

notlindseydalton,infj,1389682553.0,"Dad: ESTJ

Mom: ISFJ

(same as the OPs parents)

Sister: ENFP? 

I get along with my parents and they truly respect me, but I also find it impossible to communicate with either of my parents. As is frequently the case with fathers, my dad rarely takes active interest in my life. He's loving in a way that doesn't really involve asking prying questions, which I appreciate because I know he wouldn't understand, and we share the same sense of humor and an appreciation for the outdoors, so I am more comfortable just hanging out with my dad watching TV or hiking.

My mom has a very prying way about her; she's introverted in that she likes to be a wallflower around people she doesn't know but it seems that she never needs a minute alone from her family. She has this deep love for me so she is always asking questions and doesn't understand my answers but keeps asking anyway. And when I'm honest, she always tells me ""I'm being too hard on myself"" or that I shouldn't worry about things because it'll all work out. These responses really irk me because they completely dismiss why I'd be upset about something.

My sister and I are two years apart and never got along growing up, I have a very independent nature and she is very dependent (usually on me) and I hated it. Every time I liked something, she liked it. I have always worked to figure out who I was and think about everything before I do it and she seemed like she blindly followed me, which I never respected. Plus I was a bit resentful that she, being the younger sibling, had it much easier with my parents cause they were already confused by me and learned not to question her on things, which made her act an entitled and spoiled child.

I'm legitimately jealous of those with N parents. It really felt like a losing battle trying to explain my motives and inner thoughts to my parents. And since I always consciously or unconsciously seek their approval, it has been hard growing up with them. I don't take them for granted though, they have literally given me everything and for that, I'll never be grateful enough. I just wish we'd just understand each other more often.

Bit of a rant, oops.

TL;DR: Parents love me and respect me, don't understand me. Sister and I don't get along.

xlightbrightx,yoga,1389682838.0,"Another instructor to add my two cents! I teach at LA Fitness and make 20 dollars a class after completing a 200-hour Yoga Alliance certified training. :) Best part about LA Fitness is that I'm on their schedules at multiple gyms a good amount of times a week, about 7 usually. I teach at a rock climbing gym at the same rate, and the yoga studio I've taught at had a sliding scale from 10-20 dollars per class depending on class size. Free memberships at LA Fitness and a really awesome Rock Climbing gym... great perks I never expected! That's about 100 dollars a month just in free memberships that I actually use. Expect to give up a lot of night activities and weekend activities! My busiest day is Saturday, and I start teaching at 8:15am, so no partying on Friday night. I teach again at 11am and again at 5:30pm. The rest of the week I only teach night classes, Wednesdays I teach two back-to-back. I'm only teaching a total of 9 classes a week for the moment, but I can tell you it takes a lot out of you to have even that many on your schedule. Yoga pays about half of my bills, the other half I get by a house-cleaning/caretaking gig, but I definitely have an unusual schedule. I still get Sundays and Fridays off unless I pick up classes to sub. Expect a lot of driving around if you want to make a living off of yoga, since you'll need employment multiple places (unless you're planning on starting a studio).

Learjet45dream,AskReddit,1389683055.0,"Moved to Tallahassee from Denver when I was 9. After a year in public school, I switched to private school for 5th-8th grades. This was a very tiny private school. Small enough that when I started there in 5th grade, 4th and 5th grades were actually combined into one class. There was a girl that had been at the school for a long time (the school was Pre K-8th, although I don't know if she started there in Pre-K or not).

This was the kind of small school where there's only one class for each grade (except for Pre-K) and people that stayed there beyond Pre-K thus ended up in the same classes with everyone as long as they were there. It was a big deal when this girl, from here on out referred to as Q (it doesn't get the appreciation it deserves as a letter), ends up moving away to Georgia or something. I didn't really know her so no big deal to me.

Fast forward to junior year of high school. I've moved back to Colorado, same neighborhood I lived in before, going to the same high school I would have gone to had I never moved. There's a girl in my English class with the same name as Q. Turns out she had lived in Tallahassee when she was younger too. Ask if she went to the same private school I went to. Holy shit, she did. As it would turn out, she went there when she was much younger, around 1st grade. Not the same girl that I knew from 5th grade.

**tl;dr**: Move to FL, go to tiny ass private school, move back to CO, meet a girl that went to the same tiny ass private school at a different time than I did when I lived in FL."

messymistaeks,AskMen,1389683382.0,"Hey, fellow Indian-American here. I'm currently trying to get over the same feelings, maybe they'll work for you as well. I still have my flaws, but here's my story.

This map was kind of a wake-up call for me. [India is one of the most racially intolerant countries in the world.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/) I realized that one of the reasons I hated my culture was because it was so full of hatred itself; and that I was only perpetuating the problem by isolating and hiding my heritage. I began to think that the only way to *really* not be Indian was to reject race-based measurements of worth, and I also noticed that one of the qualities I admired most in people of other races was their merit-based system of worth. True rebellion against the Indian culture, it seemed, was not achieved by imitating the racist attitudes we are frequently attributed, but rather by rejecting them for a more accepting mindset.

My motives for exploring meritocratic ideals weren't healthy- I was acting out of a desire to rebel against the people and places that made me *me*, but ironically enough, it does seem to have led to a solution. 

Last summer, I jumped at the chance to escape from my ""repulsive"" parents, and traveled out-of-state on my own for the first time, to a predominantly white region. Having grown up what local kids nicknamed ""Asia away from Asia"", the residence of most Silicon Valley engineers, I was shocked at the cultural change. 

I was a minority in the new state, often the only ""brown"" person in lecture halls of hundreds. After gaping for a bit, I realized *that was the only thing that was different about me.*

Lots of people wanted money, high-paying jobs, and a great salary. Most of them wanted a stable family, and all of their parents hoped they would settle down with ""a nice girl"" and not mess around. Tons of their parents hated homosexuals, and the racist implications of their parents (or grandparents) generation frequently still lingered with them.  Their parents, just like mine,  wanted them to listen to them, to be good, to be rich, to be hard-working. 

Some of them were short; some had high-pitched voices; and most that I talked to had never dated anyone. Some were Republicans; in fact, the most popular kid there had been attending ultra-conservative rallies since he was seven, giving speeches and helping campaign for causes like ""Global warming doesn't exist!"" or ""Gay marriage is unnatural!"" or ""Islam is too violent to be legal!"" *and he was white.*

It's not just Indians. Knowing that, and seeing it for myself, made me much more open, more confident in who I was. My situation is probably not the same as yours, but three days after I heard about (let's call the aforementioned popular kid X) X's story, I Skyped my parents and realized I missed them; I had my first kiss, and was offered sex and a relationship; I found a group of friends. 

I'm not a guy (I just noticed that, sorry... downvote if you'd like.), and I usually lurk, but this hit home for me. Sorry about the uber-long story/response.

**TL;DR, tons of people experience it, you aren't alone, don't let the stereotypes get to you and realize they're not unique to your race, realize that people of all races can be flawed but they can also do great things, and so can you.**"

It doesn't have to be dramatic, and you should never feel guilty about being able to say ""These are my needs and they aren't being met. Something needs to change, and in this case, if you aren't a part of the solution then you are a part of the problem."""

If humanity as a whole is a part of nature, and every human action is the process of evolution as you said, then the human action of preserving species- for whatever reason- would fall under that 'process of evolution' umbrella.

Our sensitivity, or our unwillingness to let a unique species die, or our profit-driven motivations, or **whatever** reason we have for consciously intervening to maintain a specie's existence is, by your logic, a 'natural' occurrence.

None of those moments in the first episode of season 3 ep 1, by moments I mean his explanations or others explanations, were actually proven. Maybe CAM knew something about Mortiarty and Sherlock, so they devised this plan together, because CAM was trying to be the most powerful man in England while Moriarty was trying as well. Sherlock needs a Moriarty. Also, do we even know that the bullets in the gun were real or was he firing blanks? All I know is, is that Sherlock is always 10 steps ahead of everyone, so he forsaw this as a possibility. 

Or maybe this was just a way for him to come back, and it was his brothers plan all along. I hope its Moriarty because my two favorite villains in Sherlock were Moriarty and CAM but CAM is dead, and Sherlock needs a Moriarty or the game wouldn't be as great. "

I haven't heard of any studies that have been done, but there are absolutely theories as to what new senses might feel like.

Based on what I know, I think it'll be up to us to decide what new senses feel like.  And it depends on our level of technology, too.  Early new senses have already been developed and implemented - people have put neodymium magnets under their skin to be able to *feel* magnetic and electromagnetic fields.  This takes a force, magnetism, and sends it to the brain via regular, already existing nerves/senses.  

A next step might  be using other senses in our skin - like heat, cold, different *kinds* of pressure - and using those senses to get info to our brains.  Something like, stick out your arm and turn in a circle, when your hand feels warmest that's north

Eventually we'll be able to skip existing pathways and plug directly into the brain.  And from that point on...it could feel like anything, even things beyond our most extreme comprehension - it's up to whoever programs the senses :)"

I never thought much of it since I grew up and went to school in a relatively well-off area (middle-class, suburbs, etc.). One day a student came in, dropped off a backpack, and it prompted me to ask about them. To distill a 10 minute conversation into a line or two: he kept backpacks, freshly stocked with pencils, paper, and binders, as well as non-perishable food items and water for students who were either homeless or came from a home where they couldn't afford them. 

When I asked him why, besides being an extremely kindhearted man, he went to such lengths (he did -- still does -- all of this out of his own pocket), he said that his parents set the example for him when he was a child. He understood that he was fortunate growing up and knew, even as a child, that he had the responsibility to help others. 

On behalf of everyone, thank you for setting the same example for your son; I'm sure that when asked years from now he, too, will give the credit to his parents for raising him right."

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1389685847.0,"Yeah, I think we are in agreement, we just draw the line at different spots as to where we start/stop considering something a worthwhile character. 

""People don't even remember their name"" is something I consider a useful shorthand/litmus test because to me that shows that their gamble didn't pay off even within their own target audience (of course it's not perfect, it's for example easy to influence it heavily by naming your game after your protag, like Alan Wake for example). 

So following this shorthand/test, the fact that when you say Niko Bellic people think GTA and when people say GTA Niko Bellic will come up probably at some point shows that he at least managed to be iconic on some level, regardless of whether people liked him or whether he's actually a good character. So for me, it'd be charitable and he would get a ""pass"" based on this particular litmus test.

I think it would be one thing if this was the only pulp piece in the world to have two (bisexual?) femme fatales out for their employer's career/life, but there are plenty more--in fact, it's a hallmark of the genre--that do. Even if the reader distinguishes between fact and fiction, the stereotypes are still there, and judging from the illustration style, the book was written at a time when the fear of women coming in and taking men's jobs was very real. The implied bisexuality makes them even more terrifying (at the time).

It's not so much the fact that the women have claws under their fingernails as it is the fact that the story probably doesn't consider the women's point of view at all. They're not given a chance to explain their ambition or why they're targeting the protagonist (other than maybe a confession near the end). The characters exist for titillation and entertainment only, not to provide some insight into the human psyche.

To make it on the cheap I would suggest foam, which you can buy in groups of 6 (gold's gym floor mats in particular are strong while still being cheap) for 20 bucks at walmart.  you will also need a dremel and a heat gun for making republic trooper armor, the dremel will allows you to sand down rough edges from cutting and the heat gun will give you the smooth curves in star wars armor.  Tutorials on how to use these can also be found on the sites listed.  The armor should take at minimum 3 months for a beginner to make.

As an addition (and piece of handy advice to save you some headache) rather than make small, nitpicky pieces (or pieces which have to fit flush against larger pieces) out of foam, buy some craft foamies for a few bucks at michael's or walmart or whatever.  They'll save you a lot of headache on small details."

edisraw1,WritingPrompts,1389686412.0,"The boat drifted from the island as Kyle and Gina began their trip back to the main land. Kyles mouth was dry and he thought his wife must've felt the same so he let go of her hand that he had clung to like a branch on the tree of life since they had found their salvation in the old boat and went to grab the water he supplied for the trip.

""Shit."" 

""Whats wrong, hun?""

""I left the water back on the island.""

""Don't worry, I'll go grab it.""

""Nah, Baby we'll be back home soon enough.""

""No, It'll just take a second.""

Gina dived into the water and began to swim back to the island as Kyle searched for the anchor. As he picked it up a wave came like he had never seen before, it split down the middle at it's crest and sent the anchor flying off the boat which was now 100's of yards away from the island which the wave had hurled his wife to.

""Kyle!""

""I'm coming!""

""No! You have to go!""

""What!?""

""You have to go! I'll be fine.""

""No, that's crazy!""

""I have plenty of water! Everything is beautiful!""

""Gina, You can't stay there.""

""Kyle, someone has to watch Landon! Any way you know what will happen if you come back here.""

""I do not...You know I always hated that name?""

She snickered

""I know. Just let go and keep going you have to go. You know what will happen if you don't.""

""Let go?""

Kyle looked down and realized Gina's hand still rested in his and he looked back towards her. She now was back on the boat and looked him did in the eyes.

""If you don't let go nothing will be okay.""

""Alright.""

He dropped her hand and she floated back towards the island.

""I love you, hun. You have to go.""

The boat shook violently.

""You have to go! You have to go!""

The sun slowly began fading into florescent lights and Gina's voice began to morph to a softer, younger coo.

""Mr. Mason, you have to go.""

Kyle Mason opened his eyes to see his wives lifeless body and the small young Dr. C who had taken care of Gina on her final days. He wanted to be depressed but it was the most serene she had seemed in long while. And he still had to shake the cob webs from his recently stirred mind.

""I'm sorry Dr. C.""

""Hey, it's not a big deal. It's just been a few hours and...it's just time to say goodbye.""

""Yea.""

Kyle kissed his wife on the forehead.

""Bye, angel.""

He shook the hand of Dr. C.

""You were a real help at the end there.""

""Well she was an easy one to take care of.""

""Thank you.""

As Kyle left the hospital and walked towards his car he couldn't shake the feeling that his life was now different forever. It was a feeling he hadn't felt since his son Landon was born.

He thought to himself, ""Landon, I've always hated that name.""

Driving down the country road towards his old Victorian home, Gina picked out so many years ago his game plan to break the news to his son racked his brain. Before he could come up with a solid plan he was in front of his door turning the key. He entered his home to see the babysitter Karen sitting on the couch watching the weight loss reality show she called entertainment. Kyle had always been partial to Karen as his sons keeper but never quite understood her as a person.

""Hi, Mr. Mason. Is Mrs. Mason doing okay?""

He contemplated the situation.

""Yea, she seems really good today.""

Kyle was not proud of himself.

""Oh my god, that is great! Are you going to need me tomorrow, then?""

""Same time, same place."" He said with an aimless smirk. He took 25 dollars out of his wallet and gave it to her.

""Thanks, Mr. M. LJ's been asleep for about an hour. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

""Yea of course. Thanks for staying late.""

Karen walked towards the door. As Kyle fretted over the guilty conscious he bore for not being able to acknowledge his wives death.

""Karen.""

""Yea?""

""Really thanks for staying late...""

He handed her another 25 dollars.

""You earned that.""

""Wow, thanks, Mr. M. Are you sure. I mean it is isn't a big deal.""

""I insist...I'll see you tomorrow.""

""Okay, cool.""

Karen left. Kyle sat down and finished watching the horrible reality TV show. He was not very proud of himself. He walked to the kitchen and rifled through the fridge. He would have himself a coke...no something stronger. There was only only Gina's Kedem Kal it had sat at three quarters full since she had a headache all those nights ago. It would have to do. He poured himself a drink.

""Dad.""

""Jesus, LJ!""

""Sorry.""

""Don't worry, bud. You just startled me.""

""Yea, I could tell. Is that moms wine?""

Landon James Mason was an intuitive 12 year old, much like his mother was at that young age. He always had a question and more importantly always demanded an answer. He shared his mothers green eyes and strawberry blonde hair. Kyle suspected he would grow out of the latter.

""It is. I figured I should drink some. I don't know how long your mom is going to be in the hospital. I don't want it to go bad.""

""Wine can go bad?""

""Dammit."" Kyle thought. ""Yes."" He said.

""I never knew that.""

""How is mom doing?""

""She's fine.""

""What did you guys talk about?""

If Kyle had any power in the world for that split second he would be certain to choose the power to make ""She's fine."" an acceptable answer again, instead he was forced to stumble over his thoughts until something of meaning came upon him.

""Not much."", he said. ""Dammit."", he thought.

""Oh...well is she getting better?""

""She looked happier than she has in weeks.""

""So she is getting better.""

A spoon could cut the tension the question created. It was time for the moment of truth.

""It's looking that way, bud.""

""Do you know when she is getting out?""

""Not so much. Did you need anything? Are you thirsty or something?""

""No, I just heard you down here and I wanted to see how everything was going.""

""Oh. Well....did you want to try some wine?""

""Not really.""

""Yea. That's probably a good thing. LJ, it's late we probably should both get back to bed.""

""Okay.""

Kyle poured almost the whole glass of wine in the sink and They walked up the stairs together.

""Dad?""

""Yea?""

""Who named me?""

""Me and your mother did. See your mother liked the name Landon and I liked the name James and L comes before J in the alphabet so we figured we should just sequence it like that.""

""I always kinda hated the name.""

""That is why we call you LJ.""

""You could just call me Landon.""

""What?""

""Yea, Im not a med-evil king. I don't see why the J is so important.""

""Yea. Me either...Good night.""

""Good night, dad.""

Kyle closed his bedroom door and began watching television. Soon he realized he was just sitting with a television on. He picked up the phone.

""Kelly? What? Sorry, I meant, Karen. I don't mean to call you this late but I don't need you to come in tomorrow.... No you are doing fine, just the hospital called and Mrs. Mason passed away a little while ago.... No, No, No I don't have to go in I'll just take care of everything after the weekend...yea....yea...thank you...okay...sorry again, I'll see you sometime next week alright? Okay see you then.""

Their was no answer but the whimper didn't cease. He opened the door.

In fact I never seen her like that again. And one day I just stopped doing things and said ""Is there anything I can do?"" and she said ""Help me let go of everything wrong with this.""... and I had no idea what she meant by that.""

""What did you do then?""

""I told her ""okay."" and I gave her a kiss and I picked you up out of your crib and I put you in your stroller and I took her by the hand and we went to the beach that her parents got married at over in Cape May. We didn't say a word the whole drive there, you just slept. And we sat a gazebo that looked a lot like the one they got married at and I said ""Is this helping?"" and she said ""It will."" and we just sat there until you pooped your pants.""

""You sat there until I pooped my pants?""

""Yea in the middle of my plan I had forgotten diapers so I had to find A bathroom in some pizza place and get napkins to clean you up with and take my Steelers skully and make a little half diaper for you. And you laughed and she laughed and that's the part I remember the most. So I drove 3 hours looked an hour to find a gazebo with a perfect view of the ocean to recreate the best moment of her fathers life. And all it took was you to laugh once at me being a dummy to make her smile.""

""And she was okay?""

""As okay as she could be. It just takes time. You know?""

""Yea.""

""But like I said I'm going to be here and you can't worry about dying or me dying or anything like that. You just can't because your mom never wanted that. She'll understand if you take a day or a century to get over her but you have to keep living and smiling and doing everything that you did while she was alive. You don;t have to do it tomorrow no one is going to be mad but eventually you need to go on, for her.""

Deezl-Vegas,changemyview,1389686650.0,"Hey! I've played Dota and Starcraft 2 for a long time and I've written for sites like TL and for ROOT Gaming. It sounds like you don't enjoy League from the perspective of a classical gamer that enjoys total control and freedom in games. These are desirable traits, but many modern games, like Gears of War, are starting to sacrifice them for aesthetic, and these games are fun too. League strikes a balance between hardcore and casual that hasn't been accomplished since Smash Bros. Melee, in my opinion. It keeps a lighthearted atmosphere, but it can be very suspenseful. League is more fun than either of the other comparable games, and it's widely considered the most fun MOBA and RTS ever, beating out Dota2 and trouncing would-be competitors like SMITE and Bloodlines: Champions. You know the results of the popularity contest already; League and Dota2 have won it. 

So what makes League a ""good"" game? Well, I guess that depends on how you define good, but:

*It's more fun than most other MOBAs in the eyes of pretty much everyone.
*There is a lot of strategy, and there are many difficult choices to make. Mechanics are also very important, but they aren't defining.
*The game generates many suspenseful encounters and rewards taking calculated risks at all skill levels.
*Teams are generally balanced, and the matchmaking is very good.
*You can jump on the LCS Hype Train at any time. Choo choo!

And some flaws:

*Questionable semi-silly design choices.
*Backstory is complete ass -- basically, there are a bunch of random regions that generate superheros that fight spectacle battles to settle international disputes. What?
*No single player. Bots games are also ass (true of every RTS/MOBA ever)
*Occasionally boring characters. A lot of the beginner characters were designed to be super noob-friendly, like Gangplank, Soraka and Amumu.
*Meh graphics.
*Design choices based on playability rather than maximizing your character to the highest degree.

Control-wise, League has a very basic and intuitive button scheme, so I'm not sure what's going on with your fancy mouse there, but it might just be you.

Those are all fine and good, but what really makes a game fun? Well, it comes down to the players being often cast into suspenseful, exciting situations where their choices matter and they are rewarded for making good ones. League does this masterfully. It's very rare that players are put in a situation where they are not directly competing against other players, even if it's just for lane creeps. In contrast, Dota players often find themselves sitting at a tower or trying to time out jungle camps for pulls -- impactful, but un-fun decisions.

The basic RTS/MOBA experience of gathering resources and then skirmishing is just really fun. As champions grow in level, neutral monsters become less relevant and easier to clear. This means that it's optimal to start taking from your opponents and pressing other objectives, like towers and player kills, more and more as the game goes on. This results in the gradual coming together of teams that changes the dynamic, and of the RTS/MOBA games that I've played, League and Starcraft do this best. (Dota2 is more like who can ninja stab people from the shadows the best :P)

"
maeby-marryme,AskReddit,1389686653.0,My wife is cheating on me with her cousin.
Deezl-Vegas,changemyview,1389686660.0,"Being put in PvP situations with constant environmental goals to keep an eye on is much more interactive. The players must PvP or lose access to farm and powerful jungle buffs. However, if you PvP and fail, you lose more than you would have if you hadn't done it at all. The decisions you make throughout the game are always geared towards maximizing yourself and taking something away from the other players, and the game emphasizes player strategy decisions over mechanical skill.


Now, let's do some comparisons:

*League vs. SC2:*

*League is built around solo/duo play for 5-10 minutes leading into team play for the rest of the game. It prioritizes strategy and awareness as winning traits, and it's a social game.
*SC2 is built around solo play involving strategy and mechanics. The first 5-10 minutes are a warm-up period without action, and 90% of games are almost exactly the same up through 20 supply.

**League is better for casual players.**
There's no comparison. The winner of Bronze-Platinum SC2 games is almost exclusively decided by build order execution and the ability to macro and multi-task. It can feel very unrewarding to the casual player, and it's a very scientific game until you get to the highest level. League, on the other hand, provides new players with simple roles to follow and limits mechanical requirements. They also made a conscious decision to equalize the gold gain for all players by providing lots of passive gold along with opportunity to farm, which means that stomps are less likely. Rewards for an action are doled out immediately -- you use a skill series well against an enemy? Instant damage and success and a potential long term advantage. If you drop your mules on time and use your Chronoboost perfectly in SC2, you might not even see the benefit. These tasks are very important to your long-term winrate, but they're just not fun.

You might say, but who cares about casuals? Well, a good casual experience is often a good indicator of replay value and style. Plus, now we can get chicks into gaming. We can get your dad into gaming. By bridging the gap between the 90% male 16-25 demographic and the rest of the world, we can make games more socially acceptable and more fun for everyone. There are way too many games that are designed by gamers for gamers, but the classics are the games that EVERYONE can play and have fun.

**League is a better social game**
SC2's Arcade hasn't really taken off like the custom game scene in SC1 and WC3, and 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 are all joke just for fun modes. The social accommodations in BNet 2.0 are also a bit of a joke. I won't say the PVP.net client is godlike, but boy is it easy to make a party and kick it with your friends.

**Starcraft is better mechanically**
The original Starcraft is one of the most mechanically challenging games possible because our kind friends at Blizzard really went out of their way to make many ways to do many things quickly using hotkeys. In that game, you can make decisions as fast as you can type. In League, your mad skills are confined to the cooldowns of one character and a max of one summon. However, that doesn't mean that League doesn't take skill -- in fact, the opposite is true. Players like Faker and Bjergsen are so highly skilled that Diamond 1 players literally cannot beat them in lane and often get crushed to the point of that one lane losing the game for their entire team, despite what I said about passive gold gain leveling the playing field. Dota2 players especially will often comment on the lack of ""skill"" required, but they severely discount the ability of these players to make precise movements and maximize their damage potential in the face of a rain of deadly skillshots.

**League vs. Dota2**

Dota is the foundation of League of Legends, and it's very easy to compare LoL to Dota -em from the WC3 days. However, I think League is the better game in terms of player experience and design.

**League has more character customization than Dota2**

You have both runepages and masteries, which allow your character to take different roles depending on how you build them. The presence of AP allows casters to scale and become carries, and the build paths for all characters allow each role to choose between tankiness and support and pure offense and lifesteal or a mix. You could argue that the metagame is more flexible in Dota, but then again, Admiral Bulldog and co picked basically the same team all the way through The International...

**Snowballing is less present in League**
Snowballing is a concept where one side of the field has an extremely un-fun experience of being rolled by 1-2 opposing team members that literally can't be stopped. This is because end-game item sets in Dota2 are extremely powerful, and there's little to be done against a lifestealer with BKB and too much damage and HP to beat. This means if you're not aware of the meta-threats, you can just lose outright to a farmed character even though you thought your team was on equal footing.

This also encourages lone wolf behavior because some people realize that it's 100% better to farm than to help your team out. 4v5ing with a perma-farm character is optimal. In solo queue, this leads to blaming and flaming when the lifestealer mentioned above is doing the optimal play of stacking camps and farming lanes while his team is getting massacred. This is a non-intuitive, anti-fun strategy that League has mostly solved by making teamfights the focus instead of just an option.

**The support role in Dota is meh**
Dota generally runs 2-3 ""support"" characters. These characters are often denied the pleasure of farming to the point where they are often asked to pull camps off to one side and not leech exp from the main carries. It's optimal to simply push them out of the way so a snowball character can get a head start. It's still an important role and very rewarding, but it can make the game really non-interactive and non-intuitive.

Support in League is an active tandem role with the AD and involves almost exclusively battling it out with the other support/AD during the laning phase. It's very interactive and fun, and support AoE abilities are as crucial to League teamfights as supports like Jakiro are to Dota2.

**League is much more beginner-friendly**
No death penalties and improved controls with less confusing mechanics -- need I say more? League's design actively encourages new players to build up good habits. I don't think you can say this for Dota at all.

**Dota is a deeper game**
I would agree that Dota has more depth and strategy than League. Most games in League are roughly the same as far as the overarching plot. In Dota, the subtlety of denying creeps and towers and the difference in power of various late-game carries forces the players to act and plan with foresight. A friend once told me that ""everyone in Dota is overpowered. That's why it's balanced."" I agree with the sentiment.

However, I'd argue that the map in League is more nuanced, and brushes are strategically placed to give each side a defender's advantage and to allow warding to grant tangible control over certain areas. Travel times between lanes are balanced so that there is a resource cost to leaving your lane to pressure another one. The designers also make very nuanced changes every now and then that affect overplayed strategies in subtle ways to avoid having the game become repetitive. These things are important to keep the experience fresh for those that play often and to add depth, and League has more than enough strategy to keep up with the other games.

Dota is also more about learning to play Dota than learning general best practices. For instance, the map in Dota contains tons of little pathways where someone can secret away in the trees and not be found. Combine this with TP scrolls, and you basically have a free out for anyone who has a TP handy. Players without TP scrolls and knowledge of these paths are at a huge disadvantage. League has a few spots that deny vision slightly and plenty of bushes, but you don't have to spend time studying them, and recall takes much longer than TP, so teleporting out of danger is sub-optimal in most cases. In League, you very often have to play the hand you're dealt, which means that you simply have to out-skill your opponent in combat or blow a mobility cooldown like flash to escape.

It may seem a small thing, but the league designers have made lots of choices to push the game in the direction away from a farm-fest and more into a constant duel of skillshots and contests for territory.

**These two games are so similar that it's hard to compare them side by side and say that one is better, but I think League is more fun to play by a small margin, and it's certainly easier to grasp.**

There you have it. Don't judge a book by its cover! If you look a bit deeper, you'll find that there are many more levels of interaction in League that you just haven't experienced yet. I would recommend Path of Exile for you, as it has a lot of the good characteristics of top-down games and tons of customization and skill potential with great graphics and an awesome aesthetic and community. Keep trying at League, though -- the real game doesn't start until level 30 anyway!"

Varryl,cars,1389686742.0,"2011 Subaru STI sedan. paid $30,900, certified. They said the guy who owned it drove it for 7k miles and then got a Boss Mustang. 

The Good: Plenty of power, AWD is fun in low traction, big Subie community, plenty of looks (from men at least,) handles well, has everything I need (seat warmers, bluetooth, USB, back seats fold down,) loud horn, good sound, super moddable, reliable, and pretty from some angles

The Bad: Sometimes too loud (road and wind noise,) slurps premium gas, turbo lag, stereo sucks, stiff ride, understeers at limit, girls don't seem interested, interior rattles, needs more power for money spent. 

The special: It does nearly everything well. I make Ikea runs in it and shuttle the kids. I drive it across town, and when I put my foot down I can pass just about anyone I want. It'll stick to the road even when unpaved, and the unique boxer exhaust note sounds great. It was my dream car for 8 years. 

Would I buy it again: Yes, but I probably would have waited longer. I had a WRX before this, a 2010 which was perfectly fine. I don't regret buying it although it was at the edge of my affordability.  

Funny stories: First date with my gf, I told her a drove a Subaru. We had a good date, and we walked to our cars. She took one look at its frippery and said ""WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!"" 

I also had a dude who checked out the car and went ""Nice Evo, good V6.""

If the shifter is broken the way yours is, it's not actually going all the way into Park.

That's why when your shifter is in Park and you can't get the key out, it's not actually in Park, it's off a little bit. Then when you play with it a little bit and take the shifter apart, you can get it back into Park and it releases the key.

I don't have specifics nor do I have access to an exploded view for the shifter in your particular Transit right now to elaborate, but that's the gist of it.

- Making sure I'm logging out in a sanctuary helps for rested XP the next day.
- First I do my Daily Roulette quests for additional XP
- Then I do some quests/level quests in between dungeon queues. Lots of people recommend the ['Beckon' levelquests](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1tzld1/best_battlecraft_escort_leves_for_grinding/) for some easy XP. 
- You can pop some fates in-between if you want but there aren't so many groups these days. If you can though, do it :D
- Use Party Finder (if your friends are busy) to get instant/fast queue times. Worst case just find a tank if you're not playing one. You're also running with people who should now what they're doing and this will speed up how long dungeons take.
- Explore the whole dungeon - if you're XP farming then it's better to kill everything imo.
- Use food/guild buff. Adding that little % of XP is nice PLUS the food bonus might help you kill mobs much quicker.

There's also the much lauded Bastion, which has gorgeous graphics and sound assets, interesting appraoch to story, is very moody. However, gameplay wise it might be on the more challenging side.

UlgraTheTerrible,bipolar,1389691038.0,"Afraid I went from ""normal"" to ""Type 1"" overnight... Or so it felt. 

But... The labels don't mean much, generally just a descriptor of how severe it *can* get. I *can* get so up that I think I'm Buddha's reincarnated wife and I see angels and demons arguing over my soul.... 

But. But. But. 

That, m'dear, has happened to me exactly *once*, during the episode that got me my diagnosis. Once, in nearly six years post diagnosis... Once, in nearly 28 years of existence. 

While I definitely still experience some cycles, they're obvious pretty much only to me, (seems like they're mostly ""internal"" episodes) and the people who know my diagnosis can *sometimes* notice I might be a *little* up or down, but the ones who don't know my diagnosis are *shocked* when they find out. 

So that is me, with Bipolar I. I tend towards longer cycles of mild depression most of the time, with sporadic bursts of hypomania for about three days here and there, and I've had two fairly mild mixed episodes. 

I don't want to minimize my struggles, they have, at times, nearly killed me, but I also see a lot of people on here with Bipolar II, more ""severe"" Bipolar I, or rapid cycling... 

And I don't envy them. Because the thing is, the labels just tell you some clinical aspect of the way the illness expresses itself. Bipolar II people tend to struggle with much worse depression and much milder mania, that can nevertheless be more damaging overall than full blown Jesuspants mania, because if you have too much crazy, you're not nearly so capable to ruin your finances or interpersonal relationships, because it is *really fucking obvious* that there's something wrong...

So I feel it's helpful for you to understand what the label *really* means. And all that it *really* means is that your mania can (*not* will) go to Jesuspants levels and you are more prone to mixed episodes. 

It doesn't mean that you'll have *more* episodes than someone with Bipolar II. It doesn't mean that you'll have *less*. It doesn't even mean that your episodes will be more damaging long-term to your life. Frankly, I was out there with a capital OUT. But I didn't ruin my finances. I've never cheated on anyone in my life. I'm doing pretty okay now, and have been enjoying such for quite a while. 

So it's a mistake to think that your label means you have ""worse"" bipolar now. It is a severe mental illness. But... Bipolar II is a severe mental illness. The only reason people think it is more severe is because the out there episodes are so much more noticeable. 

But people are stupid. They do tend to think that the guy shouting at clouds has it ""worse"" than the guy who's about to lose his house to foreclosure and hasn't been able to tell his wife... 

Welcome to Bipolar I. Maybe you'll like it here, when you find a good med balance. Maybe you'll like it better than ""II""... ;)"

He then tried to manipulate me into sleeping with him by admitting he had mental health issues and needed a woman to make him feel loved and happy again. I didn't believe him, but it was *so hard* to say to his face 'I think you're bullshitting for sex' when he's talking to me about it. I just kept thinking 'But what if he really has depression, then I'm a total bitch for not helping him!'  
When that didn't get him anywhere though, he kept forcing his hands down my panties. He was a big guy, like 6ft5 and thick built. I couldn't pull his hand out even though I kept trying to. I had to keep pushing him off and stepping back to move his hand out. He said I should expect it because I let him stay, and that if I didn't want it, I wouldn't have let him come back with me. He wouldn't leave in the morning either, just kept trying to have sex. I just wanted him to go but felt so guilty about it.  
Now I'm older and wiser, I'd be calling the police to get that douchebag out my pants and out my house. But when I was more naive to this kind of bullshit, I let it happen. It really pisses me off thinking back about it. Be strong and know your boundaries and don't let anyone make you feel bad for sticking to them. Internet hugs!

TheWorldIsAhead,AdviceAnimals,1389691722.0,"Thank you! Very, very informative. I have a follow-up question. I've heard from many people about how as soon as you ""grow up"" passing college classes becomes so easy. I'm good friends with an old high school teacher of mine, and she is a teacher, a mother of young children and is currently studying with way less time on her hand than she had in her college days, but now she is getting stellar grades like it's nothing. 

What is exactly is the frame of mine of the older student and how do I tap into it at 22 now that I am about to major in engineering which is a tough math heavy subject with a high failure rate?"
cluberti,AskMen,1389691731.0,"There are lots of factors to consider as men age, but it's true that weight will matter to a good degree, as will stress (and how he deals with it, or doesn't).  I'm much older than he is at this point in my life, but I do remember around 30 or so is when I had my first position with my employer that had real responsibility (not just do your job sort of responsibility, but if things fuck up the company loses a ton and you're still just as fired), and the stress was a factor in my libido.  I was overweight as well, partially because of the stress and partially because my wife is a kick-ass cook - we had sex rarely (maybe once a month, sometimes every other month).

It's gotten better over the intervening years (I've lost some weight and handle stress much better due to experience), but my libido is definitely not what it was when I was 24.  That's both genetics and biology as a man, but it's also that as a race we aren't really evolved to be monogamous.  We can do it (and there are really some great benefits to doing so), but it's still a reality that our sexual evolution over human history wasn't based on long-term cohabitation - that idea, when compared to the length of human history, is relatively new indeed.

Psychologists who study this sort of thing seem to agree that sexual novelty and variety can lessen this effect over time, along with dealing with the complications that the normal, separate portions of the lives of two different people will bring over the years.  I used to fail to grasp why my elders all seemed to agree that a good marriage (and by association, a good partnership - marriage not required) is something that you had to work at, because mine was awesome in my 20s and early 30s.  However, as I've gotten older (some might say wiser, but I'm not sure I'd always agree....) I've realized that it is indeed true.  While relationships and the sexual experiences that are attached to them are usually easier for us to get and enjoy when we're younger, it gets harder as you get older, life gets more complicated, and *you* get more complicated, along with your partner.  This is where the work comes in - being more adventurous at times, and understanding at times that life will make it hard for both of you to have more sex than one or both of you desire.  I think that, as long as you're both working at it and are open and honest with each other when this sort of thing happens, such a spell should lack permanence."

irrational_abbztract,netflix,1389691880.0,The books were definitely amazing just like many of Ludlum's creations. I can however understand why the movie (or any movie made off a book) isn't the same. Its because there's only so much you can put into a movie of 1.5 - 2 hours. I myself loved the movies as much as the books because of the fact that they did the best they could and it was pretty damn good. Damon's work in the Bourne series is better than anything else I've seen him do. And the Damon Bourne's are definitely a lot better than the Renner's Bourne Legacy.

If you look at Legacy as a separate movie without comparing it to the Damon ones, its a good movie. Nothing compared to the Damon ones though. I still long to find something that can come even close to the original Bourne movies. And I doubt there ever will be a movie that gets close enough.

Edit: ah yeah I know what you mean. I did read the Bourne Legacy because I wanted to see whether Lustbader is any good and personally he doesn't even come close to flow as well as Ludlum. Its just..strange compared to how well Ludlum wrote his work. Not good enough.

cluberti,AskMen,1389692687.0,"Yeah, I've gotta go with the ""I'd probably kill him"" crowd, and not in the half-joking, smiley kind of way either.  Your father might be a douchebag (sounds like he is, at least towards women), but as a father with a daughter there's just something about anyone doing anything to her that would flip that switch.  If something along those lines happened to my son I'd probably want to do the same thing, but..... with my daughter, the reaction would be instantaneous and probably inextinguishable.  I cannot explain it, and I'd wager most men with daughters on here would agree that this would be a pretty typical reaction.  There's the rest of the women in the world, and then there's *my daughter*.  I am raising her (hopefully) to be able to be honest with me, and I'd want to know as soon as it happened.  I'd take her to the hospital, get the police involved as soon as possible afterwards, and then I'd be on the warpath.  I know it's horrible to put that in writing, but... damn.  Someone touches my daughter in an inappropriate way, and it's probably the last thing they'd do for a long time, maybe forever.  Hopefully that doesn't scare you, but it's just a father thing - if he loves you, it's likely going to be his behavior.

I'd say give your father the chance, and go to the hospital if you haven't already regardless.  Write everything down as you remember it, and if it's been less than 72 hours, it's even more important you go to the hospital as a rape kit can likely still be administered.  I agree with others who say to go to the ER first, if this is the case, as they'll notify the authorities for you - don't waste time, and don't run the risk someone gives you a hard time.

Even if your father does turn out to be a complete loser (I certainly hope he doesn't, but anything is possible), he still deserves to know, and you still deserve to not have your body violated."

axehomeless,Android,1389693111.0,"You really don't see how this is different and not at all the exact same thing?

Two big reasons.

1. The OMAP 4460 is barely used in the Android world, the 4430 is in the first Glass edition and in some Nooks, that's pretty much it. One of the reasons Google provides updates to their devices is so that it helps OEMs (and even communities) to port the newer version of android onto devices with the same chipset. There aren't really any GNexs out there (we know the numbers from the Samsung trial, it'S astronomically small) and there aren't any other devices with the OMAP chipsets. There are however millions of Android devices, especially tablets with the T3 chipset.

2. The crux: OMAP went out of fucking business. nFuckingVIdia DID NOT. The latest binaries for the 4460 are from december **2012**, with the reasons above, it IS understandble not to go through all the trouble in recreating the binaries from scratch for a handful of smartphone enthusiasts and NOTHING more. Google doesn't make money in selling you devices, if you don't like what they did, buy something else, Google won't care.
But HTC and NVidia are both very much in the business of making partners and customers happy, if nVidia says ""fuck it"" instead of TI, THEY'RE STILL IN BUSINESS. Same with HTC, they care about you buying HTC again, Google doesn't give a shit if you buy Samsung, HTC, from them, Sony etc. Maybe a bit bias towards motorola but that's exactly what I mean.

That said, the PGCE (UK) is highly sought after in international private schools here in Europe, and accepted in other many countries around the world. Plus if you choose the post-graduate (vs the professional) then you get 60 credits to put towards a Masters of Education - which I would highly recommend getting before leaving.

Well why is that?

Because hardware isn't everything, for people who don't always want CM and slap it on there, the experience matters, and feel and software of the MotoX is superior to the LGG2. I would never ever recommend that phone to a friend who wants to try android and comes from a different smartphone platform like iOS. I would recommend the MotoX.
Why? Because it's fast, it looks great, it's lean, it's streamlined, it has very useful features people actually use (and love) and you get your updates fast. Can't say a single thing except the fastness about the G2.

* check the prices of Abyss Crystals vs Infinite Dust - you can use Abyssal Shatter to destroy the crystals into infinite dust and the relevant greater essences (cosmic I think?) this makes me a LOT of gold on my server

* use TSM Destroy and search for ""Sha Crystal"" you can find people who post MoP epics for well under the price of a sha crystal. This can make you some easy gold (especially since MoP epics have a chance to de into 2 crystals) the other day I bought 3 MoP boe Epics for under 100g each, and got 5 sha crystals out of them (200g per crystal on my server) so a good 700g or so profit for a couple minutes work - this could be even higher if you have enchant patterns to use the crystals for

* This one will take a little work and number crunching - but it could be well worth it. Look for enchanting material bottlenecks - basically - you want to find places where you need a LOT of a certain material, especially one that's harder to find - check [here](http://www.wow-professions.com/wowguides) for the enchanting powerleveling guide a lot of people will use (they're the best out there for powerleveling professions IMO). See if you can make those mats cheaper, perhaps by buying cloth and crafting something with tailoring then disenchanting it. Those little niche markets can make you TONS of gold. Back in the day (vanilla that is) I found a market like this and was RICH, at least by vanilla standards. When the quests to upgrade the dungeon sets came out, it required Greater Eternal Essences pretty early on in the long questline. I figured out I could make wicked leather headbands and disenchant them and get a TON of essences - I made thousands of gold back then (this was a time when something like 5k gold was unheard of for the large majority of players)

I have a hunter on a low pop server and i've been still making some sales on transmog - check TUJ and buy things that are 1/10th of their normal price, then keep reposting them for their ""normal"" price - if they're something popular, they will likely sell eventually. (you can find some other good deals this way too - I bought a warlock green fire quest book for 1k and resold for 8k the other day - thanks TUJ!)

* If your server is low pop - pets might sell well - check on the prices of some of the battle pets from old raids - you could probably farm quite a few of them to sell (check out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoWGoldMaking/comments/1un1je/what_is_the_best_way_to_make_gold_if_im_only/cele8cr) for a post I made about things basically any class should be able to solo.) With arbitrage of pets (transferring them from my main high pop server) I've gone from under 500g to well over 20k gold on my 2nd server where I only have a level 70 hunter... only reason I xfer them is because the old raid pets don't sell well on my high-pop main server, and I run the old raids either way (for xmog, enjoyment, mounts, etc) so I have them anyways - you could easily farm them exactly the same on the low-pop server itself and sell them the same way. 

* just looking at your TUJ link - I see a leaping hatchling for CHEAP - buy that right now and repost it for a couple thousand (keep reposting it, it's a fairly rare battle pet and it'll sell eventually - and even if it doesn't - yo uonly spend like 50g on it anyways) If you're feeling truly adventurous - I see a Jaina's Locket on the AH - and a Muradin's Favor (looks like someone just made shadowmourne) - the Locket is really cheap compared to what it usually goes for - might want to snap that up and keep reposting it closer to the 15-20k range (you're low pop - it's rare to begin with) that one is a risk though, someone will have to come along who wants it and has the gold to blow... but you never know.

Hope this helps a bit! If you have questions feel free to hit me up - I'm not expert, but I'll do the best I can for you!"

BlueCarrotAntenna,europe,1389697558.0,"I think the mistake /u/Nimonic is referring to is that while the area on the map does indeed show the ancestral lands of the Sami, it is by no means ethnographically majorly Sami. There are a few regions where Sami are the majority, but they cover only a small portion of this area.

As the wikipedia article you linked mentions, most Sami in Norway for example in fact live in Oslo (which is down south below the borders of the ancestral lands).

AkiraZXE,MensRights,1389698456.0,"&gt; They should be given the same sentence the ""rapist"" would have gotten if he'd gone to prison.

&gt; I agree - they should spend the next 5 to 80 years in a men's prison.

Look, I'll walk everyone through the chain of logic here. X knowingly and maliciously accuses Y of a rape that did not happen. Y is not only found innocent, but X, without a shadow of a doubt, is found to be, as stated above, falsely accusing Y knowingly and maliciously. Therefore, X should be subject to the punishment that Y would have been subject to should the truth never have been discovered. It is, from the very first moment, assuming that the accusation is false and malicious, not assuming that every case that does not end in conviction is like that. It's ""in cases of false accusations"", not ""in cases where we're unsure"".

*At no point* during this do we say ""X should be raped"" or ""all rape cases that do not end in definite conviction on one end should end with conviction on the other"". In fact, you'd have to already assume we're all out to use rape as punishment or whatever other boogeyman you've created for us in order to assume that's what's being said. Hell, it's not even saying *how* to go about it. It's not trying to completely rebuild the legal system from the ground up, nor is it saying it should just be shoehorned in there. It's a fairly general statement.

If you wanted to disagree with what is essentially a general attitude about how to reach justice, that's absolutely fine. If you want to break it down and explain, in far greater detail than he ever intended to go into, why it would not or should not work that way, even better!

There was a laundrette and a kebab shop behind me, and a small off-licence across the narrow street. All closed. Nothing out of the ordinary. And nothing to help me find my way.


I pulled out the frayed napkin from my jacket pocket, squinting at the directions scrawled onto it. I’d definitely gotten off at the right stop, but it looked as though the Doctor’s shop was a bit further away still. There was an alleyway nearby that I could cut through, which would probably get me there quicker, but one look at the deep black shadows within was enough to convince me to take the long way around. A violent shiver ran down my spine, but I dismissed it. I let out a deep breath, watching it mingle with the dense fog around me. I stuffed my hands into my pockets and was about to move on when something occurred to me; I hadn’t heard a single sound since stepping onto this street, other than the ones I was making. Nor had I, in fact, seen any sign of life. My chest tightened. I was running out of time. They’d be here soon. I had to get to the Doctor’s shop, and fast. He’d be able to set everything right. I felt a surge of nausea as I looked again down the alleyway, and hurried into it’s black embrace.


I kept my head down, and my feet moving. The darkness was constant, unrelenting. Up ahead there was a sickly yellow light, illuminating a rusty door. It shook as I passed it, causing me to yelp. I picked up the pace. How long did this path go? Surely I should have come out the other end by now. Voices filled my head, voices that I didn’t recognise, laughing and jeering. Footsteps now, from behind me, approaching fast, building up into a run. I ran too. I ran until my breath was ragged and my feet were sore, and all the while the voices in my head grew louder to an insane clamour. Several times, I passed the rusty door with the yellow light, and only after the sixth time, did I come to a stop.


“Off somewhere, are we?” came a voice like the swell of putrid water in a dark, tangled swamp. A voice I recognised. “Off to finish our deal, perhaps?”


The other voices in my head were gone now, and I opened my mouth to speak, but could only stammer. From the shadows around me, luminous eyes appeared, bright and inhuman. Dozens, at first, then hundreds, all different sizes, all filled with lunatic glee. From somewhere, there was a steady beating of ancient drums.


“No time. Out of time. Now. We take it *now*. *NOW*.
 

I was foolish to think I could run from them, I did so nonetheless, racing through the shadows and then, jarringly, emerging from the alley after just a few steps. I nearly toppled to the ground as I came to a halt on the edge of the road. I immediately spotted the Doctor’s shop, a small antiques store, it’s lights glowing in the fog just a short distance away. I took a step towards it and stumbled over something. I looked down and terror filled me, spreading out from my chest to consume me utterly. A homeless man, curled up on a tattered sheet of cardboard, his dirty eyes blinking open, looking up at me, confused. The voices filled my head again.


*Now, now, now, now, now, NOW*


There was a knife in my hand, and I didn’t try to think where it’d come from. The wretched man and I screamed together as I fell on him, stabbing again and again, until the screaming came only from me. My body shook, my eyes watered, and there was a rich sickness in my bowels that felt like damnation. With my trembling, blood drenched hands I took the small totem, a grinning monkey with an upraised sword, from my trouser pocket, and held it over the ruin of the man. Instantly it glowed, throbbing with a black-red light. I thought I heard a cry of terrible pain on the air, but it could’ve just been me. Eventually, I rose to my feet and paced wearily back to the alley. The shadows felt oddly safe and comforting now. At the yellow light by the rusty door, the eyes appeared again, now wide and expectant. I held up the totem and there was a sound of wind, or perhaps, a thousand creatures inhaling deeply. They exhaled with a deep, satisfied sigh, and one by one, the eyes closed.


“The debt is paid,” said the swamp voice, “for now.”


The light above the door turned off with a quiet click and, as I stood alone in the darkness, I laughed, and laughed, and screamed."

You want citations, ok.
Harvard study shows that 70% of all non-reciprocal domestic violence is committed by women, the American Psychiatric Association corroborated: http://newscastmedia.com/domestic-violence.htm
Or you can just read this very handy paper from: http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/downloads/304/kelly.pdf

Women are abusive towards children more often than men are: http://www.safehorizon.org/index/what-we-do-2/child-abuse--incest-55/child-abuse-statistics--facts-304.html
https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/fatherhood/chapterthree.cfm

Worth noting, in cases like this, government statistics are going to be based on conviction rates. Women are less likely to be charged and sentenced for any crime, which would naturally include committing domestic, sexual, and child abuse.

Now, consider that until federal guidelines/definitons were changed it was actually impossible for a woman to rape a man.
http://www.vocativ.com/10-2013/hard-truth-girl-guy-rape/
http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf
The CDC does not even include ""Made to penetrate"" as a form of rape, no matter that the male did not give consent, and erections are physiological responses independent of a man's desire. And there is a wealth of literature and studies that show that men are far less likely to report such crimes committed against them, so the numbers we do have are probably very deflated —I have confidence that you are a strong independent woman/white knight who can look up those studies on your own.

On the other hand, we have a wealth of evidence that show women are more likely to lie about being sexually abused or raped: http://www.theforensicexaminer.com/archive/spring09/15/

And then you read crap like this: http://www.americanbar.org/publications/criminal_justice_magazine_home/crimjust_cjmag_16_1_wald.html where a female judge is calling for even more lenient treatment of women who commit crimes because, ""Women have special needs, and men are scarier."" Ignoring that violence committed by women is ignored, brushed off, or reinterpreted to blame the male victim.

In fact, it is funny how feminists go on and on about victim blaming, but when a man is the victim they are quick to point out how he deserved it.﻿"

Everton are playing great football but i just don't think they have the depth, a knock to Lukaku and they will struggle for goals. The center of their defense is a bit older and has a history of getting knocks with no serious depth behind it.

Basilgate,WritingPrompts,1389703378.0,"Fluffles, the bunny princess, hopped merrily through the orchard.


“Now remember, Fluffles,” said her father, the king, before she left. “Be careful of snakes and dogs and foxes. If you see one, you must run as fast as your little legs will carry you.”


Fluffles had laughed then, and she laughed now. No big bad doggy, or sneaky fox, or slithery snake was going to scare her. After all, she was a princess.


Fluffles came to a tree that was positively bursting with apples, with many having fallen off. As she was picking them off the grass, and putting them into her basket, a pair of squirrels bounded up to her.


“These are my apples,” she said, snootily, “Don’t you touch, squirrels.”

“Oh no, princess,” said one of them, “We just came to warn you we saw a fox out there. You should be ever so careful. And besides, we prefer nuts.”

“You *are* nuts if you think I’m scared of a sneaky old fox,” she said with a sniff.


The squirrels looked at each other, a bit concerned.


“Well, okay,” they said, and scurried away.


*Scaredy squirrels,* the bunny princess thought, and, now that her basket was full, made her way back home.


On the way there, she heard some commotion from a thicket, in the woods, nearby. It sounded like there was a mighty scrap going on, with lots of yelling and shouting. Being a princess, and a bit of a busy-body, Fluffles decided she had to interfere. She set her basket aside and hopped into the woods.


“Oi,” she said, approaching a tangle of bushes that the yelling and shaking was coming from. “What’s going on here?”


Suddenly, there was a flash of red fur, as something big jumped from the bushes and landed in front of her. The sneaky fox! The big red beast grinned down at her with a mouthful of wet, pointy teeth.


“Well, well,” he said, in a rather elegant voice, “I daresay I’m in the presence of none other than princess *Dinner.*”

“Back off you creepy old mutt,” she said, picking up a stick and pointing it threateningly at him.

“Oh my! How frightful. Oh please, dear majestic princess, don’t harm me. I’m but a cowardly old fox, please. I surrender. I surrender.”


Fluffles, in spite of her confidence, was a little surprised.


“Really?” she said.

“Ha... no, not really.”


The fox leapt forward and slammed his jaws around Fluffles’ leg. The pain was instant and blinding, and Fluffles screamed as she fell to the hard earth. The fox cackled, licking the blood from his jaws. She screamed again, louder this time, causing the fox to wince.


“Shut the fuck up, you little slut,” he said, scowling at her.


Moaning, she tried to crawl away, but the fox put a lazy paw onto her chest, easily holding her down. Her breath became frantic and ragged as his mouth opened around her. The stench of rotting meat filled her world and made her gag. She could feel consciousness slipping away when, suddenly, the fox stopped. Everything seemed to have frozen until the fox started wailing. He stumbled back, holding the spot where his eye had once been, that was now a torrent of gushing blood. Fluffles managed to pull herself upright to see the two squirrels from earlier leap from the surrounding trees, dressed in black ninja attire, and slicing at the fox with long swords. He flailed about aimlessly, trying to hit them, but they were too fast. After performing a few spectacular somersaults, they landed in front of the princess with their blades raised.


“Get the fuck away from her, you piece of shit.”

""Fucking squirrels!"" the fox snapped, spitting blood and drool everywhere. ""I'll fucking kill you!""


The fox roared and ran at them, and the squirrels, with perfectly synchronised moves, leapt up and jammed their swords into either side of his neck. He stumbled and gargled, collapsing to the blood-stained grass, twitching one last time before finally laying still.


Fluffles’ mouth was agape, and she almost didn’t notice the pain in her leg anymore. The squirrel warriors approached her and helped her up.


“Let’s get the fuck outta here,” she said, wincing. “You motherfuckers want some apples?”

“Bitch, what did we tell you? We prefer *nuts*.”

“Suck *my* nuts, asshole.”


And they all laughed.

Fast forward to college and some of my classmate attend the same regional university that I do.  I get a call from one of these friends right before Halloween (first semester of college) that he and his girlfriend have a friend they want to introduce me to.

They want to do a double date to go out to eat, hit the ""Haunted Woods"" and then hang out...

So, I meet the girl, she's attractive, smart - I can't fault my bro for that. I'm pleased.  We're having fun, we go to the Haunted Woods, and I get the hand holding and frightened cuddles that make scary places worthwhile.

Afterwards we go back to the dorms and hang out at my buddy's room.  He has a private room and couches - it's cozy.  He and his lady are on one couch, girl is sitting next to me, and we're chatting.  As happens, my buddy brings up my old crush to kinda tease me - specifically that I have thing for redheads.  My date is blonde...

This is a Thursday night.

The next morning I see my date from the night before on campus.  Her hair is now red.  It is ~9am.  Between 1am when the date ended and 9am on campus she went to Wal-Mart bought dye, and dyed her hair to the color I like.

KraVok,engineering,1389704504.0,"Glad you think it's interesting.

In terms of work environment, in my experience, startups are generally more stressful than ""corporate"" jobs, and generally you have more work. However, there tends to be more upside (stock options that represent a decent chunk of the company, more involvement in the actual success of the business, learning a ton, etc).

So yes, there are moments where you work a lot (I've been through a period where basically everyone came to work weeks, weekends, anytime essentially, for like 2 months straight because of an important deadline), but I find it very rewarding when all that work pays off.

With all that being said, there are such opportunities for most engineering majors, so don't feel like you need to stick to EE, CompE or Software Engineering to work in a startup. Also, this is only my experience. Your best bet is probably to find an internship as early as you can during your studies to validate where you want to end up."

junkeee999,atheism,1389704829.0,"Well that's the problem with the internet. It's a big place. When I said, 'nobody gives a fuck' it was for effect, it was a generalization. Of course I understand that countless exceptions exist in the world. 

But I still stand by my point that in a VAST majority of situations, simply sitting there and saying or doing nothing for a few seconds is the proper way to go. There's no need to hijack a simple pre-meal ritual and turn into a forum on atheism.

I would consider announcing your atheism in that situation every bit as rude as a Christian dining at a home where they don't say grace and announcing that he or she was going to say a prayer.

It's more about simply respecting the customs of your guests, especially when they're harmless little customs. There's a time and place to make a stand. A dinner party isn't it."

nickmista,australia,1389705700.0,"I suppose this is why there are courts and lawyers, for when there is disagreement between how people view someone as fitting in a legal definition.

&gt; (a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.
(b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.

Under the Australian definition I would say this case would rest on whether they can prove that McNeill showed reckless indifference to human life or had intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. I'm certainly not qualified enough to make the judgment but I would think that given his actions and the act of hitting someone unsuspectingly in the head you could likely prove he had intent to inflict greivous bodily harm if not that I think he definitely at least showed reckless indifference to human life. Consequently by fitting either of those definitions he would be guilty of murder as opposed to manslaughter."

furthermore, you have no idea what your current investment strategy is. No, giving it to this @home-hedgefunder is not an investment strategy. Plus you have no guarantee of returns or limited losses. Will this guy hit big one day and then the next day get margin called on your money? FYI, that means your money is GONE, GONE, GONE.

14% isn't bad for that time period. The major indexes between 11/10/13 and 1/1/14 averaged about 5%, so your guy got your more than that, OR SO HE AND YOU CLAIM. Maybe he's lying to you, maybe he's being honest. Who knows? I'll tell you one thing, he doesn't seem to be contractually obligated to not lie to you and steal your money. And in any case, around the world there is a saying, ""Easy come, easy go.""

But like you are reading from others, there is something definitely not right going on, and you just have to live with a bunch of random internet people saying that, or listen to the advice you find in /r/investing and /r/personalfinance Those are more or less the new-to-handling-money subs anyway.

Heck even on tv you have a lot of people moving towards not watching on a week by week basis but instead waiting till the season is over and then watching the entire season over a relatively short period of time.

If it's crowded and I'm in the weeds, establish eye contact and smile, know exactly what you want (i.e. don't get two drinks into your order then turn around to the person behind you and ask what they wanted again), speak loudly and clearly without spitting in my face, and tip me generously on the first round. I can't guarantee it, but I'll try to make damn sure you get served sooner than others. Bonus if you keep ordering the same thing, b/c then I can skip the conversation part and have your next round up with minimal time spent. It also helps if you're attractive, regardless of gender. If further helps if you know my name, and call me by it (but don't bark it at me across the room). I'm not going to comp you a beer, because you'll nurse it and I won't see another order from you for 15-20 minutes. I will comp shots or shooters, which are consumed quickly, immediately after which you'll order something else. If you ever snap your fingers at me I guaran-damn-tee you'll be that last person I serve. 

If it's not crowded and you're not like piglets at the teat, I presume ""better service"" means stronger drinks, or a little bit extra. Be my friend in a genuine way. Have a conversation the way you would anybody else, and not like you're working an angle. I can probably make your drink a bit stronger, and, if there happens to be something left in the shaker tin after I make a round of shooters, it may end up in a glass in front of you.

I went to church when I was a kid. Neither of my parents believed in it, really, and made us go until we were 10 I think for the ""morals"" aspect. Though I am not Christian now, I do credit going to church at a young age for my inquisitive nature when it comes to religions. But that is only because my Sunday school teacher told me ""Jesus doesn't like it when you ask too many questions."" when I kept asking about things that didn't make sense to me.

Anyway, before I had children the thought popped into my head to send them to church for a while so they could get the experience as well. But then it dawned on me. I only credit the church with the basic theological expansion of my mind because my parents were never there for me to teach me anything of the sort or answer any questions for me. I *am* there for my children so that wont be an issue for them.

The easiest way not to leave a trail, of course, is not to leave one, so making her swallow is ideal.  It's still fun to sneak one on her face now and then, but then you have to help clean up.

In college, the stacks can work to your advantage if you're careful and discrete, and know when and where the stacks will be deserted.

What I don't understand is how a company as large as Riot can hire someone who has this much baggage following him.  It's important for consumers to believe in the leadership at the helm of their favorite ships, so hiring someone who inspires this much outrage and lack of support is a bit of a puzzling decision.  Living, breathing examples of leaders influencing and dictating how consumers buy are Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Walt Disney (and to a lesser extent Michael Eisner), Warren Buffet, etc.  You know who these people are from paying attention to news stories or listening to the radio, but you also know them from pop culture references in television (SNL, Mad TV, Conan, etc.) and film because their leadership qualities enable their reputations to transcend business and become a brand in and of itself.

The leadership's public image is very important because it dictates how the market will behave, either eager to spend (purchase RP, play for IP, etc) or unwilling to get their skin in the game (quitting, no RP purchase, foul mood, etc).  People buy Apple, Windows, IBM, etc. even in scenarios where their technology are not superior simply because of brand loyalty and trusting the leadership is one way to get that type of brand loyalty.

[Example 1](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/global/files/au__en_uk__ibm_exec_summary_empowered_consumer.pdf)
[Example 2](http://iveybusinessjournal.com/departments/from-the-dean/rebuilding-trust-the-integral-role-of-leadership-in-fostering-values-honesty-and-vision#.UtVBpp5dWIs)

aDDnTN,investing,1389708541.0,"&gt; Well isn't all investing just speculation?

no. investing is buying something with the purpose of selling it later for profit. speculating is thinking and considering the possible movements of securities. 

*investing in stocks* implies that you never sell until it's profitable. furthermore, it is implied that there are conditions that have to be met before you sell when investing. Goes over 500, you turn 65, etc.. You know you are investing, when you get excited and then make 1 largish buy, then forget about it for a few years. It's boring, there is very little to talk about, etc.

*speculation of stocks* implies you trade actively and don't hold anything very long. you make decisions about buying and selling based on market movements, volatility, patterns, etc. Speculators often have a ""system"" or ""method"". They often get new people on the hook by entrancing them with the romance of ""beating the market"" and ""fast profits and low risk"". 

Most people that *speculate* (day trade, short term trade, options, etc) properly invest a portion of their investments, while speculating (ruminating, more likely) about the future.

I put the parenthesis stuff in so that you can see the different usage of the word speculate and how most, if not all of them apply to investing, but they aren't the same thing exactly. One is an active action, the other is a passive action and introspective in nature."

BonzoTheBoss,DaystromInstitute,1389709044.0,"I think first of all we need to identify the objectives of the Romulan scientists that engineered phase cloak technology. What was their goal? Simply cloaking matter than can pass through other matter sounds (relatively) easy once you've got the basics of the interphasic cloaking technology in place. 

However in order to keep the military and Tal'shiar happy, it needs to have practical military and intelligence applications. This means you need to be able to scale the scope of your phase cloak, from anywhere to a entire starbase and all its personnel to an individual spy.

What are the practical obstacles faced with achieving these goals? Starting at the top with starbases, and starships, it sounds like a relatively simple objective to realise. If the whole structure and all it's associated systems (grav plating, life support, energy generation and distribution...) are all interphased at the same time, they should (theoretically) continue to interact with one another as normal. You may run into problems when you start running out of stored interphased matter for replication, anti-matter and oxygen for breathing (although Romulan starships use micro-singularities, so I'm not sure how they interact with the phase cloak) but you can stock up on those fairly easily, enough to only require coming into phase with the rest of space once every few months.

So what about the practical limitations of phase cloaking an individual? How do you stop them falling through the floor into space if they're aboard an enemy starship or into the core of a planet? How do they breath, or see, or eat?

To answer these questions I posit that a personal phase cloaker does more than simply shift your matter into an alternate interphasic dimension, it also applies a number of different persistent fields around your body as well so you can have some limited interaction with the universe. Let's start with the most pressing one, how to stop you from falling through the floor? I posit the phase cloaker covers you with a field of polarized interphasic gravitons, that interact with the gravitons of a mass field generated by gravity plating or the natural gravity well of a planet, causing resistance and thus preventing you from falling through the floor.

How do you breath? Or eat? We must examine what an interphasic rift *is* to understand how a humanoid can exist in one. Memory Alpha defines interphasic space as:

&gt;Spatial interphase, also known as interspace or an interphasic rift, was a phenomenon in which the fabric of space began to break up, allowing an overlap of parallel universes on different dimensional planes. The rift itself also contained a completely empty realm, devoid of life, between the dimensional planes. 

That to me implies a number of things. Either the scientists are able to focus the interphasic field to intersect a parallel domain wherein metabolic processes can be maintained on a mollecular level by merely interacting with it (where ATP is just kinetically floating and can penetrate your cells for use?), or the void field between dimensions creates a form of quantum statis of the cells so they no longer need to respire, but you retain a cyclic quantum energy so you continue to function. That isn't to say that there aren't downsides to this. We can hypothesize that prolonged time in an interphasic state can begin to cause celluar degredation at the quantum level, as see in ""TNG: Phantasms"". (True the celluar degredation in that episode was being caused by interphasic ""leeches"", but as we do not know what method they were using to interact with the crew's cells in normal space, I don't think it's a stretch)

How can you see? Well we know that light behaves in the same way in all frames of reference in our normal spatial dimensions, what's to say it doesn't behave the same across the interphasic spectrum as well? Light is light and can be used by your optical cells regardless of what phase you're in.

**TL;DR:** The Romulan Interphasic Cloaking Device doesn't just push matter into an interphasic rift, it targets the phasing and adapts a number of sub atomic fields to maintain life during interphase."

brain4breakfast,ShitAmericansSay,1389709065.0,"That infographic, though.

&gt;71.3% of young people in English speaking countries will hear the words 'dyke and 'faggot' every single day

b) So what? Words aren't bad in themselves. Being called anything in a derogatory manner is what you want to stop.

c) 'Every single day'? Do you want to put a limit on that?

The source for that information is apparently [another infographic](http://bigkingken.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lgbt-bullying-infographic.jpg), which uses the phrase:

&gt;71.3% of students hear homophobic remarks like 'dyke' or 'faggot' often or frequently.

a) 'Homophobic' is editorialising. Shouldn't be doing that in trying to present information.

b) 'Often or frequently' is awfully vague, and doesn't mean daily (so the first infographic deliberately changed the information)

c) 'Students' of where? The Fenway area? This doesn't mention English-Speaking Countries. Or anywhere at all. Incredibly vague.

d) Why the fuck is robinsonsrelo.com at the bottom of that infographic?! It's a property website!

You know, I wouldn't even go to that extent on Christians in the extreme west. 

Sure, there are some that are essentially ""culturally Christian""-- I'm a weak agnostic and I would say that my family has at least some degree of cultural Christian-ness, and more particularly culturally Catholic.

But I don't know-- Christians who don't attend Church on a regular basis and otherwise don't engage in a lot of Christian practises still don't equate to being basically atheistic, to my mind.

&gt; , but they seem to respect their religion to a bigger extent than I thought.

It's the same with the vast majority of the pro-secular/anti-conservative Islamist political parties and people through the region, I think.

Islam doesn't manifest itself as some strict way of life that has to factor into everything as with the conservative Islamists or the more aggressive groups of Salafis-- but it has a presence in some form, as in say engaging in worship or celebrating Islamic holidays or things similar to that.

In my state and county, if my ex is not available during her custodial time I'm legally the default person to take him before any of her family, friends, babysitters, etc. can step in.  And vice versa for her if I'm not available during my time.  I'm not saying this is the case for your niece, but it could be.  If so, her ex could be legally entitled to have his daughter 100% of the time that she's 'gone.  If you prevent that in any way, you and your sister could end up in big trouble.  On the flip side, you may be giving him time he's not entitled to while going against your sister's wishes.  Of course this is a separate issue from him actually staying in your sister's home.

I am not a lawyer, I don't know the laws in your state and country, and I don't know the details of your niece's custody order.  However neither are you, and you don't know.

Most school funding isn't federal.  It comes from the local or state levels.

&gt; You would get many people without kids in school spending $0 on education.

No - school taxes would remain the same, and public schools would get some basic level of funding regardless - but the majority of their funding would be based on the number of students enrolled in that school.  The idea isn't to change where the money to fund the schools originally comes from or how much there is, but rather how it is allocated.  There would be no check cut by the government to families with kids to spend how they like.  The schools would just receive funds based on enrollment.

Schools that provide a good education would get a bigger piece of the pie because more students would enroll there.  Schools that provide a poor education would get a smaller piece of the pie as students are moved to better schools.

Private schools couldn't be completely funded this way unless they were less expensive to run than public schools."

Renner1,worldnews,1389710591.0,"&gt; Any form of genocide is wrong.

That doesn't stop the people who talk about and continue to document the holocaust from very largely ignoring the Romas and Slavs who were killed off by the Sonderkommandos or the totenkopf units.

&gt; We learned about Roma and Slavic people being killed during the Holocaust as well. And I've been to the Holocaust museum in DC, and they do a very good job of explaining that many different groups of people were killed. 

That's surprising to hear, especially considering you live in the States. Mainstream Jewish orgs in Canada seem to think that they get a monopoly on grief and remembrance of genocide or something.

Of course, they all have to tie it in with unequivocal support for Zionism and anti-Arab sentiment as well.

&gt; People really shouldn't discuss their sex lives with others, unless they are close friends and they have a type of friendship where that's normal. 

That's good advice. The people who engage in the ""loud, aggressive, and proud"" LGBT activism should take it to heart.

&gt; The problem is, if you take freedoms away from Jihadis, Nazis, and Zionists, it might seem like a good idea at first, but who would be targeted next?

All three of these ideologies are based around disgusting attitudes towards other groups of people, sometimes on a large scale. 

That would effectively set the precedent for action by the state or law enforcement against them. Other groups who didn't act like that but otherwise engaged in agitation or aggressive behaviour would be treated differently and based off of exactly who they were and what exactly they do.

I'm no fan of anarchists or Bolsheviks, but it would really depend how they behaved-- take into consideration that both groups are largely ineffectual in society at this point.

&gt; Cross dressing and waving a rainbow flag doesn't hurt anyone. 

Those sorts of events are hardly as tame as just that, but it does shoot them in the foot when they're going for a state of normalcy or wider societal acceptance.

&gt; It's my understanding that the law bans all forms of open homosexuality, such as kissing someone of the same gender in public.

That's funny-- I understood the concept of ""homosexual propaganda"" was based around the loudest and most flamboyant demonstrations that had to do with ""LGBT Pride"". Which is a lot more upfront then two men holding hands or kissing.

 &gt; They consider it a mental problem? That's not a good sign. Almost everyone these days agrees that homosexuality is not a disease.

I can understand thinking that the ""gay pride"" mentality and the behaviour exhibited by some of the ""activists"" to be symptoms of some kind of mental disorder.

Two men who are gay and don't bring it up and don't plaster it front and centre everywhere they go, and focus on living the ""normal"" lifestyle?

That's completely different."

Your tax dollars wouldn't.  The tax dollars of the parents of the children in that private school would.

The only way your tax dollars might fund a private school is if you don't have children - in which case your tax dollars are currently funding public schools instead.

Why does it matter *which* schools they fund, if the end result is kids getting a better education?

&gt; &gt; Schools that provide a good education would get a bigger piece of the pie because more students would enroll there. Schools that provide a poor education would get a smaller piece of the pie as students are moved to better schools.

&gt; There needs to be a standard metric to measure that, otherwise, that means absolutely nothing.

The metric is the best one: whether the parents of those kids think they are getting a good education.  If they are completely free to move their kids to better schools on a year-by-year basis, then they can move the kids to wherever they believe is best.

We already know that letting bureaucrats determine what a good education is doesn't work - that's the system we have now."

First of all, like many other people who would call themselves ""pro-choice,"" I am not ""for abortion,"" I am against its across-the-board criminalization. I believe the number of abortions should be minimized, not by outlawing the practice and driving it underground, but by educating people about sex and making birth control available and accessible to everyone. That won't eliminate all abortions -- but neither will criminalization.  So I may well disagree with the Pope about the methods for reducing the number of abortions, but I don't disagree at all with his desire to do so.  His other statements placing the debates over abortion and other issues into a broader context matter to me, as well. 

Second, in the article, he is quoted speaking of abortion in the same breath as many other ways in which children (and adults) are devalued and discarded, which he is also calling for the world to address.  This is an important perspective that I am glad to see a church leader publicly advocating, and one generally missing when conservative politicians in the US start beating the abortion drum as part of their campaign propaganda. It is a lot easier to take seriously someone's concern for ""life"" when that concern embraces the full spectrum of humanity, and not one hot-button issue."

I_FUCK_UP_RECIPES,civ,1389712299.0,"Unrelated:

University of Planet has been and always will be the most OP civilization ever made in a firaxis game.  EVERY SINGLE ONE of its deficiencies can be fixed by secret projects (wonders)--specifically the virtual world.  It starts with the equivalent of a wonder (free improvement granting +50% research in all new bases AND ability to cash in the game's version of ruins for a free tech).  Virtual world makes that free improvement also reduce two drones in every city (unhappiness), removing the majority of your disadvantage and leaving something like an 80% research rate boost over other factions.  So there's no reason not to explosively expand.  

The other 'weakness' of the civ is its vulnerability to probe teams (spies).  Mid-game, you get a secret project (hunter-seeker algorithm) that makes all of your cities instantly destroy all enemy probe teams that attack them 100% of the time.  The expansion makes this a little better as an expensive probe team upgrade available even later gives them a chance (not a guarantee) to survive it.  

And there is one unit tech development--the copter--that completely unbalances combat.  It can attack over and over, and is an air unit so enemies can't fight back.  University will always get it first, and becomes basically unstoppable from then on.

I love Alpha Centauri--it remains better than any civ game for me due to the ability to customize units and design your own army with attack/defense/move/HP/special abilities, but you have to play as someone other than Zakharov to really appreciate it.  Too easy otherwise.

I don't see Fabled Hero doing anything significant in competitive Standard.

dreamingofjellyfish,TwoXChromosomes,1389712649.0,"&gt;Why is it ok for people to tell me what I should be doing? 

The times I told you what to do was saying use your anger to do something productive and to take the time to figure out what you believe and act on that. If you think that's bad advice you're certainly free to ignore it. the same applies to the church. You can take or leave what they say as you see fit. That basically applies to all advice, but unfortunately life will still be full of people saying what you can/should/must do.

&gt;Do you realize that talking about the Catholic church is for me like talking about an abuser? 

I'm very sorry you've had these experiences. A church however is not an individual but an institution. Though an institution can still be discriminatory and abusive. 

&gt;Can I ask you what impetus you had for responding as you did as if you know more about the Catholc church than say, someone who grew up in it? 

My point was that in an organization of roughly 1.2 billion people, not all of them are horrible.

&gt;You aren't just realist, you are someone who believes that religion is good for society, so even though you are an atheist, your actual stance is pro-theist. Why do you have to defend churches by minimizing what happened to me?

I am not pro-religion or pro-theist. Kindly stop putting words in my mouth. In general I think religion is misguided and the same benefits accomplished by religion could be accomplished with other drivers (same for the harm done). Basically I think religion can influence behavior but is largely a justification (people who want to do bad things will find justification in religion, and the same for people who want to do good things).

Nor did I intend to minimize your experience. I'm sorry for giving the impression I didn't take your experience with the seriousness it deserves.

I wanted to present an alternate view, which I think is valuable for debate. And I wanted to say this because I know some wonderful people, specifically women, who (strange though it is to me) are devoutly religious."

When cannons were imported, they became ubiquitous in Europe in just a decade or so (IIRC).

The most important one, by far, would be cavalry. If your civilizations don't have horses and you import some cavalry, that civilization will be able to wipe out any army in the open field that they could imagine. This is a technology, again, that was developed over centuries, but horse-riding was *so* potent, even in the modern era, that upon exposure to horses the Lakota Indians made it a central focus of their culture *within a generation.* The cavalry charge was the essential combat technique for *centuries.* While chariots and stirrups made your cavalry more awesome, a civilization without horses couldn't compete with one who has them."

aDDnTN,motorcycles,1389713029.0,"Tennessean here:

Doing 80 mph on the interstate in TN will only get you pulled over if any of the following is also true,

1) You are in one of the major cities (or Jackson).

2) You are tailgating, swerving, splitting lanes, or stunting AND THE COPS SEE YOU.

3) another driver CALLED IN on you and told the cops you were doing the above actions.

4) You are in a white rental van heading east or look ""ethnic"" heading west. Basically, drugs go east, cash goes west.

80-85mph is like maximum cruise for the rural sections of the interstates. If you start pushing 90 or go over it, you better hope the cop is lazy and already met his quota.

TN Troopers and Nashville/Knoxville/Blount Co cops seem to be cool with bikers, as long as both wheels are on the ground and you are staying in your lane. The rural locals and townie local cops are ALWAYS trouble. Sheriffs are cool, unless you set off their bad guy radar.

That exhaust is probably what ~~got~~ *might get* you pulled over in your car. 95% certainty, *if* the cops pulled you over*, it's* because they figure you've got drugs/cash because of the car and by exceeding the posted limit, you ~~gave~~ *would give* them an actual reason to pull you over.

BONUS: So some of the cops (Drug Task Force guys) have radar-detector detectors, so for them that's a good reason to suspect someone is doing illegal things, because in copthink, attempting to become informed about the location of police is suspicious behavior. then all they have to do is trump up some reason to pull you over.

This way you can keep your eyes on the navball and velocity indicator while intuitively gauging distance with your peripheral vision, instead of reading surface altitude from engineer.

&gt; After a few games without him, it's hard to argue that the team really does play as the captain goes. Koivu continually pushes pucks back into the corner, far away from the net, and routinely passes up shots and passes up clean entries, instead choosing to dump it in. Consequently the entire lineup did. Now without him, look at the goals scored yesterday and today. Three goals off the rush (not possible with Koivu's dump ins) and a couple feeds out front (not ever happening when Koivu just endlessly cycles in the corner). Simple solution, rid us of Koivu or at least put the 'C' on Parise's chest who better embodies a winning style of play and demote Koivu down to third line.

Shh, lets ignore the fact that he's still the team leader in points.

Another one:

&gt; While it is only been a few wins and a few days since Koivu has been out of the line-up, the Wild are now playing North American hockey and after all this is the NHL. European hockey is ""pretty"" on big ice but that style will NEVER win a Stanley Cup.

My MIL makes offhanded, catty comments but *nothing* like your customer. Edit to add: I'd like to think I'd seek out the manager and let him/her know how well you handled it.

One time she took us to a restaurant, and the server was pregnant. My MIL acted all charmed, ""Oh, when are you due?"". The server was clearly excited about the impending birth, and gave us a lot more detail than my MIL was prepared for (troubles with her boyfriend, physical issues). But my MIL asked things along the way, ""Is this your first? Do you have name ideas?"" Anyway, as the server walked away, my MIL rolled her eyes and stage-whispered, ""*Who cares?!*""

I'm pretty sure the server heard it, but even if she didn't, I was pissed. I said, ""You asked her about it, which is nosy to begin with. She's obviously looking forward to it! It's a big deal for her!"" I added a $20 bill to the tip - put it on top of the MIL's fair tip and gave her A Look (this was the Olive Garden, and we just got the soup/salad lunch thing). That was the worst infraction I've witnessed. Mostly it's just a snobby attitude toward servers which also pisses me off. 

I'm just so sorry people are like that. I don't understand. I've never been a server, because I don't have the skills for it, but I worked hotels (front desk) for 5/6 years, and have dealt with a lot of shitty, shitty people who forget that they're dealing with another human being.

Your word against mine. You wouldn't take a bigot at his word on his bigotry either. 

&gt;&gt;That's because your ideology condems all men, whatever they do.

&gt;Not true, mainly the societal stuff that harms women (and men)

Who is responsible for that and benefits from it, according to feminism?


&gt;There's a difference between a nice person and Somone who feels entitled to sex and is awkward

I don't see it. Wanting sex does not make you entitled, nor is awkwardness  a good reason to condemn someone. 

&gt;Weather or not somone is sexist depends on what counts a macho, you can be Macho without being sexist 

Wikipedia :""Machismo is the sense of being macho or manly, the concept associated with ""a strong sense of masculine pride...[with] the supreme valuation of characteristics culturally associated with the masculine and a denigration of characteristics associated with the feminine.""

If you give a kid attention when he does something he should not, you're rewarding him. If you reward an action, that action gets reinforced. A 2 year old is more than smart enough to see patterns and take advantage.

What we do whenever or 2 year old daughter does something she should not is put her in the corner, tell her why she is in the corner, and then totally ignore her for 2 minutes. After the time is up we pick her up, again explain why she was in the corner, and then tell her she can join is again. If she comes out of the corner before the time is up she gets put back.

Unless I'm really misunderstanding what you are saying, its quite simple to have a pro-gay marriage argument that doesn't involve being pro-beastiality.


Animals can not consent, therefore it is just cruelty to animals and beastiality should not be legal. Adult humans can consent, two consenting humans should be able to do whatever they want (including getting married) as long as it doesn't physically harm a third party.

GnuRip,worldnews,1389714496.0,"&gt; You do realize that you should have the same feeling every time you hold a knife right? Or a hammer?

Nope, shooting someone to death is much easier than stab/hammer one to death. Also shooting can be done over a quite big distance, while with a knife or hammer you have to be very close. Sure enough I handle sharp knife with care and only use them only for few things and don't carry them in public.

&gt;What is it about firearms that instill such fear in you while other tools don't have the same effect?

Guns are tools to hurt and kill, other tools aren't. Sure a Katana or Shuriken would also instill such a fear, and are banned in Germany which is good (imho). Still guns are even more powerful and so I am even more afraid of them. 

Sure there are people who have fun shooting at a Bullseye (or whatever those paper targets are called), but a less powerful gun that won't kill people would be just fine (even though I still don't like it, I would be ok with that)."

Start out with 6 drinks at my place to hit the sweet spot between a buzz and drunk. Went out to the club with a bunch of friends and I brought my sharpie with me. I had enough drinks there that my memory was a little fuzzy. Vaguely remember taking off my shirt, having 4+ LITs at the club, marking it on my arm, and wandering from my friends to dance with hilarious strangers. I'm pretty sure I made out with a decent looking girl at some point in the night, but clearly I was too hammered to bring her back to my place.

Wake up the next morning with a massive hangover and sharpie marks all over my body, shirt, and bed sheets. Names and numbers were scrawled on various parts of my body, but sufficiently smudged by the sweat and alcohol that I couldn't read it.

TL;DR: Night of heavy drinking and brought a sharpie to a club."

So, for example, the NA C9 team could be C9 Cirrus (though C9 Nimbus looks cool, too) instead of C9 NA and then EU C9 could be C9 Stratus instead of C9 EU.

Thoughts?

***Edit:***  I was saying Cirrus (higher altitude cloud) as the established team in NA and then Stratus (lower altitude cloud) as the newer amateur team in EU.

I like the sound of Nimbus for the NA team as an alternative to Cirrus, because Nimbus clouds are precipitation clouds and the NA C9 team definitely makes it rain on them hoes."

If you want a beer that's easier on the tongue, I recommend Shock Top. Their beers are generally sweeter, which makes them more palatable to a non-drinker. Raspberry Wheat is particularly light, while still being beer.

* Loot Pinata - a very easy/rudimentary boss - essentially, hit it a few times and get loot (Grobbulus was generally referred to as a loot pinata because most guilds once they beat patchwerk had no problem going and 1 or 2-shotting Grob right away)

* Lootship - term for the Gunship Battle Encounter in Icecrown Citadel (ICC) - referred to this way because very few groups/guilds ever wiped on this encounter, even on heroic - so it was pretty much just guaranteed loot for little effort

* Hunter Weapon - running joke from the old days of WoW where what weapons ""belonged"" to hunters wasn't really defined and they were able to use basically every class of weapons. This meant that they could ""legitimately"" roll on nearly any weapon that dropped. Leading people to joke that any weapon that dropped was a ""hunter weapon""

* Port - add to this one - not only the act of using a portal, but also the portal itself (ie. ""Looking for port to Dalaran"")

* PST - ""Please Send Telll"" used as shorthand for ""whisper me"". (some people actually read it as ""pst"" as in the noise made when trying to whisper/get someone's attention via whispers)

* WTB - might want to add - this is used as slang/shorthand for ""I want"" not necessarily denoting any actual transaction or sale. (ie. ""WTB this drop off Garrosh"" or ""WTB some luck tonight"")

* RNG - ""Random Number Generator"" shorthand used to refer to any random occurrence, or the results of such. For example, when not getting any loot via /roll ""RNG hates me tonight"". Or when getting hit repeatedly by a boss with a random ability ""Wow, some RNG"". 

* under Pally BoP/HoP - might want to add in here, all of the ""Hand of"" spells can be referred to as ""HoSpell"" or ""BoSpell"" the ""Bo"" part comes from before the Paladin redesign, when those spells were ""Blessing of Protection"" or ""Blessing of Salvation"" instead of Hands (this was changed at the redesign that came at the beginning of Wrath of the Lich King)

* Bubble/Hearth - the act of casting the Pally Bubble (Divine Shield) that gives full immunity, then using that immunity to cast your hearthstone. This has been done to great hilarity in some situations such as: setting your hearth in a nearby inn and using bubble/hearth while dueling, bubble/hearthing during a raid boss wipe instead of staying around and dying, etc

* 969 rotation - not used as it no longer applies, but it was a rotation used by Prot Pallys during Wrath of the Lich King. Prot Pallys at that time had 2 ""classes"" of instant spells, some with a 6 second cooldown, some with a 9 second cooldown. Basically, this referred to a rotation of alternating between 6 and 9 second cooldown abilities back and forth, guaranteeing that you would basically always have some ability available when your global cooldown is up. 

* PvE (can also be player vs enemy - this is actually generally the more used version I believe - enemy here referring to NPC enemies)

It prolly had something to do with me doing 5 lines with absolutely no idea of how strong it was because the first time i did like half a line."

Drink when you are thirsty.  You will be fine.

tf2honeybadger,robotics,1389715220.0,"Huh, that's an interesting way of doing it. Does the threaded rod in the middle wiggle around when the motor spins, though? It looks like it's held in the center by those two or three small nuts, but the end of the device doesn't have anything to keep it in the center. "
benk4,explainlikeimfive,1389715226.0,To me it's plain on the video.  They talk about choking him out.  That right there shows me that their intent was to harm him in to submission.  Unless we accept that the officer is stupid enough to think that choking can't kill someone.  
Miss_anthropyy,TumblrInAction,1389715232.0,So good. ;)

hisherry,thesopranos,1389715271.0,"Your point is right on!  Oranges, in many ways (not just as whole fruit), are used throughout the series to foreshadow death.  Syracuse basketball is mentioned as losing right before they announce the death of Paulie's ma and right after Christopher dies.  Ralph brings Tony a bag of oranges early in the season where Tony kills him.  Tony, and other Soprano family members, are seen drinking OJ before deaths in episodes - though Tony drinks OJ a lot throughout the series, so I'm sure there are instances that aren't used as foreshadowing.  Vito is also compared to OJ Simpson right before his death."
