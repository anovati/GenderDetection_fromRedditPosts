Not to mention how often she gets hit on by randoms (not necessarily cold-approached, but that happens too)

UlgraTheTerrible,LongDistance,1390918401.0,"Fact is sweetpea, *you* are the one that has a dream version of her in your head. She... Well... She sounds *incredibly* immature, emotionally and psychologically. Hardly perfect. 

So here is the best I can give you... 

It is okay to love and mourn the woman you loved... But realize I write that in the past tense, because you're just now dealing with learning that the woman you love doesn't exist, and worse, now there is a she-demon wearing her face and feeding on your misery, playing with your heartstrings. 

You need to learn to hate this she-demon, for the sake of your self-worth and sanity. And I *think* (I don't know) that you need to go home. Somewhere where you are surrounded by people who love you unconditionally. Somewhere with family, blood or bond, but with family. There *is* the option of staying and making a go of it, but I think you should only do this if you can guarantee that you'll never see the she-demon again, and only if you actually dream of life in America, and only if there is nowhere safe and loving for you to go instead. Give yourself a few days to figure it out. 

After a blow like this, it would probably be *wise* to take a break from love and focus solely on self-improvement, but it's going to be *hard* not to fall into the first warm bed that becomes available after a blow to the self-confidence like this. 

And no, you have nothing to feel bad about. You're gorgeous. (Bit young for my tastes, but attractive).. You seem really sweet and caring, if a bit naive. 

But please, *please* don't fall for her bullshit anymore. That's what the ""perfect"" is... Bullshit. She's not the way she pretends to be. That's just the mask. That's the ""good"" behavior. Underneath it, she's pure ugly. Her soul is a writhing mass of worms and decay. 

See, some people will do that... Pretend that their soul is shiny and beautiful and we'll fall in love with that... And the worst part is, it's very hard to tell the difference between those ones, and the other ones, who show their *real* souls... But there are warning signs. We call them ""red flags""... And the best you can do is watch for them while not being afraid to love again. 

I'm sorry you've had to go through this, but do know... I've been in a similar situation. When you get through this (and you *will* get through it)... You will be stronger, one way or the other. Do try not to become harsh or cruel because of this... Some people do, and it's the worst tragedy of all. Try to retain your hope and faith in true love and genuinely *good* people being out there, I promise, they are out there. 

I know it hurts now... But everything will be okay. You may be physically weak, but your being is strong. It has to be, to survive a LDR, even if it doesn't end well. Try to remember how strong you are. You'll need it, but everything will be okay, and everything will work out for you... It just might take more time than you were initially expecting. 

Good luck. "

SwatchVineyard,GakiNoTsukai,1390918457.0,"I can teach you how to make your own ringtone so that you can find your desired clip as well as make any type of ringtone you want in the future.


* 1. Look up a batsu video on youtube with [0min &lt; time &lt; 5min] with good quality and the combination of ""Out"" that you are looking for
* 2. Copy the link for the video you like and go to (www.youtube-mp3.org)
* 3. Paste the link in and click ""convert"" and press download when it's done converting
      * *This gives you the audio file from the video you just downloaded*
* 4. Now go to (www.audiko.net)
      * *You don't have to create an account at first because the let you make about 3 ringtones before you need to make an account, but I recommend making one anyway, because this way your ringtones are saved and if you wish to use this method to make more than 3 ringtones you already have an account for the future and can re-download and share your ringtones.*
* 5. Follow the instructions on the site and upload the audio that you downloaded from the previous website. 
      * *Notice that you can also choose the ""enter an URL"" option to skip steps 1 - 3, but I included them so that you can do this with audio files on your computer or if you wish to keep the full audio of the video you convert, if you get where I am heading here. Two birds, one stone.*
* 6. Edit the audio to make the ringtone you desire
     * *Pan through the audio by dragging the the shadow on the second line and find the snippet you wish to make as your ringtone within the shadowed region by dragging the blue box on the first line. You can shorten the length of recording by re-sizing the sides of the blue box on the first line. You can also add or remove a fade the beginning or the end of the ringtone clip by clicking the respective check-boxes in the blue box.* 
* 7. When you're done just select ""create ringtone"" and select the option to download it to your computer and email/wire it directly to your phone, or send it to yourself. 

It's a lot to read through, but the process takes less than 3 minutes once you get to it. Now you can make a ringtone using the audio of any Youtube video or downloded audio file that you want..

Hope this helps other people. Its the safes way you can make and/or download ringtones with paying or subscribing yourself to gimmicks and spam.

werewolfchow,Games,1390918460.0,"The thing with eve, which you are completely wrong about, is that there aren't any real ""career paths"". They market that way because it's easier than explaining the truth, but in fact Eve is a big sandbox, and you can do anything, and any combination of things that you want.

Still, it is easier to get good at something if you train skills for only that, but I have 2 accounts, and my main character does mission running, small-gang pvp, solo pvp, exploration, and planetary interaction. My other character does mining, hauling, and manufacturing, and I am training him up to be a capital ship pilot.

The sandbox is what makes Eve great. The fact that this battle can happen is precisely because you can do whatever you want.

When CCP first added Titans to the game, they never thought players would be able to build them without intense organization. They expected them to remain rare. The first player-built Titan (and the first destroyed) was named Steve, and his wreck is still preserved in space.

But now, since players decided they really wanted a bunch of titans, have created tons of them, and throw them around like this resulting in amazing, publicity-gaining battles.

But if you want to just train for two weeks and blow up miners in a destroyer, you can do that, too.

aDDnTN,MechanicAdvice,1390918762.0,"please tell me it's not an SX (turbo)? 

yeah, you can kill an engine running it without oil. ~~What's odd is i would have thought the oil pressure light would have come on before then.~~ IMO, double gasket didn't leak right away but eventually did and you pumped all your oil out after filtering it. damn!

---------

But you are basically explaining why i change my own oil and use **OEM filters**, which is one of the major basic requirements of the warranty.

imo, that's why they won't replace your motor or do any work. they want to see that you either were using a Kia OEM oil filter (as required in the warranty and specified in the owners manual) or when you bring them a generic part, they can point at it and say ""warranty void"". 

----------

The reason they insist on OEM oil filters is that their OEM part comes with a check valve, that prevents oil from draining out of the turbo, engine passages, and head when the engine is off. It preserves those vital parts and helps deal with heat once the engine is off, plus there is lubricant in the upper system and turbo during start-up which is quite necessary for the parts to last.

i always visually verify that the old gasket is entire off the engine. i even keep the old filters in case there is an issue later on. I have had to scrap some gasket residue off to ensure a good fit. I also always fill my filters with oil before installing and ensure that the new gasket is coated with oil. i use 5w-30 RP full synth, which the service guy says is good. I also use techron (which they advise now) and OEM engine air cleaners (which i also save).

---------

bummer man. that just sucks. imo, it's firestone's fault, but that is a seriously scummy company regardless of how good or bad their techs are, i would never bring ANYTHING to them anymore. 

This is your problem now though. Should have read the owners manual (OEM oil filters specifically mentioned there). I hope you can get firestone to step up, that is who i would have my lawyer send nasty letters too. But KIA won't uphold your warranty until you verify that you did, which is gonna be hard to do, since you didn't follow their instructions.

For future notice, even if you don't have a CEL if your oil light comes on or your temp gauge goes up more than 2/3 of the distance between C and H, you should pull over, stop the engine immediately and call for a tow. Even if you can't tell from inside or outside, something major is wrong and further driving will cost you MUCH MORE in the long run."

Cocofang,DotA2,1390919071.0,"I would have remade him differently.

- Stun to Rolling Boulder (1.75/2/2.25/2.5), Slow to Grip.
- 5 Remnants max storeage with 30 seconds recharge, but no maximum of remnants placed (which matters because they last 120 seconds. Emphasises the ""planning-ahead"" part)
- Don't fix the distance bug on rolling boulder and make it a feature instead (it allowed to trade speed for distance (which would have been alot more important with Stun on Rollling Boulder)) But travel range upon hitting a remnant would be 1200 (instead of 1600).
- Fixing stun interactions on boulder is obvious (stun canceling it) But I would just add a minor defensive boost to rolling boulder (10%/15/20%/25 reduced damage taken while in boulder form) mostly to fit its flavor text)
- Due to stone boosted boulder now stunning you no longer pop out on the other side of the enemy hero. Now you have to move around him yourself. Popping out on the other side of the hero also looked buggy as hell anyway.
- Remove the silence/slow sharing part of the Ultimate and put it on an Aghs upgrade (which also shares the stun though)

Most importantly though that would have made his most difficult combo more viable:
Place Remnant --&gt; Skillshot it into them --&gt; Grip it while its flying --&gt; Roll over it (requires only one stone, but has been unviable beforehand [and currently] due to the stacking of the stun and the silence, while it now would stack the slow and the silence mostly.)"

AKA_Sotof,Denmark,1390919203.0,"&gt;Jeg synes ikke, det er tåbeligt at være religiøs. Det er ikke noget jeg siger, fordi jeg er religiøs, for det er jeg ikke. Jeg siger det, fordi der findes milliarder af religiøse mennesker verden over, der ikke er fundamentalistiske, og som formår at leve et godt liv, der ingen konsekvenser har for dig som ateist. 

Bare fordi mange er det, så betyder det ikke at det ikke er tåbeligt.

&gt;Religiøse mennesker lever på en anden måde - eller snarere med et andet verdenssyn end du - og det er der intet i vejen med. At du synes det er forkert og fjollet kan du godt synes, men så hold det for dig selv i stedet for at tro, at du er meget bedre end alle religiøse. Det at du synes, det er i orden at nedgøre nogen, du er uenige med, og som lever på en anderledes måde, synes jeg ikke er i orden. 

Du har fuldkommen mistet tråden her. Det har intet at gøre med at nedgøre dem. Det har alt at gøre med at være ærlig. Jeg holder det ikke for mig selv da de religiøse mennesker ikke gør det. Der en forskel mellem at sige 'hold kæft med jeres tåbelige mytologi' og 'Tro på vores gud eller ryg i helved'. Jeg laver blot en respons til deres nonsens.

&gt;Du har da ret i, at mange fundamentalister og andre ekstremister er religiøse, og jeg har heller ikke lyst til, at de skal komme her og forkynde deres religion i Danmark.

Godt, så er vi enige. Hvad er problemet så?

&gt;Dem vil jeg da hellere have her i Danmark, end folk der ikke accepterer og respekterer andre, end folk præcis som dem selv.

I've been pumping and supplementing with BM and formula since 3 months when my daughter stopped gaining weight and was adamantly still hungry after breastfeeding (screaming inconsolably). After a week of following advice like ""keep offering the breast,"" ""if she is hungry she will keep sucking,"" etc etc I realized nothing was improving. I pumped like CRAZY trying to up my supply, and it helped a little, but we still have to give a bottle to supplement at least two feeds a day at 4 months. I gave her formula for the first time about 3 weeks ago because even supplementing all the BM I could pump wasn't enough for her.

Nobody has given me a medical reason or anything but I wonder if my flow is just too slow to satisfy her. Breastfeeding has never calmed my baby, it actually gets her really worked up and agitated because she has to work so hard. My mom went through the same thing with me and is encouraging me to switch to formula entirely. My original goal was to BF for at least 6 months but I'm thinking of stopping sooner... I don't know. 

Right now the only thing that's stopping me is the fact that she often wakes up at 5 am, and I feed her and she goes back to sleep. I don't want to deal with a bottle then!! Le sigh. I wish this was easier... I wish my boobs worked the way they're supposed to."

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1390920152.0,"Basically, the issue is updrafting. Hail forms by water droplets freezing, but then gusts blow the hail up, and as it moves it accumulated more droplets, making larger hail. The hail falls out when the gusts aren't strong enough to buffet it back up. To get very large hailstones you need extremely strong winds and an extremely large stormcloud.

In a world like Earth, no, it's not even remotely possible. The one imaginable solution besides winds-that-can-remove-limbs would be to massively increase the possible water density of the atmosphere. Different atmospheric compositions will increase the moisture holding capacity. More water, more droplets accumulate faster. That being said, I'm not a chemist - I don't know what the limits on this would be or how to form a planet that has that kind of atmosphere."

spongemonster,Games,1390920196.0,"Sov block warfare is often about the bigger picture.  The fleet ""peons"" are not doing anything overly complex, and it's certainly not the best example of entertaining pvp.

The best pvp (IMO) is small gang and solo combat.  1-15 people in a fleet engaging either equal or greater numbers.  It's exciting, it's often complex, (especially shield HAC kiting gangs vs larger enemy fleets) and the kills/combat is infinitely more personally rewarding than massive sov block engagements.

There are few things more rewarding in eve than entering enemy sov block territory with a 10 man HAC kite gang, engaging a 50 man defense fleet, killing half of them in several small hectic engagements, then escaping to safety with minimal (or no) losses.  Huge 1000 man engagements are epic, but not always fun, at least not for me."

If you are consistent, your reputation will proceed you and it will be less work for you in the future (as far as classroom management).  Also, if you need to address the whole class, do not talk until the room is quiet.  You will never get their attention if you talk while it is noisy.  A good substitute is always in demand and gets the best sub positions.  

* If the teacher leaves a seating chart, use it.  If not, quickly pass around a sheet of paper (with classroom layout) and have kids sign in.  You'll be happier when you know who everyone is.  
* Taking the attendance to the office is a special treat.  Use this power wisely.  Do not let more than one student go to the office at a time.  
* Keep a list of the good kids (helpful, on task, respectful) and the bad kids (off-task, rude, not following directions).  The teacher will appreciate knowing what happened.  
* Keep a log of what you do for each class.  Most teachers (I hope) leave lesson plans.  Check off what you do.  Leave a note about each class/subject (ex: we did the warm up and the video, but only got halfway through the discussion.  Jimmy R. and Shaunice were helpful, Candice and Sam were not working.).  
* Don't be afraid to send students to the classroom next door for a time out, or to the office with a referral.  If the kids realize they won't get in trouble with you, they will start to take advantage.  "

My boyfriend doesn't watch porn (on purpose, reddit doesn't appear to count) now that he's with me. Or maybe he does but says that to feel like he's getting away with something. Lord only knows what he does when I'm not around. 

*I* don't mind him watching, and he doesn't mind me watching, but he says he kinda feels like he's cheating. 

So maybe, *just maybe*, you don't get to decide what other people feel about porn, watching it, and the place it does or does not have in other people's relationships. 

However, your friends shouldn't really treat you like your preference is weird or anything... But technically, porn is cheating if they feel like it's cheating.

Fimbultyr,AskMen,1390921056.0,"While I'm all for comparisons between myself and vikings, they actually had hairstyles that were long in the front and short in the back, from what I've read. That being said, I have hair roughly down to my nipples, though I've had it down past my rib cage before (I occasionally donate mine). I like it, and many people agree. I've had girls tell me that I have nicer hair and they're jealous of me, and a lot of dudes who used to have long hair but had to cut it have good things to say about it as well. I don't do well with women by anyone's standards, but I think that's less to do with the hair and more to do with having a fair bit of social anxiety and being oblivious to interest. I certainly get more attention now than I ever did with short hair, drunk girls occasionally want to play with it/braid it.

I mainly keep it because it's one of the few parts of my appearance I genuinely like. It's a bit of work, but when my hair is short it has a mind of it's own so short hair is almost as much work for me. I mean, no guy should have to go to the same lengths as women do to keep their hair nice, because women are constantly damaging theirs with straightening, curling, bleaching, dyeing, etc. Since you aren't fighting all of that, as long as you keep it clean and conditioned, avoid daily shampoo use, and try to let it dry first before brushing it out, long hair is easy to keep nice looking."

You did this one 10 hours ago. You got responses but didn't like them. 


OP your answers are as follows:

* No she probably didn't, but it doesn't matter. She's willing to try and make you jealous in crazy ways indicates more than your immature self is willing/capable of handling
* This was not a decent response. In fact neither of you have made a decent response this whole time. If you wanted a girlfriend you should have asked her to be exclusive with you. End of story.
* No I would not GF her in your shoes. In fact, you seemed more intrigued by the sex and her money they you did about the actual girl or even the actual relationship. Seriously your line
&gt;Now, here’s the honest truth, I hate having to work my ass off to hook up with a girl. I’d love to have a steady girlfriend, and Lisa can be a cool chick

spongemonster,Games,1390922784.0,"Depends on a lot of factors.  There's a lot of different ways to engage enemies and it all varies depending on:

* what you're flying
* are you alone or with a gang
* is it sov block warfare
* are they alone
* what's your engagement range
* what weapons are you using
* etc.

Without more details about your fight I'm thinking you're were either referring to sov block warfare, or a pretty basic fight.  Yea, there are ships where you simply catch the target, turn on tackle, turn on guns,  and wait for either you or the other guy to die.  That's pretty much how I used to fly my taranis a few years back.

But things are a little different if you're in say, a navy slicer vs a dramiel.  We'll say the dram is a dual prop shield fit, and the slicer is standard pulse kite fit with an SAAR.  Frig fights are some of the hardest fights in eve.  They can be so fast and have such (relatively) small tanks that the fight can be decided in the first few seconds of the engagement.  Here it goes.  

------------
The dramiel's advantages are good tank, great dps, great speed (provided it's fitted right).  The slicer pilots advantage is good damage types vs shields, good speed, and good dps and damn good dmage projection (solid dps with scorch out to 20-25km).  Since the dram isn't active tanking it needs to get up close and finish the fight fast in order to survive.  The slicer needs to stretch the engagement for as long as possible and prevent the dramiel getting into scram range.  Once the dram gets within scram range and shuts down the slicer's mwd, it'll be a race to see who runs out of hitpoints sooner.

In order to survive, the slicer needs to try and force the dramiel into a chase, so it'll attempt to pull range and whittle away at the dramiel's tank as much as it can as the dramiel tries to catch up and get within scram range.  The dramiel pilot can either chase in the hopes of catching the slicer before his own tank drops too low, or he can choose to turn around burn in the opposite direction and hope the slicer wants to risk chasing to finish off the kill.  If he chooses to continue chasing the slicer he needs to get in scram range, shut down the slicer's mobility and overheat like crazy to try and kill the slicer.  The dramiel can probably try to esablish a tight, fast orbit to mitigate *some* of the slicers close range dps, as slicers can sometimes have tracking issues up close.  If the slicer gets tackled it's going to switch to close range ammo (for better damage and tracking) and try damn hard to burn in a direction that stops the dramiel from establishing a stable, tight orbit.  If the dram does manage a tight orbit, the slicer may not be able to apply full dps.  The use of conflagration ammo is an option if the dramiel decides to get close and maintain no orbit, but that's not common behavior for a dram up close vs a slicer.  If this all happens it's a race against time and tanks.  The slicer hopes it whittled away enough of the dramiel's tank at a distance that it can finish it off up close.  The dramiel hopes that enough of its tank is left to finish off the slicer up close without dying.  It can perhaps experiment with using barrage and moving in and out of the slicer's close range ammo optimals to force the slicer to stop shooting for a moment while it switches ammo, but that tactic is at the risk of using a lower damage ammo at various ranges (barrage), rather than a high damage ammo at close range.

If the dramiel chooses option two and decides it doesn't want to chase the slicer and burn away instead, it hopes the slicer will be blood-thirsty enough to turn around and try and get back in long point range of the dramiel.  But the slicer needs to be very careful, if it burns directly at the dramiel, it risks falling for a faint - the dramiel could have been pretending to withdraw in the hopes of drawing the slicer closer.  Once the slicer builds up inertia in a specific direction, it can take a bit longer to turn around again.  In the time it takes to turn around, the dramiel might be able to get into scram range.  So as the slicer moves closer it needs to pay close attention to the range, speed, and direction the dramiel is moving.  The moment the dramiel starts turning around is the moment the slicer needs to turn its butt around too.  Too late and the dramiel can catch the slicer, too soon and the dramiel will turn and burn away again.

It's like a chess game, but in fast-forward.  And this isn't even including the moments before the fight starts when the pilots are looking at the weapons either ship has fitted, the top speeds their opponents are moving at, the allies of the opponents in local, perhaps even the killboards of each other.  All of this taking place within the seconds before the fight even starts, just to gain intel and perhaps an edge on their opponent.

So yea, sometimes the fights are simple enough to get close, turn on guns, and wait for an explosion.  And sometimes it's a complicated dance between two badass motherfuckers on the prowl for a kill."

I wasn't going to say anything because I've seen firsthand that dropping out isn't necessarily the kiss of death everyone thinks it is, but I didn't want to be seen as *supporting* that decision.

But if you have to be homeschooled for that diploma, honestly I can see how that might be too much for you to bear. AND there's the practical application: Sure, you'll have an official diploma, but the life experience associated with homeschooling versus the real world is miles apart.

If you're motivated enough, you can make dropping out work for you. But be prepared to grit your teeth and get through some tough times. If it's tough being at home and putting on a false front, it's not all rainbows and unicorns out here without a diploma.

Maybe it would take years for me to forget her and move on.

I would recommend you now, (if you want to forget him, and move on), don't talk about him with your friends, don't listen to songs that bring memories of you two or movies. If you get yourself thinking about him, just start doing something else, watch a video, change the song, talk about some different subject. It might take weeks or months until you finally forget him and be able to stand up to start something new.

One of the reasons I could try to guess is that he really did not like you, and maybe he was trying to see if he could get along, idk, just guessing. Every man is a world, so you might never find a real answer unless you ask him but that would be extremely painful right now."

Maybe the pivotal factor is taking a break from each other for a few months to ""reset"" everything. Low-sex relationships are inherently more bloodless than high-passion ones, so your chances are good.

It also helps if you've both moved on; I haven't been able to keep close with my LL ex unfortunately, because he hasn't been in a relationship since the divorce a decade ago, and my husband and I are on our third child. It just doesn't work.

As for your pets: maybe it seems like an inextricable entanglement right now, but it really, really isn't. It'll be unfortunate and awkward and difficult like all breakups are... but it'll be *nothing* like a divorce, and focusing on your sunk costs (see ""[sunk costs fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs)"") is the opposite of what will help.

&gt;Tired of feeling desperate, feeling masculine, feeling repulsive and pathetic; tired of having the talk time and time again only to see the results fade into dust...

My ex had this infuriating habit of overpromising and underdelivering, because he literally forgot my complaints once the screaming stopped. And he used to flirt shamelessly with me in front of an audience, and then completely drop it once we were alone and he could actually do something about it. Even though we'd fought about his drive (sexual and otherwise) since before getting married, he was still completely shocked when I finally left. And me, I went from an eager, gutsy, shame-free initiator to someone who had to be exclusively aggressively pursued *for literally years* until I got back ahold of myself.

lorelei_,bisexual,1390923342.0,"&gt;Well part of the thing behind it (I'm working on not having this prejudice myself if I'm going to be honest) is that for a lot of us when we were coming out (or attempting) the first assumption put on us is that we COULDN'T be monogamous, and I think that assumption still exists a lot outside of the ""Bi"" community. So as a monogamous person that's trying to say hey yes I can be Bi and monogamous, it's hard when we meet other people who are Bi who are ""proving the stereotypes"".

Whilst I don't necessarily agree with prejudice against the poly community, this explanation makes a lot of sense - not that that makes it justified or anything.

What you don't realize is that as a school in our place in the CFB world, we acknowledge that we don't really have a shot at the 4- and 5-star prospects more often than not. That means we have to rely on talent evaluation for all of the 2- and 3-stars who don't get attention from the big boys. So while you're off going after Lorenzo Carter and other huge recruits nationally, we're not going to kid ourselves. We're going after Brendan Douglas and Will Adams, thinking we've found diamonds in the rough. Which we have. Except then these big boy recruits commit somewhere that's not your school, and you're left picking up scraps. And where do you go? Georgia Tech's recruiting class (among others) -- all those kids that your fanbase mocked for their lacking offer sheet when they committed to us, are now one of the best guys left in Georgia. Next thing you know, even though they're committed and ""solid, 100%"" to us for months on end, they're taking visits and flipping to uga and Auburn, all the while leaving us in the dust. See, for months, we thought we had the guy we wanted at RB or OL. We may have passed on other guys who popped up because we had already invested in our guys, and had given them our word that we were committed to them. So now, you have our A-list guys, and our B-list guys are elsewhere too. Next thing you know, we're short on talent as compared to most of our opponents, and we're ridiculed for being a mediocre program.

And yet you think Paul Johnson should just let them run around visiting anywhere like the Wild West? Give me a fucking break. His policies are the only way we have of competing with the big boys of the CFB world.

phaqueue,woweconomy,1390923796.0,"I play on a high-pop server myself. I make gold through all the ""normal"" means people post about. (GIO shuffle, enchants, glyphs)

There are a couple of things about high-pop servers. 

* Yes, there are more people producing things, so you have more competition for sales and prices will be generally lower.

* This also means that prices for materials are generally lower. I get ghost iron for cheaper than on low pop servers generally, as more people are farming it on my server.

* Generally, you will make less profit per sale, but will have more sales overall. This tends to even out. While a scribe on a low pop server might sell 50 glyphs in a week but make 30g per, I might sell more like 250 but only make 6g per. It evens out to the same thing, I just have to sell more to do it. 

I came back to the game ~2 months ago and since then I've gone from under 10k gold (I wanna say around 6-8k or so I forget exactly how much I had when I came back though :( ) to around 55k liquid (and another probably 20-30k in inventory). 

One fun way to make gold between the two is pets. I was doing this between my main Alliance server (high-pop) and a low-pop horde server I happened to have an alt on. Some examples:

* Bought a Hyacinth Macaw for 2k on main server, learned it and caged on horde server and sold for over 8k.

* Sold off multiple pet drops from old raids (BWL, AQ, etc) that I got while doing those raids for transmog. They sold slower, but for a MUCH bigger profit on my low-pop horde server (about 10x the price for most pets)

I chose to transfer/faction change the character to get the gold to my main server (bought a few choice pieces cheap to resell for profit as well) - I had planned to do this from the beginning because I wanted to bring this character over eventually, and just kind of took advantage of the situation. 

You can, however, just use this to fund an alt server you plan to play on, or use pets to xfer the gold back (might need to find more rare ones to be able to not lose a lot in the exchange back)

Also, make sure you're using the undermine journal great deals page, especially for your low-pop server, there will generally be fewer people camping for those deals. I was able to buy the warlock green fire book on my low-pop server for 1k gold and flip it for 8k in under a week. 

Hope this helps!"

UlgraTheTerrible,confession,1390924369.0,"Well, as I understand it, ""Judge not lest ye be judged"" is *supposed* to cover this, but the fact is, a lot of people are hypocrites... 

Try to remember that while you're busy looking down on others, there are people looking down on you right back. 

Take me, for example. I'm Buddhist. I try not to look down on people, but sometimes I can't help thinking ""Am I surrounded by spiritual *children* here, or what?""

Fact is, we think these things. It happens. Some.. *discernment* about the company we keep is positive... But like every somewhat positive trait we have, *too much* is often a huge psychosocial problem. 

The trick, I think, is some awareness of what we're doing and gentle correction of those thoughts... For me, this translates to, ""Well, maybe they *are* spiritual children, but they have their path, and must learn their lessons, and you don't treat children as *lesser* beings, you just try to guide them a little bit and let them learn at their own pace.""

So you temper the judgement with a *kind* thought afterwards, and try not to let it affect how you *act* towards people. Which isn't always something I'm successful at, but the attempt is, I think, worthwhile. "

I grew up around them and they're my current career.  I think a lot of the phobia associated with firearms springs from a staggering ignorance about them.

I have a lot of hardcore liberal (I'm liberal too) friends who *hate* guns for no particular reason other than they're 'bad.' I try to invite them in small groups out to the range, give a small presentation about how they work, and extensively review safety protocols with them.  Then I let them shoot ARs, AKs, pistols, rifles, etc.  Whatever they want.

I'm not necessarily out to change their mind, but I'd much rather they be opposed to firearms while having practical experience with them, rather than spouting naive rhetoric.

Dystaxia,ADHD,1390925676.0,"Your concern is commendable and a very healthy way to approach the issue. I waited until I was familiar with the effects of bupropion on my body and when I decided to try drinking, I started very slowly. With some medications, I notice that certain effects of alcohol intoxication present themselves differently; you may not notice certain effects while others may be amplified. It's like learning to drink responsibly all over again. Start slow and be extra mindful.

With stimulant medication and bupropion to a lesser extent, I would notice less effects of physical disorientation but I would still be getting progressively intoxicated. I'd have to mind more attention to the amount I'm consuming rather than how I feel in reference to past experiences of finding my limit. Certain signs you may rely on to meter your usage may not be present.

I would probably have a beer or two one night and see how it goes, see how it effects you now - what's different and what's the same. Tread cautiously and really pay attention to how you feel."

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1390925694.0,"I have so much love for Lisa Eldridge. I like her tutorials (generally in video form and she also occasionally does blog posts) because I find them accessible to any skill level. She has an excellent selection of basics where she explains why you would use (or wouldn't) use a certain product. I also really appreciate that she's sensitive to the fact that not everyone does makeup professionally and therefore does not have the same collection of items so she recommends various high street/drugstore alternatives. 

I think the best advice I learned from her is to match your foundation to your jawline since you can sometimes have redness or discoloration in your face, or maybe your face is just much darker than your neck. Both apply to me and I'd been wearing foundation that always seemed off to me despite it matching perfectly to my cheek. 

Otherwise, some of my favorite blogs include Drivel About Frivol and Sweet Makeup Temptations. They normally review things that are out of my budget, but I find that they're some of the most thorough reviewers (to be honest, you can also just call them picky but I like that) and have taught me about what to look for when buying products even at the drugstore price point.

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1390925844.0,"You're right, my comment was phrased poorly, but I was throwing out that there are lots of different theories that do relate aspects of human sexuality to the emotion jealousy, and that also relates the idea that a moderate amount of jealousy expressed in a healthy way can create greater sexual (and possibly romantic) attraction between partners.

I think that the emotion of jealousy is treated too negatively in poly far too often.  I can think of many cases of moderate flirting/teasing to consensually stir a twinge of jealousy that can be quite healthy and fun between couples.  The problem would be if it's done in a manipulative manner or to ""punish"" a partner for some perceived slight.

Young men are known for being quite jealous in relationships as well - really age and gender has little to do with it.  I saw your point, you were equating something frivolous and manipulative to teenage girls.  I think that's a bit sexist.

That being said, Daft Punk *has* been mainstream for years. I'm happy Guy and Thomas struck it big, RAM was an incredible album in a number of different ways, even if you didn't like the music there is so much to it just technically that makes it worthy of the award.

Specifically, what are you confused about? I'm honestly not entirely sure how you're confused about how to interpret the dots but here's how:  

* Light dots = color lighter than your skin tone, highlighter or luminizer  
* Dark dots = color darker than your skin tone, contouring powder (or matte bronzer/cream pigment/what-have-you)  
* Pink/red dots = blush  

Apply each to your face in the areas recommended (dotted) and then blend with a clean brush each time.

danimalxX,relationships,1390926393.0,"One of my best friends got engaged. Basically went around telling people who her bridesmaids were going to be and named me as one of them. Engagement party came and I was not one of the ""chosen"" few. I was hurt at first. In the end I realized I would much rather be a spectator then part of the wedding party. Over the past months or so I have seen how much money and effort it takes to be part of weddings. Honestly you may find it much more enjoyable to just be invited.

Don't let it affect your friendship. While a wedding day is a big deal its is still only 1 day in someones life. All of the other days and moments that you have as friends are much more important then this. If you guys truly have a great friendship this shouldn't change anything. I also wouldn't mention it to her. The thing that comes with telling someone something like this is that lets say they add another person to the male side they will need to add a female. If it ends up being you and you had already talked to her you might feel like she is doing that just to appease you as a friend. Just let it ride out."
benk4,PoliticalDiscussion,1390926406.0,"&gt; Wouldn't that just devolve into the left leaning fringes votes becoming democrat votes and the right leaning votes becoming GOP?

Probably to start, but it would allow for more people to vote for a third party candidate because it doesn't give you the ""A vote for Johnson is a vote for Obama"" type thinking that greatly restricts 3rd party voting.  We'd get a true representation of people's #1 preferences.  In time maybe you see that some parties are catching up to others and you might see a switch to being a major party.  

For example, if we re-ran 2012 and got as the first choices:

Obama: 40%  
Romney: 35%  
Johnson 16%  
Stein: 9%  

People might seriously consider the Greens and Libertarians as contenders, funding and exposure would go up, and we might see 2016 as:  

Dem: 32%  
GOP: 32%  
Lib: 20%  
Green: 16%  

Now we actually have a race!  In a few years you might actually see the Greens and Libertarians become the dominant party on the left/right. 

Also this could have a major effect on lower ticket races.  If some minor party candidates could get elected to Congress it can seriously raise their profile.

However, as much as I disagree with the way she handled it, I would like to say that it was probably not intentional and NOT BECAUSE OF YOU. A **HUGE** part of attractiveness is hormones. That's not something that anyone has any control over, but it tends to be a major (and often unseen) reason why long distance relationships can fail.  Take one look at [how birth control affects attractiveness](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/birth-control-pills-affect-womens-taste/) and you'll see that it may not be because she's shallow or treacherous (although that's certainly still a possibility). My point is that your skin color and appearance are probably not to blame and your ex is just reaching for incorrect explanations out of guilt and confusion. Please don't internalize her reaction as you being unworthy.

I am so sorry that his happened to you, but this is one of the main reasons why you should always try to meet your SO before committing to move anywhere. That said, it seems like you're in the US to study, so at least you know you can move back to your home country fairly easily after that. My best advice is to grieve the loss of your relationship, but don't let it stop you from experiencing all that studying abroad can offer. There's so much to see and do in the US-do your best to focus on yourself now.

After all, a guy can be outgoing and social with his friends and acquaintances and still be nervous about approaching strangers just like how he could be extremely confident about his abilities when it comes to say, fixing cars and skydiving but still be nervous about some other activity.

A guy could be very nervous about approaching a girl because he's been harshly rejected in the past but once they're past that initial hurdle he's perfectly fine because he knows she's into him and the risk of instant rejection is gone which lets him relax and just be himself."

The truth is IEM Season 1 started in 2006 with Counter-Strike 1.6.  It's a LAN event that goes around different European cities to host tournaments as sort of a LAN league.

IEM stands for Intel Extreme Masters and it's managed/hosted by Electronic Sports League (ESL).

So a little background for you as I can recall it from my days of playing 1.6.  ESL was the premier e-Sports league in Europe while in North America I believe Cyberathlete Amateur League (CAL), Cyber Evolution (CEVO) and the beginning stages of the league from E-Sports Entertainment (ESEA) were happening.

The US had many LAN tournaments hosted by these various leagues with many of them sponsored by equipment manufacturers such as PNY, Intel, Nvidia, ATI, etc.  CAL had a major tournament called CPL, so I think ESL being the European counterpart worked with Intel to start IEM.  "

what if i'm someone who likes emphasizing my big hips? should i not wear peplum because according to you, it's not flattering? in the summer, should i constantly wear long-sleeved shirts to hide my fat arms because short sleeves aren't as flattering? should i only wear dark-coloured bottoms because they will flatter my legs by minimizing the appearance of my thick, muscular thighs? 

restricting yourself to wearing ""flattering"" clothes when your body type isn't the most societally acceptable is extremely limiting in terms of what you're able to wear. personally, i think people should just wear what they want, regardless of

And you *know* how much it's going to suck for your seatmate to be crowded, all while *your entire body* is also crowded... 

So yes. It's annoying. For everyone involved... 

But. It's temporary, and the odds are that it will impact your life for any more than the length of the flight is pretty fucking slim. 

It's an annoyance. An inconvenience. But it's hardly going to impact your being, because you can eventually get out of that seat and leave the fat behind... 

A fat person has to take it with them, and it's easy to judge people. Too easy. What's hard is imagining what it must be like... Not only to be fat, but to be very thin, and worst of all... How horrible must life be if your panties are in a twist over what other people are doing continually? I wonder if those people ever feel truly happy.

jeweledtree,weddingplanning,1390927057.0,"Ya, we could actually talk to FSIL and FBIL about it, since they actually know a bit more of our situation. That's not a bad idea. 

In terms of the 5 week old baby, I'm thinking the issues would be with travel. It's either a 10 hour drive, or a short flight, but that may be borderline too soon to take a baby on a plane? (I've been researching this today, haha). Showing the baby off would be super though, definitely. 

And I'm a bit confused about your comment on the passport, since the passport is for the baby. Wouldn't they have to wait until the baby was born to begin the paperwork? Maybe there are ways of getting some of the application done before birth, I suppose. And I'm sure it can be expedited too, but I'd hate to add more stress onto the shoulders of the new parents. 

And ya, Fiance's parents would definitely be there, we're all very close, so having people to help with the baby is no issue at all. Since it's such a low-key wedding, and 10-ish people total, it's no issue to us to have a baby around the whole time, even if it was crying or fussy. "
cptn_garlock,anime,1390927058.0,"&gt;Why would there be an OVA for Mother Rosario? I personally think we'll get ~15-17 episodes of GGO, and then 8-10 episodes of Mother Rosario, as part of a 2-cour season.

I didn't think MR is long enough to warrant 8-10 episodes, which is why I thought it'd be like a 3 episode OVA. Similarly with GGO, I don't think there's enough content to fill out more than 13 episodes unless they take it at a slower pace than I'd expect it too.

&gt;I also think GGO and Mother Rosario are the strongest part of the SAO novels up to date (having read everything that had come out), so I'm not sure about your misgivings.

I agree that MR is stronger, but I dunno if I agree that GGO is as strong as it. [Unless my memory is poorer than I thought, it felt like Sinon was being hand-held right through the end, which was disappointing. I still didn't really like Kirito as a character, so there's that. Also (and this is more of a nitpick), but making Kirito look like a girl seems incredibly unnecessary and really just felt like a way to insert another cute girl into the story since it had fewer characters compared to the earlier arcs (even if the girl is actually a G.I.R.L)](/spoiler)

&gt;Also, Mother Rosario is the most moving story, but it's so very heavy-handed in its emotional manipulation. It worked for me, but I couldn't help but note it.

I can agree with that; . What worked for me was that it had an interesting premise surrounding the implications and uses human/machine interfaces and VR, it developed Kirito in a way that wasn't reliant on his uber-powerful videogame persona by demonstrating his interest in robotics (kinda biased on that part), and it shifted focus to a character I felt didn't get a lot of attention before, Asuna. However, I agree that the novel was pretty heavy-handed."

palapiku,piano,1390927117.0,"Well, no offence, but the article specifically talks about people like yourself, who regularly play with other musicians and presumably aren't so bad:

&gt; Take a peek into a high school jazz band rehearsal or grab a seat at a college jazz combo concert. Better yet, walk into your local jam session or take a close look at the jazz trio playing the next time you’re at a wedding. What do you see?

Very many people play from a book, and they still get gigs and such. Clearly they are ""good enough"". But are they, you know, actually good? I have no opinion on *your* ability to play from a real book, since I've never heard you do it, but honestly most people I've heard who play from a book are uninspiring and pathetic, even though they are clearly good enough to get gigs since that's where I get to listen to them. They have turned jazz into 100% craft, a pastiche of tried-and-true techniques that use a chord progression to produce a tolerable solo that sounds okay in the background in a bar. I can absolutely relate to this passage from the article:

&gt; **“Jazz” becomes this thing that sounds the same everywhere you go. It becomes a predictable background music that never really reaches an emotional or creative high point.**

A thousand times this. And if you contrast this with any world-class performer who is actually, indisputably great - as the article points out, somehow *those* never play from a book."

cosalich,PlantedTank,1390927347.0,"Yes, Flourish Excel will provide a source of carbon for your plants that will not be released into the air. It stays in the water column for approximately 24 hours, so you have to dose every day. Also keep in mind that some people have reported that it will melt certain plants like valisneria and some ferns.

If you have your tank's water level high enough that your filter isn't *dropping* the water into the tank, simply returning it across the surface, there's no reason you can't add CO2 to the tank. Surface agitation will speed the loss of CO2 obviously, but it doesn't mean it's not worthwhile putting it in. I personally run pressurized CO2 and flourish excel in my work tank (5 gallons with a Quietflow 10)

Plants definitely help reduce the risk of algae by competing to use the nutrients that algae need to survive. That's not to say it's not possible; many of us struggled in the beginning to find a balance of light, carbon and fertilizers. Having a poor balance can actually lead to algae flourishing. "

MissCherryPi,PurplePillDebate,1390927626.0,"&gt;Every person on this planet is sexist to some degree, 

I would agree that no one can be a perfect feminist because human beings can easily revert to lazy stereotypes sometimes without noticing it. 

But then your statement loses all its meaning. It's like saying ""You can't be successful in life without being illogical to some degree"" because everyone is illogical sometimes. 

&gt;because sexism simply means that men and women have different strengths and weaknesses. 

I would define sexism as a point of view that emphasizes traditional gender roles as the norm and views anyone who falls outside them as at best an aberration. Sexist people seek to enforce these gender roles on those who don't wish to conform to them."
cosalich,PlantedTank,1390927648.0,"For the record, 1 gallon is roughly 3.8 litres.

Loaches love snails, obviously, but can sometimes have difficulties with trumpet snails. Between their love of burrowing and their incredibly protective shells, they're pretty well suited to defense.

The reality is that their effectiveness is probably somewhere between your and your husbands' expectations. A loach or two will certainly help the situation, but probably not completely upset the population too significantly.

My recommendation would be to get a few assasin snails and let them handle cleanup. Additionally, trumpet snails tend to flourish when there's excess food in the tank. Give your aquarium a thorough cleaning and cut back on your feeding schedule and they should slow down their breeding.

If all else fails, at least know that your trumpet snails are making the substrate an ideal environment for your plant roots!"

Add to that the fact that I also pointed out that without her songwriting and performance engineers and producers (which she is also one on most of her albums) would have nothing to go off of, making her the foundation for literally every song she performs.

Or to put it another way:  You wouldn't say Michael Jackson had no talent simply because of how produced his music was.  Especially not after the Thriller album, which cemented the importance of a skilled performer over a skilled engineer and producer, since without an excellent performance by michael, some of the best producers and engineers in the business couldn't make an album they felt was worth releasing."

It sounds like he might have a bit of a voyeur fetish.  But I don't know if he'd admit it to you even if you asked.  

Are you OK with him watching porn to get going, as long as it's not on while you're doing it?  He could even ""get himself started"" with porn alone, then come and initiate with you once the porn had done its job.  

He sounds like a guy with an LL who is also just kind of bored in the bedroom.  That's not uncommon and isn't something you should take personally.  Many people (but especially men) crave some degree of variety and excitement in bed.  The fact that toys spiced things up and then it went dead again speaks to this.

rmigz,leagueoflegends,1390927820.0,"First off, I think for the sake of talking about streaming as a method of professional entertainment I will preface this by saying that I feel that most streamers fall into two categories: *Education* or strictly *Amusement*.

Hard to pick a favorite, but I tend to enjoy the informational streams more than anything else.  

In no particular order:

**Education**

* Wingsofdeathx (@Wingsofdeathx)
* Sirhcez (@SirhcEz)
* TheOddOne (@TSMTheOddOne)
* Nightblue (@Nightbloo)

**Amusement**

* Qtpie (@dignitasQtpie)
* Bjergsen (@Bjergsen)
* Wild Turtle (@TSMWILDTURTLE)

Other good educational streams include Voyboy (@VoyboyLoL), Scarra (@dscarra), and Phreak (@RiotPhreak).

The reason that I'm linking Twitter handles is because, in most cases, you will find it easier to ask questions and get answers by messaging them via Twitter instead of Twitch chat.  For example, every time I've asked Sirhcez a question on Twitter about runes or music or whatever he has replied to me.

EDIT: he doesn't know this, and here's why!

PS: The quote I'm about to show you, is one that /u/lanemik used to argue *against me*, and so it is funny that he put the nails in his own cofffin.

&gt; The real universe consists of more than expanding space, of course: there is matter too. As space is compressed to zero volume, the density of matter becomes infinite, and this is so whether space is infinite or finite–in both cases there is infinite compression of matter to an infinite density. In Einstein’s general theory of relativity, on which this entire discussion is based, the density of matter serves to determine (along with the pressure) the curvature or distortion of space-time. If the theory of relativity is applied uncritically all the way down to the condition of infinite density, it predicts that the space-time curvature should also become infinite there. Mathematicians call the infinite curvature limit of space-time a singularity. In this picture, then, the big bang emerges from a singularity. ***The best way to think about singularities is as boundaries or edges of spacetime. In this respect they are not, technically, part of spacetime itself, in the same way that the edge of this page is strictly not part of the page.***

Emphasis mine..

Ultimately, /u/lanemik s argument was that the singularity represents the ""initial boundary of space and time"". However, there is nothing in our understanding of physics that considers it the ""initial"" boundary of spacetime, and even if it *did*, the singularity **technically isn't even a part of the universe**.

So, there we go. The one place he points to as the ""beginning"", the singularity, isn't even a part of spacetime. 

That pretty much seals the deal, for me."

1) NOt having grown up with long hair, I have no idea how to style it well.  I was getting better, but I hated the effort and time.
2) My hair type is very fine (thin strands) but I have a LOT of hair, it's something hairdressers always notice.  This makes styling difficult as it's likely to not hold any style for long.  A cute short cut just works better for my hair type.
3) I find that I have no interest in dating guys who DON'T like short hair on women.  They're usually invested in traditional gender roles, and I'm not.  That's as close as it comes to ""political"" for me."

Fluxxed0,magicTCG,1390928814.0,"Trading Post is a card that lets you convert one resource to another.  Given enough time, it can help you grind out an advantage that can lead to you winning the game.  However, look at what other decks are doing with their 4-drops:

* Mono-B: Desecration Demon (huge evasive threat)
* Mono-U: Bident of Thassa (potential for card advantage on the same turn it's played)
* GW Aggro: Advent of the Wurm (5/5 trample with flash)
* RG Monsters: Polukranos (5/5 who gets bigger and kills utility creatures)
* RDW: Fanatic of Mogis (4/2 plus 3-5 damage to the opponent's face)

These are all huge threats that have to be answered immediately (or in RDW's case, it might just be the end of the game).  Comparatively, Trading Post is very slow.  It takes several turns before you can use Trading Post to gain an advantage, and while you're making Goats and sacrificing creatures, your opponent is bashing your skull in with all those threats he was playing."

pamplemus,AskWomen,1390929043.0,"one of the main reasons my ex broke up with me was he played league of legends 15+ hours a day and i didn't play at all. i'm pretty sure that was just an excuse so he could date the girl he was cheating on me with... who he met via league of legends. joke's on him - i play with my husband now and it's so fun!

also, he didn't want to deal with my depression, anxiety, and body image issues. ok, that's not so bad. except his depression,
anxiety, and body image issues were even more severe than mine. i think the worst part was he was upset with me for ""tricking"" me me into dating him by not revealing my mental illnesses until some time into the relationship. he complained a lot about why couldn't i go back to just pretending i'm happy like i did when we first met. meanwhile, he expected me to constantly
boost his self-esteem -_-"

Civilization overlays the basics to a degree but not perfectly at the deep bottom.

Its not an excuse, but it is something to work at in developing that type of sensitivity to see things from the other perspective.

Us true warriors and hunters learn to see and think like the quarry so we can exploit weaknesses, defend from their strengths.

minminkitten,AlAnon,1390929190.0,"Be stern with her. Tell her you saw the bottle and you smelt it off of her breath and that if she wants to get clean, she needs to be honest with herself first. She needs to WANT to be sober. She can't do this just because you want her to and she wants you to stay.

I know it seems harsh but if she's just going to pretend to be sober for you in order to have you stick around, that's not someone that you want to be with. 

I'd have a good stern conversation with her, of course when you know she is sober, and let her know that you are aware she still does it in secret. Tell her that you don't want this for you, you want it for her and that if her heart isn't in it, not to bother. It's hard to come out on top over the alcohol and don't disillusion yourself that you will. You won't. And until she decides she wants to get clean from her own volition, without any external pressure, she won't. 

Of course there is the exceptions to the rule. But I have yet to meet someone that is. I've also been that person. My ex had drinking problems too and he would lie to me CONSTANTLY about his drinking intake/problem. He wanted me to stay, so he would lie. I stayed, I tried to help. I wasted 3 years of my life trying to help to realize, he wasn't changing. Booze wins over me and I deserve someone that will love me 100% and want to be there for me as well as me for them. Not just a one way parent/child relationship. I didn't want to end up like my mom. It was a hard decision to break up with him and he is still in my life (as a friend) and of course, he never quit drinking even if ""I was the love of his life"" and he BEGGED me to stay. Booze won and I didn't really matter to him. I was just there to pay for stuff, to scrape him off the floor when he got too drunk, to lie for him to his/my family/friends. 

Don't get stuck in this because you want to help. Take care of you. You are the person that matters the most in the world because when you die, you have only yourself and your memories. Don't rack up terrible memories of deception, lies, wasted efforts, etc. Live happy, live for you. 

Go to an Al Anon meeting, they will help you a lot to get a new perspective on your situation so that you can further assess what you want to do from there. "

But you need to be prepared for the politicking. There is a great deal of respect ingrained in the culture for seniority. Hire number 1 will naturally rank higher on the pecking order than hire number 2. If you promote hire 2 over hire 1 even if hire 2 is the better worker and is better suited for the responsibility, you need to be prepared for some shit. Obviously it depends on the individuals in question, and the current younger generation aren't oblivious to it and dislike the system in general.

proclivity4passivity,sex,1390929441.0,"Hormonal birth control is very effective. Its typical use failure rate is much lower than that of condoms, per http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/unintendedpregnancy/contraception.htm

Pill packs always come with instructions that tell you when you would need to use additional protection, for instance when first starting BCP or if she misses a pill. Setting a phone alarm is a good way to ensure she doesn't miss a dose if she is worried about that. There are also other methods of birth control (IUDs, implants, Nuva Ring, etc.) that take remembering to take a pill out of the equation.

Hormonal birth control prevents ovulation, so there shouldn't be any ""high risk time,"" ever, unless she misses a dose or two.

In my opinion, the only time you would need to use condoms as backup is if she is just starting birth control after being off it for a while. But she's obviously nervous about not using condoms, so you need to talk about it with her. Make sure you both understand how birth control works and that she is comfortable with everything before switching to no condoms. If she is terrified, bareback sex is not going to be good anyway.

**TLDR:** You probably don't need to use condoms, but if your SO is terrified of sex without them, you might want to anyway.

Let's look at this from a game-theory standpoint: so you've got a society who's getting its ass handed to it. It's running out of food, it's poor, the people are uneducated, poor infrastructure.

How do you keep morale high in this society? how do you get people to work together when they don't know that's more effective?

religion. religion is the quick and messy way to group people together over a common bond, so that they can hopefully manage to survive to a point where they don't need that common bond, because their socio-economic status isn't in the fucking toilet.

Second of all, labeling things like this rape is incredibly detrimental to ACTUAL rape victims as it deteriorates the impact that a rape case should have due to the fact that everything seems to be rape these days.

delqhic,CoDCompetitive,1390929814.0,"I'm very impressed by it. IW seem to have taken all the feedback from the original maps and fixed them in this DLC (except for Fog); the main complaint of the original maps being that they're too dull and not colourful enough. Bayview and Ignition are both bright, fun maps to play on, and they're not completely destroyed like most maps in this game. Bayview is a fucking maze though. Ignition is pretty much identical to Scrapyard with a few small differences.

Containment is decent, reminds me a lot of Chasm with the multiple routes and hiding spots though. I'm having fun on it, but Domination is pretty odd. The home flags on the map have sight lines to one another, so if you're on C, you're actually able to shoot people off A and vice versa.

Fog is a god awful map. It's dark, there's too many routes, it's a map made for people who like to pick a corner and sit in it. I haven't tried Mike Myers yet though so it may be good for that.

The Maverick assault rifle is my favourite weapon in the game now. Using Red Dot and Grip, I just went 62-7 in a Containment Domination. It drops people in the same amount of bullets as the Remington, but it has a faster fire rate. I would love to be able to use it in competitive.

I haven't tried the new sniper yet though.

Overall, I'd say this is a pretty great DLC. Would definitely recommend picking it up and I'd love to see Bayview/Ignition/Containment in competitive play, although I doubt it'll happen."

MissCherryPi,PurplePillDebate,1390929831.0,"&gt;TRP does not wish to enforce natural gender roles onto anyone, it simply says that if you want to attract high quality people of the opposite sex your best bet is to fall into these gender roles, and seek mates who also fall into these gender role

Them's some weasel words. It's not that we want to enforce gender roles, it's just if you don't fit into them, you are unnatural and you'll never find love.

I'm also still waiting for how sexism is useful. First you said you need it for success, and now it's a basic survival tool. The example you gave was that the way you act around your friends isn't appropriate for the women you are sleeping with. I don't see how that has anything to do with *sexism* per se. Most people act different at a bar than they would at work. I am a feminist, many of my friends are feminists, none of us are doing badly at basic survival. 

If Michael Bloomberg and Barack Obama are sexist, how did that contribute to their success? Why would they rely so much on Christine Quinn and Hillary Clinton if they knew that women were so *different*?"

ariden,Cheap_Meals,1390930249.0,"I make a similar soup but add a package of chopped spinach and use my own tomato soup base:

I take 2 cans diced tomatoes, juice strained off and reserved, and a diced red pepper. I drizzle on olive oil, Italian seasoning and garlic and roast in the oven 15 minutes at 350.

While it's roasting, I take the juice and add it to 4 cups chicken broth (I make my own by slow cooking a chicken but you can buy some), then bring that to a simmer.

 take the tomatoes out of the oven and dump into the broth and blend it up to the texture you like!

Out of that, you end up with a great tomato soup, a whole cooked chicken, and then you can upgrade the tomato soup into vegetable soup if you please.

Total cost:
Tomatoes: ~3.00 total
Red pepper: ~1.00
Frozen veg: ~1.00
Spinach:~2.00
Chicken:~4.00
Beef: ~3.00

~14.00 will yield at least 6 meals of soup (served with bread) and at least 4 meals of chicken. That's lunch and dinner for a workweek. I usually eat the breasts as is, with rice or vegetables, then shred the remaining meat and eat in stir frys, curry, chicken salad etc."

What I mean with positioning is doing things like baiting them around a corner where their movement is limited and prefiring the corner, or baiting them into a small room where you have the advantage. Sometimes you can also jump on their heads for an easy kill when they're distracted (but never jump at them when they're looking at you).

#3 rocks and sticks. I liked to make mud pie like potions outside in a hollow between some roots of the tree at the end of the driveway. Rocks to cut/mash up various plants and sticks to stir.

#4 fondue or pot pourri pot
For making indoor potions with pot pourri, dish soap, mossy stuff from grandma's nativity scene, whatever.

ailorn,AskWomen,1390930850.0,"Do you have a supportive mother figure in your life besides your mother? I've seen where some people will kinda adopt an aunt, grandma or a neighbor as a mother figure. Of course there are exceptions to the above rule, it's likely just one flag among many."
UlgraTheTerrible,bipolar,1390930865.0,"Well, I wish your husband's brother and uncle hadn't taken advantage of your illness, which was clearly present, even if not diagnosed. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish just what is and isn't abuse, but I think that people who would use the girlfriend/wife of someone they supposedly *loved* for sex are quite *clearly* abusive jerks, even if you *had* thrown yourself at them or something. 

Sometimes, especially for us, it's hard to tell what is right, and what is wrong, what is illness, and what is not. 

I.. don't know how emotionally solid/stable your husband is, so I can't encourage you to tell him about this one unless you have no other choice or you know that he will support you. I don't want to see you get any more abuse from *anyone* at this point, so I'd say don't risk it.. 

But you don't have to feel guilty about this any more. I'm telling you that, right here and now. 

This is what I would do, if I were you. Yes, it is cold, yes it is calculated, but it is *completely* deserved.... 

This boyfriend of your cousin... You are going to take a deep breath, and look him in the face, and tell him that he is scum. You will tell him that if he says anything, you will get a restraining order, and will sue the shit out of him for defamation of character and/or slander. 

And if... *if*... he tells your husband, you will then tell your husband exactly what happened. The truth will set you free. But be sure to emphasize that you couldn't tell him because you didn't want to destroy his family. Tell him *why* this happened. Tell him that you were mentally ill, undiagnosed, and had no *idea*... Tell him that you are, to this day, ashamed and disgusted and you want nothing to do with his brother or his uncle, because they would use you like that. I assume this is nothing but true. 

But the fact is, you can ask your husband not to tell your family. You can hope that he is a kind enough, caring enough, and loving enough person to understand that this was many years ago, that you have been eaten alive by guilt, and that it was driven by an untreated mental illness and horrible people who would take advantage of a young woman. 

You are not that young woman anymore. You have grown, you have changed. You have gotten treatment. You have been faithful for 12 years. You kept a secret that would destroy a family as long as you could, but... It's time to let go of it. 

Don't kill yourself. Everything will work out, but you have to deal with this. Try to calm down a little too. Please understand that this boyfriend of your cousin is *toxic*... 

And hopefully your husband will realize that too. 

But I can promise one thing... If your husband decides to leave you, you will survive it. I honestly don't think he will, but you will survive if he does. You will continue to be strong, and if you need the hospital, you will go... 

But I do know one thing... Nothing... *nothing* that happens will be worse than the punishment you have put yourself through by keeping this inside for so long. You deserve to forgive yourself now. You deserve to be forgiven by your husband, even if that doesn't happen. You deserve a chance at happiness... 

And your family will be devastated by your suicide. If you stay alive, maybe things can be repaired. If you don't, that'll leave a hole that can never be filled. 

I wish you the best. "

I'm not stating that ""he should just have more confidence"" or any of that other bs, because having my own personal issues, I understand completely that this advice is disingenuous and often belittling.

My main concern is that he states that there are problems, but then goes onto disenfranchise anyone who might want to help.  You're 5'5""?  Well, you don't understand what it's like to be 5'2"".  You admit that there's heightism?  Well, you're tall, so you can't possibly understand.

And to a point, I can agree with this.  For me, I can't understand what it's like to be 7' tall, the same way someone 6'2"" probably can't understand what it's like to be as tall as me.  But there are common issues all of us can associate with.  Maybe I don't talk about how ****ing expensive everything is on the tall end with a person 6'2"", but for plane seats, we can agree that they're uncomfortable.

But take a situation like bullying.  Yes, it can get infuriating to hear how you've been bullied too when your version of bullying is something like someone just calling you names versus being swirlied at least once a week while going through school with teachers doing nothing about it and the blame being placed on you for being the victim.

The point is, sure, a person might not be capable of understanding a situation, but if they're willing to help, why turn them away?  A person doesn't need to understand a situation in order to be willing to help.  People give time and money to charity all the time without truly understanding poverty.  Imagine if Habitat for Humanity didn't allow anyone who isn't poor to help out.  Sometimes, we all need friends in our corner even if they're incapable of understanding the situation."

BalorLives,progressive,1390931609.0,"Once again I am not asking about what you want, I am asking if the government should be used to force a woman who as been raped to bring a baby to term. If you believe they should, say unequivocally ""I believe the government should force all rape victims to carry their baby to term."" 

To what end should this enforcement be extended? Should the government force her to stop drinking and smoking as well? Taking prescription drugs that may harm the baby? Should the government also pay for the lost potential wages for the woman who has had her life hijacked by an unwanted fetus? If a woman has a miscarriage will there be an investigation to determine if it really was a miscarriage?"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_de_l%27assurance_automobile_du_Qu%C3%A9bec

""SAAQ (English: Quebec Automobile Insurance Corporation), is a Quebec crown corporation responsible for licensing drivers and vehicles in the province and providing public auto insurance which insures all drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists involved in road collisions whether or not they are at fault. Coverage, however, is limited to personal injuries — damage to property is covered by private insurers.[1]""


It is still ~600$ total though for the same coverage you'd get in any other province.

SAAQ basically makes it so if you cripple someone you are covered no matter what.. they can't sue you for everything like they do in the US (other provinces?)"
Dovahkiin42,Liberal,1390931668.0,I have a question for you. Why did this require another post here? 
Dabookitty,atheism,1390931674.0,"Do you have children?

I ask because a friend of mine talked to his doctor about getting one since he had no interest in having kids.  His doctor told him he would only perform it on men who already had kids, because if he changed his mind it could be reversed, but it would be unnecessary pain and cost that could be avoided.  His doctor told him just use Condoms and if there was an issue there is always the morning after pill.

He is glad his doctor did talk him out of it.  He is now married and his wife does want children, so in the end it definately saved a lot unnecessary pain.

EDIT:  Read below you already have 2 kids.  So I don't see any reason why they should decline the procedure at all.  No religious reason I can think of off the top of my head(though I am sure there is a religious excuse).  It's responsible family planning on your part, and if you did change your mind it's easier for the man to get it reversed then for your wife to get her tubes tied and reversed.  

When you do get it done DO NOT GO FOR A WALK!!  My a friend did that since he felt fine after the surgery, he was gone with the kids for about an hour or 2.  I can only imagine the pain he was in the next day.  Had a good laugh at him for not listening to the doctor.  Though hearing him explain to his kids why Daddy was sore was very amusing indeed."

She then selected a pale green strapless bridesmaid dress that was too tight on her, which she bought at a thrift store.  We initially asked that she let us select a dress with her, explaining it was inappropriate.  She refused and bought a blue dress that had stains from another thrift store, and insisted she'd been to all the dept stores and they had nothing in her size.  

We had told her that we were looking to find a minister for our ceremony, and whether she'd walk me at all would depend on that.  We had actually decided I'd be standing from the outset with the minister.  She asked us every time we saw her about the minister search and nothing else, and changed the subject to that each time we discussed any other details with her, in a very transparent manner.

Eventually we told her the actual plan, and several fights later she acquiesced and we went on without issue, though she still wore the stained blue dress.  But 3 months after our wedding--and after several polite, enjoyable visits--she refused to see me for my birthday, saying ""I don't feel like celebrating your birthday"" and refused to let dad see me either.  We had some discussions and got into therapy after I waited 2 months to see them at all.

deathsmaash,turtle,1390932536.0,"I think different subs needs to create their own system of ""reddiquette"" for upvoting/downvoting. According the the rules of reddit, voting is intended to be based on relevance of comment or whether it accurately (correctly) adds to the discussion. However, in practice this is not the case because many, if not most users, up and down vote based on personal tastes and whether or not they like the comment. So, in a thread about opinions on relationships, the latter method of upvoting downvoting has more merit because it shows whether or not other users agreed with a specific comment. In this thread though, there was a clearly posed question for which this comment was downvoted because it was incorrect. "

Blindocide,DebateReligion,1390932725.0,"&gt; If there is a moment in time A for which there is no previous moment in time, then time began at moment A

what do you mean by ""previous time"" and what are you using to differentiate between ""previous"" and ""latter""?

we've had this discussion before, lanemik. Saying there is a ""first moment"" is like saying there is a ""first point"" on the skin of a watermelon. There isn't one. Then you'll try to say there is a T=0 like Templeyak did, but that too is faulty. There is no ""first time"", and there is nothing in our understanding of science or physics (of which time is subject) that suggests there is a meaningful way to distinguish between a ""beginning"" and an ""end"" of our universe.

It's almost like you don't pay attention to anything I say.

Your hilarious, and misguided, analogy between ""the universe"" and ""a human footrace"" is, well, just that. a footrace exists in a system of time outside of itself, the universe does not. this is pretty much the biggest fault of the analogy.

Kalam's notion of time is obviously faulty. Kalam didn't know about special relativity. So, sure. Differ to a different Cosmological Argument, if you so choose. We'll tackle that one too.


EDIT: The argument we have going down this thread *literally goes full circle*. It ends with me asking him ""is the edge of the paper the *initial point* of the paper?"" which is essentially asking him ""what's the first point on the skin of a watermelon?""

Since that cannot be answered in a meaningful, non arbitrary way, I'm going to take this as a concession that lanemik knows not of what he speaks."

Neebat,AskMenOver30,1390933066.0,"&gt; No long-term, healthy relationship can result when a woman makes the first move they claim.

That's a claim rarely ever put forward by a man.  It's almost always a woman trying to keep other women in line.  Haven't they ever heard, ""A well-behaved woman never made history""?

People claim to know what men want more than men do.  Telling us what we really want when dating is just one bit of it.

Ask a 1000 men how they feel about make-up.  A small amount will say they don't care because they never notice it.  That's your target market, but a much larger percentage will say they notice it and it's unattractive.  But if you ask women, they believe it's the key to unlocking men's hearts.

Kac3rz,AskWomen,1390933114.0,"I'm not sure I'd agree with your husband, or rather I would, if I expand this a little.

I think a man can have a great friendship with women as long as the other components of his male-female relationships are in place. Maybe he met a love of his life already. Maybe he's the type for whom a 2 week relationship is a long one and he's much more into one night stands. Maybe he doesn't pursue a relationship right now, because he has other important goals. As long as his relationships with women are close to a state he would like them to be, he can be a great.

The problem starts, when his female friends are the only women in his life who are friendly and affectionate towards him, never mind if he's single or in a failed relationship. If his friends are the only women who fill his emotional needs in a male-female contact, he may quickly, and even subconsciously, try to make them fulfill also his romantic and sexual needs.

So, I wouldn't say that a man cannot be a friend with a woman without a subtext, but almost every man was/will be at the point in his life, when it will be hard for him to just be friends with some women, as well as a moment, when it will come completely naturally to him."

They generally don't have the same desire for ""looking nice, just because"" that girls generally do.  Since they noticed that you started wearing nice clothes, but they didn't know that you were wearing them because you felt good about yourself, they jumped to the conclusion that you were looking for attention, because that's why they would've started wearing nice clothes.

It's not worth explaining this to them, though.  If they don't have enough sense to keep their mouth shut, they won't have enough sense to believe you.  But that's why people are saying you did something wrong, even though you didn't."

I hate that this sort of freedom is taken away when going into highschool and furthermore that children aren't even allowed to enjoy it anymore. 

My friends and I used to fight, explore, and get hurt. However does that mean that we are doing drugs and drinking today? No, actually quite the opposite. "
banebridge,Anxiety,1390933198.0,"Contrary to what you would think, anxiety is just a bad habit that is very subtle; we don't realize we're DOING it and think it's happening to us (I'm certainly not saying we're at fault here, it's a sneaky process). What happens is after we have a long period of stress/stressful event (opiate addiction for me), our body brings about these very intense feelings because all that adrenaline that builds up needs an outlet. 

The reason panic attacks become chronic is because when we're in one, we add our own ""second fear"" to the fear we're already feeling. Well, this is what fuels the fire! Our body/mind has natural coping mechanisms that bring us out of our bad thoughts and feelings, but we don't realize this and feel like we have to go back and fix them, and in turn create a lot of tension for ourselves. Once we realize what we're thinking, it's actually when we're coming out of that thought/feeling, and all we have to do is ""deflate"", so to speak. When you're having a panic attack, all you need is 110% confidence that you will get through. IT WILL NEVER HURT YOU. Over time, these bad thoughts that come to us will lessen, and our habit of ""fixing"" WILL SUBSIDE. Your mind will get over the urge to panic, over time. The key is true self-belief. 

The reason you have derealization/unable to think/feel is because your body and mind have shut your feelings down to protect you, they can't take anymore of the war you keep having with them. I had so much existential anxiety it drove me fucking insane. I literally thought I didn't exist, I had to count cars in the parking lot one time just to ground myself a little bit. It was torture. I tried suicide three times. Two years later, I'm happy. I don't panic, I don't worry. Of course life still has its negative moments, but I let my brain do it's job. Recovery from anxiety is about ""not doing"", because we've been ""doing"" something for so long. 

I know this is complicated, so feel free to PM me. In fact I DEMAND IT. "

ikkleste,SquaredCircle,1390933431.0,"As a self confessed Bryan mark, i can see what you are saying but i disagree. 4 months of screwjobs which suddenly went cold with no pay-off indicated they were saving his win for bigger and better things. Elimination Chamber isn't that. Blowing the moment at EC would be the same as doing it at Survivor series or TLC. The wait has meant it deserves more. It should be on the biggest stage, wrestlemania. And to get there he should have earned it himself going through the Rumble.

In a way, even if they rewrite to get Bryan to the Mania main even (or even if they intended to all along) they've blown the most logical way to have him earn his place. And that is in large part due to the crowd. Because we've wanted it so bad, and they've done such a good job of making it look like we won't get it, if somehow it does turn out that he does get it it's going to look like he's just been given it, and that was 'cause we threw our toys out of the pram, not that he earned it.

I'm not sure how worked this mistake is, no-one is. But I worry that if it is they've actually been too successful and it's going to look less like Bryan overcoming, and more like a reversal in the face of crowd pressure. That makes the Authority look weak to us the crowd rather than Daniel Bryan."

When you store a very big number as a floating point, it is not stored as 2.34 * 10^6.   It's handled as binary, completely, and that includes the base and the exponent.  So numbers around 10^6 are going to be stored with an exponent of 10011 or 10100.  That means they're treated as multiples of 2^19 or 2^20, and the mantissa will be different from what you expect from a decimal representation."

Inglot does square pans though, I'm guessing so it's a little bit harder to mix-and-match brands with their palettes or maybe just to be fancy. Ideally (to me at least), indie makers would get together and decide to use one size (26mm maybe?) for ease of building a palette across multiple brands. :P 

Otherwise, if you don't have the funds to press everything yourself, I'm not sure it would cost less to have someone press them for you (although it would, of course, involve less time on your part.

Futurecat3001,summonerschool,1390934175.0,"OK, his ult lowers damage in a medium-sized area by 20%.  Cool.  It's not nothing.

Know how much Leona's ult lowers damage?  100%.  Because it's AOE cc you can use to catch people and initiate teamfights from a reasonably long range.  If you play Leona well and have a pick comp that can follow up on her engage, there's a good chance you can delete a priority target before the fight even starts, a lot of the time.  I'll take that over shaving 20% from Shyvana's burnout damage any day of the week.

I'll grant you if you play an all-bruiser teamcomp that just wants to stand there slapping things, Maokai's ult looks pretty attractive.  But for the kinds of situations that actually come up, the strong supports right now (Annie, Thresh, Leona) have a combination of strong laning and teamfight zone control.  Maokai offers very little in the way of deterring a hard engage the way a flash-Tibbers, Solar Flare, or well-placed Box does.

Also, claiming Maokai has a higher skillcap than Leona is utter nonsense. Maokai has zero difficult skillshots; most of his skills are just point and click.  The difference between a Leona who knows exactly where to place her R and one who doesn't is enormous.  A good max-range Leona flash+E or flash+R can initiate a fight with enough cc to enable follow-up from a HUGE distance away.  Maokai can... pick a good spot to throw down his non-skillshot R?  I mean, seriously?  Give me a break - I don't think you even know what ""high skillcap"" means."

It was a huge fucking mistake. 

Why? Because, had I slept with my spouse before we got married, if, in fact, we'd lived together for a while before we got married, I would've had the experience to see the giant red flags of incompatibility. 

We were totally and completely not in tune with each other, and never would be. It wasn't just the lack of sex, or the perfunctory sex when we did have it. That was just one of the many problems, and would've helped illustrate the others before it was too late.

I stuck it out for eleven years before I finally threw in the towel and got a divorce. 

The fact that you keep restricting yourself is a problem for the kind of women you seem to want to be with. Because it isn't just you that you're restricting. It's them too.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,Songwriters,1390935217.0,"First off, we're comparing apples to oranges in a few ways.

ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC are performing rights organizations (PROs). Their primary function is to collect performance royalties on the behalf of their members. Some are for profit, others are not. If you are aspiring to be a professional songwriter, you pick one and hope you get a hit. ASCAP and BMI are almost exactly the same. SESAC is a bit different. Bear in mind, you won't make jack until a song is huge. That's just the way they crunch the numbers, and next to no one understands the equation. [More here](http://blog.songtrust.com/songwriting-tips/pros-whats-the-difference/) and [here](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/music-royalties7.htm).

Tunecore and CDBaby are agregators/digital distributors. You should include ReverbNation into your query as well. These are basically ""package deal"" services offered to consumers and indies rather than ""professionals"". Professionals tend to have publishing companies, labels, and distributors to take care of this stuff for them...lots of individual specialists who take care of each link in the chain. Service companies like CDBaby use registrar database shortcuts, economics of scale, technology, and vendor agreements to help indies get their music distributed online without all the red tape and overhead costs. They are for-profit companies that take a cut of your earning (in advance) in exchange for their service. Which one is right for you will be specific to your goals and capital. These guys have nothing to do with royalties and everything to do with sales. You can expect to actually make direct money from sales using these guys. [More here](http://howtorunaband.com/digital-distribution-reverbnation-vs-cdbaby-vs-tunecore/) and [here](http://members.cdbaby.com/cdbaby-vs-tunecore.aspx?gclid=COLWsrHBobwCFQto7Aod4iIAwQ). 

Bear in mind, everything these companies do can be done on your own if you have the time/energy and a willingness to do the research and and negotiate. CDBaby distributes my music to lots of places that I've never heard of which could be good or could be pointless, but, the smaller the fish, the easier it is to negotiate deals if I were to go it on my own. Keeping up with them on the other hand is time-consuming, which is why these services are awesome.

While we're on the subject, do not overlook [SoundExchange](http://www.soundexchange.com/). It covers the gray area between performance royalties and sales known as *streams*. It's a whole new thing that too many artists don't even realize exists. Lots of people are missing out on lots of money because they aren't thinking like business-people.

I started doing this stuff before it was popular, and, at the time, CDBaby was the only one. I signed up for SoundExchange because it's the only one and for ASCAP just because my favorite artists were on it. I still use CDBaby for my indie label releases because I've been more than happy with them, because its well worth the cost in the administration duties they perform for me, and because I'm a huge fanboy of the guy who started all this, [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/). If I got bigger I would most certainly hire a staff or let a publisher take over. I heard recently about a new company offering 1-song digital distro deals which is amazing. Being able to release and distribute singles instead of full albums will change everything. The point is, it's constantly changing and it's very important to do your own research and read as much as you can (especially contracts!) before signing up for a service.

Cheers"

JHemingway,short,1390935281.0,"I don't like the ideia, and I will try to explain as much as I can everything about it that I don't like:

First, there isn't much tall girls with short guys with online presence on reddit to make it enough to build a sub around that ideia - trust me that I really wish that you can prove me wrong in that. If you wanted to make something around that, you could make something like /r/theguyisshorter , where it could be a relationship where it just happens that the guy is shorter than her (will he be 6'0'' or 5'0''). And even that, I don't think a sub will be the best plataform for that subject. I think you could do much better with tumblr, for example.

Second, why is is that a short guy with a tallete is that of a good thing, or at least a remarkable thing? Don't get me wrong, I totally like to see relationships like those, they are motivational and I take my hat to those girls who are strong enough to question social norms.
But, in essence, /r/shortieandtalletes wouldn't be that different from short girls with super-tall guys. You are even using the fact that a girl is tall as some (and before you rush to downvote, note that I've said *some*) short girls use the fact that their boy is tall: As an achievment.

A good relationship is a good relationship, and a beautiful girl is a beautiful girl, will she come as short, average or tall.

Dance bars are India's version of strip clubs. No stripping. Women gyrate/dance to Bollywood numbers.  Some also served as a front for prostitution. Middle aged men (mostly) flick currency notes. Illegal now. You will find some of them around. The women just sing. There are still some on the outskirt areas like Thane.

The bar scene is not too bad. A lot of expats in the city and a lively city it is. Bandra is the party suburb. there are literally drinking joints around every corner though. Clubs are ok though, motly teenaged kids or middle aged folks. the night life has taken a pounding after police raided an establishment.

Anyways, I'm on my 6th set of squats ofr so and it's my last one. I haven't done legs in ages so I load up with 275 and grind out 5 good reps. I decide I may as well go for a 6th rep and I get about 3/4 of the way down and I think I'm gonna have to cheat and not squat to depth. I grow a pair and decide I'm gonna go all out and if I fail, I fail. Long story short is I fail out and get stuck on the safety bars. I get out from under the weight and hear laughing. I then turn around to see 2 300+ lb thunder cunts pointing and laughing at me. Mind you they were repping out all of 15 pounds on the chest press. I may have failed a set of squats, but at least I don't fail at life. "

I guess if that's the case they've got to be *very* good at handling this from here out.

1) DBry wins, main event wrestlmania. Elimination chamber win and title defense (triple threat Orton's rematch clause?) seems like the story line way to do it, but I (and i think a lot of others) are past a point where anything but him winning the title and getting the Moment at the Mania main event is the only pay off that's worth four months of screwjobs in the ring and three months of having him out of ring pushed down to the curtain-jerker (if this is supposed to be a Kayfabe 2.0 thing).

2) He has to earn it. It has to feel like he got there by overcoming the system that's been keeping him down. Not that we got him the main event, but he earned it even against all they throw at him. They've done such a good job at holding him down though that this is tricky to do without it seeing like a reversal. I haven't seen raw yet but other stars coming out for him doesn't fit this very well and worrys me a bit.

Therefore, if he still has it in his possession, he has an available glamor to disguise himself or another as Rattleshirt.

Furthermore, if the glamor Rattleshirt was wearing that disguised him as Mance is still intact, or if another such thing was made, Melisandre could have given it to Mance, allowing him to disguise another person as him. That could be a potential means of avoiding capture (some people think Ramsay believes he has Mance caged because he's captured someone with such a glamor).

I would say the biggest issue we would have on the transfer would be that he plays for Bilbao.  They will have a monster release on him and they never drop from the release, never have, never will.  Remember they let Llorrente walk for free rather than sell him for less than his release.

If we are looking at a winger (shouldn't be a priority) from Spain with tons of potential then Alvaro Vadillo from Real Betis seems like he would be a hell of allot easier to make a deal for."

princesskiki,aww,1390936029.0,"The source of my frustration is definitely the people falling for it.  I have a knee jerk reaction whenever I see people sharing, liking, and commenting on the photo with comments that suggest they believe it is real and unedited.

I'll photoshop a stray hair out of my face or to remove blemishes and clean up skin tone, and that doesn't seem wrong.  I also am well aware that all food photos are edited heavily and obviously you're not going to get a burger at McDonald's that looks like the one in the picture.  

The problem with this particular set of photos is that it IS because extremely bad breeding is going on.  This style of photoshopping is popularized by a few super shady breeders, namely Boutique Teacup Puppies, Luxpups, and MsPuppyConnection (And I'm sure a few others by now).  When these photos go viral (and they do constantly) there are future consumers begging to know what kinds of dogs they are (because the breed is obviously totally obscured by the alterations) and where they can get them.   In turn, these breeders have a high demand for the puppies and continue to pump out unhealthy dog after unhealthy dog.   There was even some speculation that one of them was underfeeding puppies before shipping them to their new homes so they would ""make weight"" since people are obsessed with getting pups of a certain size, without taking into consideration their health.

If nobody was profiting off of these photos being shared all over, I would be considerably less upset by it.  But there are animals suffering as a result.  And there are people who shouldn't be buying dogs...buying the wrong dogs because of it."

Not sure how widespread it is in the community or whether its a small group of dicks but sometimes when you're giving a fuck its a good indicator to realize when something unjust is happening or retarded. Based on this and assuming you can't change their behavior sometimes one can realize the things they can change and the things they can't. That takes practice and perhaps it will continue to hurt as their behavior continues but if its out of your hands best to recognize that is the case and your body will only naturally respond by giving a fuck because our minds continue to problem solve whether we like it or not. But you can recognize that you are separate from your minds automatic reactions and know that you are not an asshole like those you are unfortunately engaging with. The kind of people of who get off on demeaning others and causing them trouble usually have deeper problems and need an outlet which unfortunately you guys being soft targets makes it that much more appealing. Even if you were to engage every person in logical discussion or shout back at them to make it stop its very hard to do so all the time and maybe if you desire can let it be. Best to stick together with your friends and support each other as you guys go through any hardships.

bigtcm,TrueAskReddit,1390936566.0,"I apologize for the novel below, I didn't realize until after I finished typing how much I wanted to gush about my old job and my old boss.

I don't think I've ever had an easy full time job. For four years of my life, I was a high school teacher. I absolutely LOVED my work environment when I started teaching and the boss (the principal at the time) was the main reason why.

Our school was known for the camaraderie amongst the teachers and the students; I'm still very good friends with many of the old staff members there. That was the only school I've ever been at (speaking as a teacher and as a student) where school spirit was genuine and highly emphasized in the day to day activities. 

Our boss was super easy going and very well liked and EVERY teacher would go up to bat for him. His main strength was leadership. It honestly felt like I was a member of some elite sports team. He'd go one by one during the meetings, pointing at us, addressing us by our last name (since my last name was short, he'd call me ""fuckin' (last name)"" expecting a short to the point answer. Special roles and committee member was assigned in a similar fashion. My students probably knew more science than he did, and he was well aware of the fact that he didn't know anything about the subjects that we taught. As long as our scores were high and we didn't cause any problems, he wouldn't bother us. However, I knew that he would have my back the minute I needed help. 

He propagated the culture of the school - I've never been in a place that epitomized ""work hard, play harder"" more than that school. I've never worked so hard for someone who, upon seeing me, would chuckle and call me a  ""fucking loser"" and make fun of the fact that I was a nerdy young Asian guy on a staff of mostly middle aged white folk teaching a predominantly ghetto Mexican population. We'd have monthly happy hours, and he'd host holiday get togethers at the bar...and would proceed to buy rounds of hard liquor for everyone there.  It probably doesn't need to be said, but we worked our asses off for him - our school was one of the fastest improving schools in the district. Graduation rates were high, and accordingly so was the staff satisfaction. 

After noticing the meteoric success of our school, the district quickly promoted him to a bigger school. From what we understand the offer was too good and he chose to accept (we estimate that he took about an $80,000 a year pay raise). He wrote up a gut wrenching email, with a personal ~~message~~ diss for each member of his staff one day in the summer and with that he was gone.

Almost immediately the staff's spirit started to wane. There was no way anyone would be able to replace our old boss - we knew that, but we weren't expecting someone with a completely opposite management style. The last thing she'd want to do is socialize with the teachers outside of the work environment. She'd constantly be checking up on her staff, offering vague and mostly useless ""suggestions"". When we called for help, she'd some times would side with the parents or the students. Over the course of the next three years or so, scores dropped, smiles disappeared, happy hours became a depressing ""share why your work week sucked"" therapy sessions. Alcohol was a way to numb our pain rather than to celebrate with friends.

It's been about five years now, and I've since quit teaching. A ton of the teachers at the old staff, for one reason or another, transferred over to the school where my old boss is currently running.

I'm always greeted with a smile, and a sly: ""Who let this fucking loser in."" He'll ask me about PhD things, just so he can make fun of how nerdy I am. And I love it.

Plenty of women have kids and are also very successful in other areas of life, however you define ""success."" Your negative attitude towards motherhood may indicate some deeper concerns or issues that you need to explore and figure out, especially because you are now pregnant.

Personally I also got pregnant at 25 (on purpose) and I chose to stay home with my baby rather than continue working. But I could have put her in daycare instead and stayed at my job if I wanted to. For me, giving her one-on-one care while she's a baby is more important to me than staying at my job.

I think you should check out /r/babybumps and /r/beyondthebump and look for moms who are in similar situations as you. Ask how they balance work and motherhood, or school and motherhood, or whatever it is you're concerned about.

This is a tricky question.  Honestly, if there were a way to guarantee the destruction of every firearm on earth, and the technology to create them, I would support it.

That's not going to happen though, they'll always be around.  My issue with the current debate is that the popular 'gun-control' ideas are focused on taking *away* all the firearms.  Cool, but it's completely ineffectual.  What's the problem: criminals killing people.  The 'take em all away' solution really only takes them away from people like me, who like to shoot them for sport and hunting.  You'll never get them away from the people who really want to do harm with them though.

An analogy is like the prison systems.  Meth and heroin are illegal in the US, but they can't even keep it out of **Federal Prisons**.  Same goes for guns, sure you can ban them, but a criminal with 2 brain cells will still find a way to get a hold of one.

Now, you're in germany where the culture is a lot different.  There aren't many firearms in circulation and the ones that are, are very tightly regulated.  Awesome.  The US's problem is that there are *so many friggin* guns here, that trying to control them is not going to net even close to the same effect as you experience in Germany, or Sweden.  Also the majority of gun violence happens in areas of very poor people, with regards to income and social health.  You don't see drive bys happening in Martha's vinyard.  Gun violence is really more of a social problem than people think, but they don't want to consider that.  Helping the poor socially disenfranchised people is not as easy as saying ""guns are bad.""

Also most of the focus is on the AR 'military' style weapons.  Factually, long guns (that includes ALL rifles, militart and non) account for &lt;10% of all firearm related violence.  Handguns are the predominant culprits here, but nobody likes to talk about that because it's a lot easier to hate an AR-15 (I don't know the statistic but AR pattern rifles I believe accounted for less than 2% of gun-violence).

I could go on forever, but you get the idea.  

&gt; you are required to get a license and special tests, you have to keep them secured in a safe etc

I wish the US would adopt these policies.  No reason not to, but if someone suggests it, they're automatically pro-gun.  And with our retarded political system, pro-gun = pro violence = ignorant redneck = school shooting supporter.  Sad but that's how it goes.

Anyhoo, whew.  Googled your grandpa, those rifles are AWESOME."

We told each other we weren't allowed to text for at least a month (I broke this a couple of times) but I honestly think that was the best thing for me.

I had a really good cry that night, though. I let it all out until my body was dehydrated and wouldn't even produce any more tears. Went to sleep.

Next day I felt free. Suddenly I can do whatever I want and there's no one there to tell me I should or shouldn't do something. If I want to go on a trip to see an old friend, I can do that. If I want to get a tattoo while I'm there, I can fucking do it. And I did. I started partying with friends and enjoying my teenage years.

I've since found someone else, someone better. Someone I love to death. You just have to give it some time before they'll come along, but when they do you'll be so full of joy that you can hardly contain yourself. I can't even remember why I ""loved"" my first. He made me hate my body and his best friends were all females (one main one) who I was extremely jealous of, but he didn't care. He actually forced me to be okay with him staying the night at her house, more than once. Fuck him.

This depends on a lot of things. My child(ren) are too young for school and do not attend daycare. If they did I would try my hardest to find a daycare or private care giver that required vaccinations.

At school age, most children are big enough and have strong enough immune systems that if they were to catch whooping cough from some kid who brought it to school with them, they would be down for a few days, but would be ok. But this changes if the school age child has a younger sibling that is too young to be vaccinated or very small in general.

At some point, a certain amount of chance has to be taken. Kids are going to get sick, regardless. We have to do our best as care givers to make sure everyone has good hand washing habits, knows to sneeze and cough into their elbows, and knows not to kiss and hug on people who are sick."

i think the biggest thing to find out is specifically what your responsibility will be day-to-day.  mic wrangling?  building monitor / foh world? etc

pay is tough to answer as it varies by region but generally speaking, it's often a weekly rate that is approximately your standard day rate x the number of shows per week minus a little bit.  it's not uncommon to get a little less than day rate x 7 on tour if it's calculated weekly.  but ask for what you think you deserve.

only red flags i'd really watch out for is money and if it looks like your responsibilities will be disproportionate to your pay.

i have quite a bit of touring w bands but not much w theater, so take my advice w a grain of salt.  good luck!"

Obviously I had to look up the exact declarations, but yes I was aware that mainstream feminism has never supported a male-only draft. Current pushes from feminists to allow women in the military in increasingly varied roles is a continuation of this movement.

Edit: And yes, if you quoted a single example of a fringe feminist or small feminist coalition saying something ridiculous, I would not take that seriously.

zhrusk,explainlikeIAmA,1390937861.0,"**Item #:** SCP-3946-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

[Invalidated as of ███████].

[Invalidated as of ███████].

[Invalidated as of ███████].

**Revised Containment Procedures:** As of this update, SCP-3946-J is re-classified as Keter due to the difficulty of containing SCP-3946-J.

Any sightings or evidence of SCP-3946-J, SCP-3946-J-1, or SCP-3946-J-2 are to be reported immediately to the current head of Site 19 immediately. At least 10 plainclothes agents should be dispatched to the area to prevent SCP-3946-J-1 from obtaining whatever rogue SCP exists in the area. ~~Communication with SCP-3946-J-1 is to be supervised by at least three (3) Level 4 Personnel.~~ Communication with SCP-3946-J-1 should be done with plainclothes SCP agents. Under no circumstances should SCP-3946-J be informed of the SCP's presence.  If SCP-3946-J-1 is ever sighted twice consecutively without SCP-3946-J-2, enact protocol 3946-J-A.

**Description:** SCP-3946-J is a British police telephone box, consistent in size and coloring  with the style of boxes built in the late 1920's. The doors of SCP-3946-J can only be opened by SCP-3946-J-1. When opened, SCP-3946-J appears to contain a space much larger than the dimensions of the box. The appearance of the inside of SCP-3946-J varies from sighting to sighting, but always contains a central tower surrounded by various levers and buttons.

SCP-3946-J appears and disappears seemingly at random, but tends to favor appearing near other unconstrained SCP's.  Once appearing, SCP-3946-J extrudes one to two entities, SCP-3946-J-1 and (usually, but not always) SCP-3946-J-2. If SCP-3946-J-2 is not seen for 2 consecutive appearances of SCP-3946-J-1, enact protocol 3946-J-A.

SCP-3946-J-1 is a male humanoid. The appearance of SCP-3946-J-1 varies from sighting to sighting, but has maintained one of ~~10~~ ~~11~~ ~~12~~ 13 different appearances.

SCP-3946-J-1 is hostile towards SCP operatives, but is friendly towards normal individuals. When facing hostile individuals, SCP-3946-J-1 will begin speaking to those individuals. The content of the speech varies from occurrence to occurrence; SCP-3946-J-1 may attempt to dissuade hostiles from harming it, or it may deliver a lengthy, convoluted speech with no apparent purpose (other than to distract the hostiles and thus prevent them from taking action). Whatever the content of the speech, SCP-3946-J-1 is consistently able to prevent harm to itself (and SCP-3946-J-2) simply by speaking.

Current theories postulate that SCP-3946-J-1's speech is a low-level cognitohazard that renders individuals hostile to SCP-3946-J-1 unable to harm it. However, no controlled tests to prove this theory have yet been possible, due to the difficulty inherent in containment of SCP-3946-J-1 (and the chaotic nature of most non-contained interactions with SCP-3946-J-1)

SCP-3946-J-1 is also capable of producing devices from any pockets it currently possesses. Devices range from wands capable of altering reality to documents proclaiming SCP-3946-J-1 to belong to the SCP foundation. 

SCP-3946-J-1 will attempt to secure any rogue SCP's in the area. Any SCP's secured by SCP-3946-J-1 are taken back into SCP-3946-J, which then dissapears. Nothing is known of what happens to any rogue SCP's taken by SCP-3946-J, but due to the Keter classification of SCP-3946-J and it's hostility towards the Foundation, agents are granted allowances when preventing SCP-3946-J-1 to obtaining any rogue SCP's.

SCP-3946-J-2 is a female humanoid. The appearance of SCP-3946-J-2 various from sighting to sighting, but tends to take the appearance and personality of the last individual who stepped into SCP-3946-J (See protocol 3946-J-A).

**Protocol 3946-J-A:** Should SCP-3946-J-1 be sighted without SCP-3946-J-2 on two or more consecutive appearances, agents should locate a female human between the ages of 20-30. For best results, the female should maintain a ""spunky, go-getter attitude"" and be attractive according to current social norms. The female should be mind-wiped of all SCP knowledge and placed within a metropolitan city with a suitable Euclid-class SCP that is capable of being retrieved. In most cases, once the female has been threatened by the released SCP, SCP-3946-J will appear. Once SCP-3946-J has extruded SCP-3946-J-1 and dealt with the ""rogue"" SCP, the female will enter SCP-3946-J and be transformed into SCP-3946-J-2. The euclid SCP should be retrieved if possible. For this reason, only low-risk SCP's should be used for protocol 3946-J-A.

*Warning:* Should Protocol 3946-J-A not be enacted, SCP-3946-J-1 will become increasingly hostile and irresponsible in it's attempts to contain rogue SCP's.Due to the world-altering power of SCP-3946-J-1 and it's various devices, this could result in a Keter-class end of the world scenario.

travelingmama,BabyBumps,1390937884.0,"The best thing you can do in my opinion is walk walk walk. It gives you warm up contractions that exercise your uterus so even if it doesn't trigger labor it will still prepare you for labor. Unfortunately you don't go into labor naturally until the baby releases a hormone that indicates their lungs are finished developing so it won't induce labor, but if the baby is ready then it will. The night before my kids were born I had gone on a big long walk. Seriously, both times. Once I hit 37 weeks I just start walking like crazy! I'm convinced that it made my labor more effective with my second because I did it a lot more. "
communistslutblossom,AskWomen,1390937887.0,"Hmmm. I cut my hair short when I was 15, so it's hard for me to compare peoples' reactions to me from before and after my haircut, because between 15 and 20, of course many things have changed in the way I present myself and the way people perceive me. 

I know I get waaay more compliments on my hair now than I did with long hair, and I do get the ""I could never pull it off thing."" I know that can be a veiled insult, but I usually don't interpret it that way. I think a lot of  women who say that really mean that they've considered short hair and sincerely don't believe they would look very good with it, or that they're scared. 

I've also never had anyone tell me that I looked better with long hair, but again, I was 15, so I just didn't look as put-together in general when I had longer hair. "

23skiddsy,TumblrInAction,1390937987.0,"Pair bonding and monogamy are pretty important in most birds, ducks included. Generally, raped ducks don't make terribly successful mothers (also, female ducks have anti-rape maze vaginas). The rapist ducks are the ones that didn't get picked by a female to begin with, so they try and reproduce by force.

But there are many species that have ""rapey"" males that use ...non-traditional tactics in order to reproduce. They usually aren't as successful, but they try. Sea lions are a good example. I am always wary about applying the word rape in these situations, though. Applying human sexuality to other species is generally a bad idea.

Good sex is a combination of a couple of things: chemistry and skill. Chemistry you can't predict, and skill you develop over time.

There might be some women out there who have got the skill and are willing to teach you, but I'm guessing you want your partner to be virginal too...? ""The blind leading the blind"" is no longer the social norm.

Personally I would assume -- if you have been capable of waiting this long -- that your sex drive was nowhere near as high as mine, or that you weren't actually interested in women at all. Both dealbreakers.

You should probably restrict your dating pool to religious communities, maybe enlist some elder/matchmaking help there."

To your credit, you are working to empathize with his feelings of rejection and anxiety even when you're suffering from those feelings yourself -- GOOD FOR YOU. That is huge. I hope he is able to do the same in return.

I wonder if the Karezza (sidebar on the right) approach might work for you two to start? Or if not that formal approach, just something more staged -- getting used to touching each other, being naked in each other's presence, with sex off the table.

If you're both motivated to change your marriage together it can really work.

Kayge,toronto,1390938845.0,"I'm assuming this is one a few (or only) suits, so take this as some catchall advice:  

The suit is important but isn't the thing that will make or break how you look.  While there's a difference between a $250 suit and a $2,000 suit, if you're able to hit the midrange of that - say $600 to $800 - what will matter more is the fit.  

If you're looking in that area, try:  

 - Tom's (you'll need to negoitate)  
 - Harry Rosen (if they're having a sale)  
 - The higher end of Tip Top / Moore's  

Find one that's the right colour dark blue / charcoal grey are a good start.  You can wear them for pretty much anything, and repeated wearings won't raise any flags.  Get one that suits your style (go traditional to start) and fits you.  

Now comes the important part:  Go to a tailor (allocate $100 to this; most good stores will have tailors on staff).  Get it taken in if you can, get the sleeves fitted and anything else that can be *tweaked*.  That last $100 you spend will make a world of difference."

kowalski71,projectcar,1390939292.0,"The vast majority of the actual 'ricing' and accessories will be reversible, at some cost. Most bolt on components are easily removable. However major body mods (spoilers and some body kits) will have damaged or put holes in panels, though filling holes is relatively easy. Everything else (under glow, interior mods, stickers, etc) are easy enough.

The big things to worry about are performance mods and maintenance. In my experience, this attitude towards owning a car doesn't encourage conscientious maintenance so the car might just be abused. It's also likely been driven very hard. Performance modifications can be great if they were done well.

For example, if a car has a big turbo, a cheap ECU chip, and a cold air intake then there's a good chance it's producing more horsepower than the lower end can reasonably handle and it'll soon fall apart. One highly modded car I was considering buying (a 2nd gen DSM) had a lower end and head rebuild with quality forged internals but relatively few horsepower mods. It was clearly built as a good, unbreakable engine to start improving on with turbos or other mods.

A good rule of thumb is receipts and spreadsheets. Most guys I know who are doing extensive modifications are documenting them quite well. There may be a build thread somewhere but ideally they have an Excel doc of every mod, cost, and some other info and receipts for most of it. This isn't always the case but look at whatever documentation and knowledge they have."

EByrne,AskWomen,1390939780.0,"I agree, but would also add that for both men and women, sometimes people accept friendship as a consolation prize when the attraction is not reciprocated. Sometimes they bail once you make it clear that the feelings aren't mutual and never will be, which is understandable. Sometimes they decide that they'd like to try to be your friend, and that's cool too. Sometimes they then go and complain to all of their friends that I'm an idiot for not seeing what's standing right in front of me. That's not so cool, although it doesn't happen anymore now that I have a girlfriend. 

In short, it goes both ways, and I think a common motivation is that a lot of people agree to friendships simply because they're better than nothing. For people who start as friends, though, I agree that men are way more likely to get mixed up and see a romantic connection where their friend sees only a close, emotionally intimate friend."

Its legal, and where I live the tax people assume a 20 percent tip rate above your minimum wage no matter what you declare.

France for instance outside of the US, has no tipping, but wait staff are more professional and are paid better. I am sure there are many different customs worldwide such as a service charge right on the bill no matter the quality of service.

Also it is mean to down tip in many cases because the wait staff is dependent on the cook doing a great job, the support staff supporting as required.  If I get bad service, bad food. T tip the minimum (15%) and do not repeat the error of going there.

Now for your treat...I checked a ton of shipping prices for indies and a lot of them would eat most of your budget. Femme Fatale does free sample shipping worldwide but their samples are pretty tiny although if you're interested in duochrome eyeshadows that would probably be your best bet. Victorian Disco also has a flat rate of $2-3 for sample shipping worldwide but I think you've already tried them so I'm not sure if you're looking for a repeat. 

Do you happen to wear perfume? A blogger based in the UK uses some stuff from Future Primitive Soap Co. which is also based in the UK and has 3.50 GBP flat rate shipping. There are some perfume samples [here](http://futureprimitivesoap.bigcartel.com/product/aromatic-oil-samples-you-choose) and they say they refund the difference in shipping as the perfume samples are quite light. I'm not sure how much shipping is in the UK but I think that means you can definitely get 1 sample or maybe 2. I know that it's also stocked in some brick-and-mortar stores so if there are any close to you then you might be able to snag a few in person and skip the shipping altogether.  

You might also consider doing some pressing of any loose shadows you already have as that could be a fun project. An empty palette on eBay is fairly cheap [here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2012-Empty-Eyeshadow-Case-Aluminum-Pans-with-Palette-New-26mm-15Grid-/131085151389?pt=US_Makeup_Eyes&amp;hash=item1e8548ac9d) and you can get glycerin + rubbing alcohol at the grocery store with everything hopefully being under the budget or very close to it (also you maybe having rubbing alcohol already? Is that cheating?). /u/iwontremeberthis has pressed some pretty tri-colored pans too with sample sizes! :) 

As for the prize, if chosen by you or the reddit raffle gods (10percent by the way--congrats again!!!) I'd be excited to receive anything off my wishlist and I just checked to make sure there are a handful of items that total &lt;$10 with shipping!

Drabby,quityourbullshit,1390940785.0,"That's an interesting question. In my opinion, there were a lot of factors that contributed to the relative lack of emphasis on equality in the draft. Prior to World War II, it was extremely uncommon for women to work outside the home. Even military desk and secretarial jobs for women were a difficult sell to the American populace.

Around the time of the Korean and Vietnam war, feminist movements often cooperated with the anti-war movements. They mostly argued against the draft itself, rather than arguing for inclusion of women. Could some of the reluctance to push for women in the draft be fear of going to battle? It's certainly possible. It's also impossible to disentangle that fear from the true idealists and conscientious objectors protesting the draft. At any rate, the idea that eliminating the draft was the best solution diluted any efforts to push for women being included in the draft.

It's also my impression that many people in that era considered that men were primarily responsible for starting wars, and that men primarily were the benefactors of winning wars. Therefore it was not the responsibility of women to be involved in the violence - only to provide support at home, in factories, in propaganda, etc. This is an unfair argument, as the men who are drafted are not at all the same men who started or benefited from the war. It's an argument that seems to have influenced some feminists, and would have convinced those particular feminists that addressing the draft was not a priority. But it was NOT exclusive to them. It was also a popular point of view among anti-feminists who argued for separate spheres for men and women.

Anyhow, that's my understanding of the issue. For now I should actually do some non-internet things, so if you want to continue the debate I'll be back sometime later."

That being said, I think it's incredibly important for women/girls (and boys and men too!) to learn to say no at an early age. We want to be sensitive to people's feelings and develop social intelligence along the way. We shouldn't be afraid to hide our feelings at the risk of hurting someone else's and we should be given the skills along the way to be able to prevent that from happening in a myriad of situations. Being able to say no is empowering. We shouldn't be taking that power away. "

I can't totally explain my motivations, since I'm not totally sure what they are, but that's just what's always worked for me. When I'm single, I devote most of my social time to developing friendships. If I hook up with a woman, it begins and ends as a hookup; this isn't the path to a relationship with me. 

At some point while I'm single, I become particularly close to one of the women that I'm friends with (it happens unpredictably, since I'm usually not looking for it), and then I realize that I'm attracted to her and want more. Sometimes she feels the same way, and we end up together. Sometimes she doesn't, and that's fine too. I can accept when someone isn't attracted to me, and after a while things go back to some semblance of normal.

One thing that I can say, though, is that I don't develop friendships for the sole purpose of moving on to a relationship. There may be some element of interest there, but in every case I'd be totally fine with being exclusively friends. Then again, I've also never accused anyone of friend-zoning me, so maybe I'm not really who you're talking about. "

This is done from the perspective of a Blood DK (that's what I tank on - can't speak as much to the other classes, but the basics are still the same)

Perhaps I can help a little...
Don't be afraid of tanking LFR - if you've done the fights - go ahead and jump in...
Most of the fights in SoO are just tank swaps - so basically ask the main tank how many stacks to swap at and just taunt when they get that many stacks. The way I keep track - just focus the other tank and watch their debuffs for when to taunt. I recommend - especially if you're at a lower gear level (entry/LFR gear) make a macro that says:  
/rw Taunting %t now  
/ra Taunting %t now  
this just lets the healers know you are taunting (I believe DBM or another addon has the ability to do this as well. (I usually do it in raid warning, in LFR as a tank you should automatically be assist, if you're not just ask to be made one)


Quick fight overview from tank's perspective:  
**Immerseus**  
Taunt at 1 stack of corrosive blast. You can't stand next to each other - it's a breath aoe. Also make sure you're moving out of sha puddles, personally I pick a platform and just move back and forth across the front of it (kinda of like a typewriter) Once you get to his 3rd/4th split (depending on DPS) you won't need to taunt anymore for the most part (he won't cast the spell more than once)
Dps the little adds when he splits. Cast AMS for some free runic power when the little adds blow up.


**Fallen Protectors**  
You'll be tanking either Rook or He here. If you're tanking Rook, just make sure you're pointing him away from the raid, and pick up Misery when the adds come (most LFR groups don't even worry about tanking adds, but it's a good habit to get into). Rook will stun you and punch, you want to make sure you Death Strike shortly before this and he won't even eat through your blood shield usually. If you don't get off the death strike, you should still be ok, just hit it immediately after. If you really need it - IBF breaks stun (should work here, but never actually had reason to try it so don't quote me on this).
If you're tanking He, things are a little different. Make sure you move out of poison on the ground. When he goes to cast gouge (if you have DBM, it will alert you and your screen will flash reddish) you need to turn your back to him. This will prevent the gouge and he will punt you forward a few feet. Then just turn back around and continue tanking him. He will also shadowstep behind you sometimes, just turn around and face him (I find myself moving around a lot when I tank him). You should also be picking up the 2 non-gloom adds (I forget the names - misery and something else?)
For both bosses, you still need to be inside the bubble for dark meditation - for He, just face him towards the raid with your back to the raid, putting him outside the bubble and you right inside (he has no frontal aoe or anything to worry about). For Rook - try to place him so the raid is beside or behind him (depending where they are stacked) and yourself just inside the bubble facing him at least alongside the raid (some people might get hit by fists this way, try to minimize it if possible)


**Norushen**  
You'll be swapping at 3-5 stacks. In LFR, since the ""portals"" to get cleansed are random, make sure you're paying attention in case the other tank gets ported. Also, you should try to have the cleansed tank on the boss as much as possible. Once you're cleansed as the tank, try to make sure you're picking up the orbs that drop when the big adds are killed, you getting back more of the debuff isn't a problem like it is for the DPS...


**Sha of Pride**  
I've ALWAYS solo tanked this on LFR. If you're tanking - turn the boss so you're standing in front of the prison (he will only use one of them on the tank side on LFR) and just step backwards onto the glowing thing when someone is prisoned) I usually have the offtank just go DPS here and stand up front with me to help with prisons


**Galakras**  
Your best bet here will be tanking the bottom until you're more comfortable with it. For the bottom, grab the adds and group them up to die. Drag them down the hill a bit and the NPCs will help (the AOE is a good spot). I tend to drag whatever adds I have up to the demolishers so that they can be cleaved down with the demo as well.
If you're tanking the towers, after the Demo dies, you'll run up the tower and get aggro on the adds, you need to move out of the ability the guy on top does (forget the name - it's a ""titanic smash"" type ability) so you don't get punted off the tower.
For the boss himself, swap at (I believe 3) stacks and make sure you point him away from raid.


**Iron Juggernaut**  
Fairly simple tank swap, you'll need to run in and out. Make sure you tank him somewhere that you won't get punted very far, and the raid has somewhere to stand that they won't get punted far either (let the other tank choose if he's done it before).


**Kor'kron Dark Shaman**
This one is interesting for tanks. In LFR you generally just 2 tank this. Each of you take one of them, and at 3ish stacks of the debuff from the male one, you swap targets. Takes a little coordination (might want to use the macro above). While you're taunting back and forth, you will also be moving the bosses around as well to get out of AOE This can also be done with 3 tanks, it's a bit easier to coordinate, but you need a 3rd person with gear to be able to tank it. Two of the tanks take the male shaman (forget their names) up the hill (towards the next encounter a little). They usually bring along 2-3 healers and all the melee dps (easier on melee to be up there, very little movement). Then for this guy it's just a simple tank swap and positioning the ashen walls.  
For the tank on the chick, just kite her around avoiding aoe and have the ranged kill her (and move to avoid bad stuff of course)

**General Nazgrim**  
Simple tank swap. Taunt at 4ish stacks of sunder. (edited for comments) Since it was brought up in the comments. You can/should get adds if you can - on LFR I've found that the adds tend to die by the time I get there or are usually so low it doesn't matter. On any difficulty higher than LFR, you will need to tank the adds. Also, at around 10-15% (depending on group) the tank who is not tanking the boss will generally run around and corral the add and pull them to the corner so everyone can just focus on the boss. Run and grab the adds if you can, if you find them dying before you even get there, just stay at the boss


**Malkorok**  
uses a ""titanic smash"" ability. In LFR you can almost ignore this, but it's good practice to be moving around the boss to avoid it anyways. No need to swap or anything here


**Spoils of Pandaria**  
This might be my least favorite fight to tank. People will think you're going to slow and open boxes for you. They will screw you up in every way you can imagine. Just go with it. I generally try to open a couple small boxes with a boss or a couple medium together. Keep doing this and it'll go down. You'll get into a rhythm eventually. You'll be taunting a bit on this as well as people will get excited and open the boxes for you. Try beforehand to cut this off by asking people to let you be the only one to open, hopefully they listen to you.


**Thok the Bloodthirsty**  
Tank swap at 3 stacks. You can't stand with the other tank - you need to run in and out to swap. When he's in his phase where he's focusing people - go tank the jailer and stay out of the boss's way. Easy fight to tank. In the final phase make sure you're moving him around to get out of fire and give the melee room to DPS.


**Siegecrafter Blackfuse**  
You're going to taunt every time one of the big adds spawns. When the other tank taunts off you, you're going to run and pick up the add. DPS the add yourself, and put it in the bad stuff that spawns in the room (fire works best IMO, but the blades and such work fine). Try to get the DPS and such to refrain from hitting the magnet so you have saw blades to work with.


**Paragons of the Klaxxi**  
There are pairs of these that shouldn't be tanked together. Honestly though on LFR, just pick one, and when yours is killed, taunt the next one to come down. Generally you'll be ok. Ask the other tank for help - I don't remember offhand the exact order here (it doesn't matter all that much in LFR what order you tank them in - you should be able to survive anything they hit you with)


**Garrosh**  
If you're on the boss, tank him in the middle of the room. Run out of iron stars - tank swap on the later phases when he's putting up the debuff on the tank.
If you're doing the adds in phase 1, you want to group them up, then sit them where the iron star will be (gorefiend's grip helps with this a bit) without being in the star yourself. For your first few times at least, I would glyph Anti-Magic Shell for this fight, that way you take 0 damage from the star, you'll just get punted. EVentually you will get a feel for where to place them that they get hit but you don't.
For the ""teleport"" phases, just hit up the other tank and work out who's going left or right and stick with that


Hope this helps you feel a little more comfortable!


Feel free to hit me up if you want some more help - I'll help out as best I can!
have fun tanking!

LeBatEnRouge,AskWomen,1390941502.0,"""There’s an old rule men learn about flirting with women: if a woman’s pretty, don’t expect to impress her by telling her so. People have been telling her that every single day since puberty, and it no longer even registers as anything other than background noise.

On the other hand, most men have never been told they’re pretty. Or attractive at all. We’re supposed to derive value from our success and careers, not our looks, and there is an overwhelming cultural narrative that we are the wanter, not the wanted, the pursuer, not the pursued, the desiring, not the desirable.

Tell a man (other than Ryan Gosling) that he’s pretty, and you will have his undivided attention. You may well be the first person ever to say that to him. Do not assume that an attractive man knows he’s attractive. The opposite is probably the case.""

1. It's written and directed by the Coen brothers. Their names should be brands, like Walt Disney or Ghibli. (but not like Tyler Perry...)

2. It's like *The Odyssey*. It's a lot like *The Odyssey*, complete with Sirens, a vengeful god, and a man competing to be his wife's suitor.

3. They sing ""You Are My Sunshine"" at the end.

4. The characters are easy to love and hate. You'll really hate some characters. Some characters you will love.

5. When you hear those little girls sing and say the word ""bonafide"" it'll melt your heart.

EByrne,AskWomen,1390941686.0,"Question for the women: do you remember the first time that you were friends with a guy, and really enjoyed his company, but you just weren't attracted to him? When he went and made a move, and you had to turn him down, remember how bad you felt? Did you learn anything from the experience? Well, my theory is that a lot of guys--the same guys who complain about being friend-zoned--never really went through that.

In high school, I was attracted a girl who was a friend of mine. In my eyes, I was perfect for her. We had a lot of the same interests, we were both attractive, we enjoyed each other's company, spent a ton of time together, and genuinely enjoyed each other's company. So why was she interested in a guy who was objectively less compatible with her than I was? I struggled with that thought for a good amount of time.

About a month later, it became clear that another girl that I was friends with was interested in me. She would wait for me in the hallways, laugh at literally everything I said, invent reasons to be wherever I was, etc. Since I was 17 and basically an idiot when it came to women, the point wasn't really driven home until I gave her a ride to work one day. I pulled into the lot, we chatted for a bit, and she opened the door to leave. But before she got out of the car, she leaned over and kissed me. 

I was stunned, and had no idea what to make of it. She was a great friend, and we spent a lot of time together, shared a ton of interests, and enjoyed each other's company. And she was an attractive girl, no less. Objectively, I probably should have been attracted to her... but I wasn't. 

I did my best to let her down easy, and to her credit, she really just understood that the attraction wasn't there. She made it really easy for me, and I was grateful for that. We're still friends, and years later actually dated for a bit, before our careers took us in different directions. 

Luckily for me, this experience gave me a good deal of perspective into what my other friend--the one that I was attracted to--must be feeling. I realized that she just wasn't attracted to me, and there wasn't necessarily a reason for it. It wasn't a personal failing of mine, and it wasn't something that she owed me an explanation for. If it isn't there, it isn't there. With my new found perspective, I was able to accept that and move on, and as a result we're still good friends more than a decade later. 

If I hadn't had the experience of being on the other end of the situation--having a friend develop feelings for me that I didn't return--I'm not sure if I ever would have developed the perspective to understand how to handle it. I also think that most women experienced that predicament at some point in their younger years, which gives them the perspective to handle lack of attraction from a friend. I think that far fewer guys have this experience in their formative years, and it shows. "

I know that I should consult my doctor about any decisions regarding my medication and thank you for reiterating that. I appreciate all the feedback though there are a few things I am not quite sure about...

While I included anecdotal information from my own experiences, I don't recall asking about the side effects of any medication in this post. Is that the only rule I've broken? I was very vague in what sort of responses I wish to elicit as I didn't want to limit any sort of input - I actually don't think I asked any questions.

In regard to taking my medication irregularly, I explicitly mentioned in this post that I avoided taking it daily. It's not uncommon for people to take their medication on weekends to maintain efficiency and this behavior was actually encouraged by my doctor.

While I do frequent drug-related subreddits, I do not abuse my medication and the post that you linked to regarding my irregular use reinforces that - note the part about delaying refilling my medication having accumulated an excess.

I'm not sure what about my post came across as ""medication-trolling"" behaviour as these are all legitimate concerns. I treasure this subreddit for all the help that it has provided and continues to provide. I'm bothered that how I conduct myself is perceived this way. I hope that you can expand on that so that I may communicate in a more effective manner in the future.

Now? I'm fine, healthy, w/e. Acne is still around, but I found the underlying issues of my depression and fixed them. You should do the same.


Seriously, seek out some therapy. Worst case scenario is that the acne persists for most of your life--you need to be able to deal with that. I know its terrible to think about it, but believe me, you can actually cope well enough to where that thought stops scaring you. You become at peace with it. Please find a professional to talk to.


Now, for some more practical advice. You may not be able to find a treatment that works well for a long time, so what to do then? Make up. Yes, I know you're a guy, and only girls wear make up, whatever. A good concealer or foundation will NOT be detectable, and will cover up your acne and make your acne not very visible.

Now, that means you need to suck it up, go to a make up counter and ask for them to match your skin for you. Yes, I know it's uncomfortable, and yes, I know that means you kind of have to admit to a stranger that your acne is so bad that you, a boy, need to wear make up. But that one day will change the rest of your life. You'll be able to go outside. Please seriously consider this. I know society has made you believe that wearing make up is ridiculous, but it's not really ""make up"". It's not eyeliner, it's not lipstick, it's a product that you put on your face, and it makes your acne invisible. Think of foundation as a kind of lotion, and it seems less scary.


Make up changed my life. When I was little (middle school) and acne hit I would also refuse to go outside. If relatives came around, I would scream at my mom for making me say hi to them. I was so ashamed that I would literally stay in my room all day, not even wanting my parents to see me. When I was in school, I would be extremely antisocial when my acne flared up because I didn't want to burden anyone with having to look at my face. I've been there. I've done all that.


I'm 21 now, and life is amazing. But life wasn't always amazing.


PM me if you're considering everything, I'll personally help you work out the make up stuff. Seriously consider it, please!"

I don't recall the system the daily show uses specifically (there was a guy on reddit who talked about it at one point), but I know some guys who work at a company that is now Cisco on one of the products for this sort of thing.  Basically they have a giant cable box that records huge volumes of TV data, with multiple channels at  once,  and then creates a searchable database of all of the subtitle information.  You can then search through the huge video archive based on subtitles and pull out clips.


It used to be that to do this you needed basically a large collection of of TIVO's all recording like crazy, though now I believe the machines basically record 30 or so channels at once.

""Assault rifles"" are specifically military grade, fully automatic rifles.  Getting a full auto in the states is incredibly difficult;

- Very hard to find one for sale

- Expect to pay upwards of $25,000 - $30,000 for one.

- You have to get special permission (and pay $thousands, maybe hundreds, but still a bit) for ATF approval, and they have 1000x more discretion than a typical background check.  Having one too many speeding tickets might knock you off (I'm serious).  Also those special stamps have almost a year waiting list after you submit.

Now I know this isn't what you meant, but for the sake of my original argument this fits pretty well.  You made a statement about firearms, that while well meaning, was completely silly.  You didn't know what you were talking about, and that's what I want to educate people on.  Therefore they can still oppose guns, but know what they're talking about while doing it.

The thing is that with pregnancy, you're still just getting bigger in the stomach, it's disproportionate, so it's still obvious when your stomach is bigger than the rest of you. 

Now, of course, the answer would depend on what you mean by ""bigger"". I'm obese. I'm not like, MASSIVELY obese, but I started my pregnancy much bigger than I should have and just kept getting bigger."

the_number_2,AskReddit,1390943569.0,"&gt; I think everyone should work in food service at least once in there life.

Agreed, food service or grocery store. Both typical high-school jobs, both with unreasonably high customer expectations, both made or broken by the quality of the supervisors and management.

I worked in the Osco side of a Jewel-Osco store (Albertson's-owned chain in the Midwest). Some nights were awful, supervisors up your ass, customers that are so damn demanding and not understanding that, although we're in the same building, Jewel (grocery) and Osco (pharmacy, liquor, greeting cards, makeup, etc) we are completely separate as far as employees go, so don't get mad at me that I don't know where your specific brand of dog food is outside of saying ""it should be in Aisle 4"". They don't train us for that.

Slow nights we had the laid back manager. As long as the store looked nice, there really wasn't any work to do, so ""15 minute breaks"" usually involved me driving to the local Chinese take-out to pick up an order and sitting on break with the crew for a few hours.

I liked that job and hated it, but damned if it didn't pay great (~9.25 in 2004)"

systemlord,RealEstate,1390943625.0,"Read and understand the lease in full, it protects BOTH of us.  If you don't understand an item, I'll be glad to explain it to you.

Pay rent in full and on time.  I don't care what your excuse is, I've heard them all.  I feel like I need to repeat this, if your car broke, if you got fired from your job, you have medical bills, problems with the kids, honestly, its not my problem and I don't care.  I've got my own issues to worry about.  Pay in full and on time, or get out.  If you stay without paying, I *will* evict you.  Then I will sue you for whatever monies owed.

If you trash or break the property, let me know asap so that the problem doesn't grow.  You will pay for it either way.  Its in your best interest to let me know asap so that you don't end up paying more in the end.

Reading this, it may come off as somebody trying to be a ""bad-ass landlord"", but that couldn't be further from the truth.

Its simple, a tenant can cause you thousands of dollars worth of damage, and then some.  The same way that a landlord can ruin your credit-score, and your chances of ever renting from a reputable source again, and then there is wage-garnishing and a hole host of uncomfortable things than a landlord can make happen.  

So, the bottom line goes back to my first point.  Read the lease and understand it.  Everything is explained there.  This is strictly a business deal, where both parties get something out of it.  You get a habitable roof over your head, and I get rent money.  Break the lease, or start not following the rules, and things can go sour real quick."

At its best its a conversation, a game.  The physical rules that govern that game are interesting.  Martial arts have also historically been used as tools by broader systems of philosophical inquiry and training, and as such I think there is a certain importance to understanding conflict.

I also see no inherit nobility in being a victim.  I study martial arts and I would never seek out a fight.  Its antithetical to everything I've been taught about when and how to use the skills I've been developing.

And many show breeders DO breed for health, temperament, and smarts before they breed for appearances, not all, of course, but a large portion of the dog fancy. 

Smaller (by which I mean less populous) breeds also tend to have much fewer health problems. Your average Black Russian Terrier is going to have fewer health problems than your average Rottie.

cfedey,MonsterHunter,1390944115.0,"Well, the damage is much more complex than that. Let me try to explain:

With Rapid, the first arrow does the most damage, and subsequent arrows do much less, around 25-33% of the first arrow damage.

With Spread, the middle arrow does the most, and it tends to decrease as you go farther out from the center. It's also much more forgiving than Rapid in that the arrow damage is much closer to each other.

Each arrow's damage is calculated separately, depending on where it hits, and how far the hit area is from where you are.

Charge also affects damage. A level 4 charge will do much more than a level 1."

But Favre found that playing like we played with Reus, quick Counter-attacking football just suits our current players more and after we got Raffael and Kruse, who are excellent at quick attacks, there was just no room left for De Jong.

sandrock118,httyd,1390944146.0,"lol I would venture to guess that this is how majority of this sub is. The show is not bad at all but the movie('s) are what got us hooked. It also probably has something to do with the fact that the movies are for a family audience and the show is on cartoon network so its more projected towards a much younger audience.


Also I also got extremely excited when i saw the trailer, I was almost jumping out of my seat. made it even worse that i am a guy and I was at work. luckily no one heard my muffled excitement.

Bodongs,AskWomen,1390944185.0,"&gt;Of course they don't. But isn't the point of spending time with someone new to create new experiences?  

Are you suggesting sharing past experiences is not valuable to a new relationship?

&gt;Yes, your ex is exactly what I want to hear you talk about on our first date. Please, tell me more stories about him :P.  

As lemonylips noted, straight male speaking.  

&gt;And I've found that constant mention of old relationships is a sign that they can't let the past go....Not to mention appallingly rude.   

Constant? Can't let go? Are you even having a conversation with me anymore, or are you just projecting weird fears about people's obsessions with ex's onto this now, because I'm pretty sure I laid out an example where mentioning it once off-hand as an anecdote is perfectly acceptable.  

And in reference to the second part of that...what? ""Appalling""? Really? You'd be appalled if for example, you were a few minutes late to the date because you've got a buddy who's struggling with recovery from OC addiction and needed to stay on the phone with you for a bit longer than intended, and they responded with ""Oh, that sounds difficult, my ex also struggled with opiate addiction at one point"" or if they remarked that the blue french horn hanging on the wall is almost identical to the one that a well meaning but kind of clingy ex stole for them in a misguided display of affection? You'd be APPALLED?  

The point of those two off-beat anecdotes are to display the myriad of situations that can be encompassed in the meeting of two people; to point out to you that your ""red-flag"" BS is just that, BS. That, if you are to hear a date mention, for any reason, an ex, and your initial reaction is ""UGH NOT OVER THEM, IMMATURE GOTTA GO"", that you're the one displaying a fundamental misunderstanding of conversation, relationship, human development, and emotional immaturity."

Yup, not gonna argue with that.  Unfortunately (fortunately?) their purpose has morphed into recreation *as well*.

23skiddsy,gifs,1390944388.0,"I don't know, the genetic disorder brought about by the popularity of Impressive REALLY fucked with QHs.

(I love QH hybrids, myself - but don't pretend like there haven't been problems with the horse fancy - let alone shit that they do to gaited horses)


A few dog breeds have massive health problems - but many don't. Most breeders I know use every method they can to determine that their dogs are as healthy as can be. I don't like the direction the American GSD fancy is going (GSD are much better elsewhere in the world), but that doesn't mean the entire dog fancy ignores the health and soundness of their dogs. "

You'd want to balance it so that a minimum number of units would kill it around the 15 second time out, meaning that each additional attacking unit would decrease the amount of time that the force field exists. What number of units that should be at that baseline, I don't know off the top of my head. You'd have to analyze how many zealots or lings can attack a force field at one time (depends on how it's placed I guess) and how many marines it should take etcetc.

Another aspect I just thought of, multiple force field casts would decrease the surface area of a forcefield, making it harder to kill with a ling or zealot force."

So I guess every time you fantasize about a married woman, or a woman who is out of your league, that must be a rape fantasy?  HELL NO.  Non-molesting pedophiles are not out there fantasizing about forcing someone to have sex.  Like anyone else, the pedophile, in his dreams, is looking for someone to find him desirable.

Society decides that someone is fair game for discrimination and hatred, whether that's blacks, gays or pedophiles.  They point to actions of a minority of the group to justify hating all of them.

For all of recorded history until the last 50 years, homosexuality was a paraphilia too.  I don't understand how that helps your case at all.

The reason I know her self image is off is because before we go ANYWHERE really she asks me to go up to her room and help her pick out an outfit, which is normal enough, right? No. She'll go through a minimum of 6 outfits, standing in front of the mirror whimpering and adjusting her cloths, tilting her head side to side all the while looking pained. 

She'll make comment about how she's fat under her breath, furrow her brow, sigh heavily. It's painful to watch. It makes me hurt for her. 

Sorry I went on a tangent, anyway. I feel like her not accepting the love she deserves is because she feel she doesn’t deserve any and being picky allows her not to have to explain that thought process but be equally dismissive.

**Physical.**  (pregnancy/abortion, childbirth, physical damage from childbirth (if you're a woman), potential for post partum depression, sexually transmitted diseases which can lead to discomfort, sterility, stigmatization, or death)

**Emotional.** (creating intimate ties with another person means putting yourself at risk for getting your heart broken, or at risk for being manipulated which can cause life altering/life shattering pain. Or, say it works out and you're deeply in love, that's wonderful, but it also means your life is tied to someone else's needs and wants so all decisions become joint decisions, this is not bad, but it does complicate things. And if you have a child together, the emotional changes necessary to include that child in your lives, plus all the pain, pleasure and sacrifice that comes with such a thing)

**Financial.** (An abortion can be expensive for a couple, if they are poor. A child, even more so. Illness from a disease can cause loss of work, or losing a job.)

And this is just what I can think of off the top of my head.

There are ramifications to sex that many people just don't consider before they dive into it. Either they don't want to think first, or they are not taught how to weigh the consequences and make an educated decision based on that.

That's why it becomes so much more important for the Toss player to scout well and spend money on static defense in the form of force fields exactly like a terran or zerg would. In that sense, that balances things out.

And yeah, a mid game Terran/Zerg army couldn't be totally locked by a mass of sentries, but I don't see that as much of a problem right away. It would mean that Protoss would have to think about their unit composition a little more maybe. Perhaps an earlier robo and earlier collosi? Hell, think of all the gas Protoss would have access to if they didn't make as many sentries for the late game. Faster EVERYTHING is at their fingertips. If you replace those midgame force fields with storms, I think the game is still quite balanced.

I think if the risk is different, different rates should be allowed, but at least the ruling didn't protect just one gender.

Though now that I think about it, men probably lose out overall - pensions are much more economically significant than car insurance or any other kind of insurance with gender disparities that comes to mind, and the difference in life expectancies is substantial. Also, most health insurance wasn't affected by the ruling because it's a public system, but that just means that the rates have always been unisex (in favor of women)."

Jess_than_three,pics,1390945225.0,"The tools *and the time*. Management is responsible for scheduling. Management is also responsible for directing employees with regard to cleaning responsibilities (and, you know, everything else). Management is responsible for making sure that shit gets done, and taking disciplinary action if it doesn't. Management is responsible for firing lazy employees if necessary and hiring new ones. 

As a manager in a food service environment - and I speak from experience, having done it (though not as a GM) - the buck stops with you, and if there's a problem with something like restaurant cleanliness, that is *your* problem and *you* fucked up. 

And that's just on *a shift*. The problems shown in the OP are *pervasive*, and obviously emanate from the top down. The GM is not making sure the store is getting cleaned and maintained properly, and very clearly hasn't been for months at least (and given those floors, more likely years). More bafflingly, nobody *above* them seems to have ever given a shit, either. 

Seriously, imagine you're the President of the company and you're touring your stores. You get to *this* one. When you demand to know what the fuck is going on there, are you going to accept ""Well, um, sorry, the hourly employees just aren't keeping it clean""? No. You're paying a management team to make sure they're doing what they're supposed to be doing, and you're paying a GM to make sure *they're* doing that effectively, and you're paying a regional manager to check up on stores and keep the GM in line, and you're maybe even paying another manager above *that* level to cover a broader area, and now you know why that store's numbers have been in the shitter for three years, and how the hell was this not addressed between then and now? I guarantee you that in a real-world situation, that GM would be fired immediately and the regional manager would be disciplined as well. "

As for Yeezus, it divided Kanye's fan base but it didn't divide professional critics.

Personally, I think Yeezus is one of Kanye's best albums and it managed to top My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (which won Best Rap album but wasn't even nominated for Album of the Year) and that's one of the best albums I have heard in the past fifteen years.

Still, I would make the argument simple to start with. 'So lesbians [or gay men, if you want to flip it around] should be forced to use the male showers too, right? Since they could make girls uncomfortable for the same reasons?' 

Assuming this person is not homophobic (if they do agree, though, ask them what they should do for bisexuals), they will likely disagree. From there, you can point out that anybody (lesbian, straight, gay, trans, cis, bi or whatever) who behaves innappropriately in a shower or bathroom will face consequences so why should trans people not be given the benefit of the doubt first, like the rest of us are?

*However,* that does not mean we forget this shambles. There are a lot of theories going around about how we play when we come up against a team determined to keep the ball, but the truth is the same: I don't think we've managed it once. 

It's hurt us against the bigger sides, and gave us problems against Swansea and Southampton as well. Our ""holding midfielders"" tend to become complacent and content with moving the ball on, and without Wilshere and Ramsey who have the confidence and acceleration to burst past their markers we become static in the middle. 

We also need to sort out our wing play, as without Walcott/Podolski, we've got no midfielders with a natural inclination to run into space. Given the hellish runs coming up over the next few weeks sorting out these problems need to be sorted as soon as possible.

it's almost impossible to make a bad chopped salad in my experience.  i love them, i eat them all the time, it's a great way to use up vegetables and only takes one tupperware (yay!).  these are some of my favorites, but there are seriously unlimited options- whatever you like can go into one.  i personally like making it the night before and letting it kind of sog together in the fridge by lunch the next day.  if you're a meat eater (i'm more of a pescatarian) you can add baked/ grilled chicken, steak, pork, whatever- just try to make veggies the bulk of it and use a lighter dressing.  [this](http://www.meijer.com/assets/product_images/styles/xlarge/1001029_041335000617_A_400.jpg) is one of my favorites, although it's super super high in sodium.  i usually mix it with lemon juice or balsamic to balance it out a little.  good luck!  chopped salads are the best!

Could you elaborate on this? If I heard you correctly the media team and the players (whom I assume are not part of the media team) were all living in the same house, yes? I don't understand how their goals could be confused. Wasn't it clear that the players were supposed to practice and that the media team was supposed to, for a lack of better words, ""do media""?

New accounts being unable to participate has certainly been something that the seniority santas have been demanding because it was so frustrating on both ends. Either you were buying for a new account with NO ACTIVITY and thus nothing to go on (I personally ran into this), or you were paired with someone new who had no intention of buying a gift. If it's the latter situation, you're not even aware of who you're paired with unless they reveal themselves, so most of these people getting shafted were *very likely* shafted by newbies to the exchange as well.

They implemented the PLUS exchanges and the ELVES subscription as a means to appease the senior santas without driving away possibly new redditors who wanted to hop right into the exchanges.

I personally agree that people who haven't been redditors for at least a year shouldn't be able to sign up at all. This ensures that you've been around long enough to understand the Reddit community/website and the work that goes into the exchanges.

Starshield101,AskReddit,1390946240.0,"All good mate, happy to help.

This technique I will explain to you isnt the ""golden key"" or anything its just something that helped me regain a bit of control. 

I will use an example that I remember a few years ago when my anxiety was at its worst. I once was at a turning lane it went to a green arrow I went to take off but I stalled my car and had to take off again as I did I ended up going through a red arrow, well that was it wasn't it. My thoughts went to anxiety mode, was there a cop? was there a traffic camera? did someone report me? I can't afford a fine! I wont be able to pay my bill I will lose power what am I going to do etc etc... I have a feeling you may relate to that thought pattern. 

What you need to do when you fall into this anxiety trap is to take control and find a positive to all your negatives. Was there a cop? no he would have pulled me over immediatly, Was there a traffic camera? no I know that intersection very well I dont know why I am worrying about this, did someone report me? no people are focused on driving and probably don't care. Now you will feel slightly better so now, make a point of remembering those feelings and the positive answers. As soon as any self doubt and negative feelings start taking over again go straight back to the postive conclusion you made and focus on that again and again and again. 

Its alot of work but its basically removing a bad habit of jumping to negative thoughts and teaching your mind to think of things that calm you down in bad situations instead of making you feel worse. Its called positive reinforcement. 

This helped me heaps and it finally gave me back some control when I was really depressed. 

I hope this makes sense and helps you"

I'm like you, and I spend WAY too much on things, mostly makeup, but I'm just a big spender. I'm materialistic. I like stuff. And I'm like you, I want EVERY option possible of a product that I love. I have a gazillion Buxom glosses to prove my point (and most of them look pretty much the same on my lips).

This year I want to spend less too. On everything. I can't afford my habits, and when I look at my makeup, I have a huge sense of pride and awe, but it also depresses me because I know I could have put that money to better use. I'm currently almost out of gas, and won't have money for a week and a half. I put myself into these situations, but I don't know how to get out of them. I'm 27 and this shit HAS. TO. STOP. I can't keep going like this, or I'll never be responsible enough to have the family, house and life I want for myself.

As someone who is like you, I'm super proud of you for only buying that one thing. Your friend seems really unsupportive, and especially since she knows your habits on buying makeup, she should really stop making you feel bad for being frugal for once. Maybe don't go makeup shopping with her, lest she shame you into buying something that's gonna make you eat Ramen the rest of the week. You'll go home regretting that purchase.

Stay strong! Don't buy stuff! Ignore your friend. Good luck with your cut back. If you find any magical solutions that suddenly kill your desire to buy anything unnecessary, please let me know. :)"

Have you learned nothing from Iraq? Afghanistan? Veitnam? Or the fact that we're not the world's police?

What was that? You don't understand the first thing about how the world works, nor the massive implications of what you're suggesting, which very much resembles the first steps of the sort of global world order that is not only a bad idea but is the very thing your comment history claims not only already exists but claims is responsible for all the world's problems?

After all, if we invade ethiopia for mistreating their citizens, what about russia? Or china? Or Korea? Or the UK? Or Greece? Or (gasp) us?"

3DGrunge,battlefield_4,1390946647.0,"&gt;No. I am actually a pretty good pilot. With my usual gunner in bf3 at least. Not so in bf4 because you can not stay alive longer than a minute on some maps. They just took the fun out of it and made it frustrating.

Exactly my point.  You bad pilots are pissed you cant go without deaths now while raping the battlefield.  You have to use a strategy other than hover at a flag.

&gt;Good that this is a game where balance matters and we don't count on real life, where one dude could bring you down with a stinger sure. But lmg would not work ;)

Small arm fire has been known to bring down more than one helicopter.  And at close range, a chopper would be obliterated by an lmg not to mention other weapons that could easily incapacitate a helicopter if people flew them in real life they way they do in this game.

&gt;And it isn't one dude who usually shoots three stingers at you in less than 20 seconds. More like two or more. You can't really dodge them on most of the maps. And even if you do....

Completely untrue.  You might get one stinger off before the helicopter has gone out of range and or killed you.  And that first stinger will not do anything.  If you are lucky enough to get a second stinger it does nothing to the chopper who simply repairs itself to full health.

&gt;The MAA will kill you while you try to get away from them. AA is way to overpowered and a good pilot/gunner crew should dominate the lonewulfs. Because you need a lot of skill for flying and even more communication.

MAA is easy to take out with a chopper.  It is better against ground soldiers than air.  And yes a chopper should dominate ground soldiers that are do not have anti air weaponry.  And it should do so from distance not hovering around at a flag as it does now before zipping away repairing itself.

&gt;Stinger is a fire and forget/no skill needed weapon which with all the other AA in the game broke the fun in flying. Christ. Have you ever played Bf2? Talk about shifting from skill to no skill weapon systems..

I have played bf2.  There is a reason people banned helicopters in that game.  At least the good servers did.

YOu basically are saying you want the helicopter to be a flying death machine with no fear of being taken out.  You are the pathetic scum that are destroying modern games.  Seriously you need ot learn to fly if you think the helicopters are weak in bf4."

Wall Street is a completely different game than the one Apple is playing. Frankly, I see Wall Street now as being an emotional entity that speculates far too much and thus has lost credibility. It's much easier to play one's hand these days as a result and play Wall Street at it's own game than before. It can take just one analyst's article to cause a ripple in stock value.

Apple isn't playing Wall Street, thus it's not fairing well there. If they wanted to though, they could really turn things around. But Wall Street isn't their target market. I applaud their ethic. They are becoming a staple brand in societies everywhere. They may not see sensational growth again, but there will be no removal of them as a brand for a long time coming. Their growth will continue to be steady by it's own accord. That's how Apple has mostly been. I'll take stability over volatility any day. It's a shift. That's all that's happening here.

Everything that came out yesterday was growth. Rumors, speculation, analyst's reports and expectations are what Wall Street is paying attention to rather than reality. Short time players are on the run. Goodbye.

TL;DR: Wall Street, you're drunk. Go home."

I’m only pointing this out, because the article **wants** us to be outraged that 4 vials = $89,000, but the truth is at least a little bit more complicated than that.

TL;DR: The visit’s costs were comprised of things other than 4 vials of antivenom.  Yes, I agree that $89,000 seems way too high.  I’m not an expert, but I don’t see any reason why the bill should have been more than $5,000 total."

Mobility disable barely hinders flight with a decent pilot.  Yes bad pilots end up crashing.  But that mobility hit is the ONLY thing taking them down right now.

I am not a good pilot and never claimed to be a good pilot.  Just because I am not a good pilot does not make my statements any less true.  You however are also a terrible pilot and want god mode to cover for it.

I am fine with them teh way they are.  Hell I want them weaker but with longer range weapons and more mobility.  They are way to slow and clunky for me.

agentup,rage,1390947526.0,"I don't disagree with what you said, and I actually have respect for what Paris Hilton has accomplished. However, she has access to a world a normal person would not have.

Paris Hilton when she was just starting out had a vast network of her families soft resources. Those being friends, associates, contacts. etc. Those undoubtedly helped her get started.

Again not dismissing her accomplishments, but her name and family have definitely benefited her success. 

And the problem therein lies in the definition of worked. I could work and be 50x smarter and better looking than Paris Hilton but without doors opening for me I'd never accomplish what she has.

Just as an example. Let's say I have an idea for pen that never runs out of ink and Paris Hilton from 1998 has the same idea. She can go to her family's lawyer and say ""hey put me in touch with someone I can sell this idea to"" and me, I'd have no idea where to start and if I did find someone they would be skeptical and less inclined to take a risk on me than Paris. Meaning the contract I get would probably be for far less value. Meaning I'd have to come up with multiple good ideas to keep going and making money."

Anime is very diverse. It is a medium, after all, not a genre. From action to romance to comedy. If you find yourself not enjoying a bunch of similar anime, look for a different genre.

Of course, another great thing about anime is that there are shows that contain aspects of multiple genres. For example, one show that I think is great (and that I would definitely recommend) is **[Hataraku Maō-sama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!)**. Hataraku is a comedy series, essentially, but it has a good bit of fun action and fantasy elements as well.

Xinasha,truegaming,1390947548.0,"Well, some may argue that it's an easy way out, but personally I feel that it depends on the game. Games like McPixel, for example, who attribute their novelty in part to their simplicity, would become convoluted with ""real"" graphics.

As someone on the team of SanctuaryRPG (/r/SanctuaryRPG), a retro-stylized text-based game, I can say that if you are trying to emulate a ""retro"" or older game, pixel/""retro"" graphics is your main choice. For us, our game is build 100% in ASCII art and text, simply to keep the graphics feeling ""retro"" yet still unique and playable. If we wanted to make them McPixel-esque, we probably could have. If we wanted to make them Crysis 3-esque, we probably could have. But it wouldn't have the same impact. So I guess the answer is: it depends.

BillieBee,raisedbynarcissists,1390947659.0,"After an argument concerning how I was planning my wedding, we went NC. A little while later, I start getting panicked phone calls from relatives who had been informed by one or both of my parents that the wedding would probably not be proceeding. In fact, my husband and I continued planning and paying for the wedding we wanted. So there!

I did invite my parents to the wedding, because I wanted to be the mature one in this relationship. I entered the church from the side, so I did not immediately see the attendees. I had no idea if they were there or not. My maid-of-honor cousin snuck out of the preparation area and found them seated in the back row, my mom sobbing. Again, because I was trying to be level-headed (and was already loaded up with Xanax), I had cousin invite mom in to the prep room so I could give her a corsage. She came back, weeping, and when I offered her the flowers, she declined. She said I apparently didn't think she was a good enough mother to receive one. Fine, give it to my elderly great-aunt and get mom out of here now.

Of course, dad wasn't going to walk me down the aisle, nor did I want the implication that my father could ""give"" me to my husband.  Instead, my soon-to-be husband came down the aisle to meet me halfway, because that's how we believe marriage works.  They must have left before the ceremony was even over because I didn't see them when we walked out.

They were no shows at the reception as well, having previously scolded me for picking a place in our small city which had a gorgeous ballroom.  Spent the whole night evading questions about why they weren't there, but it was better than the alternative of having the whole thing blow up into a huge scene.

Then, as my mom's parents are leaving, they hand me their gift and demand that I open it right away.  It was a cookbook entitled "" Help! Where's Mom Now That I Need Her!"" Because the night wouldn't have been complete without at least one passive-aggressive act.

All in all, I think I actually lucked out because they stayed away for the most part. To this day, I think they were waiting for me to beg them to come and participate. Another bonus is that I dint have to see them in any of my wedding photos!"

After Challenger the flight suits were made a lot better going from simple flight suits with helmets to pressurized suits with oxygen supply and various survival gear including parachutes and rafts. They may have been able to survive if those existed then and they managed to open a hatch and bail out. 

Well, the explosion wasn't really an explosion. All the fuel in the main tank went up in flames at the same time, but the SRBs flew off on their own basically unharmed, and the orbiter broke up due to the force of hitting air at almost Mach 2 while being thrown into a bad angle of attack more than the actual explosion. The crew compartment only hit between 12-20 g's for a second or two, quickly dropped to 4 g's and was basically down to zero within 10 seconds. That's certainly survivable without more than minor injuries and pilots with g force training especially can maintain consciousness in that.

If you support Reanimator, Show and Tell, and Survival of the Fittest packages (enablers and huge-ass creatures) then it will do well. As /u/Simple_Man said, Red doesn't get a whole lot of fun tricks to play around with in cube. The decks that red gets put into are usually for simple aggro or burn cards, so something wonky and build-around like Sneak Attack makes the color a bit deeper / more interesting.

3DGrunge,battlefield_4,1390947895.0,"&gt;Put up your battlelog then kiddo let's see just how good of a pilot you are.

I am not a good pilot.  I know and play with/against good pilots all the time.  I never claimed to be a good pilot.  However unlike the other bad pilots here I do not want god mode.

&gt;It's generally a bad player dog whistle when you hear someone say the only way to destroy a helicopter is with a 'lucky' RPG or tank round.

Or an honest person that is constantly playing with and against good pilots.  I would love to see them have more range and more mobility but they need to be much weaker than they are.

&gt;Considering it's never been easier in this franchise to crush helicopters, missile speed is 3.5 FASTER then it was in BF3

Hoenstly it was easier in bf2.  And making them easier to kill is a good thing not a bad thing.  However the helicopters mobility and range are the broken issue with them.  Not their ability to take hits.

&gt; if you think it's 'luck' to hit a chopper with a an RPG or tank shell you are most likely very bad.

It is luck to hit a helicopter with an rpg.  Or a very very very very bad helicopter pilot.  I find it pretty easy to take down helicopters with a tank round but that's me not everyone else.  As I am called a hacker by many when I do it.

&gt; I'm going to take a wild guess and say you're just another bad lock-on scrub terrified of skilled players in vehicles you can't use yourself, so you complain about helicopters being 'over powered' when 95% of the player base is telling you they are not, when they clearly aren't.

The noisy few that want stronger helicopters want god mode.  I am assuming you are a casual douche who is sad that he can't go 50 and 0 with a helicopter anymore.  I can guarantee you that 95% of the player base want weaker helicopters.  The noisy 1% that want stronger helicopters are terrible players who want god mode when they already have something extremely close to it if they didn't suck at flying.  Look right now helicopters easily erase everything else on the battlefield if you can fly. 

The game is battlefield not battlecopter."

I grab my trainer and she starts looking at him and then starts laughing her ass off.

Not everyone with a weight problem is *guilty* of overeating, and you can't just *tell* that by looking. Some people have huge tumors. Other people struggle with metabolic conditions. Still others are on medications that cause weight gain. 

Further, not one bloody person will ever tell you that you need to have exactly three cigarettes of precisely 2-2.5 inches long every day to solve your smoking problem. 

Fact of the matter is, if you're stuck on a flight next to a fat person, and you are legitimately uncomfortable, you're the one responsible for asking to move. Further *you* are the one who should be informing the airline of your condition and asking not to be seated next to someone robust. 

But maybe, just maybe, the *airlines* are to blame here, for not making a larger effort to accommodate *all* their customers.

cfedey,MonsterHunter,1390948180.0,"So, with phials, it works like this:

Power phials give your raw damage formula (there's raw and elemental components to most weapons) a 25% boost while in Sword mode. That's not to say it boosts your damage by 25%, but it adds a 1.25 coefficient to the raw formula.

Elemental phials do the same thing as Power phials, except they boost the elemental and status damage by 25%. Elemental damage is Dragon, Fire, Water, Thunder, and Ice. This damage is applied every hit and is calculated separately from raw damage, but added to it to determine total damage. Status damage (Poison, Sleep, Paralysis and Slime) is simply 10% of the displayed number, but it doesn't apply 100% of the time.

Paralysis, Dragon, and Poison phials add that element/status while in Sword mode, and also have that element/status as a latent ability in the weapon. You'll need the Free Element skill to have the element/status working while not in Sword mode.

Exhaust phials are special, in that they drain the monster's stamina with some attacks, making them tire out faster. They also allow you to KO monsters if you hit them in the head enough, just like you could with an Impact weapon. These weapons never have a latent element/status.

I hope that wasn't too confusing. If you want me to clarify anything, just ask.

Also, [here's](http://kiranico.com/weapon/switchaxe/) the weapon tree for Switch Axe. Personally I have one for every element and status, but you can just focus on a good all-around weapon for now if you want, until you get more familiar with the game."

Are you really *that* insecure?

I wore only a t-shirt all year long for a while, not because I wanted to impress anyone, but because I wasn't cold. When I wore a jacket, hell, even a hoodie I started sweating immediatly and looked like I ran a damn marathon when I arrived in school. At -10°C/14°F it got chilly enough for me to wear something with long sleeves. I've been to a doctor, checking up if everything was alright with me, getting some blood tests done, as well as ultrasound checkup, but nothing came up. They assume my body is just pretty good at converting energy to heat.

And yet at least once a week some dumbass would come by and tell me about how I need to wear more clothes, or how I'm retarded for going out only in a t-shirt, or that I'm not impressing anyone or whatever else they had to tell me.

Fuck me for having a body that is less prone to feeling cold than you are, right? Because heaven forbid someone does something differently from everyone else."

TheWorldIsAhead,AskReddit,1390948352.0,"Driving when you are terrible at driving. 

The roads are public. The fatalities are far too many. The money and time wasted because people can't do it right is too damn high. I see too many people who simply can't drive. They don't have the reflexes, the coordination or the understanding of traffic. And so they shouldn't be driving. 

But for some reason we see operating a 1-2 ton piece of heavy machinery as a human right so even if you have diminished mental capabilities somehow you WILL have that license. Recently shocking studies came out about how old people cling to their license long after they are unfit to drive (I think it was conducted in Denmark). I get it. Not being able to drive is a handicap. People will do it even if they shouldn't. 

Doesn’t mean it isn't wrong. 

Also: Knowing how to drive well, and choosing to drive like an idiot putting everyone in danger. "

FeatherDie,AskWomen,1390949010.0,"The most important thing is realizing that unless your child is asexual, even if he or she abstains from sex now, that they are a sexually mature young adult and will have sex at some point. I would say that even asexual individuals experiment with their sexuality because they just are not sure whether they want sex or not at first.

You are not dealing with someone who can turn on or turn off their desires, feelings, or thoughts. You have to deal with that person as a person. They aren't a miniature you anymore (sadface), but they are capable of being a sexually mature, independent, and wonderful adult. A parent should guide them and help them through this stage in life in whatever way works for them. Anyone who does otherwise is just hurting that individual, their child.

Personally, I can only offer my own experiences. That young men are just as confused as young women until they have experience with dating/sex/relationships, and that they are both at risk for long term consequences if they don't protect themselves (STDs, emotional turmoil, pregnancy, etc). I would teach my children to respect all other people, and to know it's okay to make their own decision.

I will probably also recommend that my daughter start using some form of birth control (or at least have access) once she reaches puberty and wants to start dating.

shafonfa,AskWomen,1390949029.0,"My husband is an excellent father, and I think the main reason is that he is able to set aside his own desires for the benefit of me and the baby. I had postpartum depression for the first 2 months, and he was incredibly supportive... Cooking, changing diapers, and getting me out of the house to cheer me up. He was so encouraging and loving, and it really helped to have his support during that hard time.

Now that I'm feeling better, he's still very helpful and involved with the baby. He loves her, and its so obvious. He's always pointing out the cute things she does and is willing to change diapers, give her a bottle, or cook dinner... Whatever needs to be done. 

I make sure he has some time here and there to relax and play a video game or something, but in return he doesn't expect to play for hours on end like he used to before we had a baby. He understands that right now, the baby is very needy, and neither of us will have much downtime. He's okay with that.

He had been on morphine and hospice care for a while, so my son understood that he had been very sick. When we told our son, we just simply told him that uncle Joey was very sick and had died. He somewhat understood and we had to tell him that unfortunately we weren't going to be able to see uncle Joey anymore. He would often repeat to us ""...uncle Joey is dead, right mom?"" and at first, it was a hard question for me to deal with because he asked it like it was an everyday question.

If you are so amazing with copters you should welcome making them faster and deadlier from range while making them weaker as less bad pilots will be flying.

Certainly the idea of logical interrogation of our existence is immensely important and has helped give rise to our modern world.  But its not really a one or the other proposition as you frame it. The scientific method was not designed to answer philosophical questions.    These questions, such as ""Why do we exist?""can only be answered by the individual.  Since we're dealing with such a personal and ephemeral questions, whether or not something can be empirical shown to exist by our limited understanding of the physical universe is not as important as whether the answer is personally satisfying, and motivates the individual to work hard, to preserver in the face of hardship, or to do good for others.

As for OP's question, um, it's possible? There's not the slightest hint of evidence to suggest that they are though.

FuckESPN,RotMG,1390949454.0,"&gt; Installing a keylogger on a computer - Keyloggers are malicious software that records what you type and sends it to the owner of the keylogger. Some hacked clients are bundled with hidden keyloggers.

Look, I didn't downvote you, but this (among other things) just shows a lot of ignorance when it comes to what you know about RotMG hacking. No one uses a true 'keylogger' in this game. It'd scrape far, far more information than what they'd ever want. All of the malicious files we've seen for months now simply scrape the RotMG.sol file for your login/password, and maybe search your PC for the MuleDump accounts.js file.

Seriously, have not seen one single tried and true keylogger released for this game. And claiming they're the #1 threat is ignorant as shit. There are some super cool ways to protect your stuff in this game. For instance - only keep your MD on a thumb drive. None of the currently released/popular ""loggers"" for Realm search beyond your regular main storage HDD. So if you keep your MD safe, even if you somehow fuck up and a ""friend"" sends you a malicious file that you accept thinking ""hey, I know this guy, its cool"" - you're still safe.

Or, y'know, just keep making stupid claims that don't really protect people but get you upvotes. Thats cool too!

&gt; Always make sure that you have an updated antivirus program such as Comodo, Spybot, or Malwarebytes. One scan could save your account from being hacked.

Why? **Not a single one** of these will protect you from **any** of the RotMG credential stealing programs. Why on earth is everyone so quick to put their account security into someone elses hands? None of these programs give a damn about your RotMG credentials - don't trust them to.

&gt; Don't use RWT sites - especially if they ask for your login information.

There is only one site that requests their user's info, and that site has been around longer (and, among its customer base is more reputable than) Kabam themselves. This is just silly fear mongering and ignorance.

&gt; Try to always copy and paste your login information instead of typing it. Most keyloggers only record keystrokes, not copied information, so if you copy your login information from a .txt document, the keylogger most likely won't see that you've entered something, besides seeing that you pressed Ctrl + C/V.

Again, ignorance of how ""hacking"" in RotMG is done. This will not save you, as the data will still update in your local RotMG.sol file as soon as you log in.

&gt; Of course, they use this information to hack your account instead.

Ignorant. Fear. Mongering. There are plenty of negative things you can say about RWT sites - but this is just some out of left field stuff. If RWT were doing this in any sort of large portion you'd see thousands of players on the forums complaining about it."

On an AR the barrel is inline with the comb, so your eye is much higher over the mounting surface of the gun.  So you must run taller rings to get the scope to the proper eye level.  I can run low to medium rings on all my bolt gun scopes, same scopes on an AR require high to extra high.

Unfortunately, simply pointing this out to white people in power is going to be largely ineffective in bring about positive change, so general rules have to be put in place to keep privilege in check, at least somewhat. Diversity standards (like Affirmative Action, which very few of its critics seem to understand), are one way to battle institutionalized racial bias. The thing is, though, it's a step in the right direction, not a destination. The destination, frankly, is to abandon the unbelievably arbitrary concept of race entirely so people stop using it as a way to think of themselves as better than some other group. "

Banner_Free,fatpeoplestories,1390949940.0,"/r/keto has useful information, but here's the short version:

Weight loss requires a calorie deficit (i.e. eating fewer calories than you expend). Keto is a ""trick"" to maintain that calorie deficit; the foods you'll eat on a ketogenic diet are very filling, so it's easy to maintain a calorie deficit.

Subjectively, it also feels less restrictive than a lot of diets - you can eat fried meat covered in melted cheese - so it's easier to stick with it for longer and have fewer relapses.

In the end, though, you can't escape physics, and it always boils down to calories in vs calories out. Trying to lose the ""last ten pounds"" on keto was very, very difficult for me."

weaselbeef,pics,1390950029.0," crab bucket is what it is: crabs in a bucket. However, what happens in the bucket full of crabs is what makes it a famous saying. 

When a single crab is put into a lidless bucket, they surely can and will escape. However, when more than one share a bucket, none can get out. If one crab elevates themself above all, the others will grab this crab and drag'em back down to share the mutual fate of the rest of the group. 

Crab bucket syndrome is often used to describe social situations where one person is trying to better themself and others in the community attempt to pull them back down. Also often used in describing the ghettos of America (or anywhere, for that matter)."

winged_venus,TwoXChromosomes,1390950119.0,"Money is one of the things couples fight most about, and lack of it puts incredible stress on a marriage.  You're understandbly stressed, but don't be mad at your husband for his pride; the DEFINITION of a man's success in our society is being able to provide for his family.  Taking a pride hit on this is HUGE.  He feels how he feels, and you're going to have to 'get' it, just as you feel how you feel about your health and get that.

The two of you need to sit down and talk realistically about money.  If you haven't drawn up a budget (even a meager one) do so.  If you're not cutting coupons, do it.  If you don't know what healthy combinations and frugal foods are, find out.  

Basically, what has hit him right now, is that he's not 'man enough'.  He's not good enough to provide, not a success.  In other words, when a mother in law has to help, a man is a failure.  (that's our society, not my definition.)  So be understanding that he has a reason for feeling the way he does, just as you do. No, you do not have a right to be angry at him for his feelings!!   Anymore than he should be angry at you for yours.  His feelings are NOT less valid than yours.

If she wants a bus ticket, and you want to help, maybe buy the bus ticket to somewhere safe, but not where you are.

Most likely the website needs a certain port open on the router (your schools IT folks can probably tell you how to fix this), or, if your router has one, it's an issue with the built in firewall (again, see your schools IT folks for this).

FewRevelations,bisexual,1390950531.0,"you might find /r/polyamory more helpful here

Basically as far as having an ""open"" relationship or multiple partners: it all comes down to what you guys are comfortable with. You're okay with her having sex with other people but not relationships? Tell her. You only want her having sex with other women? Tell her. You guys need to talk about exactly what is and isn't okay. Set boundaries, but be prepared to change those boundaries -- AFTER talking about them -- if you find that's needed. Most important is that you two are always open and honest about how you're feeling about all of this. If you get jealous, *tell her.* It won't just go away on its own.

As far as the religious/moral aspect: even the Pope doesn't always hear directly from God. In every sect of the Church there are people who think differently from one another. I bet you could find plenty of gay-friendly and poly-friendly Lutherans, if you knew where to look.

Yes, I did this the entire game in both Oblivion and Skyrim. If you wait and fast travel long enough (both not cheating) they will get more cash. I don't even want to think about how long it took to do all that.  

Probably days. Perhaps weeks. I rocked about 1,000 hours in each one, so it's likely.

winged_venus,TwoXChromosomes,1390951104.0,"Wow, so sorry for this for you.  Unfortunately, when we put ourselves in doctor's hands, they sometimes have to make immediate and emergency decisions.  Surgery is not often indicated in a partially detached placenta unless there is no other way to stop the bleeding.  In that case, it takes time to get you to surgery, scrape and cauterize your uterus.  So what the doctor did wasn't 'wrong' it was the necessary action to save your life from bleeding out, and an emergency.  You would be dead otherwise.

The two events are not related.  One was a violation and one was a life-saving immediate action.  But since they felt similar to you, it felt horrible.  I would suggest counseling to help.  

maybe it will help to know your baby's head is bigger than the doctor's hand?  Getting their hands up there is not unusual for birth; breech births need to be turned, etc.  Childbirth is invasive, degrading if you're not prepared for it.  You are cut, split, exposed, everyone's hands everywhere, wrist deep, you shit yourself in front of people and sometimes vomit, and it is truly painful.  Definitely get counseling to help you over the rape trauma that was triggered again with the birth, before you would decide to have another child.  You might also want to consider an at-home birth with a midwife, but they may not advise it if you've had problem births before.  

Just understand the medical action was not a violation, though it felt like one, and it felt like one because of being assaulted. You need healing, and I hope you find it."

Dabookitty,MultipleSclerosis,1390951162.0,"Feel isolated around others who just don't get what we deal with...yes, very often.  I am lucky that I have a very supportive wife and my family and inlaws are all there for me.  My mom is very good at pushing me just a little bit so I don't stop trying to do something because of MS.

I have not disclosed to my co-workers at new office yet...but I fear what I starting to feel is another relapse, so really I won't be able to keep it secret for much longer.

I feel isolated when I am out in public though and you get the stares from people.  It's just not normal for a 33 year old man to walk with a cane(and I hate using the cane, I'd rather waddle like a penguin then use the cane).  Or when I sit in the seats specifically for the those with mobility issues on the bus/train.  People give me the dirtiest looks when I don't move for some woman with a stoller.  People just make assumptiong and judge you.

The wake up call was when I was walking downtown and a police officer started talking to me because he thought I was publicly intoxicated because of how I was walking.  I didn't think it was that bad.

The emotional rollercoster that comes with this disease is no fun for anyone at all.  Other little things that become harder to do...for example I can't go shopping by myself for bric-a-brac or anything fragile that I would have to pick up with my hands.  My grip sometimes is just not there, I've spent a small fortune on getting my wifes Crystal repaired from when I have been cleaning.

I admit sometimes I just cry...it is at times just so devistating during a relapse at the deterioration of my body.  If not for my wife I would have suceeded in ending it all a few years ago.  Reach out to those around you, you might not have an SO but you must have friends near by.  Reach out to your community.  Maybe look into joining a local MS Society Chapter.  

Don't be afraid to ask for help, even for the little things.  Pride will get you no where."

Alternately, since you have work that needs to be handed in tonight, connect using tethering or the mobile hotspot feature on your phone (if it has one), get your shit done, then settle in for the 2+ hours it will probably take for your ISP to get to the bottom of this.

MR502,fresno,1390951186.0,"When I was without a car, and bike was stolen I was relegated to taking the bus. Because the whole relying on people for a ride gets old fast (even if you offer to pay gas.) 

I found the stops lacking a covering and some without a bench to sit, the signs have no information displaying arrival and departure times. Just a route number and map (provided it's not tagged up). 
Which is pointless because if you don't have a FAX book on routes or times, or a phone you don't know if your late or early. 

It wasn't the overcrowding that bothered me, it was the random times the drivers would be taking breaks and lunches. I can't tell you how many times I was late for work because of that. 

Now I'm all for a better and improved bus system, but before the Fresno goes and throws away money. The current system needs to be fixed and improved.

(see the thing in the FAQ for a link to locations of all the chests, get them all). Spend your first 1k timeless coins on glider so you can get the free burden of eternity.

When you are done with this and as many of the quests as you can do, you should have in the range of 10k coins. Buy 10 mogu runes of fate then run ToT heroic, use mogu runes on every boss with a weapon, do it more than once until you get a weapon. Coincidentally, if you can hit 496 (or whatever limit is for LFR SoO, run that and use your Warforged Seal rolls on the end boss of each wing (they are the ones that drop weapons)

I highly recommend using your Burden of Eternity on ring, as you will take a while replacing it. If you get a 2nd burden, use it on anything that isn't: Head, Chest, Legs, Shoulders, Gloves. You will want tier pieces for these, and you dont' want to be choosing between a 535 piece and a 528 piece of tier.

**Forumla D**  Great fun, good interaction, we get plenty of laughs out of this, watching someone crash and burn, picking the wrong gear, or taking too big a risk.  Would suggest no less than 4 player, it will work, but no where near as much interaction or congestion.

**Tsuro** Great filler, can be quite interactive, as you steer others off the board, or trap them in a corner.  Good to play will waiting for other to arrive. Anywhere from 2 to 8 player works great.  I wouldn't bother with the ""Of the seas"" version

**Robo Rally** Fun, interactive, some planning and stragergy, attacking others, probably want atleast 3 or 4, the more the better.  Can make the game long or short, depending how many flags you put out, can play 2 flags and be done within an hour, or make a larger map up and have some fun.  Can also play CTF or team game variants for extra fun.

**Citadels** As others have said, as long as people don't take ages to choose roles, can be great fun, though can drag a bit, and get frustrating if you keep getting robbed or assassinated randomly.


*Edit* to add, there is some chance you guys would enjoy **Cards against Humanity**, might be worth looking into, based on the lighter bang and munckin that you play, might suit the group for some fun times and laughs."

crowshow,AskReddit,1390951556.0,"Well let me tell you!

They continued to bill me for a month after I'd disconnected, cancelled, and returned all their equipment. I never got the bills (I moved, hence the cancellation) and they sent me to collections. They said everything was fixed, but it turned out they didn't do anything and I got sent to a different collections agency. Wasted 2 days getting that squared away.

My coworker recently moved and cancelled their service. TW asked for the router/modem back, but my coworker had purchased her own and had been using it for years. Turns out they were getting charged $6/mo for ""renting"" equipment that they owned. But of course, they didn't save the receipt for their router/modem (bought it ~6 years ago) so TW forced them to hand over the equipment as there was no record that it WASN'T time warner's.

ETA: They also have a habit of adding fees onto your bill, knowing that most people have automatic bill payment, so you have to check your bill every month and usually have to call them and argue the bogus charges. And, they usually start you off with a ""new customer"" price and then raise the price after a couple months. Our first bill was $20 more than we'd been told, and when we called and asked they told us that it was an installation fee of $60 being spread out over 3 months. This was after choosing TW over ATT specifically because they had no installation fee. Uh, sorry, NO. 

I could go on for hours about how much TW sucks and how their business model is modern highway robbery. God I hope their company fails and they all become destitute."

ConstipatedNinja,pics,1390951664.0,"The BBB has admitted to some wrongdoing in the past. For example, you start a business, and it gets indexed in the BBB. If you pay membership fees, before any reviews whatsoever you will have an A or A+ rating. If you do not, before any reviews whatsoever you will have between a C and an F. If you do not pay fees, you cannot respond to any negative reviews. If you get any negative reviews that aren't responded to, you get an F. Which means that if you don't join, you're going to end up with an F rating. The Ritz Carlton is an example of one such company.

Furthermore, if you stop paying dues, you might be subject to a drop in rating. Many companies in the Canadian BBB went from A to D from not paying the membership fee anymore. No new complaints, just the fee.

And then there are problems where each branch isn't necessarily as ethical as another. The Austin chapter, for example, refused to resolve complaints against companies unless they were paid a $70 mediation fee from the complaining customer. There's dozens of such chapters that have hit the news with similar stories of obvious shenanigans. Even a quick search on your favorite news site of the BBB will garner a nice collection of articles."

To address your points:

*  The author discusses some of Bell's theories, but does *not* discuss Bell's Theorem; Bell's Theorem is relevant to this discussion, but only proves that a simple probabilistic interpretation of QM cannot be valid. It does not say anything about other interpretations such as Everett's or the Copenhagen interpretation.

* As for Everett's theorem, ""incredibly influential"" is a vague term; ""incredibly influential"" among whom? I would agree that it is not ""incredibly influential"" in the general population, or even amongst most researchers investigating quantum phenomena, mainly because for the most part physicists accept the math and don't think about what waveforms mean or are. However, Everett's many-worlds interpretation is ""incredibly influential"" among those who study quantum foundations; I think the author is correct to place it next to the Copenhagen interpretation in terms of importance, and then to discuss the two of them."

Women are taught to avoid rape because it's easier to control victims than it is to control perpetrators. Do I think rape is ever a victim's fault? No. Will I tell my future kids to never leave their drinks uncovered, and to always be with a buddy? Fuck yes. "

&gt; Let me start with this, for quite a while my husband has been spending less time at home and more time out ""at work."" It's always been an issue that I have to negotiate with him on this. 

If it's been too big a hassle with you to get what he needs in the way of socialization with other people in order to have a happy and fulfilling life, maybe its easier to just not tell the truth and not have a big fight over so simple a thing as wanting to socialize with other people.

Be honest, you say you try to 'distract yourself' whenever he'd go out with friends.  He's obviously a social guy with a lot of friends, and you're less sociable.  He has different social needs than you do.  Just asking, is there any way that you are making it too difficult for him to get what he needs in the way of socializing with other people to be happy, by wanting to or trying to restrict his socializing?

I'm sorry, really attempting to be civil here, but are you fucking serious? How, exactly, are you getting this from what I'm saying? My point is that, rather than focusing on the crimes perpetrated by other nations it is understandable and acceptable that we attempt to learn from our own misdeeds. Think before you type, please, because this sarcastic comment makes absolutely no sense when viewed in the context of my larger point. 

&gt; So we don't want to repeat misdeeds and the best way to do that is to ignore a good chunk of them...

Whelp thank god they are so unlike us we can safely ignore them knowing we'll never be like them. /s

Again, nothing you're saying here makes sense. How, exactly, is what AMERICANS learn in AMERICA going to change VIETNAMESE culture?

I'm again not saying sweep the crimes of others under the rug, what I'm saying is that we should focus on learning what we did wrong in the past to attempt to prevent repeating those mistakes in the future.

Obama's policies are bad enough without being disingenuous to make them seem worse.

For example:

&gt; The Number Of People That Have Entered Poverty Since 2008: 6.7 Million.

Bad.  Bad, bad bad.  Obama took office in January **2009**.  People entering poverty in 2008 are not his fault or responsibility.  They used 2008 to make the number seem worse than it is.

To a lesser extent: 

&gt; The Number Of People Unemployed At The End Of Obama’s Fifth Year As President: 10.4 Million.

Great hard number here... existing in a vacuum.  What was the number of people unemployed on the day he took office?  There's no comparison for this number.

As for OP's question: I think that's pretty much EXACTLY what they're doing. The world's smartest boys club doing evil deeds to save the world. 

As for whether they're ""replacing"" the original Shield? I'd say that depends on the ultimate fate of Shield, something we won't know till issues 5 and 6 of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol. 2 are released later this year(hopefully). "

It flows so well. Listen how he pronounces *helmet*  and *velvet* also. And lyrics are interesting, to me at least. *Stankonia* is just experimental, not in a bad way but it's definitely more pop-ish than their older albums.

Also this wikiquote may further explain your question:

Willravel,PostCollapse,1390953799.0,"Laptop with replaceable batteries plus solar chargers would be worth their weight in seeds post-collapse, especially with repositories of useful information.

You could have books to help you with basically everything, from hunting and farming for food sources to mining, purifying, and shaping metal to building long-term shelters and even homes. Imagine having wikipedia access during the Middle Ages. 

Smart move would be to have a half dozen laptops with the batteries removed stashed away with extra batteries and extra empty hard drives (empty meaning with OSs, just not a lot of files and data). You use a laptop with replaceable batteries and a hard drive you have backed up externally and which has a removable hard drive. If something happens to your battery, swap it out for a new one.

Neebat,bestof,1390955298.0,"An old saying I heard from an economist, ""There are two kinds of regulation, inefficient and ineffective.""

I'd say that regulation IS inherently evil, but occasionally, maybe even rarely, it's better than the alternative.

There's a great example here in Austin, and I would have opposed it if I'd been following local politics when it happened:  Retail stores are forbidden from selling dogs and cats.

This is exactly the sort of government meddling that... except, it's working.  You can still get cats and dogs at the pet store.  The ban opened the door to rescue organizations to come in and offer in-store adoptions of neutered, vaccinated, healthy animals.  That's cut pressure on the shelters, so they're approaching 100% adoption rate for all healthy animals.  Austin is becoming a role-model for no-kill shelters.

It may stop some parents from impulse purchasing pets for spoiled children, but otherwise, it leaves everyone free to buy what they want.  Breeders can still advertise online and educated people with a preference for ""purebreed labradoodles"" can still find them.  It IS inefficient, because it slows down the process, but it turns out, the process of becoming a caretaker for a pet *should* be slow and deliberate.

Turns out, it's a great example of dealing well with the externalized expenses (over-population caused by puppy and kitten mills) without trying to destroy the market."

In either scenario, RWT sites hacking their own customers is pretty senseless. Too easy to ruin a site's reputation online nowadays.

Maybe you just typed this poorly - but to me this is you again indicating something is a keylogger/trojan that is well known it isn't. MD/.sol stealers are so fundamentally different from keyloggers that protecting against keyloggers to try to ward off a much more dangerous threat is borderline a waste of time (assuming your only goal is protecting your RotMG assets).

Additionally, in Conan Doyle's notes, he toyed with calling Sherlock ""Sherrinford"". So unofficially, the hypothetical older Holmes brother is sometimes called Sherrinford.

superspeck,woodworking,1390956089.0,"Heh. I'm a hobbyist renovator, but one who's interested in building science and who actually takes the time to read specifications, read code, read academic papers on building systems, and to actually study how the system is supposed to work, as opposed to slapping on something I saw on Houzz with the cheapest materials. 

I also took a class that my local fire department offered, called Citizens' Fire Academy. We had an entire four hour session on the flammability of common household materials that was really quite fascinating, and explained a lot of upcoming changes to the building code, specifically about requiring residential fire suppression systems (sprinklers) in new construction and just complying with existing code for smokes and windows in older structures. As part of that, the biggest group of pyros you've ever seen lit a bunch of common household stuff on fire. You'd be surprised what burns and what doesn't and how fast some things burn -- and I no longer have ANY Ikea furniture in my house. 

My main issues with structures are not the architect or builder's issues, which is why I brought them up. As someone who lives in and does work to structures, my issues are longevity and failure modes of the structure and ability to alter the structure in the future. These issues are largely not addressed by modern ""tight homes"" practices that are addressed in current trade magazines, and are really not addressed well in some styles of sealed unit construction that's been featured repeatedly in JLC in the past few years. 

Since the post-WWII era it's been acceptable to build spec homes to a thirty year lifespan. At that point, it's generally accepted that the house will need a major overhaul to extend it's lifetime another ten to thirty years. What the industry hasn't established is how that overhaul, as well as general modifications that are normal for a house's lifestyle, can or will happen with a structure that is air-sealed to the standards in the next few editions of the IECC. That gorgeous .5 ACH50 will be maintained right up until the first resident moves in and the first Time Warner installer visits, and then you've got a problem with a tightly sealed wall unit that Time Warner drilled straight through letting moisture condense in that little spot, which in some climates will lead to a big mold intrusion in the wall of Junior's bedroom. And it's not necessarily the Time Warner tech's fault, nor is it the homeowner's fault -- neither of them had the skills or expertise to evaluate what they were doing to the structural envelope. It's your fault, and the builder's fault, and it's my problem as I try to figure out how to cut out and remediate a section of rotten and moldy structure when I truly cannot remove the exterior sheathing or alter the framing without significantly and irreversibly altering structure. 

The failure mode for a house with a minor termite problem in a joist or two a little bit of creaking as the joists settle, and then some noticeable structural subsidence before eventual failure. The failure mode for a house with engineered I-beams that catches a bit of the munchies is a sudden crunch and a collapse. [And that's not even talking about fire issues.](http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/fire/reports/face200707.html) 

The way the construction industry is set up, you don't spend that much time thinking about it, and you don't spend that much time working around those issues. Neither does a GC. I understand this. But, as a hobbyist rehabber, I really do pay attention to it. I'm getting better at working with newer materials in ways that will still meet the Passivhaus standards, but I really do wish the actual trades who are building them (and the people who are buying them, if they're not already a lost cause) would spend a little more time thinking along these lines. 

It's not like we're building a car that has a 10-15 year lifespan, after which 90% will be off the road. We're talking about something that should have 60 years of lifespan with minimal change and should be maintainable for 100+ years without extraordinary efforts. 

Edit: Sorry, wall-o-text. I just got done rebuilding a termite-munched bathroom in Texas that was sheathed with 1/8"" masonite and a brick fascia, designed in such a way that water from the roof could only run down the brick. All that was left was the brick, tinfoil, and an insignificant amount of framing. "

At those rates when inflation is taken into account the money loaned to the UK back then was basically a free transfer of wealth from the US to the UK.

So long as your spending the money wisely in infrastructure and other improvements that will pay off in the long run, running a very slight deficit is good public policy.  Plus all that debt out there guarantees one very important thing.  Other nations/entities have a vested interest in the continuation of your government as they want to be paid back.

POGtastic,AskReddit,1390956362.0,"Actually, as far as I know, it's not illegal for a convenience store to raise its prices like that. Gas stations were doing it when Katrina hit, and nothing happened to them. The hit came later, when the people came back and didn't shop there anymore.

Now - there is something to be said about hospitals having no competition. Frequently, there's only one hospital in a smaller city, and only 4-5 hospitals in a metropolitan area. So, a hospital can charge what it likes, and that's that. Meanwhile, people can say, ""Fuck you, gouging convenience store, I'm gonna shop somewhere else."" If you break your leg, you don't have that choice.

Personally, I think that hospitals' prices should be regulated for that reason. They get a monopoly, and in exchange they have to treat people fairly."

I will say this, however.

To pull your bullshit hyperbole out here, should we spend as much time learning about the firebombing of Dresden as we do the Holocaust? FUCKING OF COURSE NOT. Dresden was terrible, but it's debatable that it was a war crime, whereas the Holocaust was the fucking Holocaust. 

Not everyone is a history major. For most people, learning about history ends when their handed their high school diploma. In that limited time, the FOCUS, not the entirety, should be on things that may help inform us in our lives. The purpose of learning history is and should be to inform us about where we are going based on where we have been. 

What does learning about war crimes committed against us help us avoid? What does it help us do right?

At this point, I feel like you're only seeing what you want to see. You seem to have missed all the different times I have said that his behaviour was disgusting and he's a tool.

&gt;And since when is using a condom risky sex?

It isn't the condom that I was thinking about when I used the word ""risky"" - it's the fact that you slept with someone you barely know, whose STD status you more than likely did not know, who you clearly could not trust, and that your *only* method of birth control was a condom - a condom that you were relying on him to use properly. Putting birth control into another person's hands is a big risk when you are not in a serious, committed relationship with them. And given that it not only broke, but he *did not tell you that*, I'm surprised that you're sitting there denying that what you did was risky - clearly, it was, and it all went wrong.

Condoms are not the be all, end all and should be used with another method for ideal protection. They make sex *safer* but not totally safe. It will always still contain an element of risk. Even the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/latex.htm) acknowledges that. They have a higher failure rate than other birth control methods, and due to the nature of certain STDs, condoms cannot always protect you adequately."

If you're hooking up, hells yeah, it's your responsibility to protect your own body. His responsibility is to protect his. 

He screwed up and failed both of you; but because you left that all up to him and decided to just trust that the condom wouldn't break or that he'd tell you if it did, you failed to protect yourself adequately too. It's not your fault that he was a douche; but the fact that you left yourself vulnerable and protected only by a condom is a problem.

You can try and change the topic all you want and accuse me of slut shaming and siding with deadbeat dads, and whatever else you can drum up. That's fine. The fact still remains that next time you have a hookup, you should make sure you use something other than just a condom, because they have a failure rate of around 18% and that's not great if you want to avoid having a baby. Protect yourself and don't rely on just a condom and another person's honesty to do the job, because as you have so obviously discovered, *it is dangerous* and not adequate.

I could make a version for the 1.1 generation, and the pre-1.1 generation, but those two lists would be limited by a lack of items for certain things.

Also, the list for low-end Hardmode (aka, 1.1 Hardmode) is composed of 50% items that were available in 1.1, and 50% items in 1.2.

The last ability in the X combo is that step-forward downward slash, so after that start spamming A (without moving) until you do the spin-around slash (called the Roundslash, which is your special ability). So: XXXAAA -&gt; Roll -&gt; Repeat.

You can start the combo with a leap attack if you have your weapon out by hitting X+A at the same time. This is a decent gapcloser and does more damage than the first X combo hit. 

You can also do: X+A -&gt; Roll -&gt; XXXAAA. The leap combined with the roll gives you the best gapcloser, and it combos right into your normal combo, with the first hit being a rising hit coming out of the roll.

Also, if your weapon is sheathed, press X+A while holding R to draw your weapon directly into blocking.

Also also, you can do your Roundslash (your highest damage ability) at any point after the first hit of any combo (except after already doing a Roundslash) by holding back on the circle pad (relative to your hunter's direction) and pressing X or A, or by pressing X+A together at any point after the first hit. This is useful if you don't have time for your full combo, but want to do the most damage. Keep in mind that the Roundslash will end your combo outright no matter when you do it. Remember that XXX and AAA are two different combos, so you can't do XXX -&gt; Roundslash, since you'd need to do at least one A attack first."

YES!

It's not that topics of discussion are US-centric, that's understandable. People want to bring up things that they're exposed to, of course. The oppression that you experience and notice first-hand is always going to stick out the most, and when most people in an online community are from the same country, their experience is going to stick out.

However, the fact that most comments assume that everyone in the discussion is from and in the US... that is very, very annoying. The way the words ""we"" and ""in our society"" implicitly mean ""in the US""... I've seen several discussions even about SJ issues in other countries get swallowed up by Americans either not realizing that things are different in different places or just taking every opportunity to discuss themselves, and it's frustrating. I remember a while ago there was a discussion about Norway making military service equal for everyone (this one stuck out because I'm Norwegian), and almost every comment was not just by an American, but by an American thinking they knew what Norwegian society and inequality was like despite having zero familiarity with it. 

In essence, I don't think it's a problem that Americans want to discuss American issues, but I do think it's a problem when people from one country drown out issues pertaining to different countries, societies and cultures and assume that the problems, cultures and systems of opression that they face are universally applicable.

Is this a big deal on the scale of things? No idea, but it does bother me a little. "

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390957979.0,"Governments collect revenue a lot of different ways, there's no one answer on that.  Some places have high sales taxes, others income taxes, others have taxes on resources or businesses.  Every country is different.

One should note that the US government and state governments between medicare, medicaid, VA benefits, and healthcare for their own employees spend as much as a percentage of GDP as countries that just cover everyone.  Yes, the US is that wasteful. 

&gt;I know how it generally works, but I am curious about the details

There are a lot of different models of heatlhcare even when universal.   MDcastle mostly covered the two big obvious logical differences (government owning all of the healthcare services directly, or the government paying private companies to do it, where private companies or people then have to send a bill to the government based on the services performed, and they get paid based on a fee schedule).

&gt;Won't the hospitals become overcrowded with everybody wanting frequent checkups and such, now that it is completely free?

In the short term in the US, probably you'd see stuff like that.  Going to the doctor is still inconvenient though, and people who need it are more likely to go, rather than just hoping they get better.   Expanding coverage to everyone would likely cause a burst of load on the system while everyone who has been waiting on care rushes in.  Particularly the 60-65 crowd who in many cases delay healthcare until they qualify for medicare at 65.  

&gt;What are the negatives and positives of a Universal Health Care system?

The negative is that ultimately it  is the government in charge.  That's a positive too.  But it means if there is a systematic problem with how healthcare is done it hurts everyone.  If there isn't enough  money, if they haven't approved the right drugs etc. you end up with problems.  But of course because the government is in charge they also have a vested interest in fixing it.  What's bad about the city running the police and fire service?  The same applies to hospitals and doctors.   Doctors would get paid less, as government employees (like the NHS in the UK) they would get pensions and benefits though, and the government would be negotiating with strong unions over wages and  benefits, good for the  employees bad for the government balance sheet.  

What's good about it?  It's cheaper, provides on average better care for everyone, it helps avoid the  big problem in the US of people paying a lot of money for healthcare services that are of no notable benefit over much less expensive procedures, and it is the government making a neutral assessment of the efficacy of healthcare services (drugs, procedures etc), rather than an insurance company.  It's also, as I say, by the government, which means when there is a problem - as there was in france a few years ago where thousands of people died in a heat wave, the government has to do something about it.

Of course  the US could run a  giant 'Tbill' fund which is a net money maker but that citizens could buy into for a  guaranteed  low return on investment.

So what is it $1 per new coil, or $.10 to $.15 cents to rebuild them? Think of rebuilding a protank coil as preventative maintenance.

Willravel,startrek,1390958666.0,"I was in debate club once, and that's not how I would have argued. One of the tricks I used to use was making the audience feel like they're wise for agreeing with me by making an argument that seems profound. Ex: 

*Star Trek: First Contact* is an allegory about how our obsession with action entertainment is ruining the pioneering spirit of exploration, be it of stars or of ourselves, in Star Trek. Think about it. 

In the movie, the 24th century is shown as nothing but a huge battle, full of special effects, with Starfleet killing the Borg because the Borg want to, essentially, kill us. There are loud sound effects, menacing villains, bright, shiny phasers and photon and quantum torpedoes everywhere causing big fiery explosions. To break the tension between those, we have badass military commanders barking orders and Worf preparing to commit suicide by smashing the Defiant into the Borg ship. The Starfleet vessels, channeling Picard's pain at having been assimilated, fire back and trigger the explosion of the Borg ship which would undoubtedly leave tens of thousands of Borg dead. When the Borg see that their efforts aren't working, what they do is go back in time, to a time and place when humanity was about pioneering spirit, to make that time also about a huge battle with special effects, with Starfleet killing the Borg because the Borg wants to, essentially, kill us. Instead of the Phoenix reaching warp purely because of the tireless efforts of Zefram Cocharine and Lily Sloane to break the warp barrier, the Phoenix is instead about saving the action-packed future. The past is infected with the future's terrible violence and action-centric plots. Formerly dramatic actors turned aging action heroes help Zefram launch the Phoenix while, predictably, Starfleet and Borg try to kill each other up in space. 

In the end, the Borg are all murdered, much of the Starfleet crew are murdered, first contact (the b-plot of the movie, because the main plot is about the Borg and Starfleet murdering each other over the Enterprise) is made, and the crew of the Enterprise return to the future for their next violent struggle, to fight the Son'a. After they defeat the Son'a by jettisoning and destroying the metaphorical heart of the Enterprise, they then go on to fight the Romulans/Remans and Picard finds a way to fight and kill himself without dying. Murder, violence, destruction, pain, and battle: that's what Star Trek on the big screen became, and *First Contact* tried to warn us as it was happening. We were too busy, though, enjoying the action adventure. 

What are Star Trek's proudest achievements? Are they Captain Picard in a muscle shirt fighting the Borg Queen? Are they the heroic Enterprise E firing quantum torpedoes at the Scimitar in space that's kinda green for some reason? Or are those kinds of things the same action scenes we've seen in a hundred movies? Will Picard driving around in a dune buggy giggling like a 14 year old inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, teachers, and science fiction fans? 

If we're very lucky, some day humanity will make first contact with an intelligent extraterrestrial civilization. That day will be one of the greatest pioneering milestones in the history of our species, like first honing fire, the first written word, the first traversing of an ocean, the first human to walk on the moon. Those are the moments that define humanity, and it's that positive definition, that of optimistic explorers who seek knowledge and truth for the sake of becoming better, that Star Trek explores when it's at it's best. The story of Zefram Cochrine and the flight of the Phoenix is one of the greatest stories in all of Star Trek: coming out of the ashes of a terrible war, understanding that war will eventually lead to our destruction, we instead choose a wholly different path, a path into the final frontier, with the understanding that our greatest achievements lie ahead of us, above us. To use that, of all stories, as the context for an action movie cannot simply be bad writing. It's a warning, clear as day: 

If you don't resist the action-ification of Star Trek, we will lose it's soul. *First Contact* warned us of what was happening just as it plunged a blade into Star Trek's heart. 

Now, it's too late to take heed of that warning, because Star Trek isn't for pioneers anymore. Now Star Trek is for people who want to see giant Federation warships, Khan smashing people's skulls with his bare hands, and tens of thousands of innocent people in downtown San Francisco dying. The audience won't even give the people who died a second thought because the saucer section smashing into buildings looks cool. Gone are the days of Kirk's speeches to aliens being about the foolishness of the Cold War, or the realization that V'Ger is actually our long-lost tool for exploration, or Picard arguing on behalf of Data's humanity, or the wonder of Sisko first seeing the wormhole open. If we're lucky, we get a confusing, awkward 9/11 metaphor that's abandoned half-way through the script because action pacing is more important. 

*First Contact* is neither a classic nor is it underrated. It's misunderstood. "

The game unfortunately doesn't explain combat well, but on each of the village quests, they'll tell you what the purpose of the items you're collecting is. There is a way to check your weapon's moves though.

In the pause menu, go to ""hunters notes"", then ""Hunter info"", then ""basics and controls"", then ""weapon guide"". There you can find info on how to use each of the weapons"

sir_sri,AskMen,1390958795.0,"I think any woman who  marries me would be settling, it's a matter of settling compared to what.  

I'm not perfect, if you want perfection, I'm not it.  People can't wait for perfection - that's unrealistic.  

In  terms of everything else, lets be realistic.  Women do have a biological clock, and your options for fertile spouses are an ever shrinking  pool.  Reasonable people can make a relationship  work, and I think there are  probably a lot of lonely basement dwelling nerds with good jobs and no dating prospects who would make good parents and reasonably good husbands if people would settle for them.

Awesome deadlift though."
vehementvelociraptor,AskMen,1390958827.0,"?? I'm confused. Definitely better to stay out of something you can't appreciate rather than force it, surely? "

ObscenePenguin,DeadBedrooms,1390958868.0,"This is all true, but it's hard to focus on the positives when all you can feel is the burning rage of a thousand arabian suns.

You're right though, I'm finally making some steps in the right direction."
matt_512,PoliticalDiscussion,1390958873.0,That doesn't mean it wouldn't affect people. A lot of people would lose the guns they paid a lot of money for.
DrPepperHelp,electronic_cigarette,1390958874.0,"I see false claims all over that box.

No carcinogens? Is that even a legal claim they can make at this point? Also not to mention the breakdown of caffeine under heat. Does some make it to you? I have no clue, but some people claim it does. At this point I have seen so many ""energy"" vapes that I am not sure that this can even be claimed as the first.
