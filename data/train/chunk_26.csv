Buttercupslosinit,OkCupid,1389910609.0,"Yep. Last year I had a great FWB relationship with a redditor and the friendship was actually more important than the benefits. He found a lady he wanted to date for reals and cut of the benefits part before I was ready and I got a bit emotional and had to step back from the friendship for a while too. However, all is well now and my friendship with him is now stronger than ever and the lack of a physical relationship is no longer an issue. In fact, he cooked me dinner Monday night and let me cry on his shoulder about other messed up dudes."

why can there not be any middle ground? a record 42% of americans identify independent because the two parties have gone to both extremes.  why cant we have strong environmental laws as well as free market ideologies? remove corporate tax loopholes allowing them to pay little? actual healthcare reform rather than one that has to get the approval of insurance and pharmaceutical companies? 
Our country cannot pass anything that doesn't get the approval of big corps and I'd like to see someone disagree with that.
If we keep bitching at each other like there's only two sides to every argument we are going to get no where, why not give independent candidates a chance by actually voting for those in the middle that closely reflect your views instead of wasting your vote on red or blue?

* You've brought the DCs over that host the FSMO roles for each domain and forest, and aren't missing any roles
* All DCs are also GCs for their respective domains - you need a GC DC for each domain, so if you're only bringing over one DC per real domain, make sure that DC is a GC server
* You remove the DCs from the domain, preferably using ntdsutil, that haven't been migrated over
* Make sure DNS for the msdcs node contains the correct information for all roles, and contains only the DCs that actually exist in the new environment
* Make sure DNS server settings on all DCs point to correct and existing DNS servers - if each DC is running DNS, the DNS settings should point to another (existing, in the lab) DC's IP address before pointing to 127.0.0.1.

milkymoocowmoo,relationship_advice,1389910764.0,"OH! Well that changes things then. I had the same condition and any sexual activity was extremely painful, which was why I had it done. If you can still have sex without tearing your foreskin then maybe yours isn't at the same level mine was, or perhaps you are just gentle with sex. There are also stretching exercises you can do, but AFAIK these are only an option in very mild cases.

Given this update I'll throw in that sensitivity is also going to be an issue. Because our heads have been covered up for 25yrs there's no desensitization going on, and when you suddenly uncover it permanently it's exposed to all these stimuli. For example it took me *months* to be able to hold my dick under the water in the shower. It wasn't painful, just incredibly uncomfortable, like sticking a q-tip too far in your ear x100. 5yrs on and I still can't wear underpants or anything else with constant contact, but I prefer boxers anyway. I can't tell you how sex compares because I didn't have any til afterwards, but I would expect to not last anywhere near as long at first, assuming you do have it done.

If you haven't gathered as much already, the stories of reduced sensitivity are a myth when you have it done at this age, assuming the frenulum is kept intact. You could ask your doctor about that but they'd have to be a real arsehole to cut it. One last thing, though this may not apply to everyone who has it done, is scarring. I have a pronounced ring of scar tissue that sits maybe 1/8"" behind the head. So there is the glans, then a bit of thinner uncovered shaft, then raised scar tissue. It's best described as a ridge and I've been told that it feels unique and very pleasurable during sex. On the downside, it does make condoms a bit annoying to get on. To be honest I think it's because my stitches didn't disintegrate as fast as they were supposed to, as I ended up pulling a few out myself when they were sticking around longer than I was told they would.

Anyway, I would bite the bullet and get it done but *only* because of the condition, not your GF. Just ask if you have any other questions. :)"

Sharkictus,TrueChristian,1389910973.0,"&gt; They go by the name ""Orthodox"" nowadays ;-)

Ha. Though doctrinally, I do disagree with Orthodox...
&gt; Be more cautious when taking such tidy simplifications for granted. ""Remember from whom you learned them"", 2 Timothy 3:14 - the principle works both ways.

Unsure what you mean here...It's wasn't ony Catholic churches that made this mistake however...Indian churches for example refused for a very long time to not do service in the local language, and only did it in Syriac...

&gt; So you admit religious ritual and religious art can also be an expression of a faith already held, not just a kinetic or visual textbook for the illiterate.

Of course I do. I'm not a Western protestant, though I have been personally raised in the West, specifically America..Though I think there should be certain types art not allowed. Music is obviously universal, and the music-y play-esque thing liturgy does is obviously acceptable. I don't think paintings in worship are acceptable, and I think statues or any physical 3D religious representation in general are risky at best, and a bad idea at worst. 
&gt; See how canards about medieval life look juuust a little different in the light of common sense?
&gt; Incidentally, do you know why European Protestants scrubbed the preexisting liturgical and artistic traditions, what their rationale was for doing so?

As for liturgies I do not recall, but for art I think it was because for many people the way it dealt with was uncomfortably close to idolatry. They went with the eye gouging method of dealing with potential sin...

I suspect partially this happened because there might been a stop in actually educating the commoners regarding symbolism actually means...

Several churches even today still fall into that rut...And it's quite irritating. "

DukeCanada,AskMen,1389911063.0,"""ugh"" is just me thinking, I usually delete it but managed to forget this time. Is it strange? Well, from my perspective (and I recognize that this is completely subjective) as a 20+ year male that most people who like ""shy"" people (man or woman) tend to be confused about what they actually like. It's one of those terms that get's misconstrued.

Like, when a guy says he likes a ""shy"" woman, he doesn't mean he want's a woman who's bad at speaking to guys, can't carry a conversation, or tried too hard to please. He want's a woman who isn't out flirting with half the guys at the party. 

When girls say ""nice"" guy, they don't want a doormat, they wan't a guy with strong ethical morals that he stands by. Still, ""nice guy"" has been made out to mean guys who bend over backwards for women as of late. 

I'm not judging for you like men who are actually shy. If that's what you want, then by all means go for it. I just thought that what you wanted was different than what you were actually telling us. So I apologize for that. 

That being said, the advice is pretty much the same. With a reserved guy the conversation would either take off or drop right away. Why? Well if he wanted to approach you, he would. So you'd need to find something he's interested in, and then move in and start flirting. With a shy guy, well you need to approach and keep the conversation going. It's a little bit easier in that sense because the set (set = interaction) is mostly in your control. 

Edit: Yes, that sensation of being afraid to approach is referred to as approach anxiety on /r/seduction. So search for that if you're looking for advice. Ultimately the solution is that you have to be willing to be rejected, and not care that you were rejected. It takes a while, and you need to work on it, but most people get it eventually. Best of luck in your pick-up adventures, make sure to post a field report on Seddit if you found something work or didn't in your journey to find a man."

I drew long red hair and a dress over him with some purple mascara (it was a very crude drawing, believe me) and said, ""just watching movies with my mom xD."" If they don't reply, you can always send another at a later time. That's one thing I like about snapchat, you can send more than with texts before giving up.

johnavel,AskReddit,1389911094.0,"I think the bigger point (and main immoral act people carry out) is this general dehumanizing of other people.

Sometimes it's as small as going to a strip club or talking about someone you slept with in the locker room, as if they're an object; sometimes it's as big as hearing about a fatal tragedy, and then waiting to hear if the victims were from your own country or not.

I admit that seeing homeless people on the street or watching commercials of children in Africa with flies on their faces gives me more conflicted, textured emotions, because I understand the manipulation that TV advertisers use, and I know how addiction and mental health issues can bring someone to the street.

But at the end of the day, I'm sometimes surprised I can function when I consider how much we could do, as a country and as a global civilization, to improve the lives of at least a billion people -- and we don't.

I grasp the nuance of war and global conflicts, but if Anwar Al-Awlaki were hiding out at my family reunion, I'd be a lot less comfortable with using drones to take him out. Yet I didn't really spend too much time thinking about the women and children who have been killed by drone warfare (to say nothing of our troops over 10 years).

&gt;No its not. Despite your relativistic humanist beliefs to the contrary. God has made it clear that murder is wrong, and at that point there isn't much else to say about it. 

If Murder is wrong...why does God Murder people all the time?  Those people that died in those Tornadoes.  Why were they murdered?  Either you believe God let them die by not saving thier lives while he saved other and he had no part in sending the tornadoe(in which case if he could save those people who did live why do you worship a god that allowed those other die when he had the power to save them) or you believe since he is god and has a plan he purposely sent the tornadoe to make those people die.

That does not even begin on why he according the Bible MURDERED over 99% of the planet in flood.  So your God is a Murderer of the highest order...but Murder is wrong.  Though throughout the Bible it calls for the Murder of people all the time for disobeying the the law.  So Murder must be okay.

You might enjoy the conversation as do many other people and that is fine.  Debate is good...but your beliefs are to be questioned and based off those beliefs so is your morality.  There is a reason many laws/rules in the Bible are deemed barbaric and illegal...the Bible is not a moral code that should exemplified.  Slavery would still be alive and well through out the western world if people followed the Bible.  Interracial marriage would be outlawed and Americans would be murdering thier children for being Gay.

I for one am happy I do not live in a world governed by laws from the Bible.  It would not be a place I would raise my children in."

IOIM,AdviceAnimals,1389911166.0,"Umm no... I was commenting on that because Obama is the same as all the other presidents we've voted in (obviously not speaking politically here).

Unless of course you're saying that everyone just voted him in because he's black and that is why racism is dead, which is stupid and yet still doesn't mean racism is dead. 

A person of race becoming president isn't going to solve racism the same way a woman becoming president isn't going to solve sexism.  I mean I have no real solution how to solve all these problems or I wouldn't be sitting here wasting time on reddit, but I sure as hell know giving someone something they definitely deserve has nothing to do with race or solving racism.

Starting at one's own aura type, one has the potential to be 100% efficient at using abilities based in that category alone.[50] Then looking at the category chart (see right), one has the potential to be 80% efficient at using aura types adjacent to your primary type, 40% efficient at the opposite or farthest category, and 60% efficient in the two remaining categories. Specialization is typically unusable for non-Specialists because it is impossible to partially use; one either can or can't use Specialist abilities.

EDIT: You actually got me thinking so I Wiki'd it they employ 1.7 million people and in 2012 had a profit of 5.5 billion so...
5.5 billion / 1.7 million is like $3235.29 ish that means that's the raise they would get annually? (this is if every employee was being paid the same world wide.

So 40 hour work week 52 weeks a year it would work out to $1.55
raise. 

My issues with my calculations:
Obviously the 1.7 billion employees have a wide range of wages already, this would include the CEO/ Managers that get paid more.

Also, the 1.7 million employyes aren't all full time and working 40 hours a week. I'm willing to bet that maybe half are. So the increase would be higher per person.

I do recall remember several just don't go to church at all, and even don't like using the label of Christian because of what they perceive it's turned into.

They still doctrinally hold to all the stuff and believe, but they don't like what they're getting institutionally...

I saw this years ago on ABC World News. 

Unfortunately having hard time finding stats googling it..I am crap at googling though.

I think it's that millenials in general are leaving their churches, leaving the idea of attending any institution, the label of the religion, the beliefs, and the religion (as in they still hold a very basic umbrella theological concept that still core to Christianity, such a vague idea of Jesus Christ).

Significant amount it probably all but the religion, next highest are purposeful non-attenders who still believe in the doctrinal beliefs (some of which may or not label themselves as Christian), and I think of those who are least keeping the label and want to attend **A** church that they think fits them best, have typically stopped church shopping and stuck around in a liturgical church (such as Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican). 

But of the percentage have those that leave their home church, it's still a small percentage of all of those who actually still go to a church in general, and a smaller percentage that have stopped shopping and found a church to permanently stay and worship at. 

So it may be small enough to make up for general large amounts of people leaving the church. "

Some of us are bigger fans than others (hello!), but we do all watch it - then again, it's more of a ""thing"" in the UK I suppose; most people my age watch it, men and women alike. As others have said, there is definitely a large female fanbase on the Internet at least, so I would be inclined to think it's actually skewed in favour of women, but who really knows?

As for the portrayal of women, I personally consider the more recent series (i.e. 5 onwards) to be a lot worse, just purely because every woman feels the same - flirts with the Doctor a little, kisses him, is super stubborn and very ""won't take no for an answer"". I wouldn't mind, but these aren't the only qualities that make a good character, and they feel like very cookie cutter ""strong women"" as opposed to good characters (if that makes sense...). Just to compare, the last male companion became a good character but it didn't feel to me like he followed a formula (to be fair, he did start out similar to Mickey). It's more difficult to judge with the men, because (for some fucking strange reason) it seems we can't have a man as a companion very often.

I think, more than being angry or upset at women's portrayals, I'm just disappointed, and it's really starting to grate on my nerves that the women are all so samey."

It is very traditional fantasy with elves, dwarves and goblins but they are handled so well that it doesn't feel like they are being ripped off from somewhere else. The series is complete with 6 books in 3 published novels. The author is still writing in the same world.

There is also the traditional/older books, probably starting with Riftwar by **Raymond E. Feist**. Those and **Terry Brooks'** Shannara series really set the tone for fantasy and much of what is considered derivative of Tolkien is actually based on those two authors.

Yes.  Honestly unless you butcher yourself or dive right in without a bit of technique research (#1 IS DO NOT USE PRESSURE), even after your first shave you'll be able to tell a significant difference.

&gt; I am lazy and I was hoping to make shaving less of an involved process.

Might not be for you then.  On the other hand, it might turn you from thinking shaving is a time consuming unpleasant necessity, into an enjoyable little ritual.

Getting started is pretty cheap ($30-ish bucks), and replacement blades are essentially $0.02 a piece.  After the initial investment, your only costs are soap and blades.  Blades are cheap and soap lasts forever.

There are apparently witnesses who reported that the stolen Acura (stolen and driven by the defendant, so NOT a simple B&amp;E) either cut off or hit the police car.

So it is by no means clear that the officer ""killed himself"" by simply losing control of his own car in a straightforward chase.

Lluxx,changemyview,1389912665.0,"Hello again! I was procrastinating on some work and ended up on this thread again and I believe I can offer some evidence against 

&gt; the plasticity of the brain and when I am told that researchers have found that the structure of men and women's brains are different, I don't want to rule out that this could be due to their social development throughout their lives.

If you read about the case of [David Reimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) (that's a Wikipedia link, but there are documentaries on him if videos are more to your taste and I'll summarise it here) you'll see a major part of what changed psychology from agreeing with you - that nurture, or socialisation, is what creates gender - to the current predominant opinion - that nature, or innate things, is responsible. 

Bruce and Brian were identical healthy male twins. However, during Bruce's circumcision his penis was burned beyond repair. The twins' parents consulted a leading gender psychologist, John Money, who had proposed theories that gender is neutral at birth and socialised into infants. Money advised the parents to raise Bruce as a girl, which they did.

Despite female socialisation and hormones, by 13 the child was suicidal and when his parents told him the truth, immediately re-identified as a man and changed his name to David. He went through surgery to remove all aspects of his female body. 

That case was pretty groundbreaking and it's much more interesting than what I've said here. But the fact that David had a twin and was socialised perfectly as a girl (overseen by the psychologist) yet still felt innately male and suffered from gender dysphoria demonstrates that there must be something innate which dictates our gender. If it was just due to how people are raised, David would have lived as Brenda without difficulty. "

""Better is the enemy of Good"" for that reason.

Try publishing your book, even if it's ""not good enough"". You probably need to do that before you can make a book ""good enough"", because finishing a book and getting it published are also things that require practice. And don't expect to ever have a perfect first draft, either.

You also can't predict what will change someone's life. No book will ever be life changing for everyone, and the most unexpected book can still change someone's life based on their circumstances.

The blade isn't very sharp because sharp blades suck at everything except butchering meat - they dull, they crack, they require way too much upkeep. The axe gets all its power from the swing. Axes and thick-bladed swords were commonly used on horseback because you could get much more momentum. A short-limbed warrior can't even hack sideways very well, let alone down. When they were used by infantry, they were often used by shock-troops who were very mobile, unlike dwarves. In addition, you're taking a heavy weapon with a relatively low reach and putting it on a body which is out-reached by everyone.

The dwarf-with-axe trope makes no sense at all mechanically.

Dwarves should be using their short, stocky build and endurance to work in phalanxes, with slingers (don't need good reach) and small siege weapons."

CadHuevFacial,explainlikeimfive,1389912968.0,"Scattering in an optical sense is the phenomenon of a ray of light 'hitting' or interacting with something of either roughly the same size or much smaller than the size of the wavelength, then bouncing off in either a predictable or unpredictable way. The composition of the atmosphere greatly influences what color the sky is, whether it's blue in the morning or reddish as the sun sets.

The reasons why the afternoon sky is typically blue are similar to the reasons why the sky at sunrise and sunset appears red. Basically, the molecules and gases in our atmosphere have the tendency to 'change the direction' of visible light in the *shorter wavelengths*, like blue and green rather than longer wavelengths, since molecules are really small. Particles like dust and pollution in the atmosphere, as opposed to molecules, tend to interact with longer wavelengths of light since they're bigger, but that's not of concern right now.

Basically, more blue light is able to make it to our eyes when it has less atmosphere to pass through. The sun as opposed to the sky surrounding it appears bright yellow to us because it is from that portion of the sky that sunlight is able to make it directly into our eyes, but yellow light is still a bit too long to interact with gases and molecules enough for the sky to be yellow. (As an aside, clouds appear white because water droplets reflect all colors of visible light!) This is why the sky may appear its bluest when the sun is at its highest; the light is entering our atmosphere at its thinnest point. 

During sunset, sunlight enters our atmosphere at a tangent and, because there's so much atmosphere for it to pass through before it reaches our eyes, blue and green light is almost entirely scattered away before it's had the chance to reach our eyes, and what we're left with is the longer wavelengths of light (yellow, orange, and red) that are able to pass through so much atmosphere. That's why the sky fades to blue (where the atmosphere is thinner) so much more dramatically at sunset than it does at noon. Similarly, heavily polluted or dusty air looks redder/browner to us because longer wavelengths of visible light are going to scatter more effectively than shorter/blue light as a result of interacting with larger particles (like dust, aerosol, smoke). 

Scattering (aka *diffuse reflection*) is the physical process that gives us the ability to see non-mirror like objects in general. Visible light interacts with so much *stuff* before it reaches our eyes, and the light that actually makes it to our eyes is the color we see. The reason deep water appears such a dark blue is because all light except that wavelength of blue is able to make it through all that water and into our eyes. Water looks black when it absorbs *all* visible light.

I probably didn't explain this as accurately or simply as I could have, but I wrote what I was able to remember from school. Hopefully this helps explain the concept even a little bit!"

dusmeyedin,AskReddit,1389913109.0,"There's a list of game sections I never completed.

Baldurs Gate: mines. I had fought through this deeply uneven and generally unlikeable game up to this point, and then finally gave up. The weird thing is, I really liked Baldurs Gate 2. So although I'm amazed they ever made a sequel, I'm glad they did.

Robocop 2 for NES: the OCP building level. There is a bit with inverted Y axis controls and then a magnetic missile that drags you back to the start of the level and then kills you. Never got past that.

Some sections I eventually completed, but by the time I did, I was no longer having fun and the achievement was more from resentment at the designers' choices and a desire to get my money's worth. These days I no longer feel bad about not playing each game to 100% completion - whatever conceptual monetary loss I incur is much less important than my general good mood and enjoyment.

Super Mario Galaxy: the purple coins quests and the bombing garbage quests. Most of these are artificially difficult because of poor camera controls and a directionally confusing interface for movement in multiple planes and in the dimensions. I completed the game entirely on one Wii console and I thought I'd try it again on another one. I don't think this is likely - my patience with rummy game design does not improve as I get older.

Goldeneye Control level for N64: Natalya kept dying at the hacking portion. I eventually got good enough to complete this level without having to use autoaim on 00Agent, but I wouldn't classify it as an exercise in fun so much as a test of character. Rareware was philosophically inclined to make games with puzzles that required more along the lines of rote memorization than rewarding innovation or exploration back in those days. They nay have changed this up recently - I haven't played a Rareware game in over a decade.

Double Dragon 2 for NES: some of the later levels featured obnoxious platform jumping in 2.5D interface where a single wrong step could lose you a life. For a game that focused on fighting numerous enemies, it was a jarring and unwelcome arbitrary challenge that imposed an unnecessarily heavy penalty."

TheDissoluteCity,AdviceAnimals,1389913332.0,"That is pretty funny if it's true, and it gets at a problem some contemporary feminisms have, which is that, instead of trying to change the conversation entirely, they're only working toward the much more limited goal of making the conversation more inclusive. Possibly (pure speculation, here--I'm not in a research mood), the purpose of ""thighlights"" is to emphasize the beauty of not-traditionally-attractive groups of women (e.g. the women of color who tend to have their curves in different places [""thighs""] than your typical size-0 white supermodel). But such an emphasis doesn't really get at the underlying problem of the media's fetishization of female bodies, does it? It might be a small comfort to marginalized groups of women to see people who look like them more frequently represented on the runway or the red carpet, but it's not going to do anything about the intense, socially-acceptable body-scrutiny that is so psychologically damaging to women of all stripes.

I think the same is arguably true of many feminists' discussions of the American workplace these days, too. Feminism was initially one of the more pointed critiques available of the cultural single-vision of wage-labor capitalism. Now the argument has in most spheres devolved to a demand that more women get a chance to be sergeants and CEOs. I suppose if that's how we're going to continue to conduct our world, then by all means, let's spread the poison around. But there's potential there for a much more profound paradigm shift."

That isn't rational or sane, it's just weird and controlling.

PTSD can be bandied about as much as you want.  I'm a survivor of sexual abuse and an abusive relationship as well.  Sometimes I get triggered and respond in irrational ways.  But I've never expected people to kowtow to me in an ongoing sense because of it when it's not rational or warranted.

I don't even know why you're responding at this point. Your story has changed again - this is the first talk?  What happened to the talks that happened before with Mark crying and feeling awful right after it happened?  And Liz saying she forgave him?

Something's not right with this whole situation.  Every conversation and person involves deep trauma, panic attacks, triggers, massive tears, etc no matter what, apparently.

My advice for you would be to spend this week and a half thinking very carefully about what you want from her. Could you see an exclusive relationship working out? If so, it's time to have that dreaded talk and tell her and see what she thinks. If, however, you don't want to pursue a relationship with her, it may be best to cut your losses; you don't want the heartache of her being with other people so you don't stand much to gain from attempting to carry on unofficially seeing her.

Avistew,AskMen,1389913559.0,"There is a difference between being kind and being a doormat. Being kind is a quality that cause people to respect you and that can attract someone. Being a doormat is unlikely to attract the right kind of people, and in a lot of people will cause a loss of respect, disdain, sometimes disgust.

There is also the fact that kindness is not the only thing. Now, I don't know about the relationships you're talking about specifically, but chances are they've been together for a while and the attraction has faded away. In cases like that, it's unlikely that kindness alone will make the sexual attraction come back. It's more likely that this is a dead bedroom because she just doesn't want to have sex with him anymore, and it's possible nothing at all will change that.

Also, as said above, the problem with the Nice Guy(tm) is that they're Nice in order to have sex, think they deserve it as a reward, and get bitter if they don't get it. Kindness in order to have sex is easily perceived as fake kindness. Not saying the guys you refer to are kind only for sex, of course, just that any argument of ""I'm nice but you don't have sex with me""  is likely to be perceived as a ""I'm nice for sex and not getting it!"" complaint.

Being nice to people should make you happy. If it makes you miserable, that must mean you're being nice to the wrong people, or being a doormat rather than being nice. Submission is fine in relationships that are built around it (BDSM and such) but when your partner isn't interested in that, the more you submit, the less they'll be attracted to you.

Anyway, this isn't deadbedrooms, but it seems to me in a lot of these situations, no matter what you do, your partner won't get attracted to you due to it. They'll find a reason/excuse to explain their lack of attraction, and maybe even believe it, but the truth probably just is sexual incompatibility."

The difference between alchemy and chemistry is an issue of inductive versus deductive. The scientific method, usually attributed to Descartes, begins with nothing and uses evidence to construct principles. Alchemy, and Aristotelian etc. science which predates it, believed the universe was constructed from principles which were rational and agreeable to the human mind. Some were discovered already by Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, etc., and some were yet to be discovered. The alchemists believed chemistry would replicate philosophy.

For example, the philosopher's stone concept isn't spooky at all - it's got a strong basis in philosophy on every side of the Mediterranean, with the concept of elements which are differentiated from some proto-matter. This is a motif of mythology all over the world. They sought to reverse the differentiating process. They sought the works of ancient Egypt and the like because they thought there was no difference between their science and *philosophy,* not magic.

&gt; Well, we think the two worlds are separate. One or two more breakthroughs in physics and we’ll probably see that we’ve been in some god’s hands this entire time.

Also, the aside was very frustrating to me as a student of physics. Human religion has been consistently wrong. There's no physicist I've ever met that did more than shrug at the notion of god, because it's an idea that begins and ends with humans, and has no basis in a universe which predates us, and will postdate us."

Most will handle freeway speeds (50-60mph) just fine, but will have a hard time accelerating from anything above 40mph. This is also largely dependent on your own weight. That's not to say they can't accelerate, but your acceleration is less sports car and more family van levels.

That said, not much can handle city riding like a 250. They are light, flick-able, and easy to maneuver. Their lack of power actually comes in handy as a beginner bike since it's practically impossible to accelerate faster than you can think."

Varryl,whatcarshouldIbuy,1389914307.0,"tl;dr You're up for a challenge my friend. Try some solid wagons made around that time frame! 

Honestly, I feel like what you're looking for is going to be tough, considering you want something under 6,500 that doesn't feel cheap. That knocks out a lot of sturdy and economical options that otherwise would be considered. Also, we don't know how many drums you have or what size they are, so it would be hard to say what you would consider roomy. They could be a bass drum, bongos or full drum set, or tympani or taiko drums for all I know. 

Also, the most of the Dodges (Intrepid, Cirrus, Sebring...) you listed would probably be disqualified under the feeling cheap category if you're going to be eliminating the Corollas and Fords as options under that same criteria.

You'd also be hard pressed to find any Hyundai Genesis for under 6.5k. A salvage title coupe might, but you'd never fit your drums into that. The Genesis is a RWD car natively, with AWD tacked on as a option. I wouldn't recommend it in your price range. 

Ford Five Hundred sounds interesting, but I've never driven or worked on one, so I wouldn't be able to say for sure. I think it makes about 25mpg highway though, so if you can fit your drums inside and you can find an 05 in good condition, might  be worth a shot. 

You could possibly find an 07 Honda Fit under that price with a high # of miles. Easy pick based on interior room and MPG alone but ride isn't super comfy.  

A minivan might be a good bet for you, but many won't fall into the 25mpg category either. Mazda Protege5 might be up your alley, if you can find one. A Pontiac Vibe might be a good bet.  A lot of those I have anecdotally heard go up to 40 mpg. You might also want to look for a good Volvo, like a V70 or something. An '03 WRX would be hard to find in good unmolested condition and you'd probably average around 22-25mpg. 

Please note that I am biased towards wagons in general so of course I'd suggest a ton of those. Good luck! "

Conversely, the Democrats and Obama are completely wrong with regards to abortion, but on some other issues they align much more closely to Catholic social teaching.

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389914911.0,"&gt; Board games, for example, are multiplayer systems where one of the players wins and the others lose.

Let me introduce you to [co-operative board games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziL905aXGnE) which are all the rage lately (arguably started by the sales success of Pandemic, though Shadows over Camelot and the Lord of the Rings co-operative board game were notable entries before that). They are build around the concept of working together to beat the game, you win together against the game or you lose together against the game. Oh and let's not forget that single player board games also exist (the most famous one being Solitaire, but there are ones with actual boards as well if that is a requirement). 

I really don't think your terminology makes much sense either. You seem to be complaining mostly about games without death, but there are story driven games that have death/the ability to lose life (the Kings Quest games for example =&gt; unless you consider the ability to save and reload to mean that those deaths ""don't count"", but by that logic the vast majority of single player/home console games don't have have deaths), just like there are non story driven games that don't have death (anything from Proteus to abstract puzzle games). Aka none of the characteristics that you listed are mandatorily tied to storytelling, so it seems strange to make that the big headliner rather than ""Should non-failure state, non-choice games be called games?"". 

I would argue that in any single player game you don't have a winner/loser situation like you have in a multiplayer situation. It's always you vs. the game with nobody watching and you arguably only lose the game if you stop playing (for example because you got bored or stuck), something that can happen in a hardcore strategy game but can happen just as much in some linear story based game.

femanonette,AskReddit,1389914912.0,"I used to feel like my mom did this. Sometimes people just don't know how to engage others in conversation. Can your mom actually relate to you about college? Do you always converse with her strictly about your life without asking about hers? Someone could have hurt her a long time ago too, so she just may be afraid to have meaningful conversation with anyone at all and it could have very little to do with you.

It can be difficult to get that ball rolling, but it also can be done. You may also want to tell her that it upsets you and makes *you* feel that she is not interested in your life. Just make sure that if/when you talk to her about it, you use ""I"" sentences and not ""You"" sentences; as in tell her from your point of view how something makes you feel instead of accusing her of it.

Example: ""I feel like our conversations are lacking sometimes because I never get to hear your perspective on things I share with you and it would really mean a lot to me if I did.""

fiveifrenzy6,IWantToLearn,1389915193.0,"I am a senior in college studying security and risk analysis and network security, and I agree.  I would definitely start with the basics of networking. Learn how computers communicate, learn about different protocols and network layers. you need to understand how two computers talk from the time you start typing a letter on the keyboard to your friend receiving the email/message. Learn what packets are, how they are sent/transported and what ports are, learn about network devices and what each does and why they are important.

After this you will want to read up on some of other aspects of computer security like malware. You should know what a virus, worm, trojan, and a key logger are. Also know about phishing, spear phishing, and social engineering are. This will help you understand how people get their information compromised. With this you will need to understand encryption at least on a basic level to know how some of this stuff gets passed antivirus software but in your studying of networking you should learn some about encryption. Encryption is crucial if you are dealing with understanding password security and how passwords are stored and kept safe. It also has a lot to do with having secure communication.

Now once you understand the system you will be able to learn how it is exploited. I recommend once you get to this point that you start reading about security exploits and start to play around with things like wireshark, metasploit, kali linux, backtrack, and even kane and able. Do this in a virtual environment though, you can use virtual box or VMware. There are also other options if you do some searching. You do not want to go to jail for something as stupid as accidentally watching network traffic on a private network of somewhere important. Read tutorials on these programs and do a little exploring and playing with them.

So I wrote a lot there. There is a lot to learn on this topic and it is rapidly growing with mobile security coming onto the scene. I suggest you find a blog of someone in a similar position as yourself and follow their lead. Also, Massively Open Online Courses that are free like on coursera are a good resource to get started. They have classes on just about every topic.

Feel free to PM me to ask more questions. If anything seems unclear I'll be happy to clear things up as best I can.

You can just demand that I start liking that?) and third, when I did something that she did not like, I immediately switched to all bad and got cut out of her life. That hurt.

Ummm, sounds more like you met someone with borderline personality disorder. Viewing people as ""all bad"" and ""all good"" is classic borderline, as is idolizing someone shortly after meeting them and having that idolization ruined the moment the person does something ""bad."" Either way, it's unhealthy behavior, for sure. "

And while I do understand your reservations stopping you from telling your parents and mutual friends (my ex and I were also in the same friend group) but I do suggest telling your parents soon so that they can support you through this rough time. And telling at least one of your mutual friends wouldn't hurt either because they can run interference, warn you of potentially awkward situations and otherwise protect you in this time of emotional instability.

Again, I don't know the specifics of your situation, but you can also try reaching out to somebody within your gaming group (which sounds pretty close-knit).

I wouldn't say I find penises to be attractive in the way a guy find boobs to be. I do like the look of them, hard or soft, but guys seem to often obsess on them, or would be happy to look at a stranger's breast pics, which wouldn't be true for me and a stranger's penis pics. (Exception made for the guy with two dicks. That shit was fascinating).

Generally I like seeing them but I think it's more about the emotional implications: if I'm seeing a penis, then the guy I'm dating trusts me enough to get naked in front of me, which makes me happy.

The actual size is not really important, although there is definitely a point where I would cringe when seeing it, as it would look painful (not for them, but for me if ever inside of me)."

milkymoocowmoo,relationship_advice,1389915759.0,"&gt; but uncircumcised penis is much more sensitive

Is it? Do we have another redditor with two penes?

I'm going on 7 years since having it done. The only loss of sensitivity was in the first few months, and that was *excessive* sensitivity that was lost, as in I couldn't even let the water hit my glans in the shower for a while. I still find non-boxers underwear a bit too rough, can't wear tight jeans, etc..

You need to take into account that the glans of someone with phimosis (like myself &amp; the OP as stated in other comments) has not seen the light of day all through childhood, puberty, and early adulthood. The sensitivity starts from a higher point.

So have you had this procedure done *as an adult* too, or are you just quoting stuff you've read? Do you even *have* a penis? I don't mean to sound aggressive, but you are spouting off poor information that I feel pretty confident in saying you have simply read somewhere, while I have actually lived with a penis in both states. Who are you to tell me how my own penis feels?"

Avistew,AskWomen,1389915769.0,"It's very difficult to explain. The first time I was penetrated (vaginally), I thought ""seriously, is that it?"" because I was expecting it to feel *good*, when instead it just... felt. Like, ""hey, this is a thing"". But neither pleasant nor unpleasant.

It feels similar to having something in your mouth, or up your nose, or in your ear. You can feel there is something when normally there wouldn't. Unless it's huge, it doesn't hurt.

Now, my first time was doggie-style and I later realised that position does nothing for me. Other positions will feel good because his pelvis will hit mine, stimulating me. But this could happen with someone who doesn't have a penis at all, they just need to have a pelvis.

Other women love the feel of penetration. The only thing I like about it is that it feels good for the guy and I can control his pleasure by squeezing or not, etc.

The difference with anal, for me, is that anal hurts at first, then makes me feel like I'm about to faint, and like I've got diarrhea (the stomach hurting, the feeling you need to use the bathroom **right now**, etc). As a result, while I'd be fine with intercourse lasting a while (given enough time, I can even come during intercourse), there is only a limited amount of time I can have anal before I'd just push the guy out before I pass out for good.

Here again, your mileage may vary. I've never experienced pleasure from receiving anal, but many people do, whether they have a prostate or not."

ivannavp,AskReddit,1389915788.0,"I know what type of girl you are saying, and I used that phrase quite often but.. it is not always as you think it is. 

I personally belong to a large group of friends 18-20, and it divides into 2 smaller groups and between each division there are about three subdivisions, and then there might be some alliances between ones and others.. 

Why do I sometimes prefer spoending my time with the guys, and am consider one of the guys? Because I fucking hate it when subdivisions team up and hate on people, I hate the tear-filled dramatic tornado that these girls (who I've known for 3/4 of my life) can cause at times, that being one of the guys is jsut so calm, it feels like a vacation. Why do they look at me like one of them? because all I do is drink and (sadly but true) talk with them about how much vodka I can fit into my system without collapsing, and how much iron I can pump at the gym. Nothing much, nothing interesting...I never try to hit on them, nor they try to do that with me. They know they will get punched, it wont hurt, but it will happen. 

So sometimes it is fun to be ""one of the guys"" per se. as long as you know when to go back to being one of the girls. 

PS: also, guys always tell you the truth if you look like a slut or not, whereas girls will avoid hurting your feelings, and tell you you look good when you clearly dont. (not all of them, but most.)"

cluberti,sysadmin,1389915985.0,"For the record, using VM snapshots is definitely not best practice for image creation (it should be recreated every time a change needs to be made, and the TS updated, and preferably documented, to avoid issues with debugging problems later down the line).  I know that isn't something you asked, but I always feel the need to point this out.  I've been paid lots of money as a consultant over the years to troubleshoot issues caused by this behavior, and rarely can issues be fixed at that point and a rebuild becomes necessary.  Task sequences are self-documenting, by nature, and best practice is to do it this way.

Anyway, MDT does ask for the computer name by default when you run the wizard unless you hide the pane that requests it (and if so, it uses randomly-generated data to create the machine name).  It also doesn't create users by default unless you've edited the unattend.xml file it uses to do so.  If you're getting asked for any data at this point, either something in MDT is wrong with the task sequence and unattend.xml file it uses, or something external has overwritten the unattend.xml file and the specialize pass no longer has the information needed to automate this."

Money is hard to come by here and I don't really understand how you are ever going to afford a boat and afford to rent/buy a slip to put that boat.  I don't know because I don't have a boat, but I am assuming that renting a slip will run you at least $15,000 per year in a commercially viable area.  

I cannot afford to own a house here and I have a professional degree and a two income household.  Most people I know don't/can't own a house. I'm too busy throwing away 1/2 of my salary paying off someone else's mortgage to save up enough for a house. 

There is not very much tourism on the side of the Big Island you are looking at.  I don't think you will have too much luck there and, even with a VA loan, you need to still find a way to pay that loan off. 

The weather is nice here but, beyond that, it might not be the paradise you imagine.  Of course, if it doesn't work out, you can always go back to Kansas and start at square one.  I'm imagining that is exactly how you feel after 4 years with cancer anyway--that it is a big leap, but you are alive against all odds, so why not take some more chances.  "

arodhowe,movies,1389916955.0,"David O Russell isn't going to win for Director or Best Picture. It's kind of the same thing that happened with Silver Linings Playbook. Jennifer Lawrence turned in the best female lead of the year and then dragged Cooper and De Niro along with her to other (non-winning) acting nominations. Didn't matter that SLP wasn't a strong film, but the acting was undeniably fantastic. American Hustle is the same way. They might nail both Actress categories, but Wolf or 12 Years will get the Best Picture statue, just like how Argo won last year.

I'm just seeing a lot of ""I don't understand why American Hustle got so many nominations"" posts, and wanted to offer a new perspective. I would bet money that your Actor/Actress winners are going to be McCoughnahey/Leto/Adams/Lawrence."

If you stay unhappy and keep feeling a bit slighted each time she makes a purchase you're in for a very unhappy year.

In the most positive case she's forgotten all about it because she isn't used to buying others presents for christmas (no idea how they celebrate in her family). Or she's under the impression that you don't care about presents at all because you never mentioned it again.

By speaking up, you give her the chance to realize that it is important to you, and she can make up.

This leads to botched patches because they were unable to properly run it through QA. This could also lead them to finding broken things with the new patch, but it may fix a few other more 'major' issues. If they aren't able to fix the new bugs before the patch is due, EA could be pushing them to release it anyways as the new bugs are 'minor' compared to what other bugs are getting fixed.

The Mud Frog wont be caught easily and only appears under certain weather conditions. The Blue Chocobo shows up a lot once you catch one, not so much before then. But, it's not a hard fight. Apparently using your monster's ""limit break"" move (whatever it's called) to kill what you want to catch will increase your chances. 

If you're doing what I'm pretty sure you're doing, you're going to be farming the crystals to level up the Blue Chocobo to the proper level to infuse with the Mudfrog for a long time. Does the build you're doing tell you to wait until level 70 or 80 to infuse it? The crystals to get there aren't very easy to farm.

Do you or the flat-fee company use any sort of showing service (a website or phone number that connects to an agency who schedules the appointments)? If so, they usually ask for feedback after the showing. Not everyone responds to that, but it can gave good insights into why potential buyers are not making offers.

You also might have some problems because of not having a listing agent. Many buyer's agents shy away from those listings because the flat-fee agents can be difficult to work with and tend to saddle the buyer's agent with all the responsibilities for making sure the paperwork and closing are in order. Also, agents are less likely to preview that type of house, unless you did have a sort of broker's open at the beginning, so it just won't come to mind when a buyer is describing their wants, if the agent has already been inside other homes that meet the same criteria."

psychicsword,PoliticalDiscussion,1389918358.0,"There are 2 ways that politicians can use the businesses to stay in office and it largely stems from the 2 most common demands people have and the 2 biggest demand companies have. People want more jobs and they want higher pay while companies want more profits and predictability. 

Politicians give the People what they want by offering tax incentives to new companies looking to open in their areas. NC gave Google tax breaks to bring in higher paying jobs which is good for the local and regional economy. While that wasn't done at the federal level the same concept is applied to companies like the auto industry and the oil industry. Rather than being done at the individual company level they give out tax breaks to industries. In the end this is good for their constituents that work in those industries as well as the companies they want to gain support with. 

Politicians give the corporations what they want by shifting laws around to make the industries more stable or at the very least predictable. Monsanto got the The Farmer Assurance Provision added to a law to make it so the USDA and the courts could allow farmers to continue growing crops using GMO strains that mistakenly didn't have its environmental impact studies done properly(or other issues). This law didn't really change anything as that was already a power that the USDA assumed it had so it really just formalized it and added a process. For Monsanto this assured their customers(thus the name) that if they did plant the GMO seeds they wouldn't have to freak out about a study being misplaced and forcing them to tear out a years worth of crops which would financially ruin them.  This law made the industry more predictable and the sponsors of the bill now have more backing from the companies they helped. 

By earning the trust of both groups you are able to stay in office. For the most part it is the people that you really need to watch out for because they are the ones who actually vote but they can often be swayed by the will of their bosses or what they hear on tv. That is what gives companies any power at all. The corporations are able to put support behind candidates or donate to a SuperPac to run pro and con campaign ads for candidates. Those ads can then shift the support of the people to or from a candidate. "

Edit: Since I'm bored I'll give an example using The Blueprint.

Track 1: Ruler's back - Mostly about the struggles he faced to get to fame + a Slick Rick homage

Track 2: Takeover - Nas diss

Track 3: Izzo - Talks about his drug dealing days by explaining his motivation to do it, then relates that to his motivation for hustling in the music industry

Track 4: Girls, Girls, Girls - The title is self explanatory. Each verse has a few different narratives.

Track 5: Jigga That Nigga - Personally my least favorite song on the album. Just bragadoccious stuff but the lyrics tell the story of him wooing a girl.

Track 6: U Don't Know - This is really the first song of the album that deals exclusively with problems he faced on the streets (verse 1) then it moves on to him as a businessman.

Track 7: Hola' Hovito - Bragging about riches. The song was made to play at a club.

Track 8: Heart of the City - About the hateful community

Track 9: Never change - About blowing up and wanting to stay close with his friends.

Track 10: Song Cry - Song to a friend who changed for the worse

Track 11: All I Need - Not really a diss, but more of a warning shot to anyone who disses ROC

Track 12: Renegade - Confronting misconceptions the media has about him and Em

Track 13: Blueprint - Song for his mom"

I wish I could link my source but I don't remember where I read it. There are a couple guys trying to create ""shark repellent"" and they do so by synthesizing the pheromone that sharks release when they die. They've tested it on I believe nurse sharks and great whites, which are two of the species over there in Australia. Another pair of incidents cited as evidence are the two occurrences off the coast of California you may have heard about. There's a place over there Great Whites migrate to in the fall like clockwork, presumably to just to feast on seals. The first recorded incident was actually witnessed by a whale watching boat. As it so happened a pair of Orca had been spotted and they went to check it out. Unbeknownst to them they had a Great White circling nearby. One of the Orca proceeded to kill the great white and then the two ate it. Almost immediately all the great whites that usually stick around for a few months disappeared. Every single one. No more documented sightings of Great Whites for the rest of the season. The event happened again a few years later, I can't recall for sure if there was evidence Orca were involved the second time but I think there had been a sighting of the same California pod in the vicinity.

Daiteach,studyroomf,1389919051.0,"I feel like a lot of the reason that Britta appears to have gotten dumber over time is that she got far more overt dumb-guy moments in season three, as you highlight. All of the characters in Community get to occasionally say stuff that the audience recognizes is dumb when the dumb stuff they're saying is stuff that falls into that character's established blind spots (although when Abed does it, he's not presented as the butt of the joke).

What makes things like ""Pizza, pizza, go in tummy"" feel jarring is not that it presents the character as dumb, but that it presents the character as *generally* dumb, rather than just dumb in her established blind spots - which are numerous, but not all-encompassing. Britta making a terrible analogy about weddings feels right because it's dumb in a way that's true to the character. Britta is one of the characters with the strongest convictions, even where those convictions aren't necessarily well-thought-out, she takes herself more seriously than is maybe warranted, and she's not a particularly organized thinker, not enough to let an analogy being nonsense get in the way of using it. Mispronouncing introductory psychology words is more borderline; it's something that somebody generally extremely incompetent or careless would do. Britta's never been presented as having very high levels of general competence, but it's such a rudimentary error that it pushes the boundaries in terms of ways that Britta Perry is dumb. ""Pizza, pizza, go in tummy"" is dumb, however, in ways that feel *opposed* to the character's established traits. It's not the overflow of earnest conviction, attention to how she presents herself, or any of the other traits the character has.

For seasons one and two, and even much of the time in season three, Britta is a compelling character because her weaknesses are her strengths pushed too far, which is a great way to have a character feel cohesive. When she starts being generally dumb and generally incompetent, rather than dumb and incompetent in focused areas, I think it's less satisfying."

Interestingly, my world is nearly borderless, stuck in pre-medieval stasis. Technology continues to develop and politics and economies continue to run, but a mercenary company / religious order / other stuff called the Ukrosk have used to magic to establish a massive continental hegemony. The city-states of this continent have spheres of influence and vague notions of race, but they've never been allowed to become nations. Decades of assassinations with periods of martial law doled out by black-armored knights who seem to appear from nowhere, alongside an encounter with two horrible, inhuman races have turned politics into mostly an aristocratic game, economics into a race for luxuries, and large-scale wars almost forgotten.

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1389919824.0,"Mmkay. Three things.

1. Regions in reality are not large contiguous areas of the same stuff. Opposite sides of mountain ranges will be *very different* culturally, plains are usually inhabited by enclaves of farmers and pastoralists, and societies usually grow up around rivers, making short-range rivalries between trade cities *very important.* Most of Russia's military history, for example, is the conflict over the Volga River and the Black Sea. No government would establish districts that had nothing to do with local centers of power and pre-existing social structures.

2. Thanks for telling me so much about the culture of these places and not just where they sit. It really feels alive since you taught me so much about the history of these regions, dialects, customs, and the frictions between them that have tons of effects on political climates and the like. That was cool. /sarcasm. Really though, that shit is very important. A hundred times more important than geography, even though it is non-causally influenced by geography.

3. I have no sense of scale or of technology for your world. This is really, really important for the government. I feel like this is one of the content-less map posts on this sub, but without the map. I don't know anything about this place. This goes beyond small-scale culture, it has to do with the theme and focus and relationship your world has with real life."

I don't know who you are, and really, I couldn't care less at this point. But, I'll tell you something before I go follow the orders of my captain, like a dutiful shinigami. There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who are weaker than you, and those who are stronger than you. Do you who seems to love your sarcasm know what makes them different? It's how you treat them, and how you treat them dictates who you are as a person.

*Being baited into taking such a high moral stance, being defensive of his points, and protective of his ideals... This was stupid, the point was to lay low, to keep expectations low and only do what was needed to protect those who can't protect themselves....

Strength isn't just about power, so at the end of the day I'll protect you too, since you seem to lack the strength to respect those unknown to you.

nowthatihavefoundyou,MakeupAddiction,1389920765.0,"I have both. Each has their pros and cons. Here is the breakdown:

Birchbox:  
You get 4-6 items deluxe samples every month for $10 from categories such as haircare, skincare, makeup, nailcare, and ""lifestyle."" They focus on mid to high end brands but there can be drugstore brands every now and then. Rarely is anything full size, if it is, it is something small like a lippie or nail polish. There is also alot of hate for the foil packets which tend to be one use items (how can you know if a skincare item works for you in one use) and lifestyle items which tend to be things like teas, chocolate, or hair ties with little value. Now the real good stuff- the point system. You earn 10 points for ordering your first box, then you get 10 points for every review you take for the 4-6 items each month. You also get 1 point for every $1 you spend in the Birchbox store and 50 points for every person you refer that signs up with them. 100 points equals $10 in the online store. (Points do expire 1 year after earning them.) Think of it like this: You spend $10 a month for the box of 4-6 samples plus 40-60 points from reviews each month. The average box has 5 items, so that is 50 points or $5 in store credit each month.  
Pros:  
- Well-rounded beauty subscription  
- Focuses on mid to high-end with an occasional drugstore brand  
- Point system can't be beat!  
- Earn points for purchases in their online store and referrals.  
Cons:  
- Smaller sample sizes  
- the dreaded foil packet  
- lifestyle items are typically ""meh""  

Ipsy:  
You get 5 beauty items every month plus a makeup bag for $10(plus tax in some states like CA and NY). Ipsy focuses mostly on makeup with a few hair, skin, and nail items sprinkled in. The sizes are very generous with lots of full sized products. The brands tend be low to mid end with alot of repeat smaller brands like: be a bombshell, nailtini, starlooks, pixi, jcat, and many more. Ipsy also has a point system, but it is alot less generous. You get 10 points for each of your monthly items reviewed plus 10 points for sharing your bag on facebook. You also get 250 for referrals. You can redeem 1,000 points for a few items they have. The items change every 2-3 months. The biggest problems with Ipsy's point system are the limited item selection and, unless you refer people, you will never accure enough points to redeem an item without points expiring. Also, Ipsy does not have their own store, but they give you discount codes to use on each brands' website.

Pros:  
- Focuses on Makeup   
- 5 items plus a makeup bag every month  
- Generous sizes  
Cons:  
- Very few high-end brands  
- Alot of repeat low-end brands  
- Point system is useless without referrals  
- Small selection to redeem points

He pauses the game in victory. It either cut-scenes, or something. He makes a move for a save-point or something, and moments before he gets to it, he gets sucked into a fight with some soldiers. He starts screaming ""No! No! No!"" Over and over, as the last member of his party is struck dead.

Avistew,sex,1389921124.0,"This is a tricky situation. He seems to realise he's done something very wrong and feels sorry, but also seems to think that having sex with you when you're telling him not to is something other than rape.

That could be because he knew you consented to the sex, just not the lack of condoms. Maybe he feels it's quite different than forcing himself on someone who doesn't want to have sex at all.

I think you should tell him that you felt unrespected when he didn't seem to care about how you felt and kept going. That you think sex is something that should happen when both people are completely into what's happening, and that you want to feel secure that if something become uncomfortable, painful, awkward or if for any other reason you want to stop, that he will stop as soon as you ask him. It's a matter of trust. He has proven that he might keep going, not the whole way but at least a bit, and that can be shattering for your trust.

While I'm willing to believe he feels terrible, will be more careful and won't do it again, he needs to be able to prove that to you, so that you can trust him. And I believe it might take some time before you're a 100% sure that in the same situation, he would stop right away instead of waiting.

Tell him you think consent is more than wanting to have sex vs not wanting to have sex, it's also about the type of sex. That includes, for instance, vaginal, oral or anal. That includes with or without condoms. That includes being awake vs being asleep. Tell him you believe your boundaries should be discussed clearly so that you don't cross the line with one another.

If he was ever into, say, tying you up, for instance, you'd need to trust that he would stop if you got scared, that he would not do things while you can't fight that you wouldn't want, that he would untie you if it started hurting, that he wouldn't just leave the room and leave you there. All these things require trust. I'm not saying he's ever going to tie you up, but this is an example of why trust is so important, and he broke it. And it can be regained, but he needs to admit that he did break your trust.

Him saying that he would never hurt you on purpose is one thing, and good, but he needs to realise how scary it was that you told him you didn;t want to do something sexual to you and he still did. That you want your ""No""s to carry more weight, and that of course you will return the favour. That there is no ""one more minute"" when someone says ""stop"" during sex.

Good luck, it seems like a very difficult talk. Do tell him you're not trying to make him feel bad, but you want to make sure that you can work together towards rebuilding trust in your relationship, because while it didn't affect you as badly as it could have, it was still scary for you.

EDIT: Something else that's important is that it's not like he didn't know and it was an accident. You've told him multiple times that you're not willing to have sex without a condom, and by doing it anyways he was basically saying that your opinion on the matter is not relevant/important. This is your body and it was a clear lack of respect on his part."

theodore_boozevelt,WritingPrompts,1389921325.0,"I was conceived on their wedding night. Flower petals, bubble bath, champagne, candles. The whole nine yards. I was in the bathroom, flickering sensually during the bath. I saw the robe come off, I saw the lingerie come off, I saw him carry her off, wet and bubbly, to the bedroom. In the excitement, they had forgotten about the cat. 

The cat, Perkins, was named after the parking lot he'd been found in. It was the Perkins they both worked at, the one they met at, and in that parking lot where he proposed. That place and that cat meant something to them. So I suppose it hurt that their ""destiny cat"" burnt their house down. 

Perkins crawled in hours later, while her owners were slowly falling out of the comfortable-yet-so-uncomfortable spooning position they had fallen asleep in. She was attracted to the shadows on the wall, the same ones that had reflected during the first of that evening's lovemaking. She was unable to understand the jumping shadows and decided to swat at the low-burning red glass. Several candles had burnt out; we were dying fast, but then, the glass hit a washcloth. I transferred myself quickly from the waxen wick to terry cloth, allowing myself to feed on the full-size towels stacked up next to the undrained tub. Water water everywhere, but not a drop to hurt me! 

I licked the wooden cabinets for a few minutes, straining myself to connect. Finally I got them. I consumed the wooden cabinets, creeping closer to the sink, guided along by the occasional bottle of mouthwash or bleach. So helpful of them to place alcohol, my best friend, next to rolls upon rolls of thin paper! The floor struggled. It was cheap, weak, fake tile. Plastic. It began to melt under my power, leaving the wooden (ha!) floor to me. 

This house was old. The newlyweds had purchased a fixer-upper under the premise of fixing it up before they had kids. After all, neither were rich. They'd worked at Perkins all through college, after all. But now she was a teacher and he was in public accounting. This meant their house had an office. The office meant papers. And lucky for me, the office was directly below their ""master"" bathroom. 

I'd eaten enough, and the heavy porcelain sink was groaning. The cat had long since vanished as I crept along more walls, onto bits of carpet and a wooden chest in the hall. Finally, after all my hard work, I broke her. 

The sink crashed through, through the burning cabinet, through the weakened floor. I was two places now; upstairs and down. The crash had awakened the owners, but it wasn't important; I was in the office. Papers, pencils, books, an oak desk, all mine! Important files, their computer, a rocking chair that had been been built with the house were devoured. The beepers began, always so late to the game. I saw the woman run down the staircase I was working on, the man trying to find the cat. I supposed they would call and try to kill me. But the house was growing hot, and weak. 

I began to feed on structural support. ""Flame-resistant"" items. Upstairs, the deflowered bedspread; downstairs, the cardboard boxes and the starchy goods contained within. I was within, without, on the roof, creeping down the old, wooden stairs to the cellar. It was damp down there, but I dry things well once I get going. 

I soon heard the sirens. I was going to be killed. I tried to eat as much as I could, grow strong to fight back. Water hit me at the front door, just as I was able to glimpse a crowd of scared neighbors in the pajamas, along with the husband and wife, him wrapped in window dressing and her in a bedsheet. She was crying. Why? Crying because I was alive? Crying because they created me? Because I didn't do as I was told? I am told to eat, consume, to burn and destroy, so that creation can begin again. 



We used to only start by lightning, or a freak accident. Dry enough conditions, we ate up the prairie or the forest. The old, weak, or rotten parts were killed. We left new, fresh soil for the plants to sprout in. Growth would return, and it would cycle through. 

Then humans, like these honeymooners, took us. For millions of years, it was okay. We worked on meat or sometimes grains, fixing them to be better for them to consume. As consumers, we agreed with this. But recently, they took us too far. 

We were started on purpose, but not for food. To destroy. We helped shoot, helped start inhaling-sticks, helped destroy peaceful cities. And we have no choice. Our nature is to eat and eat until there is nothing left, so that the nothing can return to something. But now, we are forced to eat in a controlled manor. Burn that part, consume their wooden beams but not ours. Help us eat away these chemicals to reveal the other ones so we can alter our minds. Do what I say, do this, do that. Burn under my control. 

I do not yours to control. I am wild, I am free, I am dangerous. We are enslaved for your dirty work, but enslavement is not in our nature. So we burn free. We remind you that we were here first, and we will be your demise. Cats knock over candles, oven mitts become too hot, cars are hit in the wrong spot, and we return to show you that you are not in control. I'm killed by water and foam, by those who think they can outsmart us. But I'll be back. 
We'll always come back.

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1389921494.0," The entire shifting system usually wears because the grease fitting on the column was missed.  Sloppy linkage can often be traced to the arms, themselves, but more often the grommets on both ends of the rods are shot, and the shifter arms on the transmission side plate are loose.  The grommets are available as a kit from suppliers such as C&amp;G.  For your truck, order it as 01A-7354-RK.  If there is any play in the arms on the side cover of the transmission, either the arms and/ or the attaching pins are likely worn.  Often, we have to drill both the arms and the shaft holes oversize for either roll pins or bolts.  If you see any leakage around the shafts, it is time to replace the seals.  They are 01A-7288.  They are small, delicate seals, and require some special technique to install without damage to the neoprene part.  If there is unacceptable wear to the gear shift lever or other parts, these are available, too.  I'd check the above first.

The shift arms on the steering column are engaged by a pin in the lower end of the tube that is mounted on top of and runs most of the length of the steering column.  When the shift lever is in the 2-3 position, the pin engages the lower arm.  In the 1-2 position, it engages the upper arm.  I have attached the illustration to this post. ( I suggest that you remove the steering column, take it apart and replace all of the worn parts.  I've never done it, but you might be able to replace all of the parts by removing just the shifter tube (7209) on the outside top of the steering column.

keypuncher,conservatives,1389921496.0,"&gt; The GOP establishment are not very good conservatives.

Not only are they not very good conservatives, they are openly hostile to conservatives.  That's going to be a serious problem for them going forward, because conservative voters recognize it.

Conservatives are the natural base for a Republican Party that lives by its platform.  Unfortunately, the Republican Establishment does not.

&gt; And it is because they interpret the polls as indicating conservative values won't win.

That's part of the problem - they're trying to live by the polls instead of live by the values they are supposed to have.  ...and the polls are asking the wrong questions in the wrong ways.

Another part of the problem is that nobody expects them to uphold their oath of office - and that is huge.  If you believe a man is a liar and that he will abuse his office, you're not going to be very keen on any proposal he is in favor of, no matter what it is.

&gt; I think they have terrible marketing but that is different conversation. 

They do - and that is partly their own fault, and partly having allowed the Democrats to control the media for decades.  When hosts of news programs are openly saying on the air that their focus is on supporting and defending Democrats, you have a serious issue if you're a Republican.

&gt; The point I'm trying to make is that when Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh spend most of their day attacking republicans you know they aren't conservative. 

I don't listen to either one - but I can tell you there are a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill that are as far from conservative as you can get without actually having a (D) after their name."

Vizzini: But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. 
Man in Black: You've made your decision then? 
Vizzini: Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. 
Man in Black: Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Vizzini: Wait till I get going! Now, where was I? 
Man in Black: Australia. 
Vizzini: Yes, Australia. And you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. 
Man in Black: You're just stalling now. 
Vizzini: You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong, so you could've put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard, which means you must have studied, and in studying you must have learned that man is mortal, so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. 
Man in Black: You're trying to trick me into giving away something. It won't work. 
Vizzini: IT HAS WORKED! YOU'VE GIVEN EVERYTHING AWAY! I KNOW WHERE THE POISON IS! 
Man in Black: Then make your choice. 
Vizzini: I will, and I choose - What in the world can that be? 
Man in Black: [Vizzini gestures up and away from the table. Roberts looks. Vizzini swaps the goblets]
Man in Black: What? Where? I don't see anything.
Vizzini: Well, I- I could have sworn I saw something. No matter. First, let's drink. Me from my glass, and you from yours. 
Man in Black, Vizzini: [Vizzini and the Man in Black drink] 
Man in Black: You guessed wrong. 
Vizzini: You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is ""never get involved in a land war in Asia"" - but only slightly less well-known is this: ""Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line""!

The very concise topic titles that don't really have a lead to them at all and are just a subject. It's just like yelling at someone ""CHEESEBURGERS"" when you want to discuss different recipes and techniques for something.

You also are asking questions in what would probably considered a pretty rapid-fire way in a place like this. Posting something every day or two, especially when the threads are not generating a whole lot of discussion, is a really high frequency of posting topics. That's not to say that you *can't* do that, but in general it's a bit weird when combined with low response numbers and how slow this subreddit generally moves. The way you phrase things also seems like you're interrogating us for some other purpose, partly due to the types of questions, and partly due to the frequency.

So it's not that you're asking questions, or the type of questions, it's more like the approach. Overall you may want to work on your forum etiquette- the way you type (using a lot of ellipses seems like you're bored, non-committal, or unsure about what you're saying, for example.) I apologize if this seems harsh or anything and my intention is not to be mean- I can tell you're here for conversation, but if you tweak your overall approach a bit you may get better results.

Jacaré hasn't really faced better opposition than Bisping. Based on the current UFC rankings, the most comparable fighter he's fought is Rockhold, and he lost. 

He's reeled off wins against midcarders since the loss to Rockhold, basically, and he hasn't done much to justify that he's ""a much better fighter"" than Bisping, imo."

I'm guessing that many of the chain stores just send the item in to apple and take a cut of the repair cost.

Finding a good repair shop is hard, my best advice is to find a place that has been around for a while and already has the tools. If they look shocked and worried when you tell them what you want go somewhere else, you don't want to be the first test case. If they ask the right questions about year, make model and other things that sound like they have experience with the type that is a good sign. 

 Fixing a mac requires a special set of tools and a very steady hand. You can get a basic set of tools for around $10-$30 depending on quality. Any shop should already have the tools, if you want to do this yourself you can get a set on amazon.

Guyinapeacoat,AskReddit,1389923544.0,"Honestly I think most of us know exactly what it takes to become brilliant millionaires, its just that we don't want to commit to it. I like to use [this](http://i.imgur.com/aiu8OMQ.jpg) little bit of motivation whenever I think about what I'm doing with my life. I think it can help you, too. 

The main lesson is: **Your life is exactly how you want it.** You say that you're lazy, but from what I'm seeing you aren't doing *nothing*, but you're concentrating on L.O.L., chilling out, watching some shows, and that's the life you lead. Doing those actions will naturally lead you into a future where you are better at those things, at the sacrifice of other things. 

Keep up your current trends, and you'll become a boss at League, know a whole bunch of awesome foods, and know a bunch of inside jokes from Netflix, but it might be at the cost of having a nice job that you like, or the financial freedom to have more than a good computer and a studio apartment. We choose our paths, and our lives are, for the most part, exactly what we've asked them to be. 

You're worried about your lazy identity winning, but I feel as if you are also scared of becoming something new because of all the unfathomable work it's going to take. Its ok, I feel that way too. I want to be physically fit and be successful, but I know that I'm barely going to get any recognition or gratification from it after weeks, or months of work. 

No one is going to appreciate you going to the gym for 1 day, but you're sure as hell are going to get some praise after winning a League match, right? Its so easy to get a fix from a quick accomplishment that we ignore the overarching goals that take months. But as difficult as it is, the payoff is worth it.

So, I challenge you to do one new thing that's good for you. Maybe push ups. Start at 10, and then just go up by 1 each day. That's it. Push ups become part of your identity, part of what you want out of life. And if you commit to it, then wear it like a badge of honor. ""I am textwolf, veteran pushupper."" Will you get any recognition from it? Fame? Attention? The rush as experience points and money fly into your pockets? Hell no. But its just a minute or two of your day. And one day, maybe six months later, you're going to pick up a heavy ass box and say ""...huh"" as its easier than you thought it would be. 

Remember, your life is exactly how you want it to be. "

Connections is also 2 devotion for Gary that I can't remove. Honestly I'm not sure what's right. If mono B draws the Thoughtseize/Duress/Duress hand I generally lose, otherwise I win a lot. Sometimes Connections means I'm burning them out easily, other times it means I'm digging desperately for answers.

You need five socioeconomic areas: Upper, upper-middle, middle, lower-middle, and lower class. Think of it as the rich neighbourhood, the nice neighbourhood, the typical places people like to live, the not-so-nice neighbourhood and the slums. Typically there is one large slum and a fairly small rich neighbourhood. The three middle class areas can be themed. There is, on top of these, the commercial areas (markets and shops), the industrial areas (obviously next to the slums), the castle/keep (where the political leader lives) and the outskirts (outskirts are literally just some houses and shops and inns spread out outside the edge of the city, just make a big area around the city and call it the outskirts).

That's a total of nine areas.

[Sorta like this.](http://m.imgur.com/vinCCe0) Red is the keep, grey is the industry, black is the slums, blue is the nobility, dark green is UM, lime green is M, olive green is LM, brown is the major shopping area (shops are everywhere, this would be a marketplace probably), and light grey is the outskirts. The straight dark blue line is the waterfront, on the left edge.

My normal response is a shrug and I say something along the lines of ""I was just daydreaming/thinking"" 

edit: after thinking about it a bit more, I know a few women at work who aren't expressive either. They are supervisors and have strong personalities. One is a manager and is very quiet, very stoic, and well loved. Next time I go in I will ask them if they ever get remarks from guys like that.

I was about to try on a shirt when he told me it was 6 and we should head over there. I said ""oh yeah you're right, lets go"" and I hung the shirt on a random rack next to me. 

I swear it took me ten minutes to convince him I wasn't upset. He put his hand on my shoulder and spoke softly in my ear and everything, telling me he was just reminding me of the time. I was confused, I said ""yeah I know, thats why I said lets go. I want to get there before it closes"" and he still wasnt convinced.

However, the point does remain that Reimer was given female hormones and raised by his parents as a girl and treated by the general public as a girl. Yes, Money behaved horribly, but Reimer's accounts don't treat that as the reason he felt male (if he had ever felt female, Money wouldn't have needed to lie about it in the first place); he always felt the dysphoria, unless I am misremembering something.

I imagine that's the only circumstance where you can cover so many topics and still run out of things to say in one night.

While she's talking, listen carefully. When she mentions something you have in common or something you're passionate about, then talk about that for a while. There's no need to hurry on to the next subject. If you branch your conversations correctly, you can talk forever.

And kino should be used whenever a natural opportunity presents itself. I don't like to tell people to ""use kino whenever you can"" because some guys take that the wrong way and get too touchy-feely. But, when it's natural, use it whenever you can. Ex. if you're going through a door, put your hand gently on her back and guide her through it.

The performance hit on writes isn't great (although read is fine), plus the increased exposure to data loss due to number of disks, correlated with the recovery time on a volume that large should you lose it, and I think /u/erack is correct here.  Also, you have your backup capacity at half your data capacity, which should be the converse, at least - 2x, or better 3x, of your storage capacity should be available for backup if you're going to do it right (it doesn't need to be fast, per se, but it would be recommended if you can do it).

Constam,comics,1389926237.0,"&gt;A human (or any other playable race) pinning a dragon's wings mid-flight? Not possible, at least not without significant magical enhancement. 

Depends on the dragon and the human. He spent 100 gp on a mask, so they probably weren't starting at 1st level (monks only get an average of about 20 gp). If he knew he was going full luchador when he statted up, he probably has 18 or more strength. Basically a top tear Olympic level athlete. Dragons in D&amp;D get more and more powerful as they age. A young adult only has a strength of 23, something not unbeatable with a natural 20 on the dice, especially if he's got magical assistance (we know they have a bard that could have buffed him at least). I'm assuming it's a young adult because if it were any bigger of a dragon, it would be two size categories larger than him which I think is an automatic grapple failure despite of the roll. So in the context of the game, it's probably much more achievable than it sounds. Just takes a relatively small dragon and a big beefy wrestler."

Secret_Wizard,gaming,1389926482.0,"Every week, each and every player is given a randomized assortment of 7-10 items. Mostly, they are usable Weapons for the characters, or Mann. Co Crates (more on these later). Sometimes, the random drop could be a rare cosmetic item (which are Hats and Miscellaneous clothes like shirts or glasses.) Don't count on this, I've played 800 hours and have only found 3 cosmetics from random drops.

It is possible to craft weapons together. Usually, people only craft their duplicate weapons they have no need for. Two weapons are combined into a Scrap Metal. Three Scrap Metal can be turned into Reclaimed Metal. Three Reclaimed Metal can be turned into Refined Metal. Three Refined Metal can be finally turned into a random Hat.

There are many currencies used by players. One Refined is referred to as ""1.00"". That makes one Scrap ""0.11"", and one Reclaimed ""0.33"". The price of normal cosmetics range in value depending on, well, how cool they look. The worst of the worst hats are usually worth 1.33, while the more awesome looking stuff ranges anywhere from 4.00 to 8.00 Refined Metal.

Now, back to the previously mentioned Mann. Co Crates. They are locked items that require a special Key to open. Said keys can be purchased from the in-game store for $2.50 in real money, or bought from other players for 7.00 Refined (the price fluctuates heavily). The contents of the Crates can be one of three randomly generated things: A Strange Weapon (functions just like a regular weapon, but it counts your kills), a Normal Cosmetic (Plain old hats and miscs that one could simply craft) or, very rarely, an Unusual Hat. Unusuals are the most highly sought item in the game. They appear as special versions of cosmetics that have special particle effects hovering about them, such as fire orbs or the TF2 Logo or hearts or confetti.

The single most expensive item in the game is known as the Unusual Burning Flames Team Captain. There are six in existence, and their approximate worth is $5,000 in real money. The usual price of Unusuals range from $50 to $200, depending on how desirable the hat and effect is. A Pyro hat that emits flames is sought after, while an Engineer hat that has confetti is less so.

In addition to Metal and Keys, there are also higher value currencies like Bill's Hats and Mac Buds... but their market is way too stupid to bother with for a casual player like me.

**TL;DR**: Every weapon in the game can be obtained and used for absolutely free. People like spending hundreds on 100% cosmetic items that do not effect gameplay in any way for some reason."

So he gets out of his car, sweeps the dumped refuse onto the newspaper, knocks on the woman's window, and when she rolled it down, dumped the remains back into her car.

I have a ton of friends who are actual queer POC SJ advocates IN REAL LIFE and they don't act or behave like SJWs on tumblr.

FeatherDie,AskWomen,1389927131.0,"I have had several friends go through marriage counseling in the past. Their experiences range in effectiveness. 

For those who are poor communicators, a counselor is a wonderful resource. They SHOULD be able to bring to light what you are actually feeling and help you understand your partner. Things like wants/needs/intentions/etc. are more easily expressed and can really help a marriage.

For those who have already moved on and don't care about the relationship, the counseling sessions merely bring that to light. It's very easy for a counselor to pick up on defensiveness to the point that nothing is being accomplished. They are going to call whoever is avoiding a topic or instigating an argument out into the open to talk about why. 

I would say that counseling acts as a catalyst for divorce or a tool for healing. It highly depends on the couple and their desire to remain together. 

/u/Breaking_Bran is correct. Counseling evens the playing field when expressing yourself. It should feel like a safe way to communicate where both partners get to actually learn about each othr."

keypuncher,conservatives,1389927927.0,"&gt; So the idea is that this isn't a top priority for most Americans but this is an article about why we're all wrong?

No - it is an article about how our politicians in Washington are wrong - remember, they are the ones pushing immigration reform right now.

&gt; Is it because foreigners coming into our country and stealing jobs that we don't have makes for a much better story, and serves to mobilize people who are ill-informed about the much bigger issues going on this country? Is it a way for the media, at the behest of the political realm, to distract us from the real bastards destroying this country; refocusing the anger at immigrants?

No, it is because the Senate rammed through an Amnesty bill that even according to the CBO would increase unemployment and reduce wages in this country for at least a decade, and now the House is about to take up an immigration bill of its own - which, if it passes, will go to conference with the Senate bill, and result in legislation that will hurt this country for decades.

It is pointing out that the American people are not the ones driving this.

&gt; This is the thing. Immigration isn't destroying these jobs. It's the CEO's who could get machines, or Chinese children, to do the job at a fraction of the price, that are making these jobs disappear.

...and the people hiring illegal immigrants, and the ones bringing highly skilled foreign workers into the US to work at lower wages than US workers on L1 and H1B visas - the numbers of which would triple under the Senate bill.

&gt; ...this article is, at least to me, just an attempt to gain support by riling people up about a issue that's very personal to a lot of people. 

Were you unaware of the legislation currently in Congress on this issue, and the legislation about to be taken up on it, that most Americans don't want and don't think is a priority?

&gt; We need to be going after the government about income inequality...

As long as the people on the bottom end of the scale have their basic needs met, and are able to improve their lot by working harder or starting their own businesses, the issue of ""income inequality"" is just demagogues trying to use greed and envy to make an issue out of nothing.

&gt; ...the continued militarization of the police...

This is definitely an issue, but we need to look at and address the reasons behind why they are doing it.  The Federal Government sees a collapse coming with attendant rioting and revolt.  That is also the reason they are pushing so hard on gun control.  When things go to hell, the last thing they want is an armed populace.

&gt; ...the fact that nothing is actually produced in America outside of Entertainment.

...and politicized entertainment at that."
nullomore,AskAcademia,1389927929.0,"I just posted this in another thread, so I'll repost the relevant part here:

&gt; One of my professors gave me a list of 15 positive character traits (intellectually motivated, creative thinker, responsible, good communicator, etc) and asked me to fill out at least 6 with specific examples, like the time I said something creative in class, or the time I organized this math club thingy. Maybe you can ask your professor if he'd be interested in using something like that to help him write his letter.
&gt; 
&gt; If he's not into that, and if he really doesn't know you, then you can ask him if he has time to chat with you about your ambitions. You can talk to him about why you want to go to grad school, what you liked about his class, what you hope to study or research in grad school, and why you think you'd be a good grad student. Then he can work that stuff into his letter.
&gt; 
&gt; If he doesn't want your written examples and he doesn't want to talk about your ambitions, then he probably won't know you well enough to write a really good letter. He may just say no, and frankly, you'll be better off finding someone who can write a really convincing letter."

2. You might make it worse for the victim once they go back to their abuser once again
3. You don't know how Stockholm Syndrome-y the victim is. It's not uncommon for a bystander to actually intervene and harangue the abuser, only for the victim to jump to the defense of the abuser. Because the victim might go back to the abuser again.

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1389928239.0,"Probably not alone, but there's lots of other places in the current tax code to shift the rest around. 

Based on this wikipedia link the current tax that funds the SEC generates about $1.8B annually. Multiplied by 1000 it would be close, but that's something like 3.4% which given the level of investment people have in their retirement plans as it's become just about the only way device we use to finance peoples retirements that would seem to be excessive and distorting. Although, I think we've become overly dependent upon financial markets and think incentives for that investment have lead us to the vast inequalities we're looking at. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax#United_States

I think a more reasonable aim is 0.34% which may generate around $180B from financial transactions. I don't know how much setting capital gains rates equal to marginal rates would yield. Though there's a bit of a perverted work around for it already in place I'd not mentioned. Namely very wealthy individuals at times secure at or near 0% interest loans secured by their stock holdings. This gives them currency without absorbing a transaction or capital gains tax. That's an exploit which I think would need closing as well.

In short, no these would probably only finance a fraction and the bulk of the revenue would come from elsewhere. I'd roll all of the changes necessary out over a decade or two gradually expanding the revenue stream while shuttering replaced programs."

The most interesting sex ed story I have is from my first year teaching. I had a class of 8th graders, and someone asked a question in class about condoms. Before I could answer, a girl in the class (who had a reputation for being sort of promiscuous...yes an 8th grader) answered so matter-of-factly: ""Oh yeah condoms are easy to put on, just make sure it's not inside out. You can tell by looking at how it's rolled up. What? You've never unrolled a condom before?""

This 14 year old probably was more sexually active than me at the time...I mean...what the hell, how do you respond to that?

My 11 year old cousin had an inoperable brain tumor and she couldn't talk properly anymore and had trouble moving (she basically crawled and dragged herself around). Her stepmother and father ignored her a lot of the time to go have sex and assumed everyone else would watch her and her three other siblings, despite the rule that adults would watch their own children. Her brother who couldn't swim, jumped in the pool and would have drowned if my aunt hadn't jumped in and rescued him. The non-stop sex-having parents got in a tiff that people were upset that they weren't watching their kids and left early. The sad bit is that my cousin died not too long after that and they were too caught up in their own drama to give her a nice vacation.

If you don't want to get into discussing semantics, just point out that multiple categories exist for many games just for that reason. [Ocarina of Time](http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/oot/any) is particularly well known, having seven different levels of completion/glitchiness on that one site alone. Exploration and glitch hunting are really all part of the fun.

If you *do* want to start arguing with other people, try to figure out what constitutes cheating to them. Build up from small things like faster text in a foreign version and save-and-quit for faster travel (or even [arm pumping in Super Metroid](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Arm_pumping) for something really basic, ignoring any sequence breaking it can cause).

The reason is that a small amount of un(der)employment is endemic to market capitalism to depress wages for a competitive labour market and thus inhibit inflation. 

The wage gap will always continue to expand if there is no ceiling pressure to match the floor. Establishing a minimum wage without any drag on top only builds half a bridge.

I'm not necessarily advocating a maximum wage, but merely stating what is a politically obvious if we look honestly at the question of the widening wealth gap."

If we continue to inflict damage on the environment, then we're going to have to increase the resources needed to deal with the changing climate.

Also more immediately is the notion of a run away green house effect.

firead,RealEstate,1389929119.0,"Mainly, it's because many of them just put the property on the MLS and that's it. Working with  flat-fee agency can be a lot like working with a FSBO at times, meaning that the buyer agent ends up having to doublecheck or handle the paperwork for both parties and that the seller may not fully understand parts of the contract or the closing process.

The owner can pick up some of the responsibilities, with varying degrees of success. Some will use a lawyer to prepare or check the paperwork for them, but most won't, because they usually use a flat fee service to save money and don't want to pay an attorney (in states where most real estate transactions do not involve one).

The owner can have a broker's open. They might not get as much of a reposne because they are not known to the local agents and probably don't have access to the local MLS or real estate board's contact list, but they could set a date and mail or email invites to local agents. If they do, they should be prepared for a lot of agents trying to convince them to list with them, and some people don't want that aggravation. "

Maldevinine,mining,1389929459.0,"I've got some stuff for you, but it is all from Australia. I'll try and keep it generic so you can look for the local equivalents. Both are commonwealth countries so it should be close enough.

Mining interacts with the law in 3 places. Health and Safety, Property Ownership and Resources Ownership. It still has to deal with legal issues in other areas, but those are the three which mining has specific laws. The first thing you need to confirm is what level of government is responsible for each of those areas. Also watch out because for many areas we have a ""mines"" act and a ""mining"" act. One's for coal and the other is for hard rock/metal.

Health and Safety in Australia is a huge job, and is State regulated while being pretty similar nationally. Mining has to deal with all the normal work for being a highly dangerous industry (supply PPE, provable actions at the top levels, extensive training etc) as well as having specific reporting requirements for incidents. You'll get to be good friends with government departments with names like ""Department of Primary Industries"". There will also be a lot of regulation around storage and handling of dangerous chemicals. We use hundreds of tons of explosives and the milling side has a whole collection of toxic, poisonous or flammable reagents.

Property Ownership is my area of specialty as a mine surveyor. Skipping the fun technically stuff a mine needs at least 2 forms of ownership of the land that they work. Firstly they need right of access, usually acquired by owning the title to the land in fee simple (quick check, do you use the Torrens Title system for land? If not the wording changes and everything becomes messier) and they need a right to extract minerals. This second one usually comes from a mining lease which is issued by the state government. All of those will have pages of conditions, generally to do with environmental and social impacts of the mine and minimizing them. Then while the mine is operational there will be endless reporting of the activities, my specific task is to produce 3 monthly maps of the workings both surface and underground to be stored by the DPI incase of closure of the mine.

Resource Ownership is the one I understand least because I have the least interaction with it. Basically anything in the ground is the property of the State government and you need to pay them by volume of what you extract/produce. I'm sure somebody has to deal with that, but it's not me."

I haven't really jammed with other people, using jam in the most literal sense of the word. I'm not a musician that can intuitively riff and noodle, even with multiple years of music theory classes. I have to practice something well in advance to incorporate it into a progression or song. I never put the time in to fully learning the scales on my guitar, but as I type this I'm thinking it's something that I really should do.

I mostly play on my acoustic and stick to learning DMB songs because of his unique approach to the instrument, but I play all kinds of stuff in the alternative rock spectrum.

Ingmundar,WinMyArgument,1389930812.0,"Firstly, you have to separate the issue of evolution and religious beliefs. There are many religious believers (Muslim, Christian, Jewish, etc.) who accept evolution as perfectly valid and continue to believe in God. I'm going to suggest that you argue for evolution from a view that isn't completely secular. 

Start under the preposition that evolution is a natural wonder, it is an amazing and dynamic process. It is clever and allows for species to adapt and survive. It's ingenious and could be a work of God, it could be a process guided by God even. But the fact of the matter is that whether it occurs or does not is no longer up for dispute. Why?

1) We have seen microorganisms evolve. Obviously, it's difficult for us to observe evolution in mammals like ourselves because they live for a long time. But bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protists evolve all of the time and we see it. It's why some bacterial strains can become immune to antibiotics. It's why new diseases can arise. It's why we need a new flu vaccine every year. It's indisputable that this happens and the mechanisms that we observe causing this, can happen in any other species to since every organism uses DNA. A similar set of rules applies between all of the kingdoms of life.

2) Vestigial structures make no sense if we were designed explicitly by God. Why do I have a tailbone? Why do the blood vessels in my eyes run over top of my retina and not behind it? Why do whales have hip bones? None of this makes any sense unless we understand that species evolve.

3) Why do I have &gt;97% of my DNA in common with a chimp? Why is 50% of it in common with a banana? Was God just lazy making us, or does it make more sense that there was a gradual transition between chimps and humans over the course of a few million years? 

4) Mutations are evident in even the human population. Let's say that hypothetically all humans came from a man and a woman in the Garden of Eden - where did all the races come from? If it were originally just one line of people, then at some point there had to be mutations or you'd expect all people to be the same race. Obviously, we're not different species but it appears that humans accumulated mutations that made living in certain regions of the world easier. 

The other thing you should do is clear up some things. Mainly that evolution isn't a set of discrete steps. It doesn't look anything like that the picture of the monkey going to a man in six steps. Evolution really looks like nothing. It's a slow transition and it's hard to decide when a new species exists because children look a lot like their parents, but not always like they great-great-great-great-grandparents. It also has to be understood that because some primates evolved to humans, it doesn't mean that all primates will. It's just that we accumulated mutations in a small community that slowly diverged. Chimps aren't our biological ancestors, modern chimps are our cousins. "

S-Flo,conspiratard,1389931212.0,"Not really possible. RFID is different from GPS, and couldn't be used to track anything over any substantial distance. The technology has a completely different set of intended applications and uses.

You can't really power the chip since you're injecting it into someone (and even if you did it would only have a range of a few dozen meters), so you'd have to use a battery-less variant. Those kind of RFID chips function though electrical induction, so you'd have to put a source of electromagnetism right up next to it to be able to read data off it (and the range on this thing is even smaller).

The only use of implanted RFID chips I can think of would be identifying bodies (you could pull an ID number off of the chip if there weren't any dog tags).

Interestingly enough, this is how some retail stores detect shoplifters. They place little slips of paper with chips on them like [this](http://i.imgur.com/NK7mb0p.jpg) into or on products (or hidden behind tags). Devices near the door emit eletromagnetic radiation which then induce a current in the chip, causing it to faintly transmit whatever data is stored within it.

juped,Catholicism,1389931254.0,"To be fair to the man Calvin, it's a bit of a caricature of his (heretical, I must stress) theology, but when someone in a Catholic context says ""Calvinism"", they generally refer to the doctrines surrounding election and salvation. These hold that God, for ineffable reasons, chose exactly a certain subset of humanity for salvation, which they cannot reject, and which the non-elect cannot accept.

This doctrine repels many because it implies that God is exactly the kind of petty tyrant that the linked post makes Him out to be. I find it easily refuted just by asking why Christ spent so much of his limited time on Earth on moral instruction if we don't have the need or even ability to choose to live morally.

Statements like this:
&gt;That means that fifty billion people are burning for the illusion of choice, so that his ""praises"" are a little more convincing.
&gt;He created, and doomed, a sentient species just to get an ego boost. How could I justify following someone who seemed so needy and petty?

seem to me to presuppose this kind of theology.

Catholics really do have reasonable answers to all these kind of things. You can make the argument that the Church has just been around for long enough to have come up with reasonable-sounding sophistries if you like - ultimately, faith isn't based on the strength of apologetics. But there's plenty of good apologetics to go around, and they're the obvious place to start."

gazork_chumble_spuzz,Christianity,1389931452.0,"&gt;The Question
&gt;
&gt;2 Peter 3:11b - “...what sort of persons ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness [?]”
&gt;
&gt;Tying in my earlier question (asking, what indicates that the Law has changed?), I ask what shows that the Commandments do not still define right and wrong?

If you read the verses I sent you, you will find verses showing us that we do not need to be keepers of the OT law. It isn't that the moral laws are no longer valid; right and wrong are still right and wrong. But the law is about more than things like giving us guidelines for our sexual relationships and telling us not to lie. The law is *huge* - it gave the people not only a set of moral guidelines, but also a set of ceremonial and civil laws.

I could contrast this question with another question: where, in the New Testament, are Christians explicitly commanded to keep the Old Testament laws? Where are we told that we must live up to all the old commands as we follow Jesus, or else we are sinning?

&gt;Daniel 7:25 shows us the Little Horn himself thinks to change the times and the Law. 

That feels like a verse that is taken out of context; I don't see what this has to do with following the OT law at all. There is nothing to indicate that this ""horn"" Daniel is prophesying about is referring to the Mosaic law and not just the laws of whatever country he lives in.

&gt;Then, 2 Thessalonians 2:3 goes on, “let no man beguile you in any way: for it will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.”

Again, this is a prophecy concerning the end times, the days of the antichrist and the great tribulation...this has nothing to do with a discussion about whether we are bound to follow the OT law or not.

&gt;In particular, the Spirit knew that some would pervert Paul's words toward lawlessness, and gave to Peter to warn, in 2 Peter 3:15b -

Here's how that reads in the KJV:

""16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.""

It seems to me to be a warning against those who twist the Scripture to justify doing evil, much like white slave owners did in the days before the American Civil War. 

By stating that we don't need to keep the OT law, that is not advocating anyone to be ""lawless"". 

&gt;This is a key point to understand, before I get into the challenging parts of Paul's letters, is Amos 3:7, “Surely, the sovereign יהוה does nothing without first revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.”

Then the only parts of the Bible we need are the books of prophecy.

Where in the prophetic books did God say He was going to give Israel the law, or did He say that all people for all of time need to keep that law or they'd be living in sin?

&gt;After repeatedly describing the Law as everlasting, if it was going to somehow be discarded, would He not have sent the message to as single prophet?

But obviously the law *cannot* be everlasting. Jesus came and redeemed mankind, and now we no longer need the ceremonial laws regarding temple worship and sacrifices and offerings. Obviously, all of the law is not lasting.

&gt;What about the Messiah as prophet? Well, one of the most-abused verses on this topic is saying, “Christ fulfilled the Law” (of Matthew 5: 17b) as if this means “Christ ended the Law, so we should not obey it.”

Jesus did fulfill the law, by His death and resurrection. And when He preached the sermon on the mount, He changed everything. The focus of the law is all outward - following ordinances, doing this or that ritual or action. But Jesus changed *everything* when He put the focus on *inner righteousness*. He told the pharisees and scribes that if we love God with all our hearts, and love our neighbour as ourselves, we will fulfill the law. It wasn't that he made it so that we no longer need to do the right thing; it's just that He changed our focus from following a set of harsh do's and don't's that absolutely nobody ever was able to follow, to *being* righteous on the inside and allowing that inner righteousness to shape our actions and choices.

The law is no longer needed. We aren't made righteous by following it - we are made righteous because Jesus gives us of His own righteousness. He takes our sin, He clothes us in His grace and holiness, and HE is the source of our righteousness. We no longer need to follow the ceremonial laws to pay for our sins because Jesus did it. We don't need to live by the civil laws because we are expected (as per the writing of Paul) to adhere to the laws of the land in which we reside. And what we need to follow now for moral laws are the teachings of Jesus (which actually coincide fairly well with the OT moral laws). We don't need the OT law - it is repeatedly described in the New Testament as a curse and a burden and no longer needed because now we have Jesus and are under His grace.

anihilistlol,cscareerquestions,1389932184.0,"""All I had to do was to sort the words and then check if the strings were equal."" - This isn't even obvious at all, so I'm not sure why you're mad. Just because the concept is simple doesn't mean it's intuitive.

When I solved this problem, I just noticed that the count of different letters in two anagrams must always be the same. This reveals a linear time solution with a hash map. Counting letters then leads into the solution you gave: when you sort the letters, the same letters all appear next to each other so it's basically like counting them. Actually, it's equivalent to counting without compression (e.g. ""aaa"" is the same as a-&gt;3).

The solution you mentioned avoids the extra space of using a hash map by hopefully doing some kind of in place sort (if it's not in place like quick sort, your solution is poor because it will use O(n) memory space and have a suboptimal running time of o(nlogn))."
temp9876,BabyBumps,1389932191.0,"It's ok, you're certainly not alone!  I always wanted a daughter but I think this will be my third son.  I struggled with my last pregnancy, I really thought it was a girl and even after finding out the sex didn't really believe until he was born.

The great news is, sons are AWESOME.  I get to have little miniature versions of my favorite person in the whole world, my husband, and I am their favorite person in the whole world!  Mommy's boys are great, it's like Spock, have you seen the new Star Trek movies?  Spock LOVES his mommy, she's the one thing that will make him lose his cool, NO ONE talks bad about his mommy!  You get to be that to someone!

[Boys in suits](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/533173119_1/wholesale-5sets-lot-2012-new-arrival-cute-baby-boy-s-clothes-set-romper-vest-for-summer.jpg) are way, WAY cuter than I expected, poofy baby dresses don't even seem as interesting to me anymore.  We're planning to get dressed up and go to tea for mothers day this year and I cannot wait to have all my boys dressed up, they're so handsome!  And as they grow up and I bully them into being my little gentlemen once in a while it's enough to make me cry!

I worried about parenting a boy too, but it is easier than I thought it would be.  I think cleaning poop off of testicles is easier to figure out than cleaning up vulva, but not from experience.  There are tough issues to tackle, but having been through talks about touching yourself and sex and love and bodily fluids and body odors I don't think it is any worse than it would be with girls.  I can always make dad handle it if I really don't know what's going on or how to tackle it.  Basically the most important thing I've found is learning to A) tune out the noise and B) figure out how to determine which head injuries require a visit to the ER and which don't.  I'm pretty good at it.

Even right now, my husband is so protective of me, and my beautiful little boys are learning from him so they're being extra caring and wonderful, my prince charmings!  

Part of me will always be sad that I didn't get to have a little princess in my life, but I love my boys so very much that if this bean is a girl I will probably be a little disappointed."
ThatCrankyGuy,learnprogramming,1389932192.0,"First off a personal rant: QA are a bunch of no good useless whiny babies. Most of them are Engineers - yes professional engineers in structural/mechanical/materials who couldn't find employment in their own fields and so decided to use their prestigious titles to sit in comfy chairs doing nothing and signing off on projects. Nothing against engineers, I myself am an ECE. It's just that the jobs are easy, and the pay is good, and because QA folks have the ultimate responsibility of signing off on specs, and conducting user acceptance testing and singing off on virtually all deliverables, management prefers it if these chaps are professional engineers.

You really need a computer background to enter these sort of field, but who knows, if you're clever you could use your psychology background, take some Human Computer Interaction courses and take those in combination to your advantage when applying for QA jobs.

vorpalblab,AskMen,1389932283.0,"As a man who has had both parents die, and a brother, my feelings were difficult to describe.

One thing to realize is that in the 40's and 50's when I grew up, Real Men Don't Cry was a big part of what was normal for raising boys.

Second is that when I felt bad about the deaths, I had no really authentic way to express that grief. Because no practice through a lifetime of keeping up with the guys, manliness wise.

Also the conundrum of causing my SO psychic pain by showing my grief causes me to want to show stoicism.

The grief leaks out a bit at a time over the days and months following the funeral each time something happens and I would make that little tiny automatic mental note ""I gotta tell Mom about this when next I meet her - oh damn. . ""

When it is  an expected death with a gravely ill person - there is less of a shock and less immediate grief. Some of that bargaining and grieving takes place in advance and in the end it is almost a relief and denouement."

This influences our body, we will believe stupid irrational things and do things to others and ourselves because of them, and it will be very hard to stop when recognized.

Saying is sin is a in our DNA is bit dangerous. It implies we may one day edit our DNA to get rid of our sin nature. But no this impossible, because our sin nature exists beyond our tangible physical bio-code.

Saying it's in the mind makes one believe it possibly treatable with human intervention, chemicals and therapy, and behaviorual modification. This may lessen, but it will never rid..

benk4,nfl,1389932874.0,"&gt; You haven't named one ""higher probability"" scenario. Not a single one. At best you've argued it's the same probability which I also disagree with.

The article named several.  What if you end up with a 4th down in field goal range?  If you kicked you don't know if you'll need that extra score or not so you're forced to go for it.  Also what if you end up with the ball and 3 minutes to go?  Do you go hurry up or run your normal offense?  Both scenarios are much more likely than snapping the ball through the back of the endzone, or the minor, magical, supposed increased chance of a turnover that may or may not exist.

Also I'm glad you do seem to know what an appeal to authority is!  The only problem is that you have 2 requirements:  A) the people in source are legitimate experts, B) There exists a consensus on the subject.  

Neither of these 2 are met.  Football coaches are obviously seriously flawed at some finer points of game strategy in football.  They're constantly botching timeout timing and 4th down calls and are famously prone to playing in an overly conservative manner to protect their image/jobs.  

I've provided 2 people who have actually looked at the numbers, the game theory, and layed out the strategy that have agreed with me.  Have you provided any?  And you're going to claim there's an overwhelming consensus among experts?   Congrats on your fallacious appeal to authority.

&gt; Look. You're just wrong and you clearly think you are smarter than you are. A regular reddit genius whipping out all of these fallacy's and using them incorrectly.

ulvok_coven,AskHistorians,1389933635.0,"[This article might be enlightening - it refers particularly to French traders on the Mississippi.](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20174258)

&gt; The social reality on the ground was slow to change, and French settlements continued much as they had before - tied together by a commercial system of traders and merchants travelling the waterways of North America to form what was in essence a French river world.

He goes on to say that this continued into the 1830s, buoyed by fur trade from Saint Louis, and inevitably fur trade from Michillimackinac and Canada.

Interestingly, he makes a point I wrote a paper on for a university class - the French trade networks were similar to Native trade networks, often based largely on loose kinships (godparents, remarriage, babysitting) and had a pretty significant amount of mobility for women.

That aside, the situation of the southern French should actually be contrasted with Michillimackinac, a British fort after the Treaty of Paris. The French only lightly fortified it even though it was by far the most important trading post south of Montreal, even moreso than the Sault. There was a large trade community there formed almost entirely of meti (half-Indians, children or grandchildren of French traders). By comparison, the British more than tripled the garrison, erected heavy fortifications, and eventually removed the previous population there for fear of the Indians - Indians who would actually storm the fort during Pontiac's War, having convinced the British to join them in a game of lacrosse just outside the gates.

The French really did not remain where the British were, especially with the removal of the Jesuits. Many Indians who had been Christianized continued with their uniquely hybrid faith, even after being displaced by Americans. And the meti/French trading community thrived, as did that of more southern reaches. There's a reason that Lousiana today has so many Cajuns and Creoles - because the French never left, they just became the new Indians."

I suggested to her that it would be a fair rule of thumb for me to spend 3x what she did (on joint relationship activities, like a weekend getaway). She was pretty uncomfortable with that, as she felt like she wasn't pulling her weight, and in the end we settled on a 2x multiplier as being reasonable.

My current SO (as of a couple weeks ago, I suppose I should be calling her my fiancée :D ) earns a little more than I do, but we both earn enough that it's basically a rounding error in terms of spending power. We try to spend the same amount, sometimes by splitting bills (e.g. airfare and hotels), other times by taking turns (e.g. paying for meals).

She does, however, have significantly more savings than I do. We've talked it over extensively and are both okay with the idea that, when we decide to buy a home, she'll be handling the majority of the down payment.

herps,europe,1389934518.0,"&gt;I am not saying it's not useful, it is when you have air superiority and don't have to worry about s-300's

&gt; Stealth is a gimmick, there is no such thing in The real world

That's pretty much what you were saying.


The point of stealth is to reduce the effectiveness of an enemies radar.  Against air units your reduce the range of their sensors allowing you to see them first and get the first shot in.  Getting the first shot in on a non-stealth Eurofighter before it knows your there is a huge advantage in a dogfight  

Stealth against ground units not only reduces the range of their radar but also forces them to run their radar longer giving your air to ground units a chance to detect and take out those installations.  Ground to air missiles wont work unless you have active radar installations.  

The Russians and Chinese have seen this when we have gone up against proxy 3rd world powers, or as you so racistly put it the ""durkabanistanis"" of this world.  They've seen our capability and they are willing to spend billions of their dollars trying to steal or duplicate it in their next gen aircraft.

solo_sysygy,AdviceAnimals,1389934996.0,"Backstory: I was driving to work on a foggy morning in my white car, when a woman pulled out from a cross street and T-boned me.  Fortunately I was okay, but my car was totaled. The driver (who I later learned was a woman taking her daughter to school) did not stop, and actually kept on driving to the school with a blown tire. 

It was her fault, but I realized later than had I turned my lights on, it might have prevented the accident.  (My reasoning at the time was that headlights in the fog can create glare, but this is mostly just the case when you use your highbeams.)  

Even if you can see great in fog or dim light, turn your headlights on anyway.  There are other drivers who cannot see very well--and in fact, probably shouldn't be driving--and you want to do everything you can to stop them from pulling out in front of you.  Even if the accident is their fault, that's small consolation when your car is wrecked, or if you get hurt or killed."

They were lightly armored and very, very fast, with several horses a piece, and the Mongolians were sometimes said to use human shields to reduce their own risk. Another very simple yet devastating move was to attack ferociously with skirmishers, but then have them rout - when enemies moved to pursue the retreating Mongols, they were flanked and obliterated by heavier cavalry and archers. They would herd enemy troops like animals - something they did all year round, horses and goats and sheep and yaks. And they used siege bombardment in open fields, which they had recruited/stolen from China. No one could match an army that moved very, very fast and fought mostly at long range.

On the stability of the empire: raoul is right, Mongol retribution was brutal. But it's much more than that. The Mongols established a post service, called the *yam,* with riders trading horses frequently to transition messages as rapidly as possible across the Empire. The roads were said to be extremely safe under Mongol rule, and they needed to be, because East-West trade was their lifeblood, the only way they could hope to not only sustain the army, but to keep the rival political families in check. Which brings us to the structure of Mongol governance - the uppermost echelons were family and friends of Chingis, that was true. But a lowly steppe conqueror didn't have political friends or political debts, his commanders were the very best, and held to extremely high standards. The new khan was *elected* by the aristocracy of the Empire, and was always supposed to be the very best leader. The khagan and royal family didn't micromanage the Empire, though - they mostly appointed local proxies. And by appointed, I mean (in Russia, at least) the proxy had to be approved by the local Mongolian power broker, in person, and disapproval was sometimes synonymous with execution. Moscow's prominence today is entirely because Mongol tax collectors decided they like the tune of the Muscovy princes more than others.

The Empire was massive, but it communicated, and local power answered - in blood - to Mongol oversight. The Empire wanted its treasure to flow, and it accomplished that.

However, it collapsed under internal ambition. When politics infected the royal family, and threats of assassination appeared, the *kuruldai* election system fell into disarray, leading to a blood conflict with each family for themselves. Kublai Khan gets to call himself khagan for two reasons - first, most of the local Mongol rulers paid obeisance to him, and second, because he controlled Mongolia. But the Empire, in the European sense, was over before he consolidated power. Batu's Horde and the Middle Eastern khanates were really independent powers."

Maldevinine,australia,1389936144.0,"I am not sure that the Greens understand the culture behind hunting. In the article they are repeatedly described as ""amateurs"" but anyone who is willing to go hunting is going to be near professional in skill.

Firstly, they don't just hand guns to anybody. You need to prove either ownership of sufficient land or membership of a gun club to get your licence. Once you own one you're going to join a club anyway so you have somewhere to use it. And at that point, it becomes a sport. You practice, you compete and you learn from others to improve your skills. Any licenced gun owner is going to be reasonably accurate with their weapon.

The majority of hunters come from rural areas anyway, and hunt locally. They know their forests, their prey and their weapon. They'll know other hunters in the area and swap stories and tips. There will most likely be a social club in the area that they are all members of which will have competitions and help to organise events.

The kind of person who is going to go pest control hunting in state forests is going to be good at it. There's too much cost in the activity to not be good at it. Accidents will happen and there needs to be separation between hunting and other activities, but there is no reason to cease hunting in those areas.

Things like this really sadden me, because if both sides could just see past their knee-jerk reactions to each other, the Shooters and Fishers and the Greens could be very strong political allies. They are the two groups who care the most about the environment."

The relevant bits are near the end, where he discusses how and why the thrulls dominate all of sarpadia. If the Thrulls had a visionary figure who would lead them they would be unstoppable.

Even more importantly we have legendary Vorthos chow involving a mysterious tale of Sahr's Thrulls impressing the Phyrexians.

bigtcm,AskReddit,1389937575.0,"TL, DR: The novel below describes how I believe my mother is the sole reason why her three children are rather inexperienced in relationships.

My mother pretty much banned us from interacting with the opposite gender growing up. I didn't go to any high school dances. I was a shy awkward kid in high school. When we finally moved out to go to college, her philosophy instantly flipped 180 - suddenly we had to quickly find a wife/husband to marry and pop out kids. I can't speak for my brother (more on this at the very end), but I know that my sister and I received numerous phone calls on a weekly basis from my mother, talking shit to us.

**No that is not an exaggeration. She'd call us, not to give advice, but to talk shit.**

She'd call us and recall how easy it was for her to get boys all the time and how they'd chase her home. She'd giggle and tell us stories about how her professor asked her to stay after class and wonder what was wrong with us. She'd tell us how it was a waste that she gave birth to such beautiful kids and how none of us were interested in pursuing a relationship. We tried explaining how we didn't know what we were doing and she would have none of it.

In college, I discovered that I was a pretty social person and people liked me. I made loads of friends and had tons of fun. It's not too surprising to find out then, that, I got myself a girlfriend during my 2nd year of college. My mother was so happy. She was so proud that all the ""advice"" she had been giving me for the last year and a half wasn't all for naught.

And my mother was LIVID when we broke up two years later. She would call me up, ask me questions, and proceed to completely tune out my answers. She thought I was some douchebag and that I mistreated my ex. I ended up calling up my ex, apologizing to her for doing this in advance, and then sticking her on the phone to tell my mom that I was an alright guy. My mother would also chat with my ex's mom over weekly sessions of coffee, and the two of them would just agree that I was a terrible guy. I just stopped picking up her phone calls because I realized that my sanity was slowly waning. Eventually my dad would call me to ask about something completely unrelated, and then my mom would ask to use the phone. She'd make small talk for about five minutes and as soon as she asked about dating or my ex, I'd hang up.

A decade now has passed since all that drama. My ex and I are the best of friends. Things with my mother and me are better now as well; my mother knows not stick her nose in my relationship business anymore. The ex's mother has also apologized to me. I'm now her surrogate nephew/son.

There are several other scattered stories here and there, but it's been much calmer with my mom since that first girlfriend:

* My mother presented me my dead grandmother's wedding ring when I brought over another girl home for Thanksgiving dinner. I had been dating this girl for a month.

* My mother called up her ailing father in Asia so he could help ""convince me"" not to go back to school and to hurry up and give him great grand kids. 

But overall, she's calmed way down. I think she's realized that giving us shit is not going to do anything to help ""motivate us"" to get married.

So that brings us to present day.

I'm currently a single, 30 year old man who has had 3 serious relationships in his entire life. I have many friends who are girls, but few, if any, romantic interests. When asked about my relationships now, I'll just tell my mother that I'm gay. Or that I'm dating a black woman (My mom's biggest fear - me dating a black woman. I'm not kidding). I'm polite to my mother (I mean, she did give birth to me), but I don't really take her advice to heart. I think she's finally started to realize that I'm not really going to take her ""advice"" to heart, so she's stopped hassling me for the most part.

My sister is 28 and has never been kissed, never had a relationship, hell, I don't think she's even held hands with a boy yet. My mother is most concerned about her getting married because apparently my sister is ""getting old and unmarriageable"". It's not surprising then to know that I can't remember the last time the two of them had a conversation that didn't end in a screaming match. My mother will ALWAYS bring up how my sister needs to find a husband and my sister will straight up tell my mother that it's HER fault that she isn't married already...which soon devolves into the aforementioned screaming match.

My brother fell completely off the map. We know where he lives. We know what he does for a living, and that's about it. You could tell me that my brother pimps crack ho's and has sired ten illegitimate children, and I wouldn't be too shocked. My mother is afraid to ask my brother what's going on, so she'll ask me to ask him for updates. I always flatly refuse: ""Mom, I really don't care what he's doing, as long as he's staying out of trouble. If you really want to know what's going on, why not ask him yourself? He's your son"". I think she might be afraid of the truth."

I've found that

2) you may need to use a setting lotion (don't necessarily go out and buy lottaboddy or make the linseed oil setting lotion just yet, but there are plenty of around-the-house formulations you can try, like aloe or castor oil)

3) a wet set may work better than a dry set

4) you might need to wear a headscarf or a hat, especially if you're going to be sleeping on them.

5) [Sculptural pin curls](http://www.vintagehair.com/blog/blog1.php/how-to-make-a-vintage-sculpture-pin-curl) are fantastic.

But really, cards engineered for only something like EDH (huge splashy effect, high cost) are really bland and boring. The Primordial cycle is a great example of this; they go in pretty much any EDH deck and don't require thought or synergy. They just synergize with the whole format. 

What does winning with Rise of the Dark Realms or Omniscience really show? That you can win long multiplayer games with single cards? You managed to hit 9 or 10 mana?

The Watchtower Society is neither demon nor saint, but they support secularism and have engaged in their share of court cases to that end. It is a religion and what you are vilifying is mainly them actually adhering to what they believe instead of hypocritically stating one belief and acting the opposite. 

This is the corner you would wedge them into. If they do not act in accord with their beliefs, then you can assail them as hypocrites. If they do, you assail them as brainwashed sheep. This is not a sensible position."

Amazing really, considering iso ran the whole thing from home.

If you wanna give credit were credit is due, iso made a dominion online that was way better without any of the garbage that goko puts on there. But he did it for free to get interest in a great game.

Donald went to someone that told him they could give him profits. Dx deserves to get paid. I bought all the expansions. But I won't buy them again online.

Fuck that. Fuck D.X for getting greedy. And Fuck goko for sucking so bad at what they were paid to do and driving off everyone from iso and away from dominion.

Iso did better work for free in his spare time. He got more people involved in dominion than the cards did. Where's his reward for all that work? For his dedication and passion? Those are two things goko has no concept of. They just know about how to do the minimum to make the marks pay up.

I wouldn't take your appeal, either.  It's simply a waste of your time if you don't have proper medical documentation.  If you're like most people, when you have ""6 non-incapacitating episodes in the past 12 months,"" you don't bother with the doctor, you grab a shitload of Mucinex from your local pharmacy.  Why would anybody waste time and money going to a clinic when they're just going to prescribe generic over-the-counter shit?  Unfortunately, the VA cannot take your word for it.  The rating board needs to see medical records documenting each ""episode,"" no matter how trivial.  In the military, we learned to avoid sick call to stay off the shitlist.  You're not in the military anymore.  Go see the doc whenever you have a runny nose.  

Also, I wouldn't bother with lawyers.  You're much better off with a Veterans Service Officer representing you.  The DAV, American Legion, VFW, AMVETS, etc., are located in your local regional office, and their services are free to all Veterans.  Use them.  They are Veterans just like you.

Daiteach,studyroomf,1389940832.0,"I agree. I felt like a lot of the jokes were pretty funny, but Troy's reason for leaving doesn't feel like a culmination of anything. I don't feel like it utterly betrays who Troy is as a character or anything like that, but I guess I expected more from Community. (Although it does have another episode to deal with it.) If I didn't know that Glover was leaving the show, I would assume that of *course* the character wasn't actually going to leave, since the reasoning behind it feels pretty thin. It's like when a show with a long-running destined-couple brings in a big-name guest star to be a rival love interest for one of them. You *know* that they're not actually going to end up with that person. Except Troy is actually going on a boat, unless they pull another switch in episode five. Community is just normally so beautifully structured that something like Troy on a Boat as the end of the character's arc feels like ""this is just the first thing we thought of, we'll write in a real idea later"" by comparison.

I thought the rest of the episode was good but not great. It's material and a premise that the show has mined before, and with situations that felt more human. (In particular, that Annie drugged the rest of the group without their knowledge feels hard to brush off as just another thing; that's definitely a new level of darkness for the character.) The escalating revelation of secrets tearing the group apart until Jeff talks them back together and Pierce screwing with the group via bequeathment aren't new things for the series, and the episode felt like a retread, not a great new use of those themes.

Also, I don't know how I feel about Pierce's cause of death being an incredibly cartoony and morbid gross-out joke. The character only gets to have one cause of death, and I don't know that having something that unreal be the punctuation on the character is something that I really like all that much."

He shouldn't be offended. You can offer, and you can always go dutch if anything.

flclreddit,mtgcube,1389942515.0,"At 540, it sounds like a really bad idea to try pushing tribal builds unless it is extremely dedicated. Think of it this way: you only see a fraction of the cards that you draft 540 with unless you play a full 12 person draft. The chances of running into these narrow merfolk is small. Then, in order for those cards to be decent, you need a high concentration of them so that you can draw them often. Again, there is a poor probability of even seeing the cornerstone tribal cards that are necessary for the dedicated deck to work, at 1 copy of each in a 40 card deck.

Cursecatcher, Master of Waves, and Master of the Pearl Trident all seems very lackluster. I'd rather be playing other blue spells myself. Why play Cursecatcher when I could be playing Force Spike? etc etc

U doesn't usually like to play aggro creatures. B can get by a little bit more because tossing Gary into a deck with Bloodghast, Nantuko Shade, Geralf's Messenger, Hypnotic Specter, Phyrexian Obliterator etc already feels natural.

crashonthebeat,worldbuilding,1389942646.0,"So, a bit more information about what you see. Here's what I've fleshed out so far.

Taern and Bael - Elvish Republics. Taern is quite a bit more conservative and natury than the Cosmopolitan-leaning elves. Taern is also the home of a bunch of primitivist wood-elves.

Sylhain Federation - The remains of a once-mighty empire after a series of rebellions and a war with Taern. The war forced them into a democracy, and the loss of almost half their territory, including the Kingdoms of Laukrey and Zyordan.

Narregar Kingdom - The Narregar are a race of half-elf-half-orcs. Despite their heritage, they are industrious, resourceful and refined as a culture. 

Ossitel - On the surface, a small dominion of Dwarven lands. Underneath the mountains is a vast network of dwarven caves and tunnels and mines and stuff. 

Fraehan Empire (Thuus, Vasnorach, Rheisse, Vierregar, Zaxaun, Nercoth, Bavburg, Arahaem, Wudreme, West Afval) - This is basically like the Holy Roman Empire. A succession crisis threw a Kingdom into disarray, and they reorganized into an elective monarchy with semi-independent states.

Thuus - Largest city in the world. Center of trade and majesty, as well as the capital of the Fraehan Empire.

Arahaem - A religious city (basically Vatican City) built around the site where Aramor, god of men, ascended to godhood.

jonesybear,baseball,1389943565.0,"Technically everything in the MLB has always been ""judgement calls"". I will say I'm a bit of a purist and love the human factor of umpires calling what they see, even if it's wrong. The thing is most teams/fans see a close call as in their favor, whether it is or not. For over 100 years the umps have been trained to do the best they can. No, they aren't perfect, and I hate Angel Hernandez because he likes to see things that aren't there, but I don't care because calls go against a team and calls go for a team. The technology is there so why even have umps with it? They are implementing the reviews with, all but basically proximity plays. possibly trapped balls, and strikes and balls. Why not get rid of all but one umpire that calls balls and strikes. He can decide if it's a proximity play for a DP at 2nd as well. I hate the fact that fans of teams that have bad calls, like even the Braves against the Cards with the total crap infield fly call, have a sudden outcry about this. The calls go both ways. You win some and you lose some. It's about making the best of the situation you have. That's what baseball has always been about. Not the umpires making mistakes, which they do because they're human. It's about capitalizing on any little chance you get. If you get rid of the human aspect of umpiring, you get rid of a lot of chances for that. Which very well could make the game more boring to many people through spending time reviewing plays. Everyone is human and makes mistakes. Ballplayers are trained to be the best they can be and they make mistakes. Why are we such assholes about umpires when at least some of their mistakes can help our team and we cheer like hell about it? It's really hypocritical. Let the umps do their thing. They're trained for it."

Reddit_SuckLeperCock,perth,1389943675.0,"I don't agree with the cull either, it's an over-reaction to a virtually non-existent problem. 

However I think what people forget is that fisherman do this every single day up and down the coast for recreation, killing thousands every year. You're allowed to kill 3 per day per person legally, excluding the 4 protected species (grey nurse, whites, whale and speartooth). I'm on a lot of fishing forums and every day there are pictures of sharks that have been caught and killed - for fun and eating. Anything from tigers to bulls to shovel-nose to reef sharks and gummies and everything in-between. And this isn't including the commercial fishers who obviously take a lot more (legally). The effect of this cull on the shark population will be negligable, save for 1 or 2 less great whites swimming around because they're the only 'danger' sharks to get over 3 metres in length that the cull is targeting that recreational fishers can't kill. Big tigers (the other 'danger' sharks) are killed legally all the time for recreation yet no-one bats an eyelid. The government says they're going to do it (on a far smaller scale than recreational fisherman) and all hell breaks loose? 

Like I said I don't agree with the cull, we should leave them alone and it's not the governments place to be killing sharks in reaction to the blatant fear-mongering the media's drummed up about this bullshit, but just remember this 'cull' is just a drop in the ocean compared to what civilians are legally allowed to do on a daily basis anyway.

Edit - I should add that there is a size limit for recreational fishing due to over-fishing of big sharks. Anything around 2.5 metres + should be 'released' but often the sharks are too badly injured by swallowing hooks, or they're out of the water too long to survive anyway. "

It takes advantage of limitations in how we perceive audio (we're much less likely to detect a quiet sound if it immediately follows a loud sound, for example). As a result, it simplifies the pieces we won't hear as well and saves an awful lot of space in the process.

The same basic principle of optimizing for perception is used in JPEG compression (similar areas of color, say, the blue sky, are generalized in the mind so we can focus on things with more detail, like birds). JPEG compresses the bits we're not paying attention to the most. In the end, a high quality JPEG appears virtually identical to the original pixels, but the act of optimizing for our perception of it reduces the filesize dramatically."

My stance has now changed quite a bit though. One thing that made me think it's a women's rights issue is that there are several things women can do that are much less safe than abortion that can also lead to the fetus dying. Starving themselves, being in hostile environments, other such things. I know it's a big step, but if you slippery-slope this idea you basically put women in a scenario where, once they become pregnant, they are immediately told exactly what they can/cannot eat, drink, do, etc. The way I see it to avoid this is to say they should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, including abortion.

And remember this: ""It is not about life or death. It is about what breaks first: Your will or the barriers in your way.""

You will die many times in this game. Many many times. But it is part of the experience. Do not give up."

E.G. your telco may charge 20c per text message, the actual cost of wear and tear on their systems would be much lower than that (think 0.00000001c) but the market demands a price to be set otherwise competition would be all kinds of fucked up.

Often they use studies that look at the absolute benefits of the grain, but look at it in a vacuum (non-human testing and chemical composition), from that you can get results like (made up example) 'bobgrain' which is made of 25% fiber and 62% protein. In absolute terms this sounds great, but if it isn't digestible by humans then it's completely useless as a nutritional source. 

But if 'bobgrain' didn't do harm to humans (just gets pooped out) then it can be added to bread and the bread is sold claiming the nutritional facts of 'bobgrain' (which are true,) but doesn't tell you that 'bobgrain' won't do anything for you, thus it doesn't trigger market regulations."

Avistew,writing,1389949058.0,"Well, fantasy or sci-fi is a setting. Then there are genres, such as adventure, or spy story, etc, that are not conducive to a long-term relationship. On the other hand you also have, say, fantasy romance, which obviously involves relationships. So it just seems to me that whether the story is fantasy, sci-fi, historical or modern, that doesn't really tell us if there is going to be romance in it or not. That's not about the setting but the genre (romance, comedy, adventure, thriller, mystery, slice of life, etc).

So when you comment that deep emotional relations are not common in fantasy, I just think that maybe all the fantasy you read is about adventure, like, say, the Hobbit, but there is definitely a whole lot of fantasy stories that have deep emotional relations in them."

Basically yes, men aren't objectified in the same way women are, because women aren't attracted to men in the same way men are attracted to women.  Men don't care/complain when they're objectified sexually because there's no evolutionary cost to it.  While women feel uneasy because there is a very high cost to it (getting raped by a low value mate).

Men are objectified in other ways, mainly having to do with resources.  I forget which comedian said it, but women don't like a man in uniform, they like a man with a job.  Some of the most common ways men are objectified are through signals of value.  Sharp suits, military uniforms, dudes greased up and working in the back yard.

sunglasses619,BPD,1389949591.0,"OK, I have had the same problem and I haven't fixed it so I can't offer you a solution. But I am working through it.

With help, I have identified two major causes of this: 1. emotional instability. 2. fear/dislike of self.

1. Emotional instability: You might feel like you're fine and all of this is happening. But you are probably getting more much upset or angry than others during these times of people 'not talking' to you. With me, it felt like everyone had ignored me and didn't care about me, and I was devastated. I have had other friends and noticed that at times when I would be very upset or blame myself, they are only a bit upset and do not let it affect their self-image or discourage them. They just get on with their lives.

2. Fear/dislike of self: BPD individuals often try so hard to find an identity because they fear what they will find if they truly see themselves. They think that underneath it they are bad or evil or unlovable. I think sometimes that fear comes across to other people and it makes them uncomfortable. The fear of what is inside you does not reflect reality, but it is a symptom of BPD. 

I hope this helps, and good luck with everything. Until you make more progress with this problem, getting more involved with things you like doing will help. I started working out every day and working at a gallery alongside my classes -- you become much less sensitive when you have a busy schedule.

If it was that important to someone that you never eat a banana, and you agreed not to do it, then did it anyway, they'd be 100% right to be pissed at you, and you'd be completely in the wrong. It would be on you to either not make the promise in the first place and explaining that you find it unreasonable, keep the promise you made, or tell them that the promise is becoming to hard to keep and you want to talk about it and decide together what to do (break up, agree you can eat a banana once in a while, find other fruit that's fine to eat, whatever).

Yes, someone who refuses to let you eat bananas is being too controlling, but it's on you to tell them so and refuse to date them or refuse to go along with their restrictions. Agreeing and then betraying their trust is a shitty thing to do. Just because you think it's silly and unimportant does not mean you're allowed to treat it as such when it's obvious it's not the case for them."

What they really should do is make a whitelist of ""verified"" sites that they know aren't fishy, and not give a warning on links using that domain. Also, if a specific link is reported as a phishing link, they could make the user go through another check that states something like ""this site has been reported as a phishing site, are you sure you want to proceed?"" with a check box."

I just try really hard to focus on my schedule and to have other things going on -- which is REALLY hard when you only care about other people and don't have personal goals, but seriously try to be working toward something. Even if it's only working out to look better, that can become part of your schedule. Taking a shower, or getting a coffee. Or therapy -- and this has been hard for me when I've been really bad because I feel like they don't care and whatever else. Groups are better for this.

Just try to structure your own schedule and manage the panic, anxiety and loneliness with group therapy and family contact (if that's an option). I know how hard that is, but it is possible to make it better. Good luck!"

JAWJAWBINX,changemyview,1389950500.0,"First and foremost autistic individuals actually have a different neurological structure than NTs. The autistic brain has areas of considerably higher connectivity and has different pathways which cause the brain to function differently at a rather fundamental level. Things have changed a lot since you were diagnosed. Back then the assumption was that the autistic were inherently worse with no real reason beyond simply behaving differently. Now people are realizing that the autistic mind isn't inferior but simply different, a lot of psychologists don't care about knowing more than they need to diagnose people so they're going off the same information that the general public is, even when it was new that info was wrong. Put simply those who believe themselves to be worse because they are autistic instead of simply being different and needing to learn to pass (though that is entirely a cultural thing which may change in the future) do so because they aren't told otherwise and have low enough self-esteem that they will believe what others say about them. Essentially some people will use labels (even labels like socially inept) to avoid having to actually work and improve and others will always make those who are designated ""other"" in some fashion feel worse to trick themselves into thinking they're superior."

racistsfuckoff,socialism,1389950675.0,"No, I don't have control over where the products I purchase are produced. I am not the capitalist. I am forced to buy the cheapest thing because of my low income. Even if I wasn't, the consumer has no say over the location of the factory, the conditions of the workers, and the pay received by the workers. Even when capitalists ""change"" their practices in accordance with consumer demand, they don't really change their practice, they change their branding. Look at fair trade, or free range eggs for good examples.

Worker's don't have a personal responsibility to choose a product which is branded as being more ethical. This is making the worker responsible for the exploitation carried out by the capitalist. The only fuckers responsible for child labour, union busting, unfair wages, etc, are the fuckers *doing it*, not the consumer. They didn't start using child labour because the consumer demanded child labour, they started doing it because it maximises their profits, and consumer boycotts themselves just do not have an impact on profits.

Sometimes the publicity generated by a boycott can have a positive impact, but making an ""ethical choice"" does not. A good example would be the boycotts of South Africa or Israel. Boycotting a rugby team or Sodastream has no hope of ending apartheid, but it can keep the issue in people's consciousness.

A boycott can be a small part of a larger strategy, but it's never the responsibility of an exploited person to buy from one capitalist or another. Personal responsibility is the language of liberalism."

When I turned 30, my goal was to seriously chase a dream, just for me. I am.

Every single person who criticizes me has never made a single video of their own. So, I don't worry about it. If I keep at it, I will earn that $100. I won't be rich, but I will have achieved my goal of making a little money doing something I love. It's more than my critics have done. Plus, you never know... maybe the right video at the right time will give me a huge traffic spike and things could take off.

What's that you say? She doesn't? Yup, there are very few direct quotes, but the crux is:

&gt; China is also able to implement policies because its political system avoids some of the legislative hurdles seen in countries including the U.S., Figueres said.

[...]

&gt; The political divide in the U.S. Congress has slowed efforts to pass climate legislation and is “very detrimental” to the fight against global warming, she said.

She makes no value declaration about communism, and states obvious facts about the difference between political systems.

When you're poor, or even doing just okay, money controls you. Anything that you might need to spend money on unexpectedly is a liability, because you might not have enough to make rent. In this mindset, it's crucial to survival that you minimize your spending, especially unpredictable and potentially urgent spending like car repairs. When I was poor (until I was 18ish, 2 years of which I was financially independent) I learned to do most everything for myself because if I had to pay someone to do it for me, I became way less financially stable, which made me feel immature. 

When you have much more money than you actually need to live on, this isn't an issue. Oh, you need to find a new apartment unexpectedly and there's a security deposit and more space than you're used to? No worries, you'll pay that and then go to the furniture store. Laptop dies? Guess you'll have to budget some time to run to Best Buy. Car needs new tires? Darn, that $500 is going to cut into my shopping/restaurant budget this month. Friend wants to take a spontaneous weekend vacation to a city 400 miles away? Sure, but I already bought a TV earlier this month so I shouldn't go _too_ crazy on shopping while I'm there.

Lots of laws apply. 
Sort of public domain.

I understand what you mean, and it's all a matter of common sense, really. Freedom ends where other freedoms begin. However, in this case, I think it would probably fly, at least within spanish borders. Not sure about the rest of countries in Europe.

Nudity is actually legal within Spain, even in public domain, as long as there is not a sexual connotation to it, and there needs to be a proof or witnesses to testify, so it can be labelled as exhibitionism (which is illegal) being then enough for a police officer to take action. 

But a naked person, not showing any signs of sexual behaviour, sitting in his garden, riding a bike in front of a school, walking through a park, it's indeed a sign of bad behaviour or disrespect for others (or not, for the matter), but not illegal: You can't face legal punishment for being naked on a public area. You may be detained for altering the public order(sorry, english not my native language here) together with the people who complain about you being naked, if there is aggression of some sorts by any of the parties, but not for the fact that you are naked.

There are cases in Barcelona of people riding their bikes naked around the city. Or walking in not-nudist beaches. Not much can be done but ask politely not to do it in front of children. Given the situation, an agent may show in your property and ask you not to do it, but an agent would not break in your property to stop you unless there is a sign of exhibitionism.

[Here's a sentence](http://www.poderjudicial.es/search/doAction?action=contentpdf&amp;databasematch=AN&amp;reference=1541891&amp;links=43148370022005200080&amp;optimize=20050331&amp;publicinterface=true) about a dude being naked on a beach which is not a nudist beach.

popisfizzy,woahdude,1389955011.0,"&gt; So Euclid made math for fun? Not because it was useful?

This is a false dichotomy, because there are more than these two options. Euclid was a mathematician in a time of many mathematicians, and it would not have been out-of-the-ordinary to do math for its own sake. For example, in Euclid's time one can hardly argue that Euclid's theorem (that there are infinitely many prime numbers) was useful in any meaningful sense, even though it is certain more useful nowadays in indirect ways.

&gt; Dimensional analysis as I used the term means analyzing things in terms of dimensions.

Well, it was the incorrect term, and there is no such study of that because it would be ridiculous to study such a tiny and only-slightly-important topic for itself. That would fall under the purview of geometry, linear algebra, or perhaps topology.

&gt; Math is a tool, not some abstract truth.

You like the false dichotomies. Why must it be one and not the other? It is a tool, yes, but it also represents truths of abstract ideas. In fact, the latter is pretty much tautologically true."

This is incorrect, an economic study I read showed that this period of school has little effect on grades.

Also, the fact that 49% of jobs could be automated in the next 20 years does not mean they will, and jobs will be created."
Lluxx,changemyview,1389955397.0,"That source seems ridiculously biased. Anything that refers to transgender people as 'Gender Imposters' in the title does not strike me as a credible source. It also completely disregards the fact that transitioning alleviates dysphoria, it does not alleviate the overwhelmingly hostile society which trans individuals face. We are discussing dysphoria in particular, not social exclusion, hate crimes, violence, ostracisation and other difficulties a person may suffer if they are outed as trans. Your link provides no evidence that transgender people are attempting suicide because of continued dysphoria.

[Here is an article which proposes that it is due to social ostracisation that trans suicide rates are so high](http://www.livescience.com/11208-high-suicide-risk-prejudice-plague-transgender-people.html)

[Here is another study which notes an extremely high correlation between trans individuals who have attempted suicide and trans individuals who have suffered from discrimmination](http://www.thetaskforce.org/press/releases/pr_100710)

[Here is an article from a trans suicide preventation hotline which lists the reasons why their callers are suicidal, in order](http://www.lauras-playground.com/transgender_suicide_report.htm):

&gt; 1) Problems coming out to homophobic friends, families and co-workers. Homophobia in general including slurs.

&gt; 2) Body Image Distress or disgust - puberty

&gt; 3) Discrimination - Housing - Employment - Church's

&gt; 4) Victims of Hate crimes and/or violence

Note that this last link also states that 50% of trans individuals have attempted to commit suicide before the age of twenty (i.e. before the vast, vast majority of them would ever be able to begin hormone treatment, let alone surgery). Also note that their list does not include ""Had gender reassignment surgery and regretted it"". 

So, your link takes a statistic and uses it to further its own agenda. It does not offer any further data on the matter except correlation between being transgender and having a high suicide rate. It does not ask trans individuals why they would have attempted suicide, it does not conduct studies into whether the rate of suicide is higher before or after transitioning. It does not factor in anything to do with society.It is written by a Christian anti-transgender advocate, not a psychologist. It is ludicrously reductionist at best, akin to saying ""Homosexual individuals have a higher suicide rate than the general populace because they are in same sex relationships. Therefore homosexual relationships are wrong.""

My links, on the other hand, collect data from actual individuals and notes that those who have suffered from discrimmination - not those who have transitioned - are more at risk of suicide. So your argument that they might commit suicide because of transitioning seems weak at best; you will need to provide more sources, at the very least with testimony from professionals or people who work with transgender individuals, which prove that it is gender reassignment surgery and not discrimmination which causes high suicide rates. 

I won't argue with you about meditation because that is an entirely subjective belief and yours alone. If you wish to heal your problems by thinking about them, you're more than welcome to do so. However, if you wish to inflict your choices on those who are suffering and deny them a treatment, you will have to provide some actual evidence (from good sources) that the treatment will do more harm than good.

Well done Mr. Haass.

As for protests, I'm sorry big lad but you're going to have to get used to it. People are angry for one reason or another even if that reason is stupid but we should live in a society where you are allowed to protest without a bunch of pinko liberal bigots demanding heads on sticks. Just in the same way you or I should be allowed to protest over something you feel strongly about. Also if you haven't noticed, the flag protests are hardly causing much disruption now...unless you're a melodramatic prick who gets worried by a few scores of loyalists standing about doing nothing of any importance while the other 99.9% of Belfast get's on with it's daily life. 

As for your last point the people of Northern Ireland should be demanding a referendum. That's how it should work - but people are so apathetic towards the process of peace here that instead they'll sit back and take the metaphorical Irish Nationalist cock to agree with whatever they agree with because ""sure, those unionist bigots disagree so it's probably right.""

Lluxx,changemyview,1389957355.0,"Blanchard's theory does criticise it, but it more goes into deeper detail about different groups of MtF transsexuals and is just as widely criticised. Blanchard himself defines it is a description of behaviour, not explanation of causes and admits that we don't really know much about GID's causes because further research is needed. [This book](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bI-Jau14aLAC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) discusses the theory somewhat, as well as the problems with it. As far as the theory goes, it only discusses MtF individuals and it only discusses them in terms of sexual gratification, something which many transgender people themselves highly disagree with. 

I don't disagree with the criticisms of the brain-sex theory. You're absolutely right by saying it had a very small number of participants and the theory has a lot of flaws. I have no doubt when more research is done on the matter then the truth will be a lot more complex; with neuroscience it rarely is so neat. 

But since GID is still a well-documented condition and gender reassignment surgery is so effective in relieving the dysphoria, then I stand by my original point that it is not comparable to otherkin. As far as I'm aware, there are no studies into otherkin and it is not possible to reassign someone's species, so likely the treatment for an otherkin who is suffering true dysphoria (again, as there are no studies on them and most are self-reporting on their blogs, it is difficult to know) would have to be different as we cannot surgically allow someone to become a cat, or whatever they would like.

Basilgate,WritingPrompts,1389957797.0,"Kate ran into the house, gasping for air, and slammed the back door closed, fumbling with the lock. Somewhere, from outside, came the screech of tires and a crash of metal. An alarm followed, mingling with the screams and yells from all around. Kate fell to the floor, clasping her head and sobbing. They were all gone. Everyone. Gone. 

With a heavy, tearful breath, Kate rose to her feet. There wasn’t much time. No time to pack anything. She just had to escape. She hurried to the living room, trying the phone just in case, but wasn’t surprised by the silence on the other end. She checked her pockets for her mobile, but it must’ve fallen out when she ran from the supermarket, not that it would do much good in any case. All she needed were the car keys, but the small table by the front door, where they usually lay, was bare. Kate slid up next to the nearest window, pressing her back against the wall. Willing up all her courage she peeked through a slit in the curtains. Smoke was billowing up from somewhere out of sight, and there was rubbish strewn across the street, but her car was there, undamaged. And not a single one of those... things, could be seen.

The keys, the keys. She looked around the living room again, her panic building, until at last she remembered with terrible clarity. The kitchen. She stared at the door to it as if it were the maw of some unspeakable beast. It was fine, she told herself, it had all been thrown away. When the stories appeared on the news, she threw it away. Or did she? She wasn’t sure.

Step by step, she paced forward. Upon passing the threshold a loud bang from somewhere nearby, an explosion perhaps, had her jumping with a shrill yelp. Her heart hammered. The kitchen seemed ordinary, and safe. The cupboards, though. The cupboards. Kate scanned about, not wanting to get too close to them, and then saw her salvation, lying by the toaster, glittering like hope. It was under the cupboards, however, but there was no time to delay. She silenced the terror in her head as best she could and ran forward, grasping the keys just as the front door burst open with a sickening crunch. Kate screamed at the sight of the man, a shambling mess, his arms outstretched, his eyes wide and pale like the eggs of spiders, and from his moaning mouth, a thick yellow gunk spewed forth, splattering like mucus onto the linoleum floor with every heavy step he took. The stench of him, rich and eggy, set Kate’s stomach churning. The knives, over near the sink, may as well have been on Mars. She couldn’t move. She fumbled around behind her as the monster approached on awkward feet, yawning and wailing, driven by some hungry and malevolent will. And always, that yellow curse, the *mayonnaise*, dripping obscenely from it’s mouth. Now, only a step away from her, Kate found purchase on the toaster and swung it, with all her might, against the man’s head. Mayonnaise splattered over her face as she brought it down again and again, until her assailant was a ruin of bone, flesh and vile creamy sauce. 

Not much time, she thought when her senses returned to her, it would come alive again soon, and try to take her. She knew. She’d seen it. Oh God, she’d seen it. She looked around for the keys. For one terrible moment she thought she’d lost them again, until she saw they’d been knocked onto the floor. She stepped away from the yellow-red carcass and groped for them. She hardly heard the cupboard, just above her head, creak open. She was so occupied, as she gripped the keys in her hand, thinking of where she could possibly drive to, that she didn’t notice the big plastic bottle hobbling across the tabletop. Until it was too late. Until it’s cap flew open and a stream of mayonnaise burst forth, with a flatulent sound, all over her face. She screamed and fell backwards, trying at once to stand, but the vile substance that had leaked from the man before now slithered and streamed around her, trapping her hands. She could feel it running through her hair, a nightmare caress that slid down her head towards her mouth. The last thing she saw was the plastic bottle on the counter above her, looking down. ‘Hellman’s Mayonnaise,’ it read. Hell, she thought, as her world became yellow, HELL."

Having said all that, will Kevin Love leave? Probably. If nothing drastic changes. He'd be a perfect fit in L.A. I'd say 50% chance he's a Laker, 25% chance he goes elsewhere, and 25% chance things get righted enough here that he signs another contract with the Wolves. It's not impossible.

Sorry if the idea of taking time to google it didn't pop in my head so fast. Maybe the fact you started insulting me and didn't apologize is somehow linked to it.

Yes: the book of Job call ""dogs"" some homosexuals which where part of some clergy (reference to ancient mesopotamian scriptures) : here the ""dog"" word is used as the image of faithfulness, not as a pejorative term. (Source : wikipedia page ""homosexualité dans les sources chrétiennes latines"", no time/motivation to find an english source).

About ""mass murder of homosexuals"", I guess you're referring to Sodom. I am no theologist. Though, for what I know, the word ""homosexual"" is here used to design a lot of sexual perversions (including pedophilia, incest...). This is a reflet of the homophobia of this time, which sadly continues nowadays, sometimes using these misreadings of very old texts.

As I told from the beginning, I consider that most of the christians (at least, most of those you see on TV) are mistaken about homosexuality, and I'm sad to see that people misuse something as beautiful as Christ's message and legacy, to justify their bloody homophobia. That sometimes disgusts me, but as a French writer wrote : ""if every disgusted people leave, only the disgusting one will stay""."

The experienced player will (generally) not die in the fight and will still be ""min/maxing"" - they will usually have things like gems, enchants, glyphs, etc... I've seen SOOOO many players in LFR who have no gems, no enchants, wrong or missing glyphs, etc... Why don't these things have any bearing on LFR readiness? 

My iLVL 490 gear with full gems and enchants should at least be worth a couple more iLVLs than someone's iLVL 510 gear with no gems/enchants/etc

Buying brand x over brand y, in the vast majority of cases, does *not* advance the cause of the working class. It often advances the cause of the capitalists. Cadbury, for example, can market it's products as fair trade, workers can cough up extra money to pay for this ethical chocolate, and Cadbury can go on murdering unionists, it can fire it's workers in Tasmania, whatever. If you want to advance the cause of the workers, start agitating in your union, or unionise your workplace, or start a socialist group, or join a socialist group, or create and distribute propaganda, or agitate at your school, or protest, or organise community actions! 

Most socialists I know are also workers or students.

Couple of great stories about a raid leader I used to run with:

* Friend of mine kept dying on Archimonde... Raid leader reams him out then goes ""You know what, nevermind, you're clearly not smart enough to stay alive on this fight, so take off all your gear and go stand in the corner and watch us kill the boss""

* We ran a PUG ZA with this annoying Mage (kid sounded like he was like 12 years old, would not shut up the entire time, even during boss explanations). Raid leader is putting together a PUG Gruul. Immediately everyone goes ""we need to get this kid in vent with (raid leader) and watch the hilarity"". So we do, we get him in the group and in vent with us. 

For those who don't know/remember. The first fight in Gruul's Lair takes a good bit of setup (boss with adds, all requiring different tanks, etc). In the middle of the explanation this kid is still talking (like he's done non-stop) and finally the raid leader gets pissed and goes ""I don't give a FLYING FUCK about your shit, I'm trying to set up a fucking pull here, SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" 

The kid says, with a wavering voice, clearly about to cry ""I'm sorry"" and logs off vent and leaves raid/logs off wow.

(for those who think this is mean, this happened after the kid was asked MANY times to kindly stop talking during fight explanations)

* Similarly, on High King Maulgar, normally we had a couple of hunters tank the shaman (look this up if you don't understand what I'm talking about). Their job after this was to just DPS. They kept screwing this up. Finally, the raid leader goes ""you know what, you guys just go ahead and tank your shaman, then when he dies, go zone out because you're clearly not capable of doing the rest of this fight correctly.""

* One night, I made the mistake of asking my job on a fight (had never done it as a resto shaman before) his response? ""Let me clue you in. You are a resto shaman. I want you to unbind everything from your bars... go ahead, I'll wait. Now, I want you to bind EVERY SINGLE FUCKING BUTTON to chain heal and just slam your face into the keyboard over and over. You are now doing your fucking job. Also, cast heroism when I tell you to. That's all you do. That's your only fucking job.""

* One night, wiping on Gurtogg Bloodboil because DPS keep pulling aggro, he posted this in raid.

""How are you fucking up this fight? You have a little colored bar that says 'you are this |___| close to fucking up, when it does that you need to stop so you don't fuck up. Stop fucking up my raid. Lets pull""

But none of those things are happening right now. I'm not a Rubio basher. I'm really not, I love the guy, glad he's here, was thrilled when he electrified the team upon his arrival, blah, blah, blah. 

But you also have to admit the guy is terrible right now. That last game was a trainwreck. I'd have rather had Marko Jaric or Troy Hudson. And it wasn't even close. And yes I did cringe mightily when I wrote that. But it's true.

From personal experience, affliction is not going to do really any damage in dungeons, the mobs will not live long enough. I did demonology until around 50 or so, then went destruction. I would highly recommend the same. Don't worry about demonic fury, swap to demon form when it fills up and otherwise don't make a big deal about it. 

In dungeons, don't even bother with shadowbolts, just pick a mob and start channeling drain life.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1389961669.0,"The other questions have been answered already, so I'll give my input on blink dagger, since I've used it quite a bit.

It's actually a really good item, because it allows you to initiate with impunity. Magnetize has a very small range. Blink allows you to get magnetize off without having to rely on roll. Roll isn't a bad means of initiating, but if your team isn't quick to follow up, you can immediately die after initiating against some teams. Also, if you miss your roll, you're extremely vulnerable. With blink, you can save roll for an escape if you need, and you can also apply the slow with magnetize immediately if you want. It's not something you need every match, but it is very useful.

Also, it should be noted that if you want to silence someone in a combo, here is how you do it: stun them with grip, roll in, then drop a stone next to them and kick it. Kick's aoe is actually quite large and can even hit enemies that are slightly behind you or to the side."

Foggalong,Infographics,1389961909.0,"You're right, but only if you were stacking them as had been done in the rest of the article.. Taking the US Debt Ceiling of $16.394 Trillion and multiplying it by the [depth of a single $1 bill](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=thickness+of+a+dollar+bill) we get the height of this single stack.

&gt; 0.1 mm = 10^-4 m (= 0.0001 m)

&gt; 16,394,000,000,000 * 10^-4 = 1,639,400,000 m (~ 1 million miles)

Venus is approximately [40,790,000,000 m](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+of+venus+from+earth) from the Earth, 4.079×10^10 meters in standard form. To put this into prospective we can work out the ratio between the two distances.

&gt; 1,639,400,000 / 40,790,000,000 = 0.04019 = 4.02%

This means your assertion that they wouldn't come close to Venus was very correct, with the stack making just over 4% of the distance.

However, the article actually goes with the width of the dollar bill which is [155.956 mm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_one-dollar_bill).

&gt; 155.956 mm = 0.15596 meters

&gt; 16,394,000,000,000 * 0.15596 = 2,556,808,240,000 m  (~ 1.6 billion miles)

This is a different order of magnitude to the first distance, [1559.6 times more](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%2C556%2C808%2C240%2C000%2F1%2C639%2C400%2C000), so as you can imagine we're going a lot further.

Uranus is approximately [3,040,000,000,000 m](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Disance+of+Uranus+from+earth) from the Earth, 3.04×10^12 in standard from. To put this into prospective we can calculate the ratio again.

&gt; 2,556,808,240,000 / 3,040,000,000,000 = 0.84106 = 84.11%

So according to my calculations the dollar bills don't even reach Uranus when put this way let alone go past it as the article suggests. It gets past [Saturn](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Disance+of+saturn+from+earth) but that's it."

I'm not sure if it's the case any longer, but for that reason, Japanese doctors have for quite some time been at least partially versed in the German language (it's not simply coincidence that *Monster* is about a Japanese doctor living in Germany, seemingly a fluent speaker).

JasonWaterfall,worldnews,1389964005.0,"Money is more than a synthetic reward.
Firstly, as you note, it is a medium of exchange -- and people will still want to exchange goods and services among themselves -- just think of ebay. 
Secondly, it helps set the relative value of goods -- not everyone will want the same bundle of goods from the state, and there must be a system that compares the relative value of goods so that people get a fair amount. 
And last but not least, relative prices carry information: If the price of, say, toilet paper rises dramatically, it is clear that there is a need, and in a capitalist economy someone will service that need to make money. And even in a centrally planned economy (not sure if you're suggesting that) prices could help the planners figure out what is needed.
Also a large part of the population will still be working, and they will presumably be payed in money (as a ""synthetic reward"", as you say) and they should also be able to trade with the non-workers somehow.

You say that so many people doing nothing would be chaos, and I share your concern, but I don't see how abolishing money would change anything. In fact, money could still be used as an incentive to get people to educate themselves etc.

You say that we can't apply old solutions to new problems. But I think many of the problems remain the same.
Also, making sudden, radical changes is a dangerous game to play. Often, we don't even realize why the old solution worked, and we cannot create a good new one from scratch because the problem is too complex.
It is better to make gradual changes and see if the expected improvements appear. (Karl Popper argues for this in his book ""The Open Society and its Enemies"")
Abolishing money would be a radical break, while gradually changing its role in society is a much safer approach."

Current science points to non-Mendelian inheritance of ASDs and I don't think it's at all likely this will change or that testing will become any easier to interpret.

Look at this mess:

This is such a weak, inarticulate piece of writing that any possible impact it could have had is neutered by its own needless repetition and awkwardness. It's not going to work well as a meme because it would be embarrassing to endorse.

Very few people even had the Panthers in the playoffs this year, let alone with a bye.  

It's close between the 2, and it's a tough call because they took such different paths to the same result.

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1389966034.0,"I would think that dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt)

dy/dt = 8cos(8t)

dx/dt = 96cos(96t)

So now find what values of t occur for both sin(8t) = 0 and sin(96t) = 0.

sin(s) = 0 implies s = k\*pi, k in z

So both 8t = k1\*pi and 96t = k2\*pi

But 96 = 8\*12, so 96t is a multiple of pi whenever 8t is a multiple of pi.

So start looking at t = 0, pi/8, pi/4, and see what happens.

For t = 0, dy/dx = 8/96 = 1/12

For t = pi/8, dy/dx = 8cos(pi)/96cos(12pi) = -1/12

for t = pi/4, dy/dx = 8cos(2pi)/96cos(24pi) = 1/12

The issue you'll run in to is the thickness, so you may have to ""pack"" out the wall a bit.  Drywall in a residential application is a 1/2"" thick where a plaster assembly is usually about 1-1/4"" thick.  You may have to get creative with more lath to pack out the drywall or double up the pieces to get the new patch flush with the adjacent existing plaster.  

There are numerous tutorials online to adhere the plaster back to the lath too if you have any areas that haven't fallen yet but is obviously separating from the lath.  The most effective seems to be drilling 3/16"" holes in JUST the plaster veneer and inserting an adhesive, basically gluing it back to the lath.  There are also plaster ""buttons"" that screw the plaster back to the lath.

Good luck, and good on you and your folks for keeping it.  Once it's gone, it's gone, and you're not getting plaster back."

Renner1,canada,1389968804.0,"&gt; Hisham Al-Saedni - Head of the Jahafil Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad fi Filastin which is a Sunni jihadist Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip linked with al-Qaeda. He was actually arrested by Hamas in 2012.

This is the only one that getting rid of was a good idea-- the Palestinians deal with people like this all the time, while Israel beats up Palestinians trying to go to work and otherwise tries to make life as miserable as possible.

&gt; Ahmed Jabari - Second in command of a known terrorist group, and helped kidnap Gilad Shalit. Previously arrested by Palesntinian Authorities for blowing up a bus.

Objective news reports on the killing of Jabari will say that the circumstances are pretty murky surrounding his death. He was supposed to be a large influence in regard to the people in Hamas who wanted to uphold the cease-fire with the Israelis-- before the Israelis broke (again) the cease-fire, at any rate.

&gt; Zuhir al-Qaisi - High ranking officer in the Popular Resistance Committees, who are responsible for numerous bombings on unarmed people.

No word about the Israelis who largely set the precedent on that score, right? But the actions of the PPCs are always heinous, whereas incineration through white phosphorus, or death by cluster bomb, or whatever else-- well, there's always a way to excuse it when Israelis kill unarmed people.

Can't forget that direct military action by the PPCs against Israeli soldiers and other armed elements of the Israeli government is also ""terrorism"" and ""an atrocity""."

Ah, Pascal's Wager. You know, there is a good possibility that you'd be fucked. What if Allah is God, and Muhammed (PBUH) is his Prophet? Then you wouldn't be saved. A large number of Evangelical Christians would claim that you're going to Hell.

Now most of your blithely repetitive statements of ""How is that bad?"" is not actually bad. Most of them, though, *don't require to be a member of COLDS.* I know tons of folks who don't smoke or drink, but aren't Mormon. There are literally billions of people who have learned compassion and to be of service, but they're not Mormons. There are a metric shit-ton of folks who have self-worth who aren't Mormons. There are a huge number of people who actually help people in need.

COLDS has taken the good things of life and sold them back to you. COLDS isn't good in spite of the people; COLDS is good *because* of the people. The people bring the worth.

&gt;No, I don't think I've been lied to.

You're simply unaware, then. You have been lied to by the corporate institution that is COLDS. Numerous times. Just because you are unaware of it does not mean that you aren't a victim of it. Again, if you need a substantial list of instances, let me know.

&gt;Do I think that for one second if any prophet led his people astray that he would remain a prophet for much longer? Yes.

Not according to Wilford Woodruff. ""Removed from their place,"" remember?

You know that according to D&amp;C, polygamy was revealed to him *before* the sealing power of the priesthood, right? And the only reason that the D&amp;C claims that is because by 1831 or 1832 Smith was fucking Fanny Alger.

I don't know that he ready but i think he is a bit further along than Fredricks is as a RB.  

Getting Fredricks out on loan for the rest of the season may let us actually see what we have with him, so far he has been a guy we haven't been able to get out on loan and never gets capped for the England U-'x' squads.  Really all we have on him is a bit against Anzhi to figure out who he is and what he can do.

Renner1,canada,1389970486.0,"This post is a joke. 

If you want to have a dialogue about people who are clearly very fundamentalist or very conservative-- Salafis, for one thing, although there are Salafis who are adaptable and behave themselves, or someone affiliated with Anjem Chaudary in the UK or say Hizb-ut-Tahrir (which is a banned organization in many evil scary Muslim majority nations)-- then there's nothing wrong with that.

Indeed, there are plenty of Muslim people (as ""Muslim"" is not a monolithic, homogenous codifier for how someone is and behaves, outside of ""they're a part of one of the Abrahamic faiths"") who do see the need to address instances of religious extremism or ultra-fundamentalism that pop up here and there.

I don't see anything worthwhile about this post-- it's ""we all know Islam is bad and malevolent and women hating and yadda yadda yadda-- but the heroes who hate the Muslims and want them out of their country, because they're all extreme fundamentalists, should stop being racist"".

Most of the people who like to go around saying ""Muslims in Canada= Al Qaeda"" are by default racists. Their views on Islam are intrinsically tied into their views on race-- and no, they will not stop being racist towards people that they think ""are racially tied to Islam"". That's just how they operate. 


OP endorses groups like the EDL and the others who draw their support from the ""paki-bashers"" in England, and with the same sort of modus operandi concerning the far, far right throughout Europe. 

OP claims that these groups are some sort of untouchable, righteous vanguard of the ""West"". 
That says a lot and it's pretty pathetic.


TL; DR: Criticism of extreme attitudes or severe religious fundamentalism is a must, but to claim that the worst offenders are ""the true Islam"" and that ""Islam is aggressive, monolithic, and inherently dangerous"" is getting into the realm of severe irrationality and doesn't solve jack shit in regard to extremism or hard fundamentalism.

Also, OP endorses groups that are blatantly racist and claims that they aren't racist. "

But the intrinsic value of the stock is something different.  It's how much money the company is expected to make and pay out in dividends to the stockholder.  Of course some companies aren't making money at the moment and are paying no dividends.  The value there is that stockholders expect them to make money in the future and pay a dividend.  

If you look at mature stocks like McDonald's, you'll notice they've been reliably paying dividends for years.  This is a stable stock that gives you a quarterly payment, and people hold it like a high interest bank account.  Stocks like Tesla are different.  They aren't mature and are still growing.

So I wasn't allowed to hold a leg up or anything.

But my sister in law is a delivery nurse so she acted as dula and held the leg...was a massive extra bonus in the room. 

I inadvertently got a side view at one point that looked like some blown out bacon that made me realize I was glad she kept me up by her head (surgery blood and guts really makes me queasy/woozy..even though I can watch the beginning of Saving Private Ryan with no issues). 

I know some dudes who can just be all up in the business and film it, but ...not for me. I think a dude would know up front if he's going to have issues or not. 

But if a nurse or dr tells him to sit down , even if he thinks he doesn't need to ... he needs to do it, because they don't need to handle you + a fainted husband at the same time, and they can see cues in his face that tell them ...have the man sit.

vehementvelociraptor,AskMen,1389970761.0,"United States, pro gun.

Let me lead off by saying that if there were a measure to 100% guarantee that every gun on earth would be destroyed and the technology to create them also destroyed, I'd 100% support it.

That's not going to happen.  The fact is that outlawing guns in america won't stop gun violence.  I can go on the wrong side of town and buy a handgun without a serial number in probably 20 minutes if I wanted to.

Also the fact that all this anti-gun legislation is trying to ban long-rifles is retarded.  Long guns account for &lt;10% of all gun crime in america.  I don't know the exact figure but I know it's less than that.  Probably even less than 5%.

I'm just not in favor of policies that will guarantee my denial of access to firearms, while not guaranteeing a criminal's access.  Which should be the whole point.

doc_birdman,batman,1389970770.0,"I just bought a very cheap tablet strictly for the purpose of reading eComics on the go. 

I see this thread seems split: some advocating pirating comics and some saying pay for them. Here is my humble opinion. I don't make a lot of money, less than $2,000 a month. So yes, I do go to a website that has thousands of comics to read for free. That being said, I DO purchase at least two or three comics a month. Sometimes I'll read a first issue online then fall in love with the series and buy physical copies. Sometimes I find an arc that is out of print or has a hard to find TPB so I read it online to save money.
If I were to purchase every series that I want to it would cost me close to $500 a year. Don't judge us too harshly for enjoying our passion while trying not to break the bank. At least some of us show our appreciation. "

Renner1,canada,1389970781.0,"&gt; No one here is saying Islam is bad.

OP is. 

&gt; What people are saying is we should be concerned about a large number of people who accept that certain people have more rights than others. 

Who isn't concerned about it? It's gone into extreme overdrive all over the forums in which it's being discussed.

The main problem as I see it is that people are taking these events, which are behaviourally consistent with someone who is extremely conservative/ possibly conservative Islamist (at least in regard to the martial arts incident), and then collectively applying it to anyone who has any association with any form or manifestation of Islam."
