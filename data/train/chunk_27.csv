We love Arkham Horror.  So I rushed faster than I should have to start getting expansions for it, and I really don't enjoy them that much.  I like the new investigators.  And I like the Injury/Madness cards.  But i hate the new boards.  

Kingsport, it seems you just HAVE to have someone there to take care of the rifts.  And that's that players entire game.  Preventing rifts.

In Dunwitch, most of the time you can just pretend it's not even there.  Monsters spawn there pretty rarely.  

So now i don't even know if I want to bother with the last two big box expansions.  

I do like the first expansion for Race for the Galaxy though.  More cards and the ""goals"" are fun, I think.  I heard the 2nd one almost ruins the game, so I think I'll just stay with the one.

The only other expansion I have is Intrigue for Dominion.  And none of my friends want to play Dominion anymore, so I've only played one game with the new cards.  :(

Anyway, I plan on being much more careful about when I buy expansions, and what i buy them for now."

I asked my dad if I could get an ice cream and he said no I couldn't have any money for it. So I went outside, dejected, watching all of the other kids buying their ice cream cones. The older sister of one of the girls my age realized that I hadn't been able to get any ice cream, so she bought me one. Shortly thereafter, my dad came outside and saw me with an ice cream and got super pissed. He used his signature line for when I was in trouble ""cmcase, tell the girls goodbye,"" told me to put the ice cream in the freezer, and sent me to my room. When he finally told me it was ok to come out of my room, I told him what had happened, that I didn't ask for the ice cream, that my friend's sister had just bought it for me, but he still wasn't buying it. Regardless, he told me I could have my ice cream now, but when I went to get it, my little brat of a brother had eaten it.

My second was a doctor recommended elective c section (as same issues were present second time). I again felt guilty that I couldn't do it naturally but I recovered in a month - I think because it was planned and I was prepared for it.

My third did not have the same issues - she was smaller, more normal sized, and better positioned. However, in Ireland, if you have had 2 c sections, they will not allow a natural birth after, so I had a third, again feeling guilty going in.

When my third, now 5 year old, was born, the first thing I heard the doctor say when he took her out was 'lucky baby to be born this way'. She had the cord wrapped around her neck, and apparently well wrapped in a way that would have made a natural birth extremely dangerous for her.

I have never again felt a moment of guilt, and am grateful every day that I had those 2 c sections, that necessitated a third c section."

This is pretty much exactly where I am at. Power is a big (the biggest?) theme of the story. A question that is asked over and over again is, what does it mean to be in a society were you have inherently less power because of your gender? How do different people react to, and deal with, that fact? Calling the show feminist might be a bit much. However, by focusing on these issues, the show is more interesting to watch for people that care about this stuff, and I have no doubt it will make some people think about this sort of thing who would not have otherwise.

Renner1,canada,1389972595.0,"&gt; and I've stated my issues in this very thread over and over again.

I've only seen you talking about israeli settlers being killed and pretending that it happened for no reason apart from murderousness.

Where's your condemnation of the thousands of Palestinians killed by Israelis? Or the fact that the Israelis lie about it?

&gt; No you didn't.

I did, actually. I don't condemn them for a whole lot of things, but I said that I thought that suicide bombing, tactically, was poorly planned in general. 

I said that I understood that people who've seen hundreds of their countrymen and women killed or wounded by an entity claiming that it's ""the one for peace"", with a largely indifferent israeli public, would want to take revenge in whatever way possible-- but I believe very much that suicide attacks should've focused on military or Israeli security targets exclusively.

I also criticized Hamas's connections with the MB in Egypt and the fact that they may have been turning a blind eye to the small Salafi Jihadi cells creeping across the border with Egypt.

But on the whole, I'm far more sympathetic to the Palestinians and the Palestinian cause then anything related to the Israelis."

Now substitute in terms of a_1 to get (a_1 + 2)/(a_1 + 6) = (a_1 + 6)/(a_1 + 9).

scooper1030,nba,1389972870.0,"Nash's stats certainly weren't the best. But you have to consider how much he carried those Suns teams.

2004-05: The Suns have just signed Q-Rich and Nash in the offseason. They are predicted by ESPN to finish 10th in the West, barely better than the year before.

Nash leads them to a 62-20 record, first in the West. Stoudemire and JJ have career-best years, while Marion and Richardson also do incredibly well. 

2005-06: Amar'e Stoudemire, who put up 26.1 PPG the season before, has just gone down with injury and is out for the year. Joe Johnson was traded, and incoming players Boris Diaw and Raja Bell don't look like they're capable of matching that production.

The Suns go 54-28 and make the WCF. Boris Diaw goes from shooting 42% from the field the year before to shooting 53%, and he wins the MIP award. Meanwhile, Raja Bell puts up career-best shooting numbers and establishes himself as one of the league's best sharpshooters, making more threes in his first season with Phoenix than he did the five years prior. 

A young Brazilian by the name of Leandro Barbosa is also coming onto the scene, putting up a career-high 13.1 PPG. He would win 6MotY the next season.

You could say that these are all coincidences, but I think it would be a funny coincidence that almost every player who played with Nash during those years just happened to increase their production exponentially. 

Bottom line is, regardless of stats, Nash won games. He made his teammates better. Kobe did not. "

MR502,AskReddit,1389972900.0,"I intitally started working in security after I was discharged from active duty back in late 08. 

Well, I got my first civilian job for a local firm, and it was awful. The hours were always graveyard and the job sites were low income section 8 housing apartments in the ghetto. Despite having my armed permit and vest, I was pretty much alone for 10 hours until my shift was over. 
My first night on the job I encountered a prostitute giving a customer a blow job in his car...of course I let them finish, it's rude to interrupt. 

Had to call in 4 domestic disputes, deal with the homeless, vandalism, and noise complaints. Given the fact that the complex was poorly lit, being attacked on the job was a constant danger, since the idiots that ran the firm were adamant about having their guards resemble the local police department. 

I ended up quitting that firm due to poor pay practices (late checks) and labor law violations. Not to mention the hours were just awful and the job sites were shitty altogether. 

So I then moved on to working in nightclubs starting off in small i.e. (ghetto) nightclubs, became pretty good at breaking up brawls (women fight the dirtiest) and you know what, it doesn't matter if it's the most ghetto club or the highest class of club. Some nasty activities are going the bathrooms. 

Nothing like walking in and seeing people fucking or about to fuck, how about doing a line or two of blow. Yep that was too damn common, I got the call to check the bathrooms, and it's locked so I think that's really fucking odd, only a handful of people in this club have the keys for that. So I get my supervisors key and opened the door, walked into the men's room and seen this guy, pants down just railing the head waitress in the stall. No shame just pounding away, I radio my suspervisor and tell him what I see. 

I kid you not I hear ""don't bother let 'em finish"" so I lock the door and go back to watching the floor, turns out it was some off-duty sergeant from the local P.D. and is a good friend of the owner.

schwann,news,1389972973.0,"&gt;There are so many examples of injustice perpetrated daily in the courtrooms of the U.S. that it's not entirely irrational for someone to want to avoid going there when they accidentally make a mistake. 

The court system is meant to apply the law, not justice.

&gt;And, for all we know she's been abused by the police or knows someone who has been recently abused by the police and the court system. 

Now you are drawing conjectures out of thin air.

&gt;So the idea that everyone should up and report themselves to the police every time they make a mistake, especially when it involves a stressful and traumatic situation, is asking a bit much. 

Two girls died. Two other living human beings died. She might have been the cause. Whatever trauma she might have been experiencing does not come close to what she had done inadvertently. Law or no, she should have come forward the second she learned of the possibility. Her age and bad past experiences (if she had any) does not negate that both morally and by law, she should have come forward.

&gt;She may have tried to cover up a mistake but, in my opinion, that hardly makes her evil, or irrational, or even guilty of anything worth charging her for.

She may not be irrational or evil, but she is guilty and immoral. The law is quite clear, as both judge and jury found. That she was freaking out is not an excuse."

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1389973043.0,"(2x + 3)^(1/2) + 2 = (6x + 7)^(1/2)

So x &gt;= -3/2 and x &gt;= -7/6. Since -7/6 &gt; -3/2, we test our solutions at the end to make sure that x &gt; -7/6.

(2x + 3)^(1/2) + 2 = (6x + 7)^(1/2) (given)

2x + 3 + 4(2x + 3)^(1/2) + 4 = 6x + 7 (square both sides)

4(2x + 3)^(1/2) = 4x (subtract 2x + 7 from both sides)

(2x + 3)^(1/2) = x (divide both sides by 4)

2x + 3 = x^(2) (square both sides)

x^(2) - 2x - 3 = 0 (subtract 2x + 3 from both sides)

(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 (solve the quadratic equation)

Possible solutions are x = 3 or x = -1.

Both 3 and -1 are greater than -7/6, so both are valid solutions."

It's a ""closed"" loop where the majority of goods pass through three points and only small amounts escape outwards into other areas. There is nothing wrong with keeping trade locked into a 3 way path. 

Now if you're saying the wealth all moving one direction, towards europe, is appropriate I'd agree were this 100% historically accurate. Had The cherokee formed a mighty empire much of US wealth would have remained in the US instead of flowing East. It's why trade direction must be determined by trade power and not enforced by forced trade pathing.

""Alright dude, I'm gonna have a blob of thirty gaunts and I'm gonna give them cover by putting biovores, zoanthropes, the swarmlord, tyrant guard and a venomthrope in front. yeah that'll give my valuable gaunts some protection.""/""Yknow monstrous creatures are a lot more fragile without access to iron arm. I've acknowledged this and instead of playing them differently, I'm still just gonna charge blindly up the field and hope to tank wounds""

Not to mention the criticisms I've seen from people who (obviously) have not played a game yet treat every suggested combo as if it's the only thing their army is facing. ""Lictor/Trygon combo doesnt work because the lictor is super easy to kill"" ok but if it's shrouded behind a tyrannofex and there's like four other MC's and 60 gaunts running at you, is the Lictor really your biggest threat?

Case in point, quipps calling Zoanthropes easy to kill because you can drown them with weight of fire. I guess you're gonna spend your entire shooting phase going after 50 pt models when the rest of the list has a potential 5 FMC's and hordes of infantry that you don't need to also drown with weight of fire...

Criticisms of the Nid dex have been blown way out of proportion by people who obviously don't own it from the minute it dropped. Good players have found amazing builds for the dex utilizing almost every unit (no pyrovores still haha) and bad players have given up now that they can't spam tervigons. Getting really old."

It happened very, very slowly over the course of the next couple months. I think my hormones are broken. Lol"

cirocco,AskWomen,1389973606.0,"As you probably know since you're pregnant (congrats!), you can do diagnostic tests as part of IVF before embryos are implanted or using CVS at 10-12 weeks or using amnio at 15-20 weeks. The first is wildly expensive and the last two are invasive and carry a risk of miscarriage. Further, NO diagnostic tests are 100% reliable -- all have limitations.

Testing mom's blood for baby's DNA is possible for detecting some chromosomal abnormalities but it is *very* new science and doesn't have the sensitivity needed to detect the vast majority of microdeletions.

Even with known genetic syndromes which include ASDs, the variability of presentation even within a family or between parent and child is just enormous. There's not a lot of predictive value.

The hypothetical in this question probably won't come to pass for many generations and in some aspects might even be impossible. "

Jews are shrewdly negotiating with their deity and they're all like ""We need our slaves, God"".

God shows up in person, in his full might and majesty (but decides not to kill everyone who looks upon him, because Godly reasons) and says ""No. You will not own slaves. If you own slaves, you will fuck you up personally. Also if you don't worship me, I will fuck you up. I love you.""

boom. Now you're not being punished by God, you're being punished for disobeying God.

just like ""God doesn't send you to hell, you go to hell for disobeying God.""

free will intact, God doesn't look like a moron.

EDIT: or God could have stopped beating around the bush and outright made slavery physically impossible. unable to occur in our natural universe.

at that point, our free will would be impinged about as much as it is when we learn we cannot fly without technology.

that is to say, none at all.

ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1389974211.0,"&gt;  He and his family were little more than peasants but they resisted the idea of collective farming.

The majority of Russian farmers farmed 'collectively' before, during, and then after feudalism. The people who didn't were generally upper-middle-class. Usually, the disagreement was about the government revoking personal ownership to the land.

Not that Rand is educated enough to know the difference, so I guess I'll give him a pass.

&gt; As trade began to blossom with China, many conservatives, myself included, came to admit that trade improves our economic well-being AND makes us less likely to fight. 

For Rand Paul, you only kill people if you can't make money off of them. Even if they're massive violators of human rights and destroying the planet's climate with pollution.

Yes, let's destroy Iran, who talks a big game but has speck-like military significance. Who gives a flying fuck about Tibet?

Or maybe that's it - he likes easy targets so he can feel like America has a big dick.

&gt; I really am a believer that foreign policy must be viewed by events as they present themselves, not as we wish them to be.

&gt; I look at the worldwide menace of radical jihad and I think we need a long-term vigilance like containment.

Large-scale failure to contain terrorism leading to increasing political relevance of these groups in countries, as the vox populi decides it wants its sovereignty back *is* the way events have presented themselves, Rand.

I mean, you'd know that if you knew any Irish history. Or really, any Russian history. Or British imperial history.

The Boston bombers? They came from a region of Russia which was shot into submission by the Empire. Guess why things are still fucked up over there?

&gt;  Likewise, we should be engaging the Russians to assist us with the Syrians and the Iranians.

""See, we need to negotiate - just not with the smelly brown people.""

This whole article is revolutionary - it turns out *erectus* are among us still, and being elected to public office! Paul can't keep two stupid thoughts in his head at once to analyze dissonance between them. And *his* first response to slights is to want to bomb someone, not maybe understand why they say what they say, or do what they do. He is completely ignorant of history - happy to trade with a government who starved millions to death, but unwilling to compromise with Iran - and I can't imagine what it says about this country that he's still being elected.

By this standard, say a pro-secularist socialist who is a Muslim (of any sect, or any level of religiousity, from anywhere) is put on the same level as say someone who is sympathetic to Salafi Jihadism or takfirism and decided to go to Syria to kill the Alawis and the Shia's and the Sunnis that aren't ""conservative enough""."

It's definitely all *Gone with the Wind*, but there's a very noticeable accent. Having moved to the mid-west, no one sounds like everyone sounds back home. There's the Southern accent stereotype, and then there's the actual Southern accent. It's still slurred and slow.

tandeg,footballmanagergames,1389974471.0,"Well, for one, you need to know the difference between Current Ability (CA), and potential Ability (PA). Most youth players with a ridiculous CA for their age will have good PA, but that doesn't mean that low CA players can't have high PA. You can only find out PA through reports from scouts (or your assistant manager or coaches if they're on your team). The better this scout or coach is a judging potential ability, the more accurately you can predict it.

Secondly, you have to think about what attributes he has, in regards to what position he plays or what position you want him to play. You can see what attributes are important for a certain position by looking at the training schedules for that position, or individual player roles in your tactical overview.

That player, for one, has great speed. He will be able to achieve 20 in both speed and acceleration with the right training regimen. Very quick players tend to be great at creating space and chances for themselves regardless of their other attributes. Apart from that he has other relatively high attributes for his age that fits the ""Poacher"" role. Namely finishing, dribbling, composure, and off the ball. All key attributes for a good poacher.

From his coaches report, you can see he also has good potential ability, so with the right training regiment, tutoring, etc. he can become a good player, though he is mostly suited to be a poacher, and might not excel as far as he can if you choose to train him in a different role.

For instance he does not have the creativity or passing skills to be a Trequartista, or the crossing to be a very effective winger (not to mention you'd have to retrain his position, which wastes time you could have used to improve his attributes).

Basically, look for potential ability, and a collection of key skills that fits a certain role or position. Good CA can be a good indicator for someone you need to scout, or make him ready for first team football earlier, but is not the be all and end all for a player to develop."

A Song of Ice and Fire come close, but is less dry than the histories of middle earth, so it's almost a tie. Additionally, Tolkien's work had a lot of idyllic personalities.

OklaJosha,rawdenim,1389975588.0,"I got these at Blue in Green in Soho a couple days ago. I've been wanting some PBJs for awhile. Really digging on the denim &amp; fade pics I've seen of them. 

I forgot the name of the guy who helped me at Blue in Green, but they were very helpful in helping me choose a pair. I was originally going to get the once washed version, but they were out of my size. So I got the raw that are supposed to shrink down to the same size.

I was scared at how large the raws were originally but they shrank down like they said for the most part. Not quite as much as I was hoping in the waist or length. But leg, thigh, &amp; rise shrinkage really surprised me.

They hemmed the jeans, based on expected shrinkage, for me that day since I was visiting from out of town; it only took a couple hours.

Thoughts: Really great denim, I've only had unbranded before. I'm loving the slubby (correct term?) denim. I like the slim tapered fit. I wish the back rise was an inch or two longer. Also, worried about the waist that didn't shrink quite as much as I was wanting. If they stretch too much (which I hear they do) i might be in trouble.

Question: Cuffed or uncuffed? Thoughts? I like uncufffed better, but they are slightly long since I had to get them hemmed before I left.

TLDR: Love them, wish they had the one wash version in my size, shrinkage is hard to control. If these had longer back rise, they'd be perfect. Cuff or No?"

Where she loses me is she jumps from ""this should not be called feminist and I personally don't enjoy watching it"" (fine), to ""this show sexualizes women and does not give women equal power to men and that is bad"". I think the guys on the show are also sexualized (yes to a lesser degree), and sexualization ain't inherently bad.

It's purr is barely audible, because it sounds muffled, as if it were underwater.  It's just not worth moving your body with its 500 pound heart and 200 pound arms for such an experience.  In fact, you find that there is nothing that is worth it after trying everything several times. So you stop making the painstaking effort to experience happiness or pleasure of any sort.  The only thing that pays off is the experience of not moving or getting out of bed.  The cost of this, in effort, is zero and maybe after a while you may start feeling the comfort of your bed and nothing and I mean nothing has any payoff greater than that.  That pleasure normal people get by temporary ""cheering-up"" events/stimulus?  It just Does. Not. Happen. and not for lack of trying. While profoundly depressed, I would often describe it as ""My heart just hurts."""

dicksalsa,AskWomen,1389976098.0,"I was kind of a hardcore ugly duckling up until a point, and now I'm considered to be very beautiful.  My change in appearance was sudden and happened over a summer where I didn't see many people, and there is a striking difference in the way people treat me.  That in and of itself has made me much more cynical, because I hadn't expected the difference to be so extreme.  

Before I got pretty, I got ignored a lot.  And I mean a lot.  I had a couple of close girl friends, but aside from them, I could literally go about my life as usual and not talk ANYONE for weeks at a time.  When those friends were sick/out of town, all of my social interaction was completely gone.  It was like I was invisible.  But, at the same time, I knew that those friends were genuine, and that they truly liked me for me.  I preferred that.  

Now, I am never sure who is genuine or who is only interested in me because I'm pretty.  I get a ton of attention now - I am never alone.  I am surrounded by friends, and whenever I am by myself running errands or something, people will strike up conversations with me.  I get approached often now by men who are only interested in my appearance.  They are usually very boring conversationalists and will take offense if I try to return to whatever I was doing before.  As for my friends - I am fully aware that every one of my male friends would sleep with me, given the chance.  It's very tiring to know that I am constantly being viewed sexually by people I don't reciprocate those feelings for, and I always wonder how many of them are only friends with me because I am pretty.  I had very few friends before.  I act no differently than I did before.  Suddenly I am surrounded by people, because I am pretty.  

Would I change how I look, given the chance?  No.  Would I like our society to change so that women aren't valued so disproportionately for their appearance?  Hell fucking yes.  "

aDDnTN,motorcycles,1389976466.0,"i'm assuming this is what you have? [motorcycle floor jack](http://customchopperbuilderstoolbox.com/library/MotorcycleLift_OTC1545.jpg)

No.

you shouldn't ever jack under the exhaust or motor if there aren't frame rails under it. even if the pipe doesn't crush, think about what you are doing to the headers and the clamps. Mess those up and you are in for a world of pain (drill out and tap block, install studs). Or bust your sump pan and have to replace it.

Those floor jacks are made for bikes with the frame running under the bottom. See HD, triumph t100, honda vintage cb, etc; classic styled bikes, cruisers, and dirt bikes; bikes that have frame rails running **under** the engine.

For your bike, you should use stands. Your bike likely has locations for bobbins on the rear, if not also the front. Buy some bobbins, install on rear and get a rear stand. For the front i recommend triple tree stands, as they lift the bike at a more stable point that also allows removal of the front wheel and forks.

Always lift the rear stand first. never lift the front stand without the rear stand up already.

http://www.pit-bull.com/motorcycle-stands.shtml

habor freight et al sell them too. They come in steel and aluminum, painted or otherwise. be sure to get the paddles for the rear stand, even if you use bobbins. You never know when a buddy might need a lift.

PS: according to some quick searching i did, the bobbins can also be 10mm bolts. http://www.riderforums.com/general-z1000-z750/6018-paddock-stand-bobbins-size.html

or if you want ""proper bobbins"" http://www.amcmotorcycles.com/contents/en-uk/p36030_Z750___Z750S_Paddock_Stand_Bobbins_M10_Size___Various_Colours_-_see__General_Accessories__.html

these are just starting places. your local shop will likely have some that fits or be happy to order them. same for revzilla or any other online store you prefer.

CadHuevFacial,AskReddit,1389976782.0,"I agree fully. I will clarify, though, there is a difference between feminists feeling entitled to and demanding the same systematic rights and privileges men benefit from that we currently don't (i.e. not being leered at/harassed/photoshopped into oblivion, not being overlooked as qualified applicants in job applications), and women feeling entitled to *better* or *equal* treatment in instances where they are not as qualified or deserving of that treatment as another who happens to be a man is, simply because they are female (i.e. mothers of questionable aptitude being more likely to receive child custody than capable fathers, women feeling they deserve to be hired over a qualified man in a job they are not qualified for). The latter is obviously not feminist and it is not acceptable. We think it's just as offensive to call men 'dicks' in a pejorative fashion as we do calling women/men 'bitches', 'cunts', 
'sluts', or 'pussies'. It is *not* ok to think it's acceptable to call a man a dick because men call us -insert sexist term-.

biffysmalls,Edmonton,1389976905.0,"1. The Province didn't fund the arena project. There was no injection of cash. The city took out debt for a bunch of capital projects in that area (as well as in Quarters and Belvedere), and is using the incremental increases in local assessments as a result of those projects to skim the incremental increases in Education Taxes over the baseline year to pay back that debt. 

2. You're right, they don't have anything to do with each other. Rejecting this has nothing to do with the arena...but everything to do with the almost $1B a year in grant funding the City receives for municipal and transportation services and capital projects. If it's already spent it, that isn't the Province's issue. The province has its own transit priorities--specifically a high speed rail link between Calgary, Red Deer and Edmonton (and eventually Fort Mac). If the city would find a way to integrate its own transit network into high speed rail, there may be a more strategic argument to be made for expanding LRT using Provincial funds over and above what they already contribute."

Edit: [Harvard Health Publications](http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/Microwave-cooking-and-nutrition.shtml)

&gt;As far as vegetables go, it’s cooking them in water that robs them of some of their nutritional value because the nutrients leach out into the cooking water. For example, boiled broccoli loses glucosinolate, the sulfur-containing compound that may give the vegetable its cancer-fighting properties as well as the taste that many find distinctive and some, disgusting. The nutrient-rich water from boiled vegetables can be salvaged and incorporated into sauces or soups.

And the victims comment was directed towards how being drunk whilst having sex does not always mean rape. (That doesn't mean it cannot though, that's not what I'm trying to say.) We can both agree that we cannot always determine the truth of rape claims though, and it is probable that many rapes go unreported, so we cannot accurately determine either way. 
I don't know what subreddits you frequent, nor do you I. But I haven't gotten the vibe that most redditors think rape is okay or that being a woman on reddit devalues your opinion.

If the bike is in PERFECT shape and you have all the original parts, then yeah, you can get the best price.

But if it's beat up, or you don't have any of the original parts you removed (maybe because it came that way, or maybe because you just left them where they fell?) then you might not get what you ""think"" it's worth.

IMO, it's like buying a house. The seller sets a price. The buyer makes an offer. That offer should be directly proportion to how much (%) he wants the house.

Someone that wants a house 100% will beat out someone that only wants it 80%. In todays market, with short sells and forclosures, sometimes 100% isn't good enough, you have to go to 150% or more. Sucks because it prevents people without huge piles of cash from getting the best deals on homes."

scottious,getdisciplined,1389977945.0,"You're 16, you're on this subreddit.  This is a good thing!

What /u/TheGreatestZenMaster said is definitely very insightful.  Here's my take on it:

1)  Spend some time to think about what you want your future self to have.  Get acquainted with your future self.  Do you want a house?  A stable and well-paying career?  A girlfriend/boyfriend?  Do you want good health?

2)  Next, think about how to give your future self those things.  Will playing video games all day help achieve those goals?  Probably not.  How will you convince somebody to pay you good money?  By acquiring a skill that's worth good money.  How will you have the body that you want to have?  By diligently eating well and exercising regularly.

3)  How can you start building these things into your life?  You know that these things don't come easy.  Even if you work your ass off for a full month with zero procrastination, you will be very unlikely to accomplish anything truly meaningful.  It'll take a lot longer than that.

4) Realize that in order to accomplish anything, it'll take work.  A lot of work.  If part of your identity is hating work, you're gonna have a bad time and you won't stick with it.  **Learn to love hard work**.  So many people out there think, ""Work bad, leisure good"".  **This is a fundamental mistake**.  Believe that you can *learn to enjoy hard work*.  Make it part of who you are as a person.  A wise man once said, ""If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.""  **This is your goal**

5) Now once you realize this, slowly start to change your identity.  Become the kind of person that people view as a ""hard worker"".  Re-affirm this identity whenever you can.  Become the kind of person who is known as ""the gym rat"".  Become the kind of person that people say, ""I don't know how he does it..."".  Become the kind of person that a significant other would *want to be with*.

6) **Have compassion**.  You *will* screw up.  A lot.  Do *not* expect perfection out of yourself.  There will be days when you're lazy.  There will be days when you aren't doing what you think you should be doing.  You'll procrastinate.  Don't beat yourself up over it.  Be *nice* to yourself and really work hard to reward yourself when you do well.  Pat yourself on the back for accomplishing something, even if it's small.

7) **Stay positive**.  No brainer.  Just be positive about everything if you can.  Nothing that we encounter day-to-day is inherently good or bad, it's all how you interpret it.  Are you in pain from working out?  Interpret the pain as accomplishment.  Worn out from studying?  You're giving yourself the gift of knowledge.

8) Failure is just part of the game.  Learn to love it.  Fail early, fail often.  Don't be afraid of failure.  Stare it in the face and tell it that you're not scared."

Devils advocate: to have sex with someone while drunk is dangerous as you may have sex with someone who doesn't want it and wouldn't have agreed to it while sober. To err on the side of caution would mean prohibiting sex situations where consent is unclear and rape is a legitimate danger. This might prevent many rapes from happening. 

Keep in mind, we punish drunk drivers for putting others in risky situations. We don't only punish drunk drivers when they actually crash and hurt someone.

Trying to sabotage her relationship with Flynn, demanding she never grow up and leave the house, claiming other people will only love Rapunzel for the things she can offer her, kissing HER HAIR to show affection (I only love you for what you do for me), digs to a completely healthy girl about her weight, sheltering her excessively and then claiming she's naive and inexperienced, calling her ditzy and vague while only allowing her access to a few books as though any lack of knowledge is Rapunzel's doing...

Rapunzel is a tragically good example of the GC. She's golden when she's obedient, and she's brought down any time she wants to grow up and be independent. Any time she has a mind of her own.

It went from freaking me out to being one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. We dramatically sing the Mother Knows Best song when I get off the phone with my mom. We use that song to show people who don't QUITE get it just how fucked up my mother is to my brother and I. The vindication at the end (spoiler: She gets her bio family back, and they love her immediately and completely and support her love of a bandit, and they even express gratitude to the HORSE that brought her back!!) is amazing.

People *will* love you for who you are. You are special, you are important, you do matter, your mother doesn't define you, you can find happiness and love... Amazing things to see.

And when you realize the darker theme (you'll only escape your Nmom when she's dead) it's something to hold onto when you're in a bad place. Since we don't condone harming other people or throwing them off a tower, No Contact will suffice to bring freedom and joy to our lives.

Love. This. Movie."

Pit_Sweat,seduction,1389978306.0,"Got a couple more tips for you based on what you just told me. When talking to girls (and really people in general) you'll want to focus on the *whys* rather than the *whats*. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you don't *actually* care what she's studies or which sports she likes - you are looking for something in common that you can share. And you don't really share ""interests"" despite what everyone says - you share *feelings* that come from those interests. 

A girl might ""like"" to go to the gym and lift weights, but if she's just going it to look good and doesn't share my sentiment of the thrill of pushing yourself regularly and watching yourself lift heavier and heavier, then we don't really have that in common, do we?

So, talk in feelings, not facts.

Another thing is, focus on what you're *both* passionate about. The conversation is as much about you as it is about her - so many guys only prompt her on what she appears to like that it becomes obvious he's just going through the gestures, doesn't really care what she likes, and is trying to get in her pants. You said that you want to encourage her to talk about her band - is that just because *she's* passionate about it, or are you as well?

If you follow these rules, then the only time you'll run out of things to talk about is when you genuinely have nothing in common, which would make it a good thing anyway."

I'm a single mom, 21, working as a cook in Seattle. I live in Kitsap County, which is across the Puget Sound. MY mother has been a dream; She watches my daughter for me while I'm at work. I pay for a lot of things to help make up for it.

I work typically 60 hours a week, for up to two weeks with no days off, and work no less than 10 hours a day, averaging twelve a day. 

I'm up by 5:00 AM, showered, and out the door by 6:30ish to drive to the Ferry, which is twenty minutes away. The ferry is free going to Seattle. But I have to pay $14 a day for parking. Boat departs at 7:05 (usually, if they're on time.), in Seattle by 7:40ish. Walk about twenty minutes to work. I always plan to be on the property an hour before I have to clock in, because sometimes traffic is slow, or a boat is missed/late. I never want to be in a position where I'm late. 

Clock in at nine, work until anywhere from 9PM-11 PM. Usually we get out around 10:30. I usually miss the 10:55 boat back home, so I'm stuck waiting for the next one- at 12:15AM. Get back at 12:15, and usually make it home at 1:15 AM. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Sometimes we have ""clopens,"" Which are shifts where we close at 10:30PM, and we're in the next morning by 7AM. So, those days, I'm on a ferry at 5:20 AM. Up typically at 3:45 to make sure I can shower and so on.

So, averaging around an hour an fifteen minutes each way.

It's hard, but I've gotten used to it. In this coming March I'm moving us closer to Seattle, so that I have to drive at most 30 minutes to and from work. I average about $400 a month in commuting. I'll cut the time and cost to pretty much a third of what it is now, and have some money to designate for rent, babysitters, or other bills."

Edgar_Allan_Rich,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1389978794.0,"You are experiencing what I like to call ""Guitar Center Butthole"". You bought into the hype of $80 shit speakers and you got fucked. You're expecting to achieve pro-level mix quality with no skills and sub-crappy equipment, most likely in a bedroom environment. Awesome. It's okay. That's how we learn. My first suggestion would be to quit being such a sucker and start accepting the fact that that's not going to happen. To answer your questions:

1) We can't answer that question. But I will say that if you don't know why you are using a subwoofer then you shouldn't be using a subwoofer. Plus, I'm predicting that you're in a crappy room so a sub will be completely useless. In fact, both a sub and your ""monitors"" are probably adding more problems than they are solving if I had to guess.

2) Only listen at high volumes when you want to make sure it sounds good at high volumes. If you want to blow your ears out, be our guest. Generally speaking it's easier to get balanced mixes at very low levels due to the way we perceive the frequency spectrum. Also, we have no idea if it has anything to do with compression. We can't hear it and you've given us no details about your signal chain. We aren't mind readers.

3) Yes. Destroy those shit speakers with a hammer and buy flat speakers. Then build a proper mixing environment to put them in. This should cost you somewhere in the $25k-100k range to get started. Until you have that kind of money, read up on acoustics and learn how to compensate for your facility's shortcomings. Very good mixes can come from crappy equipment if you understand how to use acoustics and perception to your advantage.

The entire time.

&gt;As to your comment that he was breathing well, that is just a straight up lie. Both paramedics who gave testimony said that he needed assistance to breath. He needed the bag to help breath. Maybe he was not in a coma but he most certainly not ""breathing fine"" as well.

They both said he was breathing on his own when he was put into the ambulance.   It was not until about 6 minutes into the trip it became an issue.  What the hell happened during the trip.  Sounds like the paramedic FUCKED up.  It is also amazing how this guys story keeps changing.  From he didn't need assistance to we reacted slow because cops told us to and he was almost dead.  Sounds like he is covering his ass.

Witnesses to the event back the police story of events as does the video.

&gt;Yea the cop hit his leg. The cop did not ""just hit his"" leg. That was unjustified force.

He was running away from them...  How was that unjustified?  For fucks sake are cops just supposed to let people walk away when they are being arrested?  Sorry I can not risk hurting you.

Now, imagine that sentiment came from your own mommy. Mommy, the person who should love you and protect you and defend you and teach you and help you. MOMMY DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

Holy shit. Holy. Fucking. Shit.

That's going to stick with you. Every time she smiles at you, you're going to have the knowledge that Mommy doesn't like you looping in your mind on repeat. Every time she doesn't keep a promise, it's because she doesn't like you. Every time anything happens, you know it's through the filter of someone who doesn't like you. Every interaction is tainted with it.

You might forget that she flat out said the words, but the feeling of ""My own mom doesn't like me, who else ever will?"" is going to fuck you up. It's going to fuck up your confidence with other people. You'll never know who your genuine friends are. If that guy/girl REALLY likes you or is just fucking with you.

I think my mom was strict when I was a little kid - I wasn't allowed to play video games unless it was the weekend and I couldn't go out to play with the other kids until I finished my homework and piano. 

But as I grew older, my mom became more weird and crazy and less strict. As long as I kept my grades up, she didn't care how long I stayed out with my friends. She went through a stint where she drank vinegar because she read that it was good for you in the Chinese newspaper. When I brought back the aforementioned girl to Thanksgiving dinner (for the first time ever), my mom gave her a hug and said: ""I always wanted another daughter"". She's absolutely convinced that I'm fat and that if I lose weight I'll be able to get a girlfriend. I'm a shade over 200 lbs and I'm six and a half feet tall (*read: I'M NOT FAT*). She wants to redo my entire wardrobe and buy me skinny jeans and wants to cut my hair to look like a Korean pop star.

""Oh god, YES! Suck it, bitch.""

There are a few rules I live by - *the first is to gather all the information as possible.* The others I'll get to in a moment.

I start recording the call. I've heard that voice before... not Celeste's, his. So, this guy is someone that we both know, that narrows it down to about 100 people - wait, 40 people who are male.

One of her ex's? Unlikely, they live at least three states away. A quick Facebook check shows that he last 4 ex's are either working (or should be) about 300 miles away. Therefore, it has to be someone I know. Someone who would betray me...

""Oh yeah, bend me over the couch.""

Jack? No, he may be married and boring, but he's also committed. Colin? Possibly, doesn't like me after I pointed out his girlfriend still had a drug problem. Still, he spent a fair amount on rehab and couples therapy; seems foolish to waste such an investment. I need more info.

""Oh fuck, yes! Fuck me on the desk!""

Bingo.

Only three guys I know have sofas and desks in the same room. A quick call from the house phone should expose them.

I call David. The phone rings. ""Hello, David Carradine speaking!"" I hang up. Not him.

I call Jason. The phone rings...and rings...and voicemail. He's a suspect.

I call Phil. The phone rings...and then, on my cell, I hear ""Wake Me Up"" by Avicci.

I hang up the home phone. The song stops. I hang up my cell.

I've got them.

*Rule 2 - identify their strengths and weaknesses.*

Phil is a former All-American, continuing life in a menial job of which he has little skill for real work. His spinal injury made sure of that. And now, he's fucking Celeste. So, the info I have is:

* Disillusion.
* Spinal injury.
* Infidelity.

First, I contact his boss; inform him why he's not at his job (it's not ""the flu,"" apparently.) The boss thanks me, informing me he'll be fired when/if he comes into work tomorrow. Secondly, I contact his doctor and physiotherapist - they were very interested to hear he was doing ""heavy lifting."" I doubt that will be good news for his medical insurance. Finally, I contact his girlfriend at work. Luckily, the recording does marvels to convince people. I could only just imagine her balling her eyes out at her desk, while her ""Philly-Bear"" wasn't resting up in bed.

*And rule 3 - Give them Nothing.*

I could have trashed Celeste's room, burned her clothes, etc. But that's petty, and simple. No, I pack my things quickly into my suitcase and leave a note of how I found out, but not before I take the one thing she knows will hit her right in the heart:

Her grandmother's holocaust ring.

She always said she wanted to wear it as a wedding ring. I always wanted to marry her. Guess we won't get what we want. I pocket it and leave.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It took her nearly a month after I left to realise it was gone. I get a call from her, the only time she has called me.

""I swear to God, if I come looking for you, Phil's gonna beat the shit out of you and leave you to die on the roadside.""

I pause. She hasn't a clue where I am. No-one does.

""Well? Got anything to say?""

I hold the phone close and say only one word:

"" ***'If.'*** ""

I hang up, block her, Phil's and anyone else who would side with them's number. Besides, a ring like that is worth a lot - and I have a flight to Paris booked.

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389979738.0,"As has already been said, this is a tremendously broad question.  However, there are a couple important points to frame the discussion:

1. After most of the Jewish population of Europe was killed, the survivors didn't form a majority of the Jewish community.  No significant Jewish community had a majority of Holocaust survivors in its founder population.
* The majority of the Jewish population immediately after the war was in the US or the Middle East (particularly Iraq and Palestine, but many countries had large Jewish populations), which weren't affected economically the way Europe was (i.e. assets weren't seized).  This changed a few years later in the Middle East, but that's later on.

Anyway, post-war the survivors were often quite poor.  They were essentially left with nothing, their assets seized, homes taken over by others or destroyed, etc. A significant number were living in DP camps as refugees, without much property of any kind.  That said, I don't know of any economic analysis of Holocaust survivors immidiately post-war.  One really isn't possible without hard numbers on basic questions like ""how many Holocaust survivors were there"" (which is hugely uncertain, not only because there aren't hard demographic numbers of refugees in general, but also because there's no universal definition of ""Holocaust survivor""), which precludes even making a serious attempt."

But since nobody likes those answers here, You have to record enable more than one PT track in order to record more than one signal at a time. Of course you're only going to be able to record as many signals as your mbox offers, which is probably, what, one? Two at a time? Again, read the manual.

And PTE is crippled so it only lets you use 16 tracks at a time if I recall, which is lame as hell. You may want to invest in a small mixer so you can bounce tracks down as they go into the mbox."

metamongoose,AskWomen,1389979783.0,"I'm a man, so this question isn't directed at me. However, I would like to answer as the way you asked the question contains all of the answers you are looking for. So let me answer with quotes from your question, and explanations.

&gt;I know ALL of you have this problem! :) 

is the first sign that you think women are objects of beauty.

&gt;You have what other women might want or desire

You don't go so far as to say that other woman ALL want or desire your looks, but you're close.

&gt;I can't feel sorry for the woman who is ""too"" beautiful/gorgeous/sexy/hot/whatever.

Third quote. Not a single sign that you think women have individual needs, personalities, or reactions to attention.

You ask a question about women complaining about being beautiful. Have you ever heard a woman complain about being beautiful? Or have you actually heard women complain about the **consequences** of that beauty? The unwarranted attention. The total disregard for their inner person by everyone that sees them. The feeling that they are filling the role of an object of beauty when actually they want to be seen as a person first, and not a pretty object.

Your analogy with the powerball winner hits home this disregard. In that scenario, you have the powerball winner complaining about the consequences of their win. Not the win itself, but how it has affected their life in negative ways.

We all judge on appearance. But if you can't see that being stunningly beautiful can cause problems for women then you really need to examine your own attitudes."

Renner1,worldpolitics,1389979833.0,"Not at all an expert, but I would think that what led to the increased level of sectarianism in Iraq was rather more complicated then the Americans invading and deposing Saddam-- not saying that they went about doing that the right way, because they severely screwed it up.

The fact is that Al Qaeda and other takfirist elements effectively followed America into Iraq, and were able to gain ground when things started going to pieces and the Americans, for the most part, stood around dithering or making excuses.

Obviously Zakaria's not saying this-- but those who claim that Saddam was the only person who was able to stop the Iraqis from collectively tearing each other's throats out for sectarian reasons are full of shit.

Not least because people who really hate each other don't associate with one another even if they're pacified-- and many accounts of life in Iraq show a larger sense of interfaith and intersect community-- people of different sects and religions as friends with one another, associating with one another, families of different background marrying into each other, people doing all sorts of things together.

Personally, I think it doesn't really matter how dope a shirt is if it doesn't fit correctly. All I can see is how a shirt a size too big adds at least 20pounds in looks. It's awful. I just look like someone pulled a potato bag over me."

(Which is IMO one of the best examples of how to bring someone back from the dead and not have it be absolutely cringeworthy).  If anyone did anything to sully or otherwise taint the image of his creation, I'm sure he'd probably go full Alan Moore on them.  He seems pretty happy over at Image right now doing his own thing, so I don't think he'd hold back just to save face, he was also cited as praising the script some time ago.

Initially, as your planet is consumed, your biggest danger (I mean, these are the last few minutes of your life, so everything is relative here) isn't actually Galactus's digestive processes, but the seismic effects of his consumption.  The tectonic plates you're standing on will start vibrating and breaking apart while at the same time the thin veil of atmosphere that separates you from the void will begin to very rapidly destabilize.  There is a real chance you'll die of exposure, asphyxiation or of blunt trauma from some flying debris before ever getting near the big guys molars.  

Now, lets say you're very very very unlucky (perhaps in an aircraft in the direct path of his consumption) and you get pulled into his gaping maw - things will be weird for about 10 seconds and then you'll be exposed to what equates to a high energy reactor.  You'll burn (albeit very quickly) as the raw materials you're made of are digested.  

If Big, Purple and Ugly seems to be taking his time, give the Fantastic 4 a call.  Reed Richards LOVES getting up in Galactus's grill and they might just be able to save your little ball of dirt.  Otherwise - uh...try to give that bastard some space indigestion.

We'd tried to have sex in the room a few times while he was out, but he always seemed to come barging into the apartment just as we got our clothes off.

I got a text from my gf saying that this was happening tonight. So I went to the roommate and told him that I needed the room for a few hours. First time I was able to approach him beforehand about this. He gives me this deer in the headlights look. ""but I have to study,"" he says. I suggest that we live in a college campus, and the library is open. I'm trying to sympathize, but he gets so indignant about the thought of being asked to leave that it ends with him packing his thins and storming off, shouting about how I was going to move out and ditch him (happened with his old roommate, now I know why).

Major buzzkill, but my gf is still horny, so we give him the room and look for a new place. We end up getting my car and driving to the top of the campus parking garage.

Renner1,canada,1389981212.0,"&gt;  let's not jump to calling people racists, when they want to talk about their concerns of beliefs that support oppression.

Apart from the guy being an EDL supporter (so a supporter of drunken retards who are massively overgeneralizing and are unashamedly racist) and he's also extremely vague about what he wants to address, because he wants to say ""All Muslims in Canada are these guys and are complicit in this sort of behaviour"".

That's my main point. 

We should address this sort of thing, but we should be rational about it. Assuming both cases are Muslim, then the overwhelming likelihood is that they are extremely conservative-- possibly Salafi (although there are some Salafi who don't act like complete dopes, they are pretty guilty of it as far as this sort of thing is concerned) or otherwise affiliated with very conservative Sunnis. 

Martial arts guy is almost certainly affiliated with conservative Islamist-minded people, or maybe Salafi-inspired Islamists.

&gt; reading of his argument was ""I'm concerned about this issue and people keep calling me a racist.""

He reads like some jackass who either has an agenda of saying ""(every)Muslim in Canada is the worst sort of obscene ultra conservative and shouldn't be here"" and that ""Islam is inherently dangerous and will always be the very worst in terms of social regression and is an active threat"".

You can say that realistically of the Salafi Jihadis, or conservative Islamists who want a strict and very literalistic version of Islam to dominate every aspect of society, but that's not what this guy is doing.

Yet again-- if you associate with people who are racists-- if you defend an organization that is very racist, as the EDL is-- then the odds are that's what you'll end up looking like as well.
All I see is repeated bleating of ""Islam is not a race""-- which is, essentially, tired copypasta used by the far right whenever they actually say something that is racist about ethnic groups that largely associate with Islam of some variety."
selsewon,StarWars,1389981213.0,"SW loves to repeat the same formula with respect to the main character. Someone with raw power struggles to refine it and ultimately ends up on the light side of the force. I really don't need to see Skywalker kids doing the same. exact. thing.

I would argue that putting a ""gray"" character at the focal point would make a much more interesting plot line. Someone that walks the line the entire film(s). This could most easily be applied to a spin-off like Boba Fett than it would to a Jedi. Disney, after all, needs a clear cut good guy for merchandising. 

I think it would be great to create a reason to believe Boba Fett was actually a good guy that was working strongly with dark forces because he was trapped into a lifestyle like that. We need dimension to his character if he is going to have his own solo film. He can't simply be blowing shit up and capturing people for bounties for 90 minutes. Disney wouldn't allow that anyway. Unless there was an underlying reason which was more noble.

Make him tragic. Using his dirty money income to fund a noble cause and acting as a double agent of sorts. Shit, you could even make his reason for being so cozy with the empire was not just the money, but also because he could have been leaking Empire information to Bothans to help rebels. Maybe he gets caught and has to go on the run - only to find his old rumored connection with Han Solo pays off in the form of Solo convincing him that he should work for the Rebels.

For me there have been several moments where it felt like I was racing with my IRL club friends when it was just their Drivatar. To give examples: /u/korko 's Drivatar will get a good start, slow in the middle of the race, then charge for the finish; all while following a hard line. Just like he does IRL. /u/tylargh Defends hard and races clean, just like IRL. Additionally, while it seems like Drivatars are defaulted to back off once passed, I have had some decent back and forth fights with some.

Keep in mind that most people don't have a high Drivatar sync yet. Molding a Drivatar is less like learning something from scratch and more like molding a form from a simple block. The game has a ""default"" racing line/style, and then it takes note of your own habits. Over time these start to manifest in your Drivatar.

What I don't know is how the difficulty level of the Drivatar setting changes Drivatar behavior. "

Which in itself isn't an endorsement of any ham-fisted, moronic American ""liberation"" action, nor is it to say that Iraqi society during the 1980s was worse then the imposed-by-force Khomeinist theocracy in Iran-- Iraq had a far better situation in a lot of ways, but I wouldn't endorse the ""too bad they couldn't both lose"" idea that some had espoused in regard to that specific conflict.

My own take on this is - what do you mean ""noone around to hear it"", there's a whole forest. In order for there to be a ""sound"", there need to be a perceiver of sounds. I consider our particular consciousness to be a mechanism that translates the sensory information of the vibrations in air pressure, and this pattern is reflected in our conscious experience. 

If there are no ""hearing"" consciousnesses around, the forest is still exposed to the pattern. Maybe it will be mirrored in other consciousnesses in a different way, I don't know.

In my view, consciousness is rooted in the physical system of the universe, somehow. Therefore consciousness entails physical existence, but I think there is no logical demand that a physical existence entails consciousness.

vallary,knitting,1389982198.0,"5-6 projects actually sounds like a comfortable number to me, because I have the same problem as you, only apparently way way worse. 

Anyway, my suggestions for paring down are:

Decide what you think a comfortable number of projects is for you and try to stay within that limit. Factor in what different environments you like to knit in, and if you feel strained by working with certain sizes of needles. Also keep in mind that you have a finite amount of time you can spend knitting, so the more projects you put into that time affects how long it takes for all of them to be completed. (I'd really recommend choosing a medium size project and forcing yourself to knit only that until it's complete to give yourself a wake-up call on how quickly you can finish one thing. I knit 164 repeats of [this pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/thayer) in ten days and was completely shocked at what life could be like if I was only more focused.)

Try not to let yourself cast on two similar projects. If you're casting on a second sweater/blanket/hat, it should be very different than the first, like one is very simple so you can work on it while you're socializing/paying attention to a movie and the other is more complicated to you work on it when you can pay more attention. 

Plan ahead! Think about (realistically) how long a project is going to take to complete, and if you are going to need your FO at that time. I'm really, really bad for starting a new thing that I want to wear RIGHT NOW, without factoring in that it won't be weather-appropriate when I finish it. (Which basically means I will be like ""oh, it's too cold/hot to wear this sweater now"" and toss it into hibernation only needing 1/2 a sleeve and button bands to be complete and start something that is more seasonally appropriate. I need an intervention.)

Set deadlines! Join knit-alongs if you need some additional motivation to keep on-task. (This can be tricky for the in-progress stuff you're trying to clear out, but will hopefully keep you on-task for new stuff you're starting. Sometimes there's a 'FINISH ALL THE THINGS' weekend in this sub, but it's always on an American long weekend and I have to do things like go to work instead of knitting.)

I agree, and I don't think dogecoins are immune, but I think they're off to the best start of any leading cryptocoin.

Each coin that comes up seems to solve the problem of the previous. Bitcoin solved the initial problem. Litecoin raised the limit. Dogecoin focuses on creating an economy. If we see all three fail due to speculation, then the next coin will hopefully find ways to mitigate that."
AdmiralRychard,arduino,1389982207.0,"I wonder...

It says they're using a potentiometer on the device to set the temperature.

If you change the temperature via the web interface, how do future changes to the temperature (via turning the potentiometer) take place considering the value on the potentiometer is set to the old value?

Ex:

* The potentiometer is set to some value that signifies 72°F

* The temperature is changed to 73°F via the web interface.
* The position of the potentiometer is set to 72°F but the software says 73°F.

If you did this exact process a number of times, eventually the potentiometer would be set such that the decreasing the temperature value to 72°F would require you to turn the potentiometer past its lower range, which seems as though it wouldn't be possible.  You'd have to do the opposite to fix it; setting the temperature on the web interface to a lower temperature than it is set to currently and then turn the temperature back up on the device physically. 

**Edit:** It appears that the value for the potentiometer overrides the value set via the web interface.  It seems like if the temperature changes were drastic enough, it would act somewhat odd to a user adjusting the physical device where the temperature on the display would jump back to what the potentiometer says it should be rather than increasing/decreasing the value that was already set.

I think you're writing your own narrative here, and not letting reality get in the way. You leave no space for doubt in anything you say about her, eg ""she still feels like I am the only person who understands her, and the only person who she could see herself having sex with""

I imagine she told you that in conversation. From the tone of your post, I imagine you steered that conversation.

""when she is cruel it is because she is nervous and hiding weakness"" this is a dangerous path. You have elevated her to the status of Love Of Your Life, and can forgive everything that she does so that she keeps that status. Bring her down a peg, realise she has flaws and you have flaws and your relationship had flaws and that doesn't matter as you'll find someone else somewhere down the line!

&gt;""DTP is the training system that has transformed the physiques of many people and can do the same for you as well. DTP targets both the fast twitch and slow twitch muscle fibers in order to both enhance and define your muscle. It provides an overflow of nutrient rich blood to the muscle group you are training to provide a fuller appearance and more separation to the physique, at the same time increasing the heart rate and the intensity to burn fat and build muscle as well.""

I also watched A LOT of tutorials on YouTube. Search for Lillith Moon, she does lots of hair tutorials and I find the way she explains it pretty easy to follow. 

If you have a day where you're just going to be hanging around the house, practice braiding or whatever else you want to do. 

One easy style I like to do when I don't have a lot of time is a sort of easier variation of a French wraparound braid. 

* Start on whatever side you part your hair on. 
* Separate two small strands of hair. 
* Twist one strand over the other. 
* Collect a bit of hair to add to the top strand and twist it over the bottom. 
* repeat all the way around the back of your head. Adding some more hair to the top strand each time. 
* When you get around to the other side of your head, you can either put your hair in a low ponytail or messy side bun.

&gt; if done properly can educate some of the playerbase on how this crime really can mess people up psychologically

Will nobody think about the poor little rapists and their untold stories!!!! *tiniest violin sound*

Personally, I'm pretty over games being so in love with playing as hyper asshole antiheroes (note: there is a difference between a game giving you the choice to be like that and it being part of the fixed storyline that you have to be like that) regardless of whether the scene was rapey or not. 

I believe another popular complaint is stories using rape scenes to make something ALL ABOUT THE GUY again (oh noes, my girlfriend got threatened with rape, now let me angst about that; or oh noes, I raped/almost raped somebody, feel sorry for meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! (rather than about the victim and her family who never get mentioned again =&gt; but you are right, we obviously have so many millions of games that show a realistic portrayal of rape recovery, that's like getting old, we should totally spice it up by telling it from the perspective of not-the-victim because obviously their POV is completely already covered and overrepresented and super-frequent in video games already /sarcasm)). 

Personally, I never get the hubhub about ""zomg can you use rape as a story element in video games"" when people, [it has been done](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0RuBNcYX9o) ages ago, in a main stream-ish game, created by one of the most important female video game creators, Roberta Williams. So why are we acting like it's omg, so daring/treading new ground? To me that's the most bullshit aspect of the entire conversation to me.

The ""him"" here is Joseph Smith, which, according to D&amp;C 132 is the *only person on Earth* who can perform this ordinance. This is not one of those ""delegation type"" situations.

Using overheat timing, I'll get most of the fuel used from the bottom two SRBs and the top SRB will be used as a ""kerbal-engineered"" decoupler.

If you can squeeze in another set of 6 radial SRBs done the same way, do that too for more lift.

If you find yourself spinning too much due to the SRBs being a bit wobbly, then stack more empty command modules on top of them for the extra SAS power.

It's great in token builds, and though I usually like swapping in a new card with an effect similar to an old card, tokens needs all of the support it can get from me.

Current Creature 3-drops at 450 in White:

* Transcendent Master (foil)
* Flickerwisp
* Blade Splicer
* Silverblade Paladin
* Fiend Hunter
* Mirror Entity

Mirror Entity and Blade Splicer are definitely staying, they are too powerful / efficient. Flickerwisp is versatile and still a 3 power flyer for 3, so I'd prefer to keep it (I also really like blink subthemes in cube). This leaves Paladin, Master, and Hunter.

Silverblade Paladin has both wrecked and wiffed in my cube. Fiend Hunter is pretty much always useful (though I don't really have ways to abuse his triggers at instant speed). I have seen people play it on their own creatures though then wrath the next turn, which I thought was cool. I've also seen people play it on a Grave Titan and had the hunter killed that same turn. Transcendent Master either wins the game by himself or gets you potentially Time Walked or 2x Time Walked if he dies before hitting indestructible and your opponent can predict where you spend your mana. He's a great top-deck late game though, and still a 3/3 for 3 in the early game, but it always makes me cry when he gets Doom Bladed at level 11.

If I'm being honest with myself, it's Transcendent Master that gets the cut pretty easily. I love him foil (I pulled him) but I've been cycling out most of the worse level-up creatures (Guul-Draz Assassin, Kargan Dragonlord) and he was next to get the axe. His time has finally run out.

tsaven,lostgeneration,1389984055.0,"This is extremely true; the subjects are incredibly difficult and most critically *you can't bullshit your way through them* (as easily).

A huge amount of liberal arts majors (especially English and the grand-daddy of useless degrees, Philosophy) are graded and judged on more ""squishy"" aspects; how well you crafted an argument, how well you presented ideas, how well you were able to compare and contrast two ideals or events.  And while all of those things are important and useful skills (Hell, I'm using them right now), they are by their nature quite fuzzy and difficult to objectively evaluate.  Things are not judged as much in a context of ""correct"" vs ""incorrect"", much of the judgement of their merit will lay in the opinions of the observer.

Many engineering subjects, by contrast, are *very explicit* in terms of what is a success or failure.  Your assignment was to build an autonomous robot that navigated a maze; did it accomplish that task?  Your assignment is to build a structure that will support a load of *x*; did it support it, or did it collapse?  Your assignment is to create a chemical substance that will withstand solvents *x* and *y* but be dissolved by *z*; does your substance accomplish that task?

This binary measurement of success or failure, correct vs incorrect, means that you can't as easily bullshit your way through them.  By contrast, the squishy nature of many Liberal Arts majors is ripe for bullshit artists to muddle their way though and emerge with very little in the way of actual skills.  If you don't have a solid grasp of the concepts required for most engineering subjects, it's going to show and no amount of arguing or rationalizing to the professor is going to change the fact that your doohicky didn't accomplish the task that was set before it.

In reality, this far more closely resembles the way the world actually works; that what matters isn't what you think or who you are, but *what you can do*.  ""A tree is judged not by it's soil or bark, but by the quality of the fruit it produces""."

So you try your hand at adventuring. You start small. Maybe steal a sword from a blacksmith and start hacking at the huge crabs down by the water. Then you start hunting animals. Eventually you make enough gold to buy some cheap armor.

Now, you think, the real adventures begin. You check out some nearby ruins. What luck! A huge emerald! 

But then, when you grab it, the fucking corpses come to life! Fuck! They look a lot stronger than you. Then one *yells* and knocks you on your ass.

Fuck this, you think, so you run. You make it out, but when you turn to close the door, a stray arrow hits your leg. 

Door closed, you hike back to town, limping and in excruciating pain. You wonder if you severed your ACL. Then you black out.

You wake up in a guard tower infirmary. Leg bandaged and splinted. Eventually it heals, but you always limp. The guard hires you to stand watch by the gate. It's not a bad job, just lonely.

Then one day a guy comes in, shining armor, magic sword. Covered in blood. This guy has the life you always wanted. So you try to start a conversation, show him you are a kindred spirit. Maybe make a friend finally.

aDDnTN,personalfinance,1389984493.0,"mine is not one of those roll over plans. my wife's is though, but she's a teacher. which is odd because both our pensions are in Tennessee Consolidated Retirement, but mine has $0 cash value and her's is like an 401k that she can't touch, until she rolls it into something else after leaving. and mine is definitely more money right now.

Of 100% total for retirement at this point, 70% is in those TCR pensions and 30% is 401k/457/IRA. i'm definitely hoping to get some good years in and change that around. In any case, my target retirement amount outside of pensions will be sufficient for us to subside on (as long as the whole ""healthcare"" situation/debacle gets resolved), based on 3% inflation and 6% growth, which most would agree is on the pessimistic side of things.

Also, we are both SS applicable *currently*, but neither of us has EVER planned on that being around. I'm 32 and have contributed since i was 15, so that's 17 years of SS going straight to all those ""entitled"" boomers. To bad they planned to never leave anything for us to have left over..

theoccassional,Fitness,1389984885.0,"As others have mentioned, check in with him regularly on the whys and hows of what to do. The trainer should be constantly addressing your form with encouragement or corrections. You want to be sure that the trainer is with you and focused solely on you during your session. This isn't rude ir arrogant, it is specifically what you are paying for.A trainer should be giving you advice and forming/maintaining programs for you. Although there a plenty of routines out there like SS, a trainer should be designing a program specific to you based upon his/her observations during your session. Trainers are supposed to place in activities that encourage progress and address weaknesses with healthy practice. If you are given what looks like a form letter for your program, ask questions about why this, why that, why this order. It is good to know and you want your trainer to be aware of your interest in working out right and regularly. On that point, be sure to let your trainer know your goals as much as possible and update him/her as your interests shift. Often times good trainers get bogged down with their job and many people that go to trainers are older, quite unfit people that kill their excitement about their job. Try to be a client that gets them excited by being interested, working your ass of during the session, and working out regularly when you are not scheduled.TL;DR Be informed of the whys and hows of your program, hold the trainer accountable, be a good client to encourage the trainer to go above and beyond with you."

They are not concerned with religion, just making sure you have no convictions for crimes, especially involving children.  I had to get one done to be able to volunteer at my wife school.

A request for references in this case is also normal, the school is being extra cautious.  If you turned out to be a hidden pedophile and did something to a child the school would also be named in the law suite and since they would have deeper pockets...they would end up paying.  If they do thier research and prove they did everything a reasonable person would they can mitigate or negate those problems.  Also it is better for mediReferences can provide information that might not appear on a background check.  Like maybe they would disclose something that was swept under the rug.

Assuming you have no nasty convictions and your references are good you will have no problems.

If you can handle the fallout from looking like a sloppy, careless idiot-- both sexes-- then it's less of a problem. If you can acknowledge that you drank too much or did something you though was fine at the time, but now regret, and act in a respectable, responsible fashion, then that's commendable.

I should state that the ""rape culture"" promoters are pretty thin on the ground, all things considered. Same with the ""slut walkers"".

I'm assuming you're a bit on the bigger side. Out of shape, dress masculine/non-flattering/whatever - just not feminine. Incorrigible flirt in real life too. If you weren't, Men wouldn't be a problem at all.

I'm about to change your life in 3 easy steps.

You ready?

Peep.

1. **Be fit &amp; eat healthy everyday from now on.** Stop avoiding this. Get into good shape which is what attracts us, and eat healthy which will benefit your hair, skin, nails, energy/sex, etc etc etc - you'll be more feminine and feel like a million bucks. You'll want to do awesome activities, you'll want to travel. Your new body will make you want to show it off, and you will start dressing more feminine AKA more sexy. The fuck are you waiting for.

2. **Be forgiving**. Don't snipe behind anyone's back, ever. 


3. **Don't be a foul slut.** All that flirting, the attention &amp; validation seeking, the meaningless hookups etc - stop all that. As you become a better quality girl, you'll start to attract better quality guys **automatically**. Learn how to NOT give the thirsty betas any attention at all (fuck being polite), pick a decent Man you feel is best out of all of them and devout your soul to him. Assuming you hit all these points, he will naturally settle with you and you'll live happily ever after.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389985170.0,"&gt;I mean to ask was Germany really ahead of its time during the wwII technologically speaking?

Not exactly.  Germany after WW1 was forcibly demobilized.  In 1933 when the Nazi's came to power they had a pitifully small army.  Even in 1936 when they 'reoccupied the rhineland' they were in no position to fight anyone.   In 1939 they rolled over poland - and of course they did so with mostly brand new equipment.  While in many cases they had less  equipment, what they did have was new, innovative and well maintained.  The allies on the other hand were using a collection of equipment, some of which was 20 + years old at that point.  A lot of British and French tank crews didn't  have radios for example.  These aren't all that expensive to add, but no one got around to it when the war started. 

Germany is and was the largest country in western europe - they had about 60 million people compared to France and Britain at about 40 million each.  Add to germanies total Austria, then an Alliance with Italy, Romania, Hungary etc. and the Axis controlled quite a lot of power in Europe.  France had also suffered the worst demographic disaster of anyone in WW1, so they were a country of 40 million people fighting like a country of 25 million kind of thing.  

When the germans started fighting they did so in a somewhat methodical piecewise destruction of their enemies.  First Poland, then Denmark and Norway, then the netherlands and belgium, then France.  Had they tried to take on everyone at once things would have been a tad more difficult, but germany basically held a tiny little defensive strip against france while it  destroyed  poland, then swung the whole army round the other way.  Essentially every country you capture adds something to your overall capabilities.  The Nazi Empire was certainly a match for say the Soviets or the US or the UK alone.  

The italians were actually quite a serious problem at sea to the Allies.   

Then the Nazi's made  their big mistake - they left the British empire in tact and then attacked the Soviet Union.  The Soviets broadly expected an attack but were not prepared for the size and scope of what hit them.  But the Soviet union was huge, with a lot of people.  And they were getting supplies from the UK and US.  And while the Nazi Empire and its allies in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Itally were strong, the UK and the Soviet Union (and the soviet Winter) were stronger.  Then the Americans joined the war and the Nazi's had basically no chance.  Japan was fighting over colonial assets that could be mostly abandoned while Germany was being dealt with, and by the time Japan joined the war most of the serious Naval assets of Germany and Italy were gone (not all of them) so the major Naval construction by the allies could be mostly dedicated to fighting the Japanese.  Who themselves were bogged down in a land war in China.

Technically this could never count as fair use because he's still using someone else's songs as the source material. No matter how much you chop it up, if they find you sampled Thriller for a track, they can go after you for it.

Plenty of producers chop up samples to the point that you couldn't recognize the source material though. That's one way they get around paying ridiculous fees to use the samples. DJ Shadow is probably the biggest name I can think of that did that. Most of the time the original artist or label will never know. It's the risk you have to take when making this kind of stuff.

This is true especially given that my family has 0 family history of heart attacks and all of my grandparents have survived to 80+ without issue so on a personal level it makes sense that I have a gun more than a defibrillator. 

All I am saying is that it shouldn't be a law that you are forced to rely on the government service and you should be legally allowed to prepare for problems. If the government disarms me they will be forcing me to place my life in the police response time to my house if a guy larger than I can handle enters my house and threatens me just like it would be insane for the government to ban private ownership of epipens and defibrillators as it would force people with allergies to place their life in the hands of ambulances."

scottious,getdisciplined,1389985785.0,"Well I think it's important to realize that lack of action is the most sure-fire way to fail.  I relate to having anxiety about people being better than you, and that's understandable... we all compare ourselves to everybody else.

However, it's self-defeating to give up because it seems like you're worse than other people.  Giving up will make you **never** able to succeed.  Trying hard and failing along the way will make you succeed eventually (and trust me, with enough gumption, you WILL succeed).

Change needs to come from within though.  No words that I type or anything that anybody says will ever make lasting change within yourself.  Only you can unlock that power.

So the decision is yours.  Will you give up and wallow in self-pity about people being better than you?  Or will you get up after being knocked down and not let yourself ever say ""I can't"" again?"

Assuming an even distribution between the 1-hour lunch break warriors and the 8-hour streamers, that's 5 hours per player. 100,000 hours played.

Assume half of them are too low level to get exalt drops, so 50,000 hours of exalt farming.

&gt;EDIT: Y'all are right, you can get exalts in Twilight Strand. However, at low levels your kill speed is low (if not nonexistent due to running past mobs to get to Ledge/Fellshrine/etc), so you're not going to get the number of exalts per hour like you would from dedicated farming.

There are some minor differences in these makeups that are going to remain pronounced. However, in general, there are probably some things you can do about it. Don't simply assure yourself that you are doing everything right and look for miracle cures. Put away your current notes and figures, get a clean notebook, and recalculate everything from scratch. Don't fudge or estimate; be precise and honest. Perhaps find a friend that can do some of the paperwork themselves or look over your work to be sure that you aren't missing something because of the routine that it has become for you to breeze through these calculations.Finally, I know foe myself that moons are the hardest thing to get rid of.

MaeBeWeird,BabyBumps,1389986113.0,"They will come when it is time for them to. Remember, there is nothing wrong with you or baby because you are pregnant a few days longer than other pregnant ladies. It isnt an exact thing and when you think about it, the fact that the window baby is most likely to come in is only 28 days wide is actually quite amazing, there is only 28 possible days your baby is most likely to come.

And since you have already gone through 21 of those days, you only have 7 possible days left. Your baby could literally be here any day now, it is all a matter of when it is their birthday. It just happens to not be yet.

Dont feel bad about crying. I cried the last few weeks of mine too.

Dont worry about babys size. Unless theres something else going on (uncontrolled diabetes, fused pelvis, malposition, or other issues like this which generally cause a problem no matter how pregnant you are), your body isnt gonna grow a baby it cant push out. 

Personally, i have given birth (vaginally) at 41w6d and 42w on the nose. One was just over 7lbs, the other was just under 9lbs. The 7lber i needed a stitch. The nearly 9lber didnt tear me at all. Not even a little.

Also, dont worry about having zero signs of labor. Generally you have no signs of labor until you are in labor, it is infuriating, but that is how it goes.

Want to do something fun?

Go shopping. ""Oh! When are you due?!"" ""The 10th"" ""of February? Oh thats so soon!"" ""...no. of january.""

The closer you get to 42 weeks, the more panicked their reactions get and the faster they try to get you out of the store. It is hilarious."

bluefootedboob,dogs,1389986176.0,"The unfortunate fact is that many rescues (and many shelters) don't understand that customer service is a huge part of running a business. And while many people get offended by calling shelters and rescues a business, they are. It is a common complaint among people trying to adopt from rescues and shelters with more strict adoption policies. The people running the adoption programs don't realize how much they are hurting their reputation by not being responsive to e-mails and phone calls, and for not telling people *why* they aren't approved. They also don't consider that their lack of response is driving people to purchase pets on Craigslist or from breeders because it's so much easier.

A lot of times they just don't have the time or energy to respond to every inquiry - people working in rescue often times have families, full time jobs, and pets of their own. They're volunteering their time and hours to operate this rescue, and they fall short and don't realize how important it is to be responsive and easy to talk to. Their priority is their animals, not your feelings or your time. And so when they find the perfect home for an animal that might have already had several applications, they're going to drop it in that perfect situation and not even bother to let the rest of the people know... because in their mind their job is already done.

You also have to understand that these dogs do belong to the shelter and rescue, and while they are attempting to re-home these dogs, they actually do not have any obligation to give the pets to you. 

My recommendation is to go to an adoption event (some areas have events where lots of local shelters and rescues bring dogs for adoption) or go to a physical shelter. This way you actually get to speak to people face to face (way better than a paper or electronic application), and they get to see how you are interacting with the animals.

Also, be open and receptive as to why people may not be adopting to you. Are you using punishment and dominance based training methods? Are you gone from home more than 8-9 hours a day? Have you had a history of dogs being hit by cars or lost? Are you specifically looking for only tough/strong/scary looking dogs (that might make it seem like you are using the dog as a status symbol?) Do you plan to leave your dog outside in your fenced yard unsupervised while you're away from work? Do you have a history of adopting and returning dogs that just didn't work out? There is a myriad of reasons why a rescue group or shelter may not think you're a great home for their pets - and you do have to listen and understand why. "

thunderburd,AskMen,1389986412.0,"Hi there!  I truly appreciate that you treat victims equally.  Sadly, the majority of society does not, and this is often exacerbated or directly influenced by feminists.

The definition of rape used by the FBI and most sexual assault studies erases female perpetrators and male victims, because the definition used for ""rape"" requires the perpetrator to penetrate the victim.  Simply put, a woman forcing a man to have sex without his consent is not considered ""rape"".  This definition came from feminists (ex: the influential Mary P. Koss, but it's perpetuated by countless other feminists), and used in almost every otherwise credible study on sexual assault (see the CDC study for an example).  This allows feminists to claim that 99% of men are rapists, even though that is not the case at all (when forced-envelopment IS considered rape, we see that the crime has near gender-symmety).  Additionally, almost ALL feminist-backed anti-rape campaigns only acknowledge male perpetrators and female victims, continuing the false narrative.  I would highly recommend [this blog](http://tamenwrote.wordpress.com/), which is maintained by a male victim of rape and very clearly goes over studies and incidences of male-victim erasure.  Also, see [this](http://permutationofninjas.org/post/57003274589/gender-symmetry-in-sexual-assault-an-analysis-of-the) for an analysis of the CDC NISVS study that shows gender-symmetry in rape victims while erasing male victims by using the flawed definition above.

Similar issues exist with domestic violence.  Many feminists insist that male-against-female domestic violence occurs vastly more often than the reverse, when numerous studies have shown this to be false.  Feminists have actively fought against male domestic violence shelters and resources.  Erin Pizzey, the founder of the first women's shelter (and instrumental in many other shelters), was harassed and threatened by feminists to the point where she felt it necessary to leave her country, simply because she declared that her observation that women were just as abusive as men.  Feminists pushed for the current primary aggresor laws in the Violence Against Women Act, which instruct police to arrest the larger/taller person involved in a dispute (read: the man).  See [this article](http://www.glennsacks.com/4_feminists_myths.htm) for more specific information on studies on DV.

I understand feminists want to help women, and I fully support researching and solving gender issues (regarding men or women).  I volunteer at Planned Parenthood because I see the right to abortion as an issue unique to women and I want to help that cause.  Unfortunately, the efforts of many feminists end up hurting lots of men and perpetuate the false ""women are pure and innocent and oppressed by men, who are violent predators"" stereotype."

BullNiro,Gamecube,1389986607.0,"Yep, the GCN is in no mans land, it's the only Nintendo console (never played a Wii U) that just really didn't push any boundaries. I actually can't think of a single way in which it is innovative and you can see its legacy today.

The games to some extent make up for it but I can't remember playing any games which were on PS that I preferred on GCN. It's very much Nintendo playing within themselves, to their strengths (good exclusives, encouraging single screen multiplayer) but let's compare it to its competition:

PS2:

Of course for the Playstation there were add ons that would mean you could play VCDs but the PS2 could play DVDs, that alone gave it a sales edge, also you could use a remote with it, and it had a lot of really good 3rd party games and exclusives.

XBOX:

Pioneering online play (obviously you could go online on Playstation but it wasn't built in, don't get me started on my little ethernet adapter, though I did love warp pipe), Halo which to this generation was Goldeneye (totally changed console FPSs), and of course the built in HDD (once again, the playstation2 could also do this, but only for the Linux they put on it to get around taxes in the EU).

Ultimately Nintendo didn't realise that you can't just rely on having good games or even good exclusives. You need actual console sales to keep the proper big cross platform games in, you need features that you can sell to gamers to say ""this is why this console will be a better experience"".

They also started after Sony, so they really should have gotten a lot further in that regard by adding features.

I love my Gamecube and can think of very few negatives as a console (the c stick is not particularly good) but when you don't know which will be better in the future (remember, you can be a proper gamer without being a fanboy) you make decisions based on the kind of features I listed above.

So in my opinion it wasn't just the commercial failure that frustrated him, but also there wasn't really much room for him to expand the scope of his gamecraft."

To answer your questions:

1. It is physical and exaggerates the agony and ecstasy of the human experience in culturally relevant terms using techniques as old as Greek Theatre.

2. Because it (a) hyperbolizes sometimes ridiculous and unlikely behaviour motivations (b) the perception of some that pre-determined outcomes make for illegitimate entertainment--that because it takes on the trappings of legitimate competition, that it NEEDS to be actually legitimately competitive, (c)  in the case of the United States, besides a few marquee events, ticket prices are reasonable, (d) it has effectively replaced the travelling Circus shows as the roving family entertainment of choice that is entirely accessible and understandable by children, and thus not sophisticated

3. Storytelling through body movement, hyperbolic emotive responses. At times, graceful, almost lyrical movement. See: Lance Storm.

4. Raw power, hyper-masculinity and physicality.

5. Catch as catch can, traditional American wrestling, strong storytelling over strong style (Japanese)

6. IMO none, due mainly to the hyper-masculinity factor in pro wrestling. This is no dance style that is nearly as hyper-masculine enough to be compared to.

7. I went to wrestling school, but nothing came out it because of my limited natural athleticism.

Tokyocheesesteak,science,1389987118.0,"&gt; is ball lightning a more common phenomenon over europe than it is over US?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; the reason i am asking is that as a kid in russia i was warned that if you see a glowing fireball looking thing that is floating, stay away from it, it's ball lightning.

Seems to be. In Russia, as a kid, I've heard *plenty* of stories about ball lightning, read about it in books, listened to advice about how to handle it from grandma and mom (who saw it personally), etc. It is definitely a well-known phenomenon. Its nature is not understood but no one questions its existence.

In the US, I've never met anyone who has seen it, and most people have never even heard of it. They give me puzzled looks as I describe this lightning thing that forms a ball and travels in unpredictable ways.

Now that I think about it, if the article's proposition regarding soil content is true, it's entirely possible that Russian soil's chemical makeup, in general, is much more conducive than its American counterparts. If you've lived in both countries, you already know that the soils are very different in general. There are great reasons why Americans often keep their shoes on around the house and Russians universally take them off.

If the stories that I've heard don't lie, here's a protip I've heard repeatedly: if you see ball lightning, DON'T. MOVE. Supposedly, motion is as much of a lightning rod for it as tall places are for regular lightning. Also, they love to squeeze themselves through small openings. The ball lightning that my mom saw was a small one, as it persistently battered itself against a small crack in the window, desperately trying to get into the house as if it had a will of its own. After a short while it flew away, and next day their neighbor's bush was burnt up."

And in *most* countries, this is an *insult* because *it goddamn well is an insult to not be paid what you're worth*... 

Let me put it to you this way: If you bought a pair of shoes and the person helping you try them on expected a tip, would you do it? Fuck no. Because it is assumed *and goddamn rightly so* that they are compensated adequately for their work and it is *included* in the price of the shoes. 

I get tipping a meal service worker, but even that, in the country I'm in now, is kind of taboo. And for *good reason*... 

Frankly, this wouldn't be an issue if the US wasn't so ass-backwards in how they do things... But of course, I forgot, the USA is the center of the fucking universe and obviously anyone who criticizes it is wrong even if what they're saying makes sense...

Feminist reason to feel shame: Possibly exposing your sexual parts to someone who may not have wanted to see them in a sexually overt fashion. 

Public masturbation is frowned upon for very good reasons. It's sexual harassment to those who don't want to be exposed to that. Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. 

That said, it wasn't deliberate, which makes all the difference.

MaeBeWeird,BabyBumps,1389988939.0,"Well i dont think your doctor is overreacting sending you to a specialist.

Many things which are fine, or borderline fine, can become dangerous, or borderline dangerous in pregnancy. Another example is thyroid issues. A TSH of 4.5 will usually be shrugged off, unless you are pregnant.

This doesnt automatically mean *omg everything is bad and baby is going to have something happen!*

It means we go to a specialist to try to prevent this from happening. Which is what the high risk doctor is going to do.

Of course, i still wouldnt tell you everything will be fine and you are overreacting. Maybe she was just bad at comforting you. 

More appropriately, what should be said is:

You are taking the correct measures in this case to do the best for the health of both you and your baby and giving you both the highest chance of a healthy pregnancy by seeing a high risk doctor this early, so try to relax as much as you can until they give you a reason not to."

nomnomchikhan,TryingForABaby,1389989003.0,"I could be considered an ""all natural type,"" though without a chip on my shoulder. By that I mean there are plenty of people out there that are anti-this that and the other in a militant sort of way. For me, it's important to me to see if I can do things on my own before I decide to get medication help. For example, when I was pregnant with my first child I wanted to have a natural labor and delivery. Mostly I wanted to see if I could do it. I ended up having to be induced and having Pitocin. I did not end up getting an epidural, though if I had felt that I needed one I would have gotten it. That is what I mean by I am not anti-medication. I got medication when I felt it was necessary, but I let my body do it's thing for as long as I could. From trying to conceive standpoint I planned to take an entire year trying naturally because it's important to me to let my body do things on its own not because I think it's better that way somehow but more so just to see if I can do it. I understand that that standpoint isn't for everyone because there are different factors to consider for different people. For instance some women are older when they try to conceive, and some are not. I can understand how waiting an entire year just to see if your body can do it on its own may not be the best choice for everyone if time is not on their side.

The observable universe is defined as what we can observe - the oldest objects we can see were 13.8 billion lightyears away, 13.8 billion years ago, thus being the oldest light we could possibly see. Some of that stuff is now *way more than* 13.8 billion light years away, but we can see some of it because it was significantly closer 13.8 billion years ago.

Someday in the future, we *may* see objects further away. 13.8 (the current max) is stretching it pretty thin in terms of light extinction, which is significant - any stretch of universe 14 billion light years across is going to be full of random detritus, black holes, and stars (both heavy and bright) which make it hard to see distant light. We could only possibly get a teeny tiny fraction of the photons emitted from any object that far away. But we'll probably get some light from even further galaxies over the next few million years.

The stuff we can't see right now, we can't see for one of two reasons. First, we may not getting any light from it because of extinction (which sometimes we can bypass by looking at gravitational effects, but there's no doubt in my mind that some stuff is invisible over any timespan of decades or even centuries). The second case is its age in years is shorter than its distance from Earth in lightyears, because there's no possible way for us to see those photons."

""7: Chinese Dumplings
A popular family New Year's Eve tradition is to get together and make boiled dumplings (jiaozi). Boiled Chinese dumplings are fun and relatively easy to make, and their fried counterparts, pot stickers, are also a Western favorite. Filled with vegetables like cabbage and spring onion, and flavored with pork or shrimp, Chinese dumplings make a filling appetizer or side dish any time of year.
If you plan on following this Chinese New Year tradition, encourage everyone in the family to participate in the preparation and conceal a coin in one of the dumplings in the batch. If the person who finds it doesn't chip a tooth, he's destined to have a very, very lucky year.""

for the 2 additional ones im going to use your numbers (well rounded up) of 34$ with shipping. so that's a total of 94$ for 9 movies or 10.45$ a movie.   

thank you for finding those box sets though. i did not see them when i did my own little search. any way i think i am going to go ahead and try it out. worst case scenario i lose a little bit of money but still get a good start on my Disney movie collection.

But gravity is distortion in timespace, which is the medium through which gravity waves propagate. Could features of timespace slow down gravity propagation? Perhaps. But that's already too esoteric a statement to test. It's better to qualify though that we have no reason to believe gravity acts differently than other waves."

You don't have a lot of leverage in a negotiation that I can see.

The offer they've given you for an accelerated performance review schedule is actually really good.  

IMO you're going to need to focus on delivering results once you're in place rather than trying to get something that you've not shown you deserve.

How long does it take to reach a median salary in any given role?  I don't have hard figures, but considering the average tenure in a role before a career change is something like 8 years, then you'd expect median salary to kick in around the 4 year mark.

You'd have to be a superstar to get median salary in this economy after 1 year in role. I'm not saying it can't be done, but it would be rare. From the company's standpoint, it makes no sense to commit to giving you the median salary before you've even started.

My father had ""angry resting face"" like described here, and it just was who he was. Then he found a cure. You know what it was? Antidepressants.

I'm not advocating prescription solutions as the fix. We all realized that we *said* he just looked unhappy, and he *said* he felt fine, but the truth was he was acting unhappy, and his face was the obvious focal point. He wasn't ""acting out"" or acting different than we had ever known him, but that had no bearing on who he actually wanted to be, only evidenced by a guiding chemical rebalancing that changed his life forever.

He is no longer on meds, and smiles more than ever. Seriously consider investigating your underlying feelings yourself."

Carbon, water for reactions to occur in, sunlight able to reach the water without much attenuation.

Doesn't it perpetuate oppressive gender roles to be so attached to a particular one, regardless of whether or not it's your ""biological"" one?

Here in Vancouver anyway (IMHO, the most Asian place outside Asia), it sure as heck looks like the future will be a mix of Western and Asian cultures. Young Caucasians are increasingly becoming interested in aspects of Asian culture beyond anime/manga and food. Demand for Chinese-language courses is skyrocketing, and Chinese/English (and often Punjabi) signage is everywhere. Asian festivals like Chinese New Year and Diwali are widely celebrated here. Many Caucasians are cluing into the fact that there are immense opportunities linked to Asia and that Vancouver is very closely tied to them. However, they realize they're always going to be at a disadvantage if they only know English. There's also no shortage of multilingual candidates here. Embracing Asian culture is simply becoming a good bet just as embracing Western culture and English is a good bet for many Asians.

lol nah chill I aint on that tip.

The only way you can lessen that blow... which is a pretty fucking huge one lol... is if you can honestly say these were **quality** dudes you slept with, and not just random hookups with anyone. And of course if you're 100% STD free.

That is the ONLY way I can see a promiscuous past not being **THAT** much of a red flag. I would hamster ""Well shit, she only fucks the creme de la creme...""

I understand that when a legit champion beast MOTHERFUCKER of a Man is working his charm and trying to clap cheeks, it's damn near impossible for a girl's pussy to say no, since your brains goes ""durRRrrrr"" and you operate on nothing but tingles in those situations (and in almost all situations).

In a parallel example, cancer has been understood, treatable, and sometimes curable since the 20th century. We now understand some genetics of some inherited cancers.

IOIM,GirlGamers,1389992286.0,"Reminds me of that picture that went around that was like ""I don't need feminism because sexism doesn't affect me"" kind of thing.

A lot of us do experience tons of negative things just because of our sex, and that's why I came to /r/girlgamers in the first place honestly.  /r/gaming has a lot of things that aren't really personal or in any way tied with the sexism in video games, maybe you'll enjoy that more.  I enjoy it a lot, but here it's different.  It's a lot more personal, it's not so video game oriented as /r/gaming is because here is meant for females &amp; video games, not just for video games.  Like you said in your post, you want a place that has stuff all us girls can relate to -- most of us can relate to sexist experiences, but all of us can relate to sexism in games in general.  I mean that's why it's here, per the side bar ""This is a forum for discussing women in geek culture and for women to relate experiences that occur as a result of their gender.""  I don't know what you expected this sub to be, but it's not like /r/gaming, where you probably should be at right now.  How this sub is, is what it's meant to be, not some copy of /r/gaming with a ""GIRLS ONLY"" stamp on it.

&gt; Articles, rants, and comics highlighting the same old misogynistic bullshit in video games

This is really what the sub is meant for.  Not necessarily how you described it, but this sub *is* meant to inform us of the misogynistic bullshit in video games.  Honestly I don't want TV, so I had no idea of the sexist bs that microsoft and sony pulls until I came here.

&gt; There's nothing else to talk about other than being a girl, a gamer, and the disadvantages/advantages that come with being both. 

I don't know what you expect this to be, considering the sub is called GIRLGAMERS.


&gt; You'd think we could, you know, TALK ABOUT GAMES. 

We do, but if you don't want the other stuff, go to /r/gaming.

&gt; But that rarely happens without it having some kind of feminist undertone. Mixing feminism with gaming isn't a bad thing by its self, but when every single post has that same theme, it prevents the subreddit from having variety.

Again, ""This is a forum for discussing women in geek culture and for women to relate experiences that occur as a result of their gender.""

&gt; We should lean more towards the casual feel of /r/MUA or /r/TrollXChromosomes. 

No, no we should not.  I can't think of a single reason why make up and girlgamers should ever be considered on the same level.

&gt; Gaming is a hobby of ours, we don't need to be so serious, let's be honest it is just a game.

Go to /r/gaming.

&gt; I think we could adopt some of /r/Gaming's traits. 

No, no we should not.  Go to /r/gaming.  Again, this subreddit is not meant to be /r/gaming with a girlsonly stamp on it.

&gt; I don't hate the content I see there, it doesn't bore me like the majority of the content here does. Minus the sexism, I would prefer that subreddit to this one any day.

Seriously just go to /r/gaming and stay there.

What makes fujoshi SnK art worse than, say, yuri Monogatari art? I mean, I'd probably prefer the latter, due to personal preferences, but that doesn't mean that I think that Monogatari deserves to do better than SnK sales-wise."

predalienmack,scifi,1389993437.0,"I thought Pacific Rim might have been the most overrated film of the last year. I thought the visual effects were mostly boring and unimpressive, despite what must have been a difficult process to scale of monsters and robots in that amount of detail to appropriately demonstrate their daunting size on the big screen. The acting sucked, and Idris Elba was completely wasted in the film with the horrible script and character direction/development. The plot was nonsensical. The action scenes were too slow and predictable (kind of like the exact opposite of Transformers). I mean, I walked out of that film amazed that it had garnered the hype and praise that it did. With the Transformers series, at least I could understand that the epic spectacle it was going to provide every time made it bound to be an entertaining popcorn flick with some hot chicks mixed in that might make it worth seeing...Pacific Rim did not end up delivering for me on those fronts, which are the only fronts it really advertised itself to deliver on.

Edit: My original last sentence was a run on that didn't make any sense."

I don't think I am. You're using ""gender"" as a synonym for ""brain-based biological sex"", correct? 

 Some people deny any biological difference in the brain. That's why I said it contradicted the ""strong"" social construct theory.

&gt;The other example literally wants recognition as a cognitively biological man. And is not asserting a set of cultural beliefs as the true expression of ""manly"".

What? *He says exactly the same thing.* He wants to be recognized in his ""gender identity"", not just his ""brain-based biological sex"". By stating his intentions to do manly things, he's just as guilty of defining what being a man means as the cis guy. Else he would have just said ""I'm a man. That's it.""

fiveifrenzy6,GlobalOffensive,1389994021.0,"lol. That reminds me of the time Me and my friend, who have been playing video games together since our early childhood , queued on nuke and our team mates were the biggest assholes ever. Just not playing as a team and fucking everything up. They made one guy on our team drop so we vote kicked one of them, which succeeded then we kicked the other. So, it is the two of us and 3 bots on t side after it is scored 6-12. We made the bots stay in spawn and use them as extra lives for a bit. We ended up bringing it to 10-13 before the bots decide they didn't want to listen and they ended up running whereever they felt like. This helped at first because it threw them off to our original plan (they'd rotate thinking it was us) but they ended up winning anyways. If we had started like that we probably would have won against the other team but oh well. 

Just goes to show you that how you work with your team really makes a difference in winning or losing. If you have good planning and tactics you can hold your own when you are outnumbered, too. We had excellent communication and timing from playing together for so long so that really helped. The other team thought we wouldn't stand a chance.

tsaven,lostgeneration,1389994210.0,"&gt;But Philosophy is one of the most enriching degrees you can get in college.

This is absolutely true, and I never claimed it wasn't.  I claimed that it was *useless*, and from the point of view of procuring gainful employment after college, it is.  There is shockingly few/any jobs that a BA in Philosophy will get you; at minimum you need a graduate degree, and even then the very few jobs open to you are mostly in academia itself, teaching other philosophy students.

The discourse here is that people are approaching colleges as having two different functions, both of with are often mutually exclusive from each other; to give you the skills needed to be successful in the workforce, and to teach you more about subjects that you are passionate about to enrich you as a human being.  For a lucky minority, those two objectives will line up, but I'd wager that for a majority of people, they don't.  I think very few people go into Accounting, for example, because they love the subject.  They go because it's a stable job with reasonable amounts of demand and good pay, to allow them to pursue their real passions in their free time.

Going to college to study something that you are intensely fascinated and passionate about is an excellent reason to go to college, but it might not be a good reason to sink yourself $80,000k into debt at the beginning of your working life when your earning potential is the lowest it will ever be.  Especially if that massive financial investment isn't going to pay back any sort of return, and in fact could cause you immense financial pain for many many years after.  In your 40s and 50s, or when you can afford to drop that sort of money on something you're really passionate about, then it's awesome to get a degree in something you truly love.  But when you're 18 and looking at colleges, I'm of the opinion that your primary focus should be on a career and employ-ability, and for many situations college might not be part of that equation.  Of course, that's not how college is often marketed to teenagers, which I think we can agree is part of why we're in this subreddit; much of how we deal with higher education is broken.

&gt;The funny thing is most of the students in my engineering classes couldn't do actual math. They memorized formulas and shortcuts and when the professor would throw curveballs they missed those questions.

The point that I'm trying to make is that *they could completely miss those questions*.  The questions are (usually) going to be very specific on what is correct and incorrect; someone can be incorrect and that's final, there's no way they can argue their way out of it.  The liberal arts are much different in that regard; ""We're not teaching you what to think, we're teaching you how to think.""  And this is a completely valid goal, *but it's incredibly difficult to accurately evaluate success in*.  Think about the complexities of grading, say, a 101 level math exam vs an essay.  Obviously in elementary school level english someone can be specifically wrong (spelling or grammar and things like that), but college level English courses are going to be about much different things than that.

&gt;To your second point, there are far more inexplict things in Math and Physics than in Philosophy or English.

Especially once you get into seriously advanced levels of it, I'm sure there are.  However, math and physics are still at their underlying structure based on hard facts, perhaps one of the few disciplines that really are, so much so that it's almost a joke: http://xkcd.com/263/

&gt;The pretentious attitude of ""STEM"" majors has to stop. Your not any better off than anyone else, and that 60K salary isn't that much better when you consider the amount of hours you have to put in.

Don't assume I'm a STEM major.  Hell, you shouldn't even assume I ever graduated from high school."

think about it, the world has become more progressive since... The dark ages I guess.  It's going to continue to become more progressive, it's just the way of things.  I think the conservatives are actually holding that progression in check is actually holding us to a more steady and sustainable rate of progression.

whataloadofwhat,learnprogramming,1389994425.0,"&gt;In Java I can do this (assuming toString() is properly overridden):

&gt;System.out.println(new Complex(1,3).add(new Complex(2,3)));
while in C++ it's something like this (assuming &lt;&lt; blah blah):

&gt;cout &lt;&lt; (new Complex(1,3))-&gt;add(new Complex(2,3)) &lt;&lt; endl;

&gt;However, the existence of new without delete really freaks me out. Is this causing memory overflows? And, if it is, then is there simply no way to pass new objects into functions like Java's Arrays.sort(list, new Comparator(){/*omitted*/}); (not concerning anonymous class)?

&gt;Is this causing memory overflows?

It's causing a memory leak. If you run the function like that enough times you'll run out of memory.

&gt;And, if it is, then is there simply no way to pass new objects into functions

You can ~~declare them on the stack~~ *use temporary objects* rather than using new.

    std::cout &lt;&lt; Complex (1, 3).add(Complex (2, 3)) &lt;&lt; std::endl;

That doesn't make a pointer though (though afaik your original one would have just output a pointer address... not sure though). If you need a pointer in a function and want to use new(), you'll need to delete the pointer *somewhere* once it isn't being used anymore, otherwise you'll end up with a memory leak.

Might be worth considering using references (&amp;) rather than pointers (*) if you want to be able to do this though. Like:

    int function (int &amp;x) {
      x = 5;
    }

    class Complex; //defined elsewhere

    void otherFunction (Complex const &amp;c) {
      c.doThing(); //must be a const function
    }

    int main() {
      int x = 0;
      function (x);
      std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; std::endl; //prints 5
      otherFunction (Complex (1, 3));
    }

References can't be reassigned though, so they can't be nullptr. Great for passing into functions rather than a pointer. You don't need to dereference references either, just treat it like a regular variable.

&gt;Should array length always be passed to the function? Or is there a way to just add a ""sentinel value"" to the array? If yes, is it a common way? (I haven't got to those ""smarter pointers"" yet..)

C++'s standard library has a number of containers you can use rather than raw arrays. std::array and std::vector are most common I guess. They have built in size() functions.

&gt;How does the .h file know where the .cpp file is? There isn't even a (Java) Class.forName();, so how would the compiler know what to do first?

It doesn't. The .h files declare functions and variables so that other files can use them. Your .h file is just saying ""This function/class/variable exists, trust me"". When you compile a .cpp file into a .o file it stores the implementation of these functions. Then you link them all together into an executable. If you don't link the .o file, you will get a linker error because the linker can't find the implementation for a function that you have said exists. This makes it so that, assuming the header file doesn't change, the implementation can change as often as you want and you only need to recompile that single file and then relink."

Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389994509.0,"The western culture we live in (well, I live in and I assume you do too since you're asking the question) has been dominated by a primarily white, cis- and hetero-sexual male demographic for a very long time. This affects everything from pay gaps to the cost of men's vs. women's clothing to the overwhelming proportion of men in corporate and political leadership positions as opposed to other genders.

With respect to the appearance issue, it's a matter of representation. Women in the media [are underrepresented](http://www.seejane.org/research/) and almost always [heavily altered in appearance](http://gifs.gifbin.com/032012/1332267206_dove_ad_timelapse_makeup_photoshop_makeover.gif) because media executives are catering to a heterosexual male fantasy. The confluence of media and appearance modification industries (clothing, makeup, surgery, etc.) has changed the culture such that women who don't conform to the skinny-white-lady-with-flawless-skin are at a serious disadvantage in society *on top* of the whole being a woman issue. To illustrate the artificial pressure put on women to change their appearance, see [this article about shaving](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/625/who-decided-women-should-shave-their-legs-and-underarms).

There's also the social attitude that women should want to please men, that they somehow *owe* men, that they should feel honored or flattered that some guy is interested in them. The implicit message is that our own needs or desires don't matter. You get a lot of this when pushing back against harrassment, even rape. It's disgusting.

There is the flip side of this too, where the pressure to conform to the archetype of the ""manly man"" causes some males and male-identifying folks to experience stress and harrassment. For example, the use of ""gay"" as an insult, or the non-acceptance and assault of males who enjoy activities labeled as ""feminine."" But when you boil that down, it also stems from the devaluation of the femme: things that are considered feminine are bad and enjoying them makes you weak. The whole thing reeks of misogyny and men suffer for it too.

What it boils down to is that the broader culture is biased towards making women into sexual object for a specific subset men. It's started to change, but way too slowly."

I know a lot of men who have become jaded with women after having many sour experiences with them, and likewise many women who have endured the same with men.

The fact that he didn't mean to hurt you (physically or emotionally) is good, but not the only relevant thing here. It's good that he accepted it and that you guys can move on. It's absolutely possible for him never to do that kind of things again, and for you guys to get beyond this.

Keep being assertive when he tries doing things you're not comfortable with, and if he does something similar again, I would suggest you go away, because now he does know and wouldn't have that excuse anymore. But hopefully thanks to your talk this won't happen again."

So as soon as I get underneath a car and it has a shit ton of rust, it's a telltale sign that the car isn't from here and likely came from the north.

So the shops you took it to, they might not have seen a car with as much rust as your car has. For every 75 cars I work on, I probably see 1 or 2 that have a lot of rust.

There's not a special shop you need to seek out, or special procedures, but you need to be aware that if the brake lines and calipers are especially rusty you might be looking at having to outright replace them. Also the labor will likely be a little bit more since rusty parts are harder to deal with. Since we don't have snowy/salty winters here, it'll likely only be a one time replacement thing (as far as the brake lines and calipers go)

You may need other things from the underbody replaced eventually too. I can't say since I have no idea what the underside of your car looks like or how bad the rust is."

After a while we moved back to where we are both from.  6mo-1yr after that, he told me straight up that he planned to propose in the next year.  Month after month went by and no proposal.  Things quickly fell apart.  I would claim it wasn't b/c he hadn't proposed, but really it was.  I always felt that I was the one trying to move our relationship forward and he was satisfied right as we were, but ""couldn't want to marry me in the future"".  That just wasn't good enough for me.

behindtimes,truegaming,1389995472.0,"The problem with the Ultima series and 8 &amp; 9 is really an issue of having to follow up a game that many people considered the apex of video game RPGs.  It's almost impossible to ever follow up on a massive success without taking an approach of just milking a franchise.  But the Ultima series always prided itself on pushing technology forward.  That was great in the 1980s when you could still have the same gameplay pretty much, but move from 4 colors to 16 or 16 to 256, but sooner or later the gameplay had to change with this philosophy of design.  For those who don't understand what I mean, for all the clamoring Half Life 3 gets in reddit, imagine it came out but it was a f2p micro-transaction laden card trading game.

Now, as far as Ultima 9...  I tend to take the George Lucas approach when it comes to Richard Garriott.

To embrace the greed, gluttony, avarice etc, is to fully state that traditional morality is and was a construct that supported an outdated social order. Further, that the current one, which we are otherwise satiated by, conflicts with that previous morality that we would like to believe we are still the vanguard of.

What are the numbers on non-accidental deaths in Canada to non-accidental deaths in the US per capita? Because that's the statistic I'd *really* like to see.

I don't realistically think gun control will solve anything in the US. I don't think that because I think criminals will all still have guns. I think the rate of violent crimes in the US won't change. If all guns suddenly disappeared from every civilian and criminal in the US, I would expect all those gangs would just simply start stabbing the shit out of each other instead, or stabbing other people.

WormTickle,raisedbynarcissists,1389996009.0,"I have major issues with Disney and their biological essentialism. The ABC Sunday family drama Once Upon A Time has been bugging me for years with their treatment of an evil adoptive mother who is actually a pretty good mom in spite of her evil. Regina legally adopted Henry! She did not d something shady!

Mother Gothel, like you mentioned, is a kidnapper. So I can give this particular movie a pass for this flaw.

My mother adopted me when she married my dad. My issues with her don't stem from her non-biological status, it stems from her narcissistic abuse of her children.

I would hope that most adults can see it in a metaphorical sense... That king and queen didn't have to be her Real Parents (tm) to be a reassuring presence for her. In real life, I found my in-laws and other family members to give me that unconditional love, and in all honesty I'd prefer it if Rapunzel's new family were just the people she chose to be her family... The Barbarians and Flynn.

But it's a Disney fantasy, and a lot of kids fantasize about meeting their biological family and having them be perfect. I feel like it's some sad ACoN writer's wish fulfillment and way of coping. It's the ""and they lived happily ever after, the end."" Rapunzel's bio parents aren't even characters... They're silent images that Perfect Loving Parent trope can be imprinted on, and that's all they needed to be for the story, even if it is biological essentialism (apparently step parents and adopted parents are all evil, which breaks my heart. If it were only kidnappers like Gothel it wouldn't piss me off so much) and it's kind of lazy to do it."

For one, it gives the player the illusion of carving out and finding his own path through what is an entirely linear path.

It's also a fix for what could be considered a path where there shouldn't naturally be one, breaking immersion. Allowing the architecture to make sense, while still forcing the player along a path that explores the entirety of the map, without making it seem forced.

At one point he actually demonstrated how the level design makes the player survey the area, as well as stop and think about the next step (one of his better points). He easily could have applied that logic to the barriers as well.

unfickwuthable,AskReddit,1389996701.0,"yes, but usually images projected on a green screen stay static within the camera shot, unless it's inserted during post process. like when you see your weatherman standing at the green screen, if the camera pans or tilts at all, the view of the graphics will stay the same, while the anchor moves within the screen. that's why you can have 5'5"" weather girls look the same height as 6' tall anchors with their graphics.

to generate an image that isn't static inside of the shot, you must have either reference points within the shot that software can track it to (think motion capture suits, where they have the pingpong balls on joints) or use advanced math based on the cameras location, where it's looking, and it's field of view."

ciov3r,AskReddit,1389996721.0,"Also Texas.

Some of this depends on where you're at in Texas. It's a huge State, and the culture from city to city can vary drastically. In the metroplex, it's sort of a mash up. You have Fort Worth, where the stock yards are, which celebrates agriculture. I worked for the city for a while... we were allowed to dress in nice western attire (complete with hat) instead of regular business attire. Also, the animal control officers in Fort Worth literally carry lasso ropes. They will lasso feral dogs if they can't get them any other way. It's both bizarre and fascinating.

Dallas, which is right next to Fort Worth, has a big art culture and is much more ... sort of modern and artistically cultured. Not that people with cowboy hats are out of place there, but it's not dominant.

In surrounding counties, you have suburbia, agriculture towns, etc. It's not strange to see people riding horses along roadways- but it's not a main transportation, by any means. 

Coming from an agriculture family- spurs/chaps/etc is really not for work. We don't spur our horses, and chaps are hot. They're more for occasions. Like, you don't buy an expensive cowboy hat to go work cattle in. You wear it out or for an occasion.

If gender identity is a social construct, why do trans people need to dress (gender identity), and act, like their corresponding ""brain-based biological sex""?

DaddyTaco,EQNext,1389997012.0,"**Tiered Loot:** 

I think tiered loot is great. The need to replace items is important when it comes to re-playability. Having nothing to work towards makes the game boring.

**Best-In-Slot (BiS) loot elitism:** 

&gt;Make a game that revolves around players playing well because they know how to play, not because they have the best loot.

This is an excuse that unskilled players use and I'm really tired of hearing it. Skill most definitely outweighs gear. A great player with mediocre gear will almost *always* defeat an unskilled player with good gear. 

**Fast travel/flying mounts:** 

In general, convenience has become a disgusting trend in MMO's. I agree that flying mounts ruined WoW. I don't want to see them in any new MMO unless they're extremely difficult to obtain, limited and expensive to maintain.

**A two-faction system:** 

The world is a boring place without world PvP and multiple player factions. Let's be real... NPC's do NOT make the world feel alive. The constant threat of enemy players achieves this.

**End game:**

I agree 100% that GW2's end game was trash and extremely boring. There was no content. No progression. Nothing useful to work towards and overall, the end game lacked challenging content was very unrewarding. If EQ is to survive as an MMO, challenging end game content is an absolute requirement.


**General thoughts:**

* Vertical progression is extremely important in MMO's. Horizontal progression is extremely boring and unrewarding. (I'm looking at you GW2.)

* Convenience has transformed MMO's into a dull, effortless experience. Whether you're working towards transportation or gear, players should work hard for what they want. No more freebies. "

**P0011 - ""A"" Camshaft Position - Timing Over-Advanced or System Performance (Bank 1)**

&gt;**What does that mean?**

 A code P0011 refers to the VVT (variable valve timing) or VCT (variable camshaft timing) components and the car's PCM (powertrain control module, also called an ECM). That consists of a few different components but the P0011 DTC specifically refers to the camshaft (cam) timing. In this case, if the cam timing is above a set limit (over-advanced), the engine light will be illluminated and the code will be set. The ""A"" camshaft is either the intake, left, or front camshaft. 

&gt;**Potential Symptoms**-- Most likely a P0011 DTC will result in one of the following: hard starting, poor idle, and/or stalling. There are potentially other symptoms as well. Of course, when trouble codes are set, the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp, a.k.a. the check engine light) illuminates. 

&gt;**Causes** A P0011 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following: Incorrect camshaft timing Wiring problems (harness/wiring) in intake timing control valve control solenoid system Continuous oil flow to VCT piston chamber Failed timing valve control solenoid (stuck open) 

&gt;**Possible Solutions** This DTC code is a result of a mechanical fault of the VCT unit or related components, so there is no need for electrical diagnosis. Refer to vehicle specific repair manual to perform component tests for the VCT unit. Notes: Dealer techs have advanced tools and the ability to follow detailed troubleshooting steps, including the ability to test components using a scan tool.

**TL;DR** You need to take it somewhere and have it diagonosed. Often times when people have sensor codes (camshaft position sensor, O2 sensor, vehicle speed sensor, etc) it's not the sensor at all, it's something else.

Gl33m,AskReddit,1389997440.0,"&gt; Healthcare professionals serve the main purpose of keeping their patients alive

*Primum non nocere* ""First, do no harm.""

Which sounds more harmful: Letting someone say goodbye to their family, and then letting them go peacefully and pain-free, or having a person live through years of agony while their family watches their body degrade before their eyes.

Some people are fighters. They grab life with a steel grip, and won't relinquish control no matter what. They live for life, and even when their physical form gets worse, it's better for everyone when they steal every second they can.

Some people are not. Some just waste away, wishing it would just end to finish the torment.

The person dying determines how they and others experience the time they have left on earth. I believe that life is, indeed, precious. There's a story in another thread where a 17 year old girl was sent to a camp to ""pray away her gay."" A month after she returned, she committed suicide. *That* is a travesty. Suicide isn't okay as a whole. If you can really live, you should. But there's a difference between living, and simply being alive. One of the huge problems in America is that we simply do not know how to accept death. We construct bigger and bigger metaphorical medical monuments, building towards an idealistic immortality. It's given us a lot to hope for. It's done great things for millings (billions) of people. But there is a time to die. Forcing a person to stay alive beyond that point is also wrong. It *is* doing harm. And that's why I'm okay with assisted suicide. Just my two cents."

With mine, and it's slightly smaller than yours, i had my dermatologist freeze it. When that didn't work, we tried to inject it with yeast- a common treatment for warts. 

What i now know is both methods have the same mechanic. Liquid nitrogen doesn't freeze the virus to death, nor does the yeast injection somehow kill the virus. What they both do is ""trick"" your white blood cells into recognizing the wart virus by damaging the area and creating a healing response via your H-cells and T-cells (i *think*). In and of itself, our bodies are unable to recognize this virus (which, i believe is largely true of our immune system unless it's been assisted by means such as a vaccination) so you have to kick start it.

There are two other means. One is the use of [salicylic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid). It takes a long time to work, you have to be consistent about applying it and even when it burns a hole through your sole and it starts to bleed, you have to keep putting it on. You also get the joy of scraping and pulling off the dead and not so dead skin once it begins to work. Fun fun fun. 

**OR** you can just pay your dermatologist or GP to simply remove it via scalpel. In fact, if you don't bring that bastard under control, eventually you're going to have to do this anyway. 

As for me and mine, i had it burned twice with nitrogen, injected with yeast 4 times and neither worked. I am now going the salicylic acid route and even though it hurts, i have arrested its progress (4'ish mm). 

And as an aside, it's a ""[plantars wart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_wart),"" not a ""planters wart.""

Best of luck. I hope you like pain (and if what i just wrote makes you think you can avoid dealing with it, consider that the virus is damaging the nerves in the infected area. It will eventually get to the point where you feel it in EVERY step you take). "

ulvok_coven,AskHistorians,1389998032.0,"I'd make a strong division between the two cases you thought of, which might be useful to answering your question.

Marxism is pretty darned complicated. It relies on a very particular set of assumptions and is built on top of Hegelian phenomenology, frequently using Hegelian dialectic to do so. It's often boiled down to a few sentences, but in *every case* this is reductionist. Even if you just start with assumptions, the particular set of assumptions is large and original to Hegel. It's very unlikely someone before Marx thought the exact same set of ideas. Marxism is *not* its conclusion because its conclusion is trivial in most schools of political thought - no one would compete for resources in a world without scarce resources.

Rationalism effectively requires two assumptions/axioms/whatever - a definition of 'reason,' and belief in the supremacy of reason. Now, this question is hard to answer for other reasons - rationality is an old concept. You could talk about the first *modern* rationalist by identifying what the modern definition of 'reason' is. You could talk about the first rationalist ever if you have compelling evidence that there is a core definition of 'reason' which can be traced to a single individual. In that case, your argument is as accurate as your definition.

Really, most things like this boil down to how you define them and what assumptions you run under. These statements contain certain information about what writer Z thinks about X and Y, and Marxism and rationalism. You can get into some grey area - whereas Marxism is strongly defined by Marx's work, rationalism is a bit more open to interpretation, just by the word's construction in the English language.

One actual use for these statements is to denote lineages. To say ""Possessed was the first death metal band"" is to imply that, if you follow a chain of influences, you will eventually reach a band influenced by Possessed - that nobody independently generated this idea, that their use of this idea is always in reference to someone before them. In the history of philosophy, this is meaningful, because Western philosophy has always been very much in communication with itself."

Sturdybody,Seireitei,1389998392.0,"I lived in the world of the living for 50 years as a balancer, part of the Patrol Guard, fighting and defending humans and shinigami alike. You spend so much time outside seireitei? You say I should be able to identify you? Well I'll be honest, most of the shinigami I knew the names of were my fellows in Patrol Guard 3 and 5, or the captains. Are you Kiyoshi-soutaichi? Maybe Jentoru-taicho? Yukimura-taicho? Onagazame-taicho? *saying the name of his cousin was awkward, he never knew him personally just that one of his cousins was a captain* Aethos or Shin-taicho? Akimoto-taicho? Katushya-taicho? Natsuko-taicho? Haruki-taicho? Flamingo-san-taicho? Higosha-taicho? Sumiko-taicho? Hinata-san-taicho?

Oh probably not. So why should I remember the name of anyone not a captain? I know of three vice captains, actually no I don't because they're gone too. One joined a Patrol Guard at that. *Shigure was truly puzzled here, why in the world would he be expected to recognize some random shinigami he'd never spoken too.* Worse than that, if you expect me to know who you are, you should have started with a name. 

*Shigure was at his limit, there was no more reason for this conversation to continue, neither was doing well to prove their points, and obviously neither was much interested in changing their views to the others. He pulls up his hood to cover his head, still not returning his view to the shinigami in front of him, keeping his back turned.*

Whoever you are, don't tell me how to do my duty, I know that I'm scum because I left the patrol guard who did something tangible to protect those too weak to protect themselves to come here, where there is no order There are people in power, and what do they do? My own captain has spoken to me 3 times in the time I've been here. No one bellow my rank has so much as smiled in my direction.

The thing that set it off---As with a lot of fundies, I was hugely anti-gay. Then my best friend came out.

I just couldn't believe that he was sinful or anti-social or wanted to prey on children (all stuff I'd grown up being taught about gay people).

 It was really difficult to give those beliefs up, because they were attached to a whole constellation of other beliefs. But over a few years I had to re-examine my commitment to Biblical literalism and, after I admitted to myself that not everything in the Bible could be literally true, the rest fell like a set of dominos.

thunderburd,FeMRADebates,1389998400.0,"I am a former feminist, so I'll weigh in here.  When I talk to MRAs I use the terms ""kyrarchy"" or ""gender norms"".  When I talk to feminists I will sometimes use the term ""patriarchy"".  My definition for all of the above is:

""The modern system of gender roles and norms that provides unique advantages (privilege) and disadvantages to each gender.  In this system, some genders are more advantaged or disadvantaged in certain areas than others.  Sometimes these advantages or disadvantages only fall on those who enact their prescribed gender role, sometimes only on those who reject it.""

I don't believe that men have it unilaterally better than women (and I believed the same even when I was a feminist), and *I* think any definition of ""modern culture"" should reflect that (assuming you feel the same).

I know that's probably not going to end up being remotely similar to the definition you choose, but just wanted to put it here because it's the definition I used even when I *was* a feminist.  Have a great day!"

However, the current plot relevance of Ghost Banri is unacceptable to me, for all the reasons you stated. I understand that Takemiya wanted to portray Banri's struggle with this past as if it were literally a struggle between two people, but doing so has divorced his responsibility for his actions and feelings by letting all the Linda-related blame fall on Ghost Banri.

thesilvertongue,changemyview,1389998647.0,"&gt; A major part of my point is that if somebody voluntarily gets drunk, consents to drunken sex, it's not rape EVEN IF they would never have agreed to it sober. If she gives unambiguous affirmative consent while drunk, then there is no ""unclear consent"" or danger of rape, because she consented, and therefore she now bears responsibility for that choice.

The most common argument against this is that consent must be informed and therefore sober (or at least mostly sober) for it to mean anything at all. No matter how enthusiastic the participants seem, they cannot meaningfully give consent while mentally inebriated. The important question is: ***does mental inebriation by definition prevent you from giving informed consent***?


This applies wether the mental inebriation was brought on voluntarily (drinking) or involuntarily (mental illness). It only seems fair that the victim be treated the same in either case. 

Many suggest that it is wrong to drug someone (including with alcohol) in order to inebriate them to a point where they will agree with your demands (sex in this case). Using the same logic, one might argue that it is also wrong if you happen to find an inebriated person and use their weakened mental state to get them to agree to things they would refuse under normal conditions.

&gt; Now if you know this girl, and suspect she probably will regret it later, then certainly the friendly gentlemanly thing to do would be to not have sex with her, even if she clearly consents. But that doesn't mean it's wrong (at least to a threshold of illegality) to have sex with her.

The typical argument of why ought to be deemed illegal or immoral (as opposed to just ungentlemanly) is that each party has an obligation to ensure sex is healthy and consensual. In abstract moral term, you ought not to commit an action that you fear will cause undue harm to other people. In terms of sex, a participant has an obligation to ensure as best they can that their partner is sufficiently sober, mentally sound, and of appropriate age to consent to sex. 

 It follows that participants should abstain when they have reason to doubt the other person's ability to consent. Ignorance (I didn't know she was drunk, I didn't know he was only 13) don't usually hold up in court unless the actor was intentionally misled or lied to. 

&gt; If she gives unambiguous affirmative consent drunk, and you suspect she will regret it later so you don't have sex with her, you didn't save her from YOU, you saved her from HERSELF. 

This embodies the second important question in this debate: ***Do you have an obligation to refrain from hurting another person even if they agree to it?*** and ***Does this answer change if the participant only  agrees willing while mentally inebriated?***

One answer, is yes, you always have an obligation to refrain from committing actions that might harm other people even if they are enthusiastic. If a friend asked you to push him in the face, you ought to refuse. If someone asks you to have sex and you suspect they will regret it or feel violated, you should refuse. Don't do anything that might seriously harm someone even if they think it will be a good idea. 

This is especially important when someone is severely intoxicated and incapable of rational thought, they are more likely to agree to things they wouldn't have sober. "

Gl33m,AskReddit,1389998931.0,"&gt; but it all comes down to when life really begins.

*but just because you believe that doesn't mean you should infringe on other people's rights.*

&gt;I have to question why the view isn't valid as well for the fetus?

To me, it doesn't come down to when life begins. A baby doesn't depend on *the* mother. It depends on a caregiver. It can't fend for itself, but anyone with basic know-how can keep it alive. A fetus depends on *the* mother. It *must* live inside her body. There are some extremely rare cases of premature births as early as 20 weeks (though even if the infant survives, the likelihood of any number of health problems goes up astronomically.) I'm not entirely sure how feasible it would be to create an artificial womb. I'm sure there are experiments, but it can't be all that successful if we don't have a lot of people talking about it. (A faulty assumption I know.) So, for the sake of this argument, let's assume a fetus must be inside the woman for at least 30 weeks (and preferably 37). For the sake of this argument, we will consider any group of cells that could even *potentially* develop into a human child as a full human with full rights.

I do not believe that any human being as any kind of inherent duty to provide their body to another human being even if that other human being literally can not survive without it. 

So instead of a fetus, let's say there's a cute little 6 year old girl. She has some kind of extremely rare health condition. The way the condition works is she will die if the condition isn't removed. The only known way to remove the condition is to connect the child to another human being, and only one particular human being that is a perfect match will do. That perfect match is found. What must happen to remove the condition from the little girl is a tube will be attached between the girl and this on in 7 billion human, and it will remain there for 9 months. The tube must be short, so the little girl must always be with this human. Care must be taken that nothing happens to the tube. If the tube is removed before the 9 months are up, the little girl dies. I believe that no one on earth has the right to tell this special human that they *must* go through with the procedure to fix the little girl's condition. Similarly, I believe that it is completely within that human's rights to decline having the procedure done, or to at any point in time during the procedure remove the tube and walk away. Yes, this means the little girl will die. That's terrible, and I would hope that the human she's matched with agrees to the procedure, and doesn't remove the tube. But it's the human's decision, and *only* the human's decision to do so."

No it doesn't! Geopolitical focus has never been about acquiring supply, if it was then you'd be correct because domestic supply is rising. But domestic supply is still sold to the highest bidder internally or externally.

The 'wars for oil' isn't about supply, it's about punishing countries that have bucked the opec deal of pegging oil sales to the US dollar. To buy oil from an opec nation, you _must_ purchase it in us dollars. This creates and artificial demand for the currency which conflates the purchasing power of those who control the US dollar.

Saddam and Iraq decided to accept payment in currencies other than the US dollar and we invaded them within the year because ""9/11"" and ""weapons of mass destruction.

belril,Journalism,1389999950.0,"As an English major now working as a journalist, here are my thoughts:

1. It depends entirely on where you go to school. I'm familiar with my experience (small, liberal arts institution focused on preparing people for grad school), and not a whole lot of other places. 
2. An English degree will serve you well when it comes to thinking critically about the act of reading and the act of writing. It will help your writing skills, for sure, but those skills will be focused towards literary analysis, and possibly the craft of creative writing if you choose to go that way. Now, writing is writing is writing, and learning how to write will help you in a bunch of other endeavors, but you're not going to be learning how to write technical documentation, or business plans, you'll be learning how to write literary criticism (and possibly some more creative stuff as well, depending on the department, and your university). 
3. Journalists don't write like English majors. An English essay calls for you to talk with authority about complicated literary concepts (with matching complciated jargon) while an article requires you to reach a broad audience. The more journalistic writing I did, the more my academic writing suffered, actually.
4. I think it's perfectly possible to get a good training in journalism, without a degree. I worked at my school newspaper for my entire undergrad career, and spent my summers working internships in the field. While I don't have the formal training of some of my peers, I can still write with the best of 'em. 
5. The economics of both degrees are pretty hard. As you'd probably expect, getting a job with an English degree isn't the easiest thing in the world, and the same goes for Journalism. The fact of the matter is that there aren't a whole lot of jobs available, and you're not sparing yourself all that much grief by picking one over the other, since there's frequently a lot of overlap in what employers are looking for. 

So here's the bottom line: you want to do as well as you can in school. If writing papers (upon papers, upon papers) about books seems like fun to you, go English. If you'd rather spend time learning about Journalism, that's your path, IMO. 

Good luck."

Lluxx,changemyview,1390000020.0,"I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but my claim was only ever that transitioning cures gender dysphoria. The question which you replied to with that link as evidence was:

&gt; Could you provide sources of trans people who transition and then feel they are still not masculine or feminine enough and continue to suffer from dysphoria?

Note that I never claimed transgender individuals would cease to suffer from social ostracisation after transitioning - or before it. 

I would have assumed that it was obvious that transgender individuals suffer from discrimmination just because of their status as trans, so I assumed it was likewise obvious that although transitioning cures their dysphoria (which I will clarify refers to the depression, shame, stress and disgust towards their genitals as well as feeling that their body is not correct), as transgender individuals still suffer from harrassment due to their status like being fired, kicked out of their homes (for the youth), attacked on the street, harrassed or even straight up murderered, then transitioning cannot cure that because if anybody finds out of their status as trans, they are at risk. 

This is why I am shifting the burden of proof onto you. My meaning was ""Transitioning cures gender dysphoria.""

You retorted with, ""No, because of high transgender suicide rates.""

My response is, ""Studies with actual data and not pure conjecture show that it is discrimmination, not dysphoria, which cause higher suicide rates among the trans population.""

So now the burden of proof is on you to provide better evidence - personally, I would recommend some kind of testimony from a good portion of trans individuals who claim that they have only felt worse since their transitioning, but really whatever works for you as long as it uses actual data - that it is not discrimmination and social reasons which are the cause of these suicide rates, but actually continuing gender dysphoria. 

If you cannot prove this, I do not see how you can argue that transitioning does not cure gender dysphoria when testimony from people who actually have the condition and professionals who have studied the condition goes against you. 

&gt; And it may be that the reasons for not having such surgery are more easily seen by someone who is a Christian due to their spiritual orientation that someone who is a psychologist, due to a lack of the aforementioned spirituality in the field. (at least at this point)

That is altogether an illogical point. You cannot argue that professionals are not the best to work in their own field when you have been asking me a great many technical questions about GID as a mental condition. If you really believed that, you would have simply said in the first place that trans individuals are confused spiritually and need spiritual guidance, not psychology, rather than asking about brain problems. 

&gt; But isn't that the whole point of the surgery? To get the person to feel like and look like the gender they are comfortable with so that they fit into society?

Yes, it is. And let's not assume that trans people live under a rock and don't realise the dificulties that being trans will mean for them. They know about the suicide rates, the likelihood of people they know despising them, the likelihood of being a victim of a hate crime. The therapists they are required to discuss their GID with know this. 

With that in mind, if it was 'merely a hack', why would they do it? Why put yourself in danger for something that won't heal them. Read the answers from trangender individuals on this very thread; they knew all these dangers, but they went ahead and did it anyway and now they're happier for it. They don't consider their bodies unhealthy; they feel better without the dysphoria even knowing that the price for not ""passing"" now is huge. You would deny them that happiness and tell them an unprofessional anti-transgender Christian knows their own mind better than themselves. 

&gt; To get the person to feel like and look like the gender they are comfortable with so that they fit into society?

No, it's so they feel comfortable within themselves. Again, they risk very real consequences from society for doing this, but gender dysphoria is so horrible to experience that they are willing to do it anyway, because it is proven to relieve that dysphoria.

So what do we have here? We have a group of people with GID. The worst symptom of GID is gender dysphoria. There is only one thing which has an overwhelmingly high success rate for relieving gender dysphoria and that is transitioning. This group of people are aware that they may suffer societal consequences for not fitting into the norm. They go through a very, very long process of evaluation before they are allowed to alter their body in any way. Some choose to live as their preferred gender, but not have surgery. Others choose to have surgery. Some take a third option. 

How are their bodies not healthy? They are altered, yes, but they can still work and do anything anyone else can. Their intelligence and physical ability are not impaired. They are still capable of being fully normal and productive members of society. 

If I have chronic tonsillitis and it's causing me great pain, would you tell me that I shouldn't have the surgery to remove them and should instead meditate on the pain until I reach inner understanding? Would you tell me it's a hack to alter my body? Would you tell me that the role of the tonsils is not clearly understood, so I should put up with my suffering multiple times a year? After I'm completely healed and back to normal after my surgery, would you then go on to tell me that I'm not healthy and have mutilated my body?

Of course, there are no societal consequences for having a tonsillectomy. People will not attack me for having them removed. But why should people outside the norm be forced to live with inner unhappiness (which, I remind you, must be incredibly powerful for them to seek to change it knowing how society may react to them) just because the general public doesn't like it? Trans individuals are not hurting anyone and - as I have pointed out time and time again - are happier with being relieved of their dysphoria. It is not up to you or I, who are fortunate enough to not have GID and not have to make this choice, to tell them that they are wrong and have mutilated themselves when they are happier and a danger to no one. If society changes, the negative effects of GID will be greatly changed - the dysphoria will remain, but at the very least they will not have to fear so much anymore. 

The burden of change isn't on the minority who are not harming you and are making the choices which science tells them work. It is on society as a whole to accept that it is none of their business what someone does with their own genitals to alleviate their own suffering.

In contrast, if a woman decides that she wants to attack me, she's not going to do much more than superficial damage. And that's if I let her. I have a lot more options, the easiest of which is to run away. Other options, in escalating order, are to grab her arms, shove her away, punch her, or lift her up and break her back over my knee while yelling ""FATALITY.""

Testosterone is a hell of a drug. In a fight between a 150-pound man and a 170-pound woman, I'm putting my money on the man every single time. So unless the woman is a cock-diesel motherfucker who is headlocking a dude and punching him in the face, I'm not going to care.

xakh,nostalgia,1390000719.0,"Alright. I'm going to respond without the traditional vitriol.

We both have valid points. If you want to buy an Alienware as a status symbol, similar to a BMW, realize that you are going to get flak for it. If you want the aesthetic of a gaming laptop, they make a good one. However, realize that as a use case, yours and mine are worlds apart.

ChromeOS, Android, Amazon ECS, the Ubuntu cloud service, most large scale animation studios (which use MAYA), architecture firms, most small scale server systems, and Google's search system all run on Linux. in an enterprise environment, specifically of tech support, high end design work, and security consultation, Linux is effectively *required.* Lenovo's Think series are all on a list of fully approved Linux ready hardware. The W530 is the *only* one with a dedicated GPU. The scientific aspect of it, which does indeed boost OpenGL performance (double sided faces, dedicated rendering, GPU computing, among other CAD, 3D modeling, graphing and image manipulation tweaks and boosts), are a very different concern than using DirectX/3D, which are almost 100% game centric, and thus the GTX cards outperform my K2000M in every way in those aspects. However since I do not want to use those capabilities, I chose a system focused on different priorities. The fact that I can play games on it is nice, but it would not be a deal breaker if its game performance was piss poor for me. I've compared CAD benchmarks, rendering benchmarks, and other business performance systems, which all point to the K cards being a lot more useful in my department. However, in the industry of tech professionals, due to the way we have to defend budget expenditures, upgrades and other systems, we both entrench ourselves deeply into one side or another, and we have a lot of difficulty discerning the validity of other points of view. This argument definitely proves that, where a minor difference in hardware preference devolved rather quickly into a /b/-esque slugfest that made us look much more like 7th graders arguing over superheroes than anything else. I had this thought last night as I was headed to bed, after I'd been a bit removed from this argument, and I realized this is rather pointless. I'm sorry for taking this dispute to such a childish level, and I'm sure you'd agree that this does not represent who we are, or what we represent."

Teslatyr,AskReddit,1390000739.0,"I feel you on the societal problems even if I don't fully agree with your position.

The only thing that tended to be common across all perpetrators was that they didn't suddenly ""snap"", but thought out and planned the shootings well before they happened. We have to think that as a society there should be signs that something terrible is being planned, and in some cases, the school shooters even come outright and say what they want to do, well before they commit the atrocity. The problem is that a lot of this stuff gets brushed off and not taken seriously. We wouldn't even need a police state/minority report situation to stop these criminals before they become criminals. Instead just people looking out for other people. Don't send the police right away, send a friend or family member to check in and see if there's major social issues brewing. 

While I agree that there is a lot of debate surrounding what exactly to do with guns I believe the real problem lies not with the catalyst of the criminal's destruction (i.e. guns) but with the person themselves, a human being. We all kind of mention mental health in passing when we talk about gun control laws, but it never gets enough attention. Consider the [Piers Morgan-Alex Jones debate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZvMwcluEg) that gained so much popularity online. Piers mentions mental health help at the beginning but it gets no attention after that point. It's just arguing about crime statistics and gun laws. We need to seriously start investing more into helping the people who need it the most, the would-be criminals. I don't know the best way to do that but I know that mental health efforts of any kind would be a good start."

In a world where vaccinations work with 100% certainty and everybody around an unvaccinated person either *want* to be unvaccinated or *are* vaccinated you would be correct.

However, that is not the case.

&gt;It is unethical to force a medical procedure onto person A to benefit person B without knowledgable consent.

By that logic, it is unethical to teach a person English instead of French or vice versa unless the person can already somehow communicate which language they wish to learn.

When people are children and do not asses pros and cons well we make decisions we deem fit for them. Vaccinations have shown to be very beneficial while only rarely harming the person, therefore this is one of the cases that it is not of large concern that they cannot give knowledgeable consent."

What do you do? John is being a total jerk and you would really like to punch him. On the other hand, he has never asked you to punch him before, so it's probably just the alcohol talking. You suspect that if you do punch him, John will wake up the next day feeling hurt and violated. It's likely he'll regret asking you and even resent you for it afterwards. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe he just likes showing off his toughness and ability to doge punches. Perhaps he would ask you the same question in a sober state. 

Still, John asked *you*. He's literally begging for it. Is it really your fault if he realizes it's a bad idea when he sobers up after the fact?

aidrocsid,rpg_gamers,1390001806.0,"This. These games are meant to reflect D&amp;D, meaning the decisions each character makes every few seconds are vital. It helps to think of cast-times as rounds. Also, while it's a little different in D&amp;D than in other games, don't forget about the holy trinity, tank/healer/dps. Physically weaker characters should run away if they're under attack, while stronger characters should peel for those in danger of dying. Formation is key, don't let your casters get flanked. Line of sight can be very useful too, as well as narrow doorways and passages that can limit the number of enemies that funnel through at once. Save often and in multiple files, because you never know when a slight change to your approach will make all the difference in an upcoming fight. 

Make sure to at least get a cleric and memorize as many healing spells as possible. D&amp;D is stingy about heals compared to other games, but that's all the more reason to make sure you get the most out of them. It's not a bad idea to have a second set of heals either. Healing potions are pretty vital too, though it's a good idea to try to stretch them out. "

* Baby-daddy Drama

* I Am Not Your Babies Father

I disagree with this. The word rape might make some think of a masked figure violently attacking a helpless woman on the street. But rape doesn't have to be that overt or obvious. Many simpler less melodramatic offenses have been classified as rape. It's not at all unreasonable that sex with a drunk would fall into the same category."

The 737 NG since its introduction has been operated by a huge spread of very different airlines, some with questionable safety practices (or at least, safety practices not up to the same standards as the top 30). When the A320 was introduced, it was not the favored airframe of smaller airlines; the 737 was. It still is to a degree, but the polarity is not what it was when the A320 first entered service.

By a ridiculous margin, the #1 cause of aviation accidents is human error. Whichever aircraft is being operated by more small airlines with fewer resources and thereby greater susceptibility to hiring poor pilots will have a higher accident rate. The 737 is an intrinsically safe aircraft, with robustly redundant *mechanical* systems, which is something the A320 lacks in some areas, such as control surfaces. The 737 can suffer full electrical, hydraulic, and engine failure and still fly. I'm not saying that the A320 isn't safe, I ardently believe that they are equally safe in the right hands.

vehementvelociraptor,AskReddit,1390004632.0,"I think we agree on a lot of points, and let me assure you I'm not trying to blindly spew rhetoric of the pro-gun camp, I'm legitimately giving a lot of thought to your point.  As such:

I think your main argument here is dependent on some flawed assumptions.  I'll try to address them:

&gt; The lower level criminals who might not have the contacts or balls to get their hands on guns are going to find it a lot easier if they are legal to have.

I think you misunderstand how very little effort it currently takes to get an unlicensed firearm in the States.  I'm (at least I think) a pretty upstanding guy in the middle class who has had no problem with the law or any involvement in criminal activity.   And I know that it would take less effort from me to go to the wrong side of town, drop some cash, and walk away with a firearm with no serial number, rather than going to a gun store and legitimately and lawfully buying one.  (background check, waiting, etc.).  It doesn't even take balls to do something like that, just a punkass pussy kid who's too stupid for his own good.

&gt; and they're also going to find it easier if the person in the next street has some in their house.

This is 100% accurate and you are right.  Actually, you even made me think about my guns at home.  All but one of them is locked up, and any burglar worth his salt would be able to grab it.  I'm going to make an effort to routinely lock it up when I'm not home anymore.   Convenience be dammed.  Now, there is one really good way to prevent this: correct storage and security of your firearms.

A correctly installed safe (even one of the lower-middle end ones) is nearly impossible to break into with conventional means.  I mean, it's entirely possible with the right tools, but I doubt someone is going to go to the effort to get hydraulic cutters and or a plasma torch to get into it.

""But not everyone is going to lock their guns up like that""

Unfortunately this is currently the case.  I think that a few policies could be enacted to combat this.  Firearm sales only to people who show the capability to safely secure their weapons.  It wouldn't be that difficult.  Proof of a safe or gun lock would be more than sufficient.  This would be infinitely easier to implement than sweeping firearm control legislation.

To your last point about the kidnapping, my point about the ease of access even to illegal firearms makes your point tenuous at best.  Anyone who has the presence of mind and balls to kidnap someone would find getting an illegal firearm seem like a cakewalk.

But, you do have a fair point about how they could just as easily get a legal firearm in my ideal universe.  There's really no good answer.  And really, there's no one good solution that's going to effectively get rid of the problem.  I think it's going to take a lot of smaller measures done *correctly* to actually have a legitimate chance at reducing gun violence:

- Better mental healthcare and screening (Might prevent your kidnapper scenario)

- Better background checks and limitations on who can buy firearms (such as universal background checks for the mentally unstable, proof of being able to secure their weapons, and general firearm education.

There are a lot more, but I don't think that stricter gun control will noticeably have an effect on gun violence.  I wish it would, I would support it, but it just seems completely unlikely.

Not trying to convert you to pro gun, I just hope you can see that the solution to this problem is going to lie somewhere in the middle of our two mindsets.  We're never going to be completely rid of firearms or people who would do harm with them, but through some thoughtful measures I believe we can significantly reduce gun violence."

If you haven't already given back her things, put them in a box (or few), seal them and leave them at her father's house. Don't check her facebook, twitter, tumblr, whatever, no matter how bad your curiosity begs you to from now on. Maybe in five or ten years you can have a friendship and reminisce about the not-so-good old days, but anytime in the near future would be a very bad idea, considering how easily it seems you've allowed yourself to get sucked back in before. If she comes crying back to you for any reason, don't answer her calls. Ignore her texts. Block her messages if need be. Distract yourself by doing positive things when it gets rough. Take up a hobby or few, go out and meet new people, hang out with friends that won't bring up memories of the two of you together, hit the gym, go for a run - whatever positive changes you can make that involve her or memories of her in zero ways. Five years of young love can be an incredibly tough thing to entirely abandon, but if you get desperate and feel yourself starting to cave, make a list of the ways she screwed you over or things you didn't like about her and reference it when your good-times nostalgia starts to itch. In time, you won't need the list, you'll just have the great new life you've built. 

Embrace being single and all the glory that comes with it as best as you can, and remember it won't be that way forever. When you feel ready, start looking for a better partner, one who won't cheat on you or send you spiraling downwards by means of confusing behavior. A little bit, I hate to admit it, but getting out there and dating others, even just practice dates, can be a great way to start picturing yourself happy with others and fulfilled sans your long-term ex.

Since your résumé should be tailored for each job you apply for, consider using a [Networking Biography](http://theakelley.com/a-networking-bio-why-use-one/) as a more effective tool. 

Third, make yourself easy to find by ensuring your LinkedIn profile is up to date as well as ensuring your most current résumé is posted on some job boards that are a fit for you.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390006221.0,"&gt;hey have to be transferred somewhere, and there is Congressional resistance to this.

And countries who don't want them, or who the US can't transfer them to, notably Yemen.  There are, last I heard about 55 yemeni's at Guantanamo who are cleared for release but the US cannot send them to Yemen where they would be tortured, it can't send them to the US mainland as that would be detaining them illegally under US law, and no 3rd party country wants them.  So.... they remain trapped in limbo. 

You have to be very careful sending them to any country that holds US assets (beyond diplomatic assets like embassies), because almost certainly many of these people were illegally detained and tortured.  So they could bring a civil suit in whatever country the end up in.  The US could (probably rightly) claim whatever immunity it wants, if that country seizes a couple of hundred million dollars in US assets and pays it to former 'suspected terrorists' it's going to look really really really bad.  Really bad. 

Even Omar Khadr, who is a Canadian child soldier the US illegally detained is slowly winding his way through the canadian legal system to go after our own government for not doing its duty to try and get him returned, and then for making an unlawful agreement with the US transferring him to custody in Canada, and his ongoing unlawful detention as being a child soldier detained as an adult.  He'll probably be an old man by the time all this gets sorted out, and quite possibly very rich.  Whether that will come out of Canadian or US government pockets remains to be seen, but there are a whole lot of ways sending detainees away can go as badly as keeping them quietly away from civilization at Gitmo.

But yeah, being trained in theatrical makeup makes every day pretty rough. I'm used to makeup for the camera, makeup for stage and film. Which is 'lighting proof'. I CAN do light makeup, I do it on my friends all the time, but when I do it on myself I never feel like I look....finished I guess? Its bizarre, lol. It spiraled out of control pretty quick. One day you just go out wearing stage lipstick, then the next maybe you leave your lashes on. Then before you know it you're leaving the house looking like RuPaul lmao"

To answer your second question (should AD server continue working fine), the answer is yes, it should, with caveats.  FSMO roles need to be separated, so it's possible for some things to not work after awhile if one of the FSMO roles is inaccessible for a length of time.  However, the ""visible"" side of AD (user/device authentication) should indeed continue properly if DNS is configured properly *everywhere*, and your remaining DNS server was accessible and had consistent data about domain resources.  Assuming all hosts have either DNS1 or DNS2 as their primary DNS servers (and the other as alternate), with no other DNS servers configured, this outage should not have caused downtime assuming dcdiag says everything else is working properly.

[o_O](http://imgur.com/8spLush) 

Why are you hanging out with a guy you describe like that? 

Aside from that wtf moment, rehearsing conversations when you're alone is often a good idea in these situations. Write out what you want to say to him, like how important honesty is to your relationship, and that you've heard he's in another relationship with a different woman and you'd like to hear his perspective on what's been going on. When practicing the conversation, imagine the things he might say to you, good and bad, and rehearse responding to him. If you need to vent angrily, it's better to do it before you have the conversation than during the real one. Get it off your chest and start practicing responses to even the worst circumstances with calmly controlled things you can say. Prepare for the fact that he may very well be in another relationship and it might be coming to an end, but also keep in mind this guy whose intentions clearly aren't good may be full of shit and trying to cause drama where there isn't any. After asking your boyfriend to please explain what's been going on, bite your tongue and listen to him talk. Don't cut him off, don't jump in, make a mental list of questions to ask when he's done if you feel them arise while he's talking, but let him say what he needs to say before asking questions. If you start to feel yourself getting defensive or emotional, just take a breather, maybe tell him you need to use the restroom or something, and take ten long, deep breaths (more if you need them) until you feel you're fully in control of your emotions again. If you feel like it's an oncoming storm, tell him you thought you were ready for this conversation but perhaps it's a better idea to have it later when you're less likely to get upset. 

If you feel like he's lying to you, don't go snooping or start calling him a liar - emotional states aren't the best judges of truth and can often be misleading. If you *know* he's lying to you because he says things totally rational you would 100% know contradict facts, break it off and start the search for a non-cheater. 

I have no idea if you've been with this guy for weeks, months, or years, or if you have any reason other than some rumours that he might be cheating on you, but I hope you can stay calm and get to the bottom of things without losing your cool, find healing if he has indeed been cheating, and find comfort if it's just all a big misunderstanding. Keep in mind going in he's currently your partner, and try to give him as much benefit of the doubt as you would want if the situation were reversed. If it's a genuinely good thing and he's a decent person, he'll understand your need to address these rumours you've heard and he'll want to set the record straight. The longer you go without addressing it, the more things will eat at you, so I'd encourage you to do it as soon as you possibly can. "

Secret_Wizard,wow,1390007434.0,"I remember my first day playing very clearly. It was mid-vanilla, shortly before Ahn'Qiraj released. I chose Dwarf because they had the most balanced starting stats and rolled Priest because I thought I could be paid for my healing services for dungeons. About half way through the starting zone, I was getting pretty bored of spamming Smite over and over again, so I figured that if I was just going to be casting one spell repeatedly, it might as well be stronger ones. I rerolled a Gnome Mage, and continued playing as that.

Some time later, I was around level 8-10. I was exploring up north near the frozen lake south of Gnomeregon... And somehow I ended up falling into that tiny-ass puddle of water in the center of the lake. I hadn't the slightest clue how to swim, so I ended up flailing uselessly under the water while I slowly drowned. I was terrified by the incredibly ominous ""Release Spirit"" button, and only clicked it 'cause there was a timer counting down to automatic release anyway. The ""spirit world"" with the giant angel, spirally sky, and haunting music scared the shit out of me, so I immediately logged out and made a Night Elf Hunter.

I fell off Teldrassil. Then I made a Forsaken Warlock, and never looked back to the Alliance once. I was still a Priest at heart, and when I ended up making another later, I fell in love."

predalienmack,scifi,1390007654.0,"In response to your part b (and technically, Walker's original point above), I honestly don't think this film was intended to be bad like it was. With the way it was advertised, I got the feeling that it was set up to be the series that would knock out Transformers as the yearly summer-blockbuster-action movie with robots and that it would possibly bring some well developed sci-fi back into the mainstream movie scene. That's the only reason I can think of for using a well renowned director like Del Torro and a well respected and underrated actor like Elba in a movie like this: to potentially have people take a movie with a premise like this more seriously, not less. 

I did not hop onto any sort of hype train over the film until I saw many reviewers whom I found reliable and who articulate their opinions well rave about how awesome the movie was, which threw me for a loop when I saw it and wasn't even entertained by the action, let alone how put off I was about the terrible writing. The problem with this movie is that there were scenes of truly awful character development where I was utterly unsure if those who wrote it wanted me (as part of the audience) to actually be connecting with the characters or just cringing at how generically they were written, which is a testament to how juvenile the writing was in the film. 

It throws me off because I can't tell if they were going for that Neon Genesis Evangelion-feel that you mentioned and just epically failed at it or if they were going for the Piranha 3D-spoof-awesome ""guy movie""-just be as ridiculously and humorously bad as possible and roll with it-feel and really, really screwed that up, as well. Either way, the movie was a complete failure in my eyes and in no way deserved any sort of award nomination and it's easily one of the worst movies I've seen in theaters in the past decade."

*However*, the benefits of XFS really only show themselves if you're writing stuff a lot. If you're not writing much, mostly just treating the filesystem as an archive (i.e., almost exclusively reading), it doesn't matter quite so much.

I use ZFS to serve up movies (using FreeBSD instead of Linux). ZFS has a lot of fantastic features to it, none of them really specific to high performance to large files.

SC2 is an Esport. The Esport aspect of SC2 is going through a transition period right now, with many people retiring, teams folding, and sponsors leaving. The scene and subreddit get excited when they see things like this because it shows that the company in question recognizes that SC2 is a big enough deal that it warrants throwing money at the scene.

So when people circlejerk how awesome Red Bull is for doing this, and they're going to go buy some Red Bull ASAP, they're trying to show Red Bull that their support is appreciated, and worth while. Companies won't support the scene if they don't get anything out of it. Without Corporate support, the scene will crumble and die.

Red Bull is a really large company (compared to most other Esports sponsors) and they seem to be fervent supporters of Starcraft. That's why this is a big deal and that's why everyone is talking about how great Red Bull is. Because it is, and they are.

I see your point, but I would contest that the People would definitely win, Firstly good luck getting a majority of civilians on side and organised, with all media proclaiming any protestors as terrorists and with the internet shut down and all communications tapped by the NSA.
Secondly, no matter how much small arms you obtain, its not going to do shit against an Abrams or a predator drone so no army vs army situation would be successful.  But guerilla warfare is surprisingly effective and it wouldnt be clear cut for either side, probably a long bloody drawn out skirmish, causing as much economic ruin as infrastructure damage.

So i suppose its a kind of mutually assured destruction either way it goes, so i guess your point still stands.

But aside from that end of the debate. it seems incredibly weird to me (English BTW) that you would even need a backup plan like this, sure the government can be non-effective and fuelled by greed, but flat out evil to the point where no force for change exists except armed guerrilla warfare is the only response left seems like an impossibility.

Are we talking about the original claim of 97% of a survey of 12,000 scientists that turned out to be 75 of 77 of those 12,000 responding to 2 biased survey questions, or the more advanced version a few years along where they are dependent on agreeing with global warming in order to get research grants?  Doesn't really matter, since the climate isn't cooperating.

&gt; I also lol at the thought of renewable power ruining the economy. 

Tell it to the coal companies the EPA is trying to put out of business, on which much of the economy of 16 states depends...

...or to the offshore oil producers trying to get permits that have been almost impossible to get for years... 

...or the oil producers who had permits (since revoked) to drill on Federal land... 

...or the people trying to get the Keystone Pipeline built (which we are on the verge of losing entirely, as Canada looks to ship its oil elsehwhere)...

...or the scores of coal-fired and gas fired power plants the EPA is forcing to shut down when we were already below required minimum reserve generation capacity.

If it weren't for fracking technology coming out of left field to rescue US oil and gas production, we'd likely be paying twice what we are now for gasoline, and electricity - which would also affect the economy.

solo_sysygy,MilitaryPorn,1390009259.0,"Whoa, slow down with the straw man arguments. At no point did I make any statement regarding American culture or the overall quality of the US Army officer corps. I merely observed that a guy with 90-days of training is not really ready to be an officer in combat, a reality that I think applies regardless of your cultural background. I'm not even saying that those hastily-commissioned officers were *bad* officers, just that they were almost certainly not sufficiently prepared for the enormously taxing demands of combat leadership.  Some of them learned on the job, overcame huge obstacles, and did great things.  Others were killed in their first engagement. 

Believe me, I fully recognize the quality of the US Army officer corps, both through study of history and through considerable personal experience in both peace and war.  While there is an interesting discussion to be had on that topic, that wasn't remotely what I was attempting to address.  I was merely saying that 90 days of training is not adequate prepare someone to be an officer in combat.  It wasn't true then, and it's even less true now.  But the reality is that every military learns how to function with constrained resources, the most important of which is time. A 90-day commissioning program is a terrible compromise that came at an awful cost: unprepared leaders.  What's worse is that it was a self-perpetuating problem--the faster you commission leaders, the more frequently they get killed, necessitating that you quickly run their replacements through hasty training, which makes them more likely to get killed . . .

PlushieChomby,relationships,1390009268.0,"That's a really tough situation, and I wish there was an answer that was easy to execute. 

My mom has had type 2 diabetes for over two decades and refuses to seek treatment or even believe it's detrimental to her health, regardless of how visible it is to the rest of us. In junior high I even resorted to hiding her pills (obtained from our family doctor by dad) in her food like I did for our dog's meds in the hopes of helping her get healthier. These days I can't imagine how hard it is for dad to cope with her refusal to seek treatment or even eat more cautiously, but somehow they're still happily in love. 

**""No physician can give health and happiness to the man who enjoys his affliction. For such a man, health and happiness are always contradictory."" ~Calvin Miller** 

Sit her down and tell her in no uncertain terms how her refusal to take care of herself has affected your life. Tell her how you love her and how you're terrified that if she doesn't get help, her diabetes is going to kill her. Offer to go to the doctor with her, to change diets together, to find support groups, to walk this path to better health with her in whatever way you can, in whatever way she needs as long as it's progressing toward health. 

Then listen when she speaks and ask yourself if you can deal with her answers for the long haul. Some people just won't get help. You can't force them, you can't hospitalize them, you can't change them, you can only encourage them and accept the reality they've chosen for themselves. You can lead a horse to water, by various means of torture and/or manipulation you can force the horse to drink, but you can't change the horse's point of view. My dad has devoted half of their marriage to encouraging my mom to change where he can and mostly accepting that she won't but loving her anyway. That is a *hard* road to take, even just witnessing it from the outside that's obvious. 

If you can't imagine yourself making that kind of decision to stick it out, which I honestly wouldn't wish on anyone, it would be totally understandable to tell her that if things don't change, your relationship will. It might very well be the catalyst she needs to realize the depth of both your concern and her problem, and she may be willing to budge and seek help if it's that or losing you. She may also decide to continue living in denial, and you'll have to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to live with. If you do, consider taking up cooking and start making her diabetic friendly meals without her realizing that's what they are, or finding ways to cope with the horrible emotional position it puts you in. 

Whatever happens, you're both still young and you have plenty of time left in this world to find someone who values their health as much as you value yours. I wish you all the best either way, and if you ever need to talk, please feel free to drop me a line and I'll help where I can or listen if you just need to vent. &lt;3 "

Secret_Wizard,gaming,1390009593.0,"Above all, Dark Souls is unforgiving and very punishing of your mistakes. It's difficult, yes, but not nearly as extreme as reddit likes to say it is. You simply can not rush into the fray, mash buttons, and expect to win (at least, until you have intricate knowledge of enemy locations and movesets). The key to victory is to proceed slowly, scan the environment for traps and ambushes, lure enemies one at a time, play it safe and defensive, and strike only when they are open. Naturally, there are a lot of moments where Dark Souls does not allow you to take it slow, and these are the most difficult areas. [To put it visually...](http://imgur.com/Sx00osn)

Dark Souls shares a lot of design philosophy with the original Castlevania on NES. Both games often give you the tools to the next ""puzzle"" before it shows up. Castlevania gives you a throwing axe before a room with swooping bats. Dark Souls gives you a shield that is immune to poison before a poison swamp area.

Souls are the one-in-all currency of the game. Used to level up, purchase items and spells, upgrade equipment... When you die, all your souls are deposited at a bloodstain near your death location and you respawn at the last visited Bonfire. You can retrieve it, sure, but nearly everything you've killed on the way has respawned. Die again, and a new bloodstain is created and the old one is lost forever.

Oh yeah, and when you're in Human form, other players can break into your world in the form of phantom invaders, hunt you down, and kill you for souls. You can also summon volunteer friendly players to assist, though, so it evens out."

I didn't have a job, nor was I in the work force, but I didn't want illegal aliens stealing jobs from ""real Americans."" I took this so far as to take German in high school, rather than taking Spanish, because ""this is our country, they should learn our language."" 

Cut to: getting my first job sophomore year. I started working as a bus boy at a casual dining chain. I was one of 4 bus boys, 2 of which were born in the US. Working there completely changed my view. I saw how hard of workers these guys were, often working 2 or more jobs to take care of their families and save up some money. I ended up moving into the kitchen, and started working even closer with the immigrants, knowing that at least a few of them were illegal.

Eventually, I decided that I wanted to make a career out of culinary. I'm going to spend the rest of my career surrounded by immigrants, and I know that they will not always have gotten here legally. That no longer bothers me. I do, however, regret taking German in high school. I had 3 choices for a foreign language, and chose the worst of the 3. Spanish would have been the most helpful, followed by French when working in a kitchen, but my prejudice steered me towards German."

shoryukenist,ShitAmericansSay,1390009908.0,"Actually I'm going just add some background on that.  By volume, you are indeed correct.  But most craft beer is quite strong, and therefore, much less of a volume is consumed.  For example, right now I'm drinking Sierra Nevada Torpedo, 7.2% ABV.  Coors Light is 4.2%.  There are many beers now around 9-10% that are quie drinkable.

The real measure is not volume, it is what is offered where.  I commute from the suburbs to Grand Central Terminal every night.  Before you get on your train, there is a mobile bar stand.  Even 7 years ago, your beer would be limited to Stella, Bud, Coors, Miller, Fosters and Corona.  Now there are local choices and national craft beers, and the best news?  Fosters is gone!  Fuck that shit!  

You can now go to your shittiest, old man, alchy dive, and fine good local beer.  Even some drunk old guy likes the idea of drinking a local beer.  Even baseball stadiums have good beer now. So anyway, we've made a lot of progress.

FWIW, I do not disparage European beer in anyway.  Fullers ESB and Meantime London Porter are some of my my absolute favorite beers, and I love Rochefort and Duvel as well."

polysyllabist,sanfrancisco,1390010473.0,"Some people are less connected with their pasts than others. You know those people from the small towns that never leave? They just can't, because there's something special they feel connected to? They watch their home town evolve over their lives and are fine, but quick dramatic change unsettles them.

It's not something isolated to small towns.

San Francisco is no different. Just like small towns there are those born and raised who felt deep strong connections and some that didn't. Some saw the city becoming impractical to live in, and left. Some saw opportunities elsewhere, saw another locale that better suited them, and they easily made the call to move.

Just as many with similar high objectivity / low connection ratios found it easy to leave their home towns and move to SF.

But the people born and raised here that stayed. The ones who do so despite how hard it is, even though there might be slightly better   opportunities for them elsewhere. They do so because connection is huge to them. They don't mind their city changing, but dramatic drastic change is repulsive to them.

It really shouldn't be surprising. Natives who stayed are largely the ones with a psychology skewed towards a rooted sense of connection, with a vested interest in how things were. Those who left their homes to come to SF are largely comprised of a psychology that views an ideal environment more objectivity.

Coexistence is possible, but you can't ram it down anyone's throat and expect your personal logic to resonate. On the one hand, the lives of SF residents would be cheaper with ten story homes in the sunset, on the other hand, if that's the sort of city you want to live in go make it for yourself somewhere else; don't steal it from a population who already has a city with their own ideal blend of charms.

Too many people coming here and deciding SF would be better 'if'. They aren't happy, we aren't happy (anymore)."

anonymousalex,childfree,1390010485.0,"&gt;Firstly, how many of you have partners/ plan to have partners? 

I'm getting married in a little over a week from now to my best friend and better half.  We've been together for more than 3 years.

&gt;Was the decision not to have children decided by both of you? 

Of course!  We are childfree for the foreseeable future, at the very least.  Neither of us have any desire to have kids, neither of us really like kids.  And I have a 5-year IUD that I plan on replacing as soon as I need to.  But we are both young (22 and 24) and know that, yes, things *could* change down the road...though it's unlikely.  We both love NOT having kids.  Plus...we don't even want to get a pet right now because of the expense!

As an aside, a relationship where only one partner decides to be childfree or to have children is probably not a relationship that will stand the test of time.  One will become resentful of the other, either for denying them the chance to be a parent or for forcing them to have a kid they don't want.


&gt;Secondly, what made you come to that decision? 

I've never had the desire to have kids.  Never really liked them.  Hated babysitting, and hated being told ""you'll change your mind when you're older.""  Kids are shitty.  And expensive.  And I have way cooler things I could be doing with my life.


&gt;Also, tell me your racial background if you don't mind sharing that information.

We're both white, from solidly middle-class families; he's the middle of 3 kids, I'm the youngest of 2.  He was raised Catholic and I was raised in some weird non-denominational Christian hodgepodge church.  We're both atheists."

colossusgb,AskReddit,1390010815.0,"One time I had a dream that my two friends and I, lets call them John and Chris, got stranded on a desert planet that had roughly the same type of terrain as Afghanistan. We each an an M4 rifle because we were trained in the Army. This story took place in 3rd person.



The sun was going down and it was giving an amber glow to the mountainscape when we notice a short figure (4ft?) in a purple Robe standing up in the mountains. At this point, my friends and I were terrified. We knew this planet was known for what was call the Rashada, a group of Purple-robe wearing demons that feasted on the flesh of men who got lost in their mountains. We had to run.



We noticed a small cave to our left and took off running. The purple figure jumps down from the mountain and blocks our path. We battle but not before he injures all of us quite seriously with feral claws that are about a foot long on each finger. Eventually, we lay it to waste with our weapons and we all stumble into the cave bleeding out. As we lay on the ground dying the floor gives out from under us and we fall about 15 feet into what appears to be a room with an altar.



I don't know how but I know this altar is what is going to save our lives. My friends have seemingly blacked out from the fall but I summon all my strength and begin crawling toward the altar that is 20ft away. The sounds of footsteps fill the halls around us. I know the Rashada are coming. There are 7 exits out of the chamber we fell into and the Purple robed demons begin pouring into the room as I crawl upon the altar. My blood flows into the crevices and the altar begins to shine bright white. The Rashada cover their eyes as bright white lights shoot into me and my two friends.



The lights fade and my friends and I are standing again in the middle of the room completely rejuvenated. The Rashada rush us with their razor sharp claws. Many of their hoods fall down revealing what looks like mutilated humanoids with bright red eyes and razor sharp teeth. More than 100 of the 4ft demons jump on us in a dog pile and it seems all is lost. All of a sudden something of great strength throws all the demons covering us off of us. John has somehow developed super strength and begins fighting off the demons. Their razor sharp claws scratch at his skin but bounce off like styrofoam. Soon the demons begin to overtake us again. As I am passing out I see Chris raise into the air as if he is levitating. His eyes begin to shine crimson red. The Rashada halt their assault as they stare in awe at the power of this stranger. All of a sudden Red beams of light shoot from Chris's eyes at our assailants ripping flesh from bone and spraying blood across the chamber. The beams tear through our enemies like a hot knife through butter. All of a sudden the view turns dark and everything seems to stop as if someone paused a videogame. The words ""CHAOS GIVES YOU LASER EYES"" appear over the darkness in crimson letters in a font that looks like it was blood running down a wall.



The scene unpauses and the tumultuous battle ends swiftly from this laser vision that my friend has received from this altar that seemingly gave us each CHAOS powers.



My wounds heal swiftly as I have received some type of health regeneration. We spend hours wandering aimlessly through the halls of this place and finally stumble upon a door that looks different than all the others with the initials D.H.H.D. written in the stonework. We decided to go in. Within the door is a man standing behind a counter with an abundance of weapons hanging from the walls : swords, flails, axes, bows, crossbows, spears, and other such things. The man hails us as the Chaos warriors and tells us of a prophecy of three human men that arrive on the planet to save it from the demon menace that inherit the powers of CHAOS. The weapons on his walls are the choices we are allowed to make as we will need them because we can't always rely on CHAOS. We choose are weapons and are about to leave when he wishes us well and tells us to return to Demon Hunter Home Depot for all of our demon killing needs.



We leave the store in order to fulfill the prophecy."

Today, after our morning meeting, I had a discussion with my boss about a problematic alert on a production system and pushed him to have the director of that division re-evaluate the alert threshold. 

I addressed three or four issues where disks were filling up, traced one of them to log spam due to a missing directory, and wrote a quick fix in Chef that I pushed out to all of the servers. Log traffic dropped by about 5% globally. 

The guy responsible for data interchange (EDI) pinged me. We started getting bad messages from a partner a few hours before. To rule out a problem in our systems before we called them, I looked at the x12 payloads on the EDI server cluster, and then used tcpdump and wireshark to capture and analyze a few to make sure we weren't incidentally mangling them somehow. We weren't, so I wrote up my findings and participated in a brief conference call to with the data interchange partner to help them troubleshoot their systems. 

We're on a big documentation kick, so my boss started to nag me about updating documentation and especially diagrams that had fallen out of date. I spent a few hours after lunch to appease him. 

Another one of my coworkers is implementing graphite for metrics collection, so I spent a couple hours helping him at the end of the day to break out the necessary parts into different VMs and get Chef roles written to get the proper cookbooks and recipes on these hosts. 

It was the end of the day, but before I went home*, I still wanted to spend an hour working on the update to our chef-client install. We have a few hundred machines to update, and I'm trying to figure out a short term plan to get them updated NOW to something a bit more recent, and a long term plan to get them updated to a sane version. It's something of a dependency hell that I've been chipping at for weeks, and I feel bad if I don't work on it a little bit every day. "

mczbot,soccer,1390011298.0,"wolfsburg sits on huge potential since years already, but it seems with the addition of allofs it finally made ""click"" for them.

since we have a huge amount of foreigners, from a german standpoint, here i think theres a need to clarify this especially. compared to other citys in germany, especially in the bundesliga, wolfsburg itself is rather small with just ~200.000 inhabitants. it's been founded in the second world war as city for the workers of the no vw factorys. so essentially, wolfsburg is vw. and as such, wolfsburg as a football club, is a great marketing tool for vw itself. what's even better for the club is that vw's chairman, winterkorn, is a football fanatic and has been on the board for bayern. vw used to (and i think they still have) big shares in bayern already, but lately they started giving more money to wolfsburg aswell. it's pretty much the closest you can get to a ""suggardaddy"" in the bundesliga. 
with that in mind, wolfsburg already invested a ton of money in their youth facilitys, which are now one of the best in germany. however, with how the youth leagues are structured in germany (they are divided in 3 regional leagues with playoffs at the end), wolfsburg location grants them another advantage: they are the only good youthacademy in the north with only hansa rostock having another good one, who however cant even remotely compete with wolfsburg on financial terms. so they are able to get a lot of the youngsters who would previously transfer either to academys in the netherlands or in the ruhrgebiet.

and now with allofs transfer policy of spending the lionshare of the bugdet on one worldclass player instead of 6 promising ones and incooperating the youthplayers with a coach like hecking, there is effectively only growth in wolfsburg. it's a reality the other bundesliga clubs have to face, because financially, none of us bar bayern can compete with wolfsburg. it's in my opinion only a matter of time until wolfsburg cements its place as a title contender for years to come.
and to be fair, i cant even be that mad about it, because it's not a foreign sheik comming in splashing out a ton of cash, but instead it's a company that is not just locally routed in wolfsburg, but effectively is the only reason for wolfsburg existance, supporting the club.

i mean, we dont know how long it will take for wolfsburg to play catchup with the other clubs in terms of the potential within the squad. it could take one year, two years, maybe even five. but it's pretty much garantueed that if they keep on following the path they just entered that they will become one of the strongest clubs within germany, if not europe. unless vw pulls out of the project that is.

what however could hinder their progress - and in turn make the bundesliga really exciting would be dortmund managing to keep on stabilizing and growing financially and us sticking to the plan of being debtfree by 2018. then we would have 4 really financially stable and strong clubs within germany and the extremely well managed leverkusen competing on a relative leveled playing field (with ofcourse bayern still having a leg up on everyone else that is)."

The more likely answer is that you do not know much about beer, and are simply parroting old tropes, and now claiming that beer is too subjective to evaluate.

Instead of having the strike emanating from the galaxy, I think it would be cooler if the galaxy dropped some sort of big obvious targeting beacon that the enemy had maybe 10-20 seconds or so to destroy or run from before a large area of effect orbital blast came out of the sky. 

The health of the beacon and the time it took to go off would have to be tinkered with to make it balanced but the idea would be to make it powerful enough to take out medium size clusters of troops/vehicles, able to be destroyed by combined fire by large clusters, and not worth using against small clusters.  Artillery of some kind is a common tool of war but this way the defenders wouldn't have to deal with an attacker they couldn't see. They'd have a chance to destroy the galaxy or the beacon before it went off.

Hopefully we'll get galaxies with the ability to carry a vehicle at some point, this wouldn't be hard to add at the same time. The balance would be hard though. Would it be able to take out an MBT or sunderer with one hit? What about a Vanguard with it's shield up?"

EauRougeFlatOut,aviation,1390012467.0,"There are literally 0 instances on any Airbus aircraft where the three hydraulic systems have failed to keep the control surfaces in play. However, there have been aircraft from other manufacturers who have built the same redundancy into their aircraft and it failed to prevent a complete hydraulic failure (looking at you, McDonnell Douglas). Airbus has come *very* close to having accidents due to the hydraulic lines being severed, and I think it's time that they consider implementing a similar system to what Boeing has on the 737.

This is just one complaint I can levy against Airbus. Another would be the overly complicated nature of their FBW computers and what they do in certain situations. It is the general opinion in the industry that the crash of AF447 was due in no small part to the complexity of the system and the pilots' failure to understand the same. Because pilots are not initially trained on FBW aircraft (in fact I think it's fair to say that &gt;80% of commercial and ATP pilots have not had training on envelope-limiting FBW aircraft at all), flying an Airbus does not always feel natural to an inexperienced pilot, which unfortunately a lot of copilots (who often are left to their devices by a sleeping or otherwise indisposed captain) are.

Note that these complaints are quite minor and either completely hypothetical or easily fixable through modernization of maintenance/training procedure. I would also like to note that I am in no way biased against Airbus, as I certainly have my own string of complaints to levy against Boeing. However I felt that your initial comment made the A320 out to be a safer aircraft than the 737. It is not, nor is the 737 necessarily any safer than the A320.

Edit: Upon further research, the A380, 787, and newer have electro hydrostatic actuators built into the control surfaces in case of a hydraulic failure. These do not continue to function in the event of a dual electrical and hydraulic failure, but that is a reasonably large margin of safety in my opinion."

Football games, business expansions, colonization attempts... They just think that their enemies are going to roll over and it'll be easy. Then they look fucking clueless when it blows up in their faces. Over and over and over again."
msbubbles326,weddingplanning,1390012502.0,"My husband and I had no kids. It caused a little drama with a bridesmaid who dropped out of the wedding. She was pissy she didn't get her way. We ended up not even inviting her to the wedding. Just about everyone took our side in this little ""battle"" because most people understand that children aren't always invited to weddings. In our case it was an evening wedding, so even more reason that kids wouldn't be invited. We stuck to our guns and only had that one problem. We gave people 5-6 months with the save-the-dates to find a sitter. 

It's your wedding and you don't want kids there. There is no reason that a parent shouldn't be able to understand this or accept it. Yes, there may be people who choose not to attend because of it, it happens, but it's not going to ruin your wedding if they don't show up. You're still going to have an amazing day!"

Hatguy115,AskMen,1390012548.0,"Every time. I love my parents. My mom has sacrificed so much time, money, and comfort to help me, even today at the age of 23. In my ten year career in baseball my dad missed less then ten games overall, and was always the one voice I could hear when I was out there pitching. When my career ended abruptly he was the one who helped me through it all. I never miss a chance to tell them I love them."

AssociationFootball,BMW,1390012562.0,"You never really know an individual's financial situation, but i can say that my brother, after his first deployment came back and bought 350z that he ended up having to sell in less than one year at a major loss (not sure the circumstances).  

Then he bought a 328i, brand spanking new loaded out, for slightly less than 50k.  I about choked when i heard that.  Hes an E-5.  I bought a 335i CPO that was three years old for almost 20k less.  I make a solid 6-figure salary and couldnt imagine spending 50k on a car on an E-5 salary.  But then again maybe his bonuses and deployment pay or whatever other perks military folks get are that good?  

On the other hand my brother in law quit college after his sophomore year at NYU to join the army, hes plowed his money into paying off his student loans and is currently looking to buy his first car, his budget: 10k.   "
