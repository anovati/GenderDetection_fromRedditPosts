sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388768694.0,"Why does anyone want independence?  They have been convinced whatever problems they have would magically improve if they were a separate country free to manage their own affairs and make their own choices.  History hasn't really borne that out as all that successful when you're not talking about oppressed colonies, but that doesn't really matter.  

The Scottish Nationalists feel that their north sea oil money is being sent to london  at their expense, and they feel they are culturally distinct from england.  Englands position towards the EU, particularly when led by the conservative party, is not a particularly good vision (leave or join, half and half doesn't work well for anyone).  


Unlike say, Ireland, who were oppressed for being catholic for a long time  under British rule, that sort of thing is long gone in Scotland, decades of transfer payments from London have made  sure scotland has a viable education system and access to good markets, and they've had full representation in parliament for centuries.  


Imagine for a minute you live in,  say, manchester, a labour stronghold (I think), and you're a Labour supporter, doesn't really matter where, but a Labour stronghold and a Labour supporter.  Well right now there's a conservative government, so if you separated from the UK and made your own Kingdom of Manchester you'd have a labour government.  And for the next 4 years you'd think yourself better off than if  you'd stayed as part of the UK.  Because who really wants to put up with having the guy you didn't vote for, or the policy you didn't vote for in charge? 

Of course 4 years from now, you have another election, and the conservatives within your new Kingdom of Manchester decide that if you can have independence from Conservative england, they can have independence from Conservative Manchester and you end up with no end of problems.  Independence is very narrow short term thinking.  "

Gl33m,AskReddit,1388768713.0,"Everyone/everything listed absolutely *does* affect them. Things really popular in society have an affect on people. Take Justin Bieber, he's a role model for the 8-18 demographic (generalized numbers, but you get my point). His music is very influential over those people. His behavior is watched and emulated by them. If his music has shitty messages, or his actions exemplify douchey behavior, it's exerted over a population very open to influence. Those people are going to be the new functioning members of society very soon. I'd really rather not have them latching onto that. Miley Cyrus is an even better example. Oh god...

But getting past that, popular entertainment begets popular entertainment. How many spinoffs did Twilight (and its fanfiction 50 Shades of Grey) churn out? I mean, teen-paranormal-romance is now a genre... I like to speak about this in terms of video games, as that's the media type I know the best. The reason why so many gamers hate CoD and Battlefield isn't just because they're ""bad"" games. It's because, in spite of their being ""bad"" they're still popular. That popularity leads to a ton of companies churning out terrible, shoddy, thrown-together CoD clones. And suddenly the medium is flooded with a poor product imitating these two games. It's a stagnation of creativity. Ultimately, entertainment isn't there to entertain you. It's there to make money (yay capitalism!), and because of it people go with what they predict makes money. So, in short, Justin Bieber and Twilight being terrible, but also popular, reduces the number of people producing quality content I actually enjoy, because they're all jumping on the bandwagon of whatever's popular."

Look, in the ""old days"" (i.e. 40-60 years ago) a smart, well-educated man who went to an Ivy League university would marry a smart, well-educated woman from one of the Seven Sisters, and then she would be a housewife. Nowadays, something similar still happens to some degree, but much less. I have seen women who want the equivalent: a smart, well-educated man who is willing to be a househusband.

&gt;  What kind of smart man doesn't have a higher-income job?

**That is the whole point of this article.** Its still ""not OK"" for a smart man to not have a higher-income job. Why aren't there smart, well-educated men who would prefer to take care of the house. spend time with their kids, and pursue their hobbies? What's wrong with that? Why shouldn't they prefer that to the tedious accounting job they could otherwise get? There are certainly women like that. *But there is a lot of stigma against that.* And in my opinion, that's why they can't be found; due to the societal pressures, any man who is smart / well-educated enough to get a good job feels that being a househusband would make him ""not a man""."

In many countries midwives cannot provide certain services without the assistance of a physician, those services could include use of an epidural, an episiotomy, or instrumentation assisted births.  Therefore the sample would naturally self select.  Anyone requiring medical intervention (which seems to be identified as a ""negative"" outcome) would have to use the services of a doctor and would therefore be excluded from the group who received care exclusively from a midwife.  Even if someone presented high risk symptoms which were later resolved and they went on to receive care from a midwife, they might have required care from a physician to address their early symptoms which would place them in the combined category.

Finally, the last sentence of the abstract: 

&gt;[caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications.](http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD004667/midwife-led-continuity-models-versus-other-models-of-care-for-childbearing-women#sthash.RjlhV8IV.QoOfkiWr.dpuf)

Indicates that there is an acknowledged discrepancy in the level of care available and the care required for high risk patients which would support my suspician that the population is self selecting type of care based on likely outcomes.

I would also note that none of the trials included ""lay midwives"", which is not clearly defined, nor did they include out of hospital births.  Which has some serious implications for the applicability of these results to the model of midwife care available in North America."

Like you said, it *is* really hard to sort through emotions and having a wall to bounce stuff off of is great.

Just be there for your girlfriend. Listen to what she has to say. Take care of her before and after. Each woman recovers from an abortion differently. Maybe look into therapy for the both of you if you feel it's needed.  Don't panic if she flip flops between decisions. I did several times as it's a head and heart battle. In the end I knew I made the right choice and am happy with it.

Depending on how far she is I recommend for her to try to take a few prenatal vitamins anyway. A growing baby no matter how small it is can suck a lot of nutrients from her, leaving her body pretty wrecked. I think my recovery went so well because I took care of myself so well while there was still a tiny human in me.

In  Europe most governments have partial ownership stakes in all sorts of stuff, car companies, aircraft  manufacturers, farming etc.  



In a Communist state (say soviet russia) the means of production, both the  land and the goods produced are owned by the state and then sold both domestically and internationally.

Fluxxed0,magicTCG,1388769500.0,"I run GW aggro, both in paper and online.  In paper, I have Voices.  I don't have them online, and I run Call of the Conclave as a replacement.  So hey, I can actually answer your question with 200+ matches of experience.

Esper control is a hard matchup for you, because you have to avoid over-extending into a Verdict.  Voices are critical here, because they give you some Wrath protection.  When your opponent board wipes, you can drop a Selesnya Charm knight token at end of turn, and you're beating for 4 (with the knight and the elemental token) on the next turn with no real tempo loss.  Centaurs are just beaters.

Voice is better against mono-B, but CotC works fine here.  Voices force the black player to main-phase his removal, and the Voices themselves take two cards to kill... but the Centaurs can attack into Nightveil Specter and Gary, and it takes more Pack Rat tokens to hold off the Centaurs.

In the mono-U matchup, I almost prefer the Centaurs.  Centaurs can attack through Specters and 2/3 Raptors, and with a Spear of Heliod in play, they attack through Frostburn Weird as well.  Weird is a stone wall to your Voices, which is really bad for you.  I also want to be very aggressive in the mono-U matchup, so the extra point of power on the Centaur is just good all around.

Voice is terrible against WWx.  Soldier of the Pantheon destroys it (even the elemental token is multicolor), it can't block Precinct Captain, and it doesn't handle Reckoner well.  It's also useful to have mono-color creatures in this matchup to help play around Brave the Elements.  Call of the Conclave is the clear winner here.

You're weak to Green Devotion, and Voice is a dead card in that matchup.  Centaurs can at least attack through Sylvan Caryatids, which lets you apply some early pressure and keeps them from dropping an early Garruk.  But honestly, you're dead to this deck anyway, so don't worry too much about it.

Against RDW or Barely Boros, it depends on your opponent's deck list.  A turn 2 Centaur can block Ash Zealot or tangle with a Boros Reckoner, both of which blank your Voice.  Centaur is also better against lists that run Frostburn Weird, for the same reasons as above.  However, a Voice gives you two blockers against BTE and Rakdos Cackler, and always puts your opponent on the back foot by making him play his removal on his own turn (so he can't burn+first strike your attackers to death).  Either is fine.

Final verdict:  You can play GW aggro without Voices and still do ok.  Your worst matchups (Esper and Big Green) get worse, the mono-B matchup gets a little worse, but you're actually a bit better off in some cases.  "

OriginalStomper,bestof,1388769593.0,"Of course you or I could concoct a ""definition"" of deity which can be [dis]proven.  But then, what have we accomplished?  Isn't that just tautology?

&gt;the Judeo-Christian deity has many acts ascribed to it that are observable (e.g., parting of the Red Sea) and would be perfectly suited as inductive proof (though not absolute proof). It also has several qualities that are suited to logical disproof, which Epicurus aptly demonstrated quite some time ago. So that deity is both provable and disprovable.

Only if you insist on taking those stories and qualities literally.  For example, ancient writers could have used terms like omniscient and omnipotent as a shorthand for ""very wise and powerful beyond our understanding or ability to adequately describe.""

&gt;This advice is useless to the believer because you are considering only your non-definition of a deity, not the believer's definition.

Actually, EVERY believer I know will agree that his or her deity expects faith.  Most have not thought about this enough to realize that this precludes an empirical proof of their deity's existence.  Most have just enough education to believe that their deity's existence is something that ought to be tested scientifically.  Then they perceive a false ""war"" between science and religion rather than question the underlying assumptions."

That doesn't make me a bigot. My brother is everything to me, he is my best friend, if he denied coming to my wedding because of the gender I was attracted to I'd be beyond heartbroken.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388770762.0,"In addition to people talking about a century of data on weather, there are also techniques for going further  back in time to get average climates over time.  As a simple example, if a tree puts on a new ring every year, and in warm  years the ring is thicker than in colder years you can go find some trees, or some lumber made from trees from a particular time period, measure the rings and off you go.  Naturally you want to have a fairly large sample size from a relatively wide area for this sort of thing to work.  There are  bore holes in Arctic and Antarctic that have ice deposits for many hundreds to small thousands of years, there's archaeological evidence etc. etc. etc. 

Combined together you can get a decent picture of past climate behaviour.  That doesn't  mean you know whether or not there was rain on Timbuktu on January 3 874, but you can probably figure out if the 870-880 period saw above or below average rainfall in and temperatures in the Niger river area along the  southern edge of the Sahara.

piggybankcowboy,amateurradio,1388770891.0,"Terribly. But I'm going to take that dismay, and turn it into productive energy by refocusing it towards new (or rehashed, haha) goals. 

Antennas - I managed to put together two last year, so I learned a bit there, but not nearly enough for a gold star, in my opinion. I've got a fresh book, and managed to acquire some odds and ends for future projects, and those will be in rotation on my weekend downtime. 

Exploring Arduino + Radio - Again, I did some very basic, small stuff, and got side tracked. Time for another push. 

Get on the air more - last year I wasn't so focused on this, because I wanted to learn the technical side of things. Plus, I'm very mic-shy. Like, extremely so. I don't even leave voicemails on people's cells because I hate the way my voice sounds. On top of that, I still feel intimidated due to lack of experience, and hey, there's only one way to solve that; get on the air. 

License upgrade - I missed the last testing date in my area last year, but I still don't feel 100% confident with the knowledge, so my goal is to upgrade by my birthday this year. I don't just want to memorize the answers like I did with tech (well, it was more half memorization, half understanding). When I'm a General class, I want to *know* what I'm talking about. 

Have fun - well, mission accomplished, last year, even with what little I did in radio :) Might as well keep that goal going this year!"

It tends to be more anti-women, sort of like the feminist movement can be anti-men. Masculinists might argue things like that men should have a legal say in women getting abortions, which is something I can't get on board with.

I like the way The Amazing Atheist put it in one of his videos on feminism (I forget which one) in that we might be better off not saying we're feminist or masculinist, but just for gender equality. (though we could get even more semantic and say that we're not pushing for ""equality"" as though 50% exactly of men should be effeminate and 50% of women masculine, rather ""acceptance""... but I think that's just getting picky)"

I bet he does not enjoy sitting at home without a job everyday with you probably holding that debt over his head which most likely just makes him feel worse.  If that is a huge issue with you then forget it and it'll be like it never happened. If you keep track of the money you use on your SO you will put a price on the relationship. Your relationship seems to be worth $6000. That's a pretty small investment for a relationship if you stuck with it for someone that seems to care a lot about you.

You really don't.  Laundry baskets make perfect bassinets.  Receiving blankets are easy to make at home.  The floor makes for a great changing table.  Nurseries are overrated.

2. You won't know what you need to splurge on until you meet your baby anyway.  Maybe you've got a chill baby and a cheapo baby bouncer will be more than good enough.  Maybe you've got a psycho demon child and that $350 swing will be an absolute necessity.  But you won't know until you meet them.

3. The best use of your time pre-baby is not preparing your home, it is preparing your relationship/marriage.  Enjoy the time before they arrive.

4. Shop sales in advance, it doesn't have to be as expensive as it is.  I have a strict $5 rule for baby clothes, if it costs more than $5 per item (ie per onesie or sleeper or shirt) it is too expensive.

5. Think twice about colors and patterns.  It's easy to just buy pink or blue, but there is so much more out there than Daddy's Little Slugger and Mommy's Princess.

For me now, home is both Norway and Czech Republic, but it's shifting more and more towards Norway as I've not lived in Czech Republic for almost a decade now.

You sound very much like me before I left Czech Republic in my teens, I felt like I never belonged there being of half Russian descent and that home was nowhere. But then, faced with a different culture, you realize that you are more ""Czech"" or ""American"" or whatever than you ever thought. Right now, I'm feeling the transition again, but now I feel more and more out of place when I go back to Czech Republic to visit my parents and friends and suddenly I see the seeds of Norway that have taken root in my attitude, lifestyle and behavior without me even realizing. Still, I'll always be Czech in some ways and I'll always be Russian in some tiny ways, but home will soon be only Norway."

ChibiOne,asktransgender,1388772165.0,"Pre-HRT I felt like I was nearly always horny, and masturbated at least once most days, and probably had at least a mild pron addiction.  Now, 6.5 months in, I don't masturbate at all, don't get any sort of random or morning erections, haven't looked at porn in several months, and completely don't miss any of it at all.

That said, when my partner and I start snuggling and they start to kiss and caress...MMMMM HMMMMM.  All systems are go!  \*\^_\^\*  

In fact, for me, making love now is to pre-HRT sex as pre-HRT sex was to masturbation.  I'm still pre-op, but luckily I've never been hugely dysphoric of my genitals.  I don't *like* them, and I'll be glad to swap them out...but, they work for now, and pleasure is pleasure.  My partner is super considerate of the issue, and doesn't focus much on that part any more than is necessary.

What I have found, that was a real surprise to me, is how much I love being submissive in bed.  My partner is generally happy to be the aggressor, and it's freakin' magical how it makes me feel to be pinned down and manhandled.  I always knew that trying to fill a male role in bed was lessening my enjoyment, but I had *no idea* how much till I had it the other way.  To be able to simply relax and totally give my self to the experience is one of the most profoundly powerful experiences transition has brought me.  And I anticipate it only getting better post-op, when the remaining, ah, issue is resolved.  =)"

See the thing about extinction events is typically the survivors do so because they are resistant to the executioner.  Like if you had a race of bugs in various shades of grey, if a forest fire swept through the darker bugs would be more likely to survive because they'd blend in better with the ash.  Or after the black plague ended, the majority of the survivors were resistant or immune to it.  So something in that extinction event wiped out not just us, but also competitors that could have prevented us from spreading out from Africa."

In my social circle boyfriend/girlfriend means exclusive unless you specify otherwise, so it works just as well. I've done this several times as I'm not really comfortable with assuming.

I've never run into an issue with it, to be honest. The other person usually says, ""Do you want me/us to be?"" and I say that I do, and they've usually agreed. A few times they've sort of hemmed and hawed and I've said that we can talk about it later, and then when I bring it up again a week or two later they agree. I've never had anyone give a definite no.

If the conversation was prompted by another person showing interest or asking me out, I just mention that. ""I'm just asking because so-and-so wants to go out next weekend and I wasn't sure what to tell him."" That usually speeds up the decision process if he's not sure.

gingerkid1234,linguistics,1388773099.0,"&gt;So what does this have to do with accents? When you learn your particular language, you are acutely aware of the relevant types of distinctions that your language makes. Accents consist of minor variations in what ""choice"" the language group makes with regard to these types of distinctions. So a Bostonian will pronounce the last syllable in ""tuner"" with a vowel and no coda: 'nuh' ([nə] -I think), and ""tuna"" with something akin to a rhotic: 'ner' ([nəɹ]). (To my ears, it's a little ""lighter"" but that's not relevant and I suck at phonology anyway). She will ""make this choice"" consistently based on the phonological environment of the morpheme in question. I, and many other English speakers, ""make the 'opposite' choice,"" i.e. we switch which string of sounds is used for those two phonemes. This difference and a number of others are what constitute different accents.

This isn't correct.  Tuna and tuner are homophonous in non-rhotic dialects, including that of Boston.  The addition of /ɹ/ has to do with the phonetic environment (specifically, whether a vowel follows of not), and nothing to do with what the word itself is.  The /ɹ/ is the ""linking r"", not part of the word's phonology."

The cool thing about this internet currencies is that they are much easier to convert than fiat currency. Someone may be skeptical of doge coin, but show them the conversion to BTC and they'll be listening.

That being said I think this is the true value of dogecoin, switching between it and BTC. We need to stop thinking in terms of dollar, and in terms of BTC conversion. As BTC rises in value, we want dogecoin to equally rise.

There are many girls who will hang out with guys, and that doesnt mean anything. So if she was there with more than one dude, maybe she wasnt seeing anyone of them. Ok hold on, im kinda hungoer so imma cut to the chase. Do not approach her at the table, it will be extremely weird and awkward, unless you're all game, but since you're asking for advice in reddit I guess not.  Wait for her to go to the bathroom, the bar, something like that where she is alone and then commence the conversation. And dont try to be too obvious that you are trying to bang her, be more friendlier than flirty (especially since she's the only female with the guys, and sometime they cant get overprotective about the most stupid shit ever.) 

If she is really checking you out as you say, she will try to get appart from the guys for a while, and thats your cue, go and talk to her.

You're putting too much emphasis on looks and physical attraction, it's like you think the only way a relationship can work is if you're both good looking. The reality is that while guys and girls alike will always be attracted to each other, if your boyfriend is a good guy he's just harmlessly looking, and it's not because he finds you any less attractive. It's not about you at all. That's where the naive thing comes in. You think because he thinks another girl is attractive you won't be able to hold onto him and that's not correct. 

Relationships are about more than physical attraction, while it is a vital part for **most** people, it's not the entirety of why two people get together. You need to grow up and realize that.

LolaRuns,Games,1388774018.0,"Is it censorship to print an English speaking author one time with favourite and one time with favorite depending on whether it is released in the US or in the UK? 

Is it censorship to fix a typo? 

If the orignal intent of the game is to say ""barely legal, but still legal"" or ""slightly above legal"" then it makes sense to change it so that will be understood. 

Like a movie might have a character speaking with a Texan accent but the German dub might change it to a Bavarian accent. In some movies maybe it actually matters that the character is actually Texan (like maybe he wears a cowboy hat and spores) while in other situations (like in a cartoon movie with only animals) the *intent* of the scene is to say ""this is a funny country bumpkin"" and every country replaces ""Texan"" with whoever the stereotypical country bumpkins are in their country. 

In the end, it doesn't look like anybody forced them to make their change, they probably made the change themselves either for the sake of being understood or for the sake of a lower rating=more money. Why value their so called artistic integrity more than they do themselves? 

Games and movies are constantly changed to fit various countries sensibilities like Germany's requirement for lower violence versions or Australia's requirements for the portrayal of drugs (only in those country the changes actually ARE mandated by some sort of offcial body rather than companies doing it preemptively potentially for money reasons). Most of those countries would even allow the games to be released in their original form, as long as you are willing to take the higher rating. And everyone can make a stand on their vision (like MGS with Quiet) but if they didn't that probably is a sign that it wasn't that integral to their vision in the first place. "

Awkward_moments,explainlikeimfive,1388774136.0,"You mixed up the rugby and football fans here. The reasons you put down are for USA and football (British) fans being different is opposite to football (British) and rugby. Its not comparable.

The reasons you have said for why there is no hooligans in USA is different to why there are no hooligans in rugby.

You can drink in rugby stadiums, you cannot drink in football stadiums.

You mentioned British football wasnt professional, meaning its more violent. Well rugby union (the bigger one) went professional in 1995.

In Britain usually people start playing football at a younger age. So the family aspect of watching the sport and making it less violent applies more to football than to rugby. 

The best way to explain lack of rugby hooligans is the quote ""Football is a gentleman's game played by hooligans, and rugby is a hooligans' game played by gentlemen"" 

And this is very much the case. In rugby the fighting is done on the pitch. In football the fighting is done off the pitch. Rugby is very much what happens on the pitch stays on the pitch. You have a game try kick the shit out of the other team then full time whistle you shake hands and go have a shower. After that you get your shoes, trousers, shirt and tie on and go for a pint and a meal in the home teams club house TOGETHER. Have a drink and a laugh, no fighting then go home.

Rugby started as an upper-class game. And has remained like that since. In certain ways it has the old proper Britishness that as largely degraded in other areas.

I was talking to someone who was a football fan. And my country Wales had a big game against France so it was big news and I was telling this guy about the game. I told him my dad had two tickets and took a Frenchman. The footballer asked me what side they sat on. So a little confused I replied ""you know where player X scored the try, well they was in that corner"" 

""oh right but who was they sitting with?""

""um ... randomers. Just the two of them went""

""yea but what area?""

This conversation went on for a while, both of us being unable to understand each other we gave up. I later realised he assumed rugby fans get split up to avoid fighting (like in football). As a rugby fan that thought never crossed my mind. Part of the spirt of rugby is being a gentleman to the other team. I wouldnt ever consider fans getting separated and he wouldnt consider fans not getting separated. I found it funny. Fans are completely different in the sports. Towns get literally split in two by the police for football fans. In rugby everyone drinks in the same pubs, no problem. "

OlderThanGif,askscience,1388774645.0,"I don't think the ASIC analogy is a very good one.

Imagine a world without any physical computers at all. There have been decades of academic research into digital computers (what sort of logic gates would be needed, what instructions they would perform, what algorithms you could write for them that would perform well, what programming languages might be developed for them, etc.) but no one's actually managed to build a commercial digital computer yet.

Then out of nowhere some company comes out with an [analog computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer) and says ""look! We built the first computer!"" It *could* be that this new computer is great, but it's not anything like what people had been publishing papers on for decades. And even worse, imagine that the company is secretive about the mechanics of their analog computer so the community at large isn't really sure what operations it performs or how it stores its data.

That's *sort of* where we are. A company's come out with something and called it a ""quantum computer"" but it's not anything like how we've been trying to produce quantum computers before. All of the work we've done trying to come up with neat algorithms and programming languages and stuff doesn't have any relevance to this new computer. We don't know exactly what this new computer is capable of or not capable of.

To be clear, I'm not trying to say that D-Wave computers are analog and traditional quantum-gate computers are digital. Both models use qubits.

LolaRuns,Games,1388774655.0,"But sex with adult women and sex with children is a very different subject. Just because Europeans are potentially super-cool with sex with adult women like in The Witcher doesn't mean they are all also in favor of sex/sexyness with girls below voting age. (I'm bringing up Germany because Germany is a big market and pretty vocal when it comes to what they want and don't want and hold a lot of sway) 

=&gt; my explanation is to say that while there is a lot of sex on European tv for example (like adult woman naked titties and ass at 9pm in a popular crime show drama or naked penis on public billboards) there might actually be less portrayal of young people sex and sexyness because of child actor labor laws (compared to let's say the various Disney actresses or singers being actual teens). Hence, if it's not something that is common in normal media maybe there would be a chance that they would be weirded out seeing it in fictional media as well. 

And there's of course the theory that maybe being drawn to young people might be related to societies that are more sexually repressed. (of course it happens everywhere, but it might be more frequent in those environments  (like you know, the Catholic church) =&gt; I would argue that any society with some whacked out ideas about purity is more likely to have stuff like/versions of that in their popular media (regardless of how many people actually practice it).

Otherwise, I call them JW's, Elders, Governing Body (GB for short), Jehovah, etc...

The reason being, is that sometimes it might feel difficult being critical of the Society and the organization's structure. There might be lingering effects of being raised not to take god's name in vain or to not be critical of the teachings of the Society. It might feel easier to use slang terms so that one feels one isn't *really* being critical of the actual thing. 

But this aversion conversely gives *the thing* more power. It's like Voldemort's name in the Harry Potter books. I don't want Jehovah, Governing Body, Watchtower, or Society to be my ""Voldemort"", if you will. 

While slang has it's place, and I enthusiastically engage in swearing, I also refuse to accept that using the word Jehovah for the JW god in a critical statement is taboo.

It is *really* nice to not have masturbation be, like, the first thing I think of doing every time I find myself alone.

Also, currently I am very, very lucky to have an active sex life with a very loving and talented partner.  My experiences with them make any kind of masturbation seem so pale in comparison, I'd rather save any sexual energy for our intimate times together.  Without the massive drive -- need, even -- to do so ""whether I want to or not"", I have generally just not felt a drive to masturbate.  

If I were single, I'm quite sure that would be different, but even then it would be far, far less often than in my previous life.  I know because I was single for the first 4 months of HRT, and only occasionally felt like masturbating.  Not in a bad way, like ""ugh!  masturbation, no way!""  It's just that...other things sounded more fun or important and so I'd just do those and not masturbate, no angst or hard feelings towards the activity.

If we allow the government to stomp on businesses and change laws like this... who is going to want to do business in the USA?  Would YOU build a business knowing that the government is wont to change the laws on you?"
TheDissoluteCity,AdviceAnimals,1388775417.0,"I'm not sure about that--I saw some fairly smart people get sucked in on this near the beginning of the ""controversy."" It's not as though big pharmaceutical companies generally give off the appearance of having the public's best interest at heart, so it wasn't that much of a reach to suspect they might be manipulating information about vaccines. Add to this the fact that a prominent medical journal in 1998 published an article allegedly verifying the link between vaccines and autism, and I think it was pretty understandable for people to get pulled in, regardless of what their doctors were saying.

Of course, at this point, the evidence paints a very stark picture in favor of vaccines, but old fears die hard, and people have been rewarded before for distrusting corporations."

SovietRaptor,totalwar,1388775430.0,"I don't really use Kisho Ninja's in open field battles. You can try deploying them behind enemy lines and then using their grenades to pick off the enemy general but often they get charged and killed. You also might consider using them in conjunction with cavalry. Most of the time I just keep them in a second line and use them to support units that need a boost.

Kisho ninja really excel in siege battles. For one, Kisho ninja can climb up walls without taking any losses from falling. They can also do it while invisible. What this means is you can often focus all of your army on one area of the castle, and send in a small group of Kisho ninja to climb up the steepest part opposite and get right into the keep. Then you capture the gatehouse, cutting off the enemy army, mop up any forces in the keep terrace (often archers or yari which are easily picked off), and rain grenades down from above or capture the keep.

They are also great for defending castles. Swap out your archers for them when the enemy starts climbing and they will rain down grenades and be more than a match in melee for any units that get to the top of the walls."
Willravel,DaystromInstitute,1388775434.0,"I probably would have done a few things differently, given the benefit of hindsight. 

While I liked the stuff with Jadzia Dax and her previous hosts and stories related to that (like her affinity for Klingon culture and her history with Ben Sisko), I would have liked to see some Jadzia only stuff. We were told that Jadzia was a fully-formed, strong individual necessarily before the joining with Dax, but most of the time what we see is a fairly boring character that happens to have an interesting symbiont. Jadzia was a quiet, highly capable biologist and physicist, and a skilled pilot. Aside from that, all we really see of Jadzia was her drive to be joined. It seems like the Dax personality kinda took over. Given that we had six entire seasons to see her character—a character with probably the most interesting character potential of the entire show—, we didn't get a lot of views of her as Jadzia. 

Part of the reason I've always felt disappointed by Jadzia's death, aside from it seeming shoe-horned in and being a death unworthy of such a great character, is because I never felt like Jadzia had a great deal of inner growth. We see her relationships with others blossom, which is great, like her becoming great friends with Kira, her flirting becoming a solid friendship with Bashir, Jadzia finding her own take on what was previously Curzon's relationship with Sisko, and, of course, her relationship with Worf, but describing Jadzia internally, who she was at her core, was largely unchanged from season 1 to the end of season 6. 

If I could violate the Temporal Accords and go back to rewrite some of DS9 for the purpose of giving Jadzia Dax a better death, I would. One thing I would not change is her falling in love with and marrying Worf. To this day, I think that remains the best romantic relationship in all of Star Trek. I feel bad for Worf losing a second mate at the hands of senseless murder, but he's Klingon, so. What I probably would do is give Jadzia a multi-episode arc involving revealing a previously hinted at character flaw and providing her a context for revolving the flaw. When Picard was assimilated by the Borg and was then rescued, during his healing process he began to realize that his stoic nature was actually a defense mechanism he'd developed when he was first assigned the Enterprise, and that it was actually a barrier between him and his crew. We started to see real character change, and the Picard character became far more interesting and relatable because we could see his personal growth. I'd want to do something like that for Jadzia, to allow her a catharsis before death. 

__________________________

So, to finally answer the question...

I probably would have moved back Jadzia's death to the midseason finale of season 6, around episode 13, and had a three episode arc involving an incident triggering Jadzia's character flaw to come to the surface. The Dominion strikes the Trill home world, and Jadzia's parents are killed. Worf accompanies Jadzia back home, and we get to meet Jadzia's sister. We find out that Jadzia had a great relationship with her mother, but her relationship with her father was poor at best. Jadzia's father was a deeply religious man, one who felt that reflection, meditation, and study of the ancient Trill texts were a more worthy pursuit than Jadzia's interests in the sciences. She simply couldn't abandon her love of science, though, which led to a deep schism in their relationship when Jadzia left for Starfleet Academy to study biology and physics. 

This led to three things: 1) Jadzia is outgoing and flirtatious because she grew up without the approval and affections of her father, leaving a need for approval and connection deep in her personality, 2) Jadzia has always felt guilty about being a scientist, even though she grew up to be a science officer on a space station, a highly coveted position suggesting a very high level of talent and skill, and 3) Jadzia was deeply concerned about becoming a parent herself. 

Each of these three issues is brought up with a different character, first her somewhat light, flirty nature is brought up with her sister, who is very much like Jadzia's mother, and her sister helps her to understand that Jadzia actually only ever needed her own approval and affections toward herself, to love and accept herself for who she truly was. The second issue is brought up with her father's religious leader (the equivalent of a pastor), who is very much like Jadzia's father, and it allows her to finally vent all of what she's held inside since she was a girl. The religious leader confesses that Jadzia's father was actually quite proud of her, and was himself conflicted about the seeming duality of his nature as spiritual man but also as a man interested in the sciences, and he was proud of Jadzia for finding the courage to pursue her love of science. Finally, her fears about parenting are discussed with Worf, who describes how Jadzia is like his memories of his biological mother. She too was a brash, strong, independent woman, and even though he only had a short time with her, her strength and love will always be the best part of Worf. 

Jadzia emerges from the episodes with strong catharsis, a renewed love of and devotion to Worf, and with a newfound maturity and centered self. 

On the journey back from Trill, the Definat is ambushed by the same fleet that had devastated Trill, and, when Worf is injured during a bridge explosion, Jadzia takes the helm and manages to destroy a half dozen Jem'Hadar attack fighters before the Defiant is finally disabled and boarded. As the crew is rounded up to be taken prisoner, Worf discretely activates the Defiant's transporters and beams a spread of photon torpedoes onto the remaining Jem'Hadar ship, destroying it. When the First raises his pistol and fires it at Worf, Jadzia jumps in the way, saving him. The crew manages to turn the tables on the Jem'Hadar and kill them. As Jadzia lays, dying, she expresses that Worf made her life complete and that she would be waiting for him in Sto'Vo'Kor, but that he shouldn't join her too soon. After Worf's roar, he sets course for Trill, desperate to save the Dax symbiont, so at least Jadzia's memories could live on. The episode ends with a stoic look, and some blood, on Worf's face as he pushes the Defiant's damaged engines to warp 9.98. 

_________________________

Edit: whoops, hit submit early. 

Killing off Jadzia like this gives her a hell of a sendoff and also provides a full half season more to introduce the next host of Dax, Ezri or otherwise. The next Dax, necessarily, should be very different from Jadzia. Making Ezri a Trill who wasn't trained for or ready to join was a very good choice, though she would come off as a bit grating because of her cartoony naiveté sometimes. Part of me thinks that making the new host a lovable rogue archetype, a la Han Solo, might have added some interesting flavor to the cast. I think it would have been a hell of a lot more interesting for the new host to be physiologically woman but genderqueer, meaning outside of the gender binary. The trill host-symbiont thing already made room for presenting gender and orientation issues within a safer science fiction context, but begin a little more overt would have fit with the diverse outpost feel of *DS9*.

statusrobot,AskWomen,1388775486.0,"From what I've seen, it really comes down to how important your religious beliefs are to you. A casual believer and a casual atheist can probably get along fine as long as they connect on the things that are really important to them. Someone who's passionately committed to a religion probably shouldn't be with someone who's a passionately committed atheist, though. In that case, they disagree on something that's fundamentally important to them.

I only want to be with someone who shares my religious beliefs because they're very, very important to me. I don't talk about my beliefs much and I wouldn't force them on anyone, but they matter a lot to me and I've sacrificed in order to live in accordance with them. To me, issues relating to deity and life after death and religious truths are fundamental, and it would just break my heart to form a lifetime bond with someone who significantly disagreed with me on them. I'd also have a really hard time believing that someone who thought religion was silly or unfounded really respected me or my beliefs (or possibly my intelligence, if they're the atheism=intellectualism type).

I can absolutely respect people whose beliefs differ from me, but there's enough distance in regular relationships to allow for that. Your friends are living their own lives separate from yours. You long term partner is more sharing a life with you, and I can't imagine trying to do that with someone whose core values and beliefs about the nature of that life conflicted with my own."

Maybe if you give him the opportunity for some of the improvements be ""his idea,"" he might surprise you in his willingness to help.

As far as compromise, he should be willing to help around the house, especially with raising two kids. But don't make a show of vacuuming while he's playing video games. That will just make him feel guilty and resentful. Sit him down and say something like, ""Hey, let's try to clean this place up this weekend. We don't want the kids getting into anything. Would you rather do the dishes or the laundry?""

And for meal planning, get a wall calendar and write down which meals are planned for which days, so he has no excuse for eating the same thing for lunch. Ask him for input when planning meals for the week. And plan to dine out once or twice a week, too. I think him refusing to eat ANY leftovers is odd and possibly a passive aggressive tactic, but if he continues to refuse, you can always freeze leftovers so you have something to heat up when you don't feel like cooking.

Just because someone ""can go to a doctor now"" doesn't mean they are going to when the ER is available.

We had plenty of clinics, but we were still inundated with Medicaid patients with minor complaints.

And some of these people expected to be seen *quickly* even if the ER was literally bursting with serious patients.

There were days when you'd have patients walk out because they had to wait.

The only way this problem will be solved is if ERs are allowed to say, after triage, ""You don't have a complaint that is an emergency.  Here's a list of our clinics.  You need to go to one of those.""

&gt;private clubs of young guys who would get together with guys from work or from their town and have matches

Around there that sounded more like rugby. Football is more organised and professional. Has been for a while. Its easier to stop trouble when you got more money and can provide stuff that stop fighting, like fences or security, which again applies more to football than to rugby.

No one goes to watch school rugby. You get like 50 people always dads. Maybe it was different 100+ years ago I dont know.

Schools in Britain are more likely to have a football team than a rugby team I would think. There is more rugby teams per school for private admittedly. This is only England I would think. Im a bit off on this, its doesnt apply to Wales. We mostly have shitty public schools but my school had a rugby team and no football team. Private schools cant play public schools. So my league was all lower class public schools and all of Wales is lower class really, we dont have problems with rugby fights.  "

Zagaroth,ffxiv,1388777059.0,"For all intents and purposes, ignore Ruin II as a damage spell. 

You have three dots with decent damage and duration. Your job is to keep those up, and Bane and fester as circumstances dictate. ANd shadowflare is a godsend. 

Your quick AOE order for 3+ mobs is Shadowflare, Miasma II, Blizzard 2

If the mobs are not super-fast diing, then you Shadowflare, three-dot &amp; Bane (make sure you *SEE* all three before you use bane), then you can use Miasma II and Blizzard 2.

Note: Blizzard 2 can be used with 2+ enemies, Miasma II isn't worth it unless you have at least three (very low damage)

Also, if you are going to Main SMN vs Maining SCH, you need to swap your points from mind to INT. 

SMN is a build dots &amp; burst sort of class. Also do not forget Rouse and Awaken (i think that's the second one) to increase Pet damage

I have 2 opening boss sequences that I can combine if I don't have to move at all, or do seperately if I am moving 

Raging Strikes -&gt; Bio II -&gt; Miasma -&gt; Bio (make sure it lands first) -&gt; Fester -&gt; shadow flare -&gt; (maybe time for pet sequence) -&gt; Second fester before Raging Strikes wears off.

Pet sequence is simply get ROuse and Awaken up, then blast the boss with Enkindle.

Rest of the fight is mostly about keeping dots and shadowflare up, blasting Fester when possible, and reactivating Rouse &amp; Awaken when they are up. Only use enkindle when both Rouse and Awaken are available to buff with first. If there are dots already up, you can using Raging Strikes and immediately fester, then start applying the more  powerful dots and have a large time buffer to get your second Fester in. "

He generally refused to speculate on how the universe was created, saying it was unimportant for the business of bringing an end to suffering.  Tibetan Buddhism does believe there are gods, or divine beings.  It just doesn't require their worship.  Rather it suggests they are other kinds of creatures which exist on a different level of existence.

benk4,atheism,1388777809.0,"&gt; The allegations made today are reprehensible and totally not compatible with what Mike Priefer stands for.

&gt; Contrary to Chris’ statements

Sounds like he's accusing Kluwe of lying.  Were you expecting him of going line to line and dismissing every statement made by Kluwe?  

He didn't expressly say that it didn't happen, but then again how could he?  Unless he was with Priefer every minute of every day he can't say he's never made bigoted comments.  What he did say is that comments like that are not compatible with what Priefer stands for, which heavily implies that he never heard Priefer say anything like that.  Considering he's a kicker and Priefer is the special teams coach I think he would know if that was a common occurrence as Kluwe said.  

So there's three possibilities:  A) Walsh is lying,  B) Kluwe is lying, C) Priefer never said bigoted things in Walsh's presence.  

As I said before C seems like quite a stretch from the start and is basically refuted by Kluwe himself.  So we're down to he said she said between two extremely biased sources.  Verdict: We have no idea what happened so I'm not going on a witch hunt.  "

I guess that's reasonable, but I don't agree.  Feeling spited by someone can be an extremely strong motivator.  Look at some of the shit people do to their exes.  I don't trust Kluwe's word at all.

Walsh also in his statement jumped to defend Leslie Frazier who is no longer his coach.  So he really has no motive to defend him.  But I do accept that maybe he's telling the truth in defending Frazier and lying about Priefer, or that he never experienced anything like Kluwe did with Frazier.  Both are legitimate possibilities.

Turn the whole thing around.

Who's the asshole in that situation? Is it the person that lied?

Th3Gr3atDan3,gallifrey,1388778624.0,"That is an incredibly good point, actually. Your comparison to Stargate made me realize something: shows with an episodic nature that are tied by a secondary season arc tend to lend themselves more towards a binge marathon watching, whereas shows that are heavily serialized lend themselves towards weekly viewing.

Unfortunately, the trend in television (due to the success of serialized shows such as Breaking Bad, Lost, etc) has been one of shorter season, with mid season breaks. Shows such as BSG and SG1 benefited greatly from 22+ episode seasons.

Why? Well, that is something I very much would like to discuss! :) My feeling (that I am just formulating now) is that episodic shows (due to their very indisputable nature) focus on the content of the specific episode, therefor not having the character as the focus. With the larger seasons, we are able to connect to the characters, develop a bond, an emotional connection. Doctor Who is most definitely of the episodic nature, yet series 7 only had 13 episodes, split by a mid season break, followed by 2 more episodes months apart."

GOOD. if someone tells you their favorite food is mashed potatoes you could follow up with something like ""oh what do you do to get the lumps out"" 

BAD: ""really, why? How often do you make it then? Isn't that too boring?""  

In other words, ask open ended questions that don't judge and move the conversation forward. Try to make them feel like the expert, so they feel confident when they talk, it will make them feel good (the fun thing is, most people are the expert on things they enjoy and you can learn loads from them).

JAWJAWBINX,todayilearned,1388779914.0,"I had to do something for a class so I've been up for awhile, despite it being a winter course school still takes priority to other things.

First off the common behaviors are understood at least well enough for them to be used diagnostically, in fact the understanding of these behaviors has increased over time so that individuals who do not display signs of them as openly (even those that have essentially mastered passing for NT) can be diagnosed by experts. The testing pathology is behaviorally based so there are some issues, namely other conditions that present similarly. As such there are IQ tests, as autism has been shown repeatedly to have no involvement with intellect and thus individuals with IQ deficits can either be ruled out as being autistic or have some comorbidity causing the deficit. Then you have genetic tests to rule out things like fragile X, many genetic conditions that can present similarly can be corrected and all have fundamental differences from autism. Then you have brain scans to rule out potential brain damage, as again it can present similarly.

As to autism itself, it is understood to be entirely genetic but it is not known how it is passed down (it is assumed that it is of similar complexity as skin color) and very few places are actively looking into that aspect due to the common view of autism. People are researching into the physiological differences between NTs and the autistic and they have made some interesting discovers. Namely the autistic brain is structured differently, primarily with areas of significantly higher connectivity and more distant connections (these distant connections are not in place of but in addition to immediate connections). Unfortunately this is unlikely to be used to aid in diagnosis as the scans are expensive and the current testing methodology is accurate enough.

Furthermore the supposed social deficits seem to stem from a gap between innate behavior. NTs are wired to process and respond to certain things in specific ways, the autistic brain is wired to work differently. In essence the autistic are wired to communicate non-verbally (and to some degree verbally) in a specific way that NTs are not, because it was uncommon for the autistic to interact outside of certain environments it was not readily apparent that there is an innate understanding of one another but that interaction is becoming more common. Interestingly enough it seems likely that while either group can learn to read and emulate the other fluency can only be obtained one way as the emotional language of the autistic relies heavily upon emotional contagion.

There has also been some advancement on the subject of functioning levels, namely that they don't really apply. A single individual will vary so much not only between different subjects but over the course of a single day, although much of this depends on what happens that day and the individual, that they cannot accurately be defined by such criteria. Furthermore the base state for the autistic is becoming better defined, suggesting that many of the individuals previously thought to be totally incapable of communicating or even understanding others are fully capable with the proper method and that the lower functioning have comorbid conditions that are causing much of their behavior. In many cases the comorbid condition is severe abuse at a young age, due to sensory differences some environments are as detrimental to an autistic individual as being raised in an active construction site would be to an NT child. Luckily many of those environmental factors are becoming less common or less problematic as technology improves, for example the common complaint of just a few years ago was about fluorescent lights (they would emit a piercing buzz and often would flicker) which have since become longer lasting and more efficient which has made them more sensory friendly.

Many of these discoveries have been the result of researchers either consulting with adult autistics or not making the assumption that autism is the result of some detriment. This has resulted in many previously held beliefs about autism being found to essentially be the opposite of the truth. For example many assumed that the autistic lacked sympathy (commonly referred to as empathy but there are attempts to simplify the terminology as the term is currently referring to two things but assumed to mean one) because they rarely act in the ways that NTs do which show it but by talking to the autistic and having them help explain other's behavior it's been found that the autistic often avoid such situations because they feel the other person's pain and have found that by doing what comes naturally to comfort others they usually make things worse, finding it better for everyone to just avoid the situation and hope things would work out."

LolaRuns,GameDeals,1388780289.0,"It's a very fun game with a pretty interesting take on turn based and (minimal) resource management. The art is nice and the story is pretty fun, the game is very polished. 

I recently finished the main campaign and I enjoyed it. 

That said, in the main campaign it's a bit on the easy side when you realize that you can win almost any engagement by camping till your opponents resources have run out =&gt; maybe the game would have benefitted from more bonus objectives (there are always 3 per level, sometimes they contradict each other and hence can't be done in the same playthrough of the map) that focused on finishing the map quickly. However, after the main campaign (which again is still fun) there's like a mini expansion which has slightly different gameplay where you actually have to preserve your units through several missions/your units don't reset and it's actually quite the spike in difficulty =&gt; very interesting. 

It also has versus multiplayer (not just two players, you can also do more than two), though I personally I considered this just a fun little distraction rather than something I felt people would sink a lot of time in. Oh and it works well with a controller. 

That said, I'd recommend [just watching a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5JCTyFozMY) to check whether the art style and type of humor appeals to you.

k3rnelpanic,rccars,1388780430.0,"If it's your first truck I'd say go with 2S. It's still plenty fast on 2S and will be good for bashing unless you're trying to do 60mph speed runs down the highway. The upside to a 2S is it will fit in the truck as you get it, a 3S will probably require the large battery hold down.

As far as batteries go, don't get too hung up on trying to get something with the best discharge curve, or ROAR approved, or whatever. Just get one that has some good reviews online and seems to have a good value. I've run lots of cheap Turnigy batteries out of China and they've been great for me. If you're new then you'll want to get something that has a traxxas connector on it already so you don't have to do any soldering. To start I'd recommend going with a 2S in the 5000mah range.

For a charger look for something that has AC power input, many are only DC input, and has an internal balancer for Lipo batteries. You'll want to make sure it supports 2S and 3S batteries but you won't need a really high capacity charger to start off with. For most lipo batteries it's recommended to charge at 1C. That means if it's a 5000mah battery, charge it at 5 amps, a 5200mah would be 5.2amps. Personally I've had good luck with Duratrax chargers but again check the reviews online.

You shouldn't need to worry too much about hop-up parts for the ultimate right out of the box since it comes with many aluminum parts. The one I would recommend is a new motor mount. The stock one has a really weak bearing in it and if it seizes it will usually melt your slipper and cause some issues. The one I run is from [King Headz RC](http://www.amainhobbies.com/product_info.php/cPath/1_25_1466_2663/products_id/248809/n/King-Headz-Traxxas-Slash-4x4-LCG-Rally-Aluminum-Motor-Mount-w-Bearing) and it is a nice bolt in part. Also I think the ultimate comes with both the center slipper and center diff, I'd leave the slipper in for bashing. It allows some slippage in the driveline and saves you from breaking parts. Especially if you are running on pavement a lot.

Hopefully that'll get you started. It's mostly just my opinion and what I've found based on a few years of racing the slashes."

Dax was, in a sense, both.

During Curzon's life, Dax was part of the life of a diplomat, so it recorded experiences and thoughts of a diplomat.

delqhic,ultrahardcore,1388781103.0,"I disagree. Like I said, there are more than enough games to compensate for a few games being pre-whitelist only. Whoever spends more time on the PC has absolutely nothing to do with it, if anything, non-pre-whitelisted games are affected by this more.

e.g. I see a To4 game tomorrow that I want to play in. I sign my team up in the comments, then go off my PC until 30 minutes before the game tomorrow. I can then just jump in the game when I come on with the knowledge I'll definitely be able to play.

For a game without pre-whitelisting, it means that you need to be on your PC, refreshing your server list, waiting to join as soon as the clock hits the 45 minute mark. Then, if it's a team game, at peak times there's usually a decent chance your full team won't be able to get in, Then if you can't get them whitelisted afterwards, you need to leave and find a different game, requiring you to be on your PC much more.

bananaruth,AskReddit,1388781677.0,"No, you misunderstood me. This thread is about first dates. Subsequent dates are not the topic. The rules regarding them are different. 

You brought up a completely irrelevant point out of gut reaction defense. ""She said something about men paying, I better correct her about about the burden that men have paying for everything all those greedy women like her want. She needs to know that."" You inferred a lot from a very small statement I made. Between that and the fact that what you said has already been stated several times in the comments here, you're massively pissing me off. 

If you're dating a woman who expects you to pay for everything they want, you should consider dumping them and looking for someone else. No one I know does that. Often times when you (as a woman) offer to pay, the guy refuses to let you pay. Especially on first dates, but it can be an enduring problem. All I was trying to say was that paying/insisting on paying does not mean you're owed sex. I could pay, so if you end up paying, it's because you're being nice. That's all."
JIVEprinting,martialarts,1388781677.0,"Not that it's particularly good, I just fell into a lucky position with a tight lapel grip. This was also literally the first point I've ever scored in practice so, pretty excited. I bridged to escape from... well it was all pretty hectic, but I habitually go for lapel and collar grips whenever I'm working for a position on the ground. After a turnover, or something, I spun over top and had a decent position for an arm bar with him on his back, but had the grip on his bottom lapel still. It was the second time I was surprised to get a grip I liked, and deep. Well I finished turning into position and set my leg over his head a la the arm bar, but grabbed onto the lapel instead with my grip levered on my leg. I couldn't lean back the same way but had the choke solid, and pushing my leg away only pressed the choke tighter. I settled into place and realized the position was good (though I was laying away above his shoulder rather than straight), but he didn't seem to react. So I took a breath, gripped hard, and pulled hard. Still no reaction so I tightened up and pulled with everything I had. I knew it was good but he wasn't budging so all I could do was attack full power, then finally after what seemed like 10 seconds (guessing 3 actual) he tapped. On reflection I don't think I had body control and he was definitely tired, but he told me he at first thought he'd rather defend the choke than the arm bar. I didn't realize at the time. It was also a brown substituting for the normal instructor."

Zombie Apocalypse meets Groundhog Day: you live in an open world sandnox city where patient zero emerges. The first ""day,"" you wake up and do your daily routine. Subtle changes occur. A regular doesn't show up at a coffee house. In the late afternoon, you see lots of cars lining up at the gas station. Traffic is unusually dense leading away from the city. You get phone calls from friends and relatives. Finally, the zombies emerge. they storm everywhere. you can't save yourself or your family. You die protecting them.

And then you wake up. Was it a dream?

I'll continue in a second. I'm on my phone, I'll be able to write a better summary when I'm at my computer.

Okay, so I wrote up a hell of a lot of material, and I realize I want to save it and keep it close. The idea is to repeat the same day to solve the ultimate mystery: who is patient zero? Finally, you find him and kill him. Is it the end, though? There would be real-time AI for citizens and officers, you would build a vast amount of information (phone numbers, peoples' itineraries, an epidemiological graph of infected and infections), and your actions change what happens during the day. You either die, or you fall asleep, but either way you wake up in your bedroom, to your alarm clock, and then have to continue investigating until the remainder of the day. Amazingly, your tablet/smartphone will continue keeping track of all your information, even though the entire day restarts."

IUI is actually less crazy than IVF. Think fancy turkey baster -- no surgery needed. If you're doing a fertility cycle to ripen eggs *and* IUI, you need to deal with injections and some crazy hormones in addition to the expensive of the cycles. If you're doing IVF, no matter the reason, you have to do the injections, then harvest the eggs, then make the embryos and culture them, then find healthy ones, then implant one or two. It costs so, so much and most insurance doesn't cover it or covers a small portion only (like $2000 when the total cost is &gt;$50,000)."

That seems odd but new babies can be really hard on their siblings and especially once your belly gets in the way they are possessive of their mama time.  Hell my five year old is still jealous of sharing my lap with my belly!

A practice baby can be really helpful because it lets big brother be involved with the baby, teach him to hold it properly, have it around the house with you, swaddled, just hanging out, becoming a fixture that doesn't interfere with what you and your little man are up to.  

Otherwise you mostly just need patience, let him help with all the things, even though it all takes longer.  Crazy as it makes you now, they do the unthinkable and *grow out of it!*  It's dreadful once they grow out of it.

Now, if you look like you haven't hit puberty yet, then yes, that would probably be a problem, as a lot of men aren't attracted to that (and the ones who are and hit on you without knowing your real age are probably not people you would want to date).

You say 15-18... I don't know what you look like exactly, but I'm going to assume that age-range means post puberty, with clearly defined sexual features and so on. You are short and have a youthful face, and that's pretty much it.

Just be aware any partner you have, especially male partners, might be in trouble if people mistake you for younger than you are, even if they're actually younger than you (say, 20 or something). But that's not anything that can't be clarified through having your ID on you among other things.

Are you in college? If so, the people you meet there will definitely know how old you actually are. And people look differently when you know them. I'm not sure how to explain that but... have you ever found someone more beautiful after you became friends, or uglier when you realised they were a shitty person?

Same kind of thing. People who know you, because you're a mature person, will perceive you as older. So unless you have a little girl's voice it shouldn't get in the way of having a relationship with them."

Like in my head, there's a cup of frozen jizz and that's *all.* Once it's gone, it's gone, and a cup is probably noooot the amount they freeze. So surely there's only so many attempts that can be made, each attempt costing a crapload of money.

Money that, to me, could be a car or an education for our kids or a better house - I mean in OP's case, the money is not paying for a baby. It's paying for NOT babies to happen. He's considering spending the money on birth *control*, not having kids. It's not that he needs the money to have kids, he wants it to avoid them til he's ready. So, for those (not you) being like, BUT HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR A BABY HOW CAN YOU SAY IT'S WORTH A CAR - no one's paying for a baby here. They're paying for a slight increase in *not* babies. The increase is really, very slight. Two forms of birth control used properly is not much more effective than a vasectomy, so dropping tens of thousands on birth control *for fuck all results* is just.. insane to me."

scottious,AskReddit,1388783275.0,"1)  Don't get hung up on one guy/girl.  Easier said than done, but put yourself out there, don't be afraid of rejection, and if they aren't reciprocating in a reasonable amount of time, move on.  Rejection isn't the worst thing in the world.

2)  The world owes you nothing.  People (well, employers specifically) only really care what you can do for them, so get good at something that people want.

3)  Choose your college major wisely.  Being a poet, historian, artists, etc might work out for you... but a safer bet is something where the jobs are abundant.  If you choose not to go to college, that's fine too... just pursue a career in a trade or something and pursue it with passion.

4)  Learn to be comfortable with being bad at something.  In order to go from novice to expert you first have to be everything in between.

5) LEARN DISCIPLINE AND SELF CONTROL.  I can't tell you how many people I know who are ruled by the desires they have in the moment.  They can't for the life of them get themselves to the gym or practice a craft that takes years to get good at.  All they see is what they want NOW and that's all that matters to them.

6) Do your frickin homework and study.  College isn't a party, your job for 4 years is to learn so do a damn good job and learn as much as possible.

7) At the same time, have some fun, but practice moderation.  Drinking is okay every once in a while in moderation.  Weed is okay too, in moderation.  Moderation is key.  So many people get into habits of smoking or drinking every day at the expense of other more important things.  If you don't think you have that kind of self-control, then don't even start."

FYI, average length is only 5 1/2 inches, and many women prefer comfort over size by quite a bit. So under average is a plus for smaller women. (I mean those with tighter and shorter vaginas)

And that's the one point. You're sure enough you don't want children to get a vasectomy. Now, taking the initiative for birth control is awesome and great and you get bonus points for that. But thinking about vasectomy because you don't want children, and at the same time about insemination?

Are you so worried about changing your mind? Or are you considering having children if you meet someone who want them even though you don't want them? It just seems that if you might want bio children someday with enough certainty to freeze your sperm just in case, well then why the vasectomy?

It's a big decision and it's good you're thinking about it, and I guess you want to keep your options open, but it does seem a little bit contradictory.

Now, there are people who don't want biological kid, and get sterilised at the same time they try adopting. That, I guess, it's not inconsistent at all. But vasectomy+keep my semen for later is, well, weird to me."

Magic? You can play with magic any way you like. The issue is *technology.* It was maybe 20 years between first getting access to saltpetre arms that Europe had totally integrated cannons into warfare. Clothes, food, crops, animals... anything useful or representative of a successful society will spread like wildfire even over ordinary barriers. You need *isolation* to keep steampunk out of a medieval society, for example.

&gt; to have differences in magic arise from different cultural traditions

If your magic is sufficiently useful, then societies will integrate it because it's useful. If it's sufficiently powerful, then societies will be conquered by it. You *need* artificial barriers to it because in real life it would diffuse rather quickly.

Don't be afraid of phlebotinum. The only reason your world isn't just the real world is phlebotinum. Tropes Are Not Bad.

I had work at 9am, so I had to get to bed. 

I've heard talk of extending the sale, so is there any chance that Support (are they down now too?) would give me some kind of raincheck or coupon? Or would it just be a waste of time on my part?"

iammas13,steelers,1388784068.0,"Well, for the first pick of the draft, I say get the best talent available (excluding obvious positions, like QB, RB, OLB, and WR unless Sammy Watkins or Mike Evans is there somehow)  then 2nd round, get a TE, (or cb if we haven gotten one and there's a good one available) 3-7 should all be project positions, preferably WR, MLB, OL, and maybe more depth positions.

Personally, I don't think coaching should change at all, except for (obviously) o-line coach and possibly strength and conditioning.

In free agency, only thing we should get is depth and, depending on cap space, a great LT. The two big FA tackles are Veldheer and Branden Albert. The raiders have a ridiculous amount of cap space so Veldheer doesn't seem like a possibility, and the Chiefs may not want to keep Albert, so he might be the guy the steelers could go after. With a good LT, our offense would be fantastic, and depending on how well Gilbert progresses, we could have a dominant offensive line."

POGtastic,TumblrInAction,1388784333.0,"(Marine here)

3 pull-ups is the minimum. The male PFT consists of three parts: pull-ups, sit-ups, and a three-mile run. The minimum standards are a joke - 3 pull-ups, 44 sit-ups in two minutes, and a 28:00 three-mile.

The maximum, on the other hand, is 20 pull-ups, 100 sit-ups, and an 18:00 three-mile. Looking at the average in my shop, most guys get about 15 pull-ups, do 100 sit-ups, and run the three-mile in about 23:00.

Women have a joke for their standards, however. For a very long time, they haven't had to do pull-ups; they do what's called a Flexed-Arm Hang, where you are supported with your chin above the bar and have to hold yourself up for as long as you can. Then they reduced the standard even farther and said that time stops when your elbows completely lock out. 70 seconds is a perfect score.

Now that they're trying to put women into combat roles, the Commandant has declared that women will do pull-ups, albeit with a reduced number for the maximum (8 instead of 20). Except... half of them can't even do 3.

The thing that gets me is that this has been in the works for a long, long time. It was talked about in March; people have had a while to prepare. And they still can't do it."

DreadfulRauw,AskMen,1388784389.0,"&gt; But a relationship? A relationship has no ends to achieve. That whole argument that you're trying to make is based on the fact that a relationship is trying to achieve some sort of ends, which would mean the relationship would come to an end once it fulfills that purpose. But you don't get into a relationship to achieve some sort of ends. Therefore, the first part doesn't apply, so only the second part does.

And I'm going to disagree here.  Of course relationships have ends.  Why get into a relationship if not to achieve something, be it happiness, sex, companionship, children, financial stability, etc. ?  Why do you get into relationships?

&gt;The problem here is that people see ""failure"" as a terrible thing, and are looking to make it sound better. You can twist the way a relationship ended and say that it wasn't a failure, because at least you learned something, but that would still be twisting things just to make them in your favor. You can still fail while learning something and that's okay, so I see no reason to have to do that. I don't see why everyone gets so upset at the word ""failure.""

But how can it be a failure if I went in looking tor something, and found it?  That's success."

The logo placement is much better. Overall I like where they are. Using the Reddit name over the Snoos on the top part of the side pods was a good move. Mixing Reddit gold in there is also a nice touch. How you make/find these logos so fast IDK, but good work either way.

The Up/down arrows on the nose might need to be switched with the Renault logo. Due to the mapping this puts the Renault logo on the front edge of the front wing, which looks out of place.

If It was me, I'd put the reddit name back on the ""front"" part of the rear wing and move the RES to the back part of it. This is more to enforce the idea that Reddit is the title sponsor. It's a bit nit-picky, but I'd also see about moving the reddit type on the sidepods up a bit. They are hard to read since they are on the undercut part of the pod.

If you have the space, I would recommend getting a mesh sweater dryer, [like this](http://www.amazon.ca/Household-Essentials-Stackable-Sweater-Drying/dp/B001BRW6TE) instead of drying it on a towel, as this will allow air flow on both sides of your sweater, instead of a towel on top of a counter which is holding one side of your sweater against a damp surface. 

I have heard of other people using a salad spinner for getting water out of knits, so then you would only have to burrito once. Obviously this sweater is not going to fit comfortably into a standard salad spinner but getting one [specifically for laundry](http://www.amazon.com/The-Laundry-POD-LP001WHT-White/dp/B005FD7Z82/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388784075&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=spin+dryer+laundry+alternative) or for [commercial use](http://www.amazon.com/Liter-Gallon-Large-Commercial-Spinner/dp/B001PHM8A2/ref=sr_1_8?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388784436&amp;sr=1-8&amp;keywords=salad+spinner) is pretty pricey, so it's probably more economical to just use all the towels.

Thetruthtruths,AskMen,1388784731.0,"See this is interesting because not all guys think this way or are put off by the fact a woman is accomplished. But you have to understand, as stated in another post, a mans attractiveness is usually measured by accomplishments not physical attributes. So deeming those accomplishments not needed or redundant put some guys off.But if you want that guy and make him feel special that he is with you for a reason instead of just a label, then that's what makes it work. The thing a lot of guys don't like though is the attitude by some women that after being independent and self reliant for some time, some women think they can just settle down and pick any guy up like we're a fucking commodity. When it doesn't work or backfire, they pick up the attitude ""well they must be intimidated by me"" which is bullshit.

If you're running the NiMH you'll notice the truck is really fast for the first couple of minutes and then slows down a bit, then it gradually slows down until the battery is dead. With Lipo you'll have a nice flat discharge curve where the truck is fast through 90% of the runtime and doesn't slow down noticeably until the end.

NiMH batteries will also get hot when you're running them and shouldn't be charged when they are hot. Lipos seem to put up with running them and re-charging right away better than NiMH.

Also the 7 cell that ships with these trucks is a 3300mah so you'll get less runtime than you would if you used a 5000mah Lipo but that's kind of obvious. You should actually get a little more speed out of a 8.4v NiMH than a 7.2v 2S lipo but it's not worth the trade offs."

Quite frankly, arguing with you has offered me very little challenge, and the only reason I have continued to do so is simply because the extremities that your obvious mental dysfunctions take you to have repeatedly proven to be highly entertaining.

She retorted again that I was mistaken and began to take me down the aisle where the external drives were at...as we passed by the internal drives, including the one on sale. She showed me the external ones for a minute, then I told her to follow me. I took her back down the aisle, showed her the internal drives, pulled the one off the shelf that was on sale, and told her thank you and walked off. Her face was completely blank. That was one of two times I let someone help me.

The other time I was looking for an Apple router and their website showed they had about a dozen in stock at that store. I couldn't find them in the router section, so I asked a Geek Squad counter tech to help as the counter was right there.

I've been a science fiction fan most of my life, and I enjoy that sort of speculation.

The problem is that many jobs don't require physical fitness at all. Sure, you need to be a cock-diesel warbeast if you're in Infantry, Artillery, and other ground-pounding roles, but you don't need to if you're in Admin, Supply, Food Services, Freight, Data, or any of the other support roles.

Because women were limited to non-combat roles, they based the standards instead on ""strength of character,"" meaning ""Does this person have the drive to improve her body?"" Going by that metric, a woman who works just as hard as a man will do worse but be no less driven. In theory, a woman who gets a 285 on her PFT is just as driven as a man who gets a 285 on his PFT.

In practice, it doesn't work that way... and it's gotten to the point where women are given preferential promotions because their physical fitness tests are easier. If they were held to men's standards, women wouldn't be getting promoted. Hell, half of them would be getting kicked out.

The real losers here, sadly, are the women. They get promoted and then get stuck over people who don't respect them. If they'd been held to a higher standard and treated fairly and without favoritism, they'd get more respect."

irrational_abbztract,BF4_X1,1388785463.0,"Hey!

Abz here.

I apologize for the issues that have plagued the subreddit in terms of the flair.

I understand that I have been very closed about the issues to I'll use this comment to open up about it. Maybe there's someone here who may be able to help.

---

The flair system was initially worked perfectly as intended on this subreddit. People could set flairs and this is how many still do.

At some point in time, the flair system stopped working. After being made aware of this only recently, I checked and realized that even though the everything was been enabled, something was causing the flair system to be uneditable by users. The only way to add, delete or modify flairs would be for the mods to do so manually. One flair at a time. For 600 members.

---

I will, after having tried playing with the settings and the CSS, remove all CSS work that has already been done and start from scratch.

---

I want suggestions on how the sub should look when all the work is done. I want ideas. Concepts (implementable ones). Mockups. Whatever. Give us something to look at so we know what we're making.

The current mod team is only made up of the bricklayers. We need to know what we're building before we lay down the bricks.

---

If there is anyone here who has enough CSS knowledge to assist in this project and would like to assist in this project, feel free to send the mods a message saying so and we'll get something going.

I also would like to recruits some experienced mods from multiple timezones to assist with the subreddit. Same for CSS guys. Having people from multiple timezones will allow things to be resolved more quickly.

---

So to sum it up, there are issues and we are attempting to resolve them. Flairs aren't currently applicable but we are working on it. Its Saturday here now and I shall do my best to get this fixed by Monday morning.

If you have any suggestions you'd like to make, please do so via mod mail. This ensures that it is seen by all mods.

Thank you.

Abz."

In combat training, our platoon had about forty women. During marches, about thirty-five of them fell out.

Alright, well I literally disagree with all the arguments I just made. Peter Singer's [Famine, Affluence, and Morality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine,_Affluence,_and_Morality) makes a very powerful argument where he convincingly counters every single argument I just made. In fact there is a ton of literature in ethical philosophy on this issue, such as this one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_High_and_Letting_Die by Unger. The gist is basically: humans are inconsistent in how they apply ethics. The only real way to resolve it, as an affluent Westerners, is to give as much money as we can. Even if you can't assure anything, if the likelihood that your money will go towards saving lives is even remotely plausible and the inconvenience to you is so slight, you are morally obligated to help."

leavenworth,SubredditDrama,1388786247.0,"I was specifically responding to a comment by Shaman_bond that saying ""I wouldn't want to date a dude"" when talking about a transwoman would not be cruel. I think it would be, if you are aware of how she identifies. I'm not sure why you thought I was saying anything else.

&gt;For me -- and a lot of straight men if these threads are anything to go by -- the point is that we see a person with a penis as a man regardless of their ""identity."" I will likely call her ""she"" 'cos it's no skin off my nose and I'm not a total dick, but would never consider a sexual relationship.

This indicates that to consider someone ""female"" you need to consider a sexual relationship with them, though. When someone asks you to consider her female, unless she's asking that you do so in a sexual way, she's not asking you to see her as a sexual object, but as a female. You probably pass a hundred women in the street in a week that you wouldn't have sex with but also consider female - women too old, girls too young, women who aren't your type physically, women you're related to, etc. Asking someone to say ""I wouldn't date a transwoman"" instead of ""I wouldn't date a dude"" is simply identifying what you wouldn't want to date about that specific person. 

&gt;For much of society, identifying as a woman whilst in a male body is no different than someone identifying as a cat whilst in a human body.

I don't really know if you can state that unequivocally. You might think that, but I'd say that for society it is unusual to run across a transperson, but not, like, weird. It is NOT like running into someone who believes they are a cat, and as I said above, comparing them is strawman-esque. People are still people. I find it very difficult to think that the difference between me and my brother, or me and my boyfriend, or me and my father, is equal to the difference between me and another species. "

Avistew,sex,1388786425.0,"I've done it, even been the one to offer. Or for instance say I'm too tired for sex so he starts jerking off, then he warns me he's about to come (out of habit I guess) and I just move so he comes in my mouth. I've done that a couple of times I guess, because I felt like it (and because I knew it was okay with him, of course).

Now, doing it regularly is fine. Doing it for a week in a row however, I don't think I would like it as much, especially if it's planned ahead that I'm supposed to. I prefer it spontaneous. I'd rather do it once a week on average over a year than a whole week straight once a year.

Why? Well, because doing it every so often would make me feel good. Doing it a lot over a short period, even if afterwards I wasn't going to do it for a long time, would make me feel bad (taken advantage of, loved only for sex, etc, etc).

I don't think I can quite explain it. Too often would just turn me off. Feeling like it's expected of me would turn me off. Being told ""hey, would you mind doing it every so often?"" and then being the one who offers would turn me on. Being asked to do it rarely and spontaneously would be fine, neither a turn-on nor a turn-off.

So, with that in mind, I wouldn't want to experiment with it for a week, because as I said, if it's planned for I just won't feel like doing it, I'd feel expected to and taken advantage of if I said yes."

I find it kind of funny that this whole conversation started because you suggested doing the same thing (starting a petition to have a student removed). Legally speaking, there's no grounds for that *either*. And I seriously doubt that kid had a say in their parents' ill-informed vaccination decisions, so it's not like they're particularly at fault for the very reason you'd have them removed from the school. Whereas Dean makes a day-to-day choice to be a thorn in his community's side by providing perceived justification for rapists (""Hey, *that* guy says he's religious and believes women DESERVE to be raped - I'm *not* alone!"") whether he realizes it or not, shame and fury and hurt for women who have endured the humiliation of rape by victim-blaming, and general harassment for anyone with a fully functioning conscience. He's specifically to blame for his shitty actions; the kid who hasn't been vaccinated may still be too young to make their own legal decisions. It boggles my mind how you think it's justifiable to remove one but not the other, especially considering the circumstances. 

""Lol why do I think they haven't?"" Because I've seen countless pictures of that guy without counter-protesters around him. I've seen *one* story about *one* counter-protest, and I've looked. I feel like if there'd *actually* been the ""hundreds upon hundreds of people"" that you claim have done so, there'd be more than just the one story of people doing it once. If someone's actually done what I proposed, stood out there day after day next to time with a sign saying he's wrong, to ask them why, and proffering actual answers as to how to those interested, I would honestly love to hear about it because it would be encouraging to know someone's doing more than just showing up once with a crowd to say he's wrong.

These are usually on longer developing plays so their receiver can take advantage of the defense moving out of position. Then the quarterback snaps back to the receiver and the safety can't recover by the time the ball is thrown.

LizzieDane,AskWomen,1388787174.0,"Many men liked it, I might add - it's just less ""acceptable"" to read erotic fiction in public as a man. Not that I think it's okay for women to walk around with porn, either.

It may shock you, but lots of women *are misogynists.* Women slut-shame. Women hold rigid views on gender roles. Women are fully capable of, and frighteningly often engage in, sexism against women. It can be how they were raised, or just a byproduct of living in a misogynist society. They're not actively being like ""Woo! Oppression! Love it!"" - they just don't know any better. It's how things are *meant to be* for people that hold those views. 

Women who liked the book thought it was romantic and sexy. They didn't consider it abusive to deny someone agency and stalk them, and they probably didn't consider it stalking when he tracks Ana down over and over again.

The author didn't set out to write a book about abuse. It was meant to be erotic. The author found it erotic. The problem is that her idea of erotic is being raped, not given the chance to pull out of a relationship, having your pregnant belly flogged, and finally giving up when you realise you cannot love the kink out of someone. The problem is that she was *going* for ravishment, being needed, uh.. no, I can't even come up with something for the flogging bit, I just assume she has no idea what a flogger's like.

People liked it because they read it as the author intended: viewing these behaviours as desirable, signs of great love and need, erotic, sexy stuff."

I want more jobs, it is like my Abortion argument, we need to be proactive instead of reactive. We should create more jobs instead of creating a environment where jobs are being lost then deal with people losing money and jobs. t, I believe that the welfare rate is not moochers, but it is a indicator that more jobs should be made and welfare requirements then can be changed not now when people need it the most. I think that there should be a a lowering of the tax rate on businesses that employ more. So the more you employ the lower the tax rates on that business. Additionally, states should get grants in aid towards fixing failing cities, and by rejuvenating these cities we can get businesses to move to those cities as well. 

I dont like Obama cares penalties towards people who don't get health insurance. Young People are less likely to get insurance since they are less likely to get a serious illness, and yeah I do hate the insurance companies in this country. I am a northern republican so I am different then the southern hill billies that hate the poor. The poor should have more access to health care and canadas system is light speed ahead of ours. I know a single payer system is almost impossible in this country, so Obamacare is a good alternative but some things should be adjusted in it. I am a Republican because I do believe this party has gone away from its policies from the past, and we should get rid of the tea party and get smart people back into our party. We shouldn't be at war with the poor, we should be at war with poverty and trying to move people up. I am a centrist, I believed Clinton was a great President fiscally since he was not too liberal. I believe the Republican party can be redeemed only if we get rid of the garbage tea party, its like a sports team, I have always rooted for the Red Sox and i didn't falter on them when the garbage management came in that led to a meltdown 3 years ago, and 100 losses 2 years ago, I won't turn into a democrat because the republican party is stupid now, I only hope and I vote for republicans who are not tea baggers.

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1388787486.0,"A good read. This era of automation I think differs from the past as we're inching toward a point where a tiny fraction of the population can produce even working part time all of the essentials (food, water, clothing, shelter, energy). It's been shrinking for a couple of centuries and we've been diversifying into support and entertainment. Support is being automated and entertainment of a single group can reach nearly the entire globe.

I think we've got to dial back the expectations of people having working lives gradually. The reduction to 40 hr work weeks as a fairly typical thing was one step in that direction, though gender equality in the workplace has increased the supply of person hours to be satisfied. If we do not start building a society based on fewer hours worked by each individual I think we're in for a bloody time. It's fundamentally our choice though and could go the other way."

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1388787548.0,"I have a process, that I can give lots of examples of, and I'm pretty pleased with it.

1. Start with a traditional race, as fits into your story. Need haughty? Get elves. Need underdogs? Go with something small.
2. Add some unusual details. Some things I've used: snake bodies, spines instead of hair, brachiates, purple, photosynthetic, hunchbacked, only one eye, goes through metamorphosis in a cocoon... stack a bunch of these together until you get some monsters you've never seen before. I also like taking from pictures (/r/imaginarymonsters, look for concept art on deviantart) or from videogames I've played, and then adding and subtracting and putting twists on those creatures.
3. Paste them into your setting. Give them a place to live, with certain geographical and political features. They live near dragons or giant predatory birds? They'll get good at hiding or killing. Want them to be horsemen? Put them on a plain with horses. Good farmland? Expect them to farm.
4. Unflanderize them - run through their history. The super typical races are fucking boring because they've got no life beyond their tropes. Now you've made a cool monster and put it in a landscape with other races and flora and fauna. You only need to go as deep as you feel like going, but try to give them some development and direction in history. Figure out what they value and what they fear.
5. Revise. The other races around them will need to undergo this process *taking into account* the history of the first one. Once you've done everybody once you'll start doing the whole world together, taking into account far-flung technologies and events. This really gives your world a feeling a history and connectedness and maturity.

I don't fuck around with languages - I just make words up according to certain preconceptions in my head. I also *barely* draw maps. I scribble continents on paper and draw in features to justify the climate I want it to have for the sake of the race and story. Those can be easily integrated into this process, however. Language will have certain concerns and developments related to the setting and culture of this race, and should be part of that. Geography should be set before, and you'll include concerns for it in every part of your process."

The main issue, in my opinion, is that an infantry course for women would be effectively on par with special forces for men. It would have a 90% attrition rate and cost millions of dollars... with the product being average to mediocre infantrymen. We're certainly not short on male recruits, so why do we need women?

If you're recruiting from two pools of people, one of which costs $500 to train and the other costs $50,000 to train, it would be pretty silly to recruit from the latter."

DreadfulRauw,AskMen,1388787907.0,"&gt; Sure, it has a purpose, but I wouldn't equate ""ends"" with ""purpose."" They're similar, but I'm not sure I'd say they were interchangeable. This is because the relationship is supposed to continuously produce whatever you're looking to get out of it, instead of some final consequence. If it's happiness, the relationship should continue to give you happiness. If it's sex, it should continue to give you sex. By your own definition, once the relationship stops giving you these things, then how has it not failed?

So there's no such thing as a success that isn't permanent?  That's foolish.  Relationships change, and you can't say they've failed if they do.  Sometimes you get more than you planned on.  

&gt;You can have successes and failures at the same time. The guy who supposedly invented potato chips failed at getting back at the customer that was pissing him off, but was successful in creating a snack that became pretty damn popular. You can have a relationship fail while finding what makes you truly happy - that's allowed.

So you're saying potato chip guy should come to terms with the fact he's a failure?  What's the point there?  And how does that back the assertion that every relationship that ends is a failure?"

ballookey,exjw,1388788192.0,"Another take on my earlier question, if medical genetic therapies could cure or treat a serious illness you suffer from, would you accept the treatment? Such therapies are in the works for leukemia, multiple myeloma, parkinson's, amongst many more.

If science doesn't work, if science doesn't understand DNA, genetics, and doesn't produce valid results, then you should reject such potential cures as quackery.

But when such cures come, will you stand by your faith that science must be wrong? What if it's your wife, mother, brother, or child that could be cured?

And I speak of future gene therapy because it deals with scientists understanding genetics which is tangentially related to their study of evolution and the genetic evidence for it, but the same is true for any effective medical treatment existing. Why take Tylenol? Why take insulin?

Beyond medicine, technology at large touches and improves our lives everywhere: I hold in my hand a slab of black glass that can tell me the time anywhere on the planet, the weather, communicate with my family across thousands of miles, take photographs and videos, transmit them, play games and music, create music. I can draw on it, I can create music on it. I can read a library of books on it. 

If science is untrustworthy, then none of these things should work. How is it possible they do?

People make mistakes, but with science, the mistakes are discovered. Something doesn't work, retry the test. Reexamine the premise. Understand the failure. Try again. Investigation, study, disagreement are encouraged because that is how you discover the truth.

You scoff at evolution, but evolution is as sound as the science behind thousands of scientific marvels you take for granted every day. If you refuse to examine it objectively, outside the thought-control of the Watchtower Society, then you're *choosing* ignorance.

Hey, which is fine. Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for *though not beheld*. Faith doesn't need evidence — it says so right there in the Big Book of Faith. So if science is so foolish, don't trust it and have faith instead.

The Watchtower tries to have it both ways: Non-JW Creationists are laughable because they reject science, but science is scorned because it rejects biblical creation.

Well, the proof of the validity of one of these two, Science or Faith, is all around us. I type this out on the product of science."

daisyismydog,Indiemakeupandmore,1388788255.0,"I completely agree with this. I've been thinking about this for a while actually, prompted by what seems to be an increase in blog links being submitted so my opinion might be a bit lengthier. 

No matter how great the content is on a blog, I'm just not a fan of it being posted to a community (albeit one as small as this) without any way of accessing the content except for in a way that directly benefits the submitter. Additionally, in regards to the post feed bit, I've seen at least one blogger submit numerous links within one day and it felt completely like a post feed. Bloggers already advertise their websites in their flair with every comment they make and I feel like submitting an actual post more than 1x a week unless it's an update to a previous post or a situation is just ridiculous. 

I think it would be a bit of a pain in the butt for a rule with time restrictions to be enforced so I agree that the easiest way would be to switch over to /r/makeupaddiction's guidelines regarding this. I understand that it may be somewhat annoying for a blogger to reupload images onto to imgur for the purpose of reddit, but on MUA submitters generally just include the highlights. That is, if they swatched 9 different bronzers, they might include a picture of all the bronzers and then a picture with swatches of all of them rather than pictures of each individual swatch to show the detail.

Additionally, I find that I like reading off imgur because it has a certain format. Pictures are the focus rather than this long only somewhat relevant story about how the blogger decided to order what shades. If I do have an interest in any of the products I can always check out the blog link (URL generally provided at end of the imgur album from what I've seen on MUA). 

While on we're on the subject of bloggers, I really wish that any posts submitted to /r/indiemakeupandmore also be x-posted on the brand experience forum. I know that indieknow already does this to some extent which I appreciate. Other times when a blogger just submits a direct link to the community and doesn't x-post, I find it difficult to believe that their first goal is to contribute to the community. Plus, in general, it would also just be nice to have one single archive of all the reviews/opinions/thoughts which I think is the purpose of that forum instead of having to search through reddit to find threads/blog reviews and the brand experiences forum.

&gt;And it isn't the 30-40 dollars minimum for a first date that's the problem. It's doing that for every single one. 

combined with your previous complaint about women wanting you to pay for everything for them, surely you can see how it sounds like you are complaining about paying for every date - not just every first date.

&gt; Idiot.

A little hash don't you think. You don't really know anything about me. Calling me an idiot is an out of hand statement to invalidate everything I've said. I may not have gotten any sleep last night, but I know I'm not speaking gibberish. 

The very first thing you wrote was a complaint about women who expect you to pay for everything. That's not what either OP's post was about nor was it about my comment.You just wanted to make everything about you. You want sympathy. Sorry, I don't have any when your complaint is about paying for dates that you invited people to. It'd be like complaining if guests at a dinner party didn't pay you for the cost of the food.

Lastly, no. No. No. I never said you have to pay for every first date. *If* you ask someone out, you should pay based on social norms. I've asked people out before and I expect to pay for them. If you don't want to pay $40 per date, don't go on dates that cost $40. It's really that simple. Go to the park and buy ice cream. Go to a stargazing event. Make a small picnic. Go out for coffee. There are tons of ways to have a cheap, yet nice date. It's your choice where you take someone, just like it is your choice to ask them out."

jstarlee,nba,1388788309.0,I don't think any of the big three will take max contract.

All big three care more about rings than they do money. I think the same situation will happen again.

kungtotte,gaming,1388788364.0,"There are two reasons.

1. The path between all of the nodes is what defines the skill tree. If you want to get from node X to node Z, you have to pass through node Y. That means you can't pick every single important keystone node because you would spend too many skill points getting to them. This creates different build options, and adds a meta-game where you have to optimise your passive tree build.

2. Arranging the nodes into circles (or wheels) with rounded paths between them is really the most efficient way to display this information without forcing the user to scroll for days.

Dabookitty,atheism,1388788685.0,"[Buddhism is a Nonthesitic Relgion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism)

Is Buddhism Atheistic? 
As seen in the Basic Points of Buddhism, one general doctrine agreed upon by Buddhists is: ""We do not believe that this world is created and ruled by a God."" However, disbelief in a creator God does not mean that Buddhism is atheistic. 

I would think this would lean towards this is why it does not get a lot of attention from atheists.  As well most buddhists we probably encounter are the passivist type and don't try to impost thier beliefs on anyone and generally just keep to themselves.  They do have extremists, if I remember correctly in Cambodia...they have a man calling himself the Osama Bin Laden of Buddhism. 

[The Wiki on Taoism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism#Origins_and_development)

Again it's a mostly keep to itself faith.  Yes there are deities in it...but I do not recall any Taoists trying to change laws to benefit them in the West.  I have never heard about Taoist extremists or fundamentalists causing problems.  There probably are a few...but at least from my perspective it flies under the radar.

Hinduism in the West is pretty low key.  Again I don't know of any recent issues in the past 20 years of any stories of Hindu extremism in the west.  But They have a number of Gods...and well as we know...they do not exist as they are portrayed.  Though when you read some of thier anceint stories it sounds more like a space battles.  

[The Mahabharata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata) described what to modern people sounds like a space battle.  And as imporbable at is sounds...ancient humans mistaking aliens for Gods sounds more reasonable and probable to me then actual divine beings.  

Hindu's though have been known to use thier Blasphemy laws. :(

From the Hindus I have met they are very open and accepting of everybody.  Does not matter what your religion is they are happy to celebrate and honour it with you.  They just ask for the same consideration.  My wife teaches an Indian school.  Most of the students are Sihk or Hindu...and when something comes up in class where the 2 faiths differ even the students get riled up and have come close to fighting.  And this was only in a Grade 3 class.  So they are very passionate about thier faiths.

The main similarity with all 3 you mentioned is they really don't interfere with other people here in the West.  They are not expanisitic faiths.  I don't recall and tenants to kill non-believers.  These faiths have all roots in the same part of the world and grew and developed in relation to eachother.  Buddhists and Taoists in general are mostly people of peace and harmony.

Christianity and Islam both are expansionistic.  They both have tenants to go forth and multiply, to spread the word of thier God...by sword if needed.  Both religions have an abundance of Fundamental followers who are willing to use violence as an means to an end.  Both have and do campaign to change local laws to better suite them.

**TL:DR**  Eastern religions don't get as much attention from athiests because they generally don't bother athiests in Western Countries.  If Christians and Muslims did the same and just kept thier faiths to themselves athiests would have way less to voice concern over."

TheToastofBotswana,japan,1388789256.0,"I'm sure there are people better qualified to answer than me but I've been to Japan twice so maybe I can offer a few pointers.

Japan rail pass is a great buy for travelling. I arranged my trip for 8 days in Tokyo and 6 in Kyoto so I could cheap out and get a 7 day pass instead of 14. If you're travelling a lot it's most likely still worth your while to get a longer pass. 

Kyoto has countless temples and many of the must-see tourist spots. I recommend a day trip to Nara - it's just a short train journey from Kyoto. 

You may wish to go for a cheap business hotel in Tokyo and treat yourself to something nicer in cheaper cities. 

If flying into Kansai International you can get a special return rail ticket for a discounted price. There's also a prepaid card for subway and bus which is really convenient. If flying into Narita the limousine bus service is a good way to get into Tokyo cheaply.

Credit cards aren't as widely accepted as in other places so always have cash. You can use foreign cards to withdraw money from post offices (during opening hours) and from seven elevens.

I would contact the JNTO who will send you lots of good info, maps, brochures etc. for free."

We can sit here and debate abortion till we are blue in the face, but it will always be available, the supreme court couldn't even declare it unconstitutional in the Planned Parenthood v Casey case when the majority of the justices were conservative. You have to work within the system and realize that we should be proactive and not reactive, if you want to limit abortion you have to be willing to concede and realize that contraceptives may be more widely available where you live but not everywhere else.

cluberti,sysadmin,1388789891.0,"Honestly, if the original template was a production box, it won't matter.  Sysprep'ing an existing production machine to make copies for anything other than test is actually an [unsupported scenario](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/828287) by Microsoft - if that sort of thing matters to you (it does to most orgs with support contracts, at the least) you should be thinking about maintenance windows to take for rebuilding them anyway.

&gt; Microsoft does not support the use of Sysprep for the following scenarios:
&gt;
&gt;* To take a computer that has been running in production for extended period of time and run sysprep then create a new image or clone from the computer. Sysprep is designed to prepare new installations of Windows for imaging.
&gt;
&gt;* To run sysprep after imaging or cloning production computer for the purpose of changing the SID and computername to join the domain and make the computer unique. For example if you cloned or performed a Physical to Virtual(P2V) of a computer but want to leave the source computer running instead of decommissioning it.

If it was a template used for imaging, you still need to sysprep it to keep it supported by Microsoft (and yes, even though SID duplication shouldn't cause issues, it still does with products like WSUS or SCCM, and there could be others that I'm not aware of).  To your original question, there is a [KB article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216680) that might help determine if it was imaged with sysprep or not."

They aren't shitty people, they just used a very dishonest method to keep me safe. Very loving and supportive but overprotective people who inflate small problems to catastrophes.

A wizard is nothing that good length of steel cannot solve.

Some claim the difference between high and low fantasy is the motive. High fantasy is often involved in an epic quest to save the world or a people. Low fantasy is usually about obtaining treasure or revenge.

Their themes are quite different. Howard crudely states over and over that he's writing about the superior nature of savage men and the corrupting influence of civilization. Conan's ""thews steeled and his nerves whetted by the hardness of his life in the world’s wastelands.” While his unworthy civilized brethren will have ""muscles like rotted string"" and similar weakness of mind where they cling to wealth for its own sake.

Tolkien seems to take more issue with industry, while reveling in civilization itself, idealized as living in harmony with the natural world.

sir_sri,funny,1388791043.0,"Grading is not just reading.   The display type doesn't matter for most of us, we do all of our document creating and reading on regular displays all day everyday already.  

You need easy tools to mark things up, both office and adobe pro have tools to mark up documents, but they're not yet as good as scrawling all over a page, even when you have something like a laptop with a pen on it (which anyone who lectures with powerpoint, particularly mathy stuff should).  

Those tools are really designed for collaborative revision, for which they work reasonably well.  But grading is a one way feedback process. 

That's not to say you can't make it work, I've done lots of classes paperless with several hundred students.  Paper is faster to mark but you have to keep track of hundreds of assignments and make sure you don't lose any.  Electronic takes longer to mark and provide effective feedback  on, but then the feedback you do give is legible and ideally the whole thing is a bit easier to deal with appeals and mark entry is less error prone.  Though IT problems end up costing a lot more time than paper problems.  One student has a broken printer, e-mails you their assignment and you print it off.  The web assignment submission breaks an hour before the due date and half the class has a panic attack and then you have to manage 400 or 500 assignments submitted via e-mail, and get them to the right TA's to mark.  

Incidentally, the main bonus I have found to electronic submissions is that you don't get students submitting vulgar garbage without names (particularly to attractive female professors, of which I am none of  the above).  "

eetsumkaus,malefashionadvice,1388791308.0,"&gt; what separates fashionable and looking ridiculous? What separates things that are done deliberately and those that are clueless?

The answer to that is : whoever happens to be looking at you at the time, and whatever else is around you. Look at it this way : did the Grand Canyon *try* to be beautiful, or is it just so? Similarly, a lot of people think the Grand Canyon is just a big dry hole in the ground, big whoop, let's go see some beautiful tropical islands. Think of something else that is art, like music. Would you ever need to worry about what's ""fashionable"" in music? Like Duke Ellington once said, ""If it sounds good, it is good"". 

At some point, you realize that fashion, like all art, is about what *is* there, not what's *supposed* to be there. It's why many MFA'ers can appreciate variety from such diverse styles as /u/daou0782, /u/soundclip989, and /u/IndridCoId. You go from following rules, to following *intentions*, and it's a lot more beautiful that way. It also gives you more insight into ""pleb"" fits, and teach you to appreciate what it says about the person, maybe even draw inspiration from it, instead of judging what they did ""wrong"". 

This is where ""nxt lvl"" comes into play. It teaches you to listen to your own intentions and wants, instead of worrying about what's ""tasteful"", and striving to convey those intentions as clearly as possible instead. ""Nxtlvl"" happens because people can't find the language to express those intentions through commonly available pieces, and instead turn to more abstract clothing conceptions, like many artisanal styles, or techwear, or the many things that go into ""Japanese streetwear"". If you find yourself satisfied in MFA Uniform 1.0, then that's all there is in being ""fashionable""

tl;dr Don't worry about being ""fashionable"" or ""tasteless"". Just worry about being comfortable

Forget big ticket items.  You'll waste money on them.  Sure, they often give you a way to buy the item at ""retail"" and put towards your bids on that, but their version of retail tends to be more expensive than you can find in a real store.  Focus on small stuff like discount cards (Walmart, gas cards, etc.) or bids.  This is where you can get $50 of gas for $30 or a $100 Walmart card for $30.

Orbital - In Sides (1996) I was listening to a lot of punk and rock during when I discovered this album.  It opened my mind to the world of electronica as an 18 year old in 1996.  They became and still are my favorite band.  I want to Be Phil and Paul Hartnoll when I grow up.

Chemical Brothers - Dig Your Own Hole.  I never heard anything like this before when I bought this album

BT - Ima.  It's still my favorite album of his.  Blue Skies with Tori Amos and 'Loving you More' are incredible.  The second CD includes a 45 minute mix of the album by Sasha.  It was my introduction to my love/hate relationship with Trance music.

The Prodigy - Music for the Jilted Generation and Fat of the Land.  Can you think of another electronic music artist that had a better run than these guys?  Their music was mind-blowing back then!

**Robotics;Notes** [22/22]

So yeah, this happened. Pretty much everything up until the three-quarter mark was great - both the conspiracy and robot construction elements were interesting, and couples with a strong soundtrack, actually kept me guessing the entire time about what would happen. It's not often that I can marathon a show so easily; the last was, I think, *Girls und Panzer.* Everything about the first season and most of the second half was great, although the awkward tonal dissonance between episodes as they switched between the super robot and conspiracy plot-lines was weird (exacerbated by marathoning, it wouldn't have been so bad if I watched them only once a week.) I always had the niggling fear in the back of my head that they may not be able to contain all the plot threads into a proper ending, but I dismissed those fears, that it would be fine. 

Then that ending happened. Now, I'm not against happy shounen ""ganbarre!"" endings. What I *am* against is a happy shounen ""ganbarre!"" ending in a show that should more serious than that, one that invalidates a lot of the heaviness that preceded it. I think this is one of the best examples of a show that bit off more than it could chew and had to let shit spill everywhere, because that ending felt so messy and un-good. Several characters were waving so many death flags that it looked like the outside of the United Nations' NY headquarters, and yet didn't die. Apparently a massive pseudo-Illuminati organization can only obtain like one giant robot, and sends it as the only guard for a launch site that is the major hinge in their plans, and apparently you can get through to people who have been brainwashed for a decade by shouting loud enough, and just...ugh. Those random magnetic monopoles that fell out of the sky never get explained (I'll leave aside the stupidity that is ""building a motor"" out of them like that's something any JAXA engineer can do in his spare time.) Goddamit, *Robotics;Notes*, I wanted to love you to the end. I wanted to. But...I can't. What were you thinking?

On the character front, I'm happy to say that most of the characters are pretty enjoyable. I found Kona's otaku mannerisms much more grating than I did Daru's, although I felt she had the most romantic spark with Kai (although, him and Aki getting together was sort of inevitable so I'm not bothered). Kai himself is still a mixed bag, as it often felt like the show was actively forcing him to switch personalities to be active and explore the conspiracy when it was pretty clear all he wanted to do was hang around and play Kill-Ballad. 

Honestly, as much as I gripe about the ending and how unfulfilling it felt, I still thoroughly enjoyed everything else about it. I'd normally give something like that 6, but I'll bump it to an ""ambitious and entertaining but highly flawed"" 7. I think if you loved *Steins;Gate* (both that and *Robotics;Notes*, along with *Chaos;Head*, are part of the nitroplus/5pb's Science Adventure series), you'd enjoy *Robotics;Notes*, although probably to a lesser degree.

**Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru (series and OVA)** [13/13 - Rewatch]

This show was, surprisingly, not as much fun to watch the second time. My theory on this is that the discussion threads analyzed this show to the death when it first came out, which means there's very few little details to look out for that can make a rewatch interesting. The show, while very interesting when it first came out, doesn't have a lot going for it besides it's story - the art is bland and there's no bombast, fights or anything super dramatic. A little disappointing, but that doesn't diminish the fact that this was one of the best shows of the year.

Nonetheless, from that article:

&gt; All of this points to our entrenched ambivalence about changing gender roles. Men in these situations often feel alienated, particularly if they are surrounded by stay-at-home moms. But the power moms with the stay-at-home husbands are just as uneasy, often more embarrassed than proud that they’ve upset the traditional order.

Note that there doesn't seem to be a conflict between the men and their wives - they aren't judging their husbands - they just feel judged by society. I'm not sure where dating pressure is in that article...

And if you look at the [NYTimes article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/us/wall-street-mothers-stay-home-fathers.html?src=rechp&amp;_r=0) linked in the one above, it doesn't say much, but it does suggest that its societal pressure, not pressure from their wives:

&gt; Still, his wife, along with other women in the same situation, suspects that the arrangement is harder on the men.

""Gigantic"" and ""Silver"" were co-written with Deal.

Also, David Lovering, the drummer was a friend of Deal's husband. At her suggestion, he was hired. Kim also carried with her Albini as producer for The Breeders. Kurt Cobain has been quoted saying he wished Kim would have been allowed to write more for the Pixies.

Frank did some great song writing with The Pixies while Kim was with the band, no doubt. Kim did a great job laying the bass and singing what he wrote. Kim's done a great job writing with The Breeders as well. Different, but still edgy and colorful.

All in all, the tale of The Pixies is one with a little drama and strife between Kim and Frank. She wanted to do more, he didn't want her to. You can give Frank all the props you want, but don't discredit Kim either. When she left, she left with quick success and has done very well for herself since.

The Pixies was Frank's band in ego alone. I think he overlooked Kim's value."

I'm not sure what happened to it, but I don't think it spread (I mostly remember it from some fanart people getting worried about whether that would mean something for them). 

There are a bunch of Law and Order episodes that deal with fictional stuff (though mostly in written form) and what I gleamed from that is that it can't get anybody in legal trouble unless you can maybe argue that it's an instruction or a guide (kinda like those bomb building guides) and it basically doesn't happen out of Law and Order hyperbole.  

I think it also makes sense, I assume the legality would be kinda like a porn movie where an over age actress pretends to be underage. Now I'm gonna guess none of this is like graphical stuff that would make it count under ""obscene"" (the same way it would be considered obscene/NC17 worthy if a grown person or character was portrayed in the same situation).

After you feel comfortable at the bar/club, start looking for opportunities to talk to people. Don't be overly friendly or instantly want to be best buds. Just start striking up some 10 to 15 min worth of conversation. As time goes on you'll eventually make a real friend, then two, then three and so on.

For instance, they could ask for you to come over, and then sit down all together and go ""we're thinking of having kids... we'd like to discuss how that would affect all of us, and what to do for it to work for all of us"".

Instead, it seems they have discussions, decide what your role would be, and dump it on you with an unhelpful ""here is the door if you disagree"".

That's not a good situation for you to be in, evidently. I think what you can do is suggest a few things. First, discussions like the one I mentioned. Secondly, if they do talk while you're not there, which of course is likely to happen since they live together and might not want to stop talking about important things when you're not around, it would be good if they came up with a few different options, keeping your point of view in mind, so that when they approached you it wouldn't be ""oh by the way, we're going to do this"" but instead ""oh we were talking about X, and we came up with a few ideas, what would work best for you?""

femanonette,pics,1388793453.0,"&gt; when that buzz hit me my body completely collapsed

Your reaction to it is heavily dependent on so many variables: the type of weed, how much you smoked, where you smoked, *what* you used to smoke it (bong vs. joints, etc), if the hit was ""green"", and possibly based upon your prior exposures to it (I believe people build tolerances to it like alcohol).

If it was your first time and you took a massive bong hit, I'm not surprised it knocked your ass out. I used to smoke when I was younger and I found that it was all too much for me unless I just smoked a joint. It's different for everyone, my first time I didn't even get high, then again, I only took maybe 1-3 hits off a bowl.

&gt; But maybe the weed smokers aren't driving because they physically can't even get to that point

Unfortunately I have to disagree with you on this. Lots and lots of teenagers are driving around getting high in their cars because it isn't safe to do at home or anywhere else. Trust me, there are tons of people who get high while driving and listening to music because it's considered an activity. They will even find abandoned parking lots and ""[hot box](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hotbox)"" the car, then start driving around.

Even though I haven't smoked in *years*, I'm very excited for the legalization of it as well. I like that the legal market will be able to make distinctions and that you won't have to deal with shady drug dealers or hiding the activity. You'll get what you paid for and as long as you're responsible about it, you're free and clear. That's just incredible.

scooper1030,nba,1388793680.0,"Suns Bench:

Gerald Green (13 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 1.5 APG, 44% FG, 38% 3P): He's been fantastic after such a terrible year with Indiana, and I think most Suns fans really like the guy. He's the type that can heat up in an instant and drop 15 or 20 points on the opposing team in just 15 or 20 minutes. He can jump out of the gym as well as launch threes too. Unfortunately, he is a bit inconsistent and still has pretty poor shot selection. So when he's having a bad night, it can be ugly to watch.

Markieff Morris (12.2 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 1.0 SPG, 48% FG, 31% 3P): Markieff is having a breakout year, and he's attacking the basket a lot more than he used to while shooting fewer threes. He still takes a lot of inefficient mid-range ISO shots, but as long as those shots go in I can't complain. He is still very inconsistent though.

Marcus Morris (10.5 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 1.0 SPG, 44% FG, 40% 3P): A bit like Markieff, except Marcus is more of a tweener and plays a lot of small forward. He has more range than Kieff and can knock down those long-range threes. He's also quicker and a better ball-handler and passer. On the other hand, he doesn't have the size that Markieff does and can't post up/attack the basket as often. 

Archie Goodwin (3.3 PPG, 1.7 RPG, 40% FG): Archie isn't having a great rookie campaign statistically, but he plays the passing lanes very well and can make some great highlight plays. I like that he isn't afraid to attack the basket and draw contact. He still needs to get a lot stronger, but that should come as he matures and gains experience. Also, shooting 12% from downtown is atrocious. I really hope Hornacek can fix his shot. 

Len: Hopefully back from injury soon. 

Okafor: Hopefully he can play a few games at the end of the season (but I haven't heard any injury updates). If he could come back and help us in the late season/playoffs it would really boost our low-post defense and defensive rebounding. Right now Plumlee is the only great post defender we have. 

Dionte Christmas: The greatest player ever. I love this guy so much. Doesn't play much, but he's always full of energy and is always jumping off the bench in excitement whenever there's a highlight play. Whenever he makes a shot during a game I yell ""Merry Fucking Christmas"" at my TV/Computer.

Ish Smith: Not very good. His passing is alright, but he simply can't shoot. I wish we had a better backup PG for when both Dragic and Bledsoe are resting or when one is playing SG.

Slava Kravtsov: I root hard for him, but he hasn't impressed me that much. Every time he comes into the game I hope he can get a nice highlight reel dunk or block. He doesn't seem to excel at much, but isn't terrible for a fourth-string center either. "

I don't think that what they say are default settings for women ""in general' and that there are ""exceptions"", and I don't feel that way because of bias.

&gt;I think it is more the case that TRP'ers recognise that society pressures women to be seen to adopt certain behaviors and punishes them for not doing so

I don't think so...that's never the way they frame it. They frame it in terms of what women *really* want. And they are also big on slut shaming. Have you never heard any of them talk about the ""cock carousel"" that women ride? These are men who are happy to be the man that a woman's having a one night stand, but they'll turn around and judge her for ""riding the cock carousel"" (never mind that they volunteered to be one of the horses on that merry-go-round...derp!), and deem her no longer fit to date because ""she's too easy"". It's so illogical, but it's also, sadly, quite common there.

&gt;It isn't that women don't know what they want, they often do know what they want but are conditioned (societally) and pressured (socially) not to admit what they want and so sometimes have to come up with convoluted explanations that justify them fulfilling their desires without damaging their sense of worth. I believe that this is what some feminists refer to as an aspect of patriarchy. Regardless of the source, TRP'ers recognise this and have labelled it as hamstering.

That makes sense, and ""hamstering"" is a funny way to put it - it really can feel like you're running for all you're worth and going nowhere fast. There is a lot of pressure on women to be and do certain things; but I think it isn't fair to call it patriarchy, because there's also an awful lot of pressure on men to be and do certain things too. 

&gt;unwillingness to engage in debate.

Ha ha, oh man, some of those guys beg and beg to be debated...last time I went on there I had a handful of guys challenging me to a debate and they kept sending me pics from this ""Manhood 101"" site, posters which promised that I would in fact piss my pants if I tried to debate them because they'd beat me to death with their manliness and my poor little woman logic wouldn't hold up. lol It was magnificent. Never did end up debating any of them because their lame-ass website wouldn't work.

The birthdate starts out left shifted, centers as the text goes on, and ends up right shifted."
LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1388793956.0,"For what it's worth, my take on the situation: 

1.) Based on the articles so far this is from the EU version, NA version isn't out it, it's general assumption that they might get the same thing. The changes supposedly are these costume changes and the characters age number being changed from 15 to 18. Apparently the outfit is one optional costume for the character and the fighting system is apparently a job/clothing system like Final Fantasy X2

2.) So far there is no evidence that any outside body forced them do it. It's not unreasonable that they changed it for the moneys either to get a lower rating or because they figure it gains them less in the West. [think of it as the percentages of : people who are into it and to whom it would actually be an asset/buying argument vs. people who aren't into it but would be indifferent/wouldn't even notice vs. people who aren't into it]

3.) I kinda doubt that they consider it that integral to their artistic vision. If I compare that with the Quieth situation, it's pretty obvious that the creator is thinking of that design as part of a larger whole (if his statements are to be believed) hence it would make sense for him to stick to his guns about it. If it's insignificant to them that they would change it easily why care?

4.) Which brings me to: games get changed constantly. Australia requested changes due to some scenes that portrayed the taking of drugs. Germany constantly makes companies do low violence versions and that doesn't even cover all those games that have to replace swastikas with crosses =&gt; many changes where one could argue that they do a lot more butchering of the final product. There recently has a pretty lengthy article as well on what is changed in games and movies to make games reasy for Arabic countries. It gets done to movies as well constantly. Like that common joke about how in the EU version they cut out the violence and cut in the sex and the reverse in the American version. Little tweaks to make a game fit a market are pretty common and that doesn't even cover things that gets lost naturally by translation or dubbing. 

5.) Is it possible for modifications to be unproblematic? I would argue, yes, if the general artistic vision is preserved. The idea that a work needs to be kept completely unchanged is stupid. By that logic you wouldn't be able to fix a typo in book. Or be allowed to print two versions of the same book one with favorite and one with favourite based on whether is is sold in the US or the UK. I made an example over at r/games. Picture a game where a character orders a beer and they are 18 years old. The game creators meant for the scene to portray the characters ordering beer legally and they wrote them as 18 because for them that is legal age to drink. But it might sense to modify the age to 21 when releasing in the US because otherwise people might be confused about the (to them) underage drinking. Here going with the age people are used to might actually help preserve the original intention of the scene and if there are no other in game reasons as to why the characters have to be 18 rather than 21 why should it be a problem to have them changed to 21? 

I kinda see it as the same here. It's doubtful that they consider this aspect as being that integral to their vision. And if their intention was to be cheeky (and to signal ""totally of the age that is considered acceptable"") then the joke is preserved by changing the age to 18. Same if the message of the outfit should be ""kinda daring but not horribly"": =&gt; again makes sense to adapt it to potentially different tresholds (since I don't get the impression that it was ever part of their vision to do a super serious pledge and plea for 15-year old boinking). And it's not like they are turning to the character from a stripper to a nun, she still looks plenty of suggestive, just tweaked. 

Again, maybe they just really want that 12+ rating. *shrugg* "

A sociopath would do similar...in service to their own needs, feigning appropriate emotional responses to manipulate others.

Rage alone? No. Especially when Mycroft did indeed let him twist. That, if anything, was evidence that he's not perhaps a complete sociopath. Sherlock felt righteous anger.

A more practical use would be adjust the depth of field based on where the player is *actually* looking, not where the camera is pointed.

Horror game implementations are obvious. Being chased by a monster that is *always* just outside of your field of vision should be scary. Combined with biometrics (heart-rate monitor type stuff), this could make for really effective horror games.

A lot of this stuff you can basically do now be being clever, but you could say the same thing about the Oculus Rift. Or high resolution displays. Or color displays (well, maybe not color displays. But you get my point). How you interact with something matters.

But at ~$100, I don't think most people will think the benefit of eye tracking is worth it. While the consumer version should be less, it's still a high price point (if they can get it down to under $50 we may see a lot of uptake, but I don't think they'll be able to do that.

Porn should be free, the reason why child porn should be illegal is because a crime was committed during the creation of it (same for let's say spreading videos of a real rape  or real murder where you can presume that the people involved didn't give the consent for their picture to be used). 

Maybe, maybe they might eventually do a tweak (if they really wanted to) that suggestive portrayals of underage sexuality should be considered a ""mature topic"" (like let's say suicide or racism) and hence should put a game (or movie) in high rating category (like 16+ rather than 12+).

Numbchicken,PoliticalDiscussion,1388795241.0,"I know there isn't anything legally preventing that, there are mayoral races that are non partisan elections and I like those ideas, and it would be very difficult to do in this country. Its just an alternative idea I guess, since third party candidates historically have been more beneficial to one of the major parties instead of the election process. When Woodrow Wilson won his first election that is a good example, since Teddy Roosevelt ran as a third party candidate and took a major portion of the Republican vote which caused Wilsons victory, 

1992, with Ross Perot basically taking 19% of the votes which probably would have been GHW Bush's votes. 

While I was happy with the 1992 election results since I was a Clinton supporter, I do still think that for a third candidate to succeed, the only real way would be a non partison election or they'd really be playing spoiler instead of being a real viable candidate for President."

Given the same realization, a man could have designed an equally good product.  It's fair that it sometimes takes a personal experience to recognize the need for a new product or a feature, but implying only women are capable of managing and/or designing products for women is extremely sexist and frankly wrong.

This.

And sometimes it's not just phone tag, it's three phone calls and two texts just to get in touch with the guy, finally he once again says he'll call in an hour when he's on his way, two hours later he texts ""is it cool tomorrow instead man?"", you call him up, he's at his friend's place smoking weed and playing video games, eventually you get him to agree to send his friend to his place to pick up some weed for you (because he's too lazy to go himself), then when you show up at his friend's place they've already smoked 1/3 of he weed you were supposed to buy and he remembers he doesn't have any change so suddenly he's all energetic and says he'll be right back as he sprints back to his place to grab some cash.

wrathfulgrapes,socialskills,1388795809.0,"Hey man/woman, disliking texting is understandable; it's not a very complete form of communication. It can be difficult to navigate a text-based conversation due to the lack of many of the non-verbal cues we rely on.

Somewhat unfortunately, texting is a huge part of most people's daily lives (especially our age. I'm 23). So even though it's annoying and not always useful, it's something we all have to get used to.

I think the first thing you have to is lower your expectations, both of yourself and of the conversation. Don't expect it to be great communication, because it almost never will be. And don't expect yourself to do everything perfectly, because it's okay if you're not always sure about what to say.

A few tips:

Text as little as possible if you like. Hang out with people face-to-face if you want real human interaction. Leave the texting for figuring out plans, short messages, etc. They're not meant to carry a whole conversation. 

If people insist on texting, you don't have to give really long replies or reply immediately. Just answer with something appropriately brief whenever you get the chance. It's annoying to have someone habitually not text you back for hours (or not at all), but only the clingiest people will be upset if you don't answer immediately (and they're probably not worth your time).

It's also perfectly okay to make it known that you don't like texting. Make sure to not say it condescendingly (like you're better than others because you prefer talking), but you can mention it to people so they understand your preferences.

Are there any specific things you need help with?"

Wasn't there a recently hubhub where a Hollywood actress bitched on twitter because a scene where a man is suggested to be performing oral sex on a woman was cut and suggested that that was because there is still an unease with portraying female sexuality? 

Anyway, it is possible that they have rules that deal with the depiction of pedophilia or child sexuality, it's just that I'm not aware of it. And honestly, that's one of those situations where I think a higher rating might be appropriate since I could picture it adding to the weirdness for a child watching if the subject matter affect their age group more directly. But in the end, I think it's unlikely that you'd be able to do a workable solution for anything other than on actual on screen sex, because otherwise, where do you draw the line on what is sexy/too sexy and what about stuff like actually well intended sex education movies.

Aki's genki facade coming apart, then her coming to terms with her sister's dismissal, and finally that moment on the flight, as you mentioned, was a great conclusion to her coming-of-age arc. I was disappointed that they never explored Subaru, as what little we got of him greatly hinted at a conflict over desires over expectations (his father's expectation of him being a fisherman [because every parent wants their son to be a fisherman rather than an engineer, right?!] over Subaru's desire to be Mr. Pleides and work with robots). I was waiting for a personal episode like Junna's to explore his relationship with his father...which of course never came. Instead, they ended it rather flatly when his dad came to support him in the hangar. Disappointing.

On the sci-fi drama, I think there was one great moment right at the end, when you can see Kai uninstalling Kill-Ballad from his PersoCom, and was the moment that I really realized that just like Aki, he had been subconsciously been chained to Misa for years just like Aki (a point I think the show didn't make clear enough.)"

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1388796751.0,"&gt;I can't argue with that, but at the same time you need to take into account why there is rage there. If you accept that a lot of people there are there because they've been hurt badly in relationships and are looking for answers, need to vent and are frustrated, angry and betrayed then that goes a long way to explaining what you have highlighted. 

I have long suspected this to be the case for a lot of people who are sexist - they've had bad experiences with the opposite sex, sometimes with people they date and often from seeing one parent screw the other over big time while they were growing up. Sometimes it's because they see a lot of their friends get hurt in their intimate relationships too. I understand the anger; it's just misplaced. They cross the line from being angry at the person who hurt them - or the people who hurt their friends - and apply that behaviour to everyone who is the same gender as the ones they're angry at. 

&gt;These guys aren't sleeping with them, they'd like to be but such girls are too far out of their league. So instead they take solace that when said girls looks start to fade and their partner count means that they aren't sufficiently desirable to any guys they'd be prepared to accept settling down with and eventually turn to these guys that they too would be able to turn down said girls just as said girls turned them down previously

I get that. Sour grapes. They don't generally do a very good job of hiding that.  ; )  A girl is only a slut when she sleeps with everyone but you, as the saying goes.

&gt;Also, there is no logical inconsistency between wanting to have casual relations with girls who are physically attractive and serious relationships with girls that are emotionally attractive.

&gt;Apologies, it seems I wasn't clear. 

No no, you were clear! It just reminded me of all the challenges to debate that I was given. It was seriously amusing.

&gt;I meant that a lot of people are unwilling to debate with RP'ers because the subreddit comes across as so angry.

That's not the only reason...it's also that most people can see their views for what they are, and don't take it seriously. It would be like debating a flat-earther - sure, you could, but what's the point?
There is a huge logical inconsistency between being a man who is having a one night stand with a woman, and then turning around and judging that woman for having a one night stand, or judging women in general for engaging in the selfsame behaviour you just engaged in. It is hypocritical at best.

&gt;I'm sure you've heard the good lock and good key analogy before

I have, and it's bullshit. A good lock is one that only opens for one key; a good key is one that will open any lock. Ugh. Such sexist tripe. It boils down to the same old, tired notion that sex defines a man but defiles a woman. It's crap.

&gt;I won't go into detail about why discerning women are seen as better long-term prospects and undiscerning women are seen as better short-term prospects.

That, I can understand. I was never interested in dating guys that had a lot of *ahem* experience with women. I wanted someone with more conservative views. It's not a problem to want someone who hasn't slept with the entire football team...it's just that when you personally have had a lot of sex and think it's fine, but you refuse to date women who've had a lot of sex because they're not good enough, that's impossible for me to respect because of how contradictory it is, and because of the utter arrogance and blindness to self it displays."

IrideTheDirt,trees,1388796829.0,"What I find most interesting about this concept is this:
If people in neighboring states are spending their money on legal weed in CO, and taking it back home with them they are showing there is a demand for the product, and that they desire this product so much that they would rather drive to a neighboring state, buy from a safe and legal source, and risk breaking trafficking laws to take it home than purchase it within their state, illegally, and skip the drive etc. What this SHOULD say loud and clear to the Feds, AND the neighboring states is, YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON REVENUE BECAUSE OF POINTLESS AND ANTIQUATED LAWS! Therefore, your state should capitalize on the potential tax revenue being lost to the neighboring state, which is really what the trafficking laws are all about.
Unfortunately, This is not the message that will be received, because the media spin machine is already trying to demonize the people who voted the laws into being, and are making GIANT leaps, and were even speaking in past tense about the law before it took effect, on how it was increasing use among teens. 

Realistically, OP is dead on, obviously, this ""problem"" was considered, and will be dealt with as it develops. The thing is, these first few states to go full legal will be pioneering something we've never seen before, and there WILL be some unfortunate unintended consequences as a result. I image most will be small, and less of a detriment than the ""war on drugs"" and previous legal issues that resulted from it being a controlled substance. 

Fortunately, it IS harder to undo something, than it is to block it in the first place. Unfortunately, any small unfortunate consequence of legalization will be blown into front page news, and will, at least, delay full federal decriminalization, or legalization for recreational use.

Again, I don't claim to be an expert on twitch, but my impression is that despite all the hubhub the top people are still usually pro players or usually male funny ""personalities"". So all this angsting about sexy streamers seems to be taking place (at least from my perspective) on the lower levels of twitch popularity because if somebody actually made it to the actual top it's probably because they have some sort of other actual skills as evidenced by most generally not making it.

House of rep elections and senate elections are very important and people usually don't vote in those elections in high numbers, which allows interest groups and similar groups to take advantage and swing candidates to pander to their needs rather than the public. 

So you have nothing really getting done until people start voting in these elections. I think it was a few years ago, after the republicans regained the house, and maybe this is still the case, but Congress' approval rating was below 10 percent, so there should be major seat changes, but no that wasn't the case. So really, it may be easy to say the common folk would be able to run the country, but in reality with interest groups and gridlock, not too many people can really run this country effectively. "

In fact she was writing a lot of songs and Frank didn't want to have any of it, so she shared them with Throwing Muses and boom! New band formed and signed, The Breeders, and Albini produced Pod. Interesting you don't say who cares about Albini.

And, you're right. The Pixies is Frank's band as he sees it. That's why Kim was fired and later split. She's worth more than being just being a back up singer/bassist. Other musicians and industry folk have welcomed her value more than Frank ever did. That's Frank's loss. It's ours too.

But, this is all too common in the music biz with egos. All too common. So many forget about how great the music they're making together is and the effect it's having on all of us. You know, the giving piece.

Frank can have his band. Kim says the same. Viva La Kim. Death to the Pixies has happened for real.

The Pixies without Kim is sort of, and I do stress sort of, like Van Halen without David Lee Roth. There are those that like Sammy too. I liked em both, but they were different bands really. But, both David and Sammy had a big presence. Kim is that way. The situation with the Pixies is like having Gary Cherone in the mix. No one remembers Van Halen III as being great in any way. It's terribly forgettable. The Pixies need someone with something to add to the mix like Kim did. Frank didn't want that. The fans did and do though. It's rare a bigger person can come in a replace someone though. Van Halen got lucky. The Pixies without Kim probably won't. Kim put her signature on The Pixies whether Frank or anyone else says it's his band. It was theirs, not just his. Frank missed that, and so did a lot of other people.

Edit: Bad apostrophe."

Politifact also called Obama out on the lie when he ran a campaign ad with it. Feminists can't keep their lies up forever, sooner or later people are going to catch on. There was also [this recent article](http://www.nbcnews.com/health/girls-commit-dating-violence-often-boys-studies-show-6C10809607) showing that teenage girls are as violent and abusive with their partners as teenage boys are. The author did cite ""surprising new studies"" rather than point out that feminists have spent the last 40 years covering up hundreds of similar studies, but, the larger point is the mainstream media isn't bending to the whim of feminists as much as the used to. As egalitarianism becomes more and more popular, I'd expect to see an increase in similar articles that go against traditional feminist thinking."

I dunno...if they were pissed at a black person for hurting them and they were saying ugly things about black people, would we be so quick to give them a pass and declare that they aren't really racist?

&gt;You and I also seem to disagree about the hypocrisy inherent in judging men and women separately over sexual matters. I suspect this is due to ideological differences but I would hope that you understand enough of my perspective to recognize why I don't believe I am a hypocrite for holding differential standards for men and women even if you disagree with me? 

I don't agree with your opinion, but I respect you because you've been very respectful through this whole thing, and I've enjoyed our discussion.

But I don't agree that it makes sense to judge men and women differently in sexual matters. Sex is sex, and men and women aren't so different from one another that we should be held to different standards where sexual conduct is concerned. Physically women do have a bit more to lose, seeing as we can get pregnant; but birth control is leveling that playing field in a big way, and emotionally we don't really have any more to lose than men do. If having many partners is damaging to a woman, why would it*not* be damaging to a man? Furthermore, if you believe that having many sexual partners damages women, would it not hold true that male sexuality is therefore destructive and harmful in nature, seeing as the vast majority of these women are heterosexual? That's the thing about these views - not only is it sexist against women, by implying that we are somehow the gatekeepers of sexual morality, but it's also sexist against men as it strongly implies that men defile and damage women. I do not approve of double standards...they always exist to give one group an advantage, even if it's only a perceived one, over the other."

A rep of 1K on Stack Overflow isn't anything special (most of my friends are at 10K+, and some outliers are over 100K), and the apps mentioned are pretty simple stuff, the kind of thing someone might do  as a first project after  taking an iOS development course."
half_lurker,cscareerquestions,1388798158.0,"So in TDD there all sorts of tests. It really doesn't matter who added the test, or what type of test it is as long as it fails until you fix it. In our shop we like to talk about a cycle of **red, green, refactor**. The test is added in the red cycle (meaning the test will fail), the production code is added/changed to make the failing test green (as in the test will pass), and then we refactor if there is a need which would take us back to red, a failing test. To narrate it, I am going to use the simple example of a function that adds 2 numbers. For brevity, I will use nodejs for the language and be driven by unit tests. You will need nodejs and nodeunit to run the tests locally. If you need some help getting it set up, I can help, but I chose it because it should be fairly readable without expert knowledge in node or javascript.

**Red** the ""Add a Test"" part, where we would write a test for our desired functionality. The classic way to set up a test is with the 3 A's: **Arrange** (set up your test data), **Act** (invoke the thing your are testing with your Arranged data), **Assert** (verify that the Action did the desired functionality on your Arranged data). The test *should* fail because the functionality is no there. In our shop, we have a rule; no test, delete the code. There is still a little cowboy coding, but that is to sandbox a proof of concept and should not be production code. so let's write out first test, a simple test to see that we have our adder set up correctly:

**test.js:**

    //this is to set up our test suite, it will get out calc class
    var calc = require('./calc.js').calc;
    
    exports.test_class_setup = function (test) {
        //this test checks that we have everything setup and are running.
        test.ok(true);
        test.done();
    };

calc.js has not been made yet, because there is no test to say that we need it.

So with that, we run the test and we should get something like:

&gt; C:\test_dir\nodeunit test.js
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;module.js:340
&gt;
&gt;    throw err;
&gt;
&gt;    ^
&gt;
&gt;Error: Cannot find module './calc.js'

Hurray! We have a **red** failing test, on to the next step in the cycle, **green**! We will now try to do the least amount of work to make the test green. in this case, all we have to do is create a file calc.js. we do not need any code in the file, no exports, nothing. So we made our file and we run it again and get:

&gt; C:\test_dir\nodeunit test.js
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;test.js
&gt;
&gt;✓ test_class_setup
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;OK: 1 assertions (6ms)

FREAK OUT! We have our first test passing! **Green** is done, we have no code to **refactor**, so we move back to the top of the cycle, **red**, time to write another test, which will leave our code base like this:

**test.js:**

    //this is to set up our test suite, it will get out calc class
    var calc = require('./calc.js').calc;
    
    exports.test_class_setup = function (test) {
        //this test checks that we have everything setup and are running.
        test.ok(true);
        test.done();
    };
    exports.test_add = function (test) {
        //arrange
        var a = 1, b = 2, sum = a + b, result = 0;
        //act
        result = calc.add(a, b);
        //assert
        test.equal(sum, result);
        test.done();
    };

calc.js should have no code in it still, because there is no code coverage for it.

So with the new test_add function, we can see if the add is returning the correct value.

&gt; C:\test_dir\nodeunit test.js
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;test.js
&gt;
&gt;✓ test_class_setup
&gt;
&gt;✗ test_add
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;TypeError: cannot call method 'add' of undefined
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Failures: 1/2 assertions failed (11ms)

Great, so that is it for red, we have a failing test, we can move to green and write some production code. remember, the least amount of code to make it green. With the new guys we train I like to be a total jerk and return constants, because technically, that will make the test green and it forces them to think of clever tests. So we add the following code:

**calc.js:**

    exports.calc = {
        add : function (a, b) { return 3; }
    };

We run our tests...

&gt; C:\test_dir\nodeunit test.js
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;test.js
&gt;
&gt;✓ test_class_setup
&gt;
&gt;✓ test_add
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;OK: 2 assertions (9ms)

Great, our test passed, the green part of the cycle is done. Next we can refactor, which we will improve our test with:

**test.js**

    //this is to set up our test suite, it will get out calc class
    var calc = require('./calc.js').calc;
    
    exports.test_class_setup = function (test) {
        //this test checks that we have everything setup and are running.
        test.ok(true);
        test.done();
    };
    exports.test_add = function (test) {
        //arrange
        var a = Math.random(), b = 2, sum = a + b, result = 0;
        //act
        result = calc.add(a, b);
        //assert
        test.equal(sum, result);
        test.done();
    };

So now the test has been refactored to include random numbers, and I will have different values for each time I run the test. perhaps I will get lucky on the first try and a will equal 1, so I run my test.

&gt; C:\test_dir\nodeunit test.js
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;test.js
&gt;
&gt;✓ test_class_setup
&gt;
&gt;✗ test_add
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;AssertionError: 2.12578327 == 3
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Failures: 1/2 assertions failed (10ms)

Guess I was not lucky, but we have a red test, so I am now in the green phase of the cycle, and work on the production code.

**calc.js:**

    exports.calc = {
        add : function (a, b) { return a + b; }
    };

And we again run our tests...

&gt; C:\test_dir\nodeunit test.js
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;test.js
&gt;
&gt;✓ test_class_setup
&gt;
&gt;✓ test_add
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;OK: 2 assertions (10ms)

Awesome, green part of the cycle is done, back to red. We could go on and on depending on the requirements of the code, perhaps it does some special round for a back error not in your favor, who knows, whatever the requirements say, we write a test for which will fail.

The biggest part of all of this is that we are building out tests **before** we build out code. It reduces side effects, forces you to understand the requirements to write a test, and reduces the chances of introducing a bug later because your test would fail if you did (known as regression). It also ensures the bug is fixed because you can write a test for the exact bug and you will know when it is passing the bug is gone.

Sorry for the super long post (and all the edits), but in my experience, once you get a chance to join the TDD camp, you will not want to go back to cowboy coding for production code.


**TL;DR** The test in ADD A TEST could be an [acceptance test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing), [unit test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), an automated browser test (selenium or watin, or w/e), [regression test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing), [integration test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) or any other type of test. The key is that the test you add will *drive* you make a code change.

Blacks were freed from slavery. They got the right to vote. They got strong protections of their rights. We have a black president. MLK never met Obama. Frederick Douglas never saw Johnson sign the '64 act. Did they accomplish nothing?

Are blacks now perfectly equal to whites? No. They are poorer than whites and have much less opportunity as a result. Many are trapped in cycles of poverty that they could never escape. They are persecuted as the poor are in this country. So... did they lose?

In the real world, 'winning' and 'losing' has to do with your goals, which tend to change over time. Douglas saw the end of slavery, but he didn't see legal equality, not by a long shot. MLK saw legal equality, but no one alive or dead has yet seen economic equality in any meaningful way.

You'll accomplish nothing if you risk nothing. Maybe you'll not see your dreams absolutely accomplished in your lifetime, maybe your children won't either. But you fight *because it is right* and your contribution, and that of so many others, make little contributions towards the completion of a goal far too large for *any* one human being to accomplish. You can't be sure it'll mean something. You can never be sure. But you *tried.*

No, arguing with fundies or correcting someone on the internet doesn't mean anything. But you could plant a couple of trees. If you, and a few million other people, just one percent of all the people who will live on this planet plant a couple of trees, who knows how much of a drop in CO2 levels we could see. You, and a few million, yell loud enough and who knows what could happen. You're convinced nothing will. But in the past, it *has.* There weren't always laws against polluting, nor about child workers, or about the essential humanhood of black people.

There's no reason to believe that now no change can ever happen.  The only people who can answer that question will answer it after we die, when we see what the long-term effects of our actions will be. If enough people believe nothing can change, then nothing will change. If enough people believe they can, and *act* on it... who knows?"

There are thousands of good cops out there, but there are also thousands of them who are on serious power trips.

The term has been common in the west for ages. Also, many of the tropes associated with ninjas in popular culture can also be applied to those Middle Eastern assassins.

&gt; Assassinations were primarily carried out with a dagger, which was sometimes tipped with poison. Due to being immensely outnumbered in enemy territory, the hashashin tended to specialize in covert operations. Hashashins would often assimilate themselves in the towns and regions of their targets and, over time, stealthily insert themselves into strategic positions. They did not always kill their targets, however, preferring at times to try threatening an enemy into submission. This could sometimes be accomplished with a dagger and a threatening note placed on an enemy's pillow. The assassin group was indeed feared enough that these threats were sometimes taken seriously, as in the case when Saladin, the Muslim Sultan of Egypt and Syria, made an alliance with the rebel sect to avoid more attempts on his life. In the heat of battle however, under no circumstances did they commit suicide unless completely necessary, preferring to be killed by their captors.

I think for most emotionally mature guys what matters most when it comes to feeling needed is that it doesn't feel like you could walk out the door to go to work in the morning and drop them a text at lunch telling them to have their stuff out of the apartment by six because you've met someone new.

To be emotionally needed fits into this quite nicely, that it's clear that on an emotional level you don't want to be without **him** specifically and not that you just don't want to be single.

If anything I think it's healthier to need your significant other for emotional reasons than for practical ones (like money)."

If so, take political science classes, I also was an ""internet libertarian"" until I got to college, and now am no longer due to the classes I have taken and majoring in political science.  I don't believe in basically no government, and states shouldn't have as much power as most libertarians believe they should. I don't trust citizens in states directly coming up with legislation, and neither did the founding fathers, and anyways sometimes even Presidents who we may consider libertarians, or small government believers have made decisions which go against the constitution. When Jefferson agreed to the Louisiana Purchase, he knew it would help the nation but there was no constitutional power that gave the president this right, so Jefferson skirted around the constitutional powers by making the purchase a treaty. 

I believe the national government should have power, because if not for the national government, many state injustices would have occured. Look at things like double jeopardy, right to have council appointed if you cant afford council, and other supreme court decisions which implemented these things to states through selective incorporation. Sure you can argue states would have eventually implemented these things, but would it be worth putting these innocent people behind bars and then implementing these things which wouldn't even free those innocent people?

johnavel,Economics,1388799173.0,"[Here's the article text](http://sharetext.org/upHi) if you can't get past the paywall.

The key points:

&gt;Belfort and his accomplices fine-tuned his signature fraud through dozens of repetitions. Here's how it worked, in five easy steps:

1 Create IPO Stock: 

&gt;The first thing Stratton Oakmont needed was a business to sell, and the definition of ""business"" was very flexible. A judo school, a bagel maker, a newfangled water purifier, or a recovering alcoholic selling shoes out of the trunk of his car would do. What was needed was not so much an actual business as a business entity with a story that could be converted into publicly traded shares of stock through a Stratton initial public offering.

&gt;An important element of the scheme was that the Stratton IPO stock was not really sold to the public—it was sold to Stratton. Securities laws forbid underwriters like Stratton from buying more than a small percentage of the IPO stock they issue. To avoid this roadblock, Stratton sold all of its IPO stock to friends (nicknamed ""flippers"") like Madden, who immediately sold the stock back to Stratton for a small profit. The IPO stock was usually issued to the flippers at $4 per share, and then sold back to Stratton for $4.25 per share. This was a pretty nice deal for the flippers, who could pocket $50,000 or so from an IPO without breaking a sweat or risking a loss.

2 Line Up the Victims: 

&gt;Suckers aren't born, they're trained. Stratton Oakmont's salesmen would first gain the confidence of investors by letting them make a small profit on one or two Stratton IPOs. Once trust had been established, the Stratton salesmen would inform these customers that a really hot IPO was coming soon with a $4 issue price. Like all Stratton IPOs, the stock's price was expected to take off when it began trading in the aftermarket. An excited customer with $100,000 of savings might authorize the Stratton salesman to buy 25,000 shares of the IPO stock, and then transfer the $100,000 to his Stratton account. By totaling up all such commitments, Jordan Belfort knew exactly how much buying power Stratton's customers had.

3 Bait and Switch: 

&gt;Shortly before an IPO, the Stratton salesmen would call these customers and inform them that the IPO was so hot that the salesmen could offer only a (very) few shares at the $4 IPO price. However, the salesmen could create purchase orders to be executed as soon as the stock began trading on the open market. Many customers assumed that such orders would result in stock purchases near the $4 issue price, so they simply agreed. Some balked at giving the salesmen permission to invest their money without knowing the purchase price, or simply refused to buy stock in the aftermarket.

&gt;This was when the boiler-room hard sell depicted on screen began. The pressure on customers could be overwhelming, especially since they had already agreed to buy the same stock at the issue price: ""What do you mean you don't have the money to invest in this stock? You already gave me $100,000 to buy it at $4 per share!"" ""I made money for you before, and now you don't trust me?"" ""I'm never going to let you in on another IPO if you back out on me now!""

&gt;The Stratton brokers could have just placed orders in these customers' accounts without their permission, but they rarely did. Unauthorized orders were more likely to trigger complaints to regulators, and the move would have violated some unofficial boiler-room code of honor. These guys took pride in their ability to talk suckers into parting with their life savings.

4 Market Manipulation: 

&gt;Stratton Oakmont could have made millions of dollars just by selling its customers stock in nearly worthless companies for $4 per share, but after a couple of such IPOs, investors and regulators would have caught on. Instead, Jordan Belfort used the stock market to camouflage his theft.

&gt;Let's say that one million shares of the IPO stock had been issued, and Stratton's customers had committed to buying $12 million of the stock in the aftermarket. Belfort would therefore want the stock price to rise from $4 to $12 per share before selling it to them. Having bought all of the IPO stock back from the flippers, Belfort and Porush could make the stock trade in the aftermarket at any price. The simplest way to do so was to buy and sell shares between Stratton accounts at increasing prices, but that would have been too obvious. The same result could be accomplished by having friends buy small amounts of stock using ""market orders,"" which buy shares at the lowest price offered from any seller. The only seller was Stratton Oakmont.

&gt;As soon as aftermarket trading commenced on IPO day, the friends of Belfort and Porush started placing these small market orders. Stratton would simultaneously sell its stock using ""limit orders,"" which offer stock for sale only above a specified minimum price. After each sale, Stratton would place another (sell) limit order with a slightly increased minimum price, and the friends' market orders would execute at each higher price.

&gt;What the market recorded was a steady progression of trades at $4.25, $4.50, $4.75, all the way up to the $12 target price. The run-up from $4 to $12 could be accomplished in minutes. This was a common first-day trading pattern for legitimate hot IPO stocks during the 1990s, so the manipulation wasn't obvious.

5 Sell High and Shut the Door: 

&gt;When the IPO stock price hit the $12 target, Stratton executed its customers' buy orders. This was the payoff moment when Stratton got the victims' money and the movie's over-the-top partying began.

&gt;Had customers holding the inflated stock tried to resell it quickly on the market, they would have found almost no real buyers, and the stock price would have plummeted about as quickly as it had risen. Such an early price crash was rare for legitimate IPO stocks and would have attracted regulatory scrutiny and scared away future Stratton victims. So Stratton made a practice of supporting the high price for a while—usually about a month—by buying any of its IPO stock offered for sale on the market.

&gt;But letting customers sell their stock for $12 while Stratton Oakmont was the main buyer would defeat the entire purpose of the scheme; the victims had to be discouraged from selling too soon. Stratton brokers could usually do so by heaping more hyperbole onto investors who called to place sell orders. (Stratton operated before Internet self-service brokers like E*Trade enabled most investors to place their own orders).

&gt;When customers couldn't be talked into holding on to their stock, their sell orders would usually just be lost and their phone calls ignored. When the sell orders were finally executed, there would be few buyers, the stock would crash, and the customers would be wiped out. By that time Belfort had the next IPO ready and was lining up new lambs for the slaughter."

EaglesOnPogoSticks,starcraft,1388799207.0,"&gt; When has arbitrarily making something harder ever been good design? Isn't that why they got rid of limits on control groups?

Yes, I believe that's exactly why they removed that. As for whether that's good game design, well that really depends on what you want to call good game design. *What I'm interested in is whether it makes the game better or not from a competitive standpoint*, and a lot of the streamlining that Blizz has done going from BW to SC2 has in my opinion been detrimental. Again, not all of it. For example, I think that automatically sending the first six workers is fine for reasons explained elsewhere.

If we're talking specifically about the control groups, I think that (in practice) completely removing the limit has been detrimental. It made controlling armies much harder, and in my opinion, made the game much better because it was another thing which required skill to do on top of everything else that went on in the game. 

It's also important to remember the context that these things existed in. I don't think the 12 unit limit would work at all in SC2 because of how efficient the AI has become. Any attempt to attack would inevitably fail because it would be nearly impossible to coordinate things well enough. But if we're talking about the AI in BW, then we're talking about a different beast. In a game where tanks don't have smart-fire and just getting dragoons to go up a ramp, the control group limit doesn't break the game."

Rather, the function of moderation is, in my opinion, to create a positive forum environment.  Reducing hostility is the key thing here: hence, fighting sexism and intolerance but not fighting people who believe that greed is good or people who believe that homosexuality is (or is not) sinful.

Express to her how you feel like you've lost an important part of your friendship, and try to understand when she initially doesn't seem to get where you're coming from. 

A lot of people seem to have been in at least one relationship where they find themselves completely infatuated and end up neglecting their family, friends, and responsibilities. Ideally, when bigger consequences happen or the relationship ends, we learn not to put all of our eggs in one basket and to nurture our own lives and interests outside of the person we're dating. 

Like I said, if the friendship is important to you and your attempts to get through to her fail, be patient. Focus your efforts on other friendships and interests, and hope she comes around. One of my friends ended up learning a lesson and has never again neglected her friendships for a relationship. Unfortunately, I had to eventually cut ties with another, as she, 10 years later, is still locked in this same pattern. Good luck."

YoungFolks,asexuality,1388800243.0,"So I've been in several LGBTetc organizations over the last decade. Let's see how my experience relates. 

&gt;In my mind, the lgbt society exists for two things. The first is counselling

Yep. This is true. And finding community, friends, and a support structure. 

&gt;The second is to have a group of people to go to the gay bars with.

Wait, what? What kind of lgbt organization does your uni have? All the ones I've been exposed are more about group activities centered around community and the campus, not hooking up. They organize events like picnics, hikes, conventions, queer prom, drag shows, etc. People *from* the club may go to gay bars together, but they do that on their own, not as members of the lgbt organization. 

&gt;So is there any point in me joining the club when I go back in a week? 

If you want. Most universities have a day when all campus organizations advertise themselves to draw new members. Go to the club table that day and ask them what they do, and if it actually is just clubbing, or if it's other stuff you might find interesting. 

&gt; As far as I can tell asexuals are few and far between and I'm not too likely to find any other asexuals there. 

You never know! There might be some there. Amd even if there aren't you can be the first. Represent our people! And you can still talk to people about asexuality. The people there will likely be able to relate to some things, like coming out, accepting yourself, dealing with family, etc. 

&gt;Anyway, am I right in thinking that lgbt isn't worth my time or have I got it all wrong

I think you're not giving them the benefit of the doubt. Talk to some members, or email the head people and ask them these questions. Once you know what the demographics and activities of the club *actually* are, then you can decide whether or not it's your thing.

It was a mom &amp; pop type place, and they let me bring in a few things like my video game consoles to test it out.  Their display model had been running a static image for over 20 hours straight and there was no image retention when I plugged in my PlayStation to test out some things.  (And until the Kingdom Hearts Remix, I never saw any image retention at all, but those go away when just watching other TV.  Static blue images for hours on end don't seem to work well with it.)  With the new consoles coming out, I had to move my PS3 onto my other TV due to a lack of HDMI slots on my sound bar.  It really is like night and day in terms of picture quality, hence why resale values have barely dropped since it was discontinued in 2009.   It's just that there's more than quality to be considered into why a product can be discontinued.  Being the best at something doesn't guarantee success."

I realise with crops this isn't likely but I don't know of any tests that are done that I would consider sufficient that are applied to all GM crops to make sure that they don't have a good chance of establishing and becoming invasive. Just because we didn't do such tests in the past doesn't mean we shouldn't be doing them now.

Plus I would argue that it's not as prevalent on the left as a lack of care about the environment is on the right. I would also point out, somewhat anthropocentrically considering my argument above, that our future as a species is not at risk because of GMOs.

(up to $250k). This is also why US Treasury Bonds are considered the safest investments you can make anywhere in the world, because, no matter what, the US government will honor those bonds, just as the government will cover up to 250 thousand dollars deposited into a bank they cover. The government can do this because they can basically print as much money as they please so people will always get money owed to them. It might cause massive amounts of runaway inflation, but you *will* get your money. Everybody around the world trusts the US government to do this, and there never really has been any real reason to doubt it, which is why the US's ""full faith and credit"" is the best in the world (ignore all you hear about credit rating agencies, they are political circuses).

Now, I qualify this all as ""virtually 100% guaranteed"" because if it ever becomes a reneged on position, something has gone *very wrong* in the world (massive world war, possible societal collapse, world wide natural devastation) and fiat currencies will become the least of your worries."

messiahwannabe,HistoryPorn,1388801314.0,"a response to basically everyone who's post got deleted,

by messiahwannabe

anyone still bothering to read this (probably no one and i'm talking to and empty room - so be it)  the comments deleted here made several valid points.  you can probably guess, some people thought i was being sexist.  maybe i was.  but, i just feel like everyone was very much missing the crux of my argument. perhaps because of my flippant choice of words? my apologies, i just do that sometimes.

look, personally, i don't care at all about how young and attractive the women, and to be fair, occasional man, serving me my in flight meals are. what matters to me is - and probably the people commenting below would scoff at this, but if you reread my original comment, this is exactly my point from the beginning - what matters to me is how happy those flight attendants are.

it matters to me, and all the other people on the plane, because, hey, it's a small crappy tube of metal we're all stuck in, and who wants to be trapped in such a place with someone who is clearly angry and hostile? on flights in america, i just run across employees who very clearly hate their job, all the time. if you fly much, you must surely run across more than a few of these disgruntled airline workers as well. who likes to see a fellow human being toil in misery? the truly disgruntled flight attendant looks to me like possibly the most miserable worker on the planet, radiating malaise and crushed dreams like no mcdonalds wage slave or bored factory worker i've ever met. probably because it's an exceptionally tough job, the long, odd hours really take a toll on anyone not absolutely full to the brim with perk and vigor, and at the end of it they'll be sleeping it off in an anonymous hotel room, a thousand miles from their family. who could blame those feeling stuck in their job for being blatantly unhappy?

on the other hand, on airlines where there seems to be some sort of age limit on how long you can remain a flight attendant, the flight attendants just. seem. happier. you're right, they could be faking it - it's a service industry job, and like a waiter, bartender, or anybody else dealing with the public, you're expected to remain civil, and encouraged to be friendly and personable. however, while i'm not saying i'm a mind reader, neither am i some scrooge feeding off other peoples misery, pinching and bossing my way through first class (i always fly coach for starters) oblivious to all but my own needs and desires. i can tell an eye smile from a mouth smile. animated conversation from a from hushed gripe session. it's easy enough to read stress and strain from posture, and anyone in the world can read a full on scowl that lasts the duration of a 5 hour flight. some of you may not want to hear it, but if i'm any judge of human character at all, the flight attendants on asian airlines are simply happier at their jobs.

i do not think they are pretending ""because their necks are on the chopping block"" - i believe that while they are within the age range considered acceptable to hold this particular, somewhat singular job, they are as secure in their employment as anyone else at the company. they certainly don't read as ""scared"" to me - rather they tend to radiate brisk confidence, and pleasure in taking a rough job and grabbing it by the horns.

if the flight is half empty and there's nothing to do, one may come sit down across the isle from you and start up a conversation that becomes flirty. i have friends that do fly first class, and occasionally one or two of them has been known to get a date with a flight attendant. but i've certainly never ever seen, say, someone grab a woman's ass on an asian airline. i don't know how many of you have traveled in the area, but personally i find most of the women i meet in south east asia are quite confident and not to be trifled with. especially the ones working these jobs.

so. here we arrive at what i think is the, perhaps unrepairable rift in our points of view. you (pl.), if i understand your many many comments on the subject correctly, feel that any discrimination over age (and looks) whatsoever, is untenable. it's morally wrong, and to suggest otherwise makes one an obviously heartless villain straight from a dickens novel.

i tend to agree, generally speaking. but, for me, the world is not black and white. ideally yes, anyone should be able to do this job if they desire, and are competent. unfortunately, in this particular case, it seems to me that there are factors which make it simply more practical, and just better for everyone involved, to do things the way the asian airlines do it. to me, it's the american system that seems shallow and heartless. scared of being sued, unable to just take the steps that work so well in other places all over the world, to make things more pleasant for everyone involved, a system that makes people miserable is created and propagated to perpetuity instead. all in the noble, but in this case misdirected, interests of fairness and equality.

look, my guess is that these women are not fired at 28 - they are simply moved to positions that don't involve traveling 4 to 7 days a week. whereas in america, inertia takes over, and many flight attendants remain in jobs that clearly aren't suitable for everyone. is there no case possible for you where the strict rules of equal opportunity employment can be bent, fudged, redirected in a more positive way? i understand if you feel they can't - you and the rest of america, you know? everything there has been written in stone, last week. (or rather, at some point between ~1972 and today)

i'm just describing a different set of circumstances where i feel the world is a better place, for everyone. because of the unfairness. because some practical level of moral ambiguity is allowed for. like i said in another comment, it is a conundrum, no?

i'll tell you what though, i'm not looking forward to my flight on american airlines next month. neither is anyone else."

Although I missed the Argentina trip, I do remember the ladies on my team talking about playing against women who were barefoot. The infrastructure for organized clubs didn't support women playing very well.

I did get to go on the trip to England/Paris (we had a 2 week spring break and could do 2 cities). Our men's team got totally smashed by a couple of clubs, I think they lost 2/4 games so they did alright overall, but when they lost they lost hard! but I remember being happily surprised that the women's team were so successful. This was about 8 years ago at this point, but our women's team played a much much more physical game than any of the English or British teams we were matched against, and we won all 5 of our matches.

Now of course this is circumstantial, and I did play for a pretty decent collegiate women's team at the time, so who knows? I think women's rugby in the USA has picked up a lot of talent because there's really no other comparable sport for American women, where a lot of guys that men's rugby get guys who used to play American football.

Yep.  ...and the President modified the law repeatedly where it gave him no such discretion.  ...which means that to Constitutionally do what he did would require that Congress pass laws modifying it.  That didn't happen.

&gt; This is why this talking point is so damn stupid. The law is being followed exactly as written.

Not even close.

&gt; The Secretary has wide powers to adjust dates of implementation and that's exactly what she is doing. 

Please cite the specific provisions of the law that allow the Secretary to modify the dates of implementation.  That's a talking point the left uses often, but nobody ever cites the law - because it isn't in there.

&gt; Congress and staff were not given waivers. They were given cost sharing.

Which was fucking stupid...because you still only have the staff you have.

Three heart patients and a stroke can totally take up an ER doc's time.  There may be 17 beds...but it's the critical nature of the patients that is the biggest factor.  Some days, you didn't have a lot of serious patients.  Other days it was utter chaos.

You would end up with a full ER and beds in the hallway with pissed off patients because they had no privacy and they were waiting for a doc that was busy with seriously ill patients.

I will NEVER forget the day that we had a full ER with serious patients and we got a double trauma code pink.  This meant two kids were coming in and they weren't breathing/no heartbeat.  In this case it was a fire and the kids were two.  Now... this gets announced over the loudspeakers.  The ER goes into a VERY serious mode with every department responding...mobile X rays.  Other staff from other parts of the hospital showed up because we were so inundated otherwise.  And EVERYONE is in a dread panic because we know that KIDS are coming in... in GRAVE condition.  Kid deaths are the worst deaths in the ER.  They can shake you for months.  You don't miss this in the lobby, either.  You hear the announcement.  You see the response.

And right when the kids are arriving and everything is hectic... a medicaid patient waiting in the lobby comes up and says, ""I know you are busy and all... but I've been waiting a half hour and MY throat REALLY hurts!""

And.  You.  Are. Polite.

Even though you want to say, ""Hey...sorry about your sore throat..but someone's kids might be DYING today (one did) and you need to sit down and wait for critical patients to be taken care of.""

You say, ""I'm very sorry.  In the ER patients are seen in order of the serious nature of their illness.  We will see you just as soon as we can.""

Yes, ER's only have to stabilize a patient.  But if you come in with a sore throat.  You will be treated by an ER physician or PA and you will get a script for meds.

I know I know, what your thinking but, teens have been smoking weed atleast in Denver forever. With the law stating only people 21 or older are allowed to purchase, I think it's going to become harder to get, kinda like how alcohol is in a way.  

To those that keep saying move to Cocaine, and other harder drugs. I just don't think that's going to work. Things like Crack and pure Cocaine haven't been used by the masses since like the early 90s at most.

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1388803662.0,"Your friend doesn't know what he's talking about and I doubt his mechanic skills. He might be or used to be an OK mechanic, but he doesn't know anything about transmissions. The torque converter is an outside component from the transmission but it feeds into the transmission by way of the torque converter hub into the transmission front pump and input shaft. If the torque converter goes bad and starts spitting metal it absolutely CAN and WILL go into the transmission causing problems.

If the transmission shop says you have metal in the pan I wouldn't doubt them. You can go to the transmission shop yourself and see the metal in the pan. Also, even though it's a moot point now, do you know what transmission trouble code you had when had the check engine light come on?

I'm not there so I can't diagnose or know what happened to your transmission, but if the transmission shop says the torque converter grenaded, then I don't, as a transmission tech, have any reason to disbelieve them. Torque converters go bad. 

Many people think transmission problems can be fixed with just a simple shift solenoid. Transmissions are much much more complex than that. And in my experience shift solenoids rarely fail, not as commonly as other parts of the transmission fail. Solenoid failure is often a symptom of a bigger problem. So 9 times out of 10 if you have solenoid code/problem/failure it's likely because there's metal contaminants clogging it up which means further impending transmission failure, or the hydraulic circuit that is controlled by the solenoid is blocked or jammed, which again means metal contaminants coming off something causing problems.

So yeah, I think you have a transmission problem. And $1700 is pretty fair for a rebuild on it as well.

If you have anymore questions, hit me up. I rebuild transmissions.  "

To get around this issue, use a mounted VHF set, wired into external speakers on deck, and a fairly large antenna mounted a proper distance away, nice and high, with a thick-gauge shielded cable.

Lastly, be warned, if you are aiming to get a license from the Coast Guard, there *is* a hearing requirement.

After the break ups ( I am old and have had more than one) everything I gave as a gift were still gifts. I did not expect them back. 

Even from the fiance who decided not to continue after all.

Gifts in general are not items of barter, nor are they for sale. An exception might be an heirloom or other thing of similar nature.

Engagement rings are also non returnable from my point of view. That may be the pre active cheapest divorce ever and a warning to me for the future about rash decisions."

Guess what the poor do with windfalls: They spend it almost immediately.  When they spend that money it returns to the economy, where it can do more than make someone rich while also stimulating far more people's jobs than a rich person spending the same amount would.  Mostly because buying for 1 family, even in the same amounts financially, will never distribute as large, and thus never help as many people as giving a large sum and dividing it across a wide area.

Or let's put it another way:

Here's a pile of money.  Take 200 dollars from that pile, and give it to 200 people who have no money at all.  They then spend that money, in effect giving it to between 1 and 200 different people who also didn't have money before.  Whereas if it was spent by one person, they would only be able to spend it on 1 person (if you treat a company as a person)"

As a result they've developed a very quick reacting land force, supplemented by a very capable Royal Navy. Meaning that it is, along with France and the USA, one of the only Militaries truly deployable anywhere at a moments notice.

If they flake on you last minute they don't even have to ever see you, so what does it matter?

behindtimes,truegaming,1388805726.0,"I think a lot of this has to do with it being a new experience to the user.  It seems like you've played adventure games before, but you need to remember that for the majority of the audience, they haven't, as the genre has been pretty much dead for awhile.

For example, back in the 1980s and early 1990s, 2D platformers on consoles ruled.  The PlayStation came around, and all of the sudden everything had to be 3D.  This included Nintendo.  Yet, when Nintendo released New Super Mario Bros., it outsold the 3D variants of the series.  It's not an old is new, because for much of the audience, they've never experienced the old.

Telltale succeeded partly in my opinion because of the popularity of The Walking Dead (the TV series).  That allowed it to bring an adventure game back to the spotlight and introduce a whole new generation, even if they're not the best in the business."

Second pack, there's nothing too inspiring, though I do like the Cyclonic Rift. I'd also consider picking the Fetid Heath and hope to pick up Godless Shrine from the first pick on the rebound.

Third pack, I want something white to solidify a deck. Elspeth and Helix suggest aggro, so Windbrisk Heights fits pretty well into that sort of deck.

temp9876,AskWomen,1388806953.0,"Wow.  That's, wow.  No, shampooing in the shower will not harm your vagina.   Unfortunately, it's such a total non-issue that I can't even point you at resources that say so!  [Here](http://teens.webmd.com/girls/your-vagina-15-things-every-owner-should-know) is one article for teens about vaginal health, point #2 even mentions that it is ok to shampoo your pubic hair.  The important thing with shampooing in the shower is that nothing is getting IN your vagina, or even in between the labia under normal conditions.  Shampooing in the bath would bring products in closer proximity but still not typically an issue, it is a good practice to rinse off with the shower after a bath anyway, a quick rinse of the undercarriage in either case is all that is needed.

But I don't expect her (or you) to take my word for it, I'm a total stranger on the internet. 

Here is what you do:

1. Find a female doctor or sexual health clinic, make an appointment alone first to speak to someone about your daughter's concerns and arrange an appointment for your daughter that she can attend with out you to learn about good feminine hygiene and discuss her worries.  It is important that you meet first so that if your daughter is too shy to ask questions the concerns you know about will still get answered.  

2. Consider installing a detachable shower head in the bathroom she uses at home or in whichever bathroom has a bath/shower combo.  A hand-held shower head will let her wash her hair in the bathroom without being in the shower and spare your kitchen sink.

It is really hard to break this kind of misconception when it is coming from her mom, if you can address the issue at the source (mom) that's ideal but otherwise give her access to good information and adapt as best you can to her quirks."

As far as I'm aware, quark matter - though producible in neutron stars - would not remain quark matter outside of one. Although quark matter is dense as fuck, it's not a popular state to remain in. Not to mention that it is *highly* visible, since it's practically shitting out energy in cooling down and expanding if it's not being held at the immense necessary pressures.

The idea of small black holes being dark matter is patently absurd. We know that the effects of dark matter are different, even visibly so. A black hole distorts the light around it - dark matter is invisible and has no known interaction with anything (which is why it's so damn hard to find). We just know of the consequences of its existence as matter with mass, like its effect on the background radiation and its gravitational presence in galaxy and large structure formation and weak lensing.

And trying to link your ideas to supersymmetry right now is a *bad* idea. Though it hasn't been proven wrong by any experiment yet, the Higgs' mass was a pretty *heavy* blow to it.

Also, as someone with poor sight, I was confused by how the picture of a honeycomb was tied into dark matter.

Buttheads don't give a shit about your actual cred, and when they do, it has to be 10x that of a dude. Even *then*, they'll say you're lying, faking it, not actually a woman, got a man to do it, *anything.* But it's not just being told ""Hey, your code sucks!"" that's a barrier. It's things like being denied jobs, hostile work environments, and a Women Can't Do STEM attitude that prevents women even *trying* to learn those skills.

Misogynists exist, but whether it works or not, ""So don't let them know you're a woman!"" is the wroooong answer to that. We didn't fix racism by having POC wear disguises, gain people's trust, then pop out like SURPRISE YOU HAVE A BLACK FRIEND WHAT NOW.

Effect of height: Little to none. Schools in Canada admit students solely on the basis of marks and extracurriculars (no interview unlike the USA). I work entirely online.

Breakups virtually never are fun but come on, /u/cardsau, what your friends correctly would think of her upon learning this information is exactly what you *should* (and on some level probably do) feel.  When bad relationships are at issue almost everyone (ir)rationalizes, ""That would be true for everyone else but *our* situation is different,"" but that is complete bullshit as, again, almost everyone realizes after the fact (""the fact"" being the period in which such people (unfortunately including you) demean themselves by staying in a horrible situation because they cannot bear to admit that a relationship they wanted to have succeed irretrievably has been compromised).  Dump her ass already.  I know that this advice is the last thing you want to hear but, as someone who has been down this road, believe me, you need to get the fuck out a.s.a.p.  You know your friends would say the same thus you willfully withhold from them information that you already know would lead them to say so far more ardently than I have.

Alternately, is she in preschool/day care? She'll learn a lot there.

Does she run to the other room or hide when she poops? That's the sign she's ready for potty training. if so, buy a pot on Amazon and research on the internet on how to do it. It's not hard, just takes time.

Borrow more books from the library. they're free and she'll learn more. Also, many libraries have group time for toddlers. You can meet other parents. Let them know you're a single dad and I'll bet you make friends pretty quick. I'd invite you over for a beer and a playdate. 

Put on music and dance with her. 

You should buy ""What to expect, the toddler years"" or something like it. It's packed full of developmental advice.

Most important, you don't have to teach her much at this age, what's more important is play, keeping her close, loving her and hugging her and making her feel secure. You're obviously good dad, so keep at it."
