Willravel,Fitness,1388607153.0,"I was born with a coarctation of the aorta, meaning there was a severe pinch in my descending aorta, the large blood vessel that leads blood to an arm and the lower part of my body. My life expectancy without repair was about 25-30. I had surgery which repaired the coarctation by removing the pinched section with a Dacron (polyethylene) tube. I was told by my doctors that, for the rest of my life, I could never be physically active beyond simple exercise like walking and lifting very light weights. 

This is the year I've finally surpassed my initial life expectancy by reaching 30. Working with my cardiologist, for the past 16 years, I've slowly but surely improved my physical condition. I take an hour walk every day, I strength train three times a week, and I get out and do physical activities like hiking and light jogging, which were, other than the walking, supposed to be beyond my physical capabilities. It's been incredibly frustrating at times, because I can't push myself the same as people without my condition, so it takes me ten times as long to improve from exercise. The nice part is that when I do finally achieve goals, they're incredibly fulfilling. A lot of people with a coarctation of the aorta repair end up being overweight because it's so difficult to stay active. I'm at around 16-17% body fat and great energy levels. 

As of October of this year, my cardiologist estimated that my life expectancy is likely between 85 and 95 years. Blood tests, blood pressure, stress test, and everything came out well above average health.

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1388607262.0,"&gt;May 1: Death of Ayrton Senna, internationally celebrated Formula One champion, in an accident during a Grand Prix in Italy

And on this, I highly recommend the documentary *Senna* on netflix.  It's a bit of a tear-jerker, but it gives a lot of insight into what being an F1 driver is like.

Anyway, there are several very important events for Jewish history that happened in 1994:

1. The cave of the patriarchs massacre
* The Argentina bombing
* The Israel-Jordan peace treaty
* Oslo 2

So in order:

The cave of the patriarchs massacre was when Baruch Goldstein, a Kahanist (religious ultra-nationalist) opened fire on a crowd of Muslim worshipers.  He was active in the ultra-right Kach party and in the JDL.  Wearing his military uniform, he opened fire in the Muslim part of the Cave of the Patriarchs, killing 29.  While he was celebrated as a martyr by the very far-right (he was killed by worshipers), the Kach party was banned, and the ultra-right was somewhat marginalized.

The bombing was a car bomb in front of the head of the AMIA, an Argentinian Jewish organization, killing 85.  It was just two years after the Israeli embassy in Argentina was bombed, killing 29.  No one was ever convicted for the former bombing followed a bungled investigation.  A neat bit of trivia is that a local bishop was among the first to condemn the bombing, and began working with local Jewish organizations afterwards.  That bishop, of course, became Pope Francis.

Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994.  This followed decades of the countries talking through back channels.  It was the second peace treaty with an Arab country.  While not as militarily significant as the treaty with Egypt, it meant that Israel only had a relatively short hostile border to defend.  Of course, relations between the countries had been warming long-term, which included Jordan's non-participation in the 1973 War.  This was also essentially the very end of the old Revisionist dream of a Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan.

Oslo 2 formalized the partial handover to the Palestinian Authority that began under Oslo 1.  It established Areas A, B, and C, where the PA would have a level of control.  [Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Oslo_Areas_and_barrier_projection_2005.png)'s a map.  While this agreement eventually broke down within the 20-year-rule, Israel and the PA were cooperating and doing joint things in the West Bank, and prospects for peace looked rather promising, even with difficult negotiations still to take place.  But for the first time a Palestinian state and a Jewish one side-by-side was somewhat real.  Hell, this was the first time a Palestinian quasi-government existed at all!  So 1994 was a very significant time in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  Granted, it'll be hard to talk about this here for the next several years since the context of things breaking down is pretty important, but such is life with events just beyond the 20-year-rule.

edit about the bombing:

Since writing this and responding to comments there's a lot of important stuff I didn't know that I do now about the bombing.  What makes future-Pope Francis's actions important is that the Argentinian government seems to have *deliberately* bungled the investigation.  See [here](http://www.jpost.com/International/Ex-Argentina-leader-to-face-terror-cover-up-trial).  And he seems to have repeatedly not just condemned, but called for justice.  Argentina arrested people, but released due to lack of evidence, which it seems was destroyed/concealed by officials.  See [here](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8RT-1Okf0cSP4mYEKRjcjCf-8Fg)."

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1388608145.0,"Sorry, yes, it says mineral-based but I think in terms of the traditional ones water/silicone-based it functions more like the latter. 

Mineral Essence has some foundations that come in liquid form but they don't offer samples so it can be a bit ridiculous trying to find your shade especially since they don't have a lot of brick-and-mortar locations. Meow Cosmetics has all powder foundation, an extensive shade range (a color-matching service to boot), and does offer samples! Plus as you've noticed, it's all kitty themed :) 

To apply mineral/powder foundation: I prefer using a flat top kabuki (Sigma F80 shape, but I use one by Nanshy and I'm sure any other type woould work just as well) and getting just a bit of powder on the brush (I usually use the amount of powder that is left on the lid of the jar or only dipping in a small portion of my brush). Then I pat the powder onto my face and buff it out in little circle motions. 

If you're looking like you've gotten into some flour, some possible problems may include using too much (powder foundation gives more coverage than you would expect) or having too light of a shade. As a side note, since you were kind enough to do the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder comparison, I have some idea of the amount of coverage you'd need (light to medium? your skin looks pretty nice to me!) and I definitely recommend the Purrfect Puss formula. It's my favorite out of all three and it absolutely sinks into your skin. If you do want heavy coverage though, the flawless (heaviest coverage) formula is the heaviest coverage foundation I've used barring none. "

I know it's hard to conceptualize how something can do that without being alive, but they exist because they can self replicate, and you don't need to be alive to do that.

EDIT: Let me try to use an analogy. A woman sitting at a computer is following a set of instructions which tell her to copy and paste those instructions and send them to everyone she knows, who will then do the same thing, kind of like a chain letter. The people are the cells in your body, and the instructions are the virus. The instructions are just words on a screen and aren't alive, but it is essentially replicating itself through the computer users. If people stopped paying attention to it, it will ""die.""

Historically, the people born with more aggressive behaviors were good at protecting their tribe, ensuring survival. Yeah, we live in a society now but suggesting putting these people to death is extreme.

look at this study on spiders

http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-05/10/nice-spiders-finish-last

I know we aren't spiders and we live in a civilization but it seems there is a natural element to having some people be more aggressive than others. 

""First, Pruitt made 90 spider couples from combinations of docile and aggressive spiders. Two docile spiders together make docile offspring, while aggressive couples have aggressive offspring. Mixed couples have mixed offspring. The 90 couples were given some time to build webs together in the lab before being placed out in a Tennessee wood, in different locations. For five years, 45 of the spider colonies were regularly protected from other spider species who might act as invaders, while the other 45 were left alone, in the wild.

The control webs, protected from invading spiders, were all pretty much the same in their success at lasting the five years from 2007 to 2012 regardless of whether their spiders were docile, aggressive or mixed. However, the results in the webs open to invaders were very revealing -- aggressive spiders were best as stopping other spiders from getting into their webs, but had far fewer offspring, while the docile spiders were the opposite.

At first, this looked like a win for the docile spiders, who didn't have to worry about their kids getting eaten because there were always more to replace them. However, the long game showed that the inability to protect food supplies eventually whittled down the docile colonies' security. By 2012, all of the docile colonies had been destroyed or abandoned, while three-quarters of the smaller, sturdier aggressive colonies had held out. The mixed colonies weren't great either, with only a quarter surviving.

He writes: ""Colony lineages founded by docile spiders were eight times more likely to suffer extinction, despite their superior reproductive output. Among lineages founded by purely docile or aggressive individuals, the descendants of lineages with the highest reproductive output suffered the lowest survivorship, whereas lineages founded by a mixture of docile/aggressive lacked such a trade-off. Overall, this study demonstrates how the traits of lineage progenitors and species interactions can unite to determine the fates of entire lineages.""

Since docile spiders are still around in the wild despite this, the implication is that a little bit of cooperation is best for a species wanting to survive the game of life. However, in the long-run, it's the selfish, aggressive members of spider society that (counter-intuitively) contribute the most by actually keeping the species going.""

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1388610871.0,"What action sequences are you talking about? (to me action = fighting which to me takes off the huge majority of the game once the early sections are over). Melee is the only thing that has QTE'ish elements, but even that is always the same button and I really saw that mostly about the game visualizing your time window for you (kinda if there was a visual indication of when you can parry in Dark Souls). 

And though maybe it would be nice if that was optional, to me that's totally not what I would consider the bad type of QTE (aka where you insta-die when you fail or where what the QTE does is completely different from what you are capable of in normal gameplay, as seen in things from God of War to Dragon Age). 

=&gt; In case you are talking about various other sequences (like the various ""blow away obstacles as you slide down a waterfall"" type things) to me they are still pretty damn rare (again, after the initial tutorial section is over) compared to all the fighting/traversing you do in how much time/space they take up. And again, shooting stuff that looks like this with your shotgun is something you do in regular traversing as well, it's just here that there's a timer attached to it to actually make it harder.

Which is not to say that I'd reject someone for being too tall, just as I wouldn't reject them for being short, but when the height difference is too much, it just feels weird - I always subconsciously associated height with age/maturity (both of my parents are really tall; I took after my 4'11"" grandmother), so if I'm with someone much taller than me, it makes me feel like a little kid in a weird way. Plus, there are also practical concerns: is it hard to kiss while standing up? How's everything going to line up during sex? And so on. Plus, I always just kind of assume that really tall men prefer to date women who are more proportionate to their size anyway.

* These stats as either soft or hard stats suck. I have at my disposal a better set of hard stats, and a better set of soft stats. Obviously hard stats may be more complicated at first but easily sort themselves out. Soft stats are easy to understand and easy to misconstrue. 

Another point of contention I have is that in my return I haven't so much as heard anything positive about the progression rate or moderation activity. Not to say that mods are at fault because lets be real, I was a mod I know how it works. On that note the following are my points

* Mod team needs to nut the fuck up and work together on something to prove you can to the community. I see too many examples of mods doing things without even discussing it with each other. That is pathetic and needs to stop. You moderate sperately, you make decisions together. 

* The pacing of the RP has become boring, at least to me a relative ""newcomer"". Other than the few people whom I can count on one hand who bothered to RP with me, I haven't seen anything. On top of that there is nothing that is presented as welcoming to new RPers. How am I supposed to get involved or find something enjoyable if the people who have been here are busy, and the new guys have nothing to do?

* Lastly, when this arc does finally end. With no doubt in my mind there needs to be a hard restart. I know there will be lots of bitching and moaning but there always will be so it doesn't matter. A new system of stats needs to be put in place, and a new direction of the RP needs to be decided. Currently the RP is all over the place and not in a good way. 

Final point needs no bullets. Being here a long time, being a guy, being a girl, being a shinigami, being an arrancar, being a quincy, being an adult, being a child, loving rp, loving combat, none of these things makes you special enough to cause a fuss. We, yes **WE** all need to be more mature in how we handle things. The spoiled rotten attitude is disgusting. The entitlement is embarrassing. I can understand somethings like not wanting your character to die, or wanting to feel like the main character, but you're only the main character to yourself, the RP will never revolve around you, whether you're the captain commander or a brand new quincy. This is the same out of character. I hate hearing that people demand attention, and feel like their say is some how more important. I hate the white knighting for each other. If people have a problem be mature enough to say it yourself and defend your claims. "

thekillerinstincts,relationships,1388611826.0,"&gt;What I didn't know was that the ex-boyfriend still had feelings for her and that **they somehow still didn't broke up for good - at least in his opinion**

I see a few possibilities here: 

* He's nuts and is convinced they're still together, even though she has broken up with him. He thinks you're screwing his girlfriend.

* They actually are still together and she's lying to both of you, in which case you *are* screwing his girlfriend.

* Middle ground: she tried to break up with him but made it sound like it was a break, or something similar. Or they broke up a year ago but have been on again/off again since then.

* They *are* broken up, but he has a really intense commitment to the Bro Code and considers it an absolute betrayal for you to ever be with someone he was once with.

&gt; Well I was butt naked and totally passed out. He tried to throw a iPhone with full speed at my head - at least that's what she told me. I was still too drunk to realize what was happening and that he missed me only about an inch. I didn't say a single word.

How that plays into your transmission problems, i'm not sure. If at all. If you have exposed wires to anything that are crossed, that's not good at all for the overall electrics in all of your car.

HabseligkeitDerLiebe,todayilearned,1388612891.0,"Germany is ""like the paragon of cool"" because we had a chance to write a completely new constitution in the 20th century. The constitutions of most other western nations are ancient compared to this and many of them have problems about being transferred to a modern world. The German constitution also is seen as a work in progress, making it very adaptable, although some core values in the constitution are protected from being changed. So things like the non-discrimination of homosexuals or protection of the environment (things nobody in the late 40s thought about) now are part of the constitution.

That constitution is formed by the lessons learnt from the failure of the Weimar Republic and the following NS-dictatorship. The design of the state is one that enforces democracy even without strong democratic parties. One where human dignity trumps every other right - be it a right of the state or of other persons.

And we recently have a political culture where we don't tolerate (blatant) corruption or fraud. Our last president has to defend himself in court right now because some other guy once paid a part of his hotel fees while he was in office. It's about 700€.  
And several ministers had to step down because there were scientific shortcomings in their work while gaining their doctorate.

To the things stupid or unfair:

* **Stupid and unfair**: Some of the humanitarian aspects have been stripped from the constitution. If you're a refugee in Germany you technically have right of asylum. But in the 90s this was changed in a way that the administration doesn't care about if you're persecuted in your homeland, but if you're persecuted in the land from which you came when you entered Germany. This makes is almost impossible to be granted asylum if you reached Germany by land, since all of our neighbor countries are stable democracies with rather well working justice systems.

* **Unfair**: Many wage-agreements still discriminate between East and West Germany. This is especially crazy in Berlin, where there are multiple cases of people sitting in the same office working for different wages. The new minimum wage (Yes, there was *no minimum wage* in Germany until 2014.) is the same everywhere, though.

* **Stupid**: You can't watch most music videos on YouTube from a German IP because the GEMA (sort of a musicians guild, but with very strange structures, leaving the actual musicians out of the decision making processes) couldn't find an agreement how it should be compensated by YouTube. Soon Sony Music and others jumped on the ""if they don't show their music for free, we won't either"" bandwagon. You can fix this easily by using a proxy."

hakujin214,linguistics,1388612966.0,"&gt; How about the second more advanced/difficult Chinese passage?

Just as, if not more, unintelligible to me. The problem is that many of the characters I've never seen before, and the ones I have, I don't know what grammatical role they're supposed to be playing (Chinese compounds in Japanese can take on almost any role based on the particles attached to it) nor how to parse them. The Chinese-derived readings in Japanese also come from a smattering of different Sinitic languages depending on when they characters were introduced to Japan.

You may be on to something with the kanbun idea, but I think it's a one way street. I think you'd probably have to have some knowledge of Chinese to be able to go from Japanese to Chinese. 筆談 (hitsudan, communicating in writing), is definitely possible between monolingual speakers of either language, though, but more complicated utterances are often out of reach.

Incidentally, Korean and Japanese phonetics are remarkably similar, leading to whole phrases of cognates like ３０分マッサージ無料/30 분 마사지 무료 (30-minute massage, free of charge) and 微妙三角関係/미묘한 삼각 관계 (complicated love triangle) due to them being composed entirely of Chinese (or English) loan words."

eighthgear,anime,1388613654.0,"Shogun, not Emperor. Gintama is vaguely set in the Edo period, at a time when Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Tokugawa clan, under Tokugawa Ieyasu, had established a dynastic hold over the title of shogun in the early 1600s, and Ieyasu's descendants ruled Japan until Boshin War in 1868-69.

Basically, the shogun was a political position. However, the Emperor remained a cultural position of huge importance. Making fun of the shogun is one thing, but making fun of the Emperor is akin to making fun of Japanese culture and tradition itself. It can be done, of course, but it usually isn't. Members of the Japanese Imperial family are said to be descendants of the deity [Amaterasu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaterasu), and Japanese tradition holds that the family can be traced back to Emperor Jimmu, who gained the throne in 660 BC. In reality, there is no real evidence for Jimmu, but historians can trace the imperial line back to Emperor Kinmei in the 500s AD, making the Japanese Imperial family the oldest continuous hereditary monarchy in the world. I'm not saying that Japanese people today go around thinking that the Emperor is a deity, but he is still very important in Japanese culture."

You should talk to your cardiologist about power lifting. If my experience is any indication, you can work your way up to lifting a respectable amount. You won't be setting any records, but it's certainly not out of the question. My coarctation was full, meaning the pinch closed the aorta, which means I'm on the severe part of the spectrum.

Ah, but that's the thing. With YNAB, you're actively encouraged to use a paycheck for *next* month, rather than this one. For most people, after a couple of months they get to the point where January paychecks are used for February's budget, etc. Then your budget **is** using actual money, and there's no ""expectation"" at all, only reality. Not sure whether mint has the same possibility, but for sure if it does it's not the intuitive/default setting, so most people don't use it that way. "
ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1388615102.0,"Nomads tend to bury their dead the same way the world over. They don't. When there's wood, it's proper to make a scaffold. This is activity of the living, and so it has meaning to the living alone; that is, for the dead it makes no difference for their passage to the afterlife, but no one likes the thought of trampling a relative as they move the herds. When there isn't wood, as is more common, then no scaffold is made. There's always cloth to wrap the body, and as such it is certainly an insult to not do so. Foreign cloth from the north is greatly prized for this purpose although saddle blankets or carpets from the family ger are occasionally used. Some of the tribes lay stones around the bodies, some light incense just as they leave. But the steppe consumes them all.

The sick are laid in ditches according to procedures that the shamans keep, and burned, then buried. If there are many, they are laid overlapping, in rough patterns, the point of which only the initiated know. Those who disregard the directives have been said to suffer ill luck and sickness themselves. It is hours of careful work and then cleansing, a lost day. Too many of these lost days and lost riders and tribes can be shattered, forced to disperse and break the close ties of family. In the worst of the plague years the dead have been dropped by the wayside, left in places where the burn comes every year or buried under boulders.

The caravan families, the travelers in the north, don't obey this tradition, mostly out of necessity. They bury, as is the custom in that country. Their neighbors do not appreciate the scaffolds, and barely tolerate the cairns and shrines, even the old ones, that the travelers maintain. Sickness is almost an insult - seeing the healthy and respected buried as though they were invalids, lepers, or worse is distressing and offensive to them. Maybe the caravaners are blameless in the loss of this tradition, but it is a source of friction between them and the more traditional southerners.

The spread of the plaguelands means more and more deaths have become common. The Eyeless, *arkalni,* coming up from the south kill riders in the tens and animals in thousands, and the steppe grows barren, the normal cycles of reproduction and fertilization severed; the arkalni leave no remains and their hunger never diminishes. That stony ground grows filled with thorns and rot-scented flowers, the flora of the plaguelands. Those who venture too far south die, minds shattered, bodies collapsing and rotting alive. The doomed are summarily dispatched, lest their kin too succumb to the plague. Their bodies lie where they fall. The shamans do not know how to recover their souls and so are confounded, and many tears are shared and breasts beaten at the impropriety and tragedy of being incapable to mourn the dead the proper way. To see a loved one go from health to sickness to death is bad, to have no power to ease them or save them is worse, and to exclude them from tradition is abhorrent.

In a way the funeral rights of the Imarain have become emblematic of their fate. The dead were given gifts, tea and sacred bone and prayers, laid around carefully made scaffolds of gut and wood, which in itself was a precious resource. Soft cloths, easily torn, beautiful treasures from northland weavers were tucked around every curve  of the fallen, their families given every chance to touch and lament their lost, to acknowledge death. Even those who were constrained to tents, cared for only by medicinemen and shamans for fear of their sickness, they were given careful rights and respect. The plague-beset may have as well as evaporated. Those the arkalni slay have nothing left to bury. Too many die; the shamans are fearful and secretive, the warriors anguished over their impotence, and the elders conscious of the burden they create. Solutions are not forthcoming."

Shock_Value,tabletopgamedesign,1388615741.0,"Here's something super rough and theoretical.

Have players win Victory Points by completing random goal cards (Ticket to Ride, Takenoko) The Goal cards say things like ""5 VP: Roll exactly 12"" ""1 VP: Roll higher than 1 but less than 20.""

Then have different colored dice, because they will have different probabilities on them and institute some sort of way to have players obtain dice either by point buy/dice drafting/etc.

So if, as a player, all your goal cards say like ""10 VP: Roll higher than 30"" then you would draft as many green dice as possible because the green dice are 6 sided with 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 10.

Details that need to be fleshed out:
How to obtain dice, is there a certain hard limit of the amount of dice you can have, how to get more goal cards, when the game should end, how many colors of dice and what they should do, use larger or smaller than d6, what actions a player can take each turn and a lot more I'm not even trying to think of.

There was a study - I'll look for it a bit later - where they showed groups different images of vaginas, and the groups which saw small and surgically altered labia were more likely to rate surgically altered labia as not only what society's expectation was, but also *as normal.* It's another example where statistically and medically normal people feel the need to have surgery just to feel normal, which any mental health person would tell you is bad news.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1388616652.0,"You have to realize that you're being pretty selfish. You're focusing entirely on your own feelings and so wrapped up in your head that you're knowingly neglecting your spouse.  That's fucked up, yo.

You're over 40, have a medical condition, and your doctor has told you that realistically, maintaining your current weight is the best you can hope for.  So you need to learn to accept the weight.  Most people gain some amount of weight as they age.  50 lbs isn't insubstantial, but anyone can look attractive with that much extra weight.  Are you taking care of your hair, how you dress, your skin, etc?  

I became fat as an adult for a variety of reasons (pregnancy, birth control pills, genetic predisposition). I'm in excellent health and physically active, but I'm fat.  Unlike you I could probably lose some of the weight, but I've spent my entire life watching my mother yo-yo diet and never being any happier for it - but she did gain more every time and had a harder time losing - whereas I've been ""stable"" in my fatness for about 8 years.  I'm not thrilled with my body, but I've accepted it.  The amount of food I'd have to restrict to lose weight is really significant (low metabolism) so as long as I'm healthy and focus on getting exercise and eating decently, I'm not going to make myself miserable just for my looks.  

Accepting your body is a choice.  You have to actively make that choice.  You have to fake it til you make it, too.  Pretend you feel sexy - you'll find that eventually you WILL feel sexy.  Having sex with a husband who WANTS YOU will reinforce that you ARE sexy.  Avoiding sex and wallowing in self loathing will not make you feel or be sexy.

You can make a choice here, you just have to value your relationship more than you value hating yourself.

There was a post on here a few days ago ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1tvmo6/the_motel_advertised_that_they_had_a_pool_they/)) of a motel pool that had been filled with gravel. 

The comments suggested that the reason for it is because there were new ADA laws for hotel pools. The laws require that hotels with pools have to install a wheelchair lift and have someone on duty that is trained to operate it ([source](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=667975fd-a453-41b1-9fd4-639546517bc7), [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1tvmo6/the_motel_advertised_that_they_had_a_pool_they/cebwo4r)). Because that cost is far greater than most small motels and hotels can handle, they are simply filling in their pools.

I don't have a specific question other than to ask how you feel about laws like this? It seems like it's hurting more people than it's helping, or like the people doing the suing will never actually benefit from this law. It's sad to think that when I have kids I won't be able to take them to some crappy motel and and let them swim in the crappy pool. I always had such an amazing time doing that while on vacation as a kid. 

Again, I'm not comparing what you're doing to this, but it really created a lot of ADA hate. "

[The BLS actually tracks that.](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t16.htm)

That said, 90,000 jobs of each month's job creation go to legal immigrants, to cover the more than 1 million per year we allow.

&gt; How many of these so called new jobs are part time?

[Definitely some.](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)

&gt; How do we handle the long term joblessness in America?

We need for companies to stop moving their operations out of the US.  The only way to get them to do that is to make it more profitable to operate here than elsewhere."

Other than that you don't sound selfish at all, though.  You only dated 2-3 months before marriage, though?  Makes me wonder if you're just not that compatable sexually.  It's unfortunate she uses sex as a bargaining tool - not healthy.  

If you want to stay in the relationship, learning different 'fighting' techniques is in order.  If one person has a problem and brings it up to their spouse, the other spouse shouldn't get to use that as an opportunity to air their greviances.

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1388617503.0,"Dividend has a mind share deficiency as the vast majority of people have never received a dividend. It's another concept you'd have to market. 

If your target is to primarily convince the top say 10-20% of the income earners to support this through a marketing ploy I think you'll find it insufficient. The most well off and well to do I do not think likely to be easily fooled with a trick of language. They're more likely to know what it fundamentally is and what it means. Namely everyone gets a check and someones going to pay for it with taxes. I think they're more likely to want to know who is getting taxed and who is gaining from the policy. No matter what you call it I think the right is going to call it welfare unless it strikes some fundamental desire in its structure.

My recommendation, focus on basic income as a tax credit/cut at least at first. Simplify the tax code, put money in most peoples pockets. Pay for it with targeted changes to the cost structure of government, a simplified tax code and targeted tax code changes pointed directly at very high earners. That doesn't mean the right wing politicians won't demagogue what are effectively their own rhetorical policy aims of course."

* Football, Feminism and You - This is the episode that made me realize Community was something special. The final exchange between Troy and Jeff, in which Troy tells him to be happy with where he's at, is inspiring. Crazy to think the characterizarions were already so strong by this episode - only the sixth in the series. 

* Modern Warfare - A classic not just of the series, but of television as a whole. 

* Mixology Certification - One of the most surprise-filled and emotionally dense episodes of the show. It also showcases just how strong this ensemble is. 

* Asian Population Studies - Wildly underrated, and one of the best ""normal"" episodes. The scene where Troy interrogates Andre might be the funniest in the whole series. 

* Advanced Dungeons and Dragons - An amazing hat trick of an episode. Not only did they go with a wild concept, they put a virtually unknown background character at the center of it - and made it work beautifully. This is probably Jeff's best episode as well. 

* Critical Film Studies - Abed's story about his Cougar Town experience might be the single most bizarre scene the show's ever made. Such a long monologue could have turned out horribly on most shows, but Danny Pudi's performance makes it difficult to take one's eyes off the screen. McHale completely matches him as well, and their reactions to each other's stories are realistic and hilarious in equal measure. 

* Digital Exploration of Interior Design - Britta's finest hour, with the ""Subway"" plot serving as one of Community's funniest b-stories ever. ""It's me, Britta! I'm Subway!"" 

* Pillows and Blankets - This and the previous episode are both outstanding and form a terrific story arc. It also has the best credits scene: Troy and Abed's pledge drive. 

* Basic Lupine Urology - Everything about this Law &amp; Order parody works brilliantly. Right down to the episode name. 

* Digital Estate Planning - It's easy to forget that Community's visual comedy is just as sharp as its dialogue, and the visual humor is at its arguable peak here. Giancarlo Esposito knocks his role out of the park, too. "

A decent all-around mage that you can use with Ryze would be Brand imho; he's not necessarily the strongest or easiest mage to play but his AoE is devastating and to get good at him it forces you to become proficient at landing skillshots and comboing properly because of the mechanics surrounding his passive.
Twisted Fate is both an assassin and a mage that's a very scary roamer, and getting used to him forces you to have good map awareness and teaches you how to effectively roam.

For simplicity's sake I'll refer to them by number. 1 is the leftmost, 2 is second from the left, yadda yadda.

1,3,4, and 5 were purchased online at a strap website. I forget which site as it's been a couple of years, but I believe I paid $10 per strap.

8 came with one of my weekenders

2 came from JCrew, and it's a leather strap

6 came from the same website as 1,3,4,5, but was $12 (leather again)

and finally 7, the one you asked about. It was a mistake more than anything hahaha. I bought it from Abercrombie expecting to receive a belt. Like, a full sized belt. When I got this I was taken aback, but I found that it worked as a makeshift strap. It's easier to adjust, but it looks tacky as hell because it's a bit too narrow. I'm not sure why I even included it, it's just sitting with the rest of the collection I guess.

Anyways, that's the story. If you're in the market for NATO straps at all, maybe you can be one of my first buyers for a handmade strap. I bought a shipment of Horween Chromexcel leather at the start of July last year. Since then I've made several watch straps for my Seiko, and many wallets for friends and family.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1388618998.0,"That's why I said ""most"". Just because some heroes don't have bkb piercing disables doesn't mean they need to be buffed. Yes, maybe some of them are weak, but thats an issue with the specific hero, not ""casters"" in general. Not everyone on the enemy team is going to get a bkb, and it's natural for some heroes to be strong at certain points of the game. 

Some trade versatility for other weaknesses. Viper is strong against your typical heroes that pick up bkbs, but he has no aoe or nuke. Clinkz is rather good at picking off targets, but he relies strongly on snowballing, getting a quick orchid or blink etc.

Mirana is a pretty bad example though since she's more of a caster than an autoattacker. She has no typical carry element other than having a good agility growth.

Zeus also isn't a great example since his passive actually makes him one of the best scaling heroes that rely on magic damage."
SeedsOfDoubt,Seahawks,1388619005.0,"I won't deconstruct your 'subjective' falsities, but I will try to connect the music for you...

Just because a band is from a specific city or region of the US it doesn't follow that that region has sole ownership over their music. (Edit: In fact, most of the music played in the stadium is from bands not from Seattle.) Every time the Hawks are on national TV the /r/Seahawks and /r/nfl circle jerk is always about how they only play Nivana, Soundgarden or Macklemore. I think it's good that the Seahawks are willing to go outside of Seattle and outside of 'football' music to connect with the fans.

In Seattle we have a unique connection to the team. As the 12th Man we are the only team that has **OUR** jersey retired. Something every other team is trying desperately to emulate. Think, ""Ram Rules"" or ""Terrible Towels"".

We are the only fanbase that had a specific rule instituted to penalize our team for us being too loud (five yards for excessive noise*). This penalty was actually called by the opposing QB, not the refs. 

Phish has a unique connection to it's ""Phans"" to the point that crowd participation is not only expected but encouraged. Trey even created a series of musical cues that tell the audience to do specific things. ie. If he plays the *Simpsons* theme the crowd yells, ""DOH!"" Or there is a song called *Big Ball Jam* where each band member is represented by a large ball that is passed around the crowd. Whenever the ball is in the air, that band member plays their instrument. The list goes on and on.

Most of this crowd interaction has come spontaneously from the crowd itself. As described in the video.

With all that said, I can understand how the chant feels ""wrong"" in Seattle because it is being foisted upon us. Similar to the NOISE prompting from the big screens it will either be accepted or it won't. The band being from Vermont has nothing to do with it.

As a Phish/Seahawks fan I find it to be an awesome blending of my two favorite pastimes.

Hope that helps.

However, as much as I like the new life that now exists at MW, LW is obviously the most talent-rich division. Anthony Pettis is going to have his hands full with the likes of Melendez, TJ Grant, Khabib Numagamedov and Josh Thompson. And obviously Ben Henderson is still dangerous.

The practical reality of the need for an expedient  surrender however  took precedence.

The Soviets were due to declare war on Japan, and then invade Japanese Manchuria (in what is now china) on August 9th or 10th.  The Allies had a fairly good sense of what was about to happen - the soviets destroyed the bulk of the Japanese army in china wiping out a million man army in 9 days.  Had they waited on the bombings, or had they gone for theatrics it might have put the soviets in a stronger position to gain more territory before a surrender, at  which  point we could have been looking at a north and south japan to go with north and south korea and east and west germany.

As it was the Soviet threat was far more serious than atomic bombings, the  Japanese knew they were doomed, it was a matter of just how doomed.  The question was where the borders would end up, and what structure the government would have.  Soviet successes, particularly threatening the north of the country (when virtually the whole army was in the south to resist and American invasion) would have meant losing the territorial integrity of Japan proper, rather than just rolling back territory to the pre 1870ish borders.

Make sure that you make it clear how much this bothers you, and if you trust her make sure she knows that. It's going to be important to her to know. That said you're in an equal partnered relationship, and while you can't outright forbid her from seeing this guy you can voice your opinion on the matter and hope she appreciates what you're trying to say to her. I know you've said you have no interest in meeting this guy, or hanging around with them but you should fine a way to be at peace with this if she's going to insist on continuing to spend time with him. At the end of the day, does it really matter *where* they hangout if you're not around to see how they behave? If he's still got the hots for her, as you've said then it's likely he's going to try, or has tried something already. He likely doesn't care that she has a serious boyfriend, and I'm sure his motives for spending time with her are to make her fall for him again. This is why I suggested feeling him out.

I know it's difficult to uproot your life and throw her out, based on your situation but this is exactly why I personally choose to not get involved with women who are still on speaking terms with their ex.

Avistew,sex,1388621023.0,"Honestly, almost every fetish could be abusive, because abuse is a matter of attitude and lack of respect for your partner rather than the specific fetish itself. Granted, some would do more damage than others, I guess.

To answer your specific question, you need to understand what makes a person abusive. An abusive person wants to actually hurt you, or doesn't care whether they hurt you or not.

Your boyfriend has a fetish that involves blood. It's not something he picked, and it's unfortunate as it's not the most practical fetish to have happen. However, instead of actually hurting you, he uses his imagination and pretends your period blood is something else.

That's not abusive. An abusive person would want to actually hurt you. They would want you to be in pain. Faking it would do nothing for them. Your boyfriend has a fetish that is not his reality. He doesn't want to actually hurt you, but the concept is hot to him. That's why period blood does it for him. Because he can pretend.

I don't know your boyfriend, and it's always difficult to predict who might be abusive or not. And I would never want to give someone a 100% guarantee. But I see good signs here, not bad ones. I see him finding harmless ways to work his fetish rather than harmful ones.

If he ever actually hurts you, that's the warning sign. If he ever seems not to care about your opinion or consent, that's the warning sign. As long as he makes sure you're on board, then he's not abusive, he has a fetish for fake abuse.

Do you have a safe word? I would suggest picking one. You can also use the ""yellow"" and ""red"" method (yellow means slow down, red means stop). The reason here is that if he likes the fantasy of hurting you, and if you are comfortable with it, you could roleplay more, with you going ""no"" or struggling, etc. But if you go that road, it's important that he always knows when you're struggling or saying no for show, or when you're doing/saying it for real. A safeword serves that purpose. Any other words, even ""no"", actually means ""yes"".

Anyway, the way you phrased your post, it's not clear if he's into blood specifically, or if it's just a ""side-effect"" for him. Guys being fine with having sex during a period are not as rare as a lot of people seem to think. If you're able to have sex during that time (some women aren't because of the pain) and want to, and he wants to, then have fun! Lots of people don't get to, so enjoy :)"

I'm sorry, how does your second paragraph counter what I said? It has nothing to do with what I wrote. If Gleason is more suited for a game, then he should play over Rielly. Carlyle's job isn't to play the fan favourite prospect, it's winning games. If they need a stay at home presence he should be put in the lineup over Rielly. Fraser being bad this year doesn't mean all stay at home defensemen are, lets see what Gleason can do before you assume that Rielly is better. 

Gleason isn't a square peg, physical stay at home defensive defenseman is exactly what Carlyle likes on the back end. Using offensive skating defenseman in Carlyle's system is square peg round hole. "

Accidents happen, but keeping yourself out there for potential employers to find (and doing regular job searches for what you do in and around areas you live or want to live) would be my takeaway here.  Healthcare and legal companies have historically been the worst (and cheapest, in salary outlay to IT employees) places I've worked and consulted for in the past, and I believe that view would probably be shared by a few here as well.

It was a mess).

That night a really hot guy started chatting with me.  I neglected to mention that I had a live in boyfriend.  We spent hours talking and flirting.  At the end of the night he offered to walk me home.  I came clean about being in a relationship then, but he said he still wanted to walk me home.  

Outside my apartment, he kissed me, and I felt something I hadn't felt in years.  That's all that happened.  And despite that I felt so guilty - despite the fact that my ex had supposedly broken up with me hours before - that I wanted to throw up.  Yet honestly, experiencing that was the catalyst to getting out of that relationship.  Just realizing that interesting, attractive men could want me was a huge breakthrough after years of feeling hideous and unwanted.

It could be a stretch. I'm not too sure.

How to stop falling for guys like this? You should spend time alone, out of a relationship. Your goal should be to find out who you are alone. Get to the root of it, as I said in my initial response. You and I can speculate until we're blue in the face, but only the real answer will get you anywhere. 

I'm attracted to girls who have a nurturing nature. I tend to get with a girl on the basis that I have no plans to break up with them unless they're a whack job. I'm not saying I hear wedding bells, or even think of marriage when I get with a girl but I'm always thinking long term, and how she will benefit me. **If** I should stay with this woman, is she going to be a good mother to my children?

His biggest strength is that he is not afraid to stick with the game plan even though it's not working right away. I know that sounds contradictory to what everyone else is saying, but I'm talking about something a little different. He doesn't abandon the run because it's only gaining short yardage. His offense is a 'rope-a-dope' style. He will lull you to sleep then hit you with a big play when you try to stack the box.

They also can't have either of them fight JDS because he'll probably beat them and take their credibility as a challenger to Cain away.

Maybe they could start to push Overeem again if he manages a big win over Mir. Maybe Werdum-Overeem III?

ed8020,AskReddit,1388624081.0,"The single most important piece of information I can give is this.

[Desiderata](http://www.desiderata.com/desiderata-poem.html). Latin for desired things

I discovered it on a poster when I was 12 or 13 and it has been a true guide for me. Learn it, understand it. And don't be misguided by thinking this is something ""religious"". I'm a 51 year old atheist and have no problem with the line, ""Therefore, be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be."" The important part is that you are ""at peace with"" WHATEVER you conceive him to be. And don't be afraid to admit that you just don't know.

The next thing would be, [The Litany Against Fear](http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Litany_Against_Fear).
If you remember nothing else remember, ""Fear is the mind killer"". I know it may sound corny but it has real world applications. Courage is the ability to act rationally in the face of fear.

Next, society really doesn't start to treat you like a real adult until you're about 25. That's just the way it is. So, enjoy this time being a kid. Don't try to grow up too fast. It happens when it happens.

And two last things, one from my father, ""If a man's word is no good, he is no good"". This doesn't mean you ALWAYS live up to your word, shit happens. But it does mean that you make every effort to live up to it. Which leads into part two, from me. ""Own your mistakes, or they will own you."" If you make a mistake, it's a hell of a lot better if YOU point it out than someone else. Being wrong isn't nearly as bad as not being able to admit it. It will immediately negate half of the arguments you could have had in your life.

Wow. That got much longer than I expected."

Awkward_moments,AskReddit,1388626564.0,"Quotes are a weird thing. Some of them are down to interpretation more than anything. I didnt make this list because I wanted to be told what I should think, or how I should act. I did it because ultimately I wanted to find my own philosophy, I used the quotes as a tool to help bring what I believe into a more attainable medium. I realised that largely my motivation comes from wanting to be a better person. I have a (blurry) image in my head of perfect guy. And my motivation comes from trying to become that person. (The image is reasonable btw, its not like always spend time working. More like be a dick to your friends but always be there to help them.) So I figured wiser men than me have said it better, and therefore I look at the quotes as guide or teacher. If I wrote a diary I could figure out what I believe but it would be poorly written and take a while to think about if I came back to it. With this list I can be sitting at my desk staring at my work and think ""Why am I doing this? Im sad."" But by looking at a few quotes it will remind me why. Also I tried organising them, but to no success.

“The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company...a church....a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude...I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you...we are in charge of our attitudes.”

Unicornrows,confessions,1388626846.0,"Here's my take on this: Humans evolved towards reproduction, and have powerful emotions that drive us towards certain things, make us desire them, and make us feel good if we get them. Sugar is one of those things. It is a good calorie source so our animal brains find it pleasing. But if you eat too much, it can become detrimental. Your emotions aren't rational enough to make it taste bad, even if you have diabetes.

Sexual attraction is the same type of thing. Guys are generally attracted to healthy young women because those women, on average, can make the most and the healthiest babies. We also get emotionally attracted to people who we think have compatible personalities because that is a good relationship in which to have kids. You are subconsciously emotionally drawn to her in a way you wouldn't be if she was 90 years old, even if she had the same personality. You would be happy to keep it on a platonic level.

Since you have kids already with your wife, it is possible that you subconsciously are driven to move on. Your emotions are designed for your reproduction, not necessarily for marriage. There are good arguments to be made for the idea that people are wired to mate and pairbond for a few years while they raise a kid, and then move on to the next person. Of course, there is no one correct way to be.

So it makes some sense that you would be attracted to other girls. It's your reproduction drive. But the fact that you're fixated on this one is probably because she shares personality traits with your best friend (someone you get along with), and that you have gotten to know her well, through purely social interactions at relaxing get-togethers. You could have the same desire and the same connection, if not better, with a different girl. You just probably rarely get to know any other young women very well.

If you pursue this girl, especially if she turns you down, you may lose your best friend and damage your reputation with other people also. I think you should look at your marriage and whether you want to stay in it, but also realize that you have tunnel vision for this girl because you probably know very few others."

It's a common negative stereotype for Asian men (I don't even see how its fair to apply it anyway to some Asian countries, as many still suffer from high malnutrition rates).

Also if the OP is Chinese-American the statement would be inaccurate as well as Asian-Americans have undoubtedly a higher average height then people from their parents' homeland back in Asia. It would be comparable to comparing a modern Dutchman's height to the average height of a Dutchman pre-WW2 (which was barely 5'6). Plus China has huge regional differences in height, especially from North to South. Average height of a Northern Chinese (+South Korean) young adult is probably similar to many European countries. Remember how many western press outlets were so flabbergasted that the police officers seen escorting Bo Xilai (who himself is 6'1) were so tall? The court was in Shandong province which is known in China for having very tall people. Though the OP didn't actually specify what his height is so I can't comment further."

They were acting in keeping with the church's doctrine, if the church's behavior is any indicator.  Also gotta love that you immediately knew that was coming, because you knew that religions do shit like that.

Also I like how you're using a site specific definition for cult rather than something more encompassing and less specific.

&gt;cessation of scholastic activities, estrangement from family, disinterest in society

Yea I bet all those famous Scientologist celebrities are so in keeping with this...oh wait...no they're not.  They continue to perform their jobs, they live with their families (see the Cruises, who were together as scientologists) and they continue to interract with society.  

&gt;in an opinion by Benjamin Zablocki

So not a scientific study with actual data to back it up then.  Or any means of defining how cults operate in an official and verifiable way.  Meaning it's useless for the actual definition on whether or not Scientology is a cult any more than any other religion.

Also you want to talk cults?  How about Mormonism, which results in behavioral changes, loss of identity, cessation of certain scholastic activities, estrangement from non-mormon families (by church mandate) disinterest in society (considering the requirements of the church that aren't in keeping with normal social etiquette), and the like.  

Or fundamental islam, which also has all of the qualities John Gordon Clark mentioned.  Particularly on women.  Yet it also is a religion.

Leads me to think your definition of cult is a little inaccurate if you're planning on using it to differentiate it from a religion."

caseyls,Android,1388627670.0,"People put Touchwiz up against Stock Android. I'm not sure how long you've been using Android, so I'll give you a little history.

Back in the days of Froyo-Gingerbread, Android was ugly. There was no design, no direction for anything, it was terrible looking.

All the OS skins looked pretty bad too; everything was all gradient covered, half skeuomorphic, half flat, and just had generally terrible looking OS elements.

Then came along Android 4.0. Matias Duarte came in and gave Android an absolutely beautiful remake. There was an obvious direction in the design. You could see where it was going, and it was going to be good.

Then HTC redid their skin for the new version of Android, and it looked pretty good too. They brought in some nice condensed fonts and animations, and it wasn't too bloated anymore.

Then Samsung released their new Nature-UX ""redesign"". And it hadn't changed. Well, it had, but half of the elements still looked like they were from the froyo-gingerbread area, with gradients on their buttons, a completely disjointed design (no 2 apps look the same or use similar design) and was overall bloated and laggy. ~~Like someone else said, a freshly booted Note 3, with 3 gigs of ram, has 900mb when it starts.~~ Apparently this isn't true, but my statement still stands. While other OS skins have lightened up over the years, Touchwiz is still slower to open apps and has studdery scrolling.

So people think touchwiz is ugly because, while other manufacturers have moved their designs forward into a new era, Samsung still seems to be stuck in the past."

In the public's eyes, the elderly aren't useful, they aren't cute, they don't have value, and they are terrifying - we are all going to grow old and get sick, we are all going to die, and in this country, we are in denial of that. They are an uncomfortable truth and there is so little support for a community that needs just as much help and support as any other dependent populations. Public geriatric care agencies are understaffed and underfunded, making foster care look like Angelina Jolie does their fundraising. In many parts of the country *geriatric care agencies don't even exist*. Private agencies also struggle. Like all caseworkers, I struggled in foster care, and my job was challenging because my clients were all older (12-almost 21). I was friends with a geriatric caseworker (we worked on a case together), and I got to see how hard it was for her and her clients. There was nursing home negligence/outright malpractice. There were clients being victimized by family, neglected and abused because their social security check was all that mattered. Elder care providers were doing the same thing, and getting paid by naive family members to do it! And it was 100x harder for her to rescue her clients than it was for me to help mine. *No one cared*. CPS is backed by a judicial system that is overwhelmed for sure, but at its core does not tolerate abuse and neglect of children. The geriatric wing of social services is not that lucky.

And then there is the sad truth that working with the geriatric population is sad and heartbreaking. When I worked on the case that involved an adolescent and his elderly (adoptive) mother, it was heartbreaking. I was helping my client have a brighter future. His mother was declining, rapidly. The outcome was very different. That really wears on you."

firematt422,KansasCityChiefs,1388628589.0,"The fact is, ALex Smith is conservative. For better or worse, that's what it is and that's what the team has to work with. 

That being said, offensively there are two keys: pass protection and creating gaps in coverage.

None of our receivers, with the possible exception of Jamaal Charles on screens can get any distance between them and their coverage on a consistent basis. Also, Eric Fisher is not working out as well as we would've hoped and the rest of the O-line isn't doing much better.

This brings me to a conclusion. I don't think our receivers are capable of the sort of dependability needed for the playoffs. I just don't. 

What I would like to see is a return to Chiefs basics. Running. Andy Reid loves to throw, so we haven't seen much running attack this year. I think a good playoff strategy is to bring the run back into full swing. The Colts are going to spend the week preparing to stop screen passes. This could provide a lot of opportunity for the O-line to step it up and create gaps down the middle for a run if we can make it look like we're setting up a screen play and coax Indy's LBs to the outsides. 

TL;DR: Play-action, fake the screen, send Jamaal up the middle or off tackle. Send a few to Bowe to keep them honest, and return to the proven success of the screen if the Colts start stuffing the middle. "

If he's relatively intelligent, I would advise against force-feeding him all this as he might think you're talking bubbles solely to boost his ego. Throw it into a conversation here and there.

Why do they now want to burn me at the stake?  Is it because I'm Polish, or what?

Also; if Austria is just naturally going to hate me; who should I turn to that is close by as an ally?  Muscovy, Bohemia, Sweden, and Hungary hate me (although Hungary is honestly my fault), and the Ottomans just now declared war on Hungary and I'm afraid they're going to go a bit too conquest happy.

There are only ever 2 challengers, a Republican and a Democrat; however, this does not negate the almost certain third party candidate. It's trickier for Congressional seats, because typically third party candidates are just outspent by massive margins and drop out, but that doesn't mean they can't still be written in.

TheDissoluteCity,AdviceAnimals,1388630400.0,"That's an admirable attitude to have, but I don't know the context from which you're speaking it, nor is it fair for you to assume that your own context can be universalized. Obviously there are cases where an offer of help would be insulting, but certainly there are other cases where an offer of help is a moral obligation, right?

Let's take, for analogy, two extremes on this spectrum. In one case, you are walking along the sidewalk when you slip on a banana peel and skin your knee. As you're getting up and dusting yourself off, I rush over and loudly proclaim my concern for you, offering to help you in whatever way I can, and admiring your tenacity in overcoming adversity. Clearly I'm being pretentious, and you'd be right to tell me to piss off. You were fine on your own, and whatever aid I'm offering you is patronizing and likely self-serving.

On the other hand, you're walking along the sidewalk when six dudes jump out from behind the bushes with baseball bats and beat you to within an inch of your life. I'm passing by just afterwards and offer you a ride to the hospital and, because the thugs took your wallet, to put a down payment on your treatment (let's pretend for the sake of the analogy that medical care works like that). Am I still just trying to feel good about myself? Should you tell me to piss of? declare that you'll surely stabilize your vital functions and stagger to the hospital all by yourself, thank you very much? Would I be justified if I just walked right on by despite your very evident suffering? Now let's say the thugs were my cousins, and that they beat you for reasons that had been legally and socially acceptable until very recently.

Anyways, somewhere on this spectrum lies enslaving a people for 200+ years and treating them as second-class citizens for another century afterwards. I'm inclined to believe that it's nearer to the second example than to the first, and that, therefore, some real collective obligations exist. It's a bit disingenuous to foist the ""bootstrap"" ethic onto a group of people that has been cast into conditions that *most* couldn't possibly escape. "

Dynablayde,MensRights,1388630472.0,"It's pretty hard to say endemic when you're looking though a microscope at specific events rather than the whole.

As far as I'm concerned, it just shows the problem with using meaningless titles/labels to define ones identity. Gamer has about as much meaning as nerd or geek in today's culture, a vague definition that seems to change from person to person, group to group, but lack any form of consistency. 

It also begs the question, what labels do you draw the line at for ""needing to die"" or rather, hating the culture surrounding the label? A huge number of 'gamers' also identify as 'nerd' or 'journalist' or 'employer' so which one takes precedence? Clearly the answer is the ones that the speaker is most disenfranchised with at any given time, but that's hardly good enough.

If you can replace any instance of gamer with nerd, journalist or employer and it has the same meaning then it shows that the ""problem"" (assuming there is one) isn't with 'gamers' so much as people in general."

Caveat: You shouldn't ignore women though, and you shouldn't restrict yourself to only dating ""super duper wonderful women"". Dating, like all things, improves with experience.

HellbillyDeluxe,Christianity,1388630670.0,"No not at all satisfactory as definitive proof, at best your examples are circumstantial evidence from accounts long after the event. It would not be indisputable if there were craft marks and messages before and after an alien encounter because it could still be a hoax, much like crop circles. People can be convinced of anything,false prophets arise all the time and amass large followings, again just because Paul or James genuinely believed thee y had saw Christ and convinced others is not proof of anything. Because a writer two hundred years after his death did not question whether Christ was real is not proof of anything about his actual existence or not. Not to mention the histories you speak of were decades after the fact, and historians from that time are widely unreliable. Plato wrote of Atlantis in his histories but it is not proof it existed. Also your suggestion as to The Younger's belief that Christ was another type of being is wholly based on your subjective opinion, he merely stated how people who worshiped ""Christ as to a god"" acted, not that he saw him and thought him to be other worldly, as well he lived after christ.  I can state that the people of North Korea worship their dictator as a god, it does not mean I think he is one or whether he or she is a god. I think your standard of ""proof"" needs to be revised, relying on second hand accounts from centuries after the event, and translated innumerable times may be enough for you but it is not for me. One does not have to believe in a historical Christ to do good works and be inspired by the Bible or by the Church. Literalism is one step away from Fanaticism in my opinion, especially when so much of it contradicts reason and observable phenomenon.

You're talking about the former, and OP may be correct to suggest that they're espoused by minorities in the United States more often than the white majority these days. But I'm suggesting that those ""prejudicial feelings"" can be partly explained with reference to ""structural racism,"" which is a much more deeply rooted set of conditions that, independently of anyone's feelings about people of another race, nevertheless tends to privilege members of one race over another. E.g. Shawna might be partly forgiven for feeling prejudiced when she notices that she and all her impoverished friends, who happen to be black, live in one slummy part of Chicago, while Taelynn and all her Prada-sporting friends, who happen to be white, live in a gated community on the other side of town. Taelynn probably isn't prejudiced (or, more likely, she never has to think about race), while Shawna is, but Taelynn is benefiting from structural racism, while Shawna is suffering from it. I.e. you can explain their respective situations in part by reference to the history of race relations in the United States (slavery, segregation, et al.)."

Seattlelite84,WritingPrompts,1388631910.0,"I stopped running. Chest heaving, I sank to my knees, the binoculars slipped from my numb fingers. 


For three months and seven days I've followed him. Watching. When I first saw him, I thought I was losing my mind; after all, it had been nearly five years since I'd seen another human being. The mind, as they say, unravels. God knows I've had some... 'episodes' in the last half decade.


So when I heard the sound, the sound of a human voice in the distance, I thought I'd lost it. It took me several moments to talk myself down to merely being delusional. But the voice didn't stop. It was singing. Husky, horribly off-key singing, at the top of his lungs. Dropping the can of cold beans I'd been half-heartedly munching on to the dirt, I launched to my feet and ran toward the sound.


Coming to the top of the hill, catching sight of him, I couldn't say (even now) what kept me from calling out. Everything in me was bursting with excitement at the unbelievable, impossible thought of actually talking to another person. But some instinct held my tongue. I dropped to a knee and hunkered behind a tree. I watched for a moment as I caught my breath.


I had never seen one man carrying so many firearms. He bristled like a low caliber porcupine. And then the song came to purpose. A cat broke cover beneath a car and tore down the street. In a flash, the man had raised on of his guns and opened fire. I couldn't tell if he hit it, but given how many bullets he blew down the street, I got the feeling by the time he stopped shooting he'd forgotten about his target. And then he laughed.


I had missed laughter, more than I could say. If I missed one thing the most—beside the sense of physical contact—it was laughter. The rich sound of an outpouring of joy. This, was not that. The sound of his laugh set my teeth on edge. Something was all wrong about it, and I knew in that moment, this man had cracked. And he was not coming back. And he was frighteningly well armed.


And yet, how could I turn away? The only things that lived and breathed I'd seen in five years went on four legs. The only other human being that, as far as I knew, still alive, was a fucking nutjob.


Before I'd really thought everything through, I was back at my makeshift camp, stuffing my few scattered possessions into my pack and loading up on my bicycle. I had to keep a line of sight on him, whatever else came, I'd figure that out later. But I absolutely, under no circumstances could lose track of him.


Months went by, and I watched him nearly every day. I disabused myself any hope of approach within the first week. He was erratic, emotionally unstable, liable to unleash a hail of lead at any imagined provocation and without the slightest warning. Often as not he would break from his raucous singing to fly into a rage, grabbing up some random trash or stones to smash in a window, then fall to his knees weeping and screaming. Even this behavior I might of overcome, but not once did I hear him speak a word of English. Nor any other language I recognized. What he vocalized was no actual syntax, but a guttural expression of emotion in sound.


Nevertheless, he gave me a more solid sense of sanity than I had known in years. I came to discover almost a parental sense of watching over this man: the last kin I had in entire world. I came to know him. His erratic instabilities began to form patterns. He would hunt in the mornings, eating his fill of whatever he killed (often without even the attempt of cooking it) and stuff the rest of the carcass into a bag for the day's meal. The one exception in his penchant to shoot and kill everything that moved was birds. When he heard the song of a bird, any bird, even crows, he would drop whatever he was doing and follow the sound. When he found them he would sink to his haunches and listen, spittle dripping down his chin. He loved denim. Every time we—and I soon began to think of us as we—passed through a town that hadn't burned to the ground, if he happened to pass a clothing store he would wander in and come out with a new jean jacket. He didn't seem to care how new the one he currently wore was, he'd always come out with a new one.


The one thing that really made me question my decision to give him this berth, to maintain this orbit around him, was song. Once in a great while, he would hum the slow, sad notes of Greensleeves. It was the one recognizable piece of human culture that he seemed truly cognizant of.


Not that it matters now. I don't know what set him off. Maybe it was just being alone. Maybe the certain of complete despair settled down on him on some odd moment of lucidity. I don't know. All I know is that one moment I was eating a sandwich, laying on my belly in the warm grass on the hill above his 'camp' and watching him through my binoculars. The next he had stood up, his face upturned to the sun. I could barely make out the strains of Greensleeves rising up to me. Then he pulled a gun out of his pocket, raised it to his head, and blew his brains out.


And now I'm alone. And all I have are these notes, these guns, and the cold body of my last connection to a reason for living."

ChrisVolkoff,AskMen,1388631926.0,"&gt; Do everything that deep down inside YOU want to do, not necessarily strictly career-wise, but genuine passions you haven't really gotten around to

After a ""recent"" breakup, I realized that I need to find myself, I need to become the man I've always wanted to me. And *then* comes a relationship.

My big dream/plan right now is to study abroad in [New Zealand](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/search?q=new+zealand&amp;restrict_sr=on) (or Australia; still haven't decided) in 2-3 years. This is really big for me, because I'm very, very shy. I find it hard to approach people, to go up to people and talk to them. Being in a new country where I don't know anyone and would need to start from scratch would be a real challenge for me. Putting myself in an unknown place and in a vulnerable situation is my ultimate challenge. I really think it would be an amazing life experience.

However, even though I want to do it, I know that I really need to push myself, because otherwise I'll just end up dropping the dream. I read somewhere that you should share your plans and dreams with people around you, because they'll remind you of your own dreams. They'll push you in the right direction. And perhaps that's why I'm sharing this now..! If you - or anyone - have any tips, I would appreciate it.

I'm slowly working toward that goal. Studying abroad is the ultimate challenge. It represents everything I want to overcome and the person I want to become.

And then I think I'll be happy with myself. *That*'s what I need, because right now I'm in no condition to be in a (healthy) relationship."

briannasaurusrex92,WTF,1388632231.0,"It's not so bad. I had to take the valium/laughing gas for mine on Friday due to insurance not wanting to pay to knock me out. The top two, which were unerupted but vertical, were as simple as accessing the tooth through the gum and pulling. The bottom two were partially erupted but horizontal (occurs in less than 3% of cases, lucky me) and he did have to go in through the side and drill them into pieces before removing them. But I was just today able to get my tongue back there and explore the sites gently, and  I don't think I have any pieces remaining or anything, I think it's going to be okay.

And I was awake for the whole thing, perfectly conscious of what exactly they were doing in my mouth, and telling the assistant she was lucky I didn't have a gag reflex (yes, I am female, you may draw your own conclusions), so it's not some kind of crazy traumatic thing.

Do, however, have someone pick you up and go get ALL your pain prescriptions right away. They gave me two different kinds, and we got just one and I was dropped off at home because errands. Well, turns out that demerol does absolutely nothing for me, so I had to wait for about two hours crying like a baby until the vicodin could be picked up. That was fun."

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1388633587.0,"&gt;I'm sure it got its share of headlines back then, but I think it really dropped off the radar after that, and I think it's too important--and instructive--to have been so ignored. Thanks for mentioning it here.

Eh...honestly most events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have dropped off the radar among American Jews, except for generalities.  I've met very few American Jews who could name a particular Second Intifada bombing, or have heard of the Coastal Road Massacre, etc.  It was overshadowed by another far-right act of violence soon after, the assassination or Rabin in '95.

&gt;In particular, I am curious as to how this event can tell us something about the far right in Israel. How influential was it in 1994? And in the years leading up to it?

Well, because they were banned exact election results don't exist for most of their existence.  They maxed out at one MK, with roughly 25,000 votes.  But election polling just prior to the ban indicates they may've had 100,000 voters or more for 3~4 seats in Knesset.  Some sources say as many as a dozen seats, but the ones online are tremendously biased.  So not a huge segment of Israeli society, but definitely a noticeable one.

&gt;How is it that this kind of mass murder led to only a slight marginalization of the far right?

Well, Rabin's assassination had a lot more to do with it.  But keep in mind that the underlying reasons for the far-right movement still existed.  People still didn't want to give up the territories, still viewed the Palestinians as violent, etc.  And many saw the massacre as revenge for the killing of Israeli civilians during the first intifada, or at least thought that that situation meant it could be ignored.  At a time when the government had just given away land, far-right ideas still had a lot of appeal.  But the movement was weakened.  Of course, the right-wing in general won the next elections, but even they proceeded with negotiations.  It's also relevant that those who defend the massacre have a bizarre notion that it was to head off some sort of impending Palestinian attack.  While an impending attack isn't impossible (or even unlikely), the notion that killing a bunch of worshipers would've stopped it is moronic.  And the massacre triggered a wave of rioting anyway.

&gt;What kind of rhetoric was there about this event in public fora and in the news? How did people understand the event?

Mostly, as the actions of a nut.  See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_massacre#Israeli_public) for a summary.  While the far-right venerated him, most people didn't.  And this helped push the farthest of the mainstream right-wing back into a less radical position."

AkiraZXE,DaystromInstitute,1388633888.0,"I'd never be allowed to be a Starfleet captain because I wouldn't swear an oath that involved upholding the Prime Directive, as I believe it's a bunch of cowardly garbage to protect the oh-so-delicate Federation from needing to make difficult decisions. That aside...

Without a more detailed scenario, I can't say exactly what I'd do, but I'd definitely interfere somehow. The easiest solution would be to transplant the bird species to another planet, ideally one where an intelligent species isn't about to hunt them down. This is only possible if there's a relatively suitable planet nearby, and the ship is large enough to carry them. Another solution might be to give them some advantage they currently don't have, something that allows them to survive, if not thrive, in the changed environment. Direct interference is also possible but not ideal.

There are all sorts of options available. Like I said before though, the amount of detail you'd need to put into this scenario in order for a serious plan to come about would be an absurd amount of work for what I think is supposed to be a way to get some insight on how people truly perceive the Prime Directive.

Here's the way I see it: A potentially intelligent species is in danger due to the actions of another intelligent species, and these actions are not required (from the sound of your description) for their survival. It's not obvious *how* one should help, but it is that they should. They may want to ask for help and just don't know we're right there. There's a whole notion that it's ""playing god"" to interfere. Except, from what I've seen, if there are gods, they rarely interfere. They may start things and let nature take its course, but by sitting above the clouds, merely watching and waiting, assured that we are too high above them for it to matter to us, isn't *that* playing god? If you're worried about causing something you didn't intend or running into hard issues, you should never have left your planet in the first place."

Dr_Explosion,AskReddit,1388634455.0,"After the Phantom Menace came out, I was falling out of love with Star Wars. My passion was fading and I just couldn't care about the universe or characters anymore. I bought KoTOR purely because BioWare was making it and because it was a sci-fi RPG (a rare thing as far as I knew). Not only did I end up blazing through it in less than a week, but my love of Star Wars was re-ignited.

Sometime last year, I finally gave up on Star Wars. All the hate for the prequels, (they aren't as good as the originals but I still enjoyed AoTC and RoTS), all the terrible E.U. novels I had wasted money on, all the hate for George's tinkering, my favourite E.U. character going dark side, all the hate for practically everything, just drained me. 

But a few weeks ago, my craving for a sci-fi RPG lead me to installing KoTOR 1&amp;2. My progress on KoTOR stalled when I realized I couldn't play the type of character I wanted, however I'm a Star Wars fan once more."

&gt; http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/12/the-ambition-myth-debunking-a-common-excuse-for-the-gender-wage-gap/265744/

Let me quote this article for you:

* Career and family choices aren't the only thing holding back women's earnings. Recent research shows that **there is bias**, too ... even if we're uncomfortable to call it out.

* When researchers have studied the ambition gap, they've discovered something peculiar: **It's not there**. Women do ask for more. They just aren't rewarded for it.

* The research organization Catalyst, for example, found that among MBA grads on a traditional career track, **women are even more likely than men** to seek out skill-building experiences and training opportunities and to make their achievements visible by asking for feedback and promotions. Women also reported 8*similar rates of negotiating as me**n: 47 percent of women and 52 percent of men had asked for a higher salary during the hiring process, and 14 percent of women and 15 percent of men had asked for a higher position. No gap there.

* A recent paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research reported similar findings. When it was not made explicit that prospective employees could negotiate salary, men were more likely than women to haggle anyway. **But once it was made explicit, women drove an even harder bargain than men.**

* If women are less ambitious, we'd expect them to be about equally satisfied with their careers as their male colleagues. But Catalyst found that men at all levels are more satisfied with their careers than women. Thirty-seven percent of men were very satisfied, compared to just 30 percent of women. The only place where men and women were equally dissatisfied was at the lowest rungs of a firm.

For fuck's sake, here's a bolded heading directly from the article:

###SAME AMBITION, LESS PAY

* http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/05/the-biggest-myth-about-the-gender-wage-gap/276367/

That article in general claims that it's an ""ambition gap"" problem (as debunked in the article **you** linked above), but it also says this:

* It is only as careers advance, they found, that men outpaced female earnings as they made their way toward the executive suite. 

But let's just sweep *that* part under the rug.

One day you don't wear make up, features that I've never seen on you are there, maybe you face looks an entirely different shape, you're a different colour. *To me*, usually, there's no explanation as to why you would look so different. ""Oh, she's not wearing make up today"" is not something I think of, being a guy who never wears make up. (Though, admittedly, I am a little more aware of it than I used to be).  

Stop and think for a moment, what would be a reasonable explanation for someone's face changing over night, aside from a) being sick today and b) not wearing make up today? 

It probably sounds like I'm having a go at you, but it just feels like people never take the time to look at it from the other point of view. I'm not saying ""Are you sick?"" because you look less attractive than normal. It's because you look different to normal, and I am lost.

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1388635612.0,"&gt;In ancient, classical, medieval, renaissance, and even early modern times you had large scale war, usurping, revolutions, rise and fall of empires, ""great men"" like Alexander and Genghis Khan.

These happened over millennia.  You're likely compressing all of antiquity into a much shorter amount of mental time than is the case.  Some metrics to illustrate:

1. More time had elapsed between the construction of the Sphinx and Cleopatra than between Cleopatra and now
* More time elapsed between Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan than between Genghis Khan and now
* The Roman Empire rose and fell over a longer period than between the Crusades and now, and that's counting the fall when the Western Empire collapsed.  Between the beginning and the fall of Byzantium and the death of the last Roman Emperor, it's the amount of time elapsed from the transition of Rome to an Empire from a Republic and now (i.e. Rome existed as a Republic for as long as there hasn't been any Roman Empire).

Those ""great men"" you mention lived over a thousand years apart.  You've put ""the past"" into one time period, it seems.

And as others have said, your definition of ""interesting"" is quite subjective.  You seem to be talking about time since the Cold War being boring.  That's roughly 20-years, and is outside the scope of this subreddit.  Julius Caesar was active in politics for longer than that.  Numerous interesting political and military events have taken place sense then--it seems you just don't care about them."

I have to say, I'm slowly falling into that trap, so that's why I want to do a 180° before it's ""too late."" Or at least a 1°, because you have to start somewhere, right?

That's a good point. I'm afraid of what people could think of me; I'm afraid of looking like a fool. So I'm simply afraid of trying or doing anything. But, yes, our generation is like that. We were taught to fit in, to try to be a part of a group. While this is good, you have to be *yourself*, too. But we're all different..

This is were your next point comes in handy. I like how you explained it, because, what am I doing right now? Nothing. If I don't even try to provoke anything in my life, nothing will ever happen. I certainly did notice that people notice me, even if I try to hide things. And that's not really how and for what I want people to know be for.

I also think it forces you to [get out of your comfort zone](http://i.imgur.com/Ga3WX4Q.jpg). That's something you absolutely need to do in order to move forward in life.

k1ngm1nu5,AskReddit,1388635890.0,"For me, there's three categories: indie, AAA and oldie. 

Best indie game? Gameplay-wise, Minecraft without a doubt. But I feel like Little Inferno is better, all things considered. Beautiful art, runs fucking *anything*, and has a great, original and meaningful storyline, and on top of all that, the premise is very original and entertaining.

Best AAA title? Either the BioShock games or Portal/Portal 2. Bioshock has a damn good storyline, some of the best atmosphere of any game, and substantial meaning in it. Portal has a hilariously entertaining storyline, simple and elegant gameplay, and with portal 2, great multiplayer. Dunno which one is better, but given the fact that bioshock has had a much bigger impact in my life, I will choose it as best AAA.

Best oldie. This is an easy choice for me, and while other people may never even heard of this game, it has a lot of sentimental value to me. Railroad tycoon II. My dad showed me that game, and it was one of the last games me and him played together. "

I had a friend who got pregnant while married. The pregnancy was not planned but she and her husband could've afforded to do it. He was very happy at the prospect.

She, however, who never wanted kids, got more and more depressed. She started actively feeling suicidal. She kept hoping she'd fall at work and miscarry. 

Finally, she begged her husband to allow her to abort because it was driving her literally crazy. They did, and she survived. I don't think she would have if she'd gotten more than a month or two pregnant. "

Constam,gaming,1388636192.0,"Compared to some games, sure. But how about Battlefield vs Call of Duty? Obviously, CoD is much faster paced. Smaller maps, shorter lives, fast respawning and getting back in the battle, that kind of thing. Battlefield often has longer average lifespans for a player and huge maps so it takes longer to get places. 

Battlefront is in between the two. Faster paced that Battlefield, a little slower than CoD. When I switched from SWBF2 to Battlefield 2 back in the day, I found Battlefield more relaxing in comparison. It didn't take a constant stream of non-stop killing to place at the top of the leaderboards for a match.

In Battlefront, you can charge into battle relying on your shield and the timing of your somersaults to get in close and beat the enemy. In Battlefield you often have to use cover and tactics; if you just charge in blindly you're dead. So while Battlefield can have very fast paced moments, I say that in general the more realistic nature of Battlefield forces slower battles overall. "

I remember the exact day I got my first stretchmark in my first pregnancy.  I remember what I did, I remember how I felt, and I think I will remember it just as vividly for the rest of my life.  The memory now is far more vivid than the marks.  It took time, lots of time, but they faded, they're almost invisible now.  I wore a bikini this summer and was almost disappointed that my tiger stripes didn't show better.  But the memory of that first one still hurts.

I think my son was almost two years old before I learned to love my breasts again.  I bought a freakishly expensive bra after a rather invasive fitting and it blew my mind.  I think I could count on one hand the number of times I've worn that bra, it's too special for everyday, it reminds me how it felt the first time and how it changed my view.

You'll have these moments and these struggles and these achievements too.  It takes time to feel good as a woman again and find yourself in the mommy suit that takes over for a while.  But you will.

For now I have a few suggestions for you aside from the standard ""eye on the prize"" mentality.

 * talk to your doctor about how you're feeling, it might be that there is more going on than basic body issues and help that is available.

 * talk to your husband about how you're feeling and ask him to help.  Sometimes they take their cues from us and don't mention it not because it bothers them, but because they know it bothers us.  Tell him what you need from him and give him the chance to be there for you.

 * Pamper yourself.  Focus on positives if you can find them like glossy hair, healthy skin, strong nails.  Look for clothes that make you feel good, even if you never look at them in a mirror.  If you can find some that you think look cute, even better.  

 * Take pictures.  I know it is the last thing you want to do, get your husband to take them, never look at them, destroy anything you don't like, show no one.  But someday, when your little bean is old enough to wonder, have a picture to show when s/he lived in your belly.

I know it's hard, but I promise it does get better.  You have people who care about you, it's ok to need help."

I've now got a 250GB EVO (OSX boot), a 1TB Barracuda (current Windows boot), a 500GB EVO ( to be Windows boot) ($300 on Amazon. That's quite a drop from the original $600 or so that it was on release), a 1TB Barracuda (Windows storage) and a 750GB Caviar Black (OSX storage). I am a TPB enthusiast so I really use that space.

I like /u/mycroft1895 idea for the crop - there's a lot of asphalt in the foreground that's reflecting light, and sky in the background showing noise.  

I would say - if possible, take the picture at a time when traffic is less, to help avoid vibrations (may not be possible).  I would also say if you don't want to crop, try zooming in and re-framing it, with the cross taking up much more space if that is your subject.  The long exposure allows the headlights that take up most of the picture to blow out those lines, drawing attention to them

rohrspatz,AskReddit,1388636636.0,"&gt;I wish doctors wouldn't refer to people as cases.

They usually don't. The phrase ""seeing a case"" usually expresses the whole concept of studying and treating an incidence of a certain type of illness, not just the literal physical viewing of a patient. In essence,

&gt;most practitioners won't see more than a few cases [**of these diseases**] in a career.

not,

&gt;most practitioners won't see more than a few [**patients with these diseases**] in a career.

Although both phrases have basically the same *overall* meaning, I think it's important to emphasize that medical professionals are definitely not equating people with cases. I might say to my colleague, ""I saw a textbook pneumonia case the other day"", but I don't mean the patient, I mean his/her symptoms and lab results. I.e., if I were speaking with the patient, I wouldn't say, ""You *are* a typical case of pneumonia"", I'd say, ""You *have* a typical case of pneumonia"". Make sense?"

RichAfterTaxes,gamecollecting,1388636720.0,"I always say that the SNES is the retro system for people who don't like retro gaming. That's not some sort of weird diss towards you, the SNES or anyone else; I've just noticed that many of the gamers who favor modern systems (i.e. /r/gaming) tend to stick their noses up at systems like the NES and anything Sega, while nonetheless keeping a place in their hearts for the SNES. 

Maybe it's the quality of the SNES library. Maybe it's Nintendo's own love of the SNES era, and their efforts to keep it in the public eye (EarthBound reissue, A Link to the Past Sequel, Donkey Kong Country revival, etc). Maybe it's Maybelline. At any rate, the SNES market has attracted a whole lot of people, and it's not one of the cheapest systems to collect for - not by a long shot. However, it is definitely possible to have a good time on the cheap. Some essentials you can get for a few bucks each: 

* PilotWings: Flight simulator that I personally prefer over Star Fox. Nice variety of gameplay options, a surprisingly good sense of humor and a godly soundtrack - what's not to love? 

* Kirby's Avalanche: The puzzle game ""Puyo Puyo"" with a fresh coat of Kirby paint. Probably the best puzzler available on the system - much better than, say, Tetris 2. 

* SimCity: Excellent port of a classic. It still holds up! 

* F-Zero: A good start to a great franchise. Even sealed copies are cheap! 

* Street Fighter II: This probably goes without saying, really. I'm pretty sure all the SNES versions of it are cheap, but they practically give away the original in particular. 

In particular, I'd say the top three in particular hold their own with any of the main classics on the system. Most of those other classics will cost you $15 at the very least, though, but they really are worth it. Donkey Kong Country 2, Yoshi's Island, Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Super Mario RPG are my other favorites on there (note that the latter is more like $40-ish). And if you ever find a copy of EarthBound for cheap, buy it ASAP and consider yourself a very lucky man. Not only is it the best game on the system, it's worth well over $100 at full market value.

We did our ""homework"" and put effort into one another every day. The girl he cheated with was younger, terribly immature and posted youtube videos (even posted the videos on reddit), blew up his facebook, etc. Their two months together was broadcast for me to see, sometimes a song, memory or bad day can get me angry over it again but those are the days I need my husband to love me more. If we hadn't gone to therapy, we wouldn't be together. Communication was the only thing that saved our marriage. We are coming up on the 2 year anniversary of his leaving and I can honestly say I'm wayyy ahead of where I thought we would be.

I really liked the name Domina for a girl, we would have called her Mina (Mee-nah) but I love that the name means noble lady, it's a strong name but the short form is easy for everyday.  I still really like it.  

No one else likes it.  No one.  

Now if I had simply introduced my family to Mina the day she was born, not a word would have been said to me.  But telling them while we were still deciding they felt free to critique and ridicule.  We had a boy so it didn't matter, but I will never EVER give anyone the chance to do that again.  I would have used it anyway, but it would have made me sad knowing people didn't like it.

This time around we're keeping it a secret.  I find it easier to pretend we don't have names picked.  We joke that we've used all the names we like so it will be either myname Junior or husbandsname Junior.  If pressed I will tell people that we aren't telling, my babies get their names when they are born and not before.  I may also imply that my husband and I are fighting about it and don't want to discuss it.  But I sure as hell will not worry about hurting people's feelings by not telling, it's not like they worried about hurting my feelings by mocking a name I liked!

For what it is worth I absolutely adore the name Ambellina.  It's unique but not crazy, very lyrical, you've got several options for pet names like Amy, Bella, or Lina, any of which would be cute for a little girl.  Your husband already loves it (and he married you so clearly has good taste).  Plus, who cares if it sounds similar to Thumbellina, she was born from a flower and becomes a fairy!  How cool is that?  Honestly I'd be using that for my nursery theme!

People can find fault with any name, ANY name.  If you start using it, it will grow on you, you can't help but like it once it belongs to your baby!  "

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1388638114.0,"&gt;3) No matriarchies... I suppose I single handedly inserted all those matriarchal lineage accounts into the old Hebrew Bible...

You must've, since there aren't any.

&gt;Let's forget that the very name Druid is composed of two Celtic word roots which are also in Sanskrit. ""vid"" or ""uid"" for knowledge and ""dru"" meaning ""immersion"". I am pose as Professor Calvert Watkins of Harvard, in my spare time. I/He is one of the leading linguistic experts in his field, and pointed out that old Gaelic Irish is quite easy to connect with early Indo-European root words, specifically old Vedic Sanskrit.
I mean, its just pure coincidence that in Old Irish ""arya"" (the word for free man) is in Sanskrit ""aire"" (noble man). It's just pure coincidence that in Gaelic the word for good is ""naib"" and in Sanskrit it ""noeib"". Total happenstance that king is ""righ"" and in Sanskrit it's ""raja"", I could do this with thousands of words... But I'd just be making it all up, right?I mean I'm PURE ""quackery!""

No one's doubting that proto-Indo-European existing.  We're doubting your interpretation of etymologies that are either dubious or make logical leaps.  IE linguistics isn't quackery, but your etymological connections are.

For instance:

&gt;I could go and on, but why bother? The one thing you did research you stopped with at the latin definition. As if Latin was the first language, why not check it's PARENT language? The word Avunculus in latin is based on AVUS of Sanskrit (a child of the early indo-european language), I suppose I invented all those documents too regarding how avus line determined clan structure...

Maybe.  But ""ancestor"" is unrelated to ""avunculus"".  It's from the Latin antecessor, meaning ""predessesor"" (cf ante + cede).  No connection to matriarchy whatsoever.  And your other etymology was that ""quran"" means ""goddess speaks"", which is a steaming pile of bullshit.  The Semitic root qr' is quite well-attested, and is used for religious recitation in other Semitic languages with which Arabic had contact.  No goddess nonsense needed.  In fact, no goddess nonsense is possible--qur'an is the noun form of that root I mentioned, and cannot contain any other meanings--it's literally just a root put in a noun form.

About polytheism among ancient Israelites, people worshiped Asherah.  But only as YHWH's consort.  They worshiped one goddess, but had a main-deity who was male.  If you think that equates to a female-centric religion you're fooling yourself."

JewSmurf,thesopranos,1388638600.0,"   Considering Paulie was promoted in the last episode, I think he would be the most likely candidate to take control of the family.  I'd imagine Patsy would become underboss and either Benny, Walden or Dante (Tony's driver) would be given command of the Aprile/Cestone/Cifaretto/Spatafore crew because of their efforts not only in assisting with the Phil Leotardo problem put also with all of their collective endeavors near the end of the series.  While it's almost universally agreed that Tony was killed, the more pertinent question is WHO killed him.  To me, the candidates are as follows:

Butch DeConcini - The most likely perpetrator, in my opinion.  There are several reasons that Butch might have wanted Tony dead.  He could have simply given Tony permission to whack Phil in order to gain control of the New York family, then gone through with the hit Phil placed regardless.  The massive, insightful blog post by Master of Sopranos suggests that Butch ordering Tony's death could be related to the Phil Leotardo hit.  Phil was shot in front of his family, and subsequently had his head crushed, therefore rendering an open casket funeral out of the question.  Butch might have taken this as an insult and had Tony killed in front of his family as well.

Patsy Parisi - Patsy obviously held a vendetta against Tony for the murder of his brother Philly.  He may have harbored this resentment over the course of the entire series and only acted on it when the family was crippled and likely unable to retaliate.  Another interesting theory I've seen, also from Master of Sopranos, is that Patsy killed Tony over a fear of being killed for seemingly flipping.  This relates to Carlo's disappearance after his son Jason was arrested, and Tony's suspicions that he might be ratting in order to save Jason.  In the last few episodes, there is a cleverly hidden subplot regarding Patsy and his own son.  There are several moments where Patsy becomes uncomfortable at the mention of Carlo's disappearance, and a few times where Tony directly mentions it to him in an accusatory manner.  Patsy is also earlier seen calling his son away from a table where Carlo's son was sitting.  So it's possible that Patsy feared Tony would have him killed over the possibility of snitching to protect HIS son, and Patsy acted first.

Carlo Gervasi - To me, the least likely perpetrator, although there were several hints that Carlo could have ordered the death of Tony.  One is the murder by strangulation of Burt Gervasi.  Burt was Carlo's cousin, and although it is never explicitly stated it is safe to assume that the two were quite close.  It's possible that Burt was able to sway Carlo into joining New York during the war with Jersey, and that's the reason he wanted Tony dead.  It's also possible that he was simply angry at his cousin being murdered and had Tony killed as revenge.  A second, much looser note is the matter of Carlo's ratting.  Similar to Patsy, Carlo might have feared that the word of him testifying was getting out and had Tony whacked in order to save himself from a possible attempt on his own life.

     Although you never inquired into the matter of Tony's death in your post, it's very important to consider if you're speculating what would have happened after the series ended.  If Butch did it, would Paulie have found out?  Would he have taken action against New York?  His efforts would likely fall flat, as the family was already heavily damaged from the actions of Phil Leotardo.  If it was Patsy, would he be killed in return?  Almost certainly, as killing a boss is a massive offence.  He may have taken the Phil Leotardo approach and gone into hiding afterward, though.  If Carlo had done it, could they have got to him?  He was presumably under federal protection, so it would be very difficult.  These are all things to consider when contemplating the many branching paths that the characters and plot would take after that ending shot of darkness fades back into color.

blaghart,AdviceAnimals,1388638716.0,"Actually it does.  For a variety of reasons:

1: none of the blacks that are alive were ever enslaved.  They never experienced the hardship or any of it.  In short, they are just as involved in the ""suffering"" as anyone else, so to act as though they have inherently suffered more than whites because of their ancestors is stupid.

2: What happened to them was not unique, it was a global business that traded in everyone regardless of race.  To act as though whites (who never lived during the time of american slavery) are responsible for the actions of dead men is to hold the prime minister of italy responsible for the deaths of the crusades.

3: It ignores the reality of the modern world, that ""institutionalized racism"" isn't born out of slavery but good old fashioned human bigotry, that parents taught their kids that people are lesser for being different.  And worst of all this generates a cultural belief that institutionalized racism cannot be stopped, mitigated, or defeated, when in truth it can be defeated by teaching each generation not to hate.

They like sun too, but tend to be tougher and less demanding than veggies. Maybe try some cilantro, rosemary, sage, chives...all pretty easy. Cilantro will reseed and the others should be available year round.

But if I were you here's what I'd do: look into community gardens in your area. Where I live they call them ""P patches"" but you could just google ""community gardens."" You get a small chunk of land in a larger plot, and you can grow veggies to your heart's content. 

As far as your balcony, please don't think that you can't grow dozens of interesting flowers, shrubs, trees, you name it. Visit a local plant nursery and ask what's right for growing in a container in your area. And congratulations! You are embarking on a really fascinating adventure. You will love it!"

every wire was electrical taped together, and everytime you hit a bump the stereo may or may not start/stop working.

also completely disconnected the (functional amp and sub).

ending up having to buy a new wire to run under the carpet to the amp, and rewire the whole thing...
 forgot to mention they cut off all of the factory connectors so i couldnt even buy a wiring harness. 

took me 4 hours and i only ended up making 300 bucks profit on the vehicle.

People never believe me when I tell them I make the best homemade macaroni and cheese in the world, and use the microwave. They insist pasta has to be boiled.  But they shut up after they try my shit.

Here's what you do:

1) Pour raw pasta of choice into big microwave-safe bowl.

2) Fill bowl with hot tap water til it's about 1/2 an inch above the top of the pasta.

3) For a two-person serving, microwave for about 10 minutes. If there's any water still in the bowl, nuke it for another 3 min then let it sit for a few to soak it up.  If there's still a lot of water in the bowl, go ahead and drain it.

4) Stir in grated cheese. Use whatever you like, but I prefer extra-sharp cheddar, and some Parmesan.  Then comes the secret ingredient: mayonnaise!  Dump in a few big dollops.  I usually don't add milk, but you can if you insist on making it runny.

5) Put it back in the microwave for a few min to melt the cheese.

6) Season it with whatever you like, but try it vanilla first to see how you like it. I usually use a combination of black pepper, garlic powder, and sometimes a little cayenne.  If you have any, Frank's Buffalo Sauce is outstanding with this, as it is with everything."
leavenworth,TheBluePill,1388640664.0,"One problem I've noticed is that young, naive, and often affluent people who join these movements misunderstand several elements.

I think a good example of what I mean can be found in the comments on the blog Your Fave Is Problematic. The purpose of the blog is basically to show how a great number of likable people have problematic opinions. However, people reblogging will say ""ugh, never reading her books again!"" or ""wow who knew he was such an incredible douche?""

Everybody knows that not everyone is pressed into conforming to gender roles. When people talk about gender issues they mean the difference in prevalence of certain social issues between the sexes, not something one gender is exposed to as a whole without exception.

I should also point out that social expectations are not always explicitly stated or implied [(Though sometimes they are.)](http://www.operatorchan.org/w/src/138138873152.jpg)

Few men are explicitly told that dangerous professions are something they have to do to be real men, but our culture glorifies men that put themselves in danger for the greater good (Are male action heroes overwhelmingly male or female?), and the fact that the vast majority of these dangerous professions are overwhelmingly made up of men sends a message that these jobs are overwhelmingly for men."

MidnightSlinks,nutrition,1388641529.0,"That is the experience of many with Celiac disease, but they are not having an allergic reaction. Some Celiac patients have very strong reactions to gluten where the entirety of their microvilli are wiped out from a single bite. Others can consume gluten (against all medical advice) and have milder symptoms, though long-term damage is the larger concern in adults. Lactose intolerance is not an allergy either. It is a lack of a digestive enzyme and the discomfort is a byproduct of excess sugar (lactose) entering the colon where bacteria have a field day on breaking it down (gas) and the colon draws in water to dilute it (diarrhea).

An allergy means that the immune system overreacts to an otherwise benign protein. Gluten allergies exist and reactions could include one or more of: nausea, vomiting, hives, or anaphylaxis. Undiagnosed Celiac disease is much more likely than an undiagnosed allergy, but both are very serious and if suspected, a physician should be consulted."

&gt;She is not too far off. After the attack on Pearl Harbor their was a massive hysteria against Japanese Americans. Their where ""Japanese Hunting Licenses"" handed out. But the protection of the Japanese was not the only reason it was done.

This was not an official justification for the internment.  Interment was explicitly done for military reasons--that's what Executive Order 9066 talks about.  The Supreme Court decisions explicitly referenced concerns of disloyalty--read [this one](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=320&amp;page=81) and [this one](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=323&amp;invol=214).  Some choice selections:

&gt;&gt;The Chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee explained on the floor of the Senate that the purpose of the proposed legislation was to provide means of enforcement of curfew orders and other military orders made pursuant to Executive Order No. 9066. He read General DeWitt's Public Proclamation No. 1, and statements from newspaper reports that 'evacuation of the first Japanese aliens and American-born Japanese' was about to begin. **He also stated to the Senate that 'reasons for suspected widespread fifth-column activity among Japanese' were to be found in the system of dual citizenship which Japan deemed applicable to American- [320 U.S. 81, 91]   born Japanese, and in the propaganda disseminated by Japanese consuls, Buddhist priests and other leaders, among American-born children of Japanese.** Such was stated to be the explanation of the contemplated evacuation from the Pacific Coast area of persons of Japanese ancestry, citizens as well as aliens.

--

&gt;&gt;After the disastrous bombing of Pearl Harbor the military had a grave problem on its hands. The threat of Japanese invasion of the west coast was not fanciful but real. The presence of many thousands of aliens and citizens of Japanese ancestry in or near to the key points along that coast line aroused special concern in those charged with the defense of the country. They believed that not only among aliens but also among citizens of Japanese ancestry there were those who would give aid and comfort to the Japanese invader and act as a fifth column before and during an invasion.

--

&gt;&gt;Like curfew, exclusion of those of Japanese origin was deemed necessary because of the presence of an unascertained number of disloyal members of the group, most of [323 U.S. 214, 219] whom we have no doubt were loyal to this country.

Certainly if it had been about protecting the interned they would've been consulted first.  Besides, this is factually dubious.  Internment began months after Pearl Harbor, and no widespread violence against Japanese-Americans took place, though discrimination increased.  Certainly nothing requiring their removal for their own protection.

Or have a look [here](http://www.sfmuseum.org/war/dewitt0.html).  This governor's report speaks of Japanese disloyalty, with explicit racist nonsense:

&gt;&gt;**The evacuation was impelled by military necessity.** The security of the Pacific Coast continues to require the exclusion of Japanese from the area now prohibited to them and will so continue as long as that military necessity exists....More than 115,000 persons of Japanese ancestry resided along the coast and were significantly concentrated near many highly sensitive installations essential to the war effort. Intelligence services records reflected the existence of hundreds of Japanese organizations in California, Washington, Oregon and Arizona which, prior to December 7, 1941, were actively engaged in advancing Japanese war aims. These records also disclosed that thousands of American-born Japanese had gone to Japan to receive their education and indoctrination there and had become rabidly pro-Japanese and then had returned to the United States. Emperor-worshipping ceremonies were commonly held and millions of dollars had flowed into the Japanese imperial war chest from the contributions freely made by Japanese here. The continued presence of a large, unassimilated, tightly knit and racial group, bound to an enemy nation by strong ties of race, culture, custom and religion along a frontier vulnerable to attack constituted a menace which had to be dealt with. Their loyalties were unknown and time was of the essence. The evident aspirations of the enemy emboldened by his recent successes made it worse than folly to have left any stone unturned in the building up of our defenses.

That was, of course, just as wild of a claim as your post, but it shows that racism lead to imagined military concerns.  And on that:

&gt;Something people don't EVER talk about is the Niihau Incident.
  So to set the stage you have an attack on the US thats unheard of by Japan. You have stories for the last 10 years comming in about attrocities in China and throughout the pacific. Then you have the Niihau Incident. I think people ignore this do to its ""inconvenience"".

Inconvenient to whom?  The hundreds of thousands of Japanese-Americans who displayed no disloyalty but were guilty by association?

&gt;Immediately after the attack a Japanese Plane crashed on a inhabited island. Several Japanese Americans helped and hid the pilot and aided the pilot in escape and attacked guards meant to protect him. Luckily the Pilot was captured and the JA's where arrested as well. But the US freaked the hell out over this. You had these JA's that had shown ZERO signs of being capable of helping out the enemy and yet they willingly aided and helped without much resistance.

First of all, this is the first part of your post that has some merit.  The Ni'ihau incident is relevant, because of the concerns created.  You're misrepresenting the narrative more than a bit.  Three Japanese-Americans aided a downed airman who'd been captured by a group of Hawai'ian natives.  Exactly what their end-game was is unclear.  They helped a Japanese guy, not Japan.

But you're missing the important context that the government itself [determined that they posed no substantial threat](http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/jap%20intern.htm), and that the desire for internment was due to racism.  In fact, the primary concern was violence due to the discriminatory and harmful policies in the US, not the war."

&gt;I think I am still puzzled by how the far right can have so much influence in Israel. And I think I won't ever understand it until I learn more about the history that is right now just a big gap in my mind.

Eh, their influence is mostly kinda filtered.  It's not as though people are trying to re-establish Kach with wide support.  The craziest of the settlers are a pretty small minority, but more of the right-wing sees it as a concession for nothing when their unauthorized settlements are dismantled.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388642135.0,"&gt;Why not debt to revenue generated by the IRS?

You could do that.



Actually calculating government debt to GDP is not trivial when you want data for many countries, because every country has different rules on who can borrow how much and when, and then who owns various assets.  If you have a central bank that is independent of the government but has assets do you count those?  What about state  owned companies (including say... GM, which is supposed to be only temporarily owned). 

Every country has different rules about cities, counties, provinces/states, nations, the  whole nation, corporations, crown corporations, pension funds, etc. etc. etc. It ends up very complicated borrowing things.  And counting assets is comparably difficult.  

But since you can always raise taxes to try and pay debt, debt as a percentage of GDP based on outstanding bonds, is a fairly convenient mechanism.  There are odd outliers though.  Sure, Japan has had astronomical debt as a percentage of GDP for a while (basically double anyone else), but they have astronomically huge financial assets too, so their net position is basically the same as everyone else, the money is just shuffled around a bit.  

Edit: always as in within the ranges of debt we're talking about.  If you are doing particularly badly and have 100% of GDP in debt at  10% interest you might need to raise taxes a lot, from 40  or 50% of GDP to 50 or 60.  But that's not the end of the world.  Not good.  But not the end of the world.  "

Canadian_Government,changemyview,1388642595.0,"What make this deity a good definition of morality? If a god existed and that god were spiteful and full of hatred, their rules could not be argued to be moral. We as a species may decide that our own rules are more morally sound than this spiteful god's. You could not possibly know for sure if your god is truly of perfect moral compass (or even that he is all-knowing)! To blindly follow its rules, to base your beliefs off of what is written in the bible, is to ignore morality. You would be following the orders of your god, regardless of whether or not they are truly moral or good.

You're right in that morality cannot be truly objective, just like no scientific experiment or explanation of a phenomenon cannot be truly objective. We teach and learn about our world anyway. This inevitably leads to mistakes and inconsistencies. Our world is not perfect, we do the best we can with what we know and believe.

You seem to suggest that we are incapable of having true moral rules without diction from an absolute power or deity. If you only believe that which may be dictated by such a power can be truly correct, do you only believe that which is in the bible? That the laws of physics and all we know of the world is insufficient because it hasn't been so told by a god?"

Durinthal,MLPLounge,1388643636.0,"[](/raritynews) That doesn't look right at all. You can't have strength and constitution scores below 1 or else you're automatically dead (well, this goes for 3.5e/PF, don't recall exactly what 4e is but probably similar). I can't verify it right now but it looks like you're using the racial modifiers to your ability scores in place of the actual ability scores instead of just adding/subtracting them. I played a changeling rogue in 4th edition once and had a lot of fun with it, and I definitely don't recall the stats being like that.

Usually you either use an array (a predefined set of six numbers you assign to the scores you want, they'll usually be in the 10-18 range) or if you really want randomness, roll to get something between 3 and 18 for each ability score. Those are the numbers you apply racial modifiers to. Unless something goes radically wrong or you *really* know what you're doing your ability modifiers should be in the -1 to +5 range straight out of character creation.

If you want help figuring any of that out let me know and I'll see what I can do in the morning; I've been playing and DMing for years and even though it's been a while since I've hit 4th edition I can guide you through the basics.

That's like going to a support group for some problem and being bothered by the fact that most people aren't super positive all the time. As a short guy, you may have noticed that most people are very dismissive of short guys complaining about their height. You usually hear that your problems are either made up and/or you just need confidence. 

Actually, there was a recent post on /r/short detailing how the sub is actually *mostly positive content.* You're just overlooking it.

As a short guy myself, I deal by changing what I can. I change my body by exercising and eating healthy. I change my appearance by wearing flattering, well-fitting clothes. I change my behavior by not accepting other people's BS and insults while acting how I want to act. I'm going to be fit, sharp, and suave so being short isn't the focus of my worries.

Most importantly, I deal by being sympathetic to other people: I wish other people were aware of the hurt they sometimes cause, so I try to be sympathetic instead of dismissive. Ultimately, I think that makes me a better person."

So I'm ribbing this guy in disbelief because he's easily 20 years older than her and he started getting upset. Then he walked away. Ok. no prob. But I'm a dumb shit. And am just acting goofy and making mocking taunts from across the bar. he come back. Hmmm. Bad step 2.

So we start chatting. He then threatens to beat me up. Which I scoff at because no one actually fights me. Ever. No one has ever thrown a punch at me. I'm a rather large guy, but I'm never physically aggressive. I'm not a lifter or anything. But my scoffs irritate him even more. So then he says he has a gun. Huh. I had gotten back from working a job in Kuwait where things were wacky with the Initial invasion scuds, so I'm curious but fear hasn't hit me. So I tell him I don't believe him and pushed him verbally to pull it. Bad step 3

All of sudden there's what looks like a little .32 or .380 automatic. It's shiny. and tiny. It's pressed into my belly.  I start laughing. Full on drunken belly laughing at him. He got so pissed. I could barely stand I was laughing so hard. He walked away paid his tab and left.

The reason they ban people that argue the post might not be creepy is not to be some PC oppression of free speech, it's because the subreddit was considerably worse off with threads getting derailed with arguments questioning every little detail.

In a more complicated case of 387 + 229, I think *Let's see, 387 is basically 400. 400 + 229 = 629. I added 13 to 387 to get 400, so let's take away 13. Thus, the answer is 616.*

The same works for multiplication. When I see something like 67\*19, I say *Well, I can do* 20\*67 *easily. Let's see.* 2\*67 = *140 - 6 = 134* (2\*70 - 2\*3). *So 67\*20 = 1340.

* 4x 185g tins of tuna chunks in olive oil
* 1x red onion, diced
* 1x orange bell pepper/capsicum, diced
* 1x red bell pepper/capsicum, diced
* 1x 420g tin four bean mix, drained

* 1/4 cup mayonnaise 
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin 
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander 
* 1 tablespoon hot salsa, or to taste
* salt and pepper, to taste 


**OK NOW WHAT?**  

Chuck everything except the cumin, salt, pepper, coriander and salsa in a bowl. Mix. Add cumin, then salt &amp; pepper to taste. Finally add coriander and salsa.

I used a bit more salsa than the recipe called for and still thought it could've used more. I served it on a bed of typical salad greens, eg- lettuce, rocket, baby spinach. You could very easily put this in taco shells instead of meat, or in sammiches."

cyranothe2nd,needadvice,1388645978.0,"Are you planning to go to grad school? If not, don't worry about your GPA so much. What matters is that you comprehend the material. Most employers aren't going to care what your GPA is--they will care that you can pass the technical interview. 

As far as switching to EE--if you like it better, do it! It's a great career choice. It sounds like you understand why you struggled in these classes and can do better next semester.

 It might take a while for your brain to get up to speed in a new major, and it is likely that you have a gap in your knowledge that other students have. This can be ameliorated by going to office hours. I am a college prof and believe me, we LOVE students coming to see us. You can get a lot of one-on-one help from the prof and grad students. Also, you can email if you can't make office hours. But make contact with the prof asap. It will really help you.

Good luck!"

OswegoWriter,AskReddit,1388646335.0,"Make a unique grilled cheese sandwich. Pick a fancyass cheese, add two ingredients that pair well with said fancyass cheese when grilled, serve on complementary bread (complementary condiment optional, but sometimes a nice touch).

I do a gouda-bacon-apple on rosemary bread lightly coated in olive oil. It takes ten minutes to prep, and only a few minutes to cook:

Note: I'm incredibly lazy in the morning, so I pre-bake and refrigerate a half dozen or so rashers of bacon. To do this, just preheat the ol' oven to  175°C/350°F, put your rashers on a baking tray on a baking sheet so the fat drips down, then cook until you think they're done to your liking.

Anyway, get a pan, brush it with olive oil so that it gets a nice, thick coat, but doesn't flow. Cut two slices of rosemary bread, then layer apple, Gouda, bacon. The trick is to use one half of the coated pan for one side, then flip onto the other side of the pan. You can also brush the olive oil on if your pan's going to be crowded. If you're feeling fancy, put a dollop of Dijon mustard on the plate and do that spoon dragging thing. Or don't. "

vaginal nerve endings are front loaded so more girth=more stimulation even if you're not particularly long. obviously there is an upper limit here for pleasure that is variable for different people/orifices, but in general girth is a way better indicator if you can/can't do something and how it will feel."

I'd say the only Israeli activists worth lauding in the way you're talking are not thick on the ground and your prior claim about Jewish organizations in America caring about peace holds even less water.

&gt; compared to say, the policies of Burundi or Belize?

Do you know what the policies of Burundi or Belize are?

For sure, they don't behave the way Israel behaves-- nor do they whine and bitch and complain the way Israel does on an international level.

To be honest, the people in Southeast Asia can't be judged, as you're doing, by one opinion poll. They have more pressing issues to address, and these will naturally take precedent as opposed to the Israeli/Jewish fantasy of ""the evil ones hating us and being anti semitic all day every day"".

By the time I was 19 or 20, we all seemed to have a pretty similar maturity level, both emotionally and physically. I've observed the same in the young college students I interact with as part of my job, as well - the men and the women act and look about as mature as each other to me."

&gt; Motto had a patient who committed suicide from the Golden Gate in 1963, but the jump that affected him most occurred in the seventies. “I went to this guy’s apartment afterward with the assistant medical examiner,” he told me. “The guy was in his thirties, lived alone, pretty bare apartment. He’d written a note and left it on his bureau. It said, ‘I’m going to walk to the bridge. If one person smiles at me on the way, I will not jump.’ ”

He used to wait to spray it until I came over. It's got a warm, sweet scent that's reminiscent of vanilla. More yummy than anything.

It's got a darker, spicy, masculine scent that's quite sexy and works well for events where you'll be in close proximity and/or dancing with the ladies. (edit: Unfortunately this scent is ruined for me due to its association with my brother, but I frequently recommend it to guys I'm not planning to date as I know it to be very successful.)

Tried-and-true staples that smell good but won't win you points for originality:

* Old Spice (stick with classic)
* Acqua di Gio
* Armani Code
* Curve by Liz Claiborne

As always, apply sparingly (over-application is the most common mistake that cologne newbies make). For example, you know how Axe tells you to spray across your chest horizontally, then down your chest diagonally? DO NOT DO THAT. That is too much cologne. One quick spritz in the area of your neck/chest is plenty."

I'll forego eating lunch about half the week, and I almost certainly eat out for the other half.

imu96,changemyview,1388649901.0,"While I agree with you that currently ""white"" groups are doing better. This has not always been the case. In fact, if you were to look at the middle ages, you would find that there are (in my opinion) strong indicators that non-white people were better off. 

For example. If you take a look at the dark ages (aprox 6th-13th) where Western European countries (""white"" countries) weren't doing so well after the decline of the Roman Empire, Arab countries seemed to be thriving. Since there was no HDI or ""happiest countries"" thing back then, so instead look at technological advancements because those seemed to go hand in hand with more developed countries (to some extent at least). 

So while the dark ages were going on in Europe, empires such as the Fatimid, Abbasid, and Umayyad were thriving. In the 11th century, the law of sines was discovered by Muslim mathematicians, Ibn Sinna (Avicenna) published his ""The Book of Healing"" (a scientific encyclopedia) and ""The Canon of Medicine"" which was one of the most influential medical texts over the next 6 centuries. 

During those times Chinese civilizations were also thriving but I don't know a lot about those. But they also published some important works of science if I'm not mistaken.

Basically what I'm trying to get at is that every dog has its day. Right now it's the ""white"" countries turn. Because they are currently dominant, it will be their history that is dominant as they have the loudest voice. You will mostly here about their scientific achievements and stuff. But truth be told, there was a time when they _weren't_ the dominant force that they are today. So it's just kind of a cycle. Later on, some other general race of people might take over, trumpet their history, and everyone will think they have been dominant all along.

Who said it wasn't? 

&gt;A warrant implies giving authorization to commit an act that would otherwise violate someone's legal rights, e.g., you've basically said that cops are now not giving people drugs freely, they are ordering people to take drugs so that they can see the effects.

I never said that. In any way. Probably shouldn't put words into people's mouths.  

&gt;Nevermind that in this country it has repeatedly been established that an individual has the right to refuse any form of medication whatsoever, which would include drugs of any form. Nevermind that it has repeatedly been established by law that you cannot use a person as a test subject without their knowledge and will. Nevermind that you cannot, under any circumstances in this country, give someone who is judged mentally competent to make their own decisions any form of medication, medical assistance, what the fuck ever, if they choose to refuse it.

Who said *anything* about cops forcing anyone to take them?

So you're blaming something that doesn't exist, that can't be fixed.  When in truth it's the opposite, slavery didn't create bigotry, bigotry created slavery.  And blacks continuing to use the ""your grandpa enslaved my grandpa so I should get a one up on you"" arguement aren't fixing the problem, they're accentuating it.

""ligare"" meaning to bind or tie/reconnect, so being part of a region is way one ties themselves to the past, their ancestors, and their culture. To remove the mysticism and fantastical surrounding Christ does not make those teachings any less a powerful philosophy than those of Buddha, Nietzsche, or Descartes. It is not pointless at least to me, because one can  enjoy the rich historical connection that comes with being a part of of a community while also harnessing the power of the church to do good works for those in need to make a positive impact.  Can this be done in other ways, sure but to each his own. To me ones does not have to prescribe to inerrant dogma or fantastical tales to be a part of that, especially considering what mankind has learned about the natural world and the laws that govern our existence, many of which contradict that ""inerrant"" word. Thomas Jefferson for instance held similar views, as did John Locke and others. So in other words it is not taking Christ out of anything but rather refusing to hold to a worldview that is so limiting in my opinion. Again this is my opinion and is why I never offered anything in my previous posts in regards to my own belief, I was simply commenting on the other commentators offering of ""proof"" of the resurrection of Christ which put to a reasonably objective standard left room for many interpretations contrary to what they were saying.

As it is, I'm smoking a cig right now but my MBV order arrives tomorrow. There has been a recent change that should eliminate my need to buy tobacco now. The little 24 hour mart closest to my house just started carrying $6 bottles of juice. Wish I'd known that before I bought the tobacco across the street. I'm no longer at the mercy of the over priced shops with bankers hours any more. 

But back to my point, vaping works for me because it is so stress free. And I've cut my nic juice from 24 to 12 mg. There is an end game, I'm just not stressing out over it."

Just right off the bat, you can not oppose or support something. But to get to the situation at hand, most of us probably honestly don't even know about the problem of income inequality. That means we can't oppose or support it, so supporting it's already off the table.

But then what about the whole ""If there were serious opposition things would change"" sentiment? Well, what's ""serious opposition?"" There are plenty of things most people are opposed to that continue, but it would need *action* to change it. Plus, there are plenty of things we cannot change (eh, at least not without more massive changes on enormous scales).

Anyway, the point is that ""if there was serious opposition then things would change"" is bullshit because propaganda, systemic mechanisms to resist change, apathy, and lots more are all things that exist."

&gt;&gt; Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal indicated to Robert Pastor, senior adviser to the Carter Center, that the Charter is ""a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons.""[76] Hamas do not use the Charter on their website and prefer to use their election manifesto to put forth their agenda.[77][78] Pastor states that those who quote the charter rather than more recent Hamas statements may be using the Charter as an excuse to ignore Hamas.[76]

&gt;&gt; British diplomat and former British ambassador to the United Nations Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated in early 2009 that the Hamas charter was ""drawn up by a Hamas-linked imam some [twenty] years ago and has never been adopted since Hamas was elected as the Palestinian government in 2006"".[79] Mohammed Nimer of American University comments on the Charter, ""It's a tract meant to mobilize support and it should be amended... It projects anger, not vision.""[80] Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, has questioned the use of the charter by Israel and its supporters to brand Hamas as a fundamentalist, terrorist, racist, anti-Semitic organization and claims that they have taken parts of the charter out of context for propaganda purposes. He claims that they dwell on the charter and ignore that Hamas has changed its views with time.[81]

I think it costs money, but one app I know that teaches vocabulary at all levels is JLPT Study. (Black words over a Japanese flag).

theodore_boozevelt,CrazyIdeas,1388651635.0,"As someone who has attempted suicide, I find this really fucking offensive. 


I know that this is in ""crazy ideas,"" and I'm really fucking hoping that you are in some sort of ""crazy"" state of mind. 


You think that people would ""thoughtfully consider"" and come to the conclusion that suicide is the best option. That they would reason themselves into a logical and humane way to die. Here's the thing: people who want to kill themselves are NOT REASONABLE. They are literally not in the right mind. And they will LIE. So here's what happens in your little ""suicide is legal"" scenario: 


Someone is suicidal, probably due a mental illness. They then see this as a viable option, and decide to go for it. They will claim that they have better reasons than ""I want to die,"" and they'll stick to it. It'll take hard work, and they'll then be allowed to die. 


This then leaves a person with a curable or treatable disease dead. Off this earth, this wonderful and beautiful and crazy world where people love them, where they can work hard to improve the lives of themselves and those around them. A world where anyone can somehow end up changing and  improving it in amazing ways. 


Source: I have depression. I attempted suicide four times, and would have totally supported this while I was sick. And I would lie in my darkest times. I lied to my friends, my teachers, my coaches, my family. And my best friend in the world, my incredible and loving mother. I would lie about anything, and I would be able to weasel my way in or out of situations, possibly like this one (though this is obviously a very extreme example.) 

Since getting treatment, my life has turned around. I became a published writer. I started my own business. I saved two children from drowning. I got into a great school and am currently studying education, so I can get out in the world and try to help it. And I would have been allowed to die if your dumb fucking idea was a real thing. So I thank God it's not, and I ask God to help you not be so dumb in the future.

Consider the fact that the Palestinians are not playing games and are in actuality *not* evil creatures or murderous automatons who ""fight because they hate the jews"", and that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians and the Palestinian diaspora would settle for an actual, proper two-state arrangement-- one that the Israelis didn't fuck around with and kept their dicks out of, which seems impossible for them to do."

I'm going to speak generally here as we aren't really supposed to answer specific relationship questions (there's another sub dedicated to that called /r/relationships). 

If one is uncertain how to proceed after a partner cheats, here are the questions I would propose asking:

* Is s/he likely to continue cheating? If so, are you prepared to deal with that? 
* Would s/he prefer an open relationship? If so, is that something you would prefer?
* If believing a partner is unlikely to cheat is important to you, then what is necessary in order for you to regain that trust in your partner? Do you believe it's even possible to regain that trust once it's been broken?
* If you want to regain trust in your partner, what concrete steps will s/he have to take in order to help you do that?
* What would a trusting, secure relationship look like to you? Do you believe you can turn your relationship into that?
* Are you prepared to address any behaviors you have that may have contributed to your partner's desire to cheat?
* Is your partner prepared to do what's necessary in order to regain your trust? How has s/he demonstrated this?

People do move past cheating in their relationships, but it's very difficult and requires definite action on the part of both parties (but especially the cheater) in order to make it happen. Some people just can't recover from it, and that's OK too. I don't think it's really ""noble"" to stay in a relationship that's devoid of trust, so if that's not something you can get back then martyring yourself in order to prove that you're the bigger person isn't going to help anyone."
