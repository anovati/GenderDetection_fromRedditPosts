Owadatsumi,AskReddit,1389067985.0,"How to communicate. How to take your partner's argument, and assume it is your own. look at it from their perspective without your own argument getting in the way. try and use this point of view to work towards solutions and not more issues. 

Have more sex. Sex is good. 

Do things for each other. Do the little things. Do them with a smile, a kiss, and that's the end of it. 

Flirt with each other. All the time. Flirt shamelessly. This is actually foreplay and will have a positive effect.

Have fun with your partner, shared interests or not. Try and integrate your previously separate interests. 

Alone time or time with friends is also necessary. NO ONE spends every waking moment with their significant other. 

Any others I inevitably missed will be in this thread and others.

Girdon_Freeman,WritingPrompts,1389068548.0,"First day of fourth grade and the little bastard was already raising hell.

Of course, he wasn't actually a bastard son. His mother and I had been married since I was a dru.... uh, drugstore owner. She was my... ""pharmacist"" on call, so to speak. 

Anyways, back to him. He goes in to fourth grade and begins to plan his empire. He started small, I'll give him that. Like all empires, he took a the ""smuggling contraband"" route. Snuck in a couple Cokes every Friday, sold em for $1 a pop. Not a 2 Liter, but a tin can Coke. He started making money then, earning a sizeable beginning portfolio. 

Next, he began to recruit some muscle. Got some fat football players in on his action. Once they proved incompetent, he hired a couple smarter ones to translate, then later lead them. 

After that, he hired more runners for his contraband, eventually expanding into the Swiss Cake Roll and M&amp;M's market. Even started up his own Loan Sharking buisiness. Once he was pulling in $10 a week in pure profit, he never had to get his hands dirty ever again. 

Like all Kingpins, he got sloppy. He got ""high off his own supply"", so to speak. Started drinking cokes and downing M&amp;M's at a stupidly fast rate. Hired what ever the hell was the equivalent of a 4th grade stripper and had himself a ball. 

The Hallway Patrol got word that contraband was flowing through the halls of Wade Freeman Elementary, so they did some sleuthing. After a month of coaxing, mainly from ex-runners and muscle. They had enough evidence to pin him to the crimes. Now they just needed a warrant. 

The principal OK'ed ""Operation: Kidpin"" and issued my son to be brought in, unconcious or alive. Kidpin got word of the assault, so he hastily constructed a base on the playground out of trash cans and a playset, and NERF-armed all his soldiers. Then the HP struck. 

They walked right into an ambush, scaring most of the weaker, greener recruits. The Veteran Patrollers, though, punched the weaker soldiers in the stomache, stole their NERF guns and darts, and retreated to an overturned bench.

The traded gunfire, until one of the shop kids ran up to the bench and handed the Lead Hallway Patroller a metal contraption. The HP threw the grenade and a bunch of BB's flew out, scaring the shit out of Kidpen's soldiers. Many ran, but some remained. 

The tides equal, Kidpin rose to the top of the Base-jim, snorted some ground up Smarties, and shouted out, ""SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND."" He fired the NERF equivalent of a rocket launcher and hit a Veteran Patroller in the chest, knocking him over. The rest of the Patrollers charged the base-jim and took out most of the Kidpin's soldiers. All that remained was my son. They busted down the trashcan and shot him in the head with a NERF gun. He was confused long enough for the HP's to apprehend him.

What can I say. Like Father, like Son.

However, he didn't know he could blame one of his buddies while he went into the WPP."

irondal2,casualiama,1389068568.0,"I'm not a numbers freak, but I am skeptical, and I understand statistics. An all-inclusive study which shows that the number of women who live with an antisocial personality is fewer than the number of men living with antisocial personality might help me accept this sexist conclusion. There isn't a single study published that can offer proof that ""the amount of male sociopaths is much greater"" (than the amount of female sociopaths). This is just sexism! If it were possible to conduct a study that included every single person who lives with antisocial personality, then we would see no important difference.

I think this sexism is alarming, because of the way people are socialized in the Americas. Of course more male sociopaths wind up in the prison system and thus more males can be subjected to the testing that psychologists and psychiatrists can use to diagnose ASPD. However, I think that it's a slippery slope to ascribe the fundamental notion to sociopathy, or even to antisocial personality, that the conditions primarily manifest themselves through male behavior. We can't just assume that the behaviors of male prisoners being observed by mental health practitioners aren't also done by loads of women and men outside of the prison system (that aren't included in the research).

All the personality disordered patients where your colleague interned likely suffer from organic dysfunction as well, if the Canadian system is like ours. 
In the US sociopaths with just the ASPD diagnosis aren't considered insane. Here, the prisoners whose only mental illness is their antisocial personality do their time, and at the end of their sentence, the prisoners are allowed to leave from jail or prison. I think it's important to not only draw a distinction between insanity and ASPD, but also to draw the distinction between ASPD and sociopathy (Narcissists can be sociopaths without necessarily suffering from ASPD). Separate them from patients who, say, are bipolar sociopaths."
laefil,relationships,1389068573.0,"i don't think you should try to salvage this relationship. the way you're putting it, from your perspective, it sounds like she is not really emotionally invested in you. it sounds like though you have had good times together, she is not capable of truly associating herself as being ""intimate"" with you.

i think you should not try to contact her; it would be a feat on her part, because it removes her from responsibly being your friend. it sounds like a one-way relationship, honestly.

she did this to you in high school and it sounds like she's doing this to you now. maybe she and dan have something exclusive with each other that she doesn't want to share with you. i would be very suspicious of her behaviour. i don't think any ""depression"" is an excuse for this behaviour--someone who is mature and reliable should be able to apologise. if she's not willing to go into detail, that's fine, but you don't deserve to be her punching bag for it."

Looks like the best way to do that would be a [residential TSP loan](https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/loans/loanBasics.shtml), which lets you borrow against your TSP balance.  You then repay the loan with interest (interest rate = G fund rate when you apply) and the interest goes back into your TSP.  There's a $50 fee to process the application, and repayments are taken directly from your pay.  More details are on that page.  I'd talk with the TSP person wherever you work to be sure that's what you want to do, because my experience is limited to the Googling I just did.

From what I can tell, you can't withdraw your contributions to a Roth TSP at any time without penalty like you can with a Roth IRA.  There is a personal loan option, though.  Otherwise, if you withdraw before age 59.5, there seems to be a 10% penalty and some others.  I could be wrong about that, but that's what I was able to find.

I love alien blue and use it everyday but they should really put in a real setting that completely blocks all nsfw posts from viewing. Fortunately my Will power is strong enough to overcome all these urges. I've posted on the alien blue subreddit requesting for this setting to be added, so hopefully an update will come soon."
cptn_garlock,anime,1389070248.0,"I think it might be. Now, granted, because of the incredibly awkward translations on BT (although I suppose I shouldnt look a gift horse in the mouth, haha), it's sometimes difficult to understand what's going and that deters from our understanding of the series. If you're going to go down the LN route (which is further along than the manga), be prepared to do lots of re-reading to interpret awkward grammar. 

Honestly, I prefer the manga. The art style in that looks wonderful, whereas the anime seems pretty lazy. There's also a more crucial difference between the anime and manga - the latter portrays Koko in a more sympathetic light. A specific example would be [](/s ""when Koko slide tackles, and then confesses to, Banri on the bridge. In the manga, she goes into details about how she didn't want to make it seem like Banri was her rebound relationship, and thought a girl like her shouldn't be dating someone right after letting go off her crush of almost a decade. She even says it'd be fair to reject her, since she deserves it for rejecting him earlier. In the anime, though, they just have her say the answer is yes and then cut scene, which made it feel like she was just using Banri to deal with the loss of Yana, that she didn't really love him. The anime didn't convince she was being genuine until episode 12 when she deals with Banri ""cheating"" on her."")

So yeah, I think the source material is pretty solid. I think the major issues is that the director and screenwriter has put absolutely no effort into things, and neither did the animation department (even shit animation and art can look insane with the right level of creativity, as the early episodes of Kill la Kill showed.)

Stop standing up for the oil industry, they make trillions of dollars a year, and a share of that comes from the oil sands. If they weren't making any money off it, they wouldn't be pressing for further development. Standing up for the oil industry is like saying, for instance, that the yankees haven't won enough world series titles. I want all Albertans, along with all other Canadians, to prosperity.

I didn't consciously consider the consequences (or really much of anything) before slapping him, but I will admit that on a basic level I was pretty sure he'd never hit me back. And he didn't. I also didn't, like, slap him full-force or anything. He was mostly just shocked and offended.

It's certainly not something I make a habit of. I don't think I've done it first, though I had some odd friendships. And I'm sure I've accidentally hit people while doing stage combat and that kind of thing. Oh, and one time I kneed my ex in the crotch while we were play-wrestling.

I personally have always had threesomes with people from my social group but since you don't want to do that, take your boyfriend to a bar or some sort of social place, ask him to find someone he finds attractive and you two both start a conversation with that person, get to know them and see if they are a good fit. It doesn't have to happen right a way, in fact I would advise against that, get to know the person you are bringing into your bed room. 

as far as it goes during sex it never really ends up as 1 on 1 with 1 watching, just get into it. Or your guy will bring you into you. You just have to remember to be comfortable and let your inhibitions go. 

Now as far as after sex goes, really you can do what ever or set rules for what happens after.

Junk Badstuffs happens every once in a while when a drafter gets distracted or doesn't know what they're doing.

Pulse would come back around in my experience, so it's a safe pick to take the Arena first. As others have said, Arena and Lily are best friends."

When she asked if I did I lied and said not often (I was 13/14, it was daily) and she said good and that was that. Looking back it was odd that I felt I needed to keep it from her. If you enjoy masturbating and she isn't available to fulfill you as often as you would have masturbated, I'd suggest you talk to her and work things out.

vorpalblab,AskMen,1389072205.0,"I am not circumcised. 

My dad was a gynecologist. He thought it was a needless operation done mostly to inflate fees with the excuse that it prevented some infections due to poor hygiene.

I find that my inner foreskin is much more sensitive than the penis head and can be the source of very intense orgasms without involving any other part of the penis. It seems to me that it resembles the clitoris in sensitivity and location.

Perhaps circumcision was invented by women so the men could last longer? 

Or was it that men sacrificed the seat of sexual pleasure to please God. 

What a horrible god that would be, to create something, then love those who rip it off and throw it away just to prove solidarity with the guys that collect money from them every week for telling them what to think about god. If god wants you to know something, he can most likely go direct, with no appreciable effort. Being omniscient and omnipotent and everywhere and everywhen, world without end?

I don't really think this changes the issue. 3D printing has much more exposure and even if you ignore that, it would only make things worse. It would be another way to produce homemade guns.

And yes, I've thought of how ammo could become the real issue here, but I think that the simple fact of being able to easily create your own guns would make people who are excited about this try to get ammo by however means possible. The whole thing could be prevented if the person did not want a gun in first place.

So, basically, I don't think it needs to be considered a ""whole new problem"", but it is something that makes an already existing problem (much) worse (edit: as pointed out by the title, which says I'm scared of it becoming big. It already exists and will probably continue existing, I think it becomes a problem if suddenly thousands of people decide to make use of that).

And honestly, the book is different than The Hunger Games.  I admit, I didn't care for either the movie or book, as I felt it spoke to a much younger audience.  As an example, I like the fact that while the main characters won the game, they didn't really have a happy ending, as the government continued to exist, compared to The Hunger Games, where one person was able to make a difference and bring down the oppressive government.

sir_sri,politics,1389073695.0,"That would only work if you could get other countries to do the  same.  Right now US banks are, by international standards not even that big, particularly for a country the size of  the US.

Being small relative to your competitors puts you at a serious disadvantage, especially in international business.  

A lot of small regional banks could actually be a lot worse for the US particularly, because the US is essentially several different economic areas all glued together.  If you  are a customer at a Texas bank that makes most of it's money on  oil and oil investors and other texas assets, and suddenly there's a megastorm that  destroys lots  of value in Texas the bank still needs a bailout, because it couldn't spread the risk around.  If you're a bank that primarily does commercial banking in Florida and medicare gets cut and half your customers go bankrupt then the bank still needs a bailout.  

Big banks being able to make equally big bets is not necessarily a good thing.  But big  banks being able to make lots of small separate bets is really what you want the system to be, so they don't have to be bailed out when things go wrong.

Unfortunately, the practical reality of the world is also that 'too big to fail' doesn't necessarily mean that it's all that big.  A lot of small banks all imploding due to a major global economic shock is pretty much as bad as one big bank failing.  So the idea that the US had a lot of banks that were 'too big to fail' obscures the problem that relatively speaking most US banks aren't all that big.

Take the oil industry - if BP was a smaller company the 40 billion dollars in costs  due to the Deepwater horizon disaster would have bankrupted them and the government and private individuals would have been  stuck cleaning up the tab for the mess.  As it was, BP.... sold some minor assets to a couple of companies and reduced their profit margins for a couple of years and... that's pretty much that.

robdabank,lewronggeneration,1389074002.0,"Then (16): Started college after a really awkward high school period. Hadn't really permeated mainstream musical bubble. Few trips overseas made me sort of self-righteous about my musical tastes; French House (institubes/Ed Banger/Kitsune), and Hardstyle. That I grew up around Verdi, Philip Glass, and Musique Conrete. I was always on my high horse about how I disliked Top 40 stuff and hated how people always wanted to play it at parties.

Now (22): Substantially more receptive to music. Hip Hop and Rap are staples on my workout playlist and Gucci Mane never fails to make me smile. Less electronic music, more stuff I can chill out to. Make conscious efforts to try new albums weekly and get through them even if I don't like them. Still not fond of a lot of Top 40, but if it's playing at a bar or whatever I just drink until I enjoy it. Also, remixes make Top 40 better and it always seems to be a happy medium with people I meet who aren't into music.

Summary: 16 year old me was a douche about but I still think my musical tastes were pretty cool. I could have just gone without being a piece of shit about it."

cptn_garlock,anime,1389074039.0,"Well, part of it is the obnoxious protrayal of Haruyuki. I get that Kawahara wanted to emphasize the difference between his VR and real life forms by making them so starkly different, but the art-style truly is so bizarre that it's immersion breaking. 

The very obvious harem elements were not fun to watch, and again, quite immersion breaking. 

The second villian felt like I was watching a mustache twirling caricature from a 1920's silent film, except way rapier. He reminded me of the villain from SAO, which isn't a good comparison. 

Ultimately, I didnt feel like I gave a damn about the characters, I didn't feel like I gave a damn about Haruyuki in particular, and the fights never felt entertaining. Similarly, because the characters didn't resonate, the conflicts felt hollow; I was actively rooting for that brunette girl (the one who's into Haruyuki) to die in that car crash, just to see the kind of stress that'd put on Haruyuki and how he'd react to it. 

Honestly, I've read a lot of Kawahara's work, and unfortunately I found most of it rather juvenile and as if it were written by a high schooler (which, for some of them, is literally the case.) It's great that he seems to really like what he's writing...it's just too bad that I don't.

Contero,funny,1389074072.0,"No. An [established by federal law](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.pdf) requirement of unpaid internships is:

&gt; The employer that provides the training **derives no immediate advantage** from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded.

&gt; Under these circumstances the intern does not 
perform the routine work of the business on a regular and recurring basis, and the business is not dependent 
upon the work of the intern. On the other hand, if the interns are engaged in the operations of the employer or 
are performing productive work (for example, filing, performing other clerical work, or assisting customers), 
**then the fact that they may be receiving some benefits in the form of a new skill or improved work habits will 
not exclude them from the FLSA’s minimum wage** and overtime requirements because the employer benefits 
from the interns’ work.

To put what /u/alaysian said again:

Unpaid internships **by law** have to have no value.

If you've done an unpaid internship where your employer made money off of your work, then what they were doing was illegal."

I also question the role of Sakura in the story, as that was some insane and unbelievable turn around in terms of disposition towards Mirai.

 Honestly, I made it through those episodes partially on hype alone and partially because the animation is fucking gorgeous. However, I took a break from it, and then later read how the show ended from other people who's opinion I trust and tend to share tastes with, and it wasn't a promising ending.

robdabank,chelseafc,1389074927.0,"&gt; Best Upset / Revenge

The best revenge was probably the reverse fixture against United at Old Trafford in May of 2013. 

After the abortion of a game that was played in October 2012 where we were down to 9 men by the 65th minute, and had clawed back to an even 2-2 we lost 3-2. Clattenburg did a shit job of refereeing and everyone knew it.

Fast forward to a near capacity crowd at Old Trafford, May 5th 2013.

0-0 until deep in the second half and [Juan Mata puts us ahead in the 87th minute](http://youtu.be/mmk4Z0MyXy4).

Definitely the best revenge we had all season. United shit in our house, and then we shit in theirs.

gingerkid1234,linguistics,1389074958.0,"&gt;I suppose that this depends on what you mean when you say grammatical. One could define grammatical as something acceptable for a particular person's grammar (and from a syntactic theory perspective I think it's fairly important that you do so).

Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

&gt;I come at this from a contact variety POV where something that's both acceptable in a contact variety and comprehensible in an ambient language is classified as grammatical. Many instances of such pedantry seem to be ignorant of such issues (e.g., targeted at L2 English, creoles with English lexicons, different dialects ,etc).

But there are some things that are comprehensible and *not* part of a contact variety.  ""I are going"" isn't grammatical in any variety, but in a contact situation it's comprehensible.  That's what I'm talking about--even in a contact situation, there are things that are ungrammatical in every variety, and are thus ungrammatical, even if they're comprehensible."

gnusounduave,AskReddit,1389075030.0,"You got it, pull up a chair and let me begin.  *cracks knuckles*

The year 1997, the place Alexandria, Louisiana, and to be more specific it was the corner of Bayou Rapides Rd and Macarthur Drive.  This fucking [Mobile Station](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=bayou+rapides+and+macarthur+drive+alexandria,+la&amp;ll=31.304951,-92.48015&amp;spn=0.000018,0.013078&amp;sll=31.304937,-92.480152&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,188.4,,0,8.27&amp;cbll=31.304951,-92.48015&amp;hnear=Bayou+Rapides+Rd+%26+MacArthur+Dr,+Alexandria,+Rapides,+Louisiana+71303&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=YfxVQNNUB2iKEsj5wBu5Mg) right here.

I had a friend that worked there pulling graveyard shifts every single night.  Why, I dunno.  Maybe he just liked being secluded, maybe he was somewhat anti social, but thinking back I believe it was because he was a pot head.  Now this guy was educated, he had an undergrad degree in Biology, but he was just so damn quirky in his own right.  Not that I judged him or anything because he was a decent and cool guy to shoot the shit with.  Anyway, I was working at Ballbuster Video at the time and I was the closing manager so every night after I got off I would stop at that store to pick up a beer or to and hang out with my buddy.  He didn't give a shit if I drank my 22oz beers, inside the store, while I would keep him company for an hour or so at best.  This night was just like any other night until things just went to total shit.

I walk in the store, see my buddy behind the counter, he gives me the usual wave and I scan the store to see if anybody is inside.  Nope, the coast is clear, time to get my beer.  Now I was of legal age to purchase the beer but I wanted to make sure nobody was around when the legal transaction takes place and I promptly twist off the cap to my 22oz bud light and begin to pound it down.  I bring my two 'double deuces' to the counter to purchase them as per my usual fashion and strike up the usual banter with my friend of ""how are ya doing tonight?""  The reply is the standard, ""i'm doing fine.""

This is an important part that I need to get out of the way because it will play an important part in this story.  This business has two entrances inside.  A double door in the front that faces out towards the pumps and a second single door on the side of the building that they lock after it gets to whatever time they determine.  When customers would drive up to the pumps, that late at night, you had to walk inside the store to pre pay your fucking gas.  I would always park my happy ass with my back towards the locked door, on the side, and hide my brewhaha's next to the icee machines as the customers entered the premises.

Typical Friday or Saturday night I don't remember which but as usual some teenagers, about two cars deep, pull up to the pumps and I expect these people to come inside to whip out some cold hard cash to pay for their gas.  These fuckers come inside, my double deuces are already stashed, and they cruise down the isles looking for snacks while their other friends are checking out the soft drinks.  Then ass hat shows up on a bike.  Ass hat pulls up next to the doors, disembarks his trusty metal steed, and enters this fine establishment like any other normal person would.  Did I have cause for concern?  Nah, why would I?  I mean this guy looked like any other person and besides, he went straight to the coolers and picked up some OJ and was making his way to the register.  This is where things take a turn, hold on, let me take a swig from my beer and I'll continue.

Lawd Jeefus I got's me a cold beer right hur.  Little bits of ice floating in it and all.  Yeah, well, back to the story.

So the teenagers are at the counter paying for their shit, some pay and leave, others pay and kind of hang out next to the counter waiting on god knows what, and now it's time for ass hat to take his place at bat.  This guy walks up, slides his OJ on the counter, my buddy *beep beep beep* rings it up and tells him his total.  Ass hat reaches into his pocket and pulls out a few bills.  The register opens *DING* and ass hat lunges over the counter and into the till.  My buddy simply reacts as his slight portly stomach lurches towards the till, hits it, and the drawer closes catching the finger tips off ass hat in it.  Ass hat reels back in pain shaking his fingers before he decides to reach under his jacket and pull out, what looked like, a 9mm semi automatic pistol and point it directly towards my friend.  Teenagers, guys and girls alike, dash behind the counter screaming and trembling while I'm left sticking out like a sore thumb in the corner.  I stand still.

Now I knew something that ass hat didn't know, something that nobody besides me and my friend knew, but he always had a piece behind the counter.  I'm left thinking, ""fuck a good old fashioned standoff.""  My buddy looks at me like he wants approval to pull out his piece or something.  I'm thinking don't do it because what happens if you miss and he shoots you.....i'm fucking next bro.  I shake my head no at him, he is shaking his head yes, and i'm still going NO!  Ass hat notices me!!

Now I'm sure he is just ever so slightly pissed off at the fact that he didn't get any money and his fingers were still burning at getting caught in the till but he decides to side step a few paces and get in my face.  Now what happens here next I will never know the reasons but this is where I thought I was going to die.

He extends his weapon directly in front of my face and I am looking straight down the barrel.  I can see him breathing hard as i'm watching his nostrils flare and my eyes drift back to the business end of his weapon.  It's bouncing ever so slightly with the rhythm of his breath but it really doesn't matter.  Inhale shoot, exhale shoot, either way I'm a fucking dead man because it's that close.  So you're asking yourself right now, ""OMG Gnusounduave what did you do?  I would have totally been like man up bitch imma save the fucking day.""  I did the least threatening thing I could possibly do in that situation and I looked down at the floor and away from his face.  I didn't want to be a threat to him because he had the upper hand and I wanted to live to fight another day.

So there I was, teenagers screaming behind the counter, I'm wondering if this prick is going to evacuate my cranial cavity, and I'm standing between a fucking icee machine and scratch off lottery tickets.  At that moment I thought to myself, ""man what a fucking way to go.""  He seemed determined and I thought he was going to do it out of spite for what my buddy did to his fingers.  I stood there just looking at the ground and my eyes burning a hole in his shoes.

Whelp, obviously he didn't shoot, because I mean I'm here telling you this story.  But what he did do, was slowly lower his weapon after what seemed like forever; it might have been two or three minutes of tense ass clinching fear but he simply walked away.  I honestly think that had I been some type of ""what are you gonna do fucker?  shoot me?"" That he would have shot me dead for sure.

So there ya go, now i'm gonna go finish this beer and just hang tight."

I too like dildos which outsize my male partners, because the dildo is not as much fun by far, so it has to make up for *its inadequacies*.

Guys who have not had sex with other guys really don't understand penetrative sex. Size is an important quality but it doesn't outstrip all the others. As long as you're not *way* too small or *way* too big, you have a perfectly good penis.

I guess the easiest way I could explain it is, would you feel inadequate about other features of the dildo? Would you feel bad that your dick isn't perfectly straight? That it doesn't have big plastic bumps? That it isn't see-through?"

stephengee,knifeclub,1389076161.0,"The problem is your technique, not the knife(probably). I find it much easier to actually put my thumb tip through the hole, but it can be done both ways. 

Its sort of similar to a manual flipper, you build up pressure by pressing against the detent and you will get a strong flip each time. Since a lock back has no detent, you apply pressure almost straight towards the pivot, rather that outwards with the rotation of the blade(as you did in your video). Push towards the pivot so the blade doesn't open, then shift outwards so you unload that tension in your thumb in one burst. 

Its almost the same idea as snapping your fingers. If you just try and clap your finger tip to your palm, no snap. If you build up pressure against your thumb first though, you can release that force over a much shorter time.

Wouldn't that square well with ideas of humans as depraved/needing of atonement?  I mean, nothing says ""humans are fallen"" like being essentially an animal.

&gt;I am a human being made in the image of God, not a beast.

Why not both?  God creates humans in Genesis 1 on the 6th day together with land animals.

&gt;The reason why we reject Common Descent is because the Bible says ""By one man sin entered the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."" (Romans 5:12) This clearly shows that Adam and Eve were real.

Evolution being true doesn't imply Adam and Eve weren't real.

&gt;Ask for the Holy Spirit to give you discernment in this issue. He did for me and He'll do the same for you if you ask Him and seek Him out. This is vital.

ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1389076938.0,"Maybe you should read more psychology literature. What is ""solid scientifically"" is that IQ is considered very problematic because what it measures is not well defined. Effectively, IQ only measures itself, and 'intelligence' is not well-defined in a biological sense, or really any sense which contains no cultural bias.

It's a good measurement for certain things. Measure the IQ of children and teens in Western countries and it's an *statistical* indicator for wealth etc. I make that distinction because I don't have faith in Redditors' ability to distinguish statistical and deterministic indicators.

But the problem is that wealthier *populations* tend to have higher IQ. If IQ measures something biological, then you'd expect it to follow the genetic trend - which would be differences only at the outliers, but otherwise greater variation within populations than between them. That's not the case; IQ doesn't correspond to any biological measure that we're aware of. That's a pretty big problem."

I dunno, Disney isn't exactly known for subtlety, you know? Even though these are just concepts and aren't even affiliated with Disney, I think they fit the brand a lot better than a very sleek, sophisticated design. I mean, they're Disney villains.

8lueberrymuffin,AskReddit,1389077604.0,"Considering this has already made front page.. this comments probably going to get lost in the comments but even if this reaches one person hopefully I can help you to a successful relationship. 

My gf of 7 years just broke up with me last month did everything by the book and I did my best to be the best person I could ever be was faithful loyal and endearing but sometimes things just aren't to be. Hopefully I can shed some wisdom and help someone out there.

* 1.) As cliche as it is.. do not go to bed mad. Dragging fights over several days is just not healthy on the relationship.. 
* 2.) FFS be a man and take responsibility when you do something wrong. Don't go hours beating around the bush and try to turn the argument around on your spouse.
* 3.) Put yourself in their shoes. Would you appreciate your gf flirting with a hottie at a club.. probably not. Then don't do it... 
* 4.) Check in.. honestly a text message here and there.. a call every now and then really can't hurt. Takes less than a minute to sms your spouse... 'hey i'm going with X to Y... I'll call you later.."" etc..
* 5.) A gift out of the blue even something as simple as her favorite chocolate bar.. a single rose.. can mean a lot. 
* 6.) If you have a problem.. speak up don't sit there and brood.. and for fuck sake don't go running off to talk to your ex or girl friends.. talk to your spouse..
* 7.) Some things are just not worth fighting about...
* 8.) Venting about your spouse to your friends is not a good idea. You may forgive your spouse.. but they never will. (Addendum: Venting to your spouse about your best friends.. might have the same effect.. My advice? vent to reddit.. lol)
* 9.) More on 8.. Seeking advice from single friends can easily leave u with an empty bed. Some of the worst decisions I've made were from taking advice from single friends.. They just don't get it. They never will. They can't relate.. and they'll just never understand..
* 10.) Commitment. To your spouse, to your friends and family. You can't be everywhere at once.. you'll never be able to keep everyone happy.. If you make plans.. stick to it. If you break plans you better damn well make up for them. If you start alienating someone they're going to resent you and whoever you are spending that time with. 
* 11.) Learn to agree even though you disagree. Especially if it is in reference to some girls actions or attributes. You can save yourself a fight. Early in the relationship I use to always defend some girls honor.. this always lead to arguments and fights (at least this was the case for me). 
* 12.) It's all fun and games to make fun of each other when you are alone. Try to refrain from picking on your gf amongst friends and peers. You're suppose to have each others backs.. Nor should you really be giving your friends material to make fun of your spouse..
* 13.) Being in a super long term relationship.. This is something I learnt after the break up. Address the elephant in the room. That fucker keeps getting bigger and bigger.

travelingmama,changemyview,1389078309.0,"&gt;the only morally justifiable system. 

The problem with this statement, and maybe it has already been pointed out, is that the way universal healthcare is enforced, at the very core makes it immoral because it is implemented by the use of force. The only way for healthcare to be moral is if it is completely voluntary system. Of course in the US, it's not moral the way it is currently run because we are forced to have health insurance. The most moral place I've seen is this free market surgery center in Oklahoma. Their costs are low because they don't take insurance at all, all their prices are posted online, and they don't have any overhead costs. No hospital administration fees, they don't over charge for supplies, etc. If you want to look at something that is truly moral, this is it. http://www.surgerycenterok.com/"

YoungFolks,asktransgender,1389078747.0,"&gt;To put it simply, every foetus starts as female, when turning into a male it is a two step process in which the body is masculinized by an initial surge of testosterone and the brain is masculinized by a secondary and separate surge of testosterone. If there are hormonal abnormalities within the womb which prevent this secondary surge from being effective, the baby is born with a female brain that is supposed to receive oestrogen but attached to a body that is producing testosterone.

Let's not pretend that humans did not consume berries, eggs, nuts, and the like in addition to meat before agriculture started, either. We took a while to properly domesticate plants, but that doesn't mean we didn't eat them.

The 3 main sources of calories are Carbs, Fats, and Proteins (~4cal/g, ~9cal/g, and ~4cal/g respectively). Mass gain is caused by eating more calories than you burn. To gain muscle or fat (aka mass), you need to eat a caloric surplus. Your protein powder is just food -- a source of protein -- think of it like eating a chicken breast.

Techniques for things like ant fishing in chimps, or sponging in dolphins (both technologies, in the barest sense) are not genetic, but culturally transmitted - the second way behavior is passed on through generations. As smart as one octopus is, because they are not social or have close contact with their offspring, their ""ideas"" gain no traction.

Do they need to be some sort of ultra-co-operative goody two shoes? No. But they do need to be social. Otherwise techniques invented by one member of a species die with them. 

But don't pretend like humans are the only species to ever achieve something through co-operation. We have multiple examples of culturally transmitted ""technologies"" in tool use in other species.

(I'm with you on convergent evolution, though I do think another species would have to be social and have cultural transmission in order to get anywhere with technology. Even birdsong is culturally transmitted.)"

23skiddsy,worldnews,1389080405.0,"Reciprocity and reciprocal altruism are hardly unique to us. Vampire bats show it and have their own ""moral"" system in a tit-for-tat arrangement - I help you now, that's an investment in you (or others that observe me as a helper) helping me later. Those that don't follow that rule are identified by the rest of the group as ""cheaters"" and they don't get help when they ask for it.

""Morality"" tends to be selected for in any social species. A fish that bites at cleaner fish will not get cleaned because they didn't obey the ""rules"". And those rules are beneficial to many, but breaking the rules can result in a loss of fitness. 

If it increases fitness in humans, why do you think it does not do so in other species? We can see it clearly in fish. We just tend to think our ""ethics"" and ""morals"" are above the social rules endemic to any social species (or relations between symbiotic species).

Minor edit: You probably wouldn't see funerary cannibalism because it's generally deselected for, as it's a really good way to get diseases and parasites. Kuru (a nasty prion disorder - same sort of disorder as mad cow disease), for instance, only really occurs in some regions of Paupa New Guinea - the Fore tribe specifically - because funerary cannibalism of the brain is part of the culture - it's the only transmission of it. Presuming life on other planets still have disease and parasites, cannibalism (of adults) will be discouraged by evolution. It could be socially encouraged (as in the Fore tribe), but it will never be pushed by evolution as long as eating a conspecific is a good way to get sick."

We didn't have an open bar, but had 2 domestic beers and a cocktail hour, plus soda, wine at dinner, coffee, and juice.

A taco bar at a wedding that you plan to spend almost $30,000 on is extremely tacky. The people attending your wedding are the people who you care about the most, don't you want to show them a good time?

Maybe you should be rethinking the way you look at your wife, with how you say ""she's too good for."" My mom's last husband had that same attitude and they're now divorced. Personally, I think you're being very unreasonable. $29,500 is not a frugal wedding, so I don't think you're going to get the advice that you are looking for. And if *one* person agrees with you, versus the masses that are disagreeing with you, don't take that as an ""I am absolutely right"" answer.

And to those of you that actually read this, if you're getting married around Green Bay, PM me and I will tell you all about my ridiculously amazingly cheap wedding reception so you know a nice place to go. $19 a person included the drinks I mentioned above, plus family style dinner and a pizza buffet halfway through the reception.

Also, the fish oil route, while still being sourced *from* fish, almost certainly gets more oil per fish than cooking and eating them does; which means that you're essentially causing the deaths of fewer fish per year by getting it in that more efficient manner. 

At which point, you're down to ""I'd rather eat the fish directly because it's less gross"", and that's completely fine with me - but I genuinely think that from an ethical standpoint that's no different from my decision to eat any other given animal. In both cases one is choosing to do a thing which causes greater harm for reasons of convenience of personal enjoyment. 

(At the end of the day, I don't really think it's ethically defensible for people to eat *any* animals if they can afford the foods and supplements which allow a person to live a healthy and well-nourished life; but I'm willing to live with the fact that not following through with that makes me something of a hypocrite. Animals are delicious and I guess I'm not as good a person as I could be.)

When you moved in, did the agent place your deposit in a tenancy deposit scheme? They should have informed you of the details. If they didn't, then they also broke the law and are not entitled to withhold any of your deposit.

https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection/if-your-landlord-doesnt-protect-your-deposit

If you do find they haven't secured the deposit, then you have a lot of leverage to get what you need. The threat of having to pay 4 times the deposit back to you as compensation is quite a strong one!

The laws protecting tenants are quite strong. Read up on them before you get tricked again. Many landlords and agents prey on immigrants who do not understand our laws or are in a big hurry to find a place."

BananasGoMoo,promos,1389082831.0,"/u/OriginInsider : you likely won't read this or respond to it, but I'll just give my honest opinion, and not just bash your company like most of the other people here:

I really like games made by EA. Spore was a great game imo, and I got all of the Sims 1 and Sims 3 expansion packs (not the stupid ""stuff"" packs, but that story is for a different time). Mirror's edge is one of my favorite games of all time. Other games I enjoy include: Plants vs Zombies and SimCity 4.

Now, onto the problem: Origin.  Its not that Origin is a bad platform (in fact I have no idea, since I don't use it for anything). The problem is, your newer games are ONLY available on Origin. This is a problem because every game I own digitally is on Steam. I am NOT going to download ANOTHER platform just to play 1 or 2 games. I really want to play Mirror's Edge 2, but after the Sims 3, all your games have been Origin exclusives. I probably speak for many people when I say this, that I would be very willing to buy and play your games if I could get them on Steam. 

Example: I REALLY wanted to get the newest SimCity (yes, the one with a terrible launch), but I didn't because it was not easily available on Steam.

This is one of the things people mean when they say ""EA is a bad company"" (I could talk about other things EA does that isnt ""consumer-friendly"" but that was not the point of the post).

Thanks, if you read this.

PS: Suggestion to get more Steam users to actually, ya know, USE Origin: make it so if I am on Origin, I can still chat with my Steam friends (Maybe integrate steam login API into Origin?) That would certainly make ME more likely to ever use Origin. 
Another good way to get users to join Origin: Make your games cheaper on Origin than anywhere else. So say Steam puts Sims 3 on sale for 50% off, yours should be 60%, for example. "

&gt; or as they now call it Climate Change

Who do, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, founded in 1988? Yes, they do. Not sure why you say ""now"" about a 25-year-old organisation, using a term that's been in the scientific literature for decades before.

Unless of course you mean wider media adoption of the term? You can thank Republican media strategist [Frank Luntz](https://www2.bc.edu/~plater/Newpublicsite06/suppmats/02.6.pdf) for that - just part of his efforts in 2002 to downplay the severity of the problem, by using less scary language.

&gt; “Climate change” is less frightening than “global warming.” As one focus group  participant noted, climate change “sounds like you’re going from Pittsburgh to  Fort Lauderdale.” While global warming has catastrophic connotations attached  to it, climate change suggests a more controllable and less emotional challenge.

[...]

&gt; Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate.

[...]

&gt; The scientific debate is closing [against us] but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science.

[...]

&gt; You need to be even more active in recruiting experts who are sympathetic to your view, and much more active in making them part of your message. 

[...]

&gt; WORDS THAT WORK 
&gt; “Scientists can extrapolate all kinds of things from today’s data, but that doesn’t tell us anything about tomorrow’s world. You can’t look back a million years and say that proves that we’re heating the globe now hotter than it’s ever been. After all, just 20 years ago scientists were worried about a new Ice Age.”

Just don't stop doing what you're doing just to listen to them. Do you, you're on your path, no need to get out your way. But when situations arise where you have no choice, fuck it, let em vent. You can actually learn something, and it can help you with taking women down off the pedestal.

Then offer advice, but in a charming way of course. 

I have a friend who's pretty attractive, but she's fat and her personality a little on the masculine side. Skin, hair, face, all on point. If she lost a solid 30 pounds she'd be beautiful. Great to have as a bro, terrible for romantic pursuit. Anyhoo.

She caught me one day on the phone and told me about how she can't really secure a great relationship. I listened to her nonsense, and then told her what was up.

I started with ""Listen my child, I like you so I'll enlightened you."" I liked this because it puts me in the frame I want to be in, and it's funny to me. Told her exactly how to solve her problem and ended it with ""There, you're welcome. Most people pay a small fortune for timeless wisdom like this, but I only require you to get me a beer and shut your trap.""

twelvis,Anticonsumption,1389084109.0,"Sounds great, except how do you preserve bulk perishable goods before they're sold? Some packaging is there for a reason. Every wonder why you see ""sealed for safety"" lids? Moreover, huge amounts of goods would end up exactly like our current incredibly wasteful supply chain of produce. Something like 50% of produce never makes it to human mouths. At some point, you'd be trading one type of waste for another. I have no idea if it's worse to create packaging waste or food waste. Also, increased waste = increased price.

Also, consider your teabags as an example. At present, you've got to buy a set amount of teabags. The margins on groceries are razor thin as is. Stores have to sell as much as they can. The sale is already made when you enter the store. That's just the reality of their business. If you allowed people to buy smaller amounts, your gross sales would likely plummet even you offered bulk discounts. How does the grocery store deal with a double-digit drop in tea sales besides jacking up the price, which further decreases sales? It's not financially sustainable.

Furthermore, there's already bulk dry goods sold in almost every grocery store in North America. This is where your idea *might* work: allow people to bring their own containers. Of course, this may run afoul of health standards. Worse, legal issues: customer uses dirty container, buys food, gets sick, sues grocer. Also, I'm willing to bet only a small fraction of a grocery's gross sales comes from bulk foods--it's precisely the packaged processed crap that makes them money.

Beyond avoiding processed heavily packaged foods and actively buying local produce, I'm not sure there's a lot you can do."

stacks of flesh heap don't matter. heartstopper aura drains enemy hp at the same rate regardless of how much health or magic resistance they have.

second, it's important to mention that maxing heartstopper aura first is almost always a bad idea. yes, it can crush lanes, but you'll be useless for a large portion of the game afterward. it's not worth it, one level is enough. maxing death pulse is actually better against pudge. if he hooks you, you can heal yourself and damage him at the same time

The Delerium Noel glass is what I bring to tastings because it's small, cool looking, and it's thick so it doesn't break easily. The Gray Cloud glass is nice and thick too.

The Bruery glasses are great but so thin I would never take them out of the house. I dropped one once and glass shards were everywhere. I still find a random shard once in a while and that was 3 years ago.

That Goose Island glass holds a full pint, which is awesome. I don't like Stella Artois but I got that glass for free and it's a great glass.

Feel free to meet with different agents until you find the one you like. Especially when you're new to the home buying process, a good agent who can explain everything to you is very critical!

Same thing goes for your mortgage lender. Definitely shop around and ask them lots of questions!

In terms of websites, I mainly used [HAR](http://www.har.com) to browse around. After having a good idea of what I was looking for, I found an agent who showed me a few houses that didn't pop up on my search. I found the house I ended up buying by driving around. I was showing one of the houses I had previously viewed to a friend and decided to drive around the block. Sure enough, an even better home was literally right around the corner!

If there isn't fiber back haul available the site can't go live on 4G either, so it has to wait for the back haul provider to go out, trench it to the cell site, and create a demarcation point.

I think it's something like 50% of all Sprint cell sites have LTE at this point, 83% of all Sprint cell sites have some sort of work accepted on them as of 01/01/14.

badmotherfuhrer,FanFiction,1389087762.0,"A word of advice: stories about OC trainers starting their journey to collect gym badges are a dime a dozen. What you need to do is find some premise for your story that fits at least one of two niches: something you like fantasizing about, and something that's relatively undone. 

When I say relatively, I mean that you can use a premise that's been done before, as long as it's done well. I find that people will always read stories with good plot *and* good characterizations, so you don't need to reinvent the wheel. 

Additionally, everybody has their preferences. I happen to not like OC stories at all, and I know plenty of people that can't get enough. So if all else fails, you'll find *someone* to read your story. You probably won't get bouquets of roses in the mail seeing as it's your first time, but right now, you just need to get your foot in the door. Best way to do that is, again, to find something you like writing about, and/or something that's not too terribly common. I can't really help you with the first, but I can with the second.

A good exercise to get your juices flowing about what's uncommon is to think about the Pokémon world in a different way. What is day-to-day life *really* like? Obviously, not everyone can be a professional trainer, otherwise nobody would be garbagemen, or accountants, or the President. How do Pokémon fit into these jobs? Do they help? Do they hinder? 

Try to think about your own daily life as well. You still probably go to school, so how would Pokémon fit into school life? Are they considered pets? Are Pokémon capable of getting detention? Think about how these things would work in a real-world setting, and try to build your world around that.

When you've got a pretty good idea of how you want your world to operate, think about an adventure Vincent might have in this world. This doesn't have to be *the* adventure, the one you want to write and publish, but it's a good idea to think about how he might react to certain things happening in this world you've built. 

Obviously, you want Vincent and Haley to go on a relatively odd adventure (otherwise you wouldn't have the story focus on them), so once you have a handle on their reactions to certain things, get writing! Pick a direction to go, and see where it takes your heroes. 

Last piece of advice I have is to *stick with it*. You might get tired of writing the same story for very long. Don't be afraid to switch it up if you don't like the direction. That's what editing is for. 

Hope this helps. Feel free to PM me if you want to describe your thoughts in detail.

Pension is simply this - 4.5% of your salary is deducted each month and put in an account.  Your school then matches that using their own money.  So every month your pension account gets 9% of your salary deposited into it.  You do not have a choice of paying into it or not, and why would you say no to it?

These are the deductions that you will have every month.  Say you get paid 2.1:  tax - 23089, pension (4.5%) - 94500, insurance I think is around 3% or so.  No other deductions should be included."

My thought processes and thus the way I naturally speak are drastically different so everything I say needs to be translated. I need to fake my reactions to things most of the time, mine are just different. I need to suppress pain and annoyance, things that seem normal to other people can wreck havoc with my senses.

Which I think is ridiculous because when they go to work, they don't see the kids anyway. When they go to daycare it'll be at the same time they work.

My dad is kind of mean to my stepmom sometimes, and so is my stepmom's mom. I think that's also a factor, and she just seems miserable sometimes. "

BonzoTheBoss,AskScienceFiction,1389089947.0,"I think the Universal Translator (UT) is a vastly under-appreciated piece of technology in how advanced it really is. Since the development of modern neuro-scanning techniques, most UTs are equipped with a built in scanner and powerful microprocessor to actively scan a conversations participants and derive the intended meaning and context of the words to be translated.

This is why certain words are left untranslated, because the person talking didn't *want* those words to be translated. I think what you may be referring to are times when we see Worf speak of various Klingon institutions (such as the ""Yan-Isleth"", The Brotherhood of the Sword) or weapons. 

This is because Worf has a very deep seated respect for the Klingon people and their ways. He does not want his words to lose their meaning or impact by just letting the UT translate everything, so he makes a conscious effort to say things in Klingon so he can then elaborate on their meaning himself."

One of the reasons is that we tend to get attached to the characters, and we will be actually worried about them dying or what else might happen to them. So when we know what will happen, we're able to relax and take in the rest of the details and plot more than if we're on edge waiting to see what happens to our favorite character.

I've noticed this myself, when things seem to be leading to a certain conclusion, I find myself not noticing as many details and focusing entirely on ""what's going to happen to this character"" or ""I hope he doesn't die""

Having been in a fraternity, I can tell you that the vast majority of almost-fights I've seen (we did a good job keeping our parties under control) was while alcohol was involved.

Being graduated and employed, I generally don't go to places were people get overly drunk (Have a few drinks, yes, but not get wasted), so I don't see ~~a lot of~~ any people trying to start fights.

Being really big and muscular helps deter fights. Otherwise, keep an eye out for people that look like they could be trouble. Being drunk is the number one indicator. If they look like they might be pissed off about something (that confrontational look you mentioned), they could be looking for an excuse to start something. Steer clear of them.

Remember, standing your ground is not worth getting hurt or arrested, seriously, in a bar full of drunks, its your word against theirs. Often they will kick you both out and if the police show up, they arrest both of you.

We will see more and more distributed computing as we're seeing with these individualized ""device"" capabilities.

BlueCarrotAntenna,europe,1389093633.0,"I don't necessarily agree. I mean, oil industry will exist outside of Norway even when Norwegian oil resources are gone, and Norwegians are by nature not hesitant to relocate for work. Most people who work in the oil industry are engineers, people with higher education and many years of experience. If they lose their jobs, they're not just going to sit at home moping collecting welfare. It's not the same situation as getting a huge amount of unemployed students or people who can't find work due to no education whatsoever.

What more, these people aren't going to all lose their jobs at once, it's going to be a gradual decrease. This means that Norway won't suddenly have 20% unemployment and no prospects.

Norway will certainly have a more rough time after the oil is gone, but given the strong economy outside of oil, the oil fund and considering that vast majority of Norwegians do not actually work in the oil sector, I'd say that it will still be better off than majority of EU. Whether or not EU will become a tempting option for other than purely financial reasons is not something anyone can safely predict I think, but I highly doubt that lack of oil alone will motivate Norway to join the union."

g0ldent0y,asktransgender,1389093715.0,"I understand how much we as transgender put emphasis on beauty standards, or what we think beauty is. We have an imprinted picture of what beauty means in the gender we desire to be. In my own experience, we tend to perceive male and female differences in an extreme way (that is due to dysphoria i guess).

But cis people do not tend to perceive it as extreme as we do. There are some, that do, sure. And to those it will always be hard to pass. But those people are rare. Most people just assume, that we are the gender we represent. Some of us are not beautiful, sure. But that doesn't keep us from passing.

Transition isn't about being attractive. It took me a while now, to understand this. Transition is about being confident in who you are. If you are not confident in being a woman, even one, that doesn't hold your own beauty standards, than what is the point of transitioning. You will always feel like shit, if you do. Lower your beauty standards, or do not transition. The second is no option for me, because the dysphoria is making me feel like a pile of shit. So i went with the lower standard.

Look at my pictures, i do not pass on any of those. I'm still not on hormones. BUT i pass in real life, and rarely get clocked. I even get hit on from cis males. That is due to me not giving a shit about beauty anymore, and just being confident in who i am. I am a woman. Not the most beautiful woman ever. BUT a woman. And therefore, people see me as a woman.

And if someone clocks me, that isn't the end of the world. It happens, get used to it. And i never had a negative experience with being clocked (like harrasment or such)."

Because if I invite a person to dinner, I, personally, do not expect them to pay because I invited them.

phaqueue,wow,1389094396.0,"This is especially important as a hunter...

Pay attention to your surroundings. As a hunter, you will want to be backed away from the mobs you're fighting instead of in melee range, when you're doing this, pay attention to what's around you, ran a group with a newbie hunter the other day who used the ability that makes them jump backwards (I forget the name, disengage maybe?) right into a pack of mobs we were trying to skip...

The group didn't get angry, but we had to explain that situational awareness is important.

This extends to your pet as well. Learning to control your pet as a hunter is a quite important, especially if you're skipping mobs in dungeons (as many groups tend to do)

Probably my best recommendation is to run plenty of dungeons as you level, try to run each one at least once (queue for them specifically if you don't get them as random). Treat those dungeons as a chance to learn. Play around with your spec and see what you like, realize that in leveling dungeons, you're likely not going to be top DPS since a lot of people will have heirlooms, instead play around with your abilities and learn what they do, how to use them, which ones and what kind of style you like playing.

Ignore the idiots in LFG/LFR who will call you a scrub, tell you to gtfo, etc. The people you should listen to are the ones who say things like ""let me show you how to do this"" or ""the best way to do x is this"". They're the ones you can actually learn something from.

johnothetree,WritingPrompts,1389094884.0,"It's been just over 2 years since my first memory was sold off. After the family business got shut down, I've been low on cash, looking for anything to get me by. Odd jobs here, plasma donations there, even selling most of my clothes couldn't help ends meet. Nobody wants to hire a man in his 70's. 

Walking into the clinic, she walks right up to me, overly happy as usual. ""Welcome back Mr. Olsen! What can I do for you today?"" To be honest, I did like her, the receptionist, at one point. Easy on the eyes, and rather nice, but it's hard to appreciate anything that's from this place anymore. 

*I love you*

""End of the month, you know why I'm here,"" I reply in my normal monotone voice. My voice had changed significantly in the past few years, I'm told. Side effect of the memory loss is what the clinic always says. Side effect of the dull pain in my head at all times is what I say.

""Let me get the doctor and you'll be in and out within 15 minutes as usual,"" she states, bouncing off to the back room.

*I love you*

I take a seat in the uncomfortable chairs in the waiting room. One of the regulars is there, sitting across the room. We used to talk whenever we'd see each other here. Only friendly nods exchange now.

Another guy is here too. Reading through a pamphlet in his hands, I can tell it's his first time. Always the worst. Shaky, nervous, not sure what memory you're comfortable letting go of first.

""Mr. Olsen?"" I hear. Doctor's standing in the doorway with a clipboard in hand. She smiles as I get up, and we walk into the back room to plug me into the machine. 

*I love you*

I never liked losing my memories. The worst is that I know I had them there. I can feel an emptiness in my head where thoughts should be, but there's nothing. Just a hole where something should be. I only know my parents existed because I had to bury them. I only know my kids are alive because I can see them crying when I told them she was dying. 

She.

I can't even remember her name anymore. I know I loved her. I know she was beautiful. I know she was perfect. But I can't remember her, the feel of her hand, the smell of her hair, what she looked like, what she wore. I can't remember anything. The last time I was here, I lost the memory of our wedding. The last image I had left of her, gone for a piece of plastic I could use to buy groceries.

Hooked up to the machine, I look over at the doctor, who's waiting for the cue to start the machine. After a thumbs up, I hear it humming. I guess this is it, the last memory I have of her.

5..... Tears start rolling.

4..... For a moment, I feel her with me.

3..... Her voice still here.

AnotherCrazyOne,technology,1389094994.0,"I have to say this is the first CES keynote I wished I could have watched. I was viewing the live blog on ARS. I'm an Apple user so I'm typically very keen on the Apple keynote events, but usually not so much on CES, etc. But this one had me considering things a bit differently.

Apple is using a lot of these technologies like BLE and concepts like embedding the use of iOS into ""devices."" There's a big ecosystem of products that can be computer enabled that's getting just about prime for the taking. Who will execute well is yet to be determined. My bets are on open standards, which doesn't exclude Apple. But I can't imagine iOS on devices everywhere vs. Linux. Working with yes.

There's a lot of Java out there which I am not a fan of so I hope all this just erases that. I'd much rather have true Linux derivatives that anyone including Apple could access. Hell, my printers all AirPrint from my Ubuntu tower setups with practically zero config. That's a no go with Windows boxes, no matter how much one beats up a registry. 10 year old+ USB printers available wirelessly to all clients? No problem on Ubuntu or Mac.

What I do see here though is Microsoft continuing to be marginalized. Nothing here has Microsoft's fingerprint on it, aside from the dual boot laptop/tablet that Intel spoke of. And that was more of a finger print smear than anything. That was actually something I was amazed at from an architecture point of view. However, if I have Android, why the hell would I want Microsoft unless I really, really wanted to use Office or something dependent on an MS OS? The point is, I can do and output what I need without MS. Period. It's now...and it can also run MS. MS is an ""also ran"" now.

As an Apple user, if someone gave me an Android device for free, I'd play with it and keep it. If it was an Windows mobile device, I'd just pass it along without looking at it all most likely.

I'm impressed by Intel's creativity here for the first time. They're thinking outside of the box in a big way now. That's a long way from the days of the Pentium 4."

nickmista,askscience,1389095235.0,"First of all I should clarify that the foggy patch obviously is condensed water vapour. My guess would be that as you exhaled onto the cold window the water vapour in your breath cooled enough on impact with the glass to condense into water. The rate at which the fogginess disappears would be proportional to the humidity in the air. That is the higher the humidity the slower the fog would disappear, colder air will generally be less humid as well. Since when its cold it's usually easier for humidity to precipitate out of the air (don't quote me on that though). So the fog will evaporate into the air again, the less humid it is the greater the capacity for the air to 'absorb' the moisture. It would recede from the edges inward as the edges would have less moisture for the amount of cold air whereas the focal point of your breath would have more moisture, be more heated etc and hence take longer to evaporate."

I can't believe as an Apple user of old that rooted for IBM/Motorola PPC tech vs. Intel that I'm rooting for Intel now, but I am. I think they buried the P4 well enough, and have continued to become a respected force everywhere since then that they have put their resources to work successfully since and will continue to do so.

Than again, it was Scully, not Jobs, that went with PPC. Jobs wanted Intel. An accidental event that allowed Mac to avoid the Pentium III and 4 perhaps? That was a bad time for Intel from the inside out. Sales were good. But Intel was not looked upon well then in my CES program from students to the dean.

Mongoosen42,vegan,1389097517.0,"Hey, I work out too, and for a long time I was worried about getting enough protein as a vegan. But actually, our bodies don't need nearly as much protein as we think, and we don't need a crazy amount of protein when we work out. Most people can be healthy with a diet of about 5% protein. For body builders, Arnold Schwarzenegger himself only recommends a diet of about 10% protein. at 185 pounds, you will be just fine with 80-90 grams of protein a day, and according to many nutritionists, that estimate is still on the high side. If you google something along the lines of ""protein content of food by percentage"" you will probably be very surprised to find out that a lot of the things you eat already exceed the 10% protein mark, so extremely meticulous planning isn't really necessary.

Anyway, my advice for the best way to get a decent variety of flavors in your diet and also make sure that you always have enough protein is to make a lot of seitan and keep a well stocked spice capanet. I hate soy to be honest, but you can do amazing things with seitan."

It's hard to predict what would happen to their support if they were suddenly to call for an election but it is worth mentioning that we have a fixed election date (as designated by the coalition agreement) and so this is highly unlikely. 

The thinking is that it is best for both the national interest and the parties prospects if they serve the full term, providing stability and an environment for economic recovery. The LibDems had to prove that they were a party of government and that coalition government works . 

According to an online poll by Ashcroft (http://www1.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2014/01/04/lord-ashcrofts-mega-poll-has-ukip-on-16pc-the-highest-his-surveys-have-ever-recorded/) 35% of the general public would prefer a government with the libdems taking part (15% con-ld, 20% lab-ld) compared to 31%Con and 34%Lab.

&gt;the unlimited number of shuttlecraft and photon torpedoes

I'd just like to address this small nit pick because several others have addressed the more meaty topics surrounding motivation and character development, but it's something I feel is often overlooked.

One simple answer is: replicator technology. When you can feed in raw matter into the replicator and have whatever component you need spat out, it's fairly easy to see how they can keep the ship in such good condition. Especially considering matter (specifically deuterium/hydrogen) is abundant in the galaxy and the collection of it via the transporter is simple.

They built the Delta Flyer from scratch, what's to say they don't have a dedicated team of engineers replicating standard shuttle components and putting them together? They may be cut off from the Federation, but they still possess post-scarcity technology. It's basically the main point of their interactions with the Kazon."

You will never equate Long's talent to the same level as Ade or Soldado (they really aren't even close to being comparable), but you know every single time he gets on the pitch he will work. That actually is something we could use, pair it with the fact that he has a bit of pace and he would probably be a good compliment to our current strikers.

That said, if we were to sign him....i wouldn't be excited, i just wouldn't be upset (a bit how i feel about the Lescott rumor).

My question is: do you dislike this height because of the short jokes, the discrimination, the dating scene ecc. or because you'd just feel superior than other Asian men?

It might be that he's asexual. I have broached it with him before and he said that he wasn't- but again, I suspect that he felt unable to be truthful with me, or maybe felt emasculated by it in some way.

I went through a little phase of thinking I didn't have a sex drive- I look back on it now and think that it was a side effect of having to ignore how hurt and rejected I felt.

Then if you are breaking or what ever and one wheel has more grip than another it can provide more force. Normally to over simply things if one wheel loses traction while breaking you can either stop breaking as hard and regain 4 wheel traction, or remain breaking as hard but only use 3 wheels. Which is worse than 4 obviously. But if the wheels are independent if traction is lost it one wheel the other three can break like normal and 4th can ease up to regain traction. Now to progress on that thought it could work with acceleration and changes in direction. But also it would respond to the change in the amount of grip provided by the road in icy conditions.

mooli,climateskeptics,1389102287.0,"&gt; No you put the IPCC AR4 (which is old 2007) and tried to blame politics. The projections in the IPCC AR4 were way off. 

Why are you talking about projections? I linked to the section of the AR4 that addresses paleoclimate, and shows various climatic properties over the last 65 million years.

There is nothing that needs refuting in the data.

That you don't understand that, but instead use it to leap to the wrong conclusions as if you've uncovered some earth-shattering secret, is very much your problem, not mine.

&gt; It tends to move in cycles of warming and cooling. I'm just doubting the hype of Man Made Climate Change.

To put this in perspective, on the graph you linked, the whole of human history would take up approx 1/100 of a pixel. The last century of warming would be approx 1/10000 of a pixel.

The glacial/interglacial cycles you're talking about operate over timescales of tens of thousands of years. That is several orders of magnitude slower than the present rate of change.

This notion that you can look at 65 million years of incredibly gradual change and claim that it means that humans cannot also cause change on comparatively rapid timescales is utterly illogical. Just like saying ""because forest fires have started naturally throughout the entire history of the planet, nobody has ever started one with a lit cigarette""."

Still play him, with the 40% CDR he becomes a great bodyguard/initiator with a fantastic late game ult.  The highest base attack speed, and level 1 attack damage also give him a lot of power in the jungle.

If she were a client with whom you had no relationship prior to the shoot, I think it would be appropriate to tell them fairly matter-of-factly (but tactfully) that their scars are visible in the photos and offer them the choice of what to do next: leave them be, cover them up, or photoshop them out. It gives them the option to leave them in if they've chosen to embrace their scars as a representation of what they've conquered, but gives them a heads-up if they hadn't realised they were showing and want to keep them hidden. There's no reason to get any more involved than that, in my opinion. I certainly wouldn't advocate telling their parents/school.

I have a whole bunch of old scars, mostly confined to one of my forearms. I am always enormously (and silently!) grateful to the people who have to see them (I've recently been having fairly regular blood tests, for which I have to expose my arms), but simply do their job without commenting."

redundanteater,yankees,1389103917.0,"I think the timing may indicate that there are problems with the arbitration in that it might not go the way that MLB wants it to go. The evidentiary standard seems a little too low for such high stakes. I doubt very much that the case would hold up in a real court of law, and although the courts have been reluctant to meddle in arbitrations, baseball has a unique relationship with the law in the US due to its protection.

AnotherCrazyOne,technology,1389104231.0,"Care to share any articles that show Apple hardware costs ***8x*** more? Even a ""shitty"" sesationalist blogspam one? That would at least back up your argument a little. Something that doesn't use profanity to attempt to drive a point home also gives more merit to an argument. Force isn't that effective as some think it is. It's like shouting louder to get your point across. It's usually a sign that objectivity regarding valid points aren't able to be conjured by the one using force. If an argument isn't effective without profanity and/or force, what do you have to stand on? If you'd care to pick the article apart, then there might be some merit to your statement.

All I sense is bitter emotion in your reply. Not logic. Sadly, this is very typical of many, but not all non-Apple users in social debate. It's rare to find Apple users communicating as you have. Frankly what I expect is more profanity, a move towards name calling and down voting which has already happened. Have at it. I'm still right.

The idea that Apple hardware costs 8x more than anyone else is sensationalist at the least. Baffling and troll-like more likely."
Astaro,engineering,1389104256.0,"Most aircraft, have their center of mass ahead of their center of lift and center of lateral pressure. This is important because in this configuration, the wings of the aircraft act as weathervanes, turning it into the direction of airflow if it is disturbed.

aircraft with the center of lift behind the center of mass are unstable, because when disturbed from forward flight, the airflow want to push the wings aside, while the rear-located center of mass wants to keep moving in a straight line, flipping the aircraft.

So, an X-wing, with its rather large, rear located wings, and presumable forward center of mass would actually be very stable in flight. Of course, it would probably have insufficient control authority to maneuver, and unpowered flight would very quickly turn into a vertical decent...

I left my job because I couldn't cope with seeing her go through what I had given up. I think pregnancy is a beautiful thing, and you definitely do bond with that tiny cluster of cells.

Since the abortion, I have been baby crazy too. It's mainly jealousy, I want to put my life on fast forward so I can get to where I want to be. I kind of feel a little bit like, ""Why do they get to experience motherhood? Why can't I?"" but the abortion was my choice, and it was the best choice for my SO and I.

I sometimes wonder if having doubts about the abortion but going through with it anyway made me baby crazy.

If you ever need to talk to anyone who can relate, feel free to send me a PM :)"

It is responsible for someone who knows she cannot care adequately for the child.

It is responsible for someone who is on serious medication they must have to function and they realize that said medications would severely damage the fetus.

It is responsible for someone who already has children and can't risk her job by being pregnant and having another because the other children are relying on her.

Birth control can fail, yes, but are you seriously suggesting that people should live sexless lives to avoid pregnancy?

Also, it takes two to tango. Are you seriously suggesting that the men in question aren't responsible? Why, if contraception fails, are WOMEN tagged with the 'she was irresponsible, she knew the chances, she should've kept her legs closed' attitudes from others?"

superspeck,HomeImprovement,1389106006.0,"Go out to the street in front of your house and look for a box that is black plastic or green plastic, but could have a metal lid. It should be set at street level, and it will most likely be square but could be round. It will be on your property. 

When you open the box, after getting the spiders and creepie crawlies out of the way, you should find your water meter. It will look like an old watch face and will have a rocker dial (to indicate water flow), a big dial, and a little dial. Towards the street from the meter there will be a round valve, usually with a lever that doesn't actually look like a lever; it looks more like the tip of a flat-bladed screwdriver. This is the utility side shutoff. 

If there's another round box after the meter towards your house, and it has something that looks like a hose bib handle in it, use that instead -- that's your master shutoff. If you don't have that, which is not at all uncommon, then use the utility side shutoff. Just turn the valve 90 degrees. 

I know that you're cash tight right now from just getting into a house, but as a homeowner you really really really need to have an emergency fund. Once you let a house start to deteriorate and have one system not working (like your heat pump compressor), you'll find that the rest of the house breaks pretty fast -- your pipes freeze and leak, and then the framing deteriorates, and pretty soon you're left with junk. Keeping enough cash to maintain a house is just as big of a duty as paying your mortgage or taxes. "

2) If they are independent shades, what is the retention mechanism?  Is it a metal tension clip, or base screws?  go to amazon, look up ceiling fan glass shade, buy a few different ones that you think may work, and hope you get lucky.  You can return the ones you dont want.

3) If it is one big glass piece, I would say you are better off replacing the fan completely.  A new hunter fan is $50-$100, and the wiring and mounting will be easy because you should have everything all set to go."

jrock954,yugioh,1389106571.0,"I think that your opinion of this card has a lot to do with what deck you run. Personally, I enjoy facing a deck that I know can make this card. It makes me play more conservatively, and as a result I seem to win more. I'm testing two decks currently, Hieratic and Gogogo; the former uses big combos and lends itself to over-extension, and the latter toolboxes Rank 4s all day. With my Hieratics I found myself trying to play them like my Ruler deck last year - big play all day. No deck currently can come back from a botched big play like Rulers can, so I kept getting my ass handed to me because I wasn't being smart with my resources. After putting the Hieratics down and working with my Gogogos online I started finding situations where I could use **Exciton Knight** to stop an opponent who was bringing overbearing power down on me and would have had me on the back foot, top-decking until he finally put me down. **Exciton Knight** has never won me a game, but he has saved me from getting my face ground in more than once. Picking my Hieratics up again last night, I had time to play three games, one against a Zombie; one against Constellar; and the last against an Evilswarm deck, and after the first time my over-zealousness was punished by **Exciton** I started playing slower and more conservatively, and I did better because of it.    
    
To me this card does what so many of us wanted a card to do; it slows the meta down. How many times have we watched a deck gain momentum and snowball into a push that takes the game? I feel like if this card had been released last format everyone would be praying at the altar of **Exciton** as opposed to stringing him up by his funny helmet. All the little Rank 4 toolbox decks now actually stand a chance against the top meta decks. What good is being able to pull one Rank 4 a turn if your opponent has a full field and three or four set? If that one card is **Exciton**, then you may still have a chance. If you hate this card, Konami didn't make it for you. They made it specifically to stop you, and the fact that it's making you rethink your balls-in plays and slow your roll a bit shows that it's doing exactly what so many of us thought the banning of Heavy Storm would do."

My aunt, who I consider a second mother, is obese. She had been fat as long as I've been alive, but when I was a kid she was just overweight. She was also a heavy smoker back then, and when she quit smoking (she quit because I has asthma and am allergic to tobacco smoke) she started gaining more and more weight. She's admitted she replaced her tobacco addiction with a food addiction. That was about 15 years ago, and she's up to at least 350 now. 

She's always going out to eat, and usually gets a burger and fries. She doesn't drink water, only soda or juice. She refers fatty cuts of meat and has a sweet tooth. She's also pretty much sedentary. She's a teacher but sits at her desk most of the day. She can't exercise or walk very well because her knees are bad, and her knees are bad because she's so heavy. It's a sad and vicious cycle.

She knows why she's fat but won't take the steps needed to change because it's too difficult. She's one of my favorite people in the world and is really an amazing woman, but I'm terrified she'll be gone before I get married, much less be around to meet my children. "

Meanwhile, I see the people I live with take their four-year-old to the toy shop nearly every day, he has an iPad and they were discussing buying him a Wii U. They are *technically* educated (business related degrees) but work in retail and can't afford what they give the kid. Most of his toys apart from a few big electronic things are really cheap plastic stuff, he has no Lego bricks (or Duplo ones?), barely any books (half of which are mine) and also no sense for the worth of things. He barely eats any food unless he can watch Transformers videos on his iPad while eating. I think it's all kind of horrible.

I also know affluent people who have an iPad and allow their kids to use it. For half an hour a week. I think that's okay.

So in conclusion, just based on what I've seen, it seems to be more normal for affluent people to not shower their kids with toys and random stuff. It is more of a problem with people who didn't have everything as kids themselves which is something the article actually mentions."

I discussed this a bit in another thread about recording, but many engineers will have certain things they are better at than others (James Cannon with hip-hop/R&amp;B, Tat Tong with electronic/pop, etc.). Off the top of my head, though, these are the guys that I have looked to as mentors (I am a budding producer/audio engineer myself) and guys that I consider to be among the best a cappella mixers around right now:

* Bill Hare
* Dave Sperandio (does less mixing and focuses more on mastering these days)
* James Cannon
* Tat Tong (does less a cappella these days and mostly focuses on his mainstream pop career)
* Ed Boyer (did the Warblers stuff on Glee and I believe live mixing for Sing Off, among other things you may have heard)
* Dave Longo, Angela Ugolini, Nick Lyons, Mark Hines (The Vocal Company)
* James Gammon (not to be confused with Cannon)
* Danny Ozment
* Alex Green and Alex Koutzoukis (Plaid Productions)

That all said, if you are looking for an engineer(s) (again, I covered the advantages of using multiple engineers in the recording thread), I would HIGHLY recommend doing some research on the ones you are interested in, check out their portfolio (usually readily available online or just ask), and decide who fits the style you are going for. It's a very tight-knit community, so generally any of them will be willing to help you out, answer questions, or make recommendations if another engineer may be able to better help your project in a certain area.

Like I said, I am a budding audio engineer myself, and I have learned from most of the guys I listed above, so please feel free to PM me with any specific questions you may have!"

I don't see why you exclude historical days like July 4th or Thanksgiving. They're a tradition rooted within a culture, one that we practice collectively and draw strength from, and has little to no religious connotation. In short, they're exactly the thing you're challenging us to find. If you want another one that's incredibly rooted in a culture without a religious background, look up Guy Fawkes Day in England. 

I you want mythology that doesn't draw from faith: Johnny Appleseed and Paul Bunyan are figured made to represent cornerstones of America. culture. Heck, some Christmas traditions are not based in religion at all (Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, Frosty the snowman). We te those stories because they resonate with us as a group, but not out of religious faith.

The point I'm making is that mythology is based not in religion, but in culture. A fine distinction, because most cultures cake together because of shared religious fath, but a present one nonetheless. Small things that we do for no reason but because that's how we do them (put your tooth under a pillow, so the tooth fairy can retrieve it).

No, because I didn't make and will not defend that assertion.

I mean, I could throw together a WordPress site if it were necessary, but why?

&gt;Something that doesn't use profanity to attempt to drive a point home also gives more merit to an argument.'

Limiting one's vocabulary artificially seems a little absurd, no?

&gt; It's usually a sign that objectivity regarding valid points aren't able to be conjured by the one using force.

That was a nice attempt at sounding good, but it didn't actually end up being grammatically correct or making any sense.

&gt;If an argument isn't effective without profanity and/or force, what do you have to stand on?

Who says it wasn't effective without? 

&gt;All I sense is bitter emotion in your reply.

Yes, I'm bitter somehow because you posted blogspam and I pointed that out.

&gt;Sadly, this is very typical of many, but not all non-Apple users in social debate. It's rare to find Apple users communicating as you have.

OK, you have to be a troll. Please tell me you're a troll.

Often when I talk to feminists who subscribe heavily to patriarchy theory, men's issues are often written off as ""well, when we dismantle the patriarchy men's issues will be solved."" which is garbage or ""women are more oppressed so we need to deal with those issues first."" which might have been the case in the western world 50 years ago, but isn't the case today imo.

Water, silt, and dirt often collects in the boxes. You will probably have to dig down in the black plastic box to find your shutoff. Dig down with a garden trowel or something until you find a pipe, wire, valve, or the end of the plastic box. 

On the inside, you need to find those pipes that are frozen. You will need to cut drywall to do this. There's not really much of an alternative because you need to be sure it's not leaking; leaking will lead to mold and mildew. If you do it right, you should be able to just put the drywall back when you're done. Try and cut across enough space near the bottom of the wall that you know you'll have more than two studs to screw the drywall back into. 

If you can't find your house-side shutoff, you need to use the city side. You might need a hook of some sort or just a screwdriver to open the metal cover. There's usually a hole in it, and it's just held in place by it's own weight. You can also call your utility department and request that they come shut the water off, and watch how they do it."

LeeTaeRyeo,singing,1389108471.0,"How are you EQ-ing the piano? It might be that you need to make a bit of a cut around 200-500 in order to make room for the vocals (if you can, automate this so it only happens when the vocals are actually happening or else it will make the piano sound not-so-nice). Sometimes other instruments can crowd a given frequency spectrum and you have to reduce on instrument's presence to make another instrument ""fit"". It just so happens that the piano in this case lies within the same range as the vocals, so you might have to do some reduction there.

Also, it might be useful to run all of the tracks to another bus and add reverb to that bus. What this does is it makes it seem that all of the instruments are being played in the same space. When you only apply reverb to individual instruments, one runs the risk of it sounding like each instrument is being played in a different room.

If you decide to go with compression, be gentle with it. Compression can help, but be warned that it can reduce dynamic ranges. Maybe try a gentle ratio (something like 1.5:1 or 2:1).

One final suggestion/recommendation is to consult [this website](http://tweakheadz.com/). This website has tons of resources on mixing at home and even a few pointers on mastering. One of my former profs even used this site in one of his classes in lieu of a textbook."

If it's not moving, there's no leaks. If it's moving ... find the leak. 

I'm not sure how I'd get the pipes thawed without breaking drywall, though. If you have PEX you need to heat the wall cavity or the plastic directly. If you have copper you can heat the copper in one spot and it will transmit the heat along the length of the line.

dinosauru,todayilearned,1389109036.0,"Well, think about it. It was approx 0.7 semitones off (started off around -0.6, progressed to -0.7 after a week), so it's not even like things were still on a major (or even minor) scale at that point. I know it doesn't sound like very much, but it sounded AWFUL. Like a tape deck running out of juice, or a shitty cover band that can't stay on-note. And that's what everything sounded like through my ears while I was on it. There are certain sounds you just expect to always sound the same -- tones when dialing a phone number, alert noises on the computer, favorite music -- and all of it was slightly off enough to be extremely disconcerting/grating.

All I can say is: Go get yourself a pitch-changing program and adjust some music you like to be 0.7 semitones lower than normal.

MazDatsun,cars,1389109056.0,"I don't mind this being the blind-justice in telling exactly who was going how fast and doing what in the moments leading up to an accident. While some cars have the ability to recall max speed ever recorded, highest g-force etc. THIS device is not designed to do that. Manufactures have other logging that IIRC is built into the PCM which can store/recall things aforementioned like Max Speed, rev limiter counter, Max RPM etc. and can be used to refuse warranty on something like a blown engine if it shows you have hit the rev limiter for a total of ""X"" Seconds. 

Unless it's discovered/released that these can actually be used to prosecute people for their driving habits (speeding) OUTSIDE of an accident/collision then I'm not terribly concerned. 

From my understanding, these ""black boxes"" are situational data logging i.e. in the event of a crash, it stores the data at the time of the crash. They only have the ability to record parameters for a few moments leading up to and during the accident.

A good quote from an [NPR article](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/03/20/174827589/yes-your-new-car-has-a-black-box-wheres-the-off-switch)
&gt; This is crash data — moment-by-moment statistics saved from the car's most recent collision. There's speed, acceleration, braking — even information from inside the car.

Smokeahontas,relationships,1389109069.0,"I think that, like many people, your expectations of how a relationship works has been warped by society, by the media, whatever. 

The thing is, most of the time a good, steady relationship IS going to be dinners at the couch/kitchen table and some Netflix. A relationship isn't always going to be this grand sweeping romance with trials and tribulations and teary-eyed proclamations of everlasting love. I'm sure that you know this, but you seem to really have internalized some of these messages about what a relationship should be like. 

The other thing that concerns me is you are making all these gestures with the expectation that he will, in turn, make some gestures for you. That's not the way it works. When you love someone, you don't do things for them so that they'll do things for you. You do them because it makes you happy to make the person you love happy. I fucking despise moving dishes from the sink to the dishwasher, but I know a sink full of dishes drives my SO nuts, so I do it because I don't want him to stress over these dishes when he gets home from work. 

I don't think you're selfish or a bad person, I just think you haven't yet found that relationship where reciprocity isn't something to be expected, it's just done out of love. "

We also need to know what your intended energy efficiency is -- whether you plan to very tightly seal the house and eliminate thermal bridging, or whether you are going to use standard code-minimum construction. 

A couple of neat ideas -- if you're in a cold climate, you could build the house around a wood stove or a wood pellet stove. These are usually pretty well sealed units, especially in the case of the pellet stove, and are highly efficient. By placing it in the center of the house, you can heat all of the rooms around it 

There's ""net zero"" houses being built in Massachusetts (featured a few months ago in Fine Homebuilding) with solar panels on the roof, a ridiculously low number of air changes per hour, and one or two mini split HVAC units ... the sort that you'd find in a small apartment or a hotel room, but heating and cooling an entire 1600 sq ft two story house! You definitely need to have someone with experience engineer this solution because it drastically changes your construction methods and quality and requires engineering an air exchanger into the system so that you don't suffocate. But they found that they were able to heat and cool reliably with a pair of mini splits in the living area and the upstairs hallway, but they needed to make some adjustments to allow air to move smoothly between rooms with the doors closed.

To be born into a legally subordinate position (i.e. commoner), because there exists a legally entitled class, the head of which is head of state (and even head of the church) eviscerates the very thought of equality amongst human beings.

StuHardy,WritingPrompts,1389109847.0,"This is how I would do it:

* The film opens with Spidey stopping a robber, just by showing up. His notoriety and appreciation by New Yorkers makes the criminals give up before he can do anything.
* He then swings back to his crappy apartment, where MJ is waiting (a correlation with how the 2nd film ended.) They're engaged and doing OK, but nothing extraordinary.
* On the TV, they see a feature of John Jameson (MJ's finacée from SM2) returning to Earth from space, and that he'll be leading a talk at the same college Peter is at.
* Meanwhile, Harry Osborn is contemplating using the chemicals his father used to become the Green Goblin. **NOW**, the butler confesses that Norman went insane and was killed by his own glider. Harry is upset, but remembers how erratically his father acted before he died and realises that the butler is correct. He then works on correcting the chemicals, to improve himself without costing his sanity.
* Peter &amp; MJ attend the talk by John (Peter as a photographer for The Daily Bugle, MJ to apologise.) The talk is about an alien symbiote, capable of healing the human body and potentially curing fatal diseases.
* Eventually, J. Jonah Jameson realises that Peter &amp; MJ are dating. While he cannot fire Peter on such frivolous grounds (being reminded of such by Joseph ""Robbie"" Robertson,) he is clearly furious.
* MJ &amp; John find a quiet room, where MJ apologises for leaving him at the alter. John is upset, saying that he hopes she is happy with Peter. Meanwhile, a portion of the alien symbiote responds to John's calls; detaches itself from the main body and grabs onto MJ's shoe. When she meets up with Peter, the symbiote attaches itself to him.
* That night, Peter has a nightmare of his red suit and a new black suit fighting over him. The black suit is victorious. Peter wakes up - realising he is on top of the Empire State building, decked out in the black suit.
* Although initially worried, Peter becomes accustomed to the black suit (allowing it to change clothes at will.) However, he becomes more emotional and arrogant.
* When Jameson attempts to fire Peter for showing a photo of Spiderman in his black suit (calling it fake,) Peter stands up to Jameson, calling him out that no-one else comes as close to him as his pictures of Spidey. He then threatens to leave, go to the Daily Globe and give exclusivity rights to them, effectively making The Daily Bugle uncompetitive. He then storms out of Jameson's office.
* Harry finally arranges to meet with Peter and talk things through. However, Peter's emotions get the better of him, calling Norman a psychopath and insisting that he was the son Harry never was. Harry, heartbroken by this, orders him to leave. He then resumes work on the chemicals.
* MJ tries to talk reason into Peter, but he's becoming more erratic (montage of him attacking criminals, more violence, less courteous, etc) He then gives an outburst on that if he'd go public, he could get sponsorship or funding that would make him more financially sound, instead of living in the dump he does. He then proceeds to smash his possessions. When the landlord knocks, he becomes overtly aggresive, physically threatening and only stopping when MJ begs him to stop. Scared at what he has become, Peter flees.
* Peter rests in the church bell-tower. Unknowingly, John is in the church, having been drinking and now returning to the place where he should have been married.
* Peter works out the black suit is consuming him, and that the bell tolls weaken it. As the bells ring midnight, he manages to pull himself free of the symbiote.
* At the same time, a drunken John challenges God, saying that if he were real, he would give him the power to win back MJ. As he goes to leave, he steps in the symbiote, thinking it a puddle. He looks up, but sees no water mark. As he leaves, the symbiote binds to his shoe.
* Peter returns home, apologises to the landlord and MJ and searches through the destruction to find his classic red &amp; blue suit. He tells MJ he didn't mean what he said, only for MJ to confess that she sometimes thinks those things to; that it's better to let it out than to bottle up emotions and lash out.
* Upon returning to his space facility, the symbiote on John's shoes detaches and binds with the majority of the symbiote. John notices a change in the symbiote. He goes over to investigate. For a split-second, the symbiote forms the face of Venom, before launching itself onto John and slowly binding with him. Embittered at being rejected by Peter and twisted from being left at the alter by MJ, John becomes Venom and goes out to kill Peter Parker.
* Peter goes out as Spiderman, aiming to repair his reputation. Someone calls him for help at the college. When he arrives, he realises it's a trap set by Venom. The two battle, but Venom (with his equal knowledge of skill and abilities of Spidey, coupled with John's superior physical and mental state) takes the upper hand.
* As the fight is reported on live, MJ hears Venom call out Peter for the same reasons as John. Realising they are one and the same, she leaves the apartment.
* MJ goes to Harry (knowing from Peter that the Osbornes have superior weapons technology,) asking him to help. Harry refuses because of how Peter acted, but MJ says that Peter is Spiderman, and he's dying; if Harry can live with that, so be it. Once she leaves, Harry goes to his lab - the formula is 95% ready, but knowing he won't have the time for it to be perfect, prepares the machines.
* Spidey is getting his ass handed to him, as Venom throws him into a building site. He then begins to violently beat Spidey with anything he can find. Just when it appear that Venom is going to land the killer blow, his ""Venom sense"" kicks in, as he turns and grabs...a pumpkin bomb. It explodes and launches him backwards. Harry has arrived, dressed in an updated version of the Green Goblin armour and glider. He distracts Venom, while Spidey begins to recover.
* As Venom has no idea how to face or beat Harry, the fight proves more interesting. Venom's brutality is met with Harry's technological improvements and the two are matched. Harry then gets Venom into a position in which Spidey can instigate a sonic trap (what he did in the 3rd film) and separate John from Venom. As Peter uses his web to pull John out, Harry uses a pumpkin bomb to destroy the symbiote.
* John, exhausted, confesses his intentions so that he could be with MJ. Spidey ties him up and lowers him to ground level. However, Harry begins to realise that his mind is starting to change and be driven to kill Peter. He coerces Peter into keeping his focus on Harry, as Harry's glider hovers behind Peter. He finishes by telling Peter ""Godspeed."" Peter's Spider-sense kicks in, and in a copy of the first film's finale, he backflips over the glider, which collides with Harry, knocking him over the edge and down 5 stories to the ground.
* Peter leaps down to help Harry, who confesses that he knew his sanity was fading, but couldn't bring himself to kill Peter. Knowing that he has to die, he committed suicide to ensure that Peter wouldn't have to kill him. With his dying breath, Harry forgives Peter. Peter, as Spiderman, carries the body of his best friend through the crowd to the ambulance.
* The film skips to a week later, after Harry's funeral. MJ tells Peter that it's not his fault, while Peter says that everyone he loves dies, and that he would understand if MJ wanted to call the wedding off. MJ responds that Harry chose to save his friend and she chose to love and marry him.
* The film then cuts to a year later, where Peter and MJ have just been married. As they drive off in the limo, Peter begins to sense something. MJ, rolling her eyes, attaches an ear-piece and gives one to Peter. She then reveals a police-radio scanner and says ""Go get 'em, Tiger."" Peter opens the sunroof, grabs MJ and jumps up. As MJ is catapulted high, Peter changes into his costume and grabs her before she falls. They swing off together into the New York sunset.

* POST-CREDIT SCENE: At the Daily Globe, the Daily Bugle's main rival, the Editor is shouting at the photographer, demanding that he gets a decent picture of Spiderman - comparing Peter Parker as far superior -  or he's fired. The photographer goes back to his desk in a huff. Unbeknownst to him, a slither of symbiote remains. It slithers across the desk and reveals the name: ""Eddie Brock Jr.""

Renner1,AskReddit,1389109864.0,"&gt; conservatives tend to be less supportive of feminism and gay rights then others

Sure, there are some conservatives or extremely conservative pundits who love getting into a war of words and insults with the most twitchy, partisan third wave feminists and militant LGBTers.

But I consider myself as an egalitarian, when it comes to the sexes-- I think that functional adult men and women are entitled to the same rights and have to observe the same sense of responsibility.

I utterly reject feminist terminology and theory, especially gender theory and third wave theory. I find it to be absolutely baseless, especially in the historical sense, and the contemporary third wave theory is rubbish also.

I'm pretty vague on the subject of gay marriage, in general-- I think that if they want people to be more open or more accepting of the idea, they need to lose the militant queer shit, as well as the grotesque flamboyancy characteristic of much of popular gay culture.

&gt; I'm just speaking from my experience. I don't know many young people who don't identify as feminists.

That's interesting. Hardly anyone I know really gets into third wave feminism-- some of the most obnoxious, most hypocritical, most outright stupid girls I know are very, very loud about third wave feminism and spouting all the rubbish theory that comes with it, but for the most part people I've met are quietly egalitarian to varying degrees.

&gt; the ones who aren't tend to be MRAs

I have to say that I ""love"" how MRA has become some sort of vile insult or accusation. 

I can't at all say that I agree with a lot of the more intense MRAs, but in general they make points that are worth taking into consideration then shrieks of ""patriarchy"" and ""misogyny"" ad infintium.


&gt; though I have an issue with some people who seem to think gay marriage is the biggest human rights issue

It's funny because they get so upset over it and they're shooting themselves in the foot by getting all militantly queer and perpetuating the stereotype of the gay as a mincing, lisping, oversexed caricature.

&gt; In my opinion, a bigger issue is the fact that homosexuality is punishable by prison or death in many countries.

You'll probably hate to hear this, but the LGBT issues aren't really of that much, if any concern to me.

And why shouldn't I say it? Militant LGBTs or gay rights campaigners don't seem to give two shits about anyone else in countries where you can't be as absurdly surreal about your sexual preferences as you like.

I find the Sochi thing especially gets on my nerves. The usual suspects shitting themselves over gays not being allowed to prance around naked in parades, but no one gives a shit about the Caucasus situation and know fuck-all about the people living in Chechnya or Dagestan-- for example.

That's one thing you have to learn...if you don't want the possibility of hearing an honest answer to a difficult question, don't ask the question.  

I'm going to be honest here, because I think this is important, and I want you to take this in the spirit it's offered, so imagine I'm sitting with you holding your hands while I say this. I think you have a problem, but not the kind that you think. For your height, 110 pounds is a very good weight - not too much, not too little. You aren't chubby, you aren't fat, and you don't have a weight problem anymore. You have done very well losing those 25 lbs! That's not an easy task. 90 lbs at your height, however, is *underweight*. It's too thin. I know what it's like to be underweight - I lived that for years, and trust me, it's not going to make you feel as happy with yourself as you think it will. I wasn't very strong, I tired too quickly, and it's not good for your health to weigh too little. You don't need to get yourself down to 90 lbs, and you sure as heck shouldn't aim lower. This is what I mean when I say you have a problem: you want to be unhealthily thin. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that it's in response to the way you were treated/made to feel about yourself before you lost those 25 pounds. That's totally understandable...society is absolutely horrible to women who aren't ""thin enough"", and the standards by which a woman's weight is judged are wholly unrealistic and harmful. But swinging the other way and making yourself too thin isn't going to help, and it won't be good for your body either. 

And what makes me worried for you is that you seem to tie your worth as a person to your weight. You call yourself ""110lb worthless girl"", and you hate yourself to the point of contemplating suicide because you don't feel that you're thin enough. Hun, *why*? There is *so much more* to you than the number on the scale. You have so much more to offer than what size your clothes are. And those other things - your mind, your talents, your love - are so much more important than your body. Those things about you are entirely unaffected by your weight... weighing more won't make them disappear and weighing less won't make them stronger. I think you should talk to someone about weight and body image and the way you look at these things, at yourself. It's not good to want to be underweight, and it's really dangerous to base all your feelings about yourself on your weight. I'm concerned for your wellbeing...please, talk to someone. A parent, a friend (someone other than whoever told you that you're chubby!! it sounds like she's either jealous of you, or has a skewed idea of what a healthy body should look like), a school counselor, your doctor. But please seek some help. You don't have to feel this way, you don't have to go through it all alone. This isn't worth dying for. 

If you want to eat healthy, go for it. If you want to work out, keep it up! But you should learn to do those things because you care about your body and want it to be healthy, not because you hate yourself. 

I hope you can find some peace, friend.  (((((hugs)))))

i was under the impression that it is severe obesity that causes issues whereas you arent even borderline obese you were 20+ pounds from obesity before pregnancy and as long as you havent gained more than 35 pounds already, you should still be considered overweight but not close to obese. It sounds like doc is looking at your pregnancy weight compared to anyone elses nonpregnant weight to determine if you are obese, which is not the way to do it.

It would be like weighing someone and then weighing someone else the same size but carrying a 30lb weight and saying #2 is obese because the scale said so.

Of course if you have gained more than a healthy pregnancy weight that can change this."

ballookey,exjw,1389110301.0,"I bought an Ouija board just before the holidays. Honestly they've never held much fascination for me - even when I was a JW and believed in demons and spirits, I didn't think they operated through a toy. It seemed to me, the way the board was designed was *highly* conducive to people influencing the movement of the planchette and so you could never know that your answers were coming from the spirit world.

I mean, why do people even need to touch it while it moves at all? If it's being moved by spirits, then there's no reason to touch it. Maybe the person asking the question could hold the planchette while asking the question, then place it on the board. But that doesn't make a good party game because quite obviously *nothing would happen* without people inducing the movement. It's a magic 8 ball in a different package.

But I figured some people are so scared of them, so convinced that they do act as a conduit to the spirit world, that I wanted to see for myself.

We got it out during a party over the holidays, had five adults sitting around it, and exactly *nothing* happened.

To be fair, these were five adults who are all atheists/agnostic and don't believe in spirits. None of us was trying to move the planchette, even in jest. We just sat there. After a while one or the other would wiggle it - we purposefully swirled it around a bit: ""wake it up! Maybe we need to warm it up!"" with some laughs. But no messages. We gave it up in favor of something else.

Some other time, when it's not a holiday party, I might do some further testing. If I can, I'll find someone to join in who believes in spirits. Try some of the techniques for blindfolding the participants and rotating the board, putting a stack of coins on the planchette in order to determine if movement is originating from the planchette or a person touching it, etc..."

And it can vary depending on how you meet but the percentage of women that are modern day slaves in the sex trade is huge! I've seen documentaries on sex slave trafficking and it rips your heart out.

And even if you ask her, there's little chance she would tell the truth. If she's caught she could be beaten (in a way where bruises don't show), denied food or, since chances are she's addicted to drugs (a means of control), she could be denied whatever her addiction is.

Lastly, since she won't be a willing participant given the high probability she is a slave, it would be rape. Maybe without the physical appearance of rape but since she doesn't want to have sex, it *is* rape! And you will never know the truth about her situation which means you'll never know if you raped a woman or not. Do you want to run that risk? Put yourself in her shoes, being raped 10-20 times a day (and I mean sodomized in the case of a guy).

Even if she isn't a slave, she probably works with some and the money you pay to her boss will only go to purchase another woman who is someone's daughter/sister/mom off the black market who will then suffer a life of extreme depression, anxiety, and in many cases suicide.

I'll second what Snackerbob said: identify your needs. If you decide that the JW faith is nonsense but that you still believe in a god and Jesus, then there are plenty of friendly non-denominational Christian groups that you can meet with.

If you don't believe, well, now you're free to study anything at all that you might find interesting. Maybe at first you'll feel rudderless, but there's a whole world of interesting activities, people, classes, pursuits out there. Books, movies, music, etc…

And of course there's no rule at all that you *have* to do anything. That may be the hardest part about leaving the JW's: You're now in charge of your own agenda, instead of having it filled in for you. But you don't have to rush, you don't have to do anything you don't feel comfortable with. 

When I stopped filling my life with JW literature, I started spending hours at the bookstore and library, just browsing, picking out things that sounded interesting.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,BodyAcceptance,1389111312.0,"&gt;But if I'm a perfect weight then why isn't my stomach flat all the time?

It doesn't have to be. A flat stomach isn't always a sign of being a healthy weight, and a stomach that isn't totally flat isn't a sign that you weigh too much. Our bodies as women have a bit more curve to them than male bodies, and that includes our stomachs. Furthermore, the flatness of your stomach is influenced by a lot of things - how much you've eaten today (and what time of day it is), whether you are PMSing/retaining water, what sort of condition your abdominal muscles are in, whether you've recently lost a bit of weight, whether you've had a child or not, etc. It's normal to wake up with a flat stomach because you haven't eaten in hours and hours, and as the day goes by and you eat your meals, your stomach will look a bit less flat as you digest your food. 

I'm right on the line between normal weight and slightly underweight (I have a hard time keeping weight on and i was very sick a few weeks ago), and even my stomach isn't flat all the time. That's normal. And it's okay. 

Do you know what I learned a few years back? It really surprised me...I wasn't expecting it at all. I've had three babies, and that makes your body change somewhat. I gained some weight and lost it, and gained and lost, and gained and lost, and then stayed around 155 for a few years. I didn't like the way my stomach looked; the upper part was still taut, but my lower abs pooched out, and the skin was crisscrossed with faded stretch marks. I hit the gym and worked out, whipped my abs into shape, and still my stomach was not flat like I wanted it to be. But then, on a whim, I went to a belly dancing class with my mom. At first, seeing my stomach reflected back at me in the studio mirrors was depressing. But that began to change as I slowly began to learn how to dance. As my stomach began to learn how to be part of the dance, I stopped seeing it as just a collection of flaws. I realized that, stretch marks or not, it could still be sexy and alluring. I realized that this part of me was actually kind of cool...it had accommodated three little people and healed itself, and now it was learning to do things it had never done before, like undulating and shhimmying. I went out and got my navel pierced, because I felt like instead of hating my belly I should be decorating it for all it had done for me. It really changed everything. I have since lost about 25 pounds, like you. And my stomach still isn't perfectly flat. But it doesn't matter, because it can dance even more now, and that's more fun!

Maybe that would help you, too...to think about all the stuff your body can *do* and not just how it looks. And if there aren't many things it can do, that can be fixed...there are all kinds of cool skills you can learn without even needing to pay for lessons or classes! YouTube is overloaded with tutorials for all different kinds of dance styles and exercises and activities. If you want to learn something all you have to do is type it in and chances are good you'll find it. You should try that! At the very least, you'll have some fun.   : )   I recommend looking up Melbourne Shuffle tutorials...it's a blast!"

The porn I watch is mostly stuff I would not even imagine myself ever doing, and it quite often fails to arouse me.

Why then do I watch this stuff?

I marvel at how men and women can do some of this stuff while a buncha others surround them with bright lights, still cameras clicking in the background and all that stuff.

I look at the absolutely terrible acting and worse screenplays if ya wanna even call them that and tell myself I could make far better stuff with the gear they have and some willing actors.

I wonder where they are now, when they find out that this stuff isnt gonna make them rich or famous, and may even kill them.

But for me to even have to explain the attraction of a given work on film to my SO would be a burden, and take maybe telepathy to explain.

One thing it definitely is not, is wishful thinking, or a desperate turning to something my SO lacks or is unable to do for me..

I don't wanna be a porn star, or be in the scene, or even do what is shown to be physically possible although absurd. 

American porn is the worst in terms of sensuality and often turns on pretty nasty attitudes about young supposedly naive women, plus nearly always these days ends up with some salami size something shoved up the anus.

Japanese porn is more quirky and interesting as a cultural window into their sense of moral boundaries.

Euro porn has more body hair and 'normal' looking people.

Britporn is just plain bad most of the time with depressingly ugly but normal looking people.

And Russian porn is usually a bad semi pro copy of bad American porn.

The reason you don't get taught how to 'do your taxes' in school is that it's basically useless to try and teach you a specific tax years form.  Most of the tax code isn't relevant until you have income of note, by which time the rules will have changed from when you were in highschool, and people who don't stay in the same location (province/state or country) end up having to read the local tax rules anyway.

They've compared themselves against their peers, pop stars, and actresses, and they don't think they're as pretty. They're scared that the guy's going to realize they aren't as pretty, either. And they don't know what the guy could possibly like about him.

After a few relationships under her belt, hopefully she'd adopt a more reasonable stance. OP's girlfriend is apparently a senior in college. That makes her behavior a lot worse, and she should have already dealt with these kinds of immaturity issues."

wacky,TrueReddit,1389111695.0,"As a PhD level researcher, I can't imagine how that would be the case. In my lab and others around, people have their own projects; if you took 3 months off, your project could just be put on hold for 3 months. Sure, nothing would be getting done on that project, but research projects are pretty much only time-sensitive to the grad student who wants to graduate early, and all projects have a lot of time built in. Even if no one goes anywhere, you never know how long cutting-edge research is going to take: sometimes projects tank despite having a skilled and hard-working student, and sometimes they get done in half the time, that's just the nature of research.

Of course, that doesn't stop professors from getting annoyed about stuff, but I think that's the culture and not the research. In the U.S., we get grad students expecting them to work 50 weeks a year for ~6 years; that's the expectation, and if you don't live up to it, you're looked down upon, no matter how good or bad your work. I imagine that, same as industry, if we had a ""culture"" where it was expected that sometimes, grad students or employees take significant time off, it would be no problem."

People who are terribly out of shape are able to come, exercise, and feel like they're working toward something, and they are. I've been to several other schools who feel like Cobra Kai from the Karate Kid, with a cold, very militant vibe, which drives away the modest, and the impaired.

But personally speaking, I had an excellent time getting my ATA black belt. I can say that I had nothing but completely positive experiences. My instructors were courteous, and very technically minded. It was the kind of dojang that you could get out of it exactly what you put into it, and if you were serious about it, the instructors were more than happy to help bring you up to the 'next level'. That's why I think I'm going to seek an ATA school when I resume my training. "

Renner1,OneY,1389112709.0,"&gt; I don't need to use fallacies such as ad hominem to discuss this with you

What you linked was pretty unrelated to anything we were talking about-- some blathering about socially retarded nerds/basement dwellers and ""male privilege"" because fan service for nerds or something like that.

I assumed you were trying to say that I was similar to a socially retarded basement-dwelling nerd, mostly due to the fact that what you linked hasn't any context to what we're talking about here. 

I got it wrong in the sense that ad hominem would have to be based off of something that I was proven to have done or said-- I suppose the assumed implication could count as ad hominem.


&gt; basing your argument only on your own experiences as though they were representative of the whole of women's experiences.

Not really. I was just pointing out the fact that I as a man and all the men who I'm friends or acquainted with have never considered there to be a ""friend zone"" and have never acted as though something of that nature existed. You really only hear the loudest/most obnoxious of the third wave feminists talking about it, and considering some of the other things they say, it's not something to be taken at face value, to say the least.

Otherwise, the term only seems to really crop up on the internet, most often in terms of people talking about whether or not it actually exists as a thing, or how terrible this vague, loosely defined, unproven situation/theory is.

The main thing I intended to do was refute this third wave feminist nonsense of the ""selfish childish chauvinistic men and their nasty anti-woman friendzone"" much in the same way I would refute third wave feminists bleating about the hordes of ""nice guys/'pseudo-rapists' "".

They seem to love taking absolutely anything to work into their ridiculous narrative. Guy was upset that his relationship with a girl didn't develop into something more? He's obviously the worst sort of sexist and his disappointment proves that he sees women as walking vaginas. He's also two steps away from becoming a rapist.

Shit attitudes like that I find absolutely intolerable.

The second wave starting in the 1960s which embraced patriarchy social theory and third wave that came about in the 1990s that in the eyes of some second wave feminists watered down the goals of the second wave. 

This watering down is where I think comments like ""Think women are people? You're a feminist!"" come from. While I disagree with patriarchy theory a major social theory in current feminist culture, I think those comments confuse and cheapen what a feminist mean. "

Blindocide,TumblrInAction,1389113193.0,"I was wracking my brain for a health problem, like being fat, that can only happen by a systematic neglect of stopping it from happening.

Sure, some people are born with a genetic disorder that makes them always feel hungry. Some people are born with a genetic disorder to blah blah blah that makes their body unable to regulate to a normal body weight.

but other than that, you *become* fat, by eating poorly and having poor exercise habits. 

The only other thing that happens like that is *infection*. Like, I'm waiting for ""filthshaming"" to happen so people can attempt to justify the fact that they have open, pussy sores all over their body.

Or like, someone saying they don't appreciate being shamed for living in squalor and filth.

Like, fuck nigga, that shit is bad for you! And also you smell like shit.

The immediate counter argument I see to this is saying ""people who are dirty hurt others by spreading disease, fat people only harm themselves!"" and this is just a hilarious misunderstanding of how reality works.

by being fat, you fundamentally require more energy to upkeep your body than you would if you were not fat. This is basic thermodynamics.  You also take up more space than you would if you were not fat.

This is not a fact, but I'm assuming you require more time to accomplish tasks like walking, and rarely if ever break into a jog to improve the ergonomics of a social situation. The second is a near fact, I've never seen a single fat person jog across a street to clear themselves out of traffic out of respect for the drivers. 

Well, to be honest, I don't see many people (in New Orleans, Louisiana, America) doing that whatsoever. Actually, it's just me. I'm the only one I know who does that.

The bottom line is: you make the rest of our lives less efficient. inefficiency is not as good as efficiency. In every way you can describe a working system in terms of efficiency, being efficient is better than not being efficient.

so you probably shouldn't eat require more food than others, more space than others, or more time than others, unless you have a disability.

This is when people say that fat is a disability.

*sigh*.

However, in my experience, and this is also what my grandmother has always told me, ""The longer you live, the more you become yourself.""

The question you might want to ask yourself is, what would it take to change your mind? To change the emotions and feelings you have about  not having kids toward having them?

Personally, I have never wanted children, but I thought I would have to have them at some point because it's what you do. Or so I thought. The closer and closer I got to actually going through with it, the more and more upset I got. Mind you, I was in my thirties, married and under a load of pressure from both families and my husband to give in.

But I couldn't do it. 

The reasons were many and the logic was sound, but the fundamental truth was I just. didn't. want to. 

Has anyone ever suggested the flipping a coin trick? 

What you do is take a coin. Heads you will have kids, tails you won't, then flip it an see what side comes up. And pay really close attention to your instinctive, gut reaction to the result.

That will tell you very clearly how you really feel."

Ovviamente, non puoi dare giudizi definitivi su qualcuno senza conoscerlo bene, ma se questo qualcuno dimostra di essere uno che ci casca ogni volta che gli si mette davanti l'articolo finto per creare indignazione et similia, allora mi preoccupo. 

Non è per quello che viene condiviso che mi ""indigno"", ma perché la cultura non rientra nell'universo di valori di queste persone. Magari saranno madri amorevoli, gran lavoratori, grandi amici o quello che vuoi, ma quando manca la voglia di informarsi, capire e cercare la verità, allora c'è un problema.

Di persone come Cinzia che se ne fottono di capire è piena l'Italia. Queste persone votano un partito politico perché gli sta simpatico il leader, anche se è un pluripregiudicato. Queste persone vanno in giro a lanciare occhiate schifate ai ""negri di merda"" perché hanno letto che a Lampedusa questi prendono più soldi di un pensionato italiano. Queste persone difendono gli animaletti pucciosi dai complotti dei ricercatori che, evidentemente, vogliono solo il male per i cuccioli e ci godono a vivisezionarli. Cinzia non se lo chiede da dove viene l'antidolorifico che manda giù ogni volta che ha il ciclo.

Qua sta l'ipocrisia che citavo nel mio post.

Addendum - Riguardo al sentirsi superiori: io non condivido questa roba su FB, ma questo di certo non mi rende migliore di Cinzia. Io rappresento il [NEET](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET) per eccellenza, mentre Cinzia e il suo compagno lo stipendio a casa lo portano, fanno l'amore come le persone normali, un giorno avranno figli e avranno una vita normale.

Thanks for overlooking the obvious part of the wiki page: ""As a senior in 2003–2004, he rushed for 2,960 yards on 252 attempts, an average of 11.7 yards per carry, and 32 touchdowns.[2] After a game, players from the other team asked for his autograph.[11] Following Maurice Clarett's unsuccessful attempt to sue the NFL over its age limit in 2004, there was considerable debate over whether any high school football player might be able to make the leap from the preps to the pro game.

averag3j03,nfl,1389113812.0,"I'm an American, but I have played rugby for years and I love both sports, but they are very different to me. 

A paraphrased quote from the tv show *The West Wing* helps to describe, in my opinion the biggest difference in regards to the spectators:

""I love sports, I just can't get next to hockey. See, I think Americans like 
to savour situations. One down, bottom of the ninth, one run game, first and third, left 
handed batter, right hand reliever, infield at double play depth, here's the pitch. But 
scoring in hockey seems to come out of nowhere.""

Hockey is rugby in this analogy and football is baseball. NFL football often times comes down to dramatic, key plays at the end of the game, or even decisive plays in individual drives. You can pinpoint themost important plays in a highlight reel, and although there is scoring that ""comes out of nowhere"" as well, the suspense of certain situations is what sells tickets for many people."

If that's what necessary to get your point heard, be all means go for it. Expected this too.

&gt; &gt; It's usually a sign that objectivity regarding valid points aren't able to be conjured by the one using force.

&gt; That was a nice attempt at sounding good, but it didn't actually end up being grammatically correct or making any sense.

I should have said isn't, rather than aren't. When an argument can't be debated on points the volley becomes more about the person or their behavior, rather than the topic in order to draw a distraction. Expected.

&gt; &gt; If an argument isn't effective without profanity and/or force, what do you have to stand on?

&gt; Who says it wasn't effective without?

It's a presumption that an argument without basis that also includes grand adjectives and profanity to debase won't be effective in debate...certainly not in a graded debate. Your statements had little citation and more of the other.

&gt; &gt; Frankly what I expect is more profanity, a move towards name calling and down voting which has already happened. Have at it. I'm still right.

&gt; Is ""troll"" a name? Maybe.

Yep. Expected again.

&gt; &gt; The idea that Apple hardware costs 8x more than anyone else is sensationalist at the least.

&gt; Yes, it is, and it's incredibly easy to disprove, yet you still managed to fail to do so. Great job.

No. I didn't fail at all. I offered one article, a blog post that relates to this original post:

[http://www.futurelooks.com/new-apple-mac-pro-can-build-better-cheaper-pc-diy-style/](http://www.futurelooks.com/new-apple-mac-pro-can-build-better-cheaper-pc-diy-style/)

I could offer a number of links to all sorts of things from throughout the years to further justify my position. I'm sure you and others can do more research. This is just one article that shows 8x is folly. That's enough for me. I'm not here to placate others. This is Reddit. Not a place that warrants a great deal of effort for any real gain of any sort. Not worth the time to do much more than I have.

Though, you've managed to not offer any citation and also, met every expectation I had. If you want to challenge this and prove me wrong, do it. Just saying I'm wrong or the article is wrong is fluff without something empirical. I offered the article as one that proves 8x is not true. There are plenty others. So since you debase that article, would you care to elaborate on how it's wrong on a point by point basis since that's how the original article is written? And since I'm offering it to debase the ""8x,"" could you show us how that debasement is also untrue, even if the numbers are bit askew? Surely an intelligent person would gather that with some very smart discount shopping, one could potentially build a PC cheaper than the Mac Pro. Still at that price, the Mac Pro wouldn't be 8x higher than a PC.

Why exactly did you choose to chime in on a thread to argue something so trivial save to throw about some profanities and trivial debasement? That seems a bit more troll like than what I've done. I'm not calling you a troll however as I've looked at your profile and you are intelligent. Just not sure why you choose to pick on my post.

To each there own.

You can never have too many white dress shirts. Other colors are light blue, blue chambray, OCBD in solid colors, and potentially a few patterned shirts if you feel a bit adventurous.

Peacoat, topcoats, and season clothing depending on where you live. Would also be a good idea to get a weekender.

SuitSupply and J. Crew Ludlow are good places to start. Have yourself measured so you know exactly how you'll size. Basics such as sweaters, OCBD, undershirts, underwear, etc should be picked up at Uniqlo.

The last thing you want to do when sliding at 100mph is to start tumbling. The current trend of Curb + Turf (to prevent a running wide advantage) followed by a large swath of Tarmac is much preferable to the large deep gravel traps. 

Conversely, Gravel traps are better for cars for the same reasons they are bad for bikes. They grab the car and slow it much faster than than ""smooth"" tarmac or grass would.

All that aside I personally think the Curb &gt; Grass &gt; Tarmac is the best solution for everyone for the reasons he mentions. Making running slightly off the track a non race ending foible is a good thing. "

The fact that I said specifically that all the men I know don't talk about it as a concept and most likely don't think about it as an actual thing shows that I have at least something to stand on in this regard.

What else could you be saying that I have nothing to go on? 

Because I said that this is a useless third wave feminist piece that's essentially saying that men are bags of shit if they want to develop a greater relationship with girls that they already have relationships of some sort with?

What about the idiocy in regard to ""men who don't want to be around someone who's rejected the development of the relationship obviously never cared about the woman to begin with/ are selfish and sexist and juvenile""?

Carpet bombing cities wouldn't be a good way to do that. Having ""military grade"" weaponry like the AR-15 or the AK-47 (and I use quotes because let's face it, in most cases your long gun is not as good as the military issued ones) in the instance of fighting against the government is extremely practical because while they COULD blow up a city and move on they can't kill off 50% of the population and expect to be able to have a foundation to stand on.

As for private spaces (such as someone's home), I believe consent is required regardless of whether you distribute. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that's why secret recordings (both voice and video) cannot be used as evidence.

Console games are much more optimized than PC games because the consoles themselves are closed systems. If you're developing for the PS4, then you can tailor make your software to function efficiently on that console because every single PS4 on the planet uses the exact set of hardwear.

You cannot do the same for a PC because the PC userbase is incredibly fractured. Developers can't really make hardwear-specific optimizations to their products as a result.

You *cannot* compare PC and console specs on a 1:1 ratio. Consoles get more out of their hardwear than a PC does. You can always build a PC that gets much better performance than a console, but it's going to cost more."

Now if you are talking about current European limited monarchies, I suppose I see not much of an issue with what you are saying.

I relish the burn because it is a direct indicator that I am going to feel confident and reasonably happy tomorrow. Even if I do nothing in a day, I can still feel the soreness in my arms and thighs that remind that I did something productive and constructive in the past and am more than capable of doing it again.

Also, I started cooking nice food recently. Not because I want to impress, or because of the food itself, but simply because I enjoy how I can lose myself in the act of cooking. It's nice to be able to forget my cares and worries and focus solely on the temperature of the pan before I toss my eggs in, or marvel at how the spices mix so excellently on the taste buds to create a veritable cornucopia of flavor. As a college student subsisting almost entirely on cheap, prepackaged food, I am now learning that I can create tastier, healthier food that is cheaper? Thats incredible! And the complements when cooking for friends are nice as well. Tiny confidence spice ontop of a fat, confidence pie. With lots of butter.

I want to give some input because my wife and I are going through something similar but with the roles reversed. She is so wrapped up in how much she loves me that she gets anxious and over shares to the point that she dumps a lot of her insecurities on me that I don't really cause. It drives an emotional wedge between us and causes me to be distant from her even when I don't want to be.

Don't make your insecurities her problem. If you drink too much and it causes her to be upset, then fix that. If you talk too much and it drives her away from you then figure out how to adjust your communication to where she can actually hear what you are trying to say versus putting up barriers to not have the insecurity affect her as well.

Don't tell her how much you are afraid of losing her, don't tell her all the internal thoughts that are worrying you so much. Talk to her and genuinely apologize for what you said upset her, and then talk to her about how you want to focus on positive changes between the two of you and ask her what she thinks would bring you two closer.

Some people seem to dwell way too much on potential negative aspects of the relationship instead of focusing instead of building up the strengths that bring each other closer to one another.

Listen to her if she tells you she needs some space to not be upset anymore, and then GIVE IT TO HER. Tell her that you want to give her time to process things and if she wants to talk afterward that you want to listen to HER once she feels able to talk to you. Then actually listen to her when she is ready to talk. Don't counter points she makes with one of your own. Ask her why she feels the ways she says she does if you don't understand so that way you can build a deeper understanding of how she thinks and how she receives communication from you.

Don't make this about you. Make it about her. 

Also - work on your own insecurities. Those are relationship killers. Make yourself a better person that you feel is worthy of her if you don't already feel that you are.

Good luck friend. Feel free to ask me questions if you appreciate the input. "

Hitech_hillbilly,Tennesseetitans,1389114979.0,"This past year was his first year full time as a OC, so there were many hiccups and growing pains. He took over last year mid-november when Palmer was fired. [We went 2-4 after that.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Tennessee_Titans_season#Regular_season) Before that, he was the team's QB coach for a few years. 

His playcalling tended to be very conservative and during game threads it would be very common to see many fans complaining of Run Run Pass Punt series. 

Late in games, he was pretty good at getting aggressive and I believe with a better QB than Fitz that he could have actually orchestrated more wins this season. I think with Manning, he could be pretty good as long as he gets more aggressive and stops being so conservative in the playcalling. His late game playcalling didn't lose us those games. Fitz being an idiot and forcing stuff lost it for us. He needs more confidence in his plays and his offense and I think he can be good.  

A major complaint that most Titans fans have is that he failed to be creative in getting Chris Johnson the ball and called many runs with CJ going up the middle even when defenses were stuffing those and the OLine wasn't blocking well enough. With a power back like Greene in there, those plays had more success (forgive me but I didn't watch many Giants games this year so idk what your RB situation is). "

Largest I have seen is over at ISN with 220m/hr with heavy contests, though our average is 180m/hr (all of these are without calculating lp to isk)

&gt;How easy is it to get into a group in Logi with V? with a shiny ship?

Fairly easy, just need to x up in whatever community you want to run with, since you mentioned Logi V and shiny, I would recommend ISN (Incursion Shiny Network) found at ""ISN Secondary"" or our website http://www.eve-isn.com/ (website has our fits).  All you need to do is x up with the appropriate fit (assuming there is a fleet up) and the FC can walk you through anything you need (info is in the fleet motd, system, comms, etc)

&gt;Will I have better luck being picked up if I join an incursion corp?

As others have mentioned there are very few incursion corps, they are too easy to war dec so people made communities that operate out of their own channels.  If someone war decs us, we just hop corp to another and continue to run.

If you have any specific questions feel free to ask me (either here or in game, same name), I am an FC over at ISN

For those looking to get into incursions, here is a list of communities that run and their channels:

gazork_chumble_spuzz,bodyweightfitness,1389115471.0,"&gt;Then you come back home too late to exercise and tired after let's say playing football for 2 hours straight. What do you do in this situation?

Well, football is pretty good exercise, so I would give myself a day off the next day and probably just do some stretching or go for a walk if I felt like I needed to move around.

As for the meals - try not to skip meals. It's a bad habit to get into. Your body needs fuel. One of the things I'm trying to change this year is to not skip meals, because if you skip enough meals you lose weight. And if you're trying to bulk up you will shoot yourself in the foot if you let that become a regular issue. If you miss a meal or two a week, that ads up. If you know you'll be away from home, bring food with you. Pack a healthy sandwich (I love wraps!! they're so much tidier than sandwiches on bread and they're delicious), and a container of sliced fruit and some vanilla or lemon yogurt to dip it in...it's an easy meal that's filling and healthy, and it travels well and won't be messy. And whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it'll work. Don't skip meals. Eat.

&gt;Do you workout day after (tuesday) and then thursday again or you just wait till thursday so u don't mess up the schedule or overtrain?

Given that you already do Thursday and Friday back-to-back I would definitely just wait until Thursday. It won't set you back."

Don't put your GF on a pedestal. Don't demand what she isn't yet ready to give. Let your relationship grow organically. Be comfortable in your own skin.

Those things are part of the foundation of truly equal and beneficial relationships. 

Don't let desperation drive away someone you love. Appreciate what she gives to you, and let her know how much you do. Focus on building up things that make you both happy and content. Observe things that make you feel insecure and deeply analyze them before you discuss any of it with her.

If it is something she actually does that contributes to it then it may be time to discuss it. If it is something that is only in your head then don't burden her with it. Figure out why your mind thinks that way and work on it from your own side before you ask for her help.

The paper is interesting because it is a case study of two people who took tegretol (carbamazepine). One possessed absolute pitch (as I believe I do) and one did not. Both experienced a shift of about 1 semitone, and my own shift was almost that much but not quite. The one with perfect pitch discontinued medication (as I did), and the one without got used to it after a while (which I doubt I could, as it was extremely disconcerting).

To your credit, the paper does say this:
&gt;Those who do not possess absolute pitch may not notice their shifted pitch perception, and even if they are aware of it they may easily become attuned to the new shifted pitch. If the patients are unable to describe the exact nature of their auditory disturbance, they might express it in such a way as to make psychiatrists recognize it as depersonalization or even a delusional mood. If our supposition is correct, pitch perception shifts may not be a rare side-effect of carbamazepine, but an overlooked side-effect.

Which is interesting."

sir_sri,AdviceAnimals,1389116274.0,"&gt;Do you even need to do your taxes? 

Generally yes, if you have any income.  

&gt;What are the forms?

What country do you live in?   Either a government office (usually a post office) or the tax collection agency of your country will tell you via their website.  

&gt;I realize for an adult who has been dealing with this stuff for awhile it's painfully obvious, but for a kid fresh out of school with zero experience it can be quite confusing. 

No it really wasn't.  I went to the post office, I picked up the forms, I did my taxes and my parents taxes.  I'll presume you're american because 'muricans seem to have this problem, and in that case I don't know if the post office would have IRS tax forms or not. 

&gt; It's the same with insurance, bank accounts, credit cards, student loans, car registration, job applications and a zillion other things adults have to deal with but no one ever teaches you about.

You do know how to read right?  Education isn't about handholding you through a government service office, it's about giving you the skills you need to navigate them on your own.  

It's not like adults had some magical training in how to do this stuff, the education system did not hand hold them through things.  To some limited extent parents might be helpful guides, but lots of people have parents from other countries who are completely oblivious.  You do stuff, and solve problems as you go, you show up, you read.  The question of the thread was 'why don't they teach us this...' rather than  'how do I'... Believe it or not that's most how you learn.  You get a job, you ask people  older than you who do stuff what they needed to do.  My mother had no idea how to retire (the actual paperwork), not exactly the sort of thing they'd teach in highschool anyway.  How did she figure it out?  She asked someone who retired before her, who in turn had asked someone who retired before them etc.  

&gt;Should I get a payday loan if I need cash? Yes I know they're a horrible deal but a lot of people don't realize that initially because no one told them.

Did you learn how to do math?  Then you know how to assess if a payday loan is suitable for your problem or not.  I grant that if you didn't learn how to do math, or how to make friends with people who know how to do math and ask them for advice life seems challenging, but it's really not hard. 

Read, do math, if you can't figure it out ask someone who has likely been through it for advice on how.  "

eetsumkaus,malefashionadvice,1389116524.0,"well, here I want to draw the line between spending *less* and being *frugal*. It's entirely possible to spend less on luxuries, yes. But what changed my mind in that thread is that a lot of people view being frugal as mutually exclusive with luxuries. That is, the alternative to a luxury, is no luxury. Simple as that. It is a luxury for a reason because you don't *need* it. 

That being said, buying a shitty $20 sweater from H&amp;M because you like how it looks falls into the realm of luxury. Buying a $120 Thorogood boot because you have no other boots does not. Buying $500 Trickers because the leather creases better, is also a luxury. Frugal is more about *what* you buy than how much you pay for it. If you buy anything more than what you need to be functional and successful in society, then that's not being frugal. Anything from Norse Projects is a luxury. There are shirts and knits for less that are just as durable, though the material may not feel as good, and the designs aren't as cool.

I did say that I wanted to donate to the Spanish republicans, for a few reasons.  Firstly, I dated a Catalan girl for a long time, who HATED the Spanish royal family.  And it turns out they are a bunch of corrupt thieves, who do not bring dignity or unity (I mean shooting elephants when you country has 50% youth unemployment?) to that nation.  So I admit I feel stronger on that monarchy than others, and thus would actively want to do something.

Would I donate to UK republicans?  Most likely not.  I lived in London, its a free country, most people support the Queen.  Are the Scottish as supportive of her?  I don't think so.  It may even be driving the independence move somewhat. 

That being said, I still have a philosophical issue with it.  I do not think humans should be born into a legally recognized status, besides that of citizen (this is besides any perceived benefit to the country).  Just as it was wrong in the US to have people born into the status of slave.  In this statement, I'm not only discussing the high royal family, but the nobility as well.  As where one can claim that the Queen and her family do confer benefits, I fail to see what benefits random Barons and so forth bring to the table.  To me, it also seems strange to have the essence of a country embodied in a human being, and her line of descendants.

Instead of giving them more intensive work they just flat out give them more work, as to take up all of their time. This results in unhappy students who are only in school to get a grade and nothing more. 

Not to mention schools today (US mostly) kill creativity. In any class other than art, you are expected to do something the exact way the teacher requires, anything else you are graded lower. 

Not to mention diffrent schools have diffrent grading polocies. The public school I went to last year made everyone take English Honors (it was just regular English). Along with grade inflation (AKA making classes easier so everyone does better) the public school system has become much easier to succeed in. I am at a disadvantage by going to private school, because I am guaranteed to get a lower GPA by doing more work on a harder scale. If I took equivalent level classes in public school my grades would be much higher, not to mention I would have more free time. "

""Hey you, what are you doing in my trash can?""

""Just collecting paper to build some wax fire starters. Definitely not looking for personally identifiable information.""

If you have to put your trash can down at the corner of your driveway on the public road by your logic you don't have any right to tell the dumpster diver to shove off and leave your trash alone. You'd basically have to provide a service (similar to recycling) that would properly dispose of all sensitive documents for you, and in that case you're just making it even easier to sort out your trash from the paperwork you don't want people to see.

There's also another privacy element: not everything everyone throws away as trash is something they want other people to acquire. Imagine a girl tears a pair of her favorite panties and throws them in the trash bag. That creepy old dude down the street checks her trash every week when she puts it on the curb and now he's just hit the jackpot. It could make for an extremely uncomfortable situation for a female when weirdo starts stealing her undergarments and tampons. Imagine you have a daughter and apply the mentioned situation, I would see that causing problems. By your logic, though, it's perfectly legal.

A lot of people probably don't look at their trashcan and consider their own privacy and what they're throwing out, but when people started digging into it every week I bet most would start getting uncomfortable fairly quickly.

nowthatihavefoundyou,MakeupAddicts,1389118301.0,"Which TANtalizer product are you referring to? I have the duo (highlight and bronzer compact). They are perfect! The highlighter gives the best glow with out looking frosty or unnatural.  The bronzer is matte with absolutely no glitter or shimmer so it's perfect for contouring and warming up the face at least for me.

Here is LORAC's problem: LORAC is a mid-range line, but so is UD, Benefit, Kat Von D. The difference is those lines have a broader appeal to Sephora's younger customers who shop mid-range products due to the fresh, hip packaging. The LORAC packaging is not as flashy as the others, which may appeal to older customers, but older customers lean toward the high-end lines over mid-range. LORAC needs to either redesign the packaging for a fresh, unique look to meet the demands of mid-range customers or deliver high-end products with high-end packaging to stay current in the competitive cosmetic market. 

Side note: I LOVE the eyeshadows in the LORAC PRO palette. My one complaint is while the packaging brand new looks nice, but it gets very dirty, dingy overtime and it is not easy to clean up to look ""new"" again. "

PlushieChomby,AdviceAnimals,1389118432.0,"Unless you immediately tell your partner you've fallen in love with someone else, you're hiding your feelings from them, deceiving them into believing you're happy staying monogamous with them, and lying to yourself and partner about the state of your relationship. I'm sorry I had to walk you through that, but it didn't seem like you could realize that yourself. 

And yes, actively developing feelings for another person (which robs your actual relationship of intimacy by focusing your desires elsewhere) while deceiving your partner into staying in a relationship with you is *indeed* considered cheating by mature adults who understand the dynamics of a healthy relationship and don't personally ascribe to polygamy. (I've known mature polygamists - healthy relationships for them are a whole different ballgame with varying sets of rules and beliefs about what works for them.) 

Edit to include this: Falling in love with someone takes effort; it doesn't happen at a glance - that's lust disguised as love. But if you feel that lust disguised as love and think it's actually love, go home, tell your partner how you feel and talk about what it means for the relationship, I wouldn't qualify it as cheating, though there may be those who do. Taking action that further develops those feelings for the third party leads you down the cheating hole and brings the deceit, lies and betrayal of your current partner into the relationship. It's true that people feel a physiological need to experience those feelings of new love every five to seven years or so, but the grass is greenest where you water it - and if you've chosen the patch on the other side of the fence, you've consciously chosen to start harming the relationship you're actually in, whether you realize it or not. That's when you start cheating on your partner, not just when you start lusting after someone else - when you start feeding it and taking intimacy away from your current relationship to focus on a third party when you should be mature by talking it out with said partner or breaking it off with them.

ballookey,exjw,1389118449.0,"That's something I'd like to test out if I can get someone who believes in spirits. What if the board were hidden from them, so they couldn't see the message as it was spelled out? If the spirit is the one communicating, it shouldn't matter.

This is akin to the facilitated communication thing that went around amongst parents of non-verbal autistic children a while back. A ""facilitator"" would sort of hold the hand of the autistic child while they pecked at a keyboard. The child alone would produce gibberish. A non-""facilitator"" using a similar technique with the child would produce gibberish. But with a trained ""facilitator"" suddenly the children could apparently communicate, answer questions, articulate feelings and desires. Parents were over the moon with joy.

The facilitators asserted that one had to be a trained ""facilitator"" for it to work. But it all fell apart (similar to an episode of Law &amp; Order where it was dramatized) if a child was shown an image that the facilitator could not see, then was asked to type out what the image was. 

The answers were always wrong. They weren't gibberish because the facilitator was trying to type some kind of answer. Perhaps they even believed the child was the one directing the communication. But the answers were wrong.

This is the kind of way one must approach supernatural things like Ouija boards. If the spirits don't want to work through me because I don't believe in them (which, by the way, is a lost opportunity to convince me of their existence, but OK), then one has to come up with protocols to eliminate the chance that believers are influencing the results directly, either consciously or unconsciously.

When such controls are in place, it doesn't work. So what are we to believe? The spirits are like talking dogs, who only talk to their owners when they're alone, but clam up when others are around? Or are they entirely in the mind of the believer?

One of these is FAR more likely than the other. "

Damage can range from puffiness, bags, circles, bruised feeling, dry irritated skin, and damage from allergies (rubbing and tears). I don't normally take advice from people who are trying to sell me a product, but I think this lady was actually being pretty nice. Concealer is cheaper, but you're just going to cover up the damage being done to your skin. It's like putting on your base makeup without moisturing and cleansing first. WHY!? So, this serum is usually applied before bed when I notice my skin under the eyes is not healthy (which makes me look raccoony). The next morning doesn't vanish the problem, but about 2-3 days in my skin heals up and I can stop applying concealer to the area. I still have the first bottle I bought for about 45$ or 50$ a few years later. I bring it out whenever I stop sleeping properly or my allergies kick in. I definitely recommend it. Puffy eyes with dark circles are damaged skin, and not something you should just cover up.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,IAmA,1389118952.0,"Here's how I think of it:

If it's cold outside, I don't expect the sun to come out just for me just because I want to be warm. Would you expect that of the sun? Of course not. On the other hand, I bet both of us would be happy to go out and buy ourselves jackets, right? You might buy an expensive jacket, while I might buy a cheap jacket. Doesn't matter because they're both warm and they both get the job done. We find different value in different things and that's great. Meanwhile, the sun is just gonna keep going with the flow.

It's human nature to want things in a very self-centered and often superficial way. Markets are at the whim of human nature. Anyone wanting to make money needs to understand this. In my opinion it's actually ""the creatives"" who act entitled, and here's why:

If I know damn well that people are going to pirate my hard work, why would I ever follow that career path unless I was 100% okay with relying upon an unreliable market to pay my bills for me? I wouldn't. It's risk vs reward. Piracy has been a clear threat for a long time. We've seen it coming. We've been living with it for years. Piracy is like a thunderstorm: it's beautiful from afar and it sucks when it's raining on you. But we live with thunderstorms every day without demanding that the sun dry up all the rain for us. Going into a low-demand ""creative"" field and then expecting success is like expecting the sun to dry up all the rain. Stupid and entitled. No, the world does not need another porn video, and no, the world does not need another video game, movie, TV show or software tool. We'll all be just fine without them.

I can live without Siri's latest porn video. I wouldn't buy it even if it was only available on VHS. I just don't care enough about it to make it worth buying, and on top of that there is plenty of material out there for me to get off to as it is due to forces that are completely out of both parties' control. The same goes for video games, music, software, etc. If I don't care about it enough to buy it then it doesn't matter if it's free or not...a company will never *ever* get my money for it because I will be perfectly content without it. On the other hand, if it is accessible online for the cost a few seconds of my time and some risk to my PC then sure, I might click a link and download it and maybe even use it later. Chances are though that it will sit on my hard disk untouched.

A different person, on the other hand, may not be able to live without Siri's latest anal expedition. Another person may be stupid enough to buy her DVD merely because it exists!! We all know someone like that... Another person may *desperately* need to play that latest video game, or *require* that latest new album on their iWhack, or *must* have that neat new selfie-editing program...so they go out and buy them. Good for them! I'm happy they have enough money to make their threshold of *need* so incredibly low. They will hopefully be happy with their purchase and enjoy the benefits of ownership. I, on the other hand, will continue about my life as if the products in question never existed in the first place.

The film was not released with the post-scene footage, as that would clearly defeat the purpose, I think they said they kep filming just in case law enforcement investigation.

Also, I think the ""don't ever change your sens"" advice is a load of horse shit, at least in the long (and very short) term. I'm always hearing about high level players (in both TF2 and CS, the latter being a much harder game in terms of aiming) changing their sensitivity after awhile of using it.

rednail64,jobs,1389119074.0,"Thanks for sharing - I understand your frustration and hopefully writing some of this out helped you a little bit. 

When your resume doesn't do a lot to help you stand out, you're going to need to think about shifting your strategy.  Applying to thousands of openings is a numbers game, especially in this still-sluggish economy.  Of course, you've got to have an online search component, but if your entire search strategy consists of bombing out applications, that's perhaps the least effective way of getting hired short of being a superstar.

You might need to consider adding more networking into your search strategy.  Connecting, with friends, family, alumni, people at the gym, whatever, *who could get to know you and understand your value is more than what is seen on a piece of paper*.  

Can you tell me if you've been doing anything like this, and if so, how it has worked (or not)?

The other concern that you noted is your upcoming travel holiday.  That sounds like a great opportunity to get clear on what it is that you want to do, but it will put your search on hold until you get back.

The other thing you may need to consider is simply pulling up stakes and moving to an area with better employment opportunities.  That's how our grandparents did it."

superspeck,HomeImprovement,1389119216.0,"Well, it's up to you. Do you plan to sell the house any time soon? If it's obvious that work has been done (e.g. new window units obviously don't match those on the rest of the house) then the buyer, inspector, or appraiser might want to see those permits and might walk away from the deal if they aren't. There might also be other legal complications with refinancing your home or your current mortgage. I can't evaluate those things for you. 

Back on the other hand if you own your home and you don't plan to sell it, you might decide the risk that the municipality would come down on you hard is too much, and you choose to just roll with it. I can't choose those things for you either. 

It's also a safety issue. You say that you had to be there to correct how the workers were doing things. Based on not knowing how the permitting process works, it doesn't sound like you're experienced with home renovation beyond, probably, basics or things you see on TV. While you can learn a lot from those shows, climates can vary pretty widely in CA (from marine to desert, alpine, and back) and there are a lot of little technical details that matter as your climate zone number goes up. I wouldn't want a builder doing the type of work you describe to a building that faces the ocean or is on a hillside exposed to the Santa Ana winds for a variety of reasons, mainly un-permitted structural work and details regarding flashing, electrical, and other stuff. If I was somewhere that was calm and relatively balmy all year round and wasn't ever exposed to strong winds, I might let it slide, but I definitely wouldn't let it slide if I was in an extreme environment. 

The most likely thing that's going to happen at this point, which should be another point of view that you need to look at this from, is that if you call the city and they red-tag the work, the contractor is going to walk instead of doing what the city wants him to do, which is tearing the work apart again and exposing the aforementioned details, then re-doing the work to close it in again. 

I mean, it's up to you. This could open a big can of worms, because it's your responsibility to see that those permits were pulled as the homeowner, even if you have a contract that says otherwise. The building department might fine you as the homeowner and you would have to chase the contractor through the courts to recoup costs of the fines plus the cost of opening up and re-doing work as needed. City building inspectors also guarantee that the work meets minimum safety requirements, and having done those inspections mean that you maintain your investment in your property. "

Perfume making - bam! Get some raw materials and extract that shit!

Paper making - bam! Put some paper bags through the shredder and blend that shit with herbs!

Funny post card making - bam! Gather up magazines and ads hanging around and get the envelopes with stuff I've already cut out and glue together some funny collages - then send them to friends randomly and make them go WTF?

Science Fiction Writing - all of my ideas are in a single folder under _WRITING in my file system and organized by type. I can create a new file there with a new story inspiration and then grab ideas I've saved in the past. Maybe write just one chapter. Or just one idea.

I just gave a good friend all of my oil paints because I hadn't touched them in like 3 years and realized that I wasn't really into oil painting but prefer sketching and water color instead. So, I kept that shit.

Anyone with the slightest existing crack in their faith is going to look at these gymnastics and really start to wonder if this is god's chosen organization.

conspirized,changemyview,1389120054.0,"&gt; the vast majority of citizens do NOT live in any kind of fear of the police.

I disagree. People are afraid of the police and prison, and that is why these same people follow laws regardless of whether or not they are morally significant by their own standards.

As a simple example: think of your immediate reaction when you're driving down the highway and you see a police officer. Your first reaction is going to be to check your speed and possibly tap your brakes if you assess you're either going too fast or simply not slow enough to avoid the officer's attention. You're passing the police officer now, and you continue to watch him in your rear view mirror. He pulls out and he's now behind you. You weren't speeding, so what is he following you for? For an agonizing fifteen minutes you ride along just barely driving the speed limit and constantly wondering what you've done to warrant the attention until finally he pulls off at his exit, and the fear is lifted.

If you're lucky that's where your fear ends: simple compliance. If you've had a run in with the police before, even for a crime you didn't commit, you've likely learned a much greater fear of the ""long arm of the law."" Everyone is afraid of the police, I would even go as far as to say the law abiding citizen moreso than anyone else. They just convince themselves they don't need to be afraid because they're already scared enough to be compliant."

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389120123.0,"So in Judaism you can't talk about lost arts without talking about tekhelet.  It's a blue dye used in various ritual objects.  Besides things in the Temple, it was used in the *tzitzit*, a sort of fringe that goes on a ritual garment, the *tallit* (I'm going to avoid rambling off-topic about this--if you're curious, ask).  It was lost in antiquity.  After the Temple was destroyed and most of the community was exiled, a lot of the ritual infastructure for things like that died off.  While the dye persisted for a few centuries after, it eventually was lost in the centuries immediately following the Talmud.  However, Jewish texts give several important facts about it:

1. The dye comes from a Mediterranean snail
* The snail has a shell
* The snail is fish-like
* The snail is rare
* Its color is like indigo, though it is not made from it
* It is expensive

Because of its relevance in Judaism, people have tried to identify it.  An incorrect one was the cuttlefish--it turns out the dye made from it has nothing to do with the cuttlefish, it's actually the Prussian Blue artificial dye, using the cuttlefish as a source of organic material.  And the important bit about the dye is the animal it comes from.

However, this happily falls into the third category!  Someone eventually tried a snail that fit the bill, the *hexaplex trunculus*.  And more importantly, archeologists have found evidence of that snail used in Near-Eastern dye production.  It's actually the same animal that made the ancient royal purple, but with a slightly different process.  Importantly, it's known to have been used by other Canaanite groups, including the Phoenicians.  And based of a bit of dyed fabric, it seems that tekhelet was a dark, almost purple, blue color.  After all, it's said to be the color of indigo.

Whether or not people should use tzitzit dyed with this is an interesting question of Jewish law.  But either way you can buy them now.  Which is pretty cool.

Can we talk about obscure arts that aren't quite lost?  Chant hand-signalling is part of Jewish liturgy that's in grave danger in most communities."

I think it's just one of those things, the way I as a computer guy by trade want everything in email or tickets and don't want you talking to me directly. 

I do wish the industry was more friendly to consumers who aren't knowledgable. My county here in Texas has pretty good resources. 

Have you verified your contractor's license with the state? You can do that on the [state's licensing board website](http://www.cslb.ca.gov/). They might also be a good intermediate resource to ask what you should do about a contractor who apparently hasn't pulled city permits and make sure that any penalties get applied to him and not you. 

The problem is that many contractors who do shady practices, when they get slapped with something like this by a homeowner, just dissolve the LLC that holds the business license, and form a new LLC and pull a new license. I gather that the CA state licensing board is trying to stop that sort of practice, and are probably farther along in it than anyone else except IL and Mass.

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389120230.0,"I find contempt shuts people down a lot faster than anger. If I can react to people like they're being really weird and I just don't understand what on earth they're trying to accomplish and besides that they're mostly beneath my notice, they tend to get really self-conscious and back off. A skeptical ""Really?"" kind of look and then getting back to work, for example. Or when I'm feeling direct, a sighing kind of, ""Look dude, I really don't have time for this. Can you go bother someone else please?"" Say it with your attitude if you're not allowed to do it out loud, but you basically want to tap into your inner Mean Girl.

When on the street, I have what I call my ""city walk"" - I grew up an amiable country girl, but that just invites harassment in my neighborhood. So now I pick an imaginary target ahead of me and keep my eyes on that, then I practice good posture, lead from my center, and walk quickly and with purpose (like you're walking toward something important, not like you're running away). Think about how you would walk if you really, genuinely had stuff you had to get to and you couldn't be bothered by any distractions. Walk with that kind of focus. I find that if I have an actual point of focus, rather than just avoiding eye contact, people are more likely to leave me alone.

EDIT: An important note, because it took me a long time to quit doing this when I was 17: don't laugh at their jokes. Don't answer their questions. They are too drunk and/or too clueless to recognize subtlety in your tone. If someone keeps asking you questions, make it clear you aren't interested in talking by *not talking to them.* Often when strange men start talking to me, I just say, ""No thank you"" and keep walking, even if ""no thank you"" doesn't really make sense for the conversation. You can also try, ""Go back to your friends, please,"" or ""Goodbye"" or even ""I'm calling my parents now, so I suggest you leave me alone."" But DO NOT continue the conversation after that. Say your one dismissive thing and then keep walking. Your next move, if they don't leave you alone, is to either go looking for a bouncer (if they have one) or actually pull out your phone and call someone."

1.  A higher court may still overturn the ruling.
2.  The city needs time to figure out another scheme to regulate guns.

Assuming this passes muster with the Supreme Court, the politicians who supported the ban will try for a defacto ban through regulation.  (Like what Texas is trying to do for abortion.)

edit: this is the kind of discussion that makes me understand the arguments against changing the BCS. If arbitrary factors are allowed to trump the core value of getting the best teams on the field and basic seeding philosophy (seems to work for, idk, *every other major sport in the world*) then we risk taking a step backwards.

But wouldn't.  

The problem with teaching specific materials like this is they aren't persistent in time, and by the time your taxes include any sort of meaningful income you won't remember any of it anyway - or you'll have enough money to pay an accountant to do it for you.  

&gt; How do you know you need to do your taxes if no one tells you?

How can you live in an isolation bubble where you are never exposed to this information?  Between co-workers, the tax agency, the news, other  students who also have to file these are things that you have to wilfully not learn about.  

&gt;This may sound stupid but if taxes are taken out of your paycheck and you pay sales tax why would you presume you need to file taxes also?

Because it's all over the news every April (or whenever your country has taxes due) that people have to file them, and has been every year for the 16 or so years of your life before you get to the point of having any income at all. 

&gt;To me it would make more sense for schools to teach this than to teach cursive or macbeth.

Than cursive maybe, probably not than MacBeth simply because MacBeth as part of drama are part of cultural literacy.  

&gt;Not only that but we would be better as a society if people could do better for themselves.

Only to a point - like everything else.  There's a value in specialization of labour.  But it's not like you can't do taxes coming out of highschool, so long as you learned to read.  "

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389121076.0,"That question is much narrower.  It's just asking about European armies from the Middle Ages.  While it's still pretty broad, it's a narrow enough scope to be within one area of knowledge.  ""Antiquity"" stretches over thousands of years, and there's no specified geographic area.

Perhaps more importantly, the other question is asking for a specific comparison of militaries.  This question is essentially asking for a list of examples.  It's a matter of having one answering discussion (what differed between armies in the two periods) and many (discussions of all battles that are upsets).  This is the specific issue addressed in the rules:

&gt;Our guiding principle is that if a thread can be summarised as ""tell me random stuff about X through history"" then it falls into this category of trivia rather than looking for in-depth answers which is this community’s main focus. Questions likely to be removed are those asking about all history and all places at once. If your question includes the phrase ""In your area of expertise"" strongly reconsider posting it, or making it more specific. Instead, any questions that are looking for trivia or for extremely general topics should turn to our weekly Meta threads; the Friday-Free-for-All thread in particular is well suited to many of these questions, as is the Tuesday Trivia thread. Many general questions have been well explored in the past, and you might find lots of interesting information in the archive of both Tuesday Trivia and Friday Free-for-All threads.

The issue is both the broad scope and that you're asking for a collection of examples."

sir_sri,AdviceAnimals,1389121106.0,"&gt;Again, I think we should teach history.

Yes, because with history you need someone to tell you the relevant parts to be cultural literate.  You could hand someone a list and they'd be off and running if they would do the readings on their own.

Which is exactly how income tax works.  You're taught how to read and do math you have the skills to go read it.

&gt;A lot of kids just don't give a shit and no matter how accessible these things are outside of school they'd rather just play xbox than learn about them, thus we hold their hands through the basics in grade school.

Right, and if they're not going to learn details trying to teach them details that will be 5 years out of date before they need them isn't going to make much difference is it?

&gt;Well avoiding this would be the idea of teaching them about the basics in school..

Again though, we *do* teach them the basics in school.  They learn how to read and do math.  Everything else is up to them.

There's also a tendency for people to adopt/earn ""positions"" and it never goes well if you disagree with one of these titled members. The rest of the cast sycophantically tends to support this.

I'd recommend finding a list of 'quintessential' serials for each of 1-7 and watching those to get a feel for each character.

You said: 
&gt;  I would bet that most people would say it would require actual decieving, lying or hiding. You are actively cheating on your partner.

So I tried to help you get from point A to point B by pointing out: 

&gt;  Unless you immediately tell your partner you've fallen in love with someone else, you're hiding your feelings from them, deceiving them into believing you're happy staying monogamous with them, and lying to yourself and partner about the state of your relationship.

I don't know if you have the attention span of a gnat on caffeine or the inability to understand context, but I honestly can't think of a way to lay things out clearer than that. Especially since I went into detail on how the effort it takes to fall in love with someone else requires a level of cheating on your partner by robbing intimacy from the relationship in which it belongs. Sorry if you're still in the dark, but you've got to either gain the experience or understanding to put two and two together for yourself on this one, so I'm out - but feel free to comment again if you're the type who desperately needs to have the last word - I'll let you have it by not replying. \^_^"

In fact, I don't think I disagree with anything they said, I just disagree at the assessment of whether it's good or bad. I find I encounter a lot of that when I give my own advice as well. I think that's fundamentally a question of aesthetic tastes. In fact, I think the quality of the comments was what made me realize that I just like different things, because all of it made sense to me, I just find that each of the things they pointed out sat differently with me. 

It's not just the post though, it's basically the rest of MFA. Like, most of the Top of WAYWT posts I don't like, which is understandable. I understand logically why people would like it, but I can't quite feel the same way about them that most people do. Most of my favorite posts in WAYWT are actually buried at the bottom somewhere, at least if they're not deleted at all.

It is useful to go back and understand though, you're right. I do that often. And I think that's part of the reason I think I realized I might just like something different. The words that express what I'm trying to do sound a lot like the ones people use to describe what they're trying to do here (e.g. streetwear/heritage crossover, early 20's etc.) but I feel like it expresses itself differently visually.

My parents live in LA and my father and I share home improvement as a hobby, so I know some of the laws and issues but they're not at the tip of my mental tongue all the time. And you had structural work done. No, you want to call the building department and start working with them ASAP. You want to be very specific about what was changed -- structural, electrical, windows, exterior, and any plumbing or HVAC changes. 

The permit that your contractor wants to pull is a general renovation permit. It doesn't cover structural work like new window openings. I would say that new window openings in a state with a strict seismic code would carry a significant risk of damage without proper engineering. They skip a bunch of processes, but those processes are important in this case. 

In a state like mine, at most we have tornado and hurricane winds to deal with. That means that we have specific bolt schedules and sheathing requirements at the corners of the house and specific roofing tiedown requirements. Skipping inspection steps means that one of those things gets left off, because it takes a lot of time and effort to do some of the tasks, especially when retrofitting. Seismic standards are even more complex and time consuming. Failing to modify a wall system appropriately means that in a quake that part of the house might shake off the foundation or rack. 

I can't answer the question regarding insurance. All I can say is that the liability generally ultimately rests with the homeowner. Which doesn't help you if you're dead in a pile of rubble after a little 5.0 shocker in just the wrong direction. And that's why I always do everything to best practices, even if, as in the situation that I'm in right now, I'm not planning to stay at the house for very long.

Awkward_moments,AdviceAnimals,1389121939.0,"Being a younger Brit. I have only been taught metric at school. But I mix between metric and imperial for measurements around human standards. So like 8 or 18 stone probably makes more sense to me as its relatively close to my weight. But kg isnt a problem. And when it comes to feet Im more familiar with 6 foot. So if something in within about 30 feet its easier for me to picture body lengths and therefore feet. Actually distance in time is easier when using miles because thats our roads. So i know 70miles is an hour away but i dont know how long it would take me to travel 70km. Edit: (our motorways have 70mph speed limit thats why I used that number)

But then it breaks down after that. Anything less that a foot is in cm. 50 meters and more is metric. Weight is barbaric anyway so unless you talking about the weight of someone dont bother giving me pounds or stone. 

Trying to work out anything mathematically in imperial is useless. Its not only crap, you assume you are wrong because its such a shit system so people dont bother with that. Talking in imperial is only used in certain situations. 

Then to expect people to understand the backwards system of imperial on a multinational site. Thats the problem. It doesnt make sense. On this site I use metric for explaining stuff and I use metric and imperial for mentioning a fact. Lots of the time the imperial is for Americans benefit.

My kids will probably only experience people talking in imperial for miles (if they keep it) and pints (which is they try take away I will complain. 500ml fuck you i want that extra 68.2..ml. Beer is religion)"

However, there are consequences that come with this (the emotional discontent, break-ups, distress,  etc) that they cannot be considered immune to.

In a probably terrible analogy, it'd be like going out in public and punching someone in the face. Maybe I enjoy it, maybe I don't like not punching people, whatever, but I'm almost definitely going to face some consequences for it, so it isn't really a recommended course of action or a nice thing to do.

The term is used in classical sources (the LXX, Josephus) to talk about skilled wood craftsmen.  But there's no indication that it means some sort of special wood craftsman.

Most Greek dictionaries seem to say it means ""craftsman"" or ""woodworker"" or ""carpenter"".  I don't see any reason why it should imply anything about socioeconomic status, other than to note that Nazareth was rather rural, and not a particularly wealthy area."

rscynn,relationship_advice,1389122483.0,"I am almost 32 years old.

My wife has also gone through depression and issues with anxiety for most of her life. It still affects her and she is a year older than myself.

I used to deal with issues like that when I was closer to your age and managed to take care of most of them by the time I was 25 or so. Being self aware that you have a problem and working on resolving it for yourself (again - realize when it is within you and not because of her or the relationship) is the start.

Everyone has insecurities. I still have some. No person is 100% secure all the time. What makes the difference is how we expose those insecurities to others and those we love especially.

If you have abandonment insecurities due to something in your past (family, an ex, etc) then that is understandable, but directing those issues at the person that currently loves you facilitates breaking down the relationship and becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

My wife and I are struggling with that right now. I love her and I tell her that constantly, but somehow she still struggles with accepting it and believing it to the point that it is true for her. Her dealing with her insecurities is what we are working on right now. 

I might suggest that you lay out your insecurities to your girlfriend. With the preface of letting her know that she isn't the cause of them, but you want her help in dealing with them yourself. You have to do the internal work, but her making you feel safe and secure how she can will help facilitate that improvement. Just be careful on not asking for too much help when you truly need to deal with it internally. It can cause codependency issues that you don't want or need in a relationship.

Good luck brother."

ciov3r,changemyview,1389122652.0,"""The difference in ecological footprint between vegan and veggie isn't large enough to make the change from veggie to vegan"".

From that same [website](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet), the 'foodprint' difference between no-beef and vegetarian is not high either.

While I can't argue that a **whole-foods** vegan or vegetarian diet wouldn't be the most eco-responsible *on a very general scale*, I am not convinced that it's necessary to be quite so extreme to still make a considerable positive change.

As with anything, we just need to learn to be aware of where various products come from and take responsibility for our consumerism. Granted, there's an obvious benefit of consuming less *beef* in general. Whether grass-fed or factory raised, raising cattle definitely has an impact. It's healthier to consume more lean meat than beef anyway.

Other types of meat, such as chicken, or goat, or lamb, or whatever are easier to raise locally, humanely, and on less resources. As an example, my parents have a little over an acre of land, and successfully raise their own chickens, also using the eggs from those chickens.  They even harvest what waste they can from them to help with gardening, and the chickens are free range and keep the bug population down in the garden/etc. They don't eat much beef: their diet is primarily vegetables and chicken. They buy beef for special occasions. They also hunt and eat rabbit when they are plentiful in the area. 
Furthermore, they have the property set up so that all buildings pour rainwater into containers. This way most of the water used in the garden, for the dogs, and for the chickens comes from that rainwater.

I simply do not feel that their lifestyle probably has nearly the impact as, say, an old vegetarian acquaintance of mine who ate technically vegetarian foods... that were canned/bottled/etc in large factories and made to imitate meat. *That* said, circumstantial factors can make enough of a difference that this can never be a strictly veggie-vs-meat argument anyway."

Using Pythagorean identity yields:

(3/2) integral of [(5cos^(2)(t)/9)^(1/2)](5^(1/2)/3)cos(t)dt

Taking the square root gives:

(3/2) integral of (5^(1/2)/3)cos(t)(5^(1/2)/3)cos(t)dt

Combining terms yields

(3/2) integral of (5/9)cos^(2)(t)dt

And since we like constants outside the integral:

(5/6) integral of cos^(2)(t)dt

Annick Goutal Sables is another fantastic one, treats the immortelle as the centerpiece and surrounds it with a very pleasant spicy sandalwood/amber base.  But the Byredo Oud Imortelle seems to me to really accentuate the facets of imortelle that I don't care for (I think the lemon brings the fungusy-maple aspect to the fore), and the oud is nigh undetectable to me.

Unfortunately yes it seems to be. 

&gt;The news also talks about the stock market, small businesses, mortgages and lots of other stuff that doesn't really affect young people, how are they supposed to know that taxes actually does affect them?

All of that other stuff effects them too... 

&gt;Has nothing to do with specialization of labor. 

Hiring someone to do a job is specialization and efficient in labour yes.  

&gt;When people go bankrupt it affects all of us.

Then get national health care.  Being able to do your taxes doesn't solve the core bankruptcy issue in the US of medical bills. 

&gt; We lose out when they lose their job and house and don't contribute to society, don't start businesses, and instead simply become a drain.

Bankrupt people aren't in prison. 


&gt;If you're an adult living on your own and you earn an income then you can start filing taxes. And for many people that starts at age 18. Also, many other personal finance products, like credit cards and loans, people will start getting when they turn 18. Teach people about these things in high school and it's likely they'll start using at least some of it shortly after they graduate, if not sooner.

When you have an income of essentially nothing, and no financial products you can do your taxes in a few minutes.  Adding subtracting and multiplying by a large collection of zeros is pretty easy. 

Credit cards and all that stuff, again, you know how to do the math.  

Taxes get complicated when you get into serious tax avoidance strategies, or where you have assets in multiple tax jurisdictions.  For everyone else it's pretty basic math and following instructions written at a level appropriate for a highschool grad.  "

First and foremost are basic needs like food, shelter, sex, stuff like that, followed by financial security, physical comfort, etc. Then comes love and friendship. Next need is a sense of accomplishment and success. The final, ultimate need, Maslow calls self-actualization. This can be described in layman's terms as becoming the best you that you can be. Fully discovering amd expressing your self. Only when you take care all of these needs do you feel fulfilled as a person.

And you're correct: French speaking Belgians don't know the other languages as well as Flamish people.  But the idea that Flanders will be conquered by people who don't speak Dutch to government officials, is wrong IMO.  This just makes us look bad.

sir_sri,AdviceAnimals,1389123509.0,"&gt; One day couldn't be set aside to discuss the theory and history of taxes and the benefits of understanding and doing it yourself?

Aside from the fact that the history of taxes has relatively little to do with how to do taxes, that should be covered in what I believe 'muricans call 'civics'. 

&gt; I had to memorize all the state capitals several times but I couldn't tell you more than a third of them now and it's not helping me keep my finances in order..

Right, and if the same ratio holds true you'd completely fail to manage your finances properly even if they had taught it to you any details.


&gt;spend a little time on this...

You clearly learned to read.  It's not like you are expected to do taxes alone in a locked room remembering all of your income and all of the definitions without any resources.    You were taught all of the resources you need to manage  your own finances  - you can read and you can do basic arithmetic.  Everything else is simply applying those skills. 

&gt;That's why I said teach them concepts and the theory and importance of taxes and how it functions for society, not how to calculate specific things. Still, it couldn't hurt to practice it just once or twice. Some kids are really that dumb, I was in class with them.

If they are that dumb they should hire someone.  The theory and importance of taxation isn't going to help you with financial planning.  

&gt;I guess it was more important for them to teach us which side the salad fork goes on? These are the priorities?

hylandw,DnD,1389123591.0,"There are no gods. This doesn't mean he doesn't believe in one. Base his powers on some sort of mysterious eldritch unknown power rather than divine power. He can still worship the Sun God, but in reality, the Sun God has abandoned them. Better yet, he could worship an ideal. A cleric of truth or a cleric of honour can exist, no problem.

You can also refluff your powers to make them less divine (Since, y'know, no gods) and more martial or primal. A divine radiance could actually be a vulture flying past, digging his claws in, and flying away, or maybe the blow that deals radiant damage is just a really powerful blow.

Another point relating to the last one: Ranged weapons. Refluffing a power that deals ranged radiant damage into something non-magical and non-divine is hard... unless you're using a crossbow. Maybe a melee+ranged weapon, like a crossbow with a bayonet.

Or maybe the gods have abandoned you, but you're tapping into long-forgotten godly power. This is good for paragon/epic level, since you would be a fairly important, unique character. You could be persecuted for it or worshipped for it. Or both.

When in doubt, you're the DM, and he's the player. Let him know why he can't be a cleric right off the bat, but let him know you're fine with it and want to be happy, he just either needs a reason for these powers occurring when they're long forgotten, or an alternate explanation. No matter how much work you do, it's his character, and he may veto everything you've done. It's his job to make it, your job to give restrictions and allow certain things.

Knowing dark sun, being able to tap into lost divine power could be really really really really really good for story. Maybe you want the gods to return and save the world!"

All those fleeting, explcit, hardcore, deviant, completely out of character, illegal, immoral and WRONG flashes of images that occasionally crop up when a woman bends in a nice way on the street are now to be shared. Women have no IDEA of the depravity that our imaginations throw up for us on a daily basis. Maybe these things are the result of the fucked up porn we watched when we were younger and more sexually immature. Or maybe they're innate. (Or maybe nobody gets them apart from me.)

The_Brutally_Honest,startups,1389124112.0,"Alright, so. This is my idea for this. Instead of an ""All or Nothing"" certification, we could have different levels of certification depending on what kind of information is shared.

If the site requires you to log into facebook and access all of that personal information, they'd obviously get the lowest kind of certification. If the site is like reddit where you only have to submit a username and password (not even an email if you don't want) then they'd get a much higher certification. Sites that don't require any kind of log in or anything like that, would get the highest certificaiton.

We could determine the certification upon several different factors such as facebook log in, background data gathered, what the information is used for, etc. We could even expand to eventually create our own plugin for browsers that will tell you exactly what information the site gathers and what they use the information for.

Are you understanding where I am going with this yet?

If we really wanted to (which it doesn't sound like is the case, but it's still a possibility) we could turn this into a business and run a profit by having the certification as a membership type. We could charge application fees, monthly membership costs, etc. Since we are working towards making sites more transparent, we could have the lowest certification sites have the most expensive membership and the highest certification (most transparent) the cheapest membership, or even free for them.

Of course we don't have to stop at just websites. We could expand to computer apps, phones, tablets, or whatever the next great technology invention is.

This is all just what I have thought up in about 5 minutes as I'm typing this.

PlushieChomby,AdviceAnimals,1389124121.0,"That's why I said I agree and don't. I agree it's possible to find/grow/create a lot of drugs on your own, but something like LSD is next to impossible to create yourself if you aren't an experienced organic chemist with access to a full lab and a bunch of sales restricted chemicals - the purchase of which is monitored by the DEA. Most of the acid I've encountered which people claim to have made on their own or known someone who made it is little more than watered down LSA - which is *totally* different than unadulterated LSD to anyone who's had the latter. 

I've also seen people have incredibly different reactions to MDMA and that-one-whose-name-I-can't-remember-that's-supposed-to-be-a-cross-between-MDMA-and-acid made by just-graduated-uni-chemists where it seems like the batches were somehow unequal or uneven, given all other circumstances surrounding the imbibers. Some people had an incredibly intense time, and some didn't feel anything other than severely ill and spent the whole night puking and reeling. These are experienced users, not casual, and everyone agreed something went wrong with the batches but not even the chemists knew what since according to them, they'd done everything by the book (and they were friends, not people with any reason to try to deceive us.) 

As far as I know, Chinese labs don't produce LSD, but even if you got the chemicals from one to synthesize it, without a working knowledge of organic chemistry and lots of lab experience, [the likelihood of royally fucking it up is high.](http://science.howstuffworks.com/lsd2.htm) So that's what I disagreed on, though I agree in general with the sentiment that it's possible to grow/mix/reduce your own drugs as long as doing so isn't an incredibly complex process. Hope that clarifies a bit. :) "

It says something about the way I journal, but not much about the way I live.

Relationships were more of a focal point when I was 13-15, then slightly less 16-19.

Would you rather sex with your partner end with them doing something they know will make you cum or them pushing you off with a grimace of pain?

How about a blow job or a hand job, at least with some communication about what they want? You know, for example, *exactly what every woman asks for from their partners after they finish?*



&gt;I do not think this thread is meant as tool for getting your partner off and away from you, but for tips to make sure you satisfy them when you are running out of steam. Its about having mutually caring sex, in that you won't leave them to just jerk them selves off all alone when you can offer no more.

Or, you know, just ""*wrap it up, bub! I've got sleep to catch up on!""* mutually caring sex is more about paying attention to what your partner wants before you. Not jerking it out so you can go to bed.

&gt;And berating her because she's horny after sharing her moves to make sure her partner has a good time is super uncalled for. She was talking about HAVING SEX. That ought to make her horny, if she's doing it right.

You can still go into a store and buy a device with android 2.3 that will never be updated, and next to it is a Moto X  with 4.4... and everything in between (excluding the 3.x series which ended up tablet exclusive).  

Every carrier allows different things on their network, and every  manufacturer tries to pollute - I'm sorry 'improve' android with their own  features.  Some of which are actually good, but most of which just make it hard for them to do updates to new versions of  android later.  So they don't.  

For all of the things Apple does so unbelievably wrong, they have updates  right.  The CEO says ""We're pushing out a  new update it's going to every device that's reasonably new, and it's coming within the next couple of weeks' prevents and solves sooooo many problems.  It creates some different ones too, but overall it's vastly preferable to the android experience, of buying an OS that may never get updated at all (not even security updates) unless you root your phone and install your own ROM.

Wear lightweight non-cotton undershirts. Uniqlo Airism, Under Armour, and other polyester blended shirts are good at handling sweat. Buy a bunch and wear them with everything. You won't have to replace them as often as cotton shirts either, especially if you handwash them. The dress shirts you wear should also be of a lightweight material and most pastel type colors ex. light blue linen shirt.

proclivity4passivity,relationships,1389125438.0,"Agreed. Look for the reality behind this fantasy: this girl is playing games with you. She rejected you once, and if she had truly changed her mind about you, she would have let you know that years ago instead of making a move once she found out you were engaged (shady!). Plus, there's the whole different continent thing.

On the other hand, you've got a woman who has loved you (and I assume you've loved her back) for four years and who wants to spend the rest of her life with you. That sounds pretty amazing.

That said, if this has brought up legitimate doubts about whether you want to get married and stay faithful to your fiancee, better to do your soul-searching now than after you've tied the knot.

As in the US the Ideal is 6'-6'1'', in Japan being goodly tall means being 5'10''-5'11'', being 6'1''+ isn't that much.

vanessss4,WaltDisneyWorld,1389125578.0,"I really think it's hard to go wrong with a Disney resort (aside from the All Stars, cheap but just not my cup of tea). They're all wonderfully themed and it is going to come down to how much money you'd like to spend. Given their ages and your little boys love of Cars, I'd check out the family suites at the new Art of Animation resort. The rooms are a good size (3 beds &amp; two bathrooms plus a little sink/microwave area &amp; a dining table) and the resort is really awesomely decorated. The cars section actually makes you feel like you're at Radiator Springs! There is also a building of studio rooms (2 beds, 1 bathroom, no dining section) which will be cheaper than the suites. The food court is pretty good and there is also a bar by the Nemo pool for your end of the day drink. ;)

As far as tips for the parks, don't have a go-go-go mentality. I know it will be your first trip and you'll want to see everything you possibly can, but you'll also want to *enjoy* it. Take a mid-day break, go back to the  resort for naps and/or fun in the pool, and recharge your batteries a bit, and then go back to the parks later in the day. The parks are really special after dark and there is a whole different atmosphere to them. It will be no fun to drag the kids around and tire them out all day only for them to sleep through the night parade or fireworks. 

For your princess loving daughter, check out meals at Akershus Royal Banquet Hall (Norway at Epcot) or Cinderella's Royal Table (you'll get to eat inside the castle at the Magic Kingdom!). Princesses will come around to your table while you eat. 

I've never done it but maybe look in to the dining plan. I'm sure someone else can chime in with information about that. "

The Constitution does not define the phrase natural-born citizen, and various opinions have been offered over time regarding its precise meaning. A 2011 Congressional Research Service report stated that:

The weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term ""natural born"" citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship ""by birth"" or ""at birth"", either by being born ""in"" the United States and under its jurisdiction, even those born to foreign parents; by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship ""at birth"". Such term, however, would not include a person who was not a U.S. citizen by birth or at birth, and who was thus born an ""alien"" required to go through the legal process of ""naturalization"" to become a U.S. citizen"

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1389126141.0,"Papo &amp; Yo is most interesting from an art POV, it's from a South American Indie Dev who was sort of trying to channel his experience with his abusive father into the game. It's kind of a dreamy third person puzzle game with an [insanely beautiful art style](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiHQuEUG4so) (kinda reminded me of DMC's Limbo, just in a puzzle game and brazilian setting). 

That said, last time I installed it it didn't work too perfectly, like there are often minor graphical glitches on the edges and sometimes slowdowns when you run across an area that does a save in the background. Not something that ever breaks the game but something that does remind you that you are playing an indie game. 

Reus is being discussed in the indie spotlight here. It's a pretty cute god game on a very reduced surface (but which syncs with the art style). I liked it, but I'm not sure it would be enough to justify BTA for everybody, especially since it can go on some pretty deep sales sometimes. 

Joe Danger I think had some pretty good reviews as being kinda like a more cartoony style Trials, but it's kinda more platformery with like snatching up bonus coins and stuff, I think. I mostly got it because it's kid friendly look + some form of 2 player (versus rating I think) + gamepad control and I'm always looking for games like that. 

Surgeon Simulator is kind of a joke game where you control a hand in QWOP style and try to do surgery with it even though you can barely control your hand. =&gt; led to a phase where tons of people were doing let's play videos of themselves failing. Personally, wasn't worth it for me to go BTA but it might be if that hits just your style of humor (game is pretty popular). "

I would conclude that there are absolutely reasons why vegetarian diets might not be the best route for everyone. There are reasons why just being vegetarian does not mean you're *necessarily* leaving less of a footprint. There are ways to consume meat and animal products in an environmentally responsible way. Finally, we *are* omnivorous. Though there are substitutes and ways around this factor, I believe it's expecting a lot from humanity in general to totally give up meat products. Meat is part of our natural diet. It's nutritionally and otherwise satisfying. It makes more sense to work toward environmentally sustainable consumerism, and to focus on educating people on where products come from and what responsibility we should hold for it. "

I never knew there were actual openings or anything like that. I simply wasn't exposed to it enough (or correctly). I guess I was probably rated around 700-800, at best. I knew the name of Bobby Fischer, but little else. 

By the time I was 25 or 26, I started playing against my brother-in-law. He would beat me every damn time and it was really pissing me off. After all, I was college-educated and he was borderline retarded. So, I started looking in to chess seriously, playing online, and started reading whatever books I could get my hands on. Within a year or so, we were fairly even (@ 1000 USCF). After two years, I had learned some opening theory, tactics, and strategy, and from then on, he couldn't beat me (now rated @ 1100 USCF). After about 3 or 4 years, he wouldn't play me any more and I started playing at the local chess club (@ 1200 USCF). 

At my first tournament in 2003, I beat a 1200-rated player and had a provisional rating of 1300 or so. After a year or two, I was up around 1500. Another year or two, 1600. Another year or two, I finally scratched 1700. 

Now, I am days away from turning 39. I have recently reached a peak rating of 1864, but slid back to 1842 currently. [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/Vu6ube5) of my USCF ratings-graph from about 6 months ago.

Sorry, I can't let this slide. 

As for your actual argument, there is utility in behaving at different levels of familiarity depending upon whom you are interacting.

Being on your best behavior isn't a lie. It's showing respect to someone by being the best possible version of yourself. Everyone knows that is an effort. We are not our best possible selves all the time because it is *work*. Putting forth the effort shows respect and that is appreciated. 

It is a social signal, also, that this person is not a dear friend or a family member, someone with whom you can be more informal and cozy and relaxed.

When you reach that stage of familiarity with the new person and can 'let your hair down' it's a signal that is acknowledging the change in your respective statuses with each other. "
