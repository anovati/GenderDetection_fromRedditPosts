Sahil17,Christianity,1388534463.0,"Damn I love this question. Here's what I think:

* Church Fathers and earlier heresies (i.e. Gnosticism, Marcionism, Arianism etc...). Also including arguments Church Fathers held for the true Christianity. And it'd be awesome if there was St. Nicholas laying the smack down on Arius. 

* Persecutions of Christians

* Constantine's conversion and legalization of Christianity

* Ecumenical Councils 

* Charlemagne (and some his ancestors such as Pepin the short)

* Justinian's Hagia Sophia and how he said something along the lines of ""Solomon I have surpassed you""

* Islam and Christian-Islamic Tension

* Great Schism of 1054

* Crusades

* Inquisition

* Great Western Schism (Anti-Popes and the true popes) and the Council of Constance

* The ""Renaissance popes"" that weren't known for being too great...

* Martin Luther (views on him would differ since Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants would disagree)

* King Henry VIII and the rise of the Church of England

* Council of Trent (if it was a Catholic Bible)

* Napoleon

* Nazism, Fascism, Communism and the Christian response

* Maybe some Gandhi

* Vatican Council I and II

* Catholic Church's sex-abuse scandal 

* Also some false teachers like Harold Camping

* Stuff about atheists over the years (Voltaire to the ""new"" atheists such as Hitchens, Harris, Dawkins) 

* Homosexuality and Abortion (Roe V. Wade)

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but there's probably a lot more interesting historical events. "

Pitchfork has created and sustained an echo chamber which holds that popular music (an inherently subjective product) is either ""the best thing ever"" or ""literally Hitler.""

This has led to the hilarious result above, where the Pitchfork audience doesn't quite know what to do with the biggest album of the year (""It's different! But it's in your face! But Kanye is popular! But he's married to a dumb pretty girl!"") so it ends up #1 in all three categories.

We're not talking about minimum wage jobs.  We're talking about Basic Income - i.e., a minimum income paid to everyone by the government.  I used the full-time minimum wage as a starting point.

&gt; B - Only about a third of the populace can work, I'm not sure why that is so low but apparently when you take out the old, the young and the sick that's what your stuck with. Not 250mil. More like 100mil.

This number is not correct.  The working age population (16+) is 250 million.  [Somewhat over half \(58.6%\) have a job.](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000)  That is 146.5 million.  Regardless, we're talking about a basic income, paid to everyone."

Even an inkling of that not-making-progress-in-life feeling, and bring on the water works (granted, yes I'm in school so I am making progress... but it doesn't always feel like that). 

One time, my boyfriend and I went out for pizza. We split a pitcher of beer so I was a teeeeensy bit tipsy, and terrrribly hormonal but trying not to think about it. It was obvious that I was done drinking, but I was *pretending* to pour the last sip of beer into my glass, while my boyfriend gave me that ""don't you dare"" look. Welp, I tipped the pitcher just a tiny bit too far and actually poured the beer. Immediately I went into that ""Crap! Sorry! I didn't seriously mean to do that!"" mode and tried to slide the glass over to him... accidentally tipping the glass and pouring the beverage all over the table.

I liked the Redser-Teodorczuk fight, Redmond was active off his back but i think his decision to try and pull half guard was a poor one, particularly with the choke grip so tight. 
I loved Buchinger vs Ray, Ray's strength advantage gave him the edge until the 4th round. Bad blood at the start with both men attacking right off glove touches, but it was ""Buki""'s slightly better cardio that had him come out on top. 4-0 in 2013, 3 finishes, he had a very good year."

Don't neglect the damage reduction from Resb either, that takes down another 15% if you're facing one of the more common PVE damage types.  (Disruptor/plasma/Antiproton) whereas maco is only 20% reduction to plasma.  Particularly now that we're seeing some  more content than just borg STFs  the other resistances are handy.

The sixth is just a continuity error, that's nothing to hold against a movie. Don't think there's *ever* been a movie immune to that.

Seven and Eight are pretty much true. Although with seven, he's arrogant. He was bluffing and ""knew"" he wouldn't be called. Eight, again he's cocky. Also going for reconnaissance whether than wrecking shop.

I'm pretty sure Nine has been officially addressed. Or at least there's a explanation that's mostly accepted. Thor left and couldn't get back. The other Avengers have shit to do. Sure he was talking with Bruce, but maybe he was on his own mission at the time. Another sort of suspension of disbelief. Although, yeah, someone from SHIELD would check in.

Don't fall into the trap of thinking that looking fairly young for one 300-year period means you will automatically look young for another equal period later.

You might look fairly similar for maybe a decade or so, right? Does that mean that if you add another decade onto your life, you won't show any additional signs of ageing at all?

lost2darkness,AskWomen,1388537738.0,"&gt; There are people who are controlling and abusing towards women they met in the same town as they grew up with.

I never meant to imply that I think that non-foreigners are inherently less likely to abuse or control someone. I find that attitude disturbing regardless of someone's origins. 

A direct quote from my post: "" **if** I thought that a guy I knew was engaged in this kind of relationship I would think very badly of him"" - not all of them are abusive, but there is a certain, inherent level of control that one gains by taking a wife from another country and bringing them back. I'm sure it works out fine sometimes, but the potential for abuse is much higher imho, when one is uncomfortable with the language/culture and has no friendly connections aside from the family they married into. Also ""gentleman"" is a very loose term - not all men who act like gentlemen to the public are like that in private. 

I wouldn't think a woman bringing a man back to the US in this situation is necessarily less likely to be controlling them btw. "

While the audience has some responsibility to attempt to cut through the noise, they are not beholden to the sender to patiently wade through every little bit.

bodza,electronic_cigarette,1388538271.0,"Some additional notes for people who live in Australia or New Zealand.

Due to regulation, you will not be able to buy juices containing nicotine locally. You still have options though as you are able to import nicotine for personal use.

You can:

* import unflavoured nicotine and mix it with ""doublers"" bought locally. doublers are double strength juices designed to be mixed with unflavoured nicotine. I get mine from [RTS Vapes](https://www.rtsvapes.com/) (US) or [HealthCabin](http://www.healthcabin.net/) (China)
* import pre-mixed juices from companies willing to export to Aus/NZ. I've bought juice from [Adirondack Vapor](http://www.adirondackvapor.com/), [Velvet Cloud Vapor](http://www.velvetcloudvapor.com/) and [Mount Baker Vapor](https://www.mtbakervapor.com/)

You can buy all your equipment here and there are lots of very helpful vendors. More info and community at /r/aussievapers and at the links below:

Such a designation would really be up for debate, but one groups of slaves which were treated worse than African slaves that immediately springs to mind would be Irish slaves sold to the West Indies, Virginia, and New England during the time when the African slave trade was just beginning. It is well recorded that African slaves, not tainted with the stain of the hated Catholic theology and more expensive to purchase, were often treated far better than their Irish counterparts."

Paddy Kingsland did the incidental music for the Hitchhiker's Guide as well as some of it for Doctor Who; as a result, certain scenes like the finale of *Logopolis* and indeed other episodes from around that time are accompanied by tracks that would really have worked well in a Hitchhiker's Guide episode too."

US will have boots on the ground, and there would be a lot of them. So dismantling the Syrian chemical agent stockpiles is a great way to prevent a huge war.

I'm not sure what point you are trying to make with your second paragraph. You kind of diverge halfway through.

If OP chooses instead to confront their significant other with this opinion, with breaking up as an option as an outcome of the conversation, rather than breaking up outright, then even if they do break up, the other person will come out of it with insight into what went wrong, and can improve.

On a side note, I was in my B&amp;M on a Friday night recently and it was absolutely dead and I was shocked by it and as I talked to the person behind the counter I came to the realization that the reason was that cigars are a treat and a nice thing for me whereas their regulars are just that, regulars, so the store is packed during the days/early night times but people would rather do other things at night.

In my opinion, dogs are happiest so long as they're on a schedule and they get time with you. All of my dogs have pretty much been apartment dogs since they were pups, and none of them have been small or particularly low energy dogs.

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1388540742.0,"I do know of people who like the ELF Studio brushes, but out of the drugstore ones I've tried Real Techniques is my favorite. Here's a breakdown of what I think are some of the best/worst things about ELF, RT, and EcoTools:  

* **ELF:** Has a nice 11-piece set for $30 and ELF frequently runs 50% off sales on their website so you can pick it up for $15 + $5 shipping. I would recommend this brand if you're fairly new and are not planning on focusing on any area of makeup in particular (i.e. not sure if you like eye makeup or face makeup more). They also have a 20-ish piece set that goes for about $75, and if you scoop it up during one of the frequent 50% off sales then it comes out to between $1 and $2 for each brush ($36-ish + no shipping b/c ELF gives free shipping with a purchase over $35) which includes the ones that comes in the 11-piece set as well as extras such as a kabuki brush or stippling brush.  
* **Real Techniques:** Their face brushes are usually about $8-10/piece on Amazon and their eye set includes 5 brushes and goes for ~$15 on Amazon (price fluctuates regularly, but that's about the average I think). That means their face brushes should be about 5x and their eye brushes 2-3x better than the ELF brushes. In my experience I haven't found the quality discrepancy that great and I wouldn't recommend getting the entire RT line (~$160 last time I checked, but they've since added brushes) as a starter set. I think they are better quality than the ELF brushes (I've had an experience with an ELF studio brush that leaked dye), but I would buy these more so if you have a bit of extra money to spare and know what brushes you are most likely to use.  
* **EcoTools:** Their eye set goes for about $6-8 and includes 5 brushes, and their face brushes can be $5-8 (again prices off Amazon which fluctuate a lot and differ from store prices--usually lower on Amazon--but I pretty much order everything online). They also have a face set with 4 kabuki brushes that goes for $9-11. In this case I think their eye set is comparable in price to the ELF one, and in my experience they have been softer. However the handles of the EcoTools ones are significantly shorter than those of RT and ELF so if you prefer a longer handle you might stay away. They're fantastic for travel though and come with a little travel-friendly bag. The bristles are shaped a big larger so if you don't have a lot of lid space I would avoid this. I do think their kabuki face brushes are great bang for the buck (if you like kabukis, some people prefer handles) and their individual face brushes are good if they suit your taste (on the large side, quite fluffy, synthetic hairs). 

Basically, if you don't have major preferences to how you want your brushes to be (handle size, bristle shape, etc.) go with ELF during the 50% off sale. If you do have some preferences, and if they aren't met with the ELF ones, then RT and EcoTools would be good bets. Additionally, in my experience, drugstore brushes aren't great for precision (i.e. if you like your brushes on the smaller side because you want precise placement you might have to go up a range). "

*The End of Time* focused on the High Council, under Rassilon's leadership. It was he who was in charge of the Final Sanction, and you would've seen what he did to the Time Lady who dared to suggest they allow themselves to die. Rassilon was tyrannical; he disintegrated her. Sure, the council voted unanimously minus two, but how much of that was due to the abject hopelessness of the war and the intimidation of Rassilon?

When the Master attacked Rassilon at the end and Gallifrey returned to the war, he would have been out of commission for a while, which means the Time Lords would not enact the sanction. Following this, Gallifrey was also put into a pocket universe, safely away from the Daleks who destroy themselves in the crossfire. Now they're out of the war, they don't need to enact the sanction at all. It was the war that made them what they became, and now the war is out of the equation, they shouldn't be too great a threat."

Sometimes people do use filters when posting here. It's discouraged, but it does happen. [Here](http://redd.it/1ouut9) is a comparison done by another user to showcase the effect. 

Otherwise, as /u/VenusDemise mentioned, using a beauty blender is a popular method of achieving a flawless finish. Recently there has been some talk about the Hourglass Ambient Lighting powders doing this too but those are high-end. I do think there are some mid-end versions of light-diffusing powders (Ben Nye's Banana Powder comes to mind) and WNW bronzer in Reserve your Cabana is said to be a dupe for one of the Hourglass powders.

All of this I did until I could start developing my own personal reactions and 'personality,' and then I practised enough that it became nearly automatic.

Sure, I come of a bit weird unless I focus completely on being 'normal' (gives me headaches), and sure I'm still not great at everything (shopkeepers are hard) but I'm getting better, and even had my first girlfriend in April, although she cheated with my best friend so maybe it's negligible.

**Most Played:** Skyrim LE. I got it a couple of weeks ago and already have 80+ hours in it. There's so much to do still!

**Favorite Store:** GOG has been particularly awesome this year.

**Best Support**: Amazon! I bought Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons from them on Christmas day for around $6 with a gift card I had. A couple of days later, they price matched with Steam, bringing the price down to $4. I contacted Amazon support and they gave me a $2 gift card to match the difference in less than a day. 

**Worst Support:** Game UK. Nothing too terrible, it just took them a long time to respond and they weren't helpful.

**Backlog:** Probably 20+ games now, yikes.

**Thoughts on Bundles:** I love/hate them so much. I feel like I'm an extreme couponer only with game bundles. I have so many games in my Steam library that I haven't even heard of and I always wonder ""where the hell did this come from"", since I'll buy huge bundles for one or two of the included games.

1. Once placed, can only be destroyed. 
2. You Incur cost for every new hole you want to drill.
3. Drill can be added and removed from the stand.

* The ability to skin all the cool 

* The ability to permit particular vehicles/mounts to enter certain roads

* Trees! I would have loved it if there were high-trees

* Icons to indicate whether a toy's skin can be changed or if logic can be applied to it. There are lots of objects which can be given special logic or change skin, but you wouldn't know until you actually used the wand on it!

* The ability to rotate objects upside down! it would be really cool!

* More controls in the Creativi-Toys

* More tutorials. I don't think a lot of this is terribly intuitive.

* Can I skin those dynamic toys, like the wall jump, etc.?

* Can I use water?

* Can I have more resources that I see in Toy Sets? I don't think we got everything the developers had available. I can see several housing units in the Pirates of the Caribbean play set that we don't have in our Toy Box housing sets.

Sharkictus,TrueChristian,1388545232.0,"You should sticky this. 

One of em is to not enjoy being a dick anymore. 

Another is stop swearing, with the exception of a one pun.

Another is to not giggle at everything that can be or is in another context a sexual euphemism.

Another is to keep not looking at porn, and try my best to not supplement my sinful lust with other things.

Another is to workout more consistently, my body is a temple of the Lord, it should be cared for.

Another is actually giving a bit more care into my appearance, but not to a vanity level. If it wasn't for my parents stopping, i'd go outside in the cold snowing weather wearing shorts, a partially buttoned dress shirt, and a clip on bowtie, with a hoodie around because it's comfy and the cold does not bother me. But it stupid looking, and it dishonors my parents, and looking for foolish for no reason other than personal comfort is just as sinful as wearing something to impress everybody at the expense of comfort. There is an argument to be found that i am vain in purposely looking stupid. 

I must not be so spiteful when be nagged.

I must not have such high degree of hatred for myself.

I must really stop desiring to be bit more like in-control comic/cartoon/show supervillains/antagonists/jerk protagonists. 

Last is to rededicate my life to Christ. I was born and raised a Christian, always had intellectual interest within it. I went toa private non-denominational Christian high school. I can't actually say when I became a Christian, it's lot fuzzier when you were born and raised in it sort of gradually accepted it, especially when you hold to theology that's arguably higher than 'meat' level theology, at least for this time and age. I'd have to say the first time I tried to dedicate myself was in 9-11-2010, after getting 20 on the ACT the third time in a row, but each time being extremely different ways. 

I didn't change for a long time. I was self-aware, but I didn't feel guilt. I was always irritated that the Holy Spirit didn't sanctify me. 

In the Summer of 2012, I just gave up. I still intellecually held that all the truth of Christians were true, but just that I wasn't saved, and there was no point of myself getting saved, and that God just didn't care about me. 

I never stated my un-gave up. But it started in Fall of 2012, when i discovered /r/TrueChristian. 

Nothing bothered me more was Christians so close to being right, being so utterly wrong in actions. I took it upon myself to make sure that peopel were correctly theologically informed, and to make sure they did de-glorify God in their pride and dickishness.

This sub under that leadership never actually disliked me, because I was still conservative in my theology, in some ways, more so than them. However the mocking sub, /r/truestchristian rather liked me as well because I'd stand up when people here were being wrong. They always thought i was at risk of being banned, but never was. I was doing good for God.

Lou actually did get better IMO, though I'm sure my role was minimal to none, and the sub got substantially better when he left 2013 for his resolution. 

Now over this year, I got so much better. I want to glorify God more, I'm more self-aware of when i'm being a dick/supervillain-esque, and I'm feeling guilt for it once in my life, instead of just seeing it as just objectively wrong but whatever. 

When I first with my words dedicated myself in 'official' way to Christ, I was at low point.

Now I am at middle point. Not the greatest, but not terrible eithier. I think this is good time to rededicate myself to Him, so my pride in eventual success will not replace my faith. 

The next year, I no longer care that I have no girlfriend, that I may or may not get one. I do not mind that my friends are farther from me and hard to communicate with. I do not mind my aloness in my family due to generational/cultural gaps with my parents, my cultural gap with society at large, my elder brother being autistic and mentally retarded making me feel the some of the worst parts parts of being an only child and having siblings. 

I only care that I glorify God, that I do my best in all my works so that glorifies Him, that He is the true Companion to have in life, that my future is up to Him mostly in the metaphysical sense predestination existing and deciding outside of time sense, and me in terms of cause and effect time. That whether or not my ideal of having wife and children is fufilled or not, I will glorify him in some way. 

God is enough. I hope I live my life from this on living it out that way, and if and when I fall, his Holy spirit lifts me up and improves me so I fall away less. "

They kicked me out and never told me why, but I know it's because I had a history of depression and didn't fit in. Kicking me out was their only way to protect the other students—the rich kids who jacked off in my face and stole my stuff. It's not like I learned anything there, anyway.

postExistence,AskReddit,1388546444.0,"Well, we're currently on the verge of overpopulating the first planet you put us on, so we want to travel into space and colonize a couple nearby celestial objects (our satellite, this big red planet called Mars...), but we're having a lot of problems I think you can help us with.

First, oxygen is necessary for our respiratory systems, but we can't find it in space. Is it okay if you could solve this somehow?

Next, the moment we enter space we are bombarded with radiation from the sun. Normally, we are shielded from this radiation with the Ozone layer, but we have to wear a hell of a lot of stuff to protect ourselves from that stuff in space. Is it possible for you to make our bodies resistant to all forms of radiation? Just in case other stars give off different kinds of radiation we haven't discovered yet.

Next, the human body can't handle the severe pressure changes when exposed to empty space. Is it possible for you to allow the holes of our... nostrils, ears, eyes, sphincters, penises, and vaginas to close up like our mouths can? That way we might be able to resist the pressure change (I'm not absolutely sure...).

Next, we have an issue involving zero gravity. It seems that our muscles and bones deteriorate in it. I guess that's because our muscles and bones develop through resistance against different objects (I mean, exercise, right?) How would you be able to fix that?

Those are the things I'm really concerned about, but I don't know if I'm the right person to request this, because honestly I'm not sure how specific the requests should be. I just know these are problems that need to be fixed.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388546803.0,"Also, it's no where near adequate. 

Lets just look at one country for a moment. 

Ethiopia.  Per capita GDP  (nominal not PPP) - 513 dollars a year, total GDP ~50 billion USD a year.  Population 91 million.   (on purchasing parity they are at 100 billion USD a year). 

As compared to say, Germany, population, about 82 million, per capita GDP 43000 per year, total GDP about 3500 billion.  

So... to get Ethiopia to to level of germany needs 3450 billion dollars a year.  That would be the entire US federal  government budget roughly (~3800 billion).   The US, combined public and private only gives about 70 billion dollars in air total per year, and a lot of that is military aid, europe combined is about on par.  So even if the US and europe teamed up to just fund Ethiopia, and ignored everyone else, ethiopia would still be somewhere around 1/20th the wealth of the US per capita.  

Now obviously the expectation is that a country would  produce most of that value on its own.  Aid is to cope with  disasters and to  help fund the development of infrastructure etc. 

But it is a VERY very very very very long  way to go from where  many of these countries were in the 1950's or 1960's to somewhere reasonably well off.  India had a literacy rate of 11% in  1947, it's 74% today.  Most of europe and the US have had  literacy rates of &gt;90% for a century (in some cases 2 centuries).  They were looted and repressed by empires, torn apart by strife for decades in many cases, and 

Since 1970 china has been growing at a breakneck pace - this is because they took aid money they were given (in part by the US) invested it well, made serious legal reforms to make  the country attractive to foreign investment.  That's  really the only reasonable model.  But it takes decades for good policy to take hold, and if you cannot keep the political situation under control, say with  coups, religious strife, or just a constant parade of new plans then you never get anywhere.  

I know it's an odd analogy but it's a bit like NASA.  If every major  project you have takes  10 years to complete, but every 8 years someone new takes over and throws out whatever you were working on  then you end up seeming like you've accomplished relatively little because almost nothing ever  gets finished.  

You can't build schools if you have no teachers, you cannot get teachers if you have no roads and money, you cannot get roads unless you have people who would use them and vehicles to drive on them, you cannot get money to buy vehicles unless you have something to trade, and you cannot have something to trade unless you have something people  want to buy, and you can't make anything people want to buy if you have an illiterate population just trying to scrape by.  Either you need to get  lucky and find something in the ground that is tremendously valuable, and then not squander the wealth, or you need massive investment for the sake of it, and that needs to go on for years.

I have to disagree in that things can be dissimilar from themselves, it creates a paradox yes, but paradoxes are a necessary part of existence that we have to live with. You were poking holes in my analogies by taking them to a further point than the example, something that can be done with any analogy, as they are models, and not exact replications. I would invite you to poke holes in my original statement, perhaps come with a counter example, but please, refrain from taking pot shots at my examples, when they are not the basis of my argument. And just to restate it in another way, take this: a rose is a rose, is a rose. Every one of them are unique, yet you can recognize a rose without having seen it before. God is the son, is the holy spirit. They are all three one, but they are different versions of themselves. Each with a different consciousness, yet all three the same. I'm not a theologian, my abilities to properly convey my understanding of what I believe to be the creator and king of the universe are limited, considering the fact that I don't even really know how a digital camera works. Yet from my experience, and from what I do know, things can exist separate from themselves simultaneously and still be the same, just look at quantum physics.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388547353.0,"&gt;Intel and AMD processors have different ISAs or Instruction Set Architectures.

You're thinking Intel and ARM.

AMD is the sole  licensee of the x86 ISA (at least that anyone has heard of, via and transmeta have also made X86 cpu's but they're very very limited markets), and the AMD64/IA64 instructions were added by AMD (and then adopted by intel).

That's why Intel and AMD CPU's are compatible without  a recompilation or interpreter, they have the same ISA, although there's a constant battle to add the odd new thing in that the other guy doesn't have. 


&gt; Intel ISAs preforming a task approximately 20% faster as Intel's cores can handle instructions better. 

While that's not the iSA persay, that's the gist of it.  Intel cpu's clock for clock are much more efficient - this is called the microarchitecture, and it's the implementation of the ISA.  A few years ago AMD briefly almost caught up to Intel, but Intel  has much better fabrication processes than anyone else in the business, so even running identical microarchitectures Intel can use less power for the same thing. 


&gt;they are more efficient

efficient is an odd metric.  Definitely intel processors are more efficient in terms  of performance per watt for synthetic loads.  But in terms of performance per dollar AMD processors are sometimes better deals (especially when you consider system cost), it depends on a huge plethora of factors.

Not-Buddy Holly, armed with a Guitar and Katana, braves the wasteland and fights off rival bands, mutant monsters, and robots in his quest to become King. Deliciously campy.

wizardlegs,Fighters,1388548241.0,"Conceptual things like footsies and spacing carry over. Execution is a really  big thing though. Most people just pick up a fighting game and mash like crazy, you never get better doing that. If you've taken time to practice execution, and practice hitting the buttons you want to hit, instead of just going ham on them, that will translate pretty well from game to game. Just generally being in control of what you are doing, even if you don't have great fundamentals yet. If you're pretty decent at SC2 and can get your character to do exactly what you want it to do, you should be able to pick up characters in other games. And it only gets easier the more you do it.

There is still going to be some level of transition to any new game though. Different games/characters react to buttons in different ways, or have different paces and such, different execution techniques and so on. But still, if you're not mashing, you're already on your way to being in control of what you're doing. That can go pretty far in picking up new games

Each game is going to have its own set of rules though. Just little things, little bits of game engine or character knowledge. Nothing really speeds that up except getting experienced with a particular game, and developing habits for various games. Easy example is jumping in Marvel and being able to block, then going to Street Fighter and getting blown up for jumping. It's just a 'rule' you have to learn, among many others across different games. Alternatively though, if you can hit a lot of the best combos in Marvel with general ease, you can probably pick up Persona 4 combos fairly quickly.

At least that's how I've experienced fighting games over the years"

Privacy is important because you have to be wary of what information, even seemingly innocuous information could do in the wrong hands.  

Imagine you engage in completely legal activity - you shower naked.  Do you really want someone to be allowed to take pictures of you in the shower and then pass them around?  

Where reasonable expectations of privacy end and public disclosure start is not always clear, and  that's why there is a debate.  It's not that walking around your house versus being in the shower naked are necessarily any different in terms of what should be  considered private, but technology has changed so  we need a constant debate about what you can do now.

kickingturkies,pics,1388549760.0,"Well, my wording may have been wrong. See, I'm not against being on the same flight as a well behaved dog - but it's very hard to tell if a dog is well behaved and will be well behaved on a plane.

Service dogs provide a specific use for the person, and are going to be okay on a place. They have gone through training and need to be able to, after all. 

A normal dog though? Even if they're normally well behaved they might not respond well on planes. Therefore, they should not be allowed on and it is irresponsible of the owner to bring them on because they do not know that their dog will behave itself on the flight.

Edit: Short version is that we know with almost absolute certainty that service dogs will be fine on a plane, but untrained dogs do have a larger chance of not behaving itself and hurting somebody by accident or on purpose (even if they are normally fine)."

My favorite part/thing is how even though the rest of the characters tend to sort of not want/like him around, he is still absolutely essential to solving a lot of their cases. His character's backstory and all hit a little close to home for me, too, including the piano playing thing. My favorite line/scene of his has to be from that one part in Season 5 (I thin k it was?) with the Amish episode, and he solves that rock piano collection *immediately*, when no one else understood and underestimated him, and Hodgins asks him what he's doing when he starts tapping on the rocks, he replies with he's playing *""My Heart Will Go On,""* and Hodgins scoffs in disgust that he ""hates that song."" 
&gt;*""Not the way I play it.""*

It was because we learned that she was sleeping with a lot of men to get pregnant so she could get out of the military with an honorable discharge. There are some people who say ""oh shit, I don't want to be here"" after they joined the military. This is the female equivalent of shooting your foot but with a kid.

OswegoWriter,WritingPrompts,1388552183.0,"Although it's my son's wedding day, I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I'm more pleased that I still fit into my uniform twenty-five years on then that he and Barbara are to be wed. Now, I've nothing against Barbara, of course; she's a lovely girl and will make a fine wife for Ian. No, it's simply that I'd been putting on a bit of weight in the past few years, and hve re-adopted my old Army fitness routine to put myself back into shape. I dare say, even as grey as I've gotten, I still look quite the trim soldier. Victoria fussed over my wearing the uniform to a formal wedding, as any wife would do, of course, but Ian has just graduated top of his class at Sandhurst, and I can't help but to show them where such a fine officer got his mettle.

Victoria has been a worrier since the day I met her. She was a Red Cross nurse in Belgium, and like hundreds of other fighting men, I'd fallen madly in love with her after being evacuated from Dunkirk. It was a minor wound, really; a clean break of my left radius that healed perfectly. I'd been in the rearguard as the troops were being evacuated, and suddenly i found myself alone. In all the pandemonium, I'd become separated from my squadron. I hid out in a motor garage on the edge of town, hoping to be found. Our orders were to move toward the beachhead at dark, and as the sun was setting, I turned and made my way. Unluckily, I encountered a young German soldier just then, but in his hesitation, I managed to disarm him of his rifle. He did manage to grab a tire iron and smash me once, hence the broken arm. But I tripped him up and made a mad dash for the beach. Since I was wounded, I was given one of the last spots on the flotilla. And that's how I met Victoria.

Of course, she naturally fell in love with me as well as I recuperated in Southampton. We wed only days before I landed on Gold Beach in Normandy, and by the time I'd rotated out after Nijmegen, we began work on a family. First was Charlie, himself an RAF flight instructor, then Susan, who had to work twice as hard as any man to be taken seriously as a Barrister (dedicated like her father, I dare say). And then came Ian. He was a difficult birth, so he was our last. Further, he never wanted to be a military man like his father. He tried everything else: automotive engines, music, writing, even television acting for a spot. But it was in his blood, I suppose.

But as I said, Victoria was a worrier. When Ian announced the engagement, I was naturally thrilled for the boy, first of the children to marry off and all that. But I suspexted that they-- Ian and Victoria, that is-- they were hiding something from me. I could tell there was something they were dancing around when I asked about Barbara. Victoria had met her earlier in the day, and I couldn't get a straight answer from her when it came to Barbara's family. She was living in London, as you well know, but when I asked about her family, or where she'd lived prior... well, for whatever reason, they didn't think that I could handle her being German. Or that you'd fought, for that matter. But I assured them that the war was behind me. I dare say, I found her to be a lovely girl when I finally met her, and now we've finally met as well.

A drink to our health, then? To old soldiers and to new families.

~ ~ ~

To old soldiers and to new families.

As you see, I am not wearing my uniform. I burnt it the day I was released from the prisoner camp. I came to hate the sight of it after a while, as most Germans did, but rules were rules, and the Geneva Convention required I wear it as a prisoner. How I wished that it would disintegrate in the wash, or would tear apart at the seams! But whenever it did split or tear, the nice American ladies would repair it in a week or two. I suspect that they replaced it at one point. Americans poke fun at us for being 'sticklers' for rules, as they say, but they can be just as bad, I have found.

After the war, I was without a job for a long time. I found occasional work helping to rebuild, but I only found permanent work in 1949. As it happened, my father was a minor administrator during the Weimar years, working in the Embassy in Poland. Since we lived near the borders with the new nation, my father spoke enough of it, and I learned much of it living in Warsaw. 

We left for Stuttgart after the Nazis were elected, hoping to get to France or Switzerland, somehow. I was a natural linguist, so I learned some French, and when I was inevitably drafted in 1938, I joined a unit which listened in on French military transmissions. When we invaded France, I was personally selected by Erwin Rommel himself to be in his headquarters unit. Back then, such a selection was a great honour; doubly so when it was Rommel.

You say you were at Dunkirk? I was there as well. But I didn't see any action. No, I arrived a few days too late for that. I was there mostly to translate whatever documents hadn't been burned. I was at Normandy as well, when the invasion came. I do not know which beach was which, but believe it or not, Hitler suspected that the invasion might come at Normandy, not Calais. He had a translation unit there to monitor secret transmissions, but he eventually changed his mind about Calais. A lot of American trickery, if I recall correctly! But that was where I was eventually captured. By then, I was tired of being a soldier, and what I was fighting for. Many of us felt the same way, so we surrendered without a fight.

Anyway, in 1949, I found a job with the Americans translating Polish broadcasts. They were worried about Soviets still stationed there, and I was one of the rare Germans who spoke the language but wasn't a party member. It was there that I met Olive, a girl from Iowa who was a stenographer. We married, and I was eventually given permission to enter the United States. I've lived in a small city named Des Moines since 1955, and just became a citizen six years ago. I have one son, Byron, and one daughter, Barbara. I once forbade Byron to join the Army, and so far he has obeyed me. He is a manager at a bank in Chicago now, so I doubt he will ever put on a uniform. 

You look surprised. Did you expect me to be the one who'd smashed your arm? Or some young German you'd shot at in France or Holland? No, I was neither of those. Fate hasn't brought us here to reminisce on old battles and long-past wars, you know. No, it is simply a day to celebrate having survived, I think. And that in surviving, we have made something greater than ourselves.

Neebat,AskReddit,1388552412.0,"You've made a good case why, economically, minimum wage jobs exist, while completely omitting the morality of paying people less than the minimum to survive.  A lot of people will attack the premise from a morality point of view, so it's important to shore up that side of the case.

The fact is, many employees end up costing the company more than it benefits the company.  In my line of work (software development,) it takes anywhere from 3 to 18 months before an employer breaks even on a new hire.  Even a college educated developer needs time to learn skills specific to the employer and a minimum-wage worker is no different.  So that first week at McDonalds?  They're worse off having hired you than if they had not.  The second, third, fourth week, well that depends...

Eventually, a fraction of the employees that Walmart hires will fail a drug test, be caught stealing or abusing customers.  Those people cost the company a lot.  The ones who make it through the first year are worth a hell of a lot more than minimum wage.  The funny thing is, most of them are making more than minimum wage at that point, either because they've been promoted, or because they took the experience and proven work-ethic from their crappy McJob and moved on to a bit better job.

Today's career path is often not a ladder at all.  It's a road, and you drive down it to a better job.  Once you've done that, the minimum wage crappy job that you left behind is still there for someone who is either just starting off in life, or has fucked up and had to start over.  Employment gaps can be caused by a ton of things, but they're poison on your resume.  Whether it's because you quit to be a full-time parent, or because you took an involuntary leave of absence hosted by the state, you're going to come back to find a lot of employers just won't want to your kind around.  The minimum wage jobs will always give you a chance.

Then of course, if you're any good, you'll blast out of there into a real job.

It's morally reprehensible to expect someone to live year after year on a minimum wage below the poverty level.  But no one is asking that an honest worker do that."

Although a first quarter turnover doesn't seem significant, it can lead to a sway in momentum or encourage the team to go on a scoring streak, there's just too much going on in a basketball game compared to soccer, where you can slowly pass the ball around the defence without any pressure. And the reason why I'm not ""applying that end of close game restriction to your scenarios in soccer"" is because the last few minutes of a game in soccer hardly matters. Sure, you might see the occasional wonder goal equalizer/game-winner, but 90% of the time, nothing happens, simply because it's much harder to score and things like turning the ball over don't impact the game that much compared to basketball."

For one thing, we constantly bicker about the stupidest of shit. 

Now, before I go any further, I have no problems with any of the religions of the world. They're all good. However, there's one sect of every religion that I hate with a passion: the fucking extremists. 

Blowing thenselves up, persecuting others, the whole shebang. If they were an alchohal, they'd all be lumped together in an asshole cocktail. And you know who mixes that cocktail? More Goddam extremists. Muslim, Christian, hell, even atheist extremists convey their beliefs to their offspring and anyone else who comes near, and never in a polite, respectful way. It's always in force. In a 'I'm better than you kind of way.' 

Well, listen up you assholes. You're all, wait for it, the Goddam same. Every single one of you extremist fucktards and your beliefs (no matter the rituals and actual beliefs) are the same. No-one's religion or opinion is better than the next person's. That's why they're called beliefs, not facts. 

Now, as for the second part of 'you argue of the most ridiculous shit to cross this side of Jupiter'. You glorify literally fucking idiots. 

Your schoolteachers, the leaders of the war on stupid, aren't even issued proper weapons or compensation to fight said war. Meanwhile, some asshat in Hollywood get's paid a metric fuckload of money to do absolutely nothing productive. Just sit their and fuck their glorified, pompous husband, or in your most favorite pop-stars case, a random singer who looks like fucking Beetlejuice. Or, over in New Jersey, they do the exact same things on the shoreline. Wait, you actually managed to collectively pull your brains together and cancel that cancerous shit. Bravo, humanity. You've managed not to fuck that up. 

Secondly, your system of governing is so stupidly fucked up and beurocratic that I can't even comprehend how you got this far. You'd think that 541 or so people can manage not to fuck up an entire nations government, but that was before I learned of my first point. You also managed to make the most perfect, utopian governmental system I can think of: pure socialism, and, to a more extreme sense, communism. You managed to make a system where everyone is equal, no-one is put above anyone else, and still, greed marched it's ass on in. 

Finally, as my third point in my 10-minute long ramble, slavery is your best bet, just so long as you do not enslave a thing with a conscience. Aka: make and improve a fuckload of robots. Once you have a base of mindless slaves to run the place, then all of you can sit back and relax. That's what the conquistadors and plantation owners were doing, just on a smaller, more morrally corrupt scale: creating (what they thought) was a mindless group of workers to carry out their biddings while they reclined on the top of the food chain.

You know, this was probably (for the most part) directed at the good 'ole contry of 'Murica, land of the free and home of the fatasses, so I appologize to anyone outside of America for everything past my first point. I don't know enough to judge your problems, so I won't criticise you. 

So, to summarize, fuck all ya'll. Now, enjoy some Nickelback while I put on earmuffs.

I would feel like a Greek goddess and absolutely 100% ready to take on the New Year! :)

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388555800.0,"&gt;f we were to get universal healthcare how much would it affect the cost of living in the U.S.?

It would cut it  by about 6%  of GDP.  The US spends 18% of GDP on healthcare for worse health outcomes than anyone else, and the second highest spenders are France and Switzerland who are around 12%.  The UK's NHS spends about 10% of GDP (The low end of the scale) and  still has better care than the US. 

&gt; I feel like having a more socialized gov't you get more security but like in america you have more potential and opportunity to make a lot of money.

There are super rich people in other countries too.  In the US you have the advantage of being in a highly populous rich country with one language.  

As hard as europe tries, it is not really one market yet.  You can't just make a product and sell it in english, you have to incur overhead for everyone else. 

But the 3rd richest guy in the world is Spanish, the 9th and 10th are French, the 12th is swedish etc.  

Certainly there are parts of europe that are quite a bit poorer than the US - that's not because they're socialist, it's because they've had bad policies, corrupt rules or particularly bad governments, including very recently.

Since cellular towers are basically local things they're trying to limit peak capacity on towers (and maybe the back end) by driving up the price.  Oh, and because they can.  If you'll pay it they're happy to take your money.  Without any easy way to have wide open competition in the mobile network market (because spectrum is a finite resource, useful spectrum moreso, and useful spectrum that isn't already in use even more rare than those) there's no way for a new entrant to the market that is willing to accept lower profit margins.

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1388557621.0,"From what I understand (not an expert), it does matter to some extent. It's the same thing about why you'd use different bristles with different products because natural hair bristles are porous and would be best with powder products rather than cream or liquid. On the other hand, synthetic bristles aren't porous and are better with cream/liquid products. If you do follow that, then I would think you'd want to use some sort of oil-based soap or maybe a DIY method with olive oil + dish soap with the synthetic brushes. 

I think that an olive oil based soap (castile, Dr. Bronner's, Master's Brush cleaner, Savon de Marseille, etc.) can also be used for natural hair brushes but I'd be hesitant about using a DIY method on natural hair brushes because they are porous and they might soak up a bit more of the oil than I'd like or the detergent used might be too harsh. I also wouldn't use rubbing alcohol (as a spray) on my natural hair brushes because I'd be afraid of drying them out and causing breakage, but I don't mind with synthetics. 

There is also [this](http://sweetmakeuptemptations.com/2013/11/09/brush-cleaning-and-caring/) post from one of my favorite blogs on how to care for brushes that you might like. :) "

I'd especially recommend them if you're into duochrome/color-changing. 

I also recently tried DreamWorld Hermetica's semi-loose formula from their new collection [here](http://dreamworldminerals.net/eyesmedieval.html). This does include a binder so it's soft, but not quite as fluffy. It's much denser and creamier, but I think because of the formula the finishes are somewhat limited to the more metallic side (i.e. if you're into matte this isn't for you).

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1388559097.0,"There's a book called Perdido Street Station, and in that book they talk about crisis energy, a form of magic created by potential and paradox. The author gets pretty philosophical about it, and it's a good read.

In terms of measuring energy, don't get too sciencey. A great cyclist can create something like 100 Watts for a couple hours, a fit person can make about 200W for a brief time period, with great stress on their body. You can do much more if your body is in a flight of fear. That's not a lot compared to modern electrical needs, and combusting oxygen for a fireball would take a great deal more.

Better to start by saying, ""what can my run of the mill mage do?"" And then, ""What can the best mage in a generation do?"" Think about what it means to have a few hundred ordinary mages, and the impact of extraordinary ones. Tone the magic down or up until your world looks the way you want it to."

You can spot clean them after every use if you like, or you can be lazy like me and sort of just brush them on the back of your hand until nothing more comes out and call it a day.

LeeTaeRyeo,gaybros,1388562455.0,"The survey is actually longer than it appears. There are several points where it branches. For instance, on the relationship question, if you respond anything other than single, it will ask about your relationship information (it skips these questions if you respond single). All told, it took multiple hours to write it up (most of which was spent on entering the countries for the location question).

My reasoning for having such a long survey was that many people responded on a recent survey that they were interested in detailed demographics. So, I designed the survey to attempt to gather as much demographic information that I could. Later on, I will be performing statistical analysis of the data to get more accurate pictures of the subreddit's population."
Jess_than_three,ainbow,1388562482.0,"No, Vexillae, it isn't illegal. What's illegal is for them to get caught paying the female cashier less *because she's female*. But then the onus is on her, unfortunately, to be able to demonstrate in court that she *should* be making the same amount or more on the basis of reviews, performance, length of employment, etc. 

To make matters worse, especially in shitty entry-level jobs like retail and food, employees are strongly discouraged from discussing their rate of pay (and it may even be against policy to do so) - which prevents a person from knowing they're getting screwed. 

For example, I once worked at a restaurant and complained to a coworker, who had been there longer than I had (say three years to my two) that a brand-new employee, who was sixteen and had zero previous job experience, had been hired at $8.50 an hour while I was still only making $8. His response was along the lines of ""Wait, you're making *how* much?"": he was getting something like $7.75.

And even worse than that is the fact that sexism in the workplace isn't even necessarily *conscious*. If two employees are doing the same general quality of work *but there isn't a standardized metric to judge that by*, one may get worse reviews and less compensation and opportunity for advancement for reasons that have nothing to do with the job. To give another example from my own life, I've had more than one coworker (and at least one manager) who legitimately believed that all the female employees at the given workplace were less competent - despite evidence to the contrary. So if one of those guys is doing the reviews, who's going to get the bigger raise, right? 

At which point it becomes even *tougher* to prove, because now you need to show that *all* the women in a given position make less than *all* the men, controlling for other factors - which is going to be a difficult case to make if there are only a total of five or ten people in your specific position, all with varying degrees of experience, training, skill, etc. 

So yeah, there are laws that say that you can't do that, but in practice that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. "

Barge108,subaru,1388564572.0,"I do bodywork for a living, here's how I remove stickers/decals:

I use a pinstripe remover first-- lots of tool manufacturers make them including Snap-on, Matco, Dynabrade, etc, but off-brands make ones that work nearly as well for a fraction of the price.  You can also buy pinstripe remover wheels that fits in a standard drill, which works half-way decent if an air compressor isn't available to you.
You use these tools to remove the majority of the decal, but some adhesive is usually still left.  I clean up what's left with an adhesive cleaner such as ""3M General Purpose Adhesive Cleaner"", which you can get at most auto and paint supply stores.  It is safe to use on most painted surfaces, but if you let it soak for too long it will begin to soften up the paint and eventually lift it.  You'll know when this starts to happen because the clear coat will begin to look weather checked and hazy.  But that takes considerably longer to happen than it should take you to remove some decal adhesive.

With both the stripe tool and the adhesive cleaner, you need to be extra careful with plastic parts.  I'm not entirely sure why, but it's way easier to burn through the paint with a stripe tool wheel on a plastic part than on a metal body panel.  Plastic is also slightly porous and will absorb some adhesive cleaner which can cause paint to lift.  Again, only something you have to worry about if you let it soak for a long period of time.

As for the rocker molding, I do not believe Subaru sells parts pre-painted.  But I don't do any ordering of parts so I guess you can't quote me on that.  Just call your nearest dealer and ask.  If you need a body shop to paint it for you, I doubt it would cost more than $100- $200 to scuff and spray."

I made the fatal mistake of playing hide and seek. It went well for the first round or two. Then he got bored of the game, got on his bike while I was counting. The younger one ran to me in tears about him running away. He then proceeded to pedal away as I tried to coax him inside. This was before cell phones were really a thing and there was no way to contact anyone. ""Luckily"" he came back ten minutes later (around the time I got the younger one to stop crying), my bluff of not following him worked. Then we went inside and I got them slices of pie and made the mistake of going to the bathroom. When I got out, the house was eerily silent. I ran upstairs and found the guest bedroom door locked. He'd locked himself in with the younger cousin who began wailing as the older one put on a scary movie (Jaws I think). He refused to let me in and I began to cry too.

howoriginal4532,college,1388568726.0,"Finally, a question I feel like I can contribute to! I'm a Miami dweller attending Florida International University, a public school about ten miles from UMiami.

University of Miami is relatively competitive to be admitted to. I was admitted, but had a decent GPA, high SAT/ACT scores, and great letters of recommendation. Life on campus is what I would assume to be very ""traditional college"" in that the dorms are small, the percentage of students living on campus is high, Greek life is prominent, and school spirit is high.

However, I found the student body to be a bit snooty and stuck-up. UMiami is a very expensive, private school and the students attending seem to have a superiority complex. Maybe this was just the students I met in particular, but I toured the campus twice and have attended numerous parties there and was really rubbed the wrong way by a lot of people I met there. Of course, your mileage may vary and I hope you get the opportunity to tour the campus. UMiami used to be my top choice, but the tour completely changed my opinion.

The U is pretty close to Downtown, but is located in the neighborhood of Coral Gables and very close to Coconut Grove, two neighborhoods that are known for their student atmospheres and nightlife. It is VERY expensive to attend UMiami, especially as an out-of-state student. Living on campus is expensive and the same applies to the surrounding neighbourhoods if you choose to go off-campus.

Have you given FIU any consideration? It is located out West and is a public, state school known for its Business College. If you want to go to college in Miami, and UMiami doesn't appeal to you, then this is a great choice! It's CHEAP (you can do undergrad here and then do med school at UMiami; a lot of students do this to save money) and a majority of the student body are Miami natives who will know the town well and can show you around. Just know that it is a commuter school and you may not get the ""traditional"" college experience because of it. Don't be fooled though, there are plenty of things to do at FIU. I am having the time of my life living on campus and going Greek.

bottom line: Maybe do a little more research? If you're looking to go to school in Miami (top priority for me when I was doing the college search), please consider FIU if UMiami turns out to not be your cup of tea. I HIGHLY encourage you to tour any schools that you are accepted to before you commit. It's what sealed the deal for me between UMiami and FIU and I couldn't possibly be any happier.

Feel free to PM me about anything Miami related and good luck with your search!"

Hope you had a great night.

Just wanted to ask about the cables: 

How do these compare to the standard black set of cables that come with the PSU by default?

Are these softer or stiffer to work with in comparison?

Is the PCI-e cable for the GPU (2x 6+2) the sane shape as the black one (the default ones split into two 6+2s near the GPU end). Do the whites split near the GPU or near the PSU?

Are any of the cables different in make (shape, length, number of sata outs on the cables etc) compared to the standard blacks? 

And finally, without the 24Pin, what would you be asking for the cables? 

Thanks a ton.

Have a good one.

capughe,loseit,1388573235.0,"Theoretically, just eating less will let you lose weight. You should have success at the start since you have a fair amount to lose. Drink loads of water. Aim for 3L.

Check out /r/keto and/or /r/paleo if you so desire (I don't think paleo is historically/scientifically sound but it is a mite better than the SAD since its cutting out processed crap and I haven't looked to closely at it to be honest).

I recommend keto because I find I am less hungry and more energetic when I'm off carbs. Personally, I'm diabetic so I have some carb sensitivity that you might not have and maybe regular low cal will work for you. However, I think most people on keto report more satisfaction with their meals and less hunger and cravings than those who just limit calories. If you decide to try keto, DRINK LOADS OF WATER (aim for 4L min) and EAT YOUR DAMN VEGGIES (or else constipation hell).

As for not buying your own food; you're almost 17: take some control. Go shopping with whoever gets your food. I find it hard to believe your provider is going to deny you fresh vegatables, fruit (if paleo) and meat (not like you're sneaking fruit roll-ups and cocoa puffs into the card). These diets are all *real* food.Check out /r/keto and/or /r/paleo if you so desire (I don't think paleo is historically/scientifically sound but it is a mite better than the SAD). They might say no to 1000lbs of bacon and steak, but chicken thighs and ground meats are cheap by comparison to leaner cuts and easy to prepare. I find this diet is rather affordable if you actually cook your own food and don't live in Nunavut or somewhere fresh veg is hard to get.

Get some eggs (I like to have some hard boiled and ready to eat in the fridge), cheese, nuts and cold cuts for snacking too.

As soon as you can, get moving. Even if its just walking in circles for 30min a few times a week it should help. Ramp it up as you start to feel better.

The major assumptions are in how he compares computers to human brains. I believe he is comparing transistors in a CPU to synapses in a human brain (or maybe nerve cells). Since there are huge differences between a transistor and a neuron or synapse, this is only a very rough estimate. We also do not know if the neurons are even doing all of the processing in the brain. There is other stuff there and it could be involved too (Glial cells are one candidate if I remember correctly). 

As other have mentioned, software has a huge impact on how effective computer intelligence will be regardless of the hardware. 

The trend of computers becoming smarter and smarter is certainly true, but I wouldn't put too much weight in these particular metrics."

Still, I really liked Tara and I really liked Willow/Tara (when it was healthy, anyway) too. Lots of people seem to act like you must pick one or the other, but I just liked both. They were quite different characters and quite different relationships, and I can certainly see the merits in each.

Tara isn't my absolute favorite character or anything, but she'd certainly be in my top ten and maybe even my top five. I admittedly might be a bit biased, but I always feel a bit thrown off when people say that they hate her or whatever. She just seems so benign to me that it's hard to imagine really actively disliking her, you know? I can totally get people not being interested in her character or not feeling connected to her or whatever, but I've come across some pretty angry Tara haters before and it always kind of confuses me since Tara was really quite sweet.

kungtotte,AskReddit,1388574930.0,"It's not. You have a daily energy requirement in terms of calories. If you eat that many calories (give or take) you will maintain your current weight. If you eat more you will gain weight. If you eat less you will lose weight.

That's it. There is no other secret to losing (or gaining) weight. It's all about how much you eat versus how much you expend.

Theoretically you could consume your entire daily energy in one single meal, but that would probably make you feel like shit most of the time since you'd be full to bursting for a few hours and then feel like you're starving for the rest of the day. Spacing it out over the course of the day is more of a mental thing to make you feel satiated which helps you not snack between meals, and helps you to not overestimate how much you should eat for your next meal.

Your metabolism is not subject to change (unless you have a metabolic disorder, which most people don't). It's not higher in the morning, it doesn't need food to get it going apart from the simple fact that you need to eat stuff in order to metabolise it at all, eating right before bed won't make you fat assuming that it doesn't put you over your daily energy requirement."

I have met a guy here in central Oregon who operates a commercial drone business. He builds his own remotely-piloted vehicles, employs licensed pilots to fly them, and hires them for photography. The ROV can go places a human pilot cannot. 

For instance, he works with ODOT to assist with bridge inspections. To inspect a bridge like the one over the Crooked River on US97, ODOT would have to close a lane for days to hang scaffolding over the side, accept the risk of putting a human on it, and move the scaffold as needed to check the whole structure. With the ROV, he can share a direct video feed with a bridge engineer and have his pilot put the camera exactly where the engineer needs it in real time. A multi-week job gets done in a day. And if that doesn't impress you, think of the fuel savings alone by not having to place and remove scaffold and get workers back and forth to the site for weeks. 

This is not theoretical, this is happening.

ActuallyAnAlpaca,Conservative,1388576532.0,"&gt; In June 2004, the U.S. Department of Agriculture updated its 2002 analysis of the issue and determined that the net energy balance of ethanol production is 1.67 to 1. For every 100 BTUs of energy used to make ethanol, 167 BTUs of ethanol is produced. In 2002, USDA had concluded that the ratio was 1.35 to 1. The USDA findings have been confirmed by additional studies conducted by the University of Nebraska and Argonne National Laboratory.

&gt; These figures take into account the energy required to plant, grow and harvest corn -- as well as the energy required to manufacture and to distribute ethanol.

""May be"". No supporting evidence. Conjecture at this point  


&gt; the corn-based ethanol program wastes economic resources and redistributes incomes often in socially undesirable ways, it is a hard program to kill.


Corn subsidies have lasted for a long time. Look at HFCS, and all the other ways it's used instead of sugar. I wouldn't call it a good food either.  



Gasoline isn't green, isn't efficient, and also shouldn't be subsidized.

As far as learning the fights and hopping into LFR - take a quick browse over some guides for the bosses and don't be afraid to whisper the other tank and let them know you're new and just need a quick overview.

most of the fights in SoO LFR are tank swaps and ""move out of bad stuff"" the same thing you've always had to do...

While I'm standing at the redbox two drunk guys in their car, not even in the lot, but from the road, start yelling at me.

NahDudeFkThat,dbz,1388581981.0,"&gt;General Rilldo. As a villain I thought it was great how strong he was and the power he had. But how could he be stronger than Majin Buu? And yet as a character it seems he was simply discarded after Goku and Pan went to look for Dr. Myuu. Shown again as they were flying off the planet, but once again defeated so effortlessly. How could he have been killed just like that by three characters (Goku, Pan, Trunks) who weren't even that strong and would have struggled against Majin Buu? Maybe if that comparison was never made, I could believe it and it wouldn't have bugged me, but since the comparison was made by Goku it bugged me to no end how easily this villain was defeated.

Pan, although weaker than Rhildo, is no pushover. Right after Goku gets the sense that Rhildo is even stronger than Buu, Pan lands a solid punch and drops him. Now Rhildo was not at his maximum fighting power, but he was still powerful enough just standing around to give off such massive energy - and Pan landed. Meaning, Pan's power level is definitely in the realms of the levels reached by the villains in the Buu saga, but is made to be weak in comparison to the GT villains.

Trunks is even stronger than Pan, and Goku is as well. Goku in Base form was able to tool Rhildo damn near effortlessly. It is until Rhildo decides to transform into his ultimate form that he puts up a fight against a starved, weakened Goku.

A max powered blast from all 3 of them simultaneously was more than enough to whip out Rhildo."

Raged SSJ2 Vegeta, a mortal who evaded and inflicted damage on Beerus, and even withstood a direct melee attack from Beerus, is roughly 8000 times weaker than GT SSJ4 Goku from the Shadow Dragon Saga. (Base GT Goku in the shadow dragon saga is much stronger than SSj3 Goku from Z, easily in the realm of power Raged SSj2 Vegeta was maybe stronger, now add in the multipliers for the ssj stages:

ssj 1 in GT = base x100 said so by Rhildo, so 100 Raged SSJ2 Vegetas

SSJ2 is double that

SSJ3 is SSj2x 4

And finally SSJ4 is 10 times SSJ3

So SSJ4 is Base x 8000)

It is true that a better school will likely do a better job of teaching you the concepts you need to know to get your first programming job and one with a better reputation will lift more eyebrows,  which can help when getting that first job or impressing a client, but those things have substitutes.

If you have a good work ethic and learn quickly, you can generally teach yourself the material even if your teacher is terrible (which has been the case at my current school), and if you can get a bunch of impressive experience under your belt by the time you graduate (contributing to open source projects, creating your own finished programs, good work experience), you'll raise just as many brows."

What few items that make it to Public Domain get used by so many it's unfair to criticize the result as being inferior in quality because of overuse.

You have little to no reason for continuing to interact with her if it makes you unhappy. That said, you can try to improve your ""here is how I feel"" muscle by attempting to react to her in real time. This is a skill you will need many times in the future so why not try to develop it now?

Since this situation is Ongoing, you might try to work out how you could react in the future when she says something similar to the things she has said in the past. Write down a really good reaction like ""Ouch!"" or ""that hurt my feelings."" The best answer may not come to you in real time right away but it will come sooner and sooner if you keep at it, and eventually it will come in time.

By the way, don't expect her to like it when you change the dynamics of how you interact. When you stop participating
In someone's game, their usual reaction is to play harder. Keep at it. Eventually she will discover that you aren't playing her game any more, and she will find a new way to interact with you."

eurephys,assassinscreed,1388585175.0,"It's been built many times. People use a ring attached to other end of the blade which releases a catch.

However, they're flimsy and they don't retract.

I've been thinking about how it would be done, and thought of a two-way spring thingie. The system people have made to extend the blade works, but instead of the pinkie, the thumb will extend it. As soon as it extends fully, the blade hooks onto a catch at the end which is attached to another mechanism held by a ring on the pinkie. It'll have two springs powering it, one at each end of the shaft.

When you extend it with your thumb, one spring retracts and shoots out and before the other spring rebounds it, the other hook catches it and holds it in place. Same when it gets retracted.

The only problem with the system is that it gets bulky and I have no faith in the second catch when it's extended, in that it's very likely to retract as soon as you stab something.

It's why I think a switchblade-style hidden blade works better practically. Easier to build and more durable as you're not putting direct strain on the catch system when stabbing."

1. It's a children's movie. The dialogue doesn't have much nuance or subtlety, so there's less to lose in translation.
2. It's comedy. If the joke doesn't work in your language, you can switch it out with one that does.

hippiemachine,jobs,1388586203.0,"Nowhere terribly special- central Virginia. We don't really have a good tech job market, but there are jobs. I got my first job through a combo of good luck, impressive work experience and being willing to work a crappy first job for equally crappy pay.

The main reason job offers are raining in now is because I've managed to accrue almost 2 years of experience while getting my post-bac. 

I started out as a simple tech writer at a small local software company since I had no programming skills to speak of, and within 6 months I had learned through both school and tutoring with my programmer co-workers how to write my own primitive software with an ugly, 90's looking UI. In a few more months, I made my own primitive web app and started contributing code to their company product in addition to my new QA duties.

All that experience opened the door to my second job, as a ""developer success engineer"" at a company that offers services to other developers. This is the job I suggested to OP, since he sounds like he has a similar skillset to me.

I've found it to be wonderful job in that it forces you to learn the basics of several new languages, their frameworks, databases, and various workflows that our clients use so that you can better help them. It also allows you to network like a mo-fo; I have engineering connections at all major tech companies and many major non-tech ones as well because they use our product, and all of them were impressed by how much I've been able to help them and have hinted at future jobs (can't though.. non-compete agreements prevent it, but the offers are appreciated).

Because of all the experience I've acquired through my most recent job, recruiters have also been contacting me on LinkedIn for both local and more remote jobs. However, I'm happy where I'm at now so I haven't been entertaining them.

tl;dr - Definitely go for that internship, and a job if you can swing it. Also, make a LinkedIn profile, add your contacts to it, and keep it up to date on your current skills. Recruiters will come to you like flies to cheesecake."

DinnerBlasterX,Warthunder,1388586861.0,"Okay here we go, on mobile so this is gonna be tricky.

1. Starting out as USA is a fine decision but know that you will not find a good turn fighter in the lineup, and a lot of the early USA aircraft are quite bad until you start getting to planes that are coated in .50 cals.

2. Whatever you do do NOT buy crew points, Gaijin did something with 1.37 that just makes the game print hundreds of crew points.

3. When picking ammo belts, get belts with as much incendiary rounds as possible for MG's and belts with as much high explosive rounds as possible for cannons.  Usually these would be stealth belts, but you have to know your plane well to use them effectively.  Also if a plane has an 'air target' belt take that one instead.

4.  Premium vehicles usually are just to earn extra income, however some can be fun to play.  Some premium aircraft are great for their tier, (BTD Destoyer, American Spit mk IX, I-153P Chaika,etc). And some are just not worth it, (Russian PBY, He7a1, Type 28 Ishak, etc)

5. Yes.  Bailing successfully and soft landing a plane both reduce repair costs immensely by saving the pilot.  Landing at base in any game mode will repair you for free.  For domination, go to settings and disable auto ground avoidance, learn to cap bases at high speeds (your wheels need to touch the ground).  I personally have six crew slots for every country, but usually if you pick targets carefully you may not die at all.

The way you support and protect your kids at immense cost is beautifully applaudable. It sucks that the universe is still throwing shit after you, but you're awesome. Keep it up."

i_am_a_freethinker,mormon,1388588776.0,"I'll answer two ways, Mormon heaven and my heaven.

Mormon heaven, as you know, includes us being with God forever. We, too, will be able to create worlds and organize intelligences. As we progress and grow, we will become more like God. By obeying certain celestial Laws, we can become a god unto the Most High.

For eternity, we will be able to bring immorality and eternal life to our spirit children. It will be our greatest joy. We will not know pain or death or dissatisfaction. Great will be our power and endless our Priesthood.

Men will probably have more than one wife. She will be subservient to him, as it has always been. It's an inherently sexist setup. Nevertheless, apparently we won't mind much, because everyone is always happy and joyful.

We will demand to be worshipped by our children. If they disobey us, we will have no choice but to punish them. If they commit sins that they do not repent of, then they will get a disproportionate punishment of eternal damnation.



Now, my heaven. My heaven includes people we care about, of course. Not necessarily family, because some people have really fucked up family systems. I really don't want to see a few of my extended family for more than I have to.

We'll have the capacity to learn and grow. We'd still be able to suffer pain, but nothing horrible. Discomfort is sometimes okay.

We'd have essentially unlimited resources to make whatever the fuck we want. Need a planet-sized Mech? You got it!

We'd live for at least a few hundred years. Past that, though, I think I would get bored.

Yes, my heaven wouldn't be eternal. I would like more life than our mortality gives us, but even an endless orgasm would eventually become passe.

We'd still be able to make mistakes! I said I thought that the Mormon god was in Hell. Here is why: God is bound by laws. He is also perfect. He must remain perfect to remain a god. He is also omniscient. He knows every possible outcome of every decision. Where does that leave him?

He has to choose the most perfect choice every time. Even if it is as innocuous as choosing what to eat for breakfast, he *has to make the most perfect choice*. Even if he wanted to make a less-perfect choice, or a mistake, he cannot. He has lost his Free Agency. He is in Hell, never deviating from the ""perfect plan,"" forever. 

Anyways, once you're bored in my heaven, you can cease to exist. You can puff out of existence, and finally be at ultimate peace. Heaven shouldn't last for eternity, that is just cruel."

&gt; some of the responses [here] are seriously just pandering.

People coming forth and being honest about what they like don't deserve to be put down like that just because their opinions go against the grain. As for what you see in other subs and in real life: consider also that women who prefer these cut, muscular guys, are probably just much more vocal about their preferences than others, and possibly have a higher prioritization for announcing how hot David Beckham gets them than other women. That's how you get celebrity worship, and an overwhelming number of people clamoring for zero body fat."

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388589710.0,"&gt;That doesn't explain how countries developed before there was a developed world to aid them

France, Britain etc. spent the better part of 3 centuries from about 1500-1800 making very small gains that started to directly pay off big in the 1820-1870 period. 

And in many cases, including in europe, countries benefited from British, French, Spanish Dutch and Portuguese imperialism and industrialization, because Britain had more money than it knew what to do with, it was able to heavily trade for things it wanted from the continent, as were the others to a lesser degree.

Scotland received direct subsidy from London for decades, and then benefited from North Sea oil.  Their story isn't exactly complicated.

sir_sri,sto,1388590454.0,"The dyson proc is nice, but it's still lower EH than the elite fleet shield. 

&gt;Yeah the cap is lower

The cap isn't all that relevant.  Well in PVP it is to some limited degree. 

Effective health matters more than cap though.  Because you take less damage per shot with the Elite fleet shield (versus antiproton you take 65% of the damage in EFS versus 70% in a Dyson, and against disruptor or against other damage types the EFS pulls ahead a lot.

1 point of healing is 1 point of healing, no matter the shield type.  But 1 point of healing recovers from more incoming damage on the elite fleet shield.


That said, particularly if you want to play with the full dyson set I think there's a pretty compelling case for that whole set being particularly strong for non A2B tanking - a little bit of extra  hull bleed through isn't a problem if you're running any hull heals, and if you have enough shield heals then overhealing isn't as much of a problem, and you get a lot of cooldowns to survive a lot of things going wrong.    Which makes the upcoming voth zone  interesting, because maybe you'll actually *need* (or want) all those heals.  "

dusmeyedin,AskReddit,1388591499.0,"I'm not very good with scientific futorology, so I'll keep my guesses to vague social ethics.

- In the developed world, the idea of being ""married"" to somebody is going to be old-fashioned and limiting and odd. Marriage will become a social contract. Most limitations on its functions, scope, and demographic will be lifted. (E.g. two adult children from the same set of parents may declare a domestic partnership to pool their wealth to help take care of their ageing parents - in a sort of ""reverse generational"" function of traditional marriage's focus on pooling wealth to raise children.)

- The treatment of animals will become more ethically consistent. Current social laws are arbitrarily fine with industrialized slaughter of meat species, institutionalized castration or sterilization of pet species, and outlier laws that punish human mistreatment of certain pets. A more consistent legal outlook (pets as individuals with rights? pets as possessions in which their owners have rights?) will develop.

- Birth control will reach the point where abortions are rarely used in the case of accidental or unintentional pregnancy. It may not even see much use in cases of genetically non-viable fetuses, if prenatal healthcare reaches sufficient preventative levels. Its primary (and hopefully rare) application may be in cases of rape.

- Depending on the progress of technological surveillance, the idea of random crimes against the individual may seem implausible. The same may also be said of expectations of privacy.

- If life spans extend sufficiently, the birth rate is likely to significantly reduce. Parenthood is likely to be seen as a lifestyle option rather than a social expectation - even moreso than today. The median age of an adult parenting their first child is likely to be much higher than today.

- With sufficient advances in telecommunications, the idea of physically traveling to and from a workplace each day will seem farfetched and wasteful."

Actually, behavioural therapy can be beneficial for some people to develop techniques to combat anxiety. I'm not shy, but I had severe post traumatic stress and developed panic attacks when I met my husband for some reason, because  I'm cool :/ I went to therapy and it was amazing, I was fully committed. I say it's amazing but only the end result was amazing. It was emotionally taxing and it felt unbareable at times but worth it in the end.

Since that period of PTSD, I am prone to anxiety but I force myself to kick it in the ass and do things that I really don't want to do but it gets easier. Some people have difficulty doing that and require antidepressants and there is no shame in it. One of the hardest steps is seeking help.

I have an above-average-sensitivity sense of smell.

I can walk through a kitchen hours after somebody's finished cooking and have a pretty accurate guess of what they cooked. I'm good at detecting spices and tastes.

However, I am physically unable to detect the smell of marijuana. I have walked through hippie districts of West Coast cities with friends, and they'll complain about the skunk smell and I'll sniff the air bemusedly. I've helped a friend clean up a room after the departure of a pothead tenant, and they've held up a beer can bong and said it reeks - I'll have my nose next to it and be unable to smell anything.

This is why I said it's not okay to escalate a situation and retaliate because it often gets out of control- how often is it just a slap for a slap? Not only that, but men typically hit harder than women- a slap from a man unless he is intentionally holding back is probably going to have more force than a slap from a woman. And if you're retaliating, you're probably not going to stop and think and hold back on how hard you strike someone- you're hitting back in a moment of passion.

phaqueue,wow,1388592675.0,"It's not that it's really hard, it's just different...

You have to look at the fight/raid differently...

A lot of it really comes down to Situational Awareness 

As a DPS, your situational awareness is really ""move away from things that will kill me"", as a healer - you have the ""move away from things that will kill me"" but ""keep the tanks/raid alive"" is also added, as well as knowing when a fight mechanic might happen that will need someone to be healed (prisons on sha of pride for instance)

As a tank, you need to have the situational awareness of moving out of things that will kill you, but there's a lot more added as well. You need to be aware of which way the boss (or even some trash) is pointing, so you're not hitting the raid with things like breaths and such, this includes while moving the boss if necessary (you don't want to try to move out of fire and breath the whole raid because you weren't paying attention)

You also need to be aware of the mobs hitting you and more importantly, if they stop hitting you. The mobs should be hitting only you (or you and your offtank) for the most part, and if you suddenly get a ""changed target"" warning, you need to figure out why and fix it, rapidly. 

This isn't necessarily more difficult, it's just a different way of thinking, and really the only way to build this awareness is to do it. When you first start, you will likely miss things, you will breath the group, you will make mistakes... When those mistakes happen, you should be asking ""why did I die"" or ""why did we wipe"" or ""why did x happen"" and figuring out how to fix it. Did you die to a big spike from a big boss ability? Ok, so could you have avoided that ability (like the smash on Malkorok) or could you use a cooldown? Did you use all your cooldowns and still die? Did you notice yourself at low health for a long time and get no heals? 

Figuring out why you died is a big step in getting better...

When you run LFR as a tank - ask the other tank for advice - a lot of times you will have people in there who are experienced and want to help"

dewprisms,changemyview,1388592844.0,"Right, which is why I said it's different. If someone is attacking you and is clearly going to cause harm to you beyond a stinging cheek from a slap or something else that is minor and a one time hit (which is again not okay to do to someone else), a person is justified in attempting to defend themselves.

That said, I still don't think punching back is an appropriate response- it has a different level of force. Restraining or otherwise disabling someone without potentially giving them a grievous injury in return is the appropriate path to take. Even if you're just defending yourself, you're going to have a bad time if someone was slapping and kicking and punching at you who was significantly weaker and you punch them and they wind up with a concussion or crushed eye socket unless that was literally the only way out of the situation. It sucks that law enforcement would see it that way, but law enforcement also recognizes levels of force for a reason.

In /u/atheist_at_arms example they said they wouldn't risk their future trying to protect someone who attacked them- it's also about protecting yourself. Unless you have a lot of witnesses or some other clear evidence that's more than just people's words, chances are you'd get yourself in hot water if you escalated the situation to stop it and seriously hurt the other party, especially if you are male and the other party is a female in some places, due to laws being drawn out in a way that often men are automatically implicated in situations even if the female started it, or even did all of the aggressive behavior. It's really shitty that's how it is, but it should be considered to keep yourself protected."

UlgraTheTerrible,bipolar,1388593674.0,"Because odds are, either they also have some social anxiety, *or* they, unlike us, are not living in near social isolation... Meaning, essentially, it's on you because *you* need/want the friend, not them. It's a lot like finding a boy/girlfriend... There's a courtship dance involved, a period where you try to impress each other and bond over stuff you have in common, etc... 

But first, you have to say ""Hello!"" :p

Anyways, as for filling your days, I suggest first scheduling time for self-care... Make your bed, shower, hair and makeup (if you wear it), get dressed, and do it mindfully, with care and attention. Don't forget to add exercise, maybe go for a short walk before you get ready or in the early evening if sweat isn't your thing... 

I always find I feel much better about life and myself if I try to take the time to do something kind for someone at least once during the day. This can be anything from complimenting someone when they look awesome to making cookies for a neighbor, to lending a hand to a family member doing a task. The major key here is not to expect or require any thanks or reciprocation. You can do it on the down low, or make it obvious, but it *will* make you feel good about yourself either way. 

Do try to go outside for at least fifteen minutes a day, and for the love of God, try to keep your sleep to approximately 8 hours, because oversleeping can make depression worse. 

Watch some Netflix to fulfill the empty hours if you need to, and don't feel guilty... If you want, watch something educational or horizon broadening so you can feel like you're accomplishing something. 

Good luck!

2) I don't see what would be shameful about view 1 you stated. I offer to pay because I genuinely offer to pay. He might not have a much money as me and offering to pay is polite. Plus, I really don't like people paying for me. I don't think many people do. I do accept that this is common for first dates though.

When you change your position and restore blood back to the area, it gradually awakens and you get the ""pins and needles"" sensation which is brought about by those nerves ""awakening"" and resuming sending their messages to the brain.

EDIT: also, about the reasoning thing, he didn't blame me at all and said it was ""Me being selfish. Its my reaction to trying to make there be fewer noises/distractions. I hate it"" and ""Baby please dont feel bad because im just a dick. You didnt do anything wrong :("". 

He's honestly not an asshole. He just does really rude/weird things that I don't understand at all. Reddit helped me make sure it wasn't normal and also figure out how to tell him he was acting a bit of a prick. 

It also helped me to contextualize it because when I read your ""get a new boyfriend"" thing, I went ""but that's not what I want"". Sometimes when I am emotional like that I don't really know what I want, so thank you as well for showing me one possible answer.

EDIT: The reason this happens is because the nerves supplying the eyes and facial muscles are called cranial nerves and are located on the brain stem, which is not damaged during decapitation. But because the lungs are removed and the vocal chords are most likely gone, there is no speech."

laurenceandglaciers,soccer,1388595528.0,"I originally was gonna say I think this was the worse we've played since opening day against Man City, but I've changed my mind, this was far, far worse. 

I cannot understand how Ameobi came out for the 2nd half let alone lasted until the 75th minute until he was brought off. He was the definition of awful, all he offers is aerial threat, but I don't think he won a single header all game, plus his control was woeful.

You could pick any of our players and find about five or six occasions when they gave the ball away, either with poor passes or woeful touches. 

Debuchy was fucking stupid, you can't tackle like that, the guy went down easy for the pen, but it was a pen.

I think everyone wanted Ben Arfa on at half time because the first half was so poor, but I really think he should've brought off Ameobi and not Gouffran, as Ameobi in my opinion was so poor. But Ben Arfa again showed the weakest part of his game, his decision making is awful, it showed against Arsenal and it showed here again, he needs to get his head up early and realise what the best option is, because most of the time, the best option isn't trying to dribble past six players. 

I could understand this kind of performance against a top team or a team in good form, but West Brom are neither, they hadn't won for nine games.

All in all, you have to say fair play to West Brom, they were by far the better side. We ended up showing our near-relegation form from last year, hopefully Pardew can turn it around quickly."

joshlrogers,dotnet,1388595875.0,"I am sorry, I guess I disagree at even the fundamental level of your argument.  DI is intrinsically tied to having a container.  Demanding dependencies, is itself IoC, which is separate from DI.  When you have a class that accepts a limited number of contracts, essentially demanding its dependencies, that in and of itself is simply IoC.

However, when you have an object graph that is composed entirely by a container and the dependencies are injected as needed by said container only then do you have DI.

Also, you're right to a point, that the answer to not using a DI container while still utilizing IoC is that the class accepts(read: demands) factories that compose the dependencies.  Factories are still an often used pattern even when using DI containers.  However, without DI, this stands the potential to become unwieldy especially in the hands of less experienced developers because at the end of the day you're still responsible for the creation of the object graph.  Often you will ultimately see an inordinate number of factory classes to support the graph creation when all of that could have been abstracted away in a container.  This is where my argument that DI often lends itself to cleaner code that adheres more strictly to SRP ultimately lies.

Zaiton,AskReddit,1388596188.0,"Relevant story. When I was 15, during my Open Water Diver course the water was quite cold. This was in Sweden in the middle of may. After the first dive, the staff was setting up a grill and everybody was trying to get a bit warmer. Seeing as we had some time until food was ready I decided that I would take a quick jog along the shore to get warmer and get my circulation going. [This is the beach](http://www.dykarna.nu/photos/dykplatsfoton/1-2010-06-28224012.jpg) 

After a few minutes, the shore became gradually more rocky and bouldery so naturally I kept running up these rocks. It had rained earlier so these rocks were apparently quite slippery. As I was running, my feet lost their grip and I fell forward teeth-first. 

As I got up, I felt no pain. I started probing around with my tongue in my mouth and everything seemed to be fine at first until I got to my front teeth. They weren't there anymore. Smashed three of them quite badly and I just remember being in a state of shock. I was sad, scared and shocked. I remember running back to my parents on the verge of tears and showing them my teeth. Luckily for me, the ""core"" of the teeth weren't exposed, so we didn't need to rush to the ER. After having a few hot dogs(with my side-teeth, ugh that felt weird), I could finish the second dive like a champ and afterwards go to the hospital to have my teeth filled."

Scripturally women shouldn't teach in a position of church authority to other adults. Not shouldn't teach in general. Meaning she shouldn't be elder, pastor, or bishop. Sunday school teacher or random christian person giving their two cents on stuff is alright. Deacon is arguable, early church allowed it, interestingly only when some pagan influences crept in, they were disallowed. Sermon is arguable as well..

Photosaurusrex04,SkincareAddiction,1388597130.0,"I have struggled with cystic hormonal acne for quite a while. I've been losing a lot of weight recently (yay!) but was still breaking out every month about a week before my period. I got frustrated and did some research and learned it has something to do with estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone levels during your cycle. Everything I read suggested that you can try an over the counter vitamin called Vitex (aka chastetree berry) to help regulate your progesterone/estrogen levels. I couldn't find it on its own, but did find it in a female hormonal balance vitamin from a brand called femMED. let me just say, I have only had one cystic breakout since starting and it was significantly smaller than before I started. It also has the added bonus of helping with PMS. I'll try to find some articles about it and edit later. It has worked wonders for me and since it's over the counter, I don't have to deal with prescriptions or seeing a doctor/dermatologist who will either prescribe me something that won't work or that is really harsh. 

EDIT - [here's the original article I found](http://www.thelovevitamin.com/9662/q-about-vitex-agnus-castus-for-acne/#.UsRbY6jnb0w) There's a ton of good info in the article. [This](http://femmed.com/us/products/hormonal-balance/) is the stuff I've been using. It is definitely a game changer! "

'To be fair' is probably the worst thing you could have said to preface the very, very small list of POC in Disney films. That isn't 'fair' in the slightest, because insinuating that somehow white children (of any gender) are given more heroines to look up to and that is *okay* is toxic for intersectionality, and toxic for any 'minority' groups that consume media today.

'Fair' would mean totally disregarding the birthday party peanuts (or was it chocolates) in a bowl analogy and deliberately ignoring the reality- Disney has power, and with power comes responsibility. And it's our job as the queer community to look out for one another, EVEN (*gasp*) our young *NON WHITE* members."

If you have a referral process at school, use that, otherwise CPS might be the way to go.  It is very rare for a child to be schizophrenic (usually it starts post puberty, around 20 years old).  My cousin was schizophrenic and if he had been diagnosed and begun treatment when he was a preteen (when the voices started), he probably would have lived to see his 22nd birthday (we didn't know he was hearing voices or that he was schizophrenic until he was 21).

I would discuss it on or before a  second date ish.  If the underlying reason for it is (for  example) religious, well you probably want  to  discuss that broadly on a first date.  

&gt;I need it to be natural and not awkward.

When you're essentially being randomly hit on that's not going to happen easily, but then you can also be more upfront about rejecting people.  

&gt;I could appreciate any advice on how to approach this subject with guys that I am interested in.

Only discuss  dating in a place where this would commonly accepted practice or where it's explicitly upfront (say online dating where someone searching for you might be deliberately looking for someone who is abstinent until marriage, or in a religious setting where that would be a core component of beliefs). 

&gt;I am a freshman in college

Depending on the college you may find you're in an  extremely small minority (one university I went  to), or part of a sizeable minority (another I  went to).  The  trick  is finding people with similar  expectations.  


Dating is essentially a giant search tree.  The more people you won't be interested in that can be excluded with a question the earlier it should arise.  One starts with the obvious generally - of the 100% of the population that isn't you, you only look for people who are of the correct gender, speak your language, live in your general area, aren't already married, are the right age etc.  Of the dating pool for someone in their late  teens early 20's about 70% of men in the US will have already had sex, and  be expecting to have sex in a relationship, and a significant fraction of the remaining 30% will want to have sex but haven't found anyone willing yet.   If you're in europe or canada it's more like 80/20.  So you really do need to be upfront about it. 

&gt;I am OK with oral sex.

Though in the realm of consolation prizes this seems like a good one.  To some extent that can  complicate your position.  You meet someone  nice, you have oral sex, and you can say that's as far as you'll go, and they don't feel like you've wasted their time.  But it's also not really something you offer after they've said they only want a relationship with someone who will have sex.

If you are attempting to legislate the law of chastity, why not outlaw masturbation? Or divorce, per the NT? The law of chastity is a spiritual law, not a secular law. There is a difference.

In all the years that COLDS didn't let black people into the temple, did one ever sue, or successfully sue for the ability to get married in the private temples? No, of course not! Did a non-LDS hetersexual couple ever successfully sue their way in to use the temple as a wedding venue?

Civil rights are not trumping either of the freedoms you mentioned. Further, I think (there is a pretty good chance I am wrong) that you are misusing the legal terms.

Per Wikipedia: ""Freedom of religion or Freedom of belief is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, *to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance;* the concept is generally recognized also to include the freedom to change religion or not to follow any religion."" You can still treat homosexuality as a sin! You can think that acting on gay thoughts is evil. That's *okay*, legally.

That kind of access requires buying DVDs, which are $10-$20 a pop. Even then, good luck finding obscure old shows. File sharing enriches America's television consumption, allowing to cease to be about Honey Boo-Boo and be instead about quality television as art. It costs literally nothing and brings high quality entertainment to the masses who wouldn't have been able to afford it to begin with. Basically it makes PBS look like trash.

Low-income, urban schools also tend to hire more teacher interns (like TFA, they are earning their credentials as they teach).  

We all know that teaching is something you need to practice, and new teachers don't have the experience to have good classroom management.  New teachers, without support, enter and leave the profession within two years and the cycle of new teachers going into these schools continue.  My first two years of teaching were helish-- but I loved my students and I wanted to make a difference.  Now that I'm in the middle of my 7th year, I'm finally getting to be an effective teacher because I know my resources, know how to manage my classroom's behavior, and I know I'm not alone.  "

OP, there are ways to indulge the fantasy without really hurting someone, but if your partner isn't into it, it's going to be difficult/impossible.

For this reason, you can stand outside in 110 degrees and be fine, but if you were to submerge yourself in 110 degree water, you could overheat very quickly. The keyword is ""submerge"" though. In the example of the hot tub, your exposed wet skin loses heat quickly (much like in the process of sweating), which keeps your body in balance.

Similarly, if you were to sit in 50 degree water for a while, you would get colder much quicker than if you were to sit in 50 degree air. 

I think you asked this question for when the water *feels* cold/hot, but isn't nearly as cold or warm as you think. Trust me, you could *not* want to jump into 50 degree water. That's cold."

I got in the car and drove a few blocks away to a hardware store that often has a BBQ set up. I was so excited, it smelled so good and I wanted it so bad! I got a cheddar and jalapeno sausage and some pop. One bite into the sausage and I couldn't take it, it was the worst thing I had ever tasted even though I normally really like them.

ed8020,Fallout,1388598802.0,"Oh, the fucking blinders some of you people wear. I waited 11 years for FO3. The only thing that sucked about FO3 was the damned engine. The very reason you call it Oblivion with guns. The same floatie, piss poor ballistics engine that exists in NV. And for all the extra quests NV had, I still finished it in 2/3 the time I finished FO3. 

Every skeleton in FO3 told a story. It gave the game some depth that was completely lacking in NV. Every time I found one there was a reason to examine the room like I was a damned CSI. There WAS a story there, you just had to look for it. It gave the overall story layers that could not be said as well in words or quests. It made you FEEL about the game without anyone trying to tell you what to feel.

NV had a large nostalgia factor that everyone loves, assuming they played the originals. The wonderful folks at Obsidian knew damned well they could play on this. It was after all their baby, at one time. They did the whole western futuristic thing very well. But one thing I believe Bethesda did better, even better than the originals, was the whole retro futuristic angle. It was something that was kind of crucial to the originals but could only be brought to you through descriptions, Nuka Cola and pictures of vacuum tubes on a computer chip. FO3 got it into your face. It was part of almost everything. You did not need a pop up description of it.

And for those of you that cling so desperately to the iso view? The whole time I was playing FO I WISHED I could be doing it in first person. But at the time we were dealing with Quake level graphics and something definitely would have been lost. Sure, with todays technology they could make a fantastic iso squad based tactical game, but I believe the FO world is something that needs to be explored in the minutest detail. But that's just me and how I feel about it, as an old school Fallout fan. On a side note: When I read that Wasteland 2 was going with an iso view I really wasn't that excited. But after seeing what they've done with it, I'll probably pick it up, if only for the nostalgia factor.

Comparing FO3 and NV is like comparing apples. I prefer Golden Delicious, but Red Delicious are still pretty damned good.

P.S. Could we PLEASE get some god damned shooter physics? STALKER did a much better job and oh how I loved the guns in that game. When the vast majority of encounters are handled through the barrel of a gun you REALLY need to incorporate some better shooter physics. Don't be so damned touchy about the letters FPS. Just because you take guns seriously doesn't make it CoD.

faeryjessa,AskWomen,1388598830.0,"I think the 3 activities you need to be most clear on are bachelorette party, wedding shower, and day of the wedding. 

I was the maid of honor for two VERY different brides. So I had one bachelorette party with booze and a stripper, and one that was a weekend at the beach with some close girlfriends. 

I didn't have anything to do with either wedding shower, I lived out of state for one and the bride's mother handled the other, but I think traditionally its the MOH that handles that.

Day of the wedding for the first one was a huge blizzard, so the focus was keeping her calm (as she was, justifiably, freaking out) and involved a lot of booze. Day of the wedding for the other was having lots of snacks, balloons, making sure that everything was taken care of, running any errands she was worried about. The other bridesmaids helped a lot with that, too, so if you're close with them, recruit!

Both of my brides handled a lot of things themselves in terms of setting everything up (one because I was out of state, the other because she's very organized and particular and I am not) so I don't have a lot of advice there. 

Basically she's your friend, you'll have an idea of what she wants, ask her what she needs, if she's not picky, go with your gut, if she is picky go with what she wants (within reason!) "

Pit_Sweat,explainlikeimfive,1388599507.0,"There are many things going on. Firstly, on a subconscious level, you need immune system compatibility. We are constantly emitting pheromones which are odorless chemicals that influence our behavior unconsciously, and gives off information about ourselves. This is the defense mechanism that keeps us from mating with our own relatives, for example. When someone is compatible with us, we feel a greater amount of attraction to them.

This attraction is consciously perceived through a whole host of chemicals and hormones that are released. Among these are Phenylethylamine, or PEA, which is a stimulant that causes that ""butterflies"" nervous feeling when you are attracted to someone. Oxytocin is released and this causes emotional bonding to the individual, especially during sex and orgasm. Then, there is dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter that is released and creates a feeling of reward. Dopamine is at the root of all addiction, and so when you are in love with someone, you are literally addicted to them like a drug.

There are more, but these are the basics. Of course, when people say two people have ""good chemistry,"" they are referring to other things as well such as a compatible sense of humor and personality, etc. But those are just some of the biological processes that occur during ""love."""

- All metal eyelets (NO speedhooks)
- Antique edge dressing

Soles have some wear, obviously, but they aren't even close to being broken in. There are some minor scuffs that I have tried to highlight in the photos. Will ship in original box with original shoe bags. I'll throw in a pair of Woodlore shoe trees for $10 if you'd like. These retailed for $315, and the standard beefroll penny loafers you can get directly from Rancourt run about $260

Offered here for $160 $150 with CONUS shipping

He doesn't have an excuse because he genuinely doesn't know and isn't going to just make one up to satisfy me. He never said I should turn my feelings off, just that he doesn't want me to feel ""bad"", in this context it was me feeling embarrassed and hurt. It's normal to want your loved ones to not feel bad. He can't take back what he did, but I'm glad he regrets it and understands how much it hurt me. 

It happens often but this is the first time I've actually confronted him about it (mostly in part to a lot of urging from this community). I don't think he even knew it bothered me as much as it did.

Vitaligo started around my eyes and finger tips. I now have splotches at the corners of my lips, my wrists and inner fore arms, hands, chest and groin that i know of. They over time spread and get bigger. They become a nice visable pink when im in the sun too long and burn a bit easier.  

Vitaligo will effect the appearance of tattoos as you are changing the color of the skin that the pigment was put into.  My pirate pin up has a blak boot that had dark blue in it for depth and variance. It now has a lighter blue/grey spot for the skin tone going away.

Malphael,Smite,1388600075.0,"When I first started playing Smite, I really enjoyed a lot of Squiddish's content that he produced for Youtube. He's not an MLG player, but I do think that he's got a legitimately good sense of humor and produces some funny and entertaining content for his Youtube channel. Whenever he does a game with Drybear or Mez, it's pretty much guaranteed to be an entertaining show. 

Since he's started streaming on Smitegame, I've noticed that he's gotten worse with the negativity. I still like his youtube content but since that's for the most part content that he's edited and sometimes scripted, it's not that surprising.

He does have some bad habits, a lot of which revolve around not recognizing his mistakes. For example, every so often he will clearly wiff an ability but not notice and suddenly ""HOW DID THAT NOT HIT?! Ok game..."" when the reality is that he simply missed. 

Another one people complain (although truthfully this applies to most streamers in just about any game) about is ""Focus the Streamer"" which in my opinion boils down to one of three causes:

1: The streamer over-extended (because aggressive plays make for more entertaining content) and got caught out.

2: The streamer is playing a focusable class

3: The streamer is the best player on the team and it makes sense to try and shut the best player down.

I hope he improves because as I said, I do actually like watching him, but for the time being, I've kinda stuck to avoiding his streams in favor of his youtube posts. "

Because of this, cold water ""feels"" different from hot water, therefore it creates a slightly different experience which people develop preferences for."

While they may not ultimately mean anything, those interactions can seriously affect your psychological development. What 14 year old is going to believe it when someone older says to not worry about it? Nearly every teenager goes through that selfish stage and can't see beyond themselves. A tiny slight that would probably be forgotten by the end of the day will now never disappear. That small, probably accidental slight, could be the difference between a happy adult, who grew beyond childish actions, and a dead teenager on the evening news.

I'm just saying that I'm not too far removed from high school to forget how enormous every tiny thing seems, and can't imagine an infallible memory would be conducive to healthy psychological development."

I'm not being selfish but when someone brings me along so that I can be DD or so that I'm there to watch coats then I'm not going to become someone's butler. I'd just rather sleep early and go for a run, skateboard, or play disc golf early in the morning and enjoy a new day. And sometimes I make new friends doing one of those things.

Example edit- Last night was one of these times. I had made plans to go out with some friends of mine. It was going to be a huge gathering of people but only four people ""decided"" to show up. I later learned that my ""friend"" wanted me to drive because I didn't have a date and wasn't going to hook up with anyone so I wasn't going to drink. She also made it so that I was to believe she invited a bunch of people who were single, male and female, but in reality she didn't. It was just a facade for me to drive them downtown and drive them back home. When I learned that she didn't invite some of my friends that she said she did then I decided I was going to stay home. So I just stayed home and was on Reddit all night. 

 TL;DR- Friend told me to go out with her and her friends last night but only wanted a ride back home. She said she invited a bunch of people but in reality she invited a couple and her SO.

FreeYeti,seduction,1388600555.0,"your ego never goes away. it's that little voice in your head that try's to protect you. it tells you you can skip your workout this day of the week or you can eat that extra cupcake (because it genuinely wants to help you, by making your life easier). this not the type of protection you need. by listening to your ego you are not acting on your true desires, therefore causing discontent.

you slowly build up the muscle of willpower by saying no to your ego as much as you can. then, as time passes, you are able to disregard that voice in your head. but it's not out of anger, like ""fuck you, ego!"", but out of appreciation, like ""thanks ego, for trying to watch out for my well being, but I know what's best for me"". this is where i'm trying to find peace.

it'll be okay dude. we all struggle with this on the inside. most people don't even know they can free themselves. be thankful you've been given this opportunity. positivity is the key. it may feel pointless at times, but I really found a way to not feel weak when being positive by accepting positivity as a part of the man I want to become."

NotSoSlenderMan,funny,1388600897.0,"I agree. But I also think that it isn't a necessity for the humor to push the overall story. Family Guy did this brilliantly in it's first view seasons. I get discouraged buy the people who say, ""ITT people who think Family Guy USED to be better."" but it's true. They've expanded and adapted their audience and it doesn't register with the people who started watching it. I'm sure the middle school/high school kids nowadays find it just as hilarious as I used to. They might not even get the first seasons. It's demographic stayed the same, but the ones who started watching it no longer fit that demographic.


To me, that's also becoming the case with American Dad. It's still fairing better than Family Guy but it is younger.  It used to be about a goofy CIA agent and his family who happened to be harboring an insane alien. Now it's about a almost mentally handicapped man and his wife who deal with their super feminist/liberal daughter, geek loser son, lame fish, and flamboyantly gay alien. It's taking after Family Guy. The characters are being fleshed out instead of just being there. 

I'd say that's why there's hit or miss episodes now. Episodes that focus on character development and are overall plot driven aren't as good as when they characters we were introduced to participate in random shenanigans.


I've been talking out of my ass, but I'd also add that's why South Park holds up so well. Sure it's changed a bit, but more so along with the culture and society. Matt &amp; Trey know what they are doing and keep doing it very well."

Willravel,arrow,1388601253.0,"I was ready to hate the show when it started. I was a fairly vocal critic of *Smallville*, how they'd Disnified and Dawson's Creekafied some of my favorite characters, and how much of a slice of plain white bread Welling was in the lead. When they announced *Arrow*, I worried that they'd try the same thing again, a teen drama with some light superpowers, very little consequences, and bland world building (sorry, Smallville fans, it really wasn't my cup of tea). 

Then the pilot hit and it was impressive. Beyond the fact that they appeared to finally understand that violence hurts, physically and emotionally, the world building was in place, and there was a lot more potential for growth. And in the next episode we saw that growth, and in basically every episode since. The show moves at 90 miles per hour (or km per hour, I think it's shot in Canada), and it never sacrifices character or plot or action. Yes, the screen is covered in pretty people, but unlike CW shows like *Beauty and the Beast*, they rest on their Laurels (get it?) by just showing pretty people being pretty. 

Looking back, now, even the episodes that aren't my favorite are still a ton of fun. I've found myself becoming a really devoted fan, looking forward to Friday, and then Wednesday.

Anyone who claims there's a unified feminist orthodoxy loses a lot of credibility with me. This is ignoreing a lot about the history of feminism. So I have some issues with this article and some related issues with Paglia. 

I think both Paglia and the author, Bari Weiss, are more sensationalistic than effective. I agree with some of Paglia's ideas, strongly disagree with others, but overall I find it distasteful how she presents ideas. There's a air of authoritative absolutism that I find both unhelpful and archaic. If Paglia or Weiss actually want a discussion of these ideas they need to talk with people rather than talking at them."

* Once you have that number, think about how many of those frustrations you still remember.
* Ask yourself, are the ones you remember because you did or did not come to terms with it?

Think about all of those things you can't remember. Don't you think if it was important you would have remembered them? If it's not important, and we truly have gotten over it, then why do we need to remember that Johnny was an asshole an January 7th, 2114 at 8:46 AM?

Now bring your hands apart.  Notice how the string gets tighter.  This is because the galaxies are growing *and* moving in space (like how you grow bigger every day as you run around and play).  Now pull the string tight.  this is how far away the galaxy actually is from us.  However light is really slow over those distances (because the universe is HUGE) so to us, it looks like the galaxy is still as close as when you were holding the ends of the string together."

The Democratic party will continue to move toward a more European-style economic policy, but probably won't make it a central part of the platform unless Europe's economy pulls out of its slowdive by then.

The Republican party will win if and only if they field a convincingly libertarian candidate. They will lose horribly if they don't.

Good! We love those, here!

&gt;But when the Federation was at war with the Klingons or Romulans, how come they just didn't pulverize them?

Several reasons:

* The Federation is largely a pacifist organization by default. Not only does the Federation avoid war at nearly all costs, but even in war is constantly looking for a peaceful solution. This means the Federation, on principle, will pull punches. The use of particularly devastating and violent tactics and weapons might be avoided because the Federation, at its core, wants to remain an ethical civilization. Even when we captured a Borg drone and had an opportunity to wipe them out, the senior staff of the Enterprise and Captain Picard, who was more wounded by the Borg than most, ended up deciding that committing an act of genocide against the greatest threat known to the Federation was wrong. 

* The other regional powers are really, really powerful. Other than the Federation, we have the Klingons, the Romulans, and the Cardassians as the main powers in the quadrant, all sharing borders with the Federation (yes, yes, there are others like the Tzenkethi, but let's not get into too big an answer). Each of those empires are expansionist conquerors, which will annex and invade other worlds and civilizations to use as surfs. This means really cheap goods and services and the theft of technology. While the Federation expands peacefully, through alliances, the others expand by taking what they want and enforcing that through fear and intimidation and violence. While these are diametrically opposed methods of growing in numbers and in strength, in the end they mean an equilibrium. 

* There are thresholds of technological development which are followed by plateaus. Warp drive is a massive threshold in technology, but following that it's generally just tweaking warp for the next few centuries before the next phase of technological development is achieved. This means that races which have had warp technology for a few hundred years are all going to generally be in about the same place, technologically. Interestingly, the Romulans and Klingons developed (or stole) warp technology before humanity developed it, which is why Starfleet found themselves at a significant technological disadvantage initially, during the NX-01 years. The Vulcans, Andorians, Tellarites, Orions, Klingons, Romulans, and a few others were spacefaring first, but by the TOS era, we were all basically the same. 

* We have no idea how many sentient individuals are in the Klingon and Romulan Empires, but we know they're militaristic. It's entirely possible they maintain massive populations in the tens of billions just like the Federation. It's also possible they're much smaller, but a larger part of the population is devoted to war, compensating for their smaller numbers. Remember that Starfleet is a scientific and exploratory organization first and foremost, and is not designed or run as a military armada except during rare times of war. Most episodes of *TOS* and *TNG* were about peaceful exploration, not about conflict. "

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1388603486.0,"Alright, a couple of issues right off the bat. How does storage work? That's a big important issue. If any annoying mage-kid could unstick the magic from anything, they *will,* and thus the magic is totally unreliable, and industrial/defense/etc. applications will be heavily guarded. How efficient is storing? What's the process of storing? Can anybody do it? Are some people better than others? How much can you store? How much will it enhance things? Will you get diminishing returns?

Can you overload yourself? What happens as you take in increasing amounts of magic?

Also, strength, swiftness, and awareness are very vague. Could you make your own muscles strong enough to break your own bones? How is swiftness any different than just making your muscles stronger and brain quicker? And wouldn't you get the same effect by stacking awareness until your brain is hyper-aware?

What does awareness mean? The human brain uses an *immense* amount of [heuristic thinking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) to simplify and streamline decision-making. Would improving your awareness make you *more* vulnerable to heuristics - like seeing patterns where there aren't any - or *less* - potentially overthinking everything, unable to make snap judgments."

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1388603545.0,"Well it has been on a couple GOTY lists (at least in the Top 10 area), but I don't think that anybody is committing a huge crime in omitting it. IMO it was a nice, well done game, I actually do think that it is highly unfair to dismiss as a QTE focused game when to me that was mainly in the opening/tutorial section. But it certainly wasn't a very deep or meaningful game (nor imo was it intended to be one, at least not to the extent that some of the other high concept titles of the year were) that changed a lot of people's lives or perceptions like some of the games that have been making the lists have, or that did anything extremely revolutionary (for example in regards to mechanics). 

Personally, I remain unconvinced that TR definitely *HAD* to be higher . [that said, dismissing any game as ""lame"" without going into why is kinda a weak way of explaining your reasoning in a professional setting  regardless of what the game is] 

I'm not really a follower of Giant Bomb, but if having too few female staff members is a problem of theirs I don't think that that necessarily can be measured by how well TR did or god forbid, Call of Duty: Ghosts (it's not like they are the only people not feeling that game, Yatzhee even put it as his number 1 worst game based on the single player story).

I've never been much of a picky eater myself, so I want to say ""suck it up"" and eat what you need to but there should be ways to make most things delicious. If you're going to do Keto, throw some bacon and cheese on it. Seasoning is important, garlic, ginger, onion, and pepper of various kinds get you far, as does a good cooking fat. Eat veggies with butter, bacon fat or coconut oil. I save fat from ground beef also, freeze it and throw it in soup later or something.

I've assumed we're talking veggies anyway. Try picking one you are OK with and try the flavouring tips above. I like to buy a bag of fresh or frozen broccoli florets (fresh is better if you can commit to finishing it before it spoils). I like the pre-cut stuff because I am unbelievably lazy. Broccoli goes great with bacon and/or cheese or in some kind of Chinese dish.

Personally, my main issue with salad is all the cutting up, so I like to buy a bag of dark greens like baby spinach and kale mix. You can throw a low carb dressing on it raw or cook in w/e oil.

But here's a tip, the big thing there is to climb to the top, stay over night at the hotel (I think just one, maybe 2)...get your feet massaged in their spa for sure!  (tons of stairs to climb to get to the top) Anyways, as I was saying,t he thing to do is to wake up early before sunrise and walk up to the very tip of top and see the sun rise.  They even lend you coats the night before because it can be freezing that high up in the early morning.  here's my tip: skip it!  The reality is about 2000 people jam this little viewing area pushing in so tight with everyone holding cell phones to capture the picture of the sunrise.  If alone, I would do it...so peaceful.  But everyone talks and chats...plus the location of the sun rise is not impressive. I was left like ""THAT'S IT?!""  BUT...the sun set near that hotel is awesome and only a fraction went over to appreciate it.  Some people there, but plenty of places to get your own spot to just sit and enjoy it.

Look at it this way. You ask him out, he says yes and you two start going out together, having fun, being a non exclusive couple, which eventually turns into an exclusive thing. Or, you don't ask him out, you let the dust settle on this thing you may or may not have, and by the time you work up the nerve to ask him out, he's found someone else because you've confused him and he's decided to move on.

Or browsing reddit and seeing someone who has a cool non-vanilla font, asking OP what the name of the font is, and MAYBE getting a reply

**TL;DR** font previews post in honour of BytaFont 2, give *Name of font* and *an image* and anything else that might be helpful

Edit: kept saying BytaFont wrong"

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1388605212.0,"&gt; Now, with baseball specifically we start to see regional variations that kind of, sort of resemble baseball being played in America in the first half of the 19th century. The Knickerbocker rules - which date to 1845 - were the dominant set of rules being played in the area of New York, but they were by no means the only set of rules. The game would be kind of recognizable to a modern observer, but rules such as making an out on a catch after one bounce would be pretty weird now. It also lacked 'balls', although three strikes was a rule.

For comparison, a competing version was [the Massachusetts Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Massachusetts_Game).  Like modern baseball but unlike the NY rules, the ball had to be caught on the fly, and pitching was overhand.  However:

* Runners were out if hit by the ball, which worked because
* The ball was much lighter
* Runners could try to avoid the throw by leaving basepaths
* The batter didn't stand at home plate
* Bases were closer
* There was one out per inning
* There was no foul territory
* There were more players per team
* The team that scored 100 runs first won

Without foul territory and with closer bases (particularly the batter being close to first), there was a lot more offense, as evidenced by the 100-runs-to-win rule.  [Here](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ruletown.shtml) are the rules to this nifty game."

Hurt my cats and you can get the fuck out forever, I don't care who you are.

Other reasons why your ex should become your ex once more:

1. You should not have been rejected for making a sexual request. I presume you weren't asking him to do anything out of the ordinary, just being specific with what you wanted in the moment? That's good and healthy and leads to awesome sex. You won't be able to grow sexually in this relationship- he clearly wants to make it all about him and what he feels like doing. Not okay.

2. Leaving is not the answer to uncovering an issue in your relationship. He put you in an awful position by asking the question. He is terrible at resolving conflict. Not something you want in a partner.

3. All this ""you always have to be right"" stuff is just so off. Basically he knows deep down that he is being unreasonable, he has no idea how to argue his case because he doesn't have one. So he just tries to make you feel bad instead. Ugh. Awful.

More likely, IMO, is that the reverse logistics of return postage, re-inspection, re-packaging, re-stocking are nearly as costly as the tablet itself. Add in the nebulous goodwill value of this favor to the consumer, and the incremental purchases, and they could come out ahead.

So the soft savings of an avoided return, plus the added sales likely make it less a money-loser than the alternative of the returned tablet.
