The major use case is people creating quick accounts to either write pos or neg reviews quickly and then never using those accounts again.  Yelp has to deal with fake accounts every second of every day.  Rival businesses pay people to create fake accounts and negatively review their competition.

shinyquagsire23,science,1390193172.0,"This. I've been swimming competitively since I was 5 so physical activity wasn't anything new. But when I got to PE I hated every moment of it because people were just plain jerks. In high school freshman year I was picked last every single time when it came to a sport, even at basketball despite being taller than just about everyone else in the class at 6"" tall. The main reason was because I was both a white guy among a class that was 90% hispanic (which means that they *always* had to pick their closer friends first, which were for the most part hispanic as well) as well as me being pretty pitiful at any other sport than swimming. It really sucked because I was a really good swimmer and even got varsity later on that year (and also got out of a second year of PE thank goodness), but I just couldn't do crap in anything else. So I didn't end up hating physical activities, I hated being in PE with a bunch of people who were being assholes instead of trying to support and improve others. I'd struggle at team sports and instead of giving constructive advise they'd just yell at me for sucking at the sport which our PE teacher hadn't even talked or explained about hardly at all. So I guess it's fair to say that I didn't hate PE as much as I hated the people *in* PE.

On the opposite end, I'm still doing competetive swimming, and from the moment I get into the water until I get out I pretty much phase out and think about what I'm going to do as soon as I get out of the water rather than actually enjoying being in the water and doing things. If I had a choice to go to swim team or to stay at home programming (which I'd much rather do), I'd pick programming 100% of the time, unless it was really hot inside the house and I could use something to cool off. So for me, what made me hate physical activity is both a bit of being forced to do it was well as being around a bunch of dirtbags that can't be supportive at all.

TLDR; Being picked on made me hate people more than making me hate physical activity. Being forced to do physical things makes me hate doing them more."

hammayolettuce,UCSD,1390193272.0,"Why not do both?

May I ask what *aspect* of economics do you find interesting? I'm interested in decision-making, so I decided to add a cog-sci minor to build on my econ electives. I'm assuming you've already looked through the econ course catalog and have seen the environmental and public economics electives. You could always do an earth science minor so that your curriculum feels more focused on your interests. Email the undergrad department to see what lower division courses they recommend for the minor, that way you can try to get some of them out of the way at community college.

For me, econ is way more math-based than lower division courses and econ books (e.g. Freakonomics) would lead you to believe. Take all of your calculus classes, differential equations and linear algebra (you don't need 20D and 20E for the major, but I highly recommend them). I also *strongly* recommend taking a stats class. I got thrown into the math 180/181 series having never taken a stats class in my life, and it was a little rough. The econ 120 series isn't quite as rigorous, but it would still be useful to know some stats going into it.

But it's too easy to get depressed and negative about this stuff. So, you weren't in a good place and you may have wasted some time. Maybe you spent a few years living in ways you're not exactly proud of. But this is now. Fight off the depression just like you're fighting off the urge to smoke. It took some time to make your life the way it is, so it's reasonable that it will take time to change it. 


You can't make instant friends and magically be a ""success"" overnight to make up for lost time, but you *can* build a better life, and have the patience to deal with occasional boredom and slow progress. You can work on making your relationship better, and see how that goes. Maybe you'll decide that it's not right for you, but whatever it is, you'll be able to deal with it a lot better with a clear head.


A lot of that is what I tell myself, it may or may not help ;) I actually really suck at making gradual changes. I get panicked, and then I run away from everything associated with whatever my problem is. This is behavior I'm not proud of and I wish I was different. But I'm really trying to change.

I think the Farseer definitely rolls on better tables than the Spiritseer but having the spirit-mark on something and then shooting a bunch of Cannons at it (this can work decently well if your opponent is bringing one pesky flyer) plus your Wraithknight (or two wraithlords in my case) being able to take advantage of it makes up for the difference. Doesn't really work with scythes so I'd almost rather have a Farseer. That being said, Spiritseer vs Farseer and dscythes vs cannons are very situational and depend on what you expect to be facing. Not a lot of hordes in my local meta but a couple Mech IG and Eldar armies so I find the cannons can be more useful.

Yeah the jetbike models suck. Dark eldar ones are moderately better and you can probably kitbash the two into a decent looking model.

I'd say that you should write a bunch of lists and playtest every option that you have available. You will a) find a list that you really like using combinations that might surprise you and b) have a lot of fun playing the game. "

In my area, ""honey"" can be freely used with women (even if you are woman, so long as you are older than the referent), but ""darling"" is reserved for an SO or for drag queens to use. For men, you can generally use ""bud"" or ""buddy"" if you're a guy. The most important thing to remember, though, is that if the addressee is older than you, you need to use ""ma'am"" and ""sir"", unless told otherwise.

The more I think about it, the more elaborate the honorifics get in my home area. Now, if you go just 50 miles north to Richmond, KY, a lot of what I've said no longer holds. So, it really only holds in a 45 mile radius of Jackson County, KY.

Or that A Jewish guy in London made the whole thing up http://www.bagpipehistory.info/ireland.shtml, which is also funny, because corned beef and cabbage is a cheap Jewish food, which their poor Irish neighbors bought to celebrate St. Patrick's Day in the late/mid 1800s, and now some of Irish Americans think it is an Irish food!

These guys proudly proclaim that the quality of American beers is so great that the rest of the world is shit, because they can't get ahold of the best beers from elsewhere, but in typical American style they translate this to ""everywhere must have shit beer compared to Murica because I've never seen them, so Murica must be the best.""

&gt;shoryukenist 2 points 20 hours ago

&gt;I'm sorry, this point is wrong. If you go to any supermarket, and most gas stations, you can find a large selection of Belgian and Germans beers. We like European beers as well

Now let me explain for you, I said we had a large selection of Belgian and German beers, that is all.  Did I say we have every single brewery in Germany and Belgium?  If a grocery store has 8 brands from Belgium, and 10 from Germany, I'd consider that a fairly large selection to choose from.  It isn't like there is 1 beer from each country.  And that is why I did not mention UK or Irish beers, because you would be limited to Fullers, Samuel Smith and Guinness. 

You aren't even trying to read.  

EDIT:  Unless you are saying we only import the worst beers from Belgium and Germany, I'd love to hear an explanation on that.

TheeLinker,AskReddit,1390194856.0,"I noticed this as well, and I think it's just because stories are told differently on television than they are in books or movies.

In a long-running story-based television season (like LOST), the climax comes in the last episode, and the big *thing* often comes at the very end. Something amazingly exciting happens that's been built up to for the previous 12/25/whatever episodes, and we usually have to wait until the next season begins to see just how that event affected the characters and the setting and what this new development means.

In a book or movie... admittedly, I haven't read a whole *lot* of literature (and I haven't read the GoT series, either), but climaxes don't come at the *very* end of a movie and I don't think they do for books either, generally? It takes the last five to ten minutes/one or two chapters to settle the characters, downplay the action, and set things in motion for the next installment. Everything about the big *thing*, specifically, is resolved, so that the next book or movie can start with something new. Books and movies don't generally start *fast*, to the best of my knowledge; they start off quiet, to allow readers to settle into the setting before things explode. Or, they might, but not with anything that's a game-changer for the plot, usually (say, some sort of battle that serves as an example of a typical day in their life).

Since Game of Thrones is based off a book series, it needs to devote an episode to everything that came at the end of whatever book it's rendering on screen. ASoIaF book 2 doesn't start with [Joffery ordering his men to hunt down the remaining Starks and their allies as a follow-up to the big startling beheading](/spoiler), as a typical television series probably would have done -- because it wants to join the characters as they recover and journey into the next chapter of their lives, not in the middle of their chapter. Television series can be viewed as one big long story, but books and movies are more often distinct chunks.

That's my theory, anyway. I might be talking out my ass (indeed, I almost certainly am). I just noticed exactly what you had observed and found it interesting enough to try and figure out."

Willravel,SRSFeminism,1390195555.0,"Like I said above, I've not seen this. While I'm certainly open to the possibility this is simply something I've missed, as I'm relatively new to I guess what you could call active feminism, there's also the fact that this kind of interpretation of sex-positive feminism is a clear violation of core principles of feminist theory, which is why I'm left scratching my head. How can something be sex-positive feminism if it's not feminism? It's like vegan meatloaf. 

That's why I had the response I had to the article. Sex-positive feminism, at least the sex-positive feminism I've read about in academia and discussed in feminist circles, is every bit feminist first and foremost. It's about the core ideas of feminism, about how inequitable and unjust structures of gender inequality and oppression exist (along with other, intersecting structures), and that as people who recognize these structures we have a responsibility to actively dismantle them. Sex-positivite feminism is about understanding that healthy sexuality can exist in a context of recognizing, rejecting, and dismantling said structures. Just because society has rigid gender roles for us to fit into, just because we're living under structures of privilege and oppression, doesn't mean sex can't be part of a better way of living and seeing the world now, or a better future. Saying that rape fetishism never has anything at all to do with, say, rape culture and calling that viewpoint sex-positive is, frankly, incorrect. 

The article and I largely agree, I think the only real difference is that there's a feeling I get from the article that these things are sex-positive feminism taken too far, whereas I see it more as a misunderstanding of sex-positive feminism, and using the label incorrectly. I believe healthy sexuality has a place in a more ideal world in which structures of oppression have been dismantled. I do not, however, believe in absolute sexual liberty beyond skeptical questioning or above all reproach. "

igacek,depression,1390195583.0,"Wow, I appreciate the post. I think my interest in travel goes hand-in-hand with my situation of, as you put, being stuck inside the same 4 walls day in and day out. There's so much of this world to see, but I'm in the same room day after day, which is why I want to branch out. No place in particular, but just the act of traveling intrigues me. I was thinking to ease the sadness, maybe the next time I have two days off, to just buy a plane ticket somewhere and wing it overnight, just to get out. Would that be a good idea, or possibly a recipe for destruction?

I am currently studying business and economics, but would like to major in Business Technology. I need to work full time for bills and leisure money, and any less would be stressful (as odd as that sounds). No shyness here, I actually consider myself quite outgoing and love to have fun, but I feel like I'm stuck in the same damn social group that's set in it's ways, and it's *extremely* hard to meet new people in my city, especially at my age. Maybe that's just an excuse though, I'm not sure.

I do like your suggestion of simply sitting with a drink (coffee, tea, what have you) and looking out the window. I guess that's why I enjoy going to coffee shops though. I don't really have a purpose there since I'm on my computer just running over my bills or listening to music, but it's a change of scenery and I like to people watch, as it makes me feel like I'm not stuck in the same 4 walls, and that I may have a purpose. Maybe I should modify that a bit and not take my computer next time - maybe just my phone for some light music and drink my coffee. Would that be a good idea?

I like the idea of writing down my ideas and thoughts. I tried that once and it was interesting in a good and bad way (likely because I wasn't used to it). I may have to give that another go. 

It sounds like you think I should make some big changes in life and alter my path a bit. Move out of my parents place and live on my own (again) for a while. That would put me in a new setting and possibly disrupt my same-4-walls-every-day chain, yes?"

That being said just because she got pregnant doesn't mean she is entirely stupid it just means she made a really stupid mistake.   One of my friends had a kid at 20 while in college and still managed to graduate. She has been raising the kid really well and has a full career path setup for herself while being a single mother. While it does make things more difficult and you do miss out on a lot of the traditional young flexibility I wouldn't say that having a kid at a young age is a guaranteed nail in the life enjoyment coffin. There are many people who actually find that the kid will redefine their lives for the better because it puts things in perspective.

hallflukai,mildlyinfuriating,1390195983.0,"I'm going to do a few things to address your post because I really think you misunderstand the thought process of an artist.

Where I really take issue with your comment is where you say it seems like a lazy way out.

Art in general isn't just the technical ability to paint something that looks real. Maybe it used to be that way, but it moved beyond that quite awhile ago. Is Van Gogh's [Starry Night](http://uploads2.wikipaintings.org/images/vincent-van-gogh/the-starry-night-1889(1).jpg) just a lazy way out because Van Gogh couldn't paint a ""true masterpiece""? Of course not! It accomplishes something completely different than if he were to paint a very realistic night. Think of the modern/contemporary movement as an extension of that idea. You don't have to understand it, but don't write off the artists that pursue that avenue of expression as ""lazy"" or out of the league of older painters. It's not that they're in different leagues, they're basically playing completely different sports at this point.

If you're looking for artists today that make paintings like that you might like [this](http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/19-amazing-paintings-not).

Jesus christ, fucking krav maga and their fucking knife defenses. Most people who train never got into a real fight. They think they are above all else and shit. Yes, there's certain stuff you can do against a guy with a knife, but they are not even close to 50% chance to live, i'd venture a guess and not even close to a 25%. You just need smart and quick reflexes, wrist control and distance with good footwork and knockout power, but still, me, a guy who likes to pick fights against multiple opponents and find it FUN to fight 3 guys at once and trains 4 to 6 hours a day, i wouldn't dare fight again against a guy with a knife.

People need to get in real fights and then start their training to see what the fuck it really is about.

Krav maga and all those shitty knife defenses doesnt work. The best shot is to rather kick him super retardedly fast and hard so he cant keep up with your running speed, or knock him out before he knifes you, and ofc if he's on the ground and tried to knife you, you pee in his fucking mouth, rob him, and break a few bones."

I ended up using a brand called Raw which is sold at Hot Topic.  After 3 washes, I can start to see the fading so I'm not super thrilled with it either...but it IS technically a semi perm color.  So I'm going to shop around some more.  I posted my photos here: http://imgur.com/a/LwvdJ  

With your color, you're not going to get the color that is on the box unless you bleach it out lighter.  Like the other poster said...you'll probably end up with a teal color after a single wash.

So what I would do is approach both of them at the same time. Just mention you'd be interested in something, or flirt with the partner in front of the friend, and then give them time to discuss it without you, and then they can decide who tells you whether it's fine or not.

I'd personally feel really disrespected if a friend of my husband approached him first to date me, but he might feel betrayed if they didn't. So that's the compromise I would come up with.

You don't need to address both at once as long as they're both there. So whether you flirt with the partner, or tell the friend ""your partner is quite a catch."" in front of the partner. That kind of thing. Then it's obvious you're not trying to do anything behind either or their backs.

If you know more about how their relationship works, then you adapt to that, but I assume if you did, you wouldn't be asking the question in the first place."

It's a safe space for those who need it, but there's plenty of people posting just to laugh at them. And I do think they are compatible. Laughing is a good way to deal with harassment. It would really derail the sub if every thread discusses the validity of the 'creep'-label. And that is actually what happens when you allow it.

Jeikuu,AskMen,1390197111.0,"&gt; I am not sensitive or vulnerable.

I don't like to be around people that are overly vulnerable, nor someone who is especially sensitive. It leaves too much open to problems.

&gt; I don't gossip.

This is a good thing.

&gt; I am completely out of touch with my emotions. 

This is bad regardless of being a man or woman. I'm not saying anyone, regardless of gender, should be some touchy feely mushy type of person but you should know how you feel, what you want and how to go about getting it.

&gt;I am not nurturing or gentle.

You don't have to be all the time, but try to be when it's called for. Don't dismiss it as it just being how you are.

&gt;extremely competitive

Could be problematic depending on how competitive you get with your partner, how far you and he take it, and how you and he both handle it.

&gt;independent, practical and objective.

These shouldn't even be subject to question, I personally consider these positive traits in just about anyone. Just don't let pride mix with your independence to the point of  being a fault. If someone is just trying to help you out with little things or do something nice for you, odds are it is not with any sort of motive to undermine your independence.

&gt; I lift heavy.

Will vary entirely based on the guy. Personally I prefer an active gal, whether it be running, sports, lifting or whatever else. It means (to me) they're more likely to care about their health and themselves which is another positive trait. Realize that some guys will not like too much muscle on a woman, though. I don't find overly muscular women attractive, but good tone and a bit of strength/visible muscle is nothing to fret over."

Reddit_SuckLeperCock,AskWomen,1390197137.0,"Is he depressed as well as introverted? If he is, you may find that he's trying to spare your feelings. Bare with me here - but I've done this exact thing myself, trying to 'keep up appearances' with my SO so she doesn't worry about me. My rationale at the time was that I was too down or exhausted to hang out with friends, but I'd tell my SO that I was when in reality I was on the couch drinking beer and watching movies. So in her eyes I wasn't too depressed where she'd worry about me (because apparently I was still out with friends enjoying myself), and I felt better knowing she wasn't worried. So I was trying to make her feel better by telling lies, even though it's a roundabout way and not really moral thing to do. 

Edit - If he's depressed then in my opinion (as someone who's done this), I'm taking a guess to say he really cares about you, because he doesn't want to create unnecessary stress for the one he cares about. In a situation where depression is an issue (especially males), you'll do anything not to harm the ones you love while trying to keep up 'appearances' as a normal person, and at the same time trying to deal with the sickness yourself."

That's why I stuck with it for so long, thinking maybe once I got used to it it would feel better than before, but unless that takes years, it doesn't look like it's going to happen.

I'm fairly confident the placement is good because I researched it for over a year before I had it done, and picked a piercer who had been recommended a lot.

It can't be separated from feminism any more than any other subgroup of feminism like anarchist feminists or environmental feminists. They're all feminist. Because of that, they necessarily include core feminist concepts. 

In other words, if you defend racial fetishization because it's a form of sexual expression and no sexual expression should ever be met with critique or criticism, you're not sex-positive. You're something else, perhaps sexual anarchist or something. You're not simply taking sex-positive feminism too far, because that's decidedly not a feminist viewpoint.

The lack of a true market has tied [59% of the country to barely caring about the costs of their healthcare because they get it from their employment](http://www.rwjf.org/en/about-rwjf/newsroom/newsroom-content/2013/04/number-of-americans-obtaining-health-insurance-through-an-employ.html) and apparently another [21% or something gets it from medicaid](http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-enrollment-as-a-of-pop/) and possibly [16% on medicare](http://kff.org/medicare/state-indicator/medicare-beneficiaries-as-of-total-pop/) probably with some overlap. This means that the remaining few individuals buying healthcare on their own are fighting the rising costs of people with far deeper pockets and more willingness to dump money at a program. If we fixed this problem we would still probably have a higher cost than the rest of the world because it is kind of hard to beat a single monopoly group forcing lower prices but it would bring us a hell of a lot closer than we are right now. 

Edit: Now I am somewhat libertarian at heart so my personal preference would be that we pay a tiny bit more for a free market solution and lose some of the economics of scale that a monopoly would provide. To me it is kind of like asking for the US government to make a single food manufacturer because the economics of scale would make it far cheaper to give out single payer food choices than pay for millions of grocery stores and millions of different forms of food.

I was told this by some biology teachers in high school and I admit I even skewed it in my head for a while. I think up until a week ago I thought they managed to do it with humans and the baby grew up okay.

Probably the people on tumblr are having the same issue. Didn't pay enough attention when it was being taught, only heard half the words.

&gt; **No Need for Men**~~?~~

&gt; ~~Could~~ Kono's results ~~be used to~~ render men obsolete~~?~~

&gt; ""Imprinting is pretty ~~complicated~~,"" said Randy Jirtle, a geneticist specializing in imprinting at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. ~~Genes can be imprinted in some tissues but not others. It can also vary from species to species.~~

&gt; There are about 80 to 90 known imprinted genes in mice. Those involved in cognitive processes or nurturing behavior ~~may not~~ have been properly imprinted in Kaguya. ~~These effects may not be obvious just from studying this one mouse.~~

&gt; ""**There is no doubt that this result is amazing**,"" Jirtle added. ~~""But just because this mouse is walking around on the Earth does not mean that the animal is normal.""~~

&gt; What's more, there is ~~no~~ guarantee that what worked in mice will work in humans.

&gt; Producing a mouse from two eggs is a very ~~risky and very in~~efficient procedure—~~only~~ two embryos survived of 371 that were implanted in surrogate mothers.

&gt; ~~""The success rate is less than 1 percent—who knows what went wrong with the other 99 percent,""~~ Lam said. ""Like cloning, it would be completely ~~un~~ethical to try such experiments in humans.""

&gt; ~~Until the role of imprinted genes—many of which have been implicated in disease—is better understood, it is safe to say that Dad is still an essential part of reproduction.~~

A rich person is likely to lose a lot more when he gets locked up. like losing his job etc. 
While the poor ones feel way less impact from jailtime.
So does that mean that poor people are getting less deterred from committing crimes then the rich people. so should they have increased sentences?

Devils advocate: Should working people pay less expensive fines compared to those on welfare. Working people contribute to society after all, I would doubt those on welfare do that as much. Should rich people who contribute to society by taxes more be given diminished fines because they are contributing to society more (by paying higher taxes?)

It didn't backfire. The problem is that the Wii U is not a casual console anymore and doesn't properly advertise itself as one either. 

Every family I know has a Wii. And only a Wii (it's europe, aka PC land, only college boys have consoles). All of them would like a new one but all of them kinda sense that the Wii U is not that (they might not be tech savy people, but they are smart enough to get that). Because it has a different focus or at least the advertising makes it feel that way. =&gt; these are all people who bought the Wii precisely because of all the ads of happy, mixed age families jumping around in their living room in front of the Wii, playing together. That's the vision they bought into and the Wii U no longer signals that it can or wants to deliver that.  It's stuck into trying to appeal to both a more ""hardcore""-ish crowd will still trying to be casual and that is killing it, because that message puts off both target audiences.

To put it simply, your girlfriend produces fluids from her cervix and vagina. She also most likely has a menstrual cycle, with ovulation and periods. Over her cycle, the discharge will range from very thin and see-through, to looking like egg-white, to looking thick, creamy and white, to even brownish before her period.

It's all normal and nothing to worry about, it's just natural variation over her cycle, of her body getting ready to get pregnant, then getting rid of everything it didn't need when she turns out not to be pregnant.

I hate how kids think it's cool not to do their work. I had a kid who was the typical disruptive asshole. He was a bright student, but I guess he had to keep up his reputation of being a bad kid.

One day, I held him for an hour and a half afterschool for being an asshat in class. For the first half of his informal detention, he wiped down my tables, washed my dishes (I was a science teacher), cleaned the white board, and helped me put stuff away. For the second half, I'd have him pull up a chair and do his homework for 45 minutes, or until the late buses arrived. If he had any questions about anything (science, math, history, or otherwise), I would be there to help him out. 

After two days of this, he realized that he really enjoyed staying afterschool and doing his homework in my classroom. I ended up letting him stay in my classroom afterschool for the rest of that semester if he so desired. He ended up waiting until everyone left the class and when no one was looking, he'd then come back into my classroom to sit down and begin his work.

Here's the twist: Every now and then, he'd feel the need to act out and be a jackass in class again. I'd punish him by not allowing him to come in after school that day."
StarHeadedCrab,changemyview,1390199567.0,"&gt; Being a charlatan or a thief necessitates stealing other people's property. Being a sex worker does not

A person's money is their property, and getting it through illegitimate means is stealing it.

&gt; Why is the prostitute miserable if she enjoys sex less than the client? I can enjoy sex but my partner enjoys it more. More importantly, why is it exploitative if somebody enjoys sex more than somebody else? By that logic, my girlfriend shouldn't give me a blowjob because I enjoy it more than her. Why is the monetary worth of the sex dependent on the enjoyment of the prostitute? If John pays the prostitute $100 and she has the best sex of her life but he has the second best sex of his life, why is he being exploited?

This isn't about the ""quality"" of sex. This is about whether it's a mutually consensual and enjoyable thing. I think there's something quite wrong whether the prostitute can say ""I wouldn't have done that if he didn't pay me"" (because it's putting someone through an experience that they're not enjoying just for a financial reward), and something wrong with ""I would do that regardless of pay or not"".

Maldevinine,australia,1390199908.0,"I think much of Australia puts too much emphasis on owning their own home, and it being an investment that should earn them money.

If owning a home earns you money, something's wrong with the economy. It fulfills a constant need, that of shelter, and does not increase the amount of shelter it provides as time goes on. For it to increase in value, the shelter it provides must be increasing in value. But it's not increasing the amount of shelter, so that means that shelter as a general commodity must be increasing in value. For it to be increasing in value, it must be becoming rarer. For that to happen the economy must not be producing enough shelter to meet demand.

Therefore this article points to an underlying flaw in the mindset of the people who are complaining about the tower. Ok, it's not really their fault. I've only read one economist that actually looked at how these things should work, and even he was too focused on the movement of money, when the money within the system is simply a way of keeping track."

LolaRuns,Games,1390199964.0,"&gt;They have a console that suits their casual gaming needs and still works for party games, etc.

Except that concept falls through when no more new games come out for their console. =&gt; families still need at least enough game influx to have a new one every Christmas and birthday. And even if they are not hardcore savy they are still smart enough to notice eventually that their games fall behind too much between what else is out. Most people I know who own a Wii are totally at the point where they would buy a new one, but they don't buy a Wii U because to them the Wii U doesn't communicate that it will be more of the same only better. Since none of their big name titles fit into the ""happy fun time/family in front of the tv being ""active"" together"" category that these people are looking for, they don't get what is supposed to be better about the WiiU, all it seems to do is offer features that they have no interest in and less focus on the features they do want. 

Tablets and such are not a replacement because they don't have motion controls and the local multiplayer. 

I think the market would totally be up for a new casual console, it's just that casual gamers don't buy that the WiiU is one. And it really isn't (like this article imo reasonably argued, starting with the controller). It's not optimized for casual audiences and casual advertising because it's vainly trying to appeal to both rather than creating an experience all around casual play. "

You don't need to buy Alpinestars/Dainese everything nor a Shoei/Arai helmet for your first gear. I spent a little under $300 on a [DOT/Snell M2010 helmet](http://www.jafrum.com/Shop-By-Brand/HJC-CL-16-Helmets/HJC-CL-16-Machine-Helmet), [Icon leather gloves](http://www.jafrum.com/Shop-By-Brand/Mens-Icon-Gloves/Icon-Gloves-Mens-Icon-Justice-Leather-Glove), [Fly Racing jacket](http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/fly-8th-street-jacket) and [Detour pants](http://www.jafrum.com/Shop-By-Brand/Detour/Detour-8504-Mesh-Motorcycle-pants-with-CE-Armor?gdftrk=gdfV25976_a_7c2444_a_7c9150_a_7cDetour8504&amp;gclid=CMaRxaKSjLwCFcFj7AodXggAqQ), and a protective cover. Obviously I'm not experiencing Shoei comfort with my HJC CL-16 but for $70 with Snell M2010 and DOT certification it's the best bang for buck by a long shot. My $80 (on sale) jacket probably won't protect like a $600 Dainese jacket, but I spent less on all my gear than the price of the Shoei RF1100 on sale, and I'm pretty sure my gear protects me better than a single Shoei helmet would.

Now I bought everything on sale, and had to return my first helmet that was too small but that only cost me $7. With $500 I'm sure you can be almost as well protected as with $1000, if not equally protected. Not as comfortable/stylish, but someone who's thinking about taking out a loan for a bike doesn't sound like someone who has that kind of money to spend.

Also, since my bike cost me only $1200 I wasn't about to bump that up a grand just for gear."

Dragons are big. Square-cube law, trophic levels, etc. They're gonna need to eat a whole lot and almost certainly refuel.

&gt;  First,

If your dragon is a product of evolution, it's unlikely that it can carry lots of crap. Flying is energy-intensive and wings are precisely balanced with the body. Even large birds don't carry large things large distances. You'd need some biological explanation for draconic strength to be able to carry more than, you know, two or three hundred pounds. Laser weaponry tends to be quite heavy.

bigtcm,AskReddit,1390201682.0,"Experimental drug testing on humans, especially illicit drugs. Hear me out.

At the moment, a ton of basic and translational research is needed that has to back up that this drug will theoretically work (the drug binds to its target or it impedes viral replication, or kills cancer cells, or whatever that drug's intended effect is). This may take a few years. I have no problem with this step. The next steps however, drive me nuts.

If a drug candidate is discovered, and it passes that first step, it then has to undergo years of preclinical trials - the drug is tested on animal models - either mice, or rats, or rabbits, or monkeys or whatever. If it's deemed safe for animals, then it's sent for clinical trials in patients. For another couple years or so. If it's proven safe in the clinical trials, it's then released to the market...literally 10 to 15 years after that first drug was made in the basic science step.

Problem One: Mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys aren't human. There's a good chance that whatever drug works in these lab animals won't work in humans. That's a waste of several years of time and several tens of millions of dollars. 

Problem Two: Since marijuana, cocaine, and other ""hard drugs"" are deemed illegal by the federal government, research of those drugs is insanely hard to get approved. There's some research suggesting that THC can help treat cancer. However, that research will never get approved because marijuana's a Schedule One drug.

Problem Three: It takes a long time and a lot of money to get a drug approved in our current model. If a drug gets approved, it literally costs billions of dollars to get through those 10 years of preclinical and clinical trials, which is one of the reason why drug costs are so high. If we can get rid of the preclinical step and go straight to human testing, it would save a ton of money and time. We can have a faster turnaround from discovering a new drug to distributing it to the public and curing/treating diseases."

Maldevinine,Fantasy,1390201784.0,"Greetings Mr Cole. I'm Maldevinine and I've been around here for about a year.

I read excessively and focus on the strangest works that I can find. Most of my contribution to the site is in the book recommendation threads and the monthly ""what have you read"" threads. I make a point of not commenting unless I can find at least 3 books and I can explain why they are good, and why they fit the request. When I answer in /r/booksuggestions, the thread tends to stay answered. I will admit to focusing more on authors from my native Australia when answering, but that is not because of any backroom advertising deals. Yet.

I also happily join in with debates on classifications and organisation of the stories as trying to describe the stories is much of what I enjoy about reading them. Trying to find the borders that work for me between dark and grimdark, or heroic and epic and then trying to find works that defy my classifications is something I find fun. By doing this as part of the /r/fantasy community I get to use the reading lists of nearly 50,000 other people and their experiences as well. I like to think that the time I spend thinking about this helps others understand what they like about particular stories and find more stories that they enjoy. Probably just kidding myself there.

Away from the internet I have been making plans for an Australian equivalent to the ""Drinks with Authors"" event that you helped organise. I must admit that the strength of the response to the event has intimidated me, it certainly set a high standard and the Australian writing community does not seem to have the same level of community spirit. Plans for that and for running an /r/fantasy booth at some of our conventions are on hold while I am looking for a new job, because rosters can be very troublesome in my industry.

Lastly, I am going to be buying a copy of your book anyway, because it's a good story, and is something that I have not seen done before."

Perhaps professional dominatrixes are ok? They're doing something completely different to the other person, require skill, and BDSM is perfectly natural (eg you're not mentally ill for wanting BDSM sex)?

Now what if first grade you suddenly realized that bacon used to be this cute little pig that you just learned about? If we eat pigs and cows, what's stopping us from eating other animals we learned about in the first grade like dogs and cats? 

2. Raising meat for food is resource intensive. It takes much less resources to grow food for eating. Growing crops to feed animals for slaughter is not an efficient use of arable land and water, especially if both are in short supply. 

3. I don't know if this argument could be made in the past, but we can survive just fine without eating meat. In ancient prehistory when calories and nutrition were limited and scarce, meat was a big deal. In this day and age, we can get our sustenance without meat."

2. Which brings me to, which side should the chaise be on if I do go for a sectional?
3. Would white/black/glass coffee tables go best with this?
4. I don’t know how I am going to reorganize my living room. Basically the tv has to stay where it is, but I can mount it above the fireplace. The dog cage and the treadmill can definitely come out and go in the spare room, it looks pretty tacky as is. 
5. I’d like to paint the shelf as it is a very bleh colour, would black or white work best?
6. I will need an area rug/artwork/new lamps eventually, but for now I’d like to get the basics first
7. What about the wall colour? Will it look okay with the grey furniture or should I go for something else? I want it to look contemporary, yet warm at the same time. My dog took a good chunk out of two of the wall corners already, so it definitely does need painting.

bigtcm,changemyview,1390206175.0,"&gt; I wasn't five years old. I was 14+ and very capable of learning about nutrition and making my own choices, including not drinking soda.

I'll put this simply: 14 year olds are not exactly known for making the best decisions. 

There's a reason why young people who commit crimes aren't always charged as adults. The reasoning is that a teenager's brain's completely fucked and they don't know what they're doing. You could sort of apply the same argument to having a soda machine on a high school. Kids may know that drinking that much soda is bad for them, but they'll still make the terrible choice to drink it. As a society, it's the responsible choice to keep something that can potentially be abused (soda and junk food) away from 14 year olds whose brains aren't yet fully developed."

I used to be very anxious around people too, and I thought alcohol made that better. It turned out that alcohol was the cause of my anxiety and depression. After a few months I have stabilized to a great degree. I have a much easier time relaxing and being myself without alcohol now, and it's genuine. So not only can I relax, but I don't have to get blasted and idiotic to get there.

You see, anxiety and depression are typical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Especially the sort of acute withdrawal that we keep ourselves in when we drink heavily frequently.

MazDatsun,videos,1390211312.0,"Rally pace notes are very simple and generally very intuitive, most of the ""words"" used are descriptions or warnings of things to avoid or note. Each driver and Co-driver have their own special words or notations for certain things but here are a few from this video.

The numbers given are either a description of the turns, or distance.
1-5 (6 in this case) are a description of an upcoming turn. 5 meaning nearly straight and successively getting sharper until you get to 1 which is a little more than a hairpin. However in some cases, the scale is swapped completely so 5 being a near 90° and 1 being almost straight.

""5 right +"" would be a 5 (gentle right) and + means it opens, - would be tightens

40, 100, 120, etc. is distance to give the driver an idea of the distance he will cover between turns or the next notation, generally only used to mark straight line distances. 

Kick, I'm not quite sure about but I believe it's an aggressive bump but not quite a full on jump.

Crest, is exactly how it sounds, cresting a hill or elevation change.

Jump, again exactly as it sounds.

Tricky, telling the driver it'll be a little tricky.

With dying, just have one player fall unconscious, and the only way to wake up is if the other player goes up to him and 'wakes him up' or something. If both fall unconscious, they both die, and you load the last save. Easy peasy.

EDIT: with conversations, just go with a SWTOR style: when talking to someone, you and your friend choose a dialogue option, but only one of you speaks.

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390214253.0,"&gt;For me, it's the implicit denial that this is sexualized content.

Who is denying that? It's the internet of course it exists. The question is why is sexualized content ""attention whoring"" in any way that various non-sexual streaming activities such intentionally acting like an idiot/over the top aren't or if they aren't all view whoring to the best of their capabilities. (not to mention that the streamer that gets talked about here seems to have a lot of other things going for her, namely a potentially intentionally abrasive personality =&gt; there are a lot of girls who try out streaming, most don't even get 30 views and give it up rather quickly; so what is it about her that makes her capable of being that much more successful? Is she really morally worse than them, or is it just morally more horrifying that she is actually successfull with it, aka would you still care about her if she got only 30 views? But if you wouldn't care then, is it really her behavior that is evil or is it her success that is evil?)

She provides shallow gaming content, just like pewdiepie and various other streamers/youtubers who have a stick. Obviously there's a market for shallow gaming content. 

To me complaining about her is like complaining that pop stars who are bad singers and don't write their own music get succcessfull. Sure that sucks, but that's how the world works. 

Hanging out in her stream and insulting her is like paying money for T-Pain concert tickets, driving there only to yell that autotune is bad. Yes it's bad, but you just gave this guy your valuable money and spent your valuable time on going to his concert even though you hate him, when you could have spent that time and money going to a concert you actually like. (and for most people, even if the agree that autotune is bad, they still feel that heckling somebody is the worse/more abrasive crime)

Yeah, Lady Gaga and Madonna are pretty bad singers, but aren't the people who rage about them existing even more annoying? How would I look if I complained that I don't get as many upvotes as some /r/gonewild chick? (I say: well, cheer to you!) You can't force the entire world to like classical opera and you can't force entire world to love quality gaming content either and you can't properly draw lines on what people are allowed or not allowed to do without going into weird ""everybody must wear burkas!!!"" or ""well you can do that, but you must have honorable intentions!!!!"" territory. 

When in reality, is that you must just wait and hope those things sort themselves out eventually, by people eventually losing interest or the people who put on an over the top act crashing and burning because they can't keep it up permanently (or alternatively: accepting that there is some sort of functioning demand/supply relationship there). 

The ability to not care about things that are not actually important is a surpringly useful skill in real life. 

_____________

IMO in reality there's plenty of shallow things being in effect in what streamers get popular. Ever noticed how male guys who are conventionally attractive (like Ghostrobo or even pewdiepiew) are much more likely to do facecam compared to guys who look more dumpy? And that despite the fact that their target audience is predominantly male and straight. Or take me for example, I'm female straight and while I really like other women and want to support them, I'll be so frank to admit that I'm subscribed to very few of them because I enjoy listening to male voices because to me they sound pretty =&gt; I also listen to way more male singers than female singers for the same reason. Or how do you know that while on a lower level boobs might be an advantage there's probably plenty of people who would be less likely to be watch a serious female streamer because they just assume she can't be that good (and imo that would exist regardless of whether kacywhatshername existed or not). There are upsides and downsides to everything. Just having boobs isn't an auto-success button and it's just as possible that some levels are closed to it. And there is plenty of ways for guys to reach high levels even without exceptional skill namely by having skills in the pewdiewpie ""acting like an idiot"" area. "

I dunno how to put it, in good faith. The link posted comes up as just a jpg for me, it doesn't go to the imgur album with descriptions. I also noticed her first comment with the product list was later edited to add the name of the model. Sure, she doesn't *have* to expressly state in the title that it's a model or inspiration pic, and there are no reddit laws here being breached or anything, but the result is a lot of people assumed wrongly that the picture was of OP. And I think it's a reasonable assumption that people would take it at face value and not look for all the fine print / every single post for a mention otherwise.

And maybe it was a genuine error the OP didn't realise it would be taken that way. The way she's responded and addressed the people who brought it to public attention has been very defensive -- and sure, she's entitled to be. But if I'd made a genuine error I'd give a response like 'sorry for the confusion blah blah' instead of trying to slag other users with some bizarre analogy. But that's me. I can see how you might view it that OP has been wronged, but it seems to be a minority perspective.

For me personally, the sticking point is still the bogus product list. People have commented on it, politely, as you suggested. OP hasn't responded."

keypuncher,Republican,1390216877.0,"&gt; If I read the rulings, they are unconstitutional because of 14th.

That is what the activist judges have ruled, yes.

The specific part of the 14th they say it violates is Section 1, which reads:

&gt; Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

Now the problem with this is that their reading of the 14th treats homosexuals as having additional rights that no one else has, in order to say that prohibitions against same-sex marriages violate the equal protection clause.

Prior to those rulings, a homosexual man had every right to marry exactly the same people that a heterosexual man did - likewise for homosexual women and hetero women.

The rulings create a *new* right: to marry someone of the same gender.

&gt; When you consider 10th, also consider the supremacy clause of the constitution.

I do consider it - but reading things into the Constitution that are not there does not trump the 10th.

LizzieDane,AskWomen,1390217227.0,"Eight products! 

To elaborate I double cleanse, use two actives with a 5 minute wait between each, toner, moisturiser, vaseline (shower) and another moisturiser. Every time I bring it up people are like DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS NECESSARY and.. yes. For me, and my needs.

Double cleansing with two super mild cleansers (one oil, one cream) gets my makeup off *and* cleans my face while being gentle to my sensitive skin. BHA wipes exorcise any SF/zit demons. AHA serum helps with redness, anti-aging, PIH, and moisture retention. Follow that up with a gel moisturiser (Tony Moly Red Appletox, total HG moisturiser, love it), and we should be done. Except if I do it after a shower something *will* get in my hair. If I do it before a shower, those dry me out. So I do it before a shower, lock it in with vaseline (most of which comes off in the shower, it doesn't go all gross and gunky and the rest dabs off on a towel no problem), and then finish with a super light moisturiser just to be sure the water doesn't shrivel me up.

I have sensitive skin that likes to react badly to everything, so finding one product to do three of these jobs is.. unlikely. I've also got dehydrated acne prone skin when I don't do this, but with this routine it looks great. Tiny pores, soft as hell, even tone."

&gt;
&gt; 2) White people from US/Europe who don't mind the racial insensitivity because it doesn't negatively affect them, because they do not connect racial insensitivity towards them with racism towards them.

You literally must first talk, and after that you're on your own to figure out the best course of action because it'll be different every time and there's no formula. 

A single conversation or word won't cut it, no. But no one is saying it does. Just that it's the only way to begin and that there's no generalised guide past that - there can't be.

Basilgate,WritingPrompts,1390219868.0,"Jesse took a swig of water from his old, battered tin flask, never taking his eyes off Samuel Henderson. They stood out on the dusty road, a few feet apart, with the sun beating at their red raw necks. Some folk had stayed to watch. Most had run indoors, a couple of God-fearing types even covering their ears as they went. Jesse wanted to wipe the sweat off his brow, Christ it was hot, but he dared not show weakness.

Henderson took off his dark, broad-brimmed hat for a moment to slick back his silver hair, and then put it back on with a flourish. Jesse stroked his messy beard. Henderson was no slouch; even in the piss-bucket little towns around this one, his name was known and respected. There wasn’t a poetry jam for miles Henderson hadn’t been a part of. Jesse, though. Jesse was just a drifter.

“Time to put your money where your mouth is, stranger,” said Henderson, with clear and precise diction through his frontier drawl. 

Jesse found himself fingering the frayed pocket dictionary that was holstered at his hip. An old habit.

“Let’s just get this over with,” he growled, planting his feet.

The dusty old town was silent, but for a dry wind, and the creaking of the saloon sign. The two men stood, facing each other, as still as death.

Henderson fired first, whipping out his arm and pointing a mocking finger.

“You’re a smelly girl.”

Damn, he was quick. Jesse stumbled, but kept his feet. He had to focus.

“Yeah, well, everyone who ever loved you was wrong.”

“You’re a poop-head.”

“Pus- taster.”

“Your mum is quite fat.”

“*You’re* fat.”

Jesse could see Henderson try to hide a scowl. Still, he couldn’t get complacent.

“Shut up you-”

“-nasty pants.”

“Booger eating-

“-fuck face.”

“Skirt wearing-”

“-bum licker.”

The shots continued to fire, wildly, from both directions, neither man giving ground. Neither man relenting. They paced around each other, drenched with sweat. Their voices growing hoarse as the battle wore on, yet always loud and full of vitriol. The vicious sun was growing heavy in the sky when Henderson, panting loudly, stepped forward and shouted, his face red and his veins bulging.

“*You suck butter out of your mother’s ass, you inbred cinaedus!*”

Jesse reeled, falling to one knee. Gasps could be heard from the few onlookers who hadn’t run away in shock and disgust. *Cinaedus?* Jesse didn’t even know what it meant. But perhaps that was good, it meant the attack didn’t have its full effect on him. Still, it took all his focus and discipline to not have his feelings really hurt.

“Give it up,” said Henderson, with a smirk. “You’re obviously outclassed, you... gaylord.”

Jesse wiped his cracked lips and rose to full height.

“That really all you got, old man? If I ate some alphabet soup I could shit out better insults than you.”

Henderson roared, his composure shattered, his face a scarlet mask of rage, and he ran to Jesse and grabbed him by the shirt, waggling a finger in his face. The rich sour smell of the man’s sweat, coupled with the pounding heat, made Jesse’s vision blur. He couldn’t faint. He had to win.

“You’re a... a fuck!” Henderson spat.

“And you’re a fuck *face!*” said Jesse, pushing him away.

“*Takes one to know one!*”

“*You* take one... up the bum.”

“*No, I don’t.*”

“*Yeah, you do.*”

“Loser!”

“Wimp!”

“Mega loser!”

Jesse could feel himself floundering. Henderson was too good. Too fierce. There was no choice; he had to use his trump card.

“Yeah... well... at least I have a penis.”

“W-what!”

Jesse felt dirty. It was a low blow, but this was a game Jesse couldn’t afford to lose. Unfortunately for Henderson, his high profile had made it easy for Jesse to dig up some dirt on him. And as sick as it made him feel, he went in for the kill.

“You’re a big girl with no penis who has to sit down when he pees. Your mother cries when she sees you cos she really badly wanted a son, but instead she has a hairy old daughter.”

Henderson feel to his knees on the dusty ground, sobbing. It hurt Jesse to see such a proud man laid low this way, but this was the life they’d chosen. He felt a sudden urge to help him up, but it was too late to make amends now. Already he could see the angry, shocked faces of the locals all around him, eyeing him like the demon he surely was. He felt no jubilation in his victory, no satisfaction. He’d gone too far. He’d have to leave, and soon, before things got ugly.

Without another word, Jesse drank deep from his flask, and headed out towards the desert, wondering if the fighting would ever stop. If he’d ever find peace. But in his heart he knew that this is what he was born to do, and what he would die doing."

BonzoTheBoss,AskHistorians,1390219895.0,"I am not a historian, however until someone more informed comes along... 

The Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the Treaty of Beijing in 1860, and The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory in 1898, gave the UK the control of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon (area south of Boundary Street), and the New Territories (area north of Boundary Street and south of the Shenzhen River, and outlying islands), respectively. Although Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to the United Kingdom in perpetuity, the control on the New Territories was a 99-year lease. The finite nature of the 99-year lease did not hinder Hong Kong's development as the New Territories were combined as a part of Hong Kong. By 1997, it was impractical to separate the three territories and only return the New Territories as Hong Kong is economically dependent on the surrounding area.

Not to mention the political and strategic military impracticalities of opposing the Chinese on their own doorstep. The Chinese could have reduced Hong Kong to a husk of it's former self if they chose to embargo it, and could have easily taken it militarily."

fruitjerky,ainbow,1390220026.0,"This belief comes from studies that state that about 1/3 of child sexuam abuse is male-male, despite homosexuals only making up a much smaller percentage of the population. Many studies mislabel this as ""homosexual molestation"" or even go as far as to label the pedo as ""homosexual"" without any further investigation into their orientation. Studies that actually do investigate the male's orientation find that around 99% of them have adult sexual relationships with women or no one at all.  
  
Here are some questions to ask them:  
""If a man is attracted to little girls, but is *never* attracted to adukt women, is he heterosexual?""  
""If a man is attracted to little boys and adult women (but not adult men), is he homosexual?""  
""If a man is attracted to children of either gender, but never adults, what is his sexual orientation?""  
  
They could just be fearful due to ignorance, or they could be perpetuating bullshit to justify their bigotry. Their answers to those questions will help you figure it out. (Spoiler alert: My dad failed miserably on all questions.)  
  
And, either way, I say come out to them and let them face what their bigotry means.

In six months, I've lost just over 60 lbs (268lbs as of this morning), have decreased my working and resting heart rates by 20bpm, increased by libido (my poor, poor wife) and just generally feel better and am happier (I think exercise endorphins improve mood- rest days I know I feel a little less vibrant).

In return for fixing your sink, a plumber gets money. In return for having sex with you, a prostitute gets to have sex with you. That's the problem. Sex is mutual and its own reward, so any sum of money (let alone hundreds of dollars an hour) paid for sex is exorbitant. Of course someone who has that as their only option would feel bad about it.

Not sure what point you're trying to make about bakers. Being a Thief is a job. Have you not played an RPG? More seriously, you can make a living stealing from others. It's not legal, but neither is prostitution in many places.

I think there's something problematic about a society that pays people more for successfully tricking people into paying for a shared bodily function than saving lives and building the future."

That being said, considering the way the US in particular depicts black people in the media and how many negative attributes are often attributed to black males (such as going to prison, which Lee is ironically heading towards when the game starts), I would consider Lee being black to be a pretty big detail, even though the majority of players likely did not acknowledge it beyond a subconscious level. In fact, having Lee be a black character probably made the human-human violence that you can choose to commit with Lee at various points in the story easier to commit and easier to attribute to that character as opposed to if he was white, such as (SPOILER) when you have the option to stab the creepy farm dude with the pitchfork in episode two of season one.

Peter Parker on the other hand.... ok, so they gave him a skateboard and attempted to make him seem slightly ""cooler"", which could be an interesting direction to take Spider-Man (what if he were a popular/cool kid?), but instead they just gave him a skateboard and had him have various interests that were relateable."

My best advice is to get out of Arkansas and move to a more progressive area where there are more people and better variety (more educated and self-respecting people). You have tech skills, that is your ticket West. Look into Denver, California, Oregon, or Washington, they all have big tech hot-spots where you could feasibly find a job.

When you get there, reinvent yourself, you're less likely to be surrounded by those same types of people you knew in Arkansas."

I can understand being stung initially - I too ended up with an engagement ring that I sort of felt like I had to pull teeth to get and made me feel like my then-fiance didn't really care - but as our engagement progressed I grew to realize that my now husband shows that he cares and loves me in ways that are unique to him, and that he didn't put much value in a ring as a traditional symbol of ""ownership"" and doesn't buy into the ridiculous diamond-company bullshit of 3 months salary for overpriced rocks from dubious ethical situations are values we BOTH share together.   Oh, and that he got me a pearl necklace (no jokes!) that was of top quality for my 30th birthday out of the blue because he really wanted to make that birthday special to me and the fact that he put thought into it on his own as a total surprise means way more than him fulfilling some socially obligated notion.  (side fact: I ended up losing the engagement ring, like an idiot, about a year ago, but I am extra careful with the necklace.  both are really meaningful to me, but I know that the necklace is more meaningful to him, so I take extra care with it to the point of paranoia, which is why I, who can lose any piece of jewelry, still have it.)

Not trying to regale you with a boring anecdote, but just explaining that these symbols don't mean the same thing to everybody, and while it's well within your rights to want a symbol of your relationship,  you've stumbled on a catch-22.  You want him to give you a symbol because it would be meaningful to him, but it won't be, because you had to ask for it.  He's offered something that was meaningful to him: rededicating the pendant.  That's really sweet and shows he understands this is meaningful to you.  

I'd be willing to bet that since he knows of your desire for a new symbol, he'll be on the lookout to get one eventually, but maybe he doesn't want to feel pressured or thinks it will ring false if he got it now since you two have clashed over it."

* They agree that women should have abortion rights

* They are generally socially liberal

* They want people who have committed rape to be prosecuted

* They do not see women as objects


The reason this community is anti-feminist has more to do with the behaviors of individual feminists they observe, of institutional feminist groups such as NOW, of the impact of certain feminist accomplishments on institutions such as Title IX, and of the conclusion of patriarchy theory in academic feminism.

In principle--we agree with feminists and are their allies.  I call myself one.

Where we disagree is in the ideology that patriarchy theory teaches, which suggests that because the rulers are men, men as a whole benefit and women are objectified.  We posit instead that regardless of the rulers' gender, men are objectified as expendable tools and women are objectified as baby makers all under the goal of population growth. 

Basically, we agree when feminists say 'patriarchy hurts men too', but we feel it doesn't help them--just the rulers (who will still do it if female)."

Mongoosen42,vegan,1390227342.0,"The best way to change people is to lead by example. I understand that it's a deeply important issue to you, literally a matter of life and death. But you also have to be pragmatic, and ask yourself the question, ""By what means will I change the most minds?"" Human beings are stubborn. When someone tells them what they should be doing, when a friend comes and preaches their views to us as righteous and truth and the objectively correct path, we shut that person out. we stop listening. That person comes off as arrogant and superior or else manic and overly dramatic.

I have many non-vegan friends, but I never preach at them. I will however invite them over to play video games and hang out, and while they are here I will cook for them and feed them my best vegan recipes. Recently I made a friend a vegan quesadilla, and he said ""Oh my god, I could eat 5 of these."" He started asking questions about how I made it, which led to questions about how I get all of my nutrients in my diet, which led to a discussion about why I chose veganism and why it's important to me. Now I'm certain he still went home and had meat for dinner, and I will never tell him not to do so. But by simply being open and sharing with him I am certain that he has a much more positive view and understanding of veganism than if I had preached at him.

You might try a similar approach. In the marketing world we call it the soft sell. And if you can over come your pride, you might consider apologizing to your friends for having acted overly aggressive towards them. Don't apologize for your views mind you, never do that. But you can, and possibly should, apologize for the way you have expressed them."

rmigz,leagueoflegends,1390228348.0,"Yes, but QSS isn't always slot efficient for AP Casters who scale better with Zhonya's Hourglass (since they will often times have Rabadon's Deathcap).  So, unless the player is smart enough to sacrifice efficiency to negate getting picked off by your ult, they will often times be following some cookie-cutter build.

The truth is not all 5 players are going to buy QSS vs. Warwick.  The reason Warwick is so good late game is that picking off a player and making it 4v5 late game is usually free Baron/Inhib or teamfight 4v5 to end.  So if you are able to pick off someone squishy (APC/ADC/Support) and melt their face off before they can blow any CDs on you then you've pretty much won the fight b/c Warwick's W is a crazy good teambuff for your ADC and his sustain on Q allows him to survive the teams burst when you ult in.

TLDR - He's just very good late game because he becomes a tank that can lifesteal a great deal off one Q (amplified by core item Spirit Visage), he has a crazy good AS steroid for the team pushing down objectives/teamfight, and he can completely neutralize a person in a teamfight or pick someone off fairly easy which heavily tilt the scales in your favor."

I acknowledge that sex is treated as a service by prostitutes, and that is what I don't like. It's not a healthy way to see other human beings. This isn't a chef doing their usual paid service for free. This is something free, in the same way that speech should be free, being falsely charged.

Commodities are worth what people would pay for them in rational circumstances, but people in some circumstances will pay more than what they're worth. Prostitution is one such circumstance.

The problem starts, if someone tries to argue that women, historically speaking, *""got the better end of the deal""*. The oppression of women is a historical fact, like, for example Second Punic War. There are only two possible reasons to argue otherwise:

* It stems from a specific outlook and is an attempt to push a political or quasi-political agenda - in that case, a person declaring women had it always better, is obviously not interested in discussing facts and is just bent on competing in, what is sometimes called *""oppression olympics""*;

* The person in question either exhibits lack of quite basic knowledge (easy to fix), or chooses to ignore simple facts in favor of their own world view - in that case, sadly, that person can stand in the same row as young Earth creationists or opponents of vaccinations."

Engineering really only has a couple things that sell well. Scopes aren't bad as hunters use them. Otherwise it's pets and mounts. (both of which needs items that share cooldown)

Depending on your server, inscription can be pretty cheap to level (compared to other professions) and can make you some pretty good gold (I've made probably 20-30k from inscription in the last month - it's been my workhorse for that timeframe...

If you want something to pair with mining, I would swap to either Blacksmithing or Jewelcrafting... If you have an alt that can enchant (or learn it), Jewelcrafting and running the shuffle makes some really good gold. 

If you DK is going to stay your main, I would HIGHLY recommend making that your enchanter instead of an alt. Having an enchanter as the first character you level in an xpac can make some good money.

Sharkictus,comicbooks,1390229821.0,"There's reason Kyle Rayner got to be White Lantern and not Hal...

In my head Hal's not a generic hero. He's cocky arrogant hero who has stupid kind of fearlessness. He's authoritarian, but quite the rebel. He's quite bit childish. He may not be an imaginative artist, but his constructs are sort of the things a typical child would make, simply silly, and bit surprising for a grown ass man to do. (I realize this sounds harsh on Hal, but I quite like the character because of this)

Guy Gardener is someone with incredible amount of willpower because he needs to impress. He's always overshadowed, so this makes him bit hard headed, but still rather fearless. His stupid mistakes he makes with being fearless are different but similar from Hal's. 

John Stewart's the professional. Former Marine. Current architect. His life isn't tragic, but it wasn't privileged either. He's rather hard to phase. His fearlessness doesn't make any mistake. However this has the issue with him being a bit colder, and like the other two he's has arrogance. It wasn't until after Xanshi he became less cold and more compassionate. His typical constructs are a bit bland, but for big stuff, he creates extremely solid constructs. 

Kyle Rayner however is man who literally embodies the whole emotional spectrum outside greed. He's optimist. He feels fear, but trucks on, and is willing to use his own fear to prevent from being in needlessly dangerous situations. He feels a great deal of compassion for every one , and he always has hope. He had very clearly once loved someone, very dear to him. He had felt rage at loss and injustice. He's an artist so his constructs are crazy awesome. "

This song was definitely the rawest and most aggressive track on that list, and from there I pursued a few more Slipknot songs.

It wasn't much later that MTV You Hear It (dun da dunn da da dun da dunn dudud) First showcased Shadows Fall as ""Slipknot meets (Judas Priest/Iron Maiden/something like that)"" that I really learned just what modern heavy metal sounded like.

phaqueue,WoWGoldMaking,1390230146.0,"here's the big question... Would you rather spend your time out collecting herbs/mining or would you rather spend some time standing at the AH and crafting/disenchanting and posting?

Personally - I'd rather spend my time in the city crafting and such - so I would go with Tailoring/Enchanting. 

Tailoring will make some gold with bags (people ALWAYS need more bagspace - and with the free 90s coming, more people will want more bags for alts.

For enchanting some quick money tips:

Download TSM and watch the tutorials one it (I believe phatlewts has a great tutorial series - at work so I don't have the link)

Use the disenchant search, you can make some REALLY easy money off this. 

Also - check the prices of Infinite Dust and Abyss Crystals on your server. You can buy abyss crystals and shatter them (enchanting recipe) giving you either infinite dust or greater essences (I forget which WotLK essences were - planar maybe?)

Also, use the ""destroy"" search option and search for ""Sha crystal"" you can usually find a couple MoP epics which disenchant into Sha Crystals posted for much less than the price of a sha crystal (and you have a chance to get 2 crystals when you DE - so you could make even more!)

The other VERY nice thing about tailoring/enchanting is that they both farm their own mats. If you want to craft something with tailoring and don't want to buy the mats or they aren't available, you can always just go farm them, same with enchanting. Enchanting also comes in very handy if you plan to solo any old content for xmog and such - you can DE the things you don't need and post them, some of the stuff sells really well to people leveling enchanting.

Hope this helps!"

It definitely has caused some stress in our relationship, but we're not quite ready for kids yet. I'm much younger than my husband so I definitely want to wait about two more years. At that point though, reversal will be out of the question and we may try extraction if we're candidates. 

Most of all, I know my husband feels guilty that a decision he made a long time ago with someone else effects us so heavily, and it absolutely did make me reconsider being with him from the get go.

This is kind of an active topic in my brain right now since I recently watched [A Prophet](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1235166/) and read and watched a bunch on The Numbers Gang (South African prison hang). 

Agree that something needs to be done but solving this would require treating people with dignity, which unfortunately would require a complete rehaul of our society.

I did also happen to run into the RmInitAdapter failed message on mine but it was in relation to 'fell off the bus' messages, which are detailed in the Issue ticket I linked.  You might check to see that there's a BIOS update for you and whether the fixes I put on the ticket help you."

* recharges faster
* can be turned off
* doesn't glow
* is way faster for running away

Back in the day ZOE *could* be left on all the time but the way it was ""supposed"" to be used was for being able to duck and dive between cover while having enough firepower to take down the guys at the other end.

I pretty much agree with Wrel, let us turn it off, make the damage boost more useful or replace it, fix the obnoxious glow. I probably still won't *use* it but it'd be useful.

Of course that'll never happen because anything that even smells like a ZOE buff will be met with outrage from 2/3 of the playerbase. They should probably just make three new abilities at this point and let us bitch about them selling the new ones for too much."

this guy's method may be to reduce the water that stays in the glass. He soaked the ice, which might start it melting (a little water raises the temperature of the ice, which melts it.) Then he stirs the ice, which I guess would spread a thin layer of cold meltwater inside the glass."

Speaking to this example specifically, I would go through the roof when you told me, but I'd be positively nuclear if I had to find out otherwise.  Believe it or not, it's not the sex-it's that you would have been two-timing on me **from the start of the relationship.**  It's my baseline assumption at the beginning of any dating relationship that, if we're interested in each other, that we're exclusive unless a conversation about exclusivity has been had that says otherwise.  I know that that goes against the grain of many in this sub, but I'm speaking from my own position here; if a potential partner doesn't think enough of me to give me an honest, full shot, then why should I do the same for her?

SPG is good in that you get a 5k point bonus when you transfer 20k points to an airline, making the points effectively worth 25% more.

&gt; What is the best card/cards I can get to maximize my returns?

SPG and CSP are definitely strong picks. Although to completely maximize your rewards, you can get into multiple cards at once. With your total spending, you will be able to hit minimum spends for sign-up bonuses very easily, racking up more points than you'll likely be able to use any time soon.

&gt; Another question I have is how can you save points of you don't want to keep a card because of the annual fee?

If it's an airline's co-branded credit card (Like Citi AAdvantage), the points post directly to your frequent flyer account with that airline. Those are yours to keep as long as you don't let them expire. (Any activity in 18-24 months in your FF account will keep them fresh.)

If it's a card that lets you transfer points to airlines, or otherwise credits you for travel expenses instead of booking directly with the airline's miles - those you will not keep if you cancel the card. Examples here are the Chase Ultimate Rewards family of cards (CSP, Freedom, etc.), SPG, Barclays World Arrival, etc.

&gt; do you just downgrade to the no annual fee version?

Most cards don't have a free version. You can call to see if they will waive the fee or add an incentive to keep the card, such as some points/miles.

For the cards that do have a free version, they will differ in benefits. For example, the CSP can be downgraded to a Chase Sapphire, but you will not be able to transfer your UR points to travel partners unless you have an Ink Bold or Ink Plus (both business cards) in your ensemble.

&gt; Also, what would you do if for example you get 35k points for a signup bonus but for the flight you want it costs 50k points are there options to pay the difference or do you just use the card until you get to those points?

Some airlines allow you to book travel with partial points + partial money. It's not always a good deal. Depending on the airline, you could book 1 way with points (usually 25k minimum for domestic) and the other way with money. Or you could purchase the remaining miles you need to book the entire trip with miles. Again, not always a good deal. Make sure to do the math."

sparsile,MakeupAddiction,1390233326.0,"**Product:** NYX Butter Gloss in Vanilla Cream Pie 

**Price:** $5-6 (don't quite remember) 

**Review:** I was looking for the new Butter Lipsticks but my Ulta didn't have them yet so I decided to try one of these. It's one of the smoothest gloss formulas I've ever used- not sticky at all. It adds a nice light pink flush, but I do wish it were a bit more pigmented. I think people who already like gloss will really like this product, and for people who don't, this is a great gloss to try. 

**Overall rating:** 8.5/10 


**Product:** Revlon ColorBurst Lacquer Balms in Vivacious and Enticing

**Price:** $7

**Review:** I am in love with both of these. Vivacious is a gorgeous hot pink and Enticing is a brick red. These are great ways to try out both colors, the formula is very buildable so that they can be subtle or more standout. For the price, these are great. My one qualm is that they don't last very long, and they don't really leave any kind of color or stain behind like their previous crayon balms did- I think it's because the new formula is so much more glossy- but I still love these. 

**Overall rating:** 9/10


**Product:** Revlon ColorBurst Matte Balm in Shameless 

**Price:** $7

**Review:** I picked this up because everyone was raving about it so much. The formula is nice and applies pretty evenly. It is a BRIGHT purple, though- it doesn't really tone down at all, and on me it just looked ridiculous. For those who want to try a more out-there color without paying high prices, this is a great product. It wasn't wearable for me, but I would still recommend this to others who want to try it. 

**Overall rating:** 7/10"

No. What you are talking about is an old boyfriend you've stayed friends with and your room/housemate who is more than a friend because you rely on each other for paying bills and maybe buying milk and tea bags every now and again.

I don't care if these relationships are ""too intense"" (in fairness if my housemate hasn't bought tea bags things get pretty scary) but there is no need to elevate relationships that aromantic people have beyond a friendship. To use Tumblr's favourite fandom Sherlock, would you call Jon and (the arguably aromantic) Sherlock any more than best friends? Calling them queerplatonic sounds ridiculous.

I'm a lesbian, so maybe this isn't as useful - but foreplay is something I absolutely need. I wouldn't be able to put up with someone who doesn't want to do that for me. If their goal is to just get off, as opposed to enjoying each others bodies and sharing pleasure in all its forms, I will not be back in bed with them. 

I'm also high-libido and was in an LTR with a low-libido partner. If you are sexually incompatible, then you are just plain incompatible. Either this is something you two need to actively work on so you can both be sexually satisfied, or you need to find someone that gives you what you need sexually as well as in other aspects of life. That goes for both you and him - it is not okay to make someone feel bad for having a libido that is either lower or higher than yours and one or both of you may not be able to compromise as much as necessary.

SentientBagOfWater,AskMen,1390234707.0,"I don't think there'll be much argument that it should be case by case.  Pretty much any sufficiently serious relationship which breaks down will result in a mix of anger and guilt to be dealt with on both sides.  Sometimes in that breakdown you'll learn things about each other that make you never want to see the other person again, other times the positive aspects are still there.

I have an ex, who I knew through to my mid 20s.  Man were we a thing.  Convinced we were going to take on the world together and win.  That doesn't come along every day.  When it ended we tried to stay around each other for months, but that guilt and anger affected us both, and it was difficult to move on.  Admitting to myself that we couldn't stay in contact and then sitting down to talk through that was one of the hardest things I've done in my life.  It was necessary though.

We'd talk sporadically over the last 8 or 9 years.  Usually it was a couple of emails, just checking that we were both still alive.  Midway through last year we properly got in touch, and for the first time since back then it seemed to be a positive thing for both of us.  She's moved on with her life, had other relationships over the years.  I'm sure I've grown a lot through the same time.  I've been lucky enough to rekindle one of the truest friendships I've had.  It hasn't been easy and there are moments of awkwardness.  Totally worth it.

Just for comparison, I haven't seen the girl I lived with for 3 years immediately before that since the day we went in together to close off our lease.  No idea what became of her after that, and quite frankly no interest."

UlgraTheTerrible,confession,1390234847.0,"... Why didn't you discuss this *before* you got married? Man, if you promised that lady a family and she really wants it, this might be a game changer, but you *have* to discuss with your spouse where you're at with this. 

After all, that is your wife. Your *wife*... That is the person who should be your very best friend. The person you should be going to *first* with these concerns... 

But I guess it's easier to ask the internet, eh? 

So... It doesn't matter if you're normal. Your responsibility here is to be true to yourself. Why you're asking if you should be in the relationship if you don't want to reproduce is beyond me... Maybe you should ask your wife that question, because she is the only one who should answer it. 

But if you can't ask your wife, then I'm afraid that your relationship is pretty damaged. If you want to keep it, you should probably seek couple's therapy. 

I can tell you one thing: You are so not ready to bring a child into the world. You need to fix your marriage and figure out what you want before you even consider it. 

Thing is, having kids is pretty great. And you're hardly doomed to be a shit father. Fact is, life is all about choices, and there are always one or more paths we could've taken that would've led us to be happier... Or maybe not. You never really know, because you never really get to go down the alternate route. You just do what you can to make the most amazing life possible with what you get after the decision has been made... 

Which pretty much means you *do have the power to decide* to be the best dad possible. Sure, you'll make some mistakes, but ultimately, happiness is a choice just as much as the decision whether or not to have kids is a choice. 

One thing I do know, no matter what you decide, the easiest way to be miserable is to indulge in what ""might've been"" while forgetting what *is*... 

So maybe, just maybe, you should go have a talk with your wife. A serious one. One that seriously looks at what you and her want your lives to look like in ten or twenty or thirty years. 

Personally, in 30 years, I'll be nearly 60. I hope I've got some grandkids on the way, and my daughter (and perhaps her future sibling?) have found decent partners or careers. I hope that I still have some old friends, and that my partner and I still enjoy cooking together and glasses of wine and going for walks. I imagine they'll be shorter walks, but still. I want to have an active social life, and hopefully have at least one book published by that point. I imagine I'll be actively plotting to spoil whatever grandkids I might have. And if my children fail to deliver, I'll have to ""adopt"" some grandkids. I really can't see ever ceasing to enjoy baking cookies, and it's been said by more than just me that I was born to be a gramma. (Which could be seen as quite insulting as I'm barely exiting my 20's, but I am what I am)

Saturday I had to work so I thought it would be a great day to test the phone in a normal day for me. I'm on Wifi at home and work, but work is spotty so it switches to 4G now and again). Phone was off the charger at 11am. I streamed podcasts, Songza, was on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, texted quite a bit and played with the camera. By the time I went to bed at 2am, the phone had 20% left. I set a backup alarm and went to bed.

Sunday morning I awoke to 7% and 20 hours on the battery with about 4 hours of screen time. Not too shabby. Let the phone charge, removed from charger at 10am and continued through another day of usage, a bit less to be honest because I wasn't playing with all the cool features. Went to bed at 3am with 40% left and just left it off the charger while I slept. Woke up with 25% left (23hrs, 28 minutes on battery with nearly 4 hours of screen time).

So with ART, battery saver, no Google Now (but I do have voice commands on, super cool btw!), removing all Google + accounts and turning off the auto-upload feature (I never use G+ anyways), wifi scanning off and Location set to battery saver, the phone is a winner.

The battery is fantastic! Honestly, it's better than my Razr MAXX because of the optimization that Moto has done with this phone.

**Now, Camera wise -**

This phone's camera is a hit or a miss. I had trouble in low light and in indoor lighting at home, but none at work. Really, my bulbs at home are yellow and I really need to replace them apparently!

Outside of that, love it. The images are crisp and clear on the screen, they preserve a lot of detail and the auto HDR feature really works when it does kick on. Moto just updated the camera yesterday (it's updatable through the Play store!) and most of the focus issues I had were quickly taken care of. There is a learning curve for the focus system, but it really involves turning manual focus on, dragging the circle and tapping to fire. Holding the focus circle fires continuous burst.

The active notification lock screen thing is super cool as well. I can check the time and read any texts, emails that come through (as well as anything else - you choose the notifications that it displays!).

Other than that, the phone is lightning quick and I do not regret it at all! Charges quick too. OH! The dimple on the back, underneath the camera, seriously, why don't all phones ahve this? Makes things SO much more comfortable.

The only thing I'm not happy about is I attempted to put my email as the signature on the back of the phone. It didn't fit, so I removed it. When I got the  phone, Moto put the signature on there still. So now my email is listed as XXXXXXXXXX@gmail.c . Close enough, right?

**Few tips:**
1) If you install facebook, turn off chat and notifications. I don't ahve messenger installed either. That saves battery quite a bit right there. Saturday had Facebook constantly wakelocking the phone and I corrected that issue immediately.

2) Be prepared to have a few crappy photos. Focus was the big issue. Learn how it works and it helps big time.

3) The photo editor built into the phone is fan-fucking tastic. Seriously, I have not used Snapseed once. 

4) Don't root the phone right away. Wait a bit. I was gung-ho to root for Greenify and Titanium backup before I realized that I wanted to see if I NEEDED those apps. I was surprised to find I didn't. Yes, there is bloatware from Verizon. Fortunately, none of them run without me telling them too so Titanium backup is no longer needed...for me. Greenify is an amazing app but I feel like Android has finally improved enough that it no longer needs to exist on this phone. Note: I said for me and this phone, these are my opinions and I'm sure that Greenify can crank that battery saving power up a few notches. I just don't need that.

5) Log into Google Drive on the phone and you get 50gb's of free storage for 2 years. Just saying, I'd personally take that!

6) The phone is slick, like slippery slick. I bought an Otterbox commuter and a Clear backed TPU case from INcase. I'm hoping this helps the phone sliding around so much. Also bought a tempered glass screen protector because I have to protec the screen. My MAXX has a perfect screen, even after 3 years.

Hope that helps, here is an imgur album with sample pictures and the battery stats for the two days. I really cannot say I regret buying this phone, I'm loving Moto right now :D

Mandreotti,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1390235205.0,"I normally play him jungle, so my views may not be the best, however you can read my points and think about how you want to play him as well.

I always evolve Q first for the isolated damage and extra range. It's his most powerful ability, so might as well pump it up first.

Secondly I evolve E for that extra leap range, in addition to the resetting cooldown on kills **and assists**. The assist part is important in case you need to leap away, or if you feel like doing 205 + 80% of your AD 3 times in a row (which, once maxed, is a pretty decent addition to your DPS.. although I would max E last, and spamming it on someone isn't really the best way to use it).

Last I either evolve his W or his R, depending on how their enemy team looks. If we need more slows and more pokes, W is the best. If I need to escape, chase, and look red, R would do better. His W gets maxed first on levels for a jungler just because of the extra damage/healing, since it's the most useful for me. W, as said 300 times from other people, is also useful for wave clearing.

To answer your question, you should evolve it when you think you need it. I wouldn't say first, just because you can probably get away with not clearing waves early game. Once you hit 11 it may be time to start pushing down mid turret, so that would be ample time to evolve it. However, if your team is already taking a turn for the worst by the time you hit 6... you may want to, just to get your team an early advantage.

**TL;DR: I play jungle, but for mid I would say evolve it at 6 or 11, depending on when you need to push your turret.**"

skgoa,AskHistorians,1390235394.0,"&gt; Also, I know that the Nazis were socialists and not capitalists (corporatists is probably what they meant) or communists.

The DAP added ""national-socialist"" (i.e. socialis with a nationalistic slant) to their name for propaganda purposes but they were never socialist. They actually considered socialists and communists as their biggest ideological enemy. It should however be noted that fascism is a form of anti-capitalism, just a different one. Capitalism is not an ideology, it's just a way to structure an economy. 

&gt; The successor nations of Nazi Germany were the E. and W. Germany. 

The German Democratic Republic refused to see itself as a successor state to the German Empire and considered herself an entirely new *socialist* state, liberated from fascist oppression by the Soviet Union. The Federal Republic of Germany however took up the mantle of being the successor state of the German Empire, whose diplomatic and contractual obligations were acknowledged as still binding. 

&gt; Is it simply because of geography that the Easterners became communists since they were closer to the Soviet Union, and the Westerners became socialist/capitalists like the Western Europeans by dint of geography? 

After the war, Germany was partitioned into 4 zones, which were administered by the 4 leading allied nations: Great Britain, the US, France and the SU. Those zones had been negotiated between the allies. You are correct in saying that it came down to geography in the end, since every occupant other than the US got a zone that was closer to their own country. Austria was occupied in a similar fashion.

&gt;Or were the pre-War populations of those areas already intrigued by those economic distribution models the same way that North Eastern Americans like the Progressive Party and the South East Americans tend to like the Conservative Party?

There are stark cultural differences between northern and southern Germans but I see no connection to Cold War era politics. 

&gt;How did the Eastern Germans view their contributions to WWII, 

Mostly denial, especially regarding war crimes. German workers had been forced to fight in a war by a fascist regime. Now they were free. But still, they had brought lots of destruction on Europe and so Germany had to suffer to repay. 

&gt;, and their new Overlords - the Soviets? It must have been awkward to teach the youth that millions died at the hands of the Soviets, yet these Soviets have helped written those same history books. Also, did they view the Soviets as their friends, 

East german propaganda and education was glorifying the Soviets for liberating the People. Also lots of denial about soviet soldiers murdering, plundering and raping. Obviously it's difficult to gauge to what degree average people actually believed the propaganda, especially because most would eventually have western television and would have listened to western radio for non-propaganda news. Undoubtedly there were many who either truly believe in the socialist cause and saw the repression of the state as a necessity on the way to Socialism, which was expected to become the state of society after three generations at the earliest. (Though as always this differs depending on who you ask, as there were lots of different socialist and communist sub-ideologies.) Most probably weren't fooled and saw themselves occupied by the Red Army, which kept a sizable force in the country. 

The abortive revolution of 1953 had demonstrated conclussively that the people were powerless to do anything about it as long as Moscow was ready to send in the tanks. As the decades went on, the people had it pretty good(although standards of living lacked behing the West by a quite obvious margin), as East Germany was the most visible of soviet satelite states. So they either left (if they managed to do so) or endured untill it became obvious that Moscow wouldn't intervene, at which point the revolution of 1989 started.

&gt;and the Western Germans as their enemies in your opinion?

Most people had family on the other side of the border. They would often recieve visits or packets from the West. This also led to a very active black market, which mostly operated with western Deutsche Mark. (People would even but up ads asking to do trades for ""blue tiles"", because the 100 DM note was blue at the time.) You could watch west german tv almost everywhere in East Germany. The notable exception was the aptly nicknamed ""valley of the clueless"" around dresden, were mountains blocked the signal. Many products that were sold in West Germany were produced in the East. During the later stages of the Cold War the West even gifted the East billions in hard currency to stave off economic collapse. While opinions differed on what the best course of action would be after the successful revolution against the east german state(as the protesters had only wanted democratic elections and a few other basic things at first and then suddenly the 2+4 Treaty happens), there was no notable resistance to re-unification and basically being taken over by the Federal Republic.


&gt; Here are my views on this episode: It's almost unbelievable that this even happened. I'm under the impression that the Germans were so upset and apologetic about their defeat that they over-compensated in their defeat. They did absolutely everything and more that their new over-lords wanted from them. 

I don't see occurences of this over-compensation (at least in the west) before the Holocaust tv series aired in 1978 an a sufficient number of war-generation germans had died so that public discourse could turn towards acknowledging the crimes committed during the war and coming to terms with it. But overall the Federal Republic saw itself as an important piece of NATO and not at all as a subjugated nation. The situation was somewhat different in the Democratic Republic but that's because the Soviet Union was very upfront about who called the shots. But still, the population at large grew ever more disilusioned with Socialism. They shed almost all of that ideology very quickly after re-unification. Thus it seems justified to say that neither side had managed to get the Germans fully into their camp. The only thing that kept either government in check was the threat of Red Army tanks rolling in and starting to kill people, which was much more likely to happen to Eastern German than to their western brethren but hindsight is 20/20.


&gt; It seems that their concessions after WWII were much more deeper than what was asked of them after WWI, at least culturally and (in the east) economically. 

The Allies certainly set out to transform Germany into a state (and later two seperate states) in such a way that there wouldn't be a third world war. Both sides made huge efforts to impart their ideology on the minds of the people on their side of the border. It is interesting that the Soviets took a very obvious and punitive route, while the Western Allies tried to get into the German's hearts and minds mostly through economic benefit. To this day capitalism and democracy are intertwined in public discourse. This was done because the last time there had been democratically elected leaders in Germany, it had resulted in the worst economic crisis in recent history and Hitler's rise to power. The Federal Republic still didn't take up Capitalism as her way of organising the economy and instead opted for the ""social market economy"", which was supposed to take the best parts of both sides.

First off, that's really cool haha. There are a ton of questions I'd like to ask you. I'm a PhD student working on biorenewable petrochemcials, and our primary feedstock is glucose from corn (i.e. We feed bacteria and yeast corn sugar, and they make metabolites that we can turn into chemicals that we used to get from petroleum). 

&gt; Land and seeds that is commonly used to grow forage crops is generally the worst quality land that is out there, and can not be reliably used to grow human-grade crops on a commercially acceptable scale.

According to [this chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_production_in_the_United_States#Production), ~30% of the corn grown in the US is used for feed for animals for slaughter. From what I understand, animal feed corn is different from the sweet corn or the cereal corn that humans ingest, but still require sun, fertilizer, water, and the such. 

Wouldn't the food output of the country skyrocket if we used it to grow food for consumption rather than food to feed animals for slaughter?"

This lends a little credence to a theory I've had for a while but haven't really fleshed out until now. Forgive me if it has redundancies, inaccuracies, or general long-windedness. I also don't have any of the books with me, so there's that.

If Benjen knew that Lyanna and Rhaegar shared some sort of affection for each other, it would be reasonable to postulate that Ned might have told Benjen of Jon's true parentage so that somebody would know the truth in the event of Ned dying or becoming otherwise incapacitated (assuming R+L=J, or at least N+W≠J). Benjen is the only adult Stark left at this point, so if Jon is truly his sister's son and not his brother's, it would make sense to tell him, especially if he witnessed the meeting of L&amp;R and was suspicious.

Benjen knowing Jon's true parentage is sort of pointless if Benjen is dead, of course. If Jon is truly dead, the information is certainly interesting, but it's unlikely that it would actually have any effect on the plot as a whole - even if Jon is Rhaegar's son, what claim does a dead man lay to the throne? What's he going to do, raise a host of wights and Others to press his claim? While it is silly to theorize that Jon is alive (or at least not permadead) just because we don't want him to be dead, which seems to be what starts a lot of the theories, I think Chekhov's gun implies that Jon *must* be alive because otherwise the entire mystery of his parentage would be a major red herring, and that doesn't really seem to be GRRM's style.

Benjen has never been confirmed dead, and while there's certainly nothing to imply he's still around there's not a whole lot telling us he's dead, aside from the far north being a generally dangerous place. Bear with me for a moment and assume that at least Jon is still alive, if not Benjen. Since we've been led on about it for five books, it makes sense that Jon's mother is still important, if not his father. While Jon would certainly like to know who it is, he's moved on and has more important things to deal with. For him to find out in the timeline of the books, he would either have to a) go looking for answers or b) be told by someone at the Wall or elsewhere in the North. The former seems unlikely, as he would pretty much have to go all the way to Dorne to get to the place he was born. While it's possible that there's somebody at the wall who knows and has been holding out until the time is right, I kind of doubt it. I guess Melisandre could see it in her fires, but we all know her specifics aren't to be trusted. I don't think Ned would have voluntarily told any of his bannermen when he returned from the war - it would have to be someone he could anticipate that Jon would grow to know and trust, else Jon wouldn't fully believe it. Therefore I think it is reasonable that Ned not only told Benjen the truth but refrained from telling anybody *else* the truth in order to keep it in the family. Unless he ended up telling Robb and da King in da Norf proceeded to put it in The Letter of Many Theoretical Possibilities but Unknown Actual Content, Benjen is the only one who knows, and Jon is likely to find out in one of three ways:

1. Benjen is still alive and reveals it himself.

2. Benjen's body is found with evidence of Jon's parentage.

3. Benjen, either while alive and indisposed or on his deathbed, sent someone to tell Jon.

I think any of these are plausible, but I think the first two are more likely - a courier would have gotten there already, unless *he* s found dead with the evidence. There you have it, I guess. I won't be surprised if there are a bunch of holes, but that's my general thought process on why Jon and potentially Benjen are still kicking, and Benjen seeing Lyanna and Rhaegar together at Harrenhal supports one of the main points."

Talk to your FWB and say you like her ex and want to carry on talking to her, but you're not comfortable with lying to her. See if you can reach some kind of agreement there, but at the very least make sure everybody's on the same page. Then bring it up with the ex when the time is right; if your FWB doesn't want you to sleep with the ex, it's very possible that the ex will find the idea of you sleeping with the FWB weird too.

It's easy to talk about taking advantage to opportunities when you're in a position aligned with your interests, but a lot of people go through public accounting because it is a necessary step in building a career.  It is just paying your dues for those people.  That doesn't mean they aren't cognizant of the opportunities and taking advantage of them.  It just means that they are in a job that is means to an end but not enjoyable.

Corporate finance is worlds away from audit or tax.  You can't look at all jobs being equal in big 4 any more than you would at some industrial company.  There are all kinds of services and all kinds of jobs.  If you find one that interests you, you're set!  There are certainly perks to the job, and there are certainly downsides.  No matter how much you enjoy what you do, no one is healthy and happy on busy season hours.  It's useful like a root canal.  But as with anything else you take the good with the bad.

The trick to surviving big 4 is to know why you're there.  Keep an open mind, maybe you'll love it and stay for the partner track.  Maybe not.  Either way is fine, you just have to know why you're there and hold yourself accountable to those goals.

I would rather slit my wrists than do corporate finance or tax.

greeklemoncake,magicTCG,1390236390.0,"1. Jund currently has Tarmogoyf, LiliOTV, and Bob. Should we ban those because they're expensive too? 

2. There are more tier-1 decks in modern than standard, diversity is not a problem. I think that the Ajundi/Lingering Jund lists are super interesting - much better than the ``4 Mutavault 20 swamp/island`` landbase of standard.

3. What about MTGO? Shuffling is literally instantaneous there, why shit all over everything? Courteous players will let their opponent do their turn while they fetch/shuffle anyway, saving a fair amount of time.

Also, what if RTR hadn't reprinted shocks and they rose to 20-30? Would you be saying that they need to be banned because they make fetches too good by fixing 2-3 colours? What about in 3+ years' time when a player who started in Theros-Huey standard, with no shocks in his collection, wants to get into modern? This game will always cost money. Timely reprints are the solution to prices getting out of hand - not bannings.

Making manabases worse = bad. There's a reason Wizards doesn't like to print (good) land destruction any more - because people like being able to cast spells. If you don't get to cast stuff, you get steamrolled and get bored. If your opponent isn't casting stuff, you steamroll them and get bored. Having the right colours of mana is not a bad thing.

* 1 pound ground beef (I used lean because it's what I had)
* 3 slices of Rudi's gluten free bread
* 1 egg
* Garlic, oregano, parsley, black ground pepper, salt


1. Toast three slices of bread on foil in toaster oven for 6 min (or 375 for 10 minutes). I do it this way so it gets crispy but only on one side.
2. Blend/food process it with garlic, oregano, pepper, and parsley. *This should make about half a cup of bread crumbs*
3. Combine ground beef, one egg, and spices in a bowl with bread crumbs. Work it with your hands only until it is JUST blended enough. Do not over work the meat.
4. Form balls and place in a pan on med-high heat. I use a TINY bit of olive oil with the lean meatballs so they don't stick.
5. Once the bottoms have browned a bit, roll each meatball. Start rolling them from the bottom. (once you do this twice, the heat in the pan should brown all sides).
6. Once all sides are browned a bit, add sauce of your choice. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and let it cook while you cook your pasta (or for 10-14 minutes).

BAM. Meatballs.

You can also add Parmesan to the breadcrumbs. But they can get too salty.

Daiteach,DnD,1390236918.0,"If there's a chance of something meaningful and interesting happening on the way out, then sure, but in many dungeons it's just not worth the playtime. (And ""there are four rats in this side room that they missed on the way down"" is not ""something meaningful and interesting."") Spending playtime zoomed in on any activity has opportunity costs in that that's (real life) time that you can't spend doing something else, so I definitely think it's a bad idea to make the players spend a bunch of real-life time doing something boring, and I think that high-detail pacing through a situation where there's a minimal chance of anything important happening is, in fact, boring.

I don't really understand the distinction made in the first post between saying ""you take some hours to climb out"" and giving the players an out-of-dungeon teleporter. It's basically the same experience from a play perspective, unless you actually make the actual players wait several real-life hours while the characters climb out or something. Fast-forwarding through uneventful stretches is something that it's impossible to *not* do - you certainly don't make players wait while the characters ""take some hours"" to sleep - and I certainly wouldn't make the players describe what they're doing on the way out in as much detail as they did on the way in, unless it's genuinely comparably interesting."

Voting is still largely a popularity contest, and people can't even take the time to learn what they're voting for. The number of people who expected me to support Obama simply because he was black is ridiculous. 

It doesn't take much to send one letter to a representative a year. It doesn't take much to read the websites of a few candidates, or to hit a few decent websites.  It doesn't take a polisci degree, because the people who put out this information on both sides want it to be as simple as possible, and it's isn't crazy hard to pull some truth out of two biased opinions anyway.

Feminism isn't something that has an entrance fee.  It's a way of relieving oppression and helping the underprivileged achieve equality.  If feminism did not include trans people it's bad feminism.

&gt;Don't you realize this only validates their argument on MTFs' constant desperate attempts to have feminism, women, and the whole society universally accommodate them above all?

No it doesn't.  Trans women are allowed to complain that cis feminism does not meet their needs.  Also don't call trans women desperate, not really cool at all.  

You're just repeating a privileged talking point that trans people wanting equality is wanting to be ""accommodated above all.""  Privileged people feel entitled to the inequality of the status quo as a rule.


&gt;Forget them. They don't like you, they NEVER will, EVER, even if you were to perfectly play to their tune, trust me. Look past their label and realize these people aren't ""good guys"", and they don't ""count"" for anything extra because of said label.

Agreed.

&gt; If there is anything to learn from all of this (or them rather, credit where it's due), it's to make peace with only being 90% (or 99%, or 50%, whatever percentage you prefer, really) rather than 100% woman. . .

I don't understand how percentages of woman concept is supposed to work.  Seems like it's just a rewording of concept that some women are more real than others (aka white, middle class cis women).  

&gt;...understand that a great deal of what you consider as part of being a woman is just social fabrication...

Social construction of identities does not mean those identities are aren't meaningful or real.  So I guess if your point is that because something is social in its origins you shouldn't take it seriously, I'd have to disagree.

BonzoTheBoss,DaystromInstitute,1390237955.0,"A similar topic was submitted 7 days ago [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/1v2727/two_new_to_me_qualms_with_the_next_phase/). To copy my response from that thread:

I think first of all we need to identify the objectives of the Romulan scientists that engineered phase cloak technology. What was their goal? Simply cloaking matter than can pass through other matter sounds (relatively) easy once you've got the basics of the interphasic cloaking technology in place.

However in order to keep the military and Tal'shiar happy, it needs to have practical military and intelligence applications. This means you need to be able to scale the scope of your phase cloak, from anywhere to a entire starbase and all its personnel to an individual spy.

What are the practical obstacles faced with achieving these goals? Starting at the top with starbases, and starships, it sounds like a relatively simple objective to realise. If the whole structure and all it's associated systems (grav plating, life support, energy generation and distribution...) are all interphased at the same time, they should (theoretically) continue to interact with one another as normal. You may run into problems when you start running out of stored interphased matter for replication, anti-matter and oxygen for breathing (although Romulan starships use micro-singularities, so I'm not sure how they interact with the phase cloak) but you can stock up on those fairly easily, enough to only require coming into phase with the rest of space once every few months.

So what about the practical limitations of phase cloaking an individual? How do you stop them falling through the floor into space if they're aboard an enemy starship or into the core of a planet? How do they breath, or see, or eat?

To answer these questions I posit that a personal phase cloaker does more than simply shift your matter into an alternate interphasic dimension, it also applies a number of different persistent fields around your body as well so you can have some limited interaction with the universe. Let's start with the most pressing one, how to stop you from falling through the floor? I posit the phase cloaker covers you with a field of polarized interphasic gravitons, that interact with the gravitons of a mass field generated by gravity plating or the natural gravity well of a planet, causing resistance and thus preventing you from falling through the floor.

How do you breath? Or eat? We must examine what an interphasic rift is to understand how a humanoid can exist in one. Memory Alpha defines interphasic space as:

&gt;Spatial interphase, also known as interspace or an interphasic rift, was a phenomenon in which the fabric of space began to break up, allowing an overlap of parallel universes on different dimensional planes. The rift itself also contained a completely empty realm, devoid of life, between the dimensional planes.

That to me implies a number of things. Either the scientists are able to focus the interphasic field to intersect a parallel domain wherein metabolic processes can be maintained on a mollecular level by merely interacting with it (where ATP is just kinetically floating and can penetrate your cells for use?), or the void field between dimensions creates a form of quantum statis of the cells so they no longer need to respire, but you retain a cyclic quantum energy so you continue to function. That isn't to say that there aren't downsides to this. We can hypothesize that prolonged time in an interphasic state can begin to cause celluar degredation at the quantum level, as see in ""TNG: Phantasms"". (True the celluar degredation in that episode was being caused by interphasic ""leeches"", but as we do not know what method they were using to interact with the crew's cells in normal space, I don't think it's a stretch)

How can you see? Well we know that light behaves in the same way in all frames of reference in our normal spatial dimensions, what's to say it doesn't behave the same across the interphasic spectrum as well? Light is light and can be used by your optical cells regardless of what phase you're in.

**TL;DR:** The Romulan Interphasic Cloaking Device doesn't just push matter into an interphasic rift, it targets the phasing and adapts a number of sub atomic fields to maintain life during interphase."

Seriously, I know a lot of people with kids. A lot. The ones who don't like it are generally people who choose misery at *every* turn. The ones who do are the ones who choose happiness... 

Which isn't to say that the ones who choose happiness have it easy, just that there is something about them that prompts them to, say, deal with their problems in an openminded and proactive fashion, rather than avoiding or ignoring or beating them into submission. 

To be honest, it sounds like you could use some individual therapy yourself, so you learn how to, you know, cope with stress, make positive choices, that sort of thing. 

And maybe you shouldn't let your life be decided by what everyone else is doing or saying. If you don't want kids for you, that's fine, but make sure it's a decision you're making because *you* know it's the right decision for you, not because it might've been the right decision for someone else.

Willravel,Cheap_Meals,1390238437.0,"Wraps are a good direction to head in if you don't have access to a means of cooking like a microwave, stovetop or oven. I had mostly wraps for lunch back when I was in college about a decade ago, and the variability of what you can put in wraps kept it more than a little interesting, while the wrap design made it convenient for eating on the go. The wraps themselves were usually smaller flour tortillas, but I'd opt for the spinach wraps when I could as they had more nutrients and flavor. 

IIRC, I grouped my wrap recipes into meats, vegetables, and other. 

For meats, I'd usually combine something like cold cuts or pieces of chicken, pork, beef, or turkey with cheap bagged salad mix (which I cleaned and kept in a salad spinner in a small dorm and later apartment fridge), mustard, and maybe some cheese. This alone provides a great deal of variability. One day I'd have leftover steak strips with three hearts salad mix (Romaine, green leaf, and butter lettuce hearts), a little cheddar, and some mustard. The tortilla gave me quick energy, the steak filled me up and gave me protein, the salad provided fiber and a whole host of nutrients, and the mustard was delicious because mustard is delicious. The next time, I might have chicken with Jack cheese and Dijon or turkey with sliced apple or ham and swiss. 

For vegetables, it would basically be a garden salad in a wrap. I might have salad mix with a little chopped red onion, pepperocncini, tomato, black olives, and dressing. The next time I might have corn, green onions, and black beans with the salad mix. The idea is to give yourself something chock full of vegetables, but to let the salad mix to make up the bulk of it to save money on the better ingredients. If you're careful, you can have things like asparagus, broccoli, squash, green onions, avocado, bell pepper, and other more expensive produce without breaking the bank. 

For other, I'd take something people normally don't eat in wraps and jam it in there, like chili, tuna/chicken salad, hummus, etc. This took a bit of experimenting, as some things don't work in wraps (like stew or ice cream), but can result in a wider variety of foods. 

I'd alternate between these three things, so every three days I'd have a meat wrap, separated by a day of a vegetable wrap and an other wrap, which kept things from getting boring. I'd buy in bulk after planning out all my meals so I could keep costs down and never wonder what I was going to eat. And I only ate wraps I loved, so I'd always look forward to eating them and, more importantly, would stay motivated to prepare them. "

&gt;This is a subreddit for people intending to quit or trying to figure out whether they should.


You're in the place where you think you may have a problem and are questioning. It's a good first step. If you were to continually post on r/leaves like ""dude, I'm so baked"" type of posts, that would be one thing - but this is your first post, and the substance of that post was completely appropriate. You gotta start somewhere.

In the real world where you have to compromise with your partner and you actually give a shit about them, making elaborate porn-dollies of your IN-OFFICE CO-WORKER is completely fucked up and inappropriate behaviour. Do people fantastize about the NPCs in their life? Sure. I do, myself. And in fact, I consume more porn than my husband does.

Does that mean that studying facebook photos and porn lookalikes while jerking it is a-fucking-ok, particularly when your sex life is suffering? NO IT DOES NOT.

The_White_Baron,cheatatmathhomework,1390238927.0,"When you factor quadratics, you get something like 

(x + 3)(x - 2), right? The +3 and -2 multiply to give you a term -6. Notice how there is no x in this term, and it is the only term in the quadratic that doesn't have an equation. 3 and -2 are also factors of -6.

The same logic applies to cubics. If you have something like

(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 7), the only term that *doesn't* have an x in it will be 7\*(-4)(+2). So I'm working backwards from that idea. If the constant term in our cubic is +8, the *number* terms in our equation must be factors of 8.

What are the factors of 8? 1, 2, 4, and 8. But you also have to include the possibility that some of these factors might be negative.

This is all assuming the term multiplying x is 1. If you have something like

(2x - 1)(3x + 1), then the polynomial is 6x^(2) + ... - 1.

Notice how 6 is the product of 2 and 3. So, working backwards as we did before, the leading coefficient in our cubic tells us that the coefficients in front of x must be factors of 3.

That's simpler since those factors are 1 and 3. 

So when I listed those numbers, I only listed a few. Other possibilities could have been (3x - 8) or (3x + 1), in which case you'd guess a root x = 8/3 etc. But those are nastier to work with. I'd rather try to guess one of the easier roots, like 2."

Most recently I recall that mutants were being more and more accepted especially after House of M and Mutants No More but due to small numbers tye went full aggro and brought back X-Force. Now things got shakey again when mankind found out Magneto was wokig WITH the X-Men now but I would say it seemed 50-50...then Pheonix came back though and te world saw what Cyclops did to the world and more importantly Xavier.

Due to all this and mutants coming back we are back to square one where the world mostly hates mutants again although for the first time they seem to be addressing the superhero worlds thoughts on all this and I'm loving it. "

lavenderblue,TwoXChromosomes,1390239465.0,"I think that it can be harder to define an ""orgasm"" for a woman than a man .  For me, it's any sort of rythmic and pleasurable contractions in my pelvic floor.  I can get one from just rubbing funny in my jeans or from sex, but the length, duration, and intensity of the ""orgasm"" varies.  If I'm just sitting in class and get one, I call it an orgasm.  If I had the same sensation during sex, and had already had larger waves, I probably wouldn't and just call it a mini spasm.  It depends.

Also, I have trouble getting past the mini spasms on my own.  As soon as I feel them, I tend to stop doing what I'm doing. I need a partner to keep the stimulation going and get me past that hump to ohmygodwow.

Manly-man,Hunting,1390239535.0,"First off, I would suggest picking up a shotgun.  Shotguns give you the versatility to hunt just about any Ohio game animal with just a change of ammunition.  You can't go wrong with a Remington 870 express or a Mossberg 500 but don't limit yourself to them.  You can find some great used semi-auto's and break actions for relatively little cost.  I would suggest something chambered in 12 gauge.  

Once you get yourself a weapon, take it to a gun range and before you start shooting ask someone for help.  You may know a little, but safely and properly operating your firearm isn't a trial and error learning experience.  Pretend you're 5 years-old and someone is teaching you.  

A hunter education course is the first step to becoming a licensed hunter.  You'll learn the basics and its a great place to ask questions.  You can purchase a hunting license online, but read up on the laws and regulations for the targeted game.  For instance you need a deer permit to hunt deer, a turkey permit to hunt turkey, and a fur taker permit to hunt fur baring species like fox.  

The best way to learn is to go with an experienced hunter, but if you don't have a hunter friend that can help you out (I was in the same boat when I started hunting) I have a few tips.  Before you try hunting, just walk the woods without your gun.  Get into the mindset that you're hunting and just observe.  Walk with care, don't go tramping through the woods like you've got somewhere to be, try to be quiet, and pay attention.  Find the paths the animals take, find the food sources, watch how they react to you when they know you're around.  Half of hunting is learning how to walk ( or sit ) in the woods.

When you feel comfortable with your gun and you have a license and a place to hunt, go squirrel hunting.  It seems childish, but you'll learn a lot about hunting the harder species like deer just by squirrel and rabbit hunting.  

Most importantly, ask lots of questions.  If you don't have a teacher, look at some instructional videos on youtube, they can be helpful, also r/hunting is a great reference.  Read people's threads and look at he picture comments.  Sometimes you can pull little bits of information that will make your next hunt from places you wouldn't expect.  "

piggybankcowboy,amateurradio,1390239775.0,"I feel like a lot of the talk about shortwave slowly dying is coming from US  mainland listeners. There's still a ton out there on the air, but most of it is difficult to pick up here in the US, largely due to our location. When you think about it, we're a bit isolated by comparison. So, when SWLing, we tend to have to wait for those perfect atmospheric conditions, or have to have units with better selectivity/sensitivity, etc. 

On top of that, it's unfortunate that most of what comes out of our own country on SW are religious broadcasts that tend toward the extreme versions of their respective faiths. So, in that sense, we are already limited to what we have available to listen to, and that adds to the discouragement of the hobby. 

In short, shortwave is still pretty alive and well, by my reckoning...just on the other side of the world. Maybe those gov'ts will find uses for the quiet portions of bands, but I think it will take awhile for that to happen. I doubt they'll touch the ham allocations, personally, but I could be wrong. It seems to me, at least here in the US, hams are more of an asset than a burden to the gov't, since we're able to help out with comms in disasters and such. And heck, it's not like they have to pay us a wage to do so, so I really can't see them saying no to free volunteers who step up to the plate when needed.

I posted a [a mathematical analysis of mana efficiency of Storm items](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1uezp1/mathematical_analysis_of_storm_spirit_item_builds/) a while ago, but most people did not see it due to the DotA know-it-alls immediately replying with things such as ""Hurr but u need bkb"" and downvoting without realizing the analysis only took into account ulti-mana efficiency.

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1390240023.0,"I understand that's the point, but it's wrong.  For instance, the argument that the bible is against interracial marriage:

&gt;“The Bible clearly teaches, starting in the tenth chapter of Genesis and going all the way through, that God has put differences among people on the earth to keep the earth divided.”

1. The bible records people having concerns over marrying idol-worshippers, not others in general
* The reasoning behind forbidding marriage to other groups is *explicitly* religious
* The command to not intermarry is explicitly directed at the Israelites and references only the other Canaanite nations
* The bible contains God rebuking Aaron and Miriam for insulting Moses' marriage to a Nubian woman
* Positive eschatological passages often contain references to people being united, *not* having the ""earth divided""

The argument is bad because we think that interracial marriage is OK, yes, but it's also simply wrong--the bible just doesn't say that.  Bob Jones wouldn't know a solid biblical argument if it hit him in the head--he's just making stuff up.  It's ridiculous in hindsight, but not only because it's in hindsight.  There's a reason other religions working with the same bible didn't prohibit racial intermarriage--there's absolutely no basis for not allowing it."

temp9876,relationship_advice,1390240159.0,"You've got to talk it out and get on the same page.  Learning to ski takes a day, but advancing from the bunny hill can be the work of YEARS.  In the meantime, you're not going to get anywhere until she understands your desire to ski more challenging runs.  Try to find a comparison from the activities that she does well, something where you can't keep up and she doesn't slow down to hold your hand, and you're both happy with that arrangement.   Otherwise, you've got to explain to her that you feel it is unfair that she expects you to give up something you enjoy because she can't do it with you.

I think that separate ski trips is nothing but a stop-gap measure, it won't address her insecurity, might make it worse and breed resentment.  I think it will be more effective to find a way for your ski trips to work together.  Going with a group of friends of mixed skill levels would give each of you the opportunity to pair off for the runs you prefer, and allow you to enjoy one another's company at the end of the day.  It would also be good for you to plan ski together time at her level without holding you back for the whole holiday.  You can also get her lessons with a pro and take that time to ski on your own.

Even if she acquires the skill for more advanced runs, she may never enjoy the challenge the way you do.  That's how I am, and my more daring husband and I have had to find the same kind of compromise so that we both enjoy our trips.  I would not be happy with separate trips.  You just have to find the balance that works for you, and get her in control of her insecurity."

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1390240291.0,"I think the post-apocalyptic angle gives a bit more credence to the D&amp;D-dichotomy you've got going, but not enough. You *can* (and many authors have) just handwave your meta-cosmology, but deciding not to choose is still a choice. What I mean by meta-cosmology is that you're describing these *gods* as though they're *real,* that is, personified *actors* with some sense of will and rationality, and then you've described them with *roles.*

Not good. Mostly because that's the structure of lots of con-myths but it's nothing like a real-world myth so it reads off as very bland. The question at the moment really is if the goddess and god are more people, or more forces. For comparison, you could look to Greek myths - the Titans are more forces embodied because the forces arise from them, from their natural tendencies, while the gods are definitely *actors,* who happen to have jobs because gods and mortals have decided things need doing. Titans do their jobs just by existing, while the gods sometimes quit, slack off, or engage themselves in other things.

The difference doesn't matter so much when your gods don't actually exist, or there's a question about it in-universe. When they clearly *do* exist, then you've got to make a decision and then *explain* that decision. Greek gods are *actors,* but they sprung from effectively natural processes of the natural world which existed before them, which they set about managing. But there were *forces* before them, Titans, which made the world. The author Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen has gods who are *both* - they are actors with their own purposes and desires but are *constrained* due to the way worship works, and that worshipers in aggregate get to control their god, and not the other way around.

So you need to decide, is your goddess of conflict the force of conflict personified, or is she an extremely powerful being and has some sort of emotional or philosophical reason to cause conflict? I mean, she could just be a giant bitch, but that means she may not always act in favor of the greatest conflict, just on her whims. That means you have to define something else for her - her personality. If she's a force of conflict, then what happens if she was killed? Obviously new gods don't arise out of nowhere to take the place of old ones. What happens to vacated godheads?

In real-world myths, the gods are almost always actors with jobs and not roles personified. Greek, Norse, Aztec, Lakota, etc. This is not universally the case - Mongolian and Japanese myth, particularly - and the line is sometimes straddled - like the lua in Voudou, or the various spirits in Hinduism. But if you're going to write this character in any way, you have to decide who she really is. The same goes for your god of darkness, obviously."

I don't think it's possible to even describe attitudes in the conflict without writing a book, let alone ascribe those attitudes to specific events.  It's like asking ""to what extent are American political attitudes shaped by the Watergate Scandal"".  Any answer has to answer the question of what American political attitudes are, and in order to do that you have to simplify so much that the answer is meaningless.

To reshape your question a bit--if you're asking to what extent the Declaration of Independence was a watershed moment in the conflict in general, the answer is probably no, though it's still a tough question to formulate an answer to.  As I noted in my top comment, the conflict had been intensifying for decades before, often violently, and events after still affected the course of the conflict.  It's not as though declaring independence was some big surprise that put events afterwards on a predetermined course."

No but seriously, I met my wife at a college football game.  She was sitting down at a tailgate of a friend of a friend.  

I saw her and two other girls sitting there so I sat right there in the middle of all of them and started chatting them up.  The one I happened to hit it off the best was the one who became my wife.  And she was dating someone else. 

I actually ended up dating one of the other girls that was sitting there that day, but it fizzled out after a few dates (it happens).  In the meantime my wife became single, so I invited to dinner and drinks.  We managed to hit off just as well as we did when we first met.  One of the guys sitting at the bar we went to found us so entertaining he picked up our tab. 

We became fast friends, best friends, but only friends for a while.  I think my phone bill that first month we were friends showed 12000 text messages!  I had a suspicion she liked me but I was never 100% sure until she went out with another guy on a bad date, the guy got her drunk, then she texted me to come get her and we ended up kissing that night.  

Our second anniversary was last week.

It really is that simple.  I think one key thing to notice about the mentality of guys like you vs guys like me, is that it seems like you pick the girl you want before you even know her.  Just go out and meet people, some people you'll hit it off with some people you wont.  Don't focus on one person before you really know them, remember the day I met my wife I ended up dating one of the other girls that was sitting there before I had a shot with my wife. "

For an abolitionist (a position I deeply identify with) to say ""the Bible clearly says we should free slaves!"" is wrong in two ways. First, it doesn't really say that. Second, if it was truly clear then there would be no point in saying it. The simple fact that you have an opponent who also appeals to scripture is, in some way, proof that it is not clear.

Maybe not.  But it does say that it's only clear which arguments were *actually* based on the bible are in hindsight, effectively meaning that it's impossible to judge arguments about what the bible says until time passes (meaning we should ignore them).  And I think that's misguided.  Some arguments are simply bad arguments--no hindsight needed."

cr42,college,1390240576.0,"I think this is a good idea. Surely things as simple as ""you have to take classes X, Y and Z"" can be answered by each university's respective course catalog, but I think that having people volunteer their thoughts and opinions of their field of study would be beneficial.

Do we need to hit *every* major? **No**. Do we need to have *tons* of input for a given field? **No**. But I think that a document like this would help younger students who are still deciding on their major. 

Things like ""why I chose to study X"" (did you already know what career you wanted, did you really like the discipline itself, did someone force you, or did you just throw a dart at a board, etc.) and ""why I like/dislike studying X"" (are the classes too challenging, are they too easy, do you find them boring, etc.) are things that I would have wanted to hear when choosing my major, if not to actually help me *decide*, just to get an idea of what my peers were thinking about during their decision.

OxymoronParadox,harrypotter,1390241501.0,"For me (in the US, so I have no idea what its even like in UK), it was the health/PE teachers who would teach you about being healthy, your body and CPR. For sex ed, there would be a nurse who would come in during that period to teach you the rest of the birds and bees, and give you a test on it (which was part of the health/PE grade). I guess this way so you won't have to make awkward eye contact with your teacher for the rest of the year.

So maybe someone from St. Mungos would come into a class (I can see Herbology or Transfiguration since it seems like the classes most likely to teach human anatomy) for a week and that is like ""Magical Sex Health"" week.

OriginalStomper,atheism,1390241529.0,"&gt;&gt; At addressing empirical issues, sure. Is the existence of a deity an empirical issue? I don't see how it could be.

&gt; That's just what people who can't prove anything say...

And that's just what Naturalist philosophers say.

&gt;Religion/faith in a deity are generally linked to lack of education/exposure to science.

Correlation is not causation.  How does a general correlation suggest that more education will actually reduce the prevalence of religion?

Isn't the Harris Poll fatally flawed due to being online?  Per your wiki link:

&gt;In the U.S., 55 percent of atheists are under age 35, while 30 percent are 50 and over (compared to 37 percent of the total population).

Also per the wiki link:

&gt;The latest statistics show that a lack of religious identity increased in every U.S. state between 1990 and 2008.[41] However less than 2% of the U.S. population describes itself as atheist.[42]

Assuming more people are becoming unaffiliated with any particular religion, that does not demonstrate atheism is growing and it does not appear tied to education."

Switch Axes use attack coefficients up to about 0.46 (for normal, frequent attacks), where something like the SnS only goes up to 0.24. This means that as far as total damage done goes, the SnS will have a higher percentage of that damage be elemental than the SA would.

Second, make friends with single guys. Not sure where you live but where I live, nobody really talks to each other (men or women) unless they already know each other or have a friend of a friend; this is harder to talk to people. 

Third, when you talk to a girl, or anyone for that matter, be yourself. You could play the cool guy who's mysterious and just let's her talk, so let her blow all her wind out until she thinks you're a good listener, then she'll wanna know more about you. It also doesn't hurt to have a wing-man that talks a lot because, you can sit back and watch how girls respond to what he's saying and learn from that.

davinox,magicTCG,1390242183.0,"Here's my confession. I consider the game ""beneath me,"" and I hate that fact.

I absolutely love the game, especially the deckbuilding aspect. About 12 years ago I was so active I was the top poster of a popular mtg forum MTGNews (same username). Played in Type 1 tournaments. I was about 15.

I sold my cards when I went to college, stopped reading about it, and proceeded to go on with my life. 

In the last year or so my interest returned (""What, no mana burn?"" ""What, creatures are THIS powerful?"" ""What the fuck is 'Cancel?' Where's Counterspell?"" ""Weird. Planeswalkers. Equipment. Crazy."")

I've been reading a shitload about Magic on my off-time, especially about the current Tier 1 competitive decks. But I don't want to buy cards and start playing.

I don't know. I hate this stigma, but I feel like if I buy a bunch of playing cards and spend my weekends playing with them that I'll have regressed in some way. Shouldn't I be rock climbing or volunteering or dating or something more akin to the 30-something lifestyle I am so clearly approaching?

I guess I feel like Magic is a game for kids, since I was so into it as a kid. The strategy is so interesting and the game is wonderful, but I feel like it's a guilty pleasure, and I can't see myself really jumping in again, even though a part of me really wants to.

First of all, this is the same thing. Your doctor counts from last period, approximately 2 weeks before conception. Digital reader counts from conception, approximately 2 weeks since last period. In general here we count from last period, so you are 3-4 weeks (if you were to say 1-2 it would come off as not even being pregnant yet)

Second of all, you caught it very very early and can treat it. Currently your baby is a bundle of cells who doesnt even have a functioning placenta or a heartbeat. 

So focus on getting yourself righted out for your baby.

I know how scary it is. Not completely,  I only have hashimotos disease, but I had it undiagnosed and untreated for three kids and only got diagnosed at the end of my fourth pregnancy (I say this as with my history my endo is positive ive had it undiagnosed since puberty) and none of my children were negatively effected, despite the very VERY real possibility that I was very hypo through my pregnancies.

cfedey,MonsterHunter,1390242480.0,"It's not really 71% Raw and 10% Elemental. Raw damage depends on the weapon, the attack, the hitzone, your sharpness, and your current weapon damage value. The formula looks like this: 

    Raw=(Damage*Attack*Sharpness*Hitzone/WeaponClass)

The formula for Elemental damage is independent of weapon though, and looks like this:

    Element=(EleDmg*EleSharpness*EleHitzone/10)

These are slightly simplified formulas with things like monster rage defense boosts, higher rank defense boosts, and Low Sharpness Modifiers taken out. 

So this is the reason elemental damage is good for fast weapons like SnS, DB, and others, while Raw is king for GS and Hammer. Attack values for slow weapons are much higher than those for fast weapons, so on a per hit basis they have much more raw damage than elemental damage. 

Status damage, if you're wondering, is just 10% of the displayed value per application, but it doesn't apply every hit. There's a chance per hit for status to apply. "

Are you assuming that I don't think people use guns within their homes against people they think are attempting to burglarize them? Because I never said that, nor would I. What I was saying is that they don't make you safe, they make you *feel* safe.

It appears you're trying to make the point that guns keep you safe from home intruders?

What you'd need to do is see if you're statistically more at risk from dying (unarmed) during a home invasion than you are at risk of injury or death (accidental or otherwise) from simple firearm ownership. That would be an argument for firearm ownership based on objective data. What I feel you presented me (and thank you) is a categorized compilation of one small section of the issue. Clearly it's the section of the issue that you want to focus on because it fits the narrative you believe in, that I don't fault you for at all. Only makes sense. But when I talk about Epistemic Closure this is what I'm taking about."

Sub-300 dollars ACTUALLY means that it's selling well among low income families and individuals. People buying laptops for shits and giggles don't really make much of any market, period. As for your article, a one off article on a german language site I've never heard of is an awesome source. Either way, universities and lower school systems alike are buying them in droves to give to students, as they are easier to lock down, and offer a good amount of features while also being inexpensive, which was mentioned in the other article I sent you, there were 4. Four is more than 3, just so you know (see, I can be an overbearing prick too). Anyway. In places like West Virginia (where I'm currently going to college), Chromebooks are selling quite well, for families that can't afford much more. They occupy the bottom tier of laptops, which people just above or at the poverty line can just barely afford, and thus buy to have a computer they can use for day to day work.

KayBee236,AskWomen,1390243095.0,"I agree with you, but sometimes an SO's openness helps with healing. My SO and I have/had the same deal going on as Silvespooky, and it helped. I knew my mistrust was due to insecurity from past relationships and infidelity, and he wanted to try everything possible to help me through it while I also worked on myself. His willingness to provide me access to his phone showed me that, over time, he is consistent and honest, and I can count on what he says (in my past I have had many men tell me one thing then do the other). I've been dating him for over a year and stopped looking or caring about 3 months ago. I wasn't consistently checking his phone for the length of our relationship, but I would say the last time I looked was roughly 3 months ago.

I agree with you that it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When I found something ""suspicious"" I would talk to him about it, he would explain what it was, I would take some time to think it through, then I would come to the conclusion that it was my mind blowing it out of proportion. At first I used to stew over whatever I found, assuming the worst and eventually confronting him with tears and thinking we'd break up. Over time, coupled with his patience and understanding, I learned that the best course of action was for me to talk to him right away rather than let my insecurities feed the idea, and eventually the issue disappeared altogether.

I think the only way it works is if both parties try: the person with the mistrust must realize it's mostly in their head and actively and independently works on their insecurities, while the other person is willing, patient, and gentle.

Someone offering to let their SO look through their phone, email, etc. isn't necessarily the best course of action, but sometimes it does work."

Waldoz53,saudiarabia,1390243208.0,"Cool. I live in Aramco. So first off (this'll be very long), in the compound, there's a movie theater and bowling alley. There are 2 pools and 2 gyms. There's a few small restaurants in the compound. There's a golf club. There's a rugby club, biking clubs, running clubs. I think there's an Ultimate frisbee club, but I don't know how active it is. There's a BMX/skate park where kids sometimes hang out. There're a few Little League baseball fields, and if you're interested you could be a coach or an umpire or whatever. Since you probably won't have a car yet, there are buses that'll take you to the big malls in Dhahran/AL Khobar and all that.

Internet's pretty decent, and you're free to torrent anything (20Mb download speeds on the best days), though my personal experience with it is HORRIBLE, so I turned to STC. Cell phone service is fairly good. Again I use STC because there's an STC store in the compound. It should be fairly easy to keep in touch. Skype works fine as far as I know.

There's a lot more where that came from by the way. I know there's an adult softball ""league"" and there's a Dhahran Basketball Association, filled with adults and high school students.

Normally I go off to Bahrain about once every two months. It's not my thing. It's just bigger malls and more expensive stuff. Other than the Little League Baseball tourney in Dubai, I've only been there a few times. Too many people for me imo. Malls are way too packed though they are great malls.

Obviously it's going to take some time to adjust but you should have your basic stuff there soon after you arrive: phone, internet, TV. There's 2 big grocery stores in Aramco (and you have buses that'l take you there) so you don't have to go out and buy your groceries.

xtphr,Bitcoin,1390243334.0,"&gt; Bitcoin isn't about community. Crypto currency is not about community.

This is, I think, the biggest failure of crypto currencies before Dogecoin. Economics _absolutely_ is about community. All economies are a numerical representation of social activity. Like all social activity, you move or you die. If your economy is based on hoarding and speculation, you are setting yourself up for an epic crash. If your economy is constantly moving, you have a healthy economy. I'm not a Keynesian, but this is something the Keynesians have understood that the Austrians haven't. Whether it's redistribution through taxes, incentives for investments and spending, or whatever, you have to move your economy, and the more it moves the better.

There are [more dogecoin transactions per day](http://bitinfocharts.com/) than all the other cryptocoins _combined_. This is the sign of a healthy emergent economy, not the price of a single unit.

The dogecoin culture of tip/spend/donate is what it will base it's success on. Even if a single dogecoin never goes above $0.01, because long term viability has nothing to do with per-unit price."

cfedey,MonsterHunter,1390243496.0,"Unless you have an impossible amount of elemental damage, a Power Phial will always be a superior boost to damage. It's a 25% increase to Raw or Elemental, depending on the phial, so if you have more raw than elemental, power is always superior.

Here's an example I did real quick:

If you had a SA with 1000 Raw and 1300 Elemental (an impossible value), and used your weakest Sword attack (Sword side slash. Using a better attack would only increase the effectiveness of Raw damage.), on a hitzone with 50 raw weakness and 20 elemental weakness, you'd do the same damage regardless of if it was a Power or Elemental Phial. Those are the kind of numbers you need to have, and they're impossible.

If you used a realistic SA, like your Great Inceadeus with base 1058 raw, 170 water, and blue sharpness on a Barroth's muddy head (weakest water hitzone in the game, 22 Raw, 50 Water), and used the same Sword Side Slash attack, you'd do 25 damage with a Power Phial, and 24 damage with an Elemental Phial (hypothetically, since you can't have an elemental phial on this weapon). Even on a hitzone that's pretty resistant to slice attacks and very weak to water, Power Phial still comes out on top. Remember that stronger attacks will only increase the Raw damage, further making Power a better choice. Attack-boosting items, armor, food, etc. will also increase only the Raw damage."

Yep.  But things like APO, EPTS, and a few others have become less situational over time.  Part of that is just a change in balance and content too.

""Hey, let's put this squishy, farm, level, and snowball dependent character in the jungle and hope for the best!""

usually if i see a riven jungle i just have a field day she's so easy to bully and invade and if you set her behind early she's pretty much a sentient minion

if i'm not playing an aggressive invader/counterjungler I bring more utility to my team and generally have better ganks or teamfight (or both!) and she can't really do anything to me unless she brings the goon squad because her early in the jungle sucks so hard that I can duel her early game as someone like nautilus and not only win, but actually outright kill her.

If I'm in a proper position to countergank it's usually a double kill for us as well.

There's honestly nothing she can do that someone else can't do much better so I'm not afraid to fight her and get in her face because her answers to my attacks are all sub par unless I get too cocky and overcommit

The rivens I usually see start dorans blade in the jungle, which, after their potion, leaves them kind of low (or at least at a dangerous hp for early ganks) and that lack of health is often why i'm not afraid of them in the slightest- I have a huge durability advantage and i main junglers that have shields as well (udyr and nautilus respectively) as well as superior damage to her (udyr level 3 or 4 is very dangerous and come level 4 naut's DoT, auto reset, and lockdown forces her summoners and I can still beat the crap out of her after I hook her back)

she's also often forced to use jumps of her Q and her E to try and catch me so a lot of her damage is wasted, especially because she isn't able to use her auto frequently. And again, if she decides to gank early and i'm in position I'm usually close to full hp and she's at half so it usually fails horribly for them unless, as stated before, I screw up somehow."

While this does expose myself to some level of risk it doesn't in my mind expose myself to too much risk. The likelihood that I will burn through 3 months worth of cash at the same time as my stocks all being devalued down to 50% of my original investments is extremely slim and I have enough credit to give me 30 days to move money from investments to usable cash. This means that I could easily last 6 months with no income source even if there were some decent crashes in the stock market or another disaster. Then again I am young with no debts of any kind and I am currently not obligated to any contractual commitment for rent, cable, cell phone or any other kind of service so my expenses could do down in a heartbeat if they needed to.

""We'll search here,"" she said. I nodded. Mia let the net sink into the water. Its magic made the water glow. I closed my eyes and thought back to the fateful day, twenty years ago, when my husband's ship was taken by pirates and he was given his watery grave. He carried my pendant--the one I received from a sorceress when I was a child. The wearer was eternally youthful and given twice the benefits that come with young age. My husband needed it to make him strong for his trips overseas, but it was mine. I knew the pirates were fools who didn't realize the significance of the pendant, and had thus let it die with him. Every day since, I have come to this water, searching miles and miles of open sea, and bringing Mia along with me.

Mia held the rope and looked at the blue gem tied to the end, waiting for it to light up--signifying the net had found its prize. The magic for this net had cost all our savings, and a year of wages on top. Mia hated that blue gem. It had never lit up--not in twenty years. She looked up at me.

""Mother. Is it possible we ought to give this up?"" Her voice was timid. Without opening my eyes, I laughed.

""Stupid girl. Never."" I heard my daughter sigh then take a deep breath and began again.

""I--I'm leaving today,"" she said with more confidence. This surprised me and I looked at her immediately.

""What do you mean?""

""I'm running away with the blacksmith's son."" Her confidence grew. ""You have wasted years of my life on this frivolous quest, and I'll not do it any longer!""

""It cannot be,"" I said, but I was not looking at her. Her gaze followed my eyes to the gem in her hands, which, after twenty years, was glowing blue."

And then Microsoft isn't pushing out anything new.

So customers call up HP, and say ""what can I get with windows 7"", HP says ""unless you're a business customer, nothing"" and then customers just go somewhere else, or don't buy a computer.  

I certainly agree that  Windows 8 is causing support nightmares for anyone selling computers, but at least those people bought a computer.  I think HP and everyone else in the industry are getting very worried about the large collection of people who haven't bought computers or who are going to switch to macs, and that's a big problem.

prettyladythrowaway,asktransgender,1390244465.0,"&gt;Well, not that it's greatly relevant to me, personally, but empowering women, with women born women having top priority is not that terrible.

I mean it's just ineffective is all.  Since feminism is supposed to address the inequality of women.  Trans women are not equal, so that needs to be addressed.  You don't need to prioritize women born women to accomplish feminist goals.  And doing that would make it impossible to reach those goals.

&gt;But it doesn't have to meet our needs. Your cookie-cutter brand of feminism is okay at addressing transwomen's problems, all things considered. Complaining that this small group doesn't also bend head over heels for you is silly. Also, wot? It's desperation in that particular approval seeking scenario, not generally speaking. It's not an insult, it's a human emotion...

Nothing has to meet your needs, but it should because meeting the needs of oppressed minorities is what social justice is about.

You were using desperate to make the desire for accommodation seem less legitimate, that's what I took offense to.  

&gt;The point is that being a woman born woman and a being a transwoman are still different experiences no matter what. And I don't wanna be rude but yes, I feel that within the context of patriarchy and gender, the experience of a woman born and raised as a woman with a patriarchal definition of a woman gender applied to her, is more relevant to feminism than that of a man born and usually raised as a man, willingly adopting said definition of a woman gender, claiming to be ""the real deal"" based on said definition.

The point is not which experience is relevant, the point is confronting inequality of people based on gender.  It's not who's real and who's not.  It's who is oppressed and who is not.  

I think generally it's important to honor narratives, and that goes both ways between trans and cis women.  There is no real need to talk about who is real and who is not.  The oppression is real and that's what counts.

Your point would only be true if trans women had a better position in society than cis women, which we clearly do not.  "

That cat died alone and terrified because that shitbag of a human being was inconvenienced. Mincing words and pretending that is not the best case scenario of what happened to that cat isn't doing OP any favors. She needs to confront the reality of what this person actually did before she decides whether or not she wants this person to remain in her life. 

What he did was callous, selfish and awful. Cats are sentient beings and while they are not human beings, they experience the same emotions we do. Their emotions are more intense in many cases because they lack understanding of the situations we put them in. This cat had no idea what was going on--all she knew that she was alone and afraid and her people weren't there with her. That is how her life ended. That is how most cats who are euthanized die--terrified and in a scary place with strange people. In many cases, it's to ease their suffering due to illness and age but in this case, it was because this guy was tired of watching someone else clean up cat shit.

For the record, I'm a software engineer, I started applying for jobs around 6 months before finishing my degree because I was told about this slowness. It was important for me to find a job as soon as I graduated because I wasn't doing so great financially.

Watch the men sometime and yes they are hitting with a lot of power but they are also playing with a ton of skill and moving guys around the court so that they can hit a winner, or a guy like Nadal who can be on the dead run defensively and barely get to a shot but still turn it into a winner.

On Wikipedia I also found that 95% of child sexual abuse incidents are committed by the 88% of child molesters who aren't actually pedophiles.

So the question here is what you mean by ""many"" pedophiles acting on their urges. If it's anywhere near half of them then a very large portion of the male population would be child molesters. Hell, even if it's only 1/4 of the pedophiles who act on their urges that's still an awful lot of non-pedophiles molesting kids (and 3/4 pedophiles not molesting kids).

I just think you (and many others) are overreacting. That doesn't mean I think we should let people molest kids, just that there's a lot of unnecessary panic when it comes to pedophiles."

Chaos_Spear,AskReddit,1390245197.0,"From http://www.ibtimes.com/yelp-extortion-rampant-say-small-business-owners-class-action-lawsuit-against-review-bully-appealed
&gt;Critics both in and out of the courtroom continue to go to great lengths to characterize Yelp as an unscrupulous bully, bent on wielding its influence to extort advertising revenue from small businesses on the receiving end of the countless negative rants by Yelp users. In their lawsuit, the merchants claim that Yelp offers to hide negative reviews and highlight positive ones in exchange for advertising purchases. Some merchants have also accused Yelp of zapping positive reviews as retribution for businesses that don’t advertise.

I'll admit, it's not exactly a smoking gun.  I've met a lot of small business owners who have had the same experience though.

The problem is, if it is true, it's nearly impossible to prove, without a very deep audit, or someone from Yelp stepping forward to testify against them."

OriginalStomper,atheism,1390245330.0,"&gt;God is not provable... 

Sure.  Every religion I have ever heard of starts with the tenet that *faith* is an essential element.  Objective [dis]proof would moot the need for faith.

&gt;Philosophical evidence standards are ""I think""... That's it. So think what ever you want, but it ain't true

 If you define ""truth"" so that the term is limited to ""things established empirically,"" then of course empiricism prevails and philosophy is a waste of time.  That's called a ""tautology.""

Philosophical proofs require that assumptions be clearly identified, but the logic applied to them is rigorous.  Empiricism starts with some shared assumptions and relies on evidence that meets empirical standards, then settles for the most likely explanation rather than proof.  That's not a criticism -- one of empiricism's strengths lies in its willingness to discard (or modify) the old theory in favor of the new.  But it is only possible because Empiricism is a series of approximations rather than logical absolutes."

But, being a Suns fan, I still made a 12 minute video of his highlights, and I wanted to share this because I bet a lot of people here don't really know who he is/haven't seen him play.

IMO, he's one of the most underpaid players in the league. $884K gives you a player who can space the floor, run in transition, defend the opposing team's best wing scorer and grab rebounds. 

In the video, I mostly emphasized his on-ball defense (against players such as Melo, Harden, J-Smoove, Gay, Durant, Kobe, etc.), his hustle, and his corner shooting.

Women are the gatekeepers of sex and men are the gatekeepers of relationships so for a woman to sleep around  sends a red flag to guys that she isn't relationship material. 

For men, having many sexual partners means he has high status and sexual market value because it is not so easy for a man to have many sexual partners and which ever woman a man decides to have a relationship with must be of high status or value which is why women are attracted to men who are in relationships because they know that those men have something to offer."

Scoring and yards are completely separate and scoring is arguably a better indicator of the potency of the defense or offense. Yards are typically used since they can be compared and Defense-adjusted easier. Check out DVOA and DYAR. Then check out scoring defense and offense.

They are completely separate and the title is still both true and super relevant. Teams that lead the lead in yards aren't always the best scoring defense/offense. The 2010 Chargers had the #1 defense and offense by yards, but didn't make the playoffs because their scoring offense and defense was average and special teams was dead last in the league."

EDIT: ""Tourism"" is indeed referring to the National Harbor, largely because of the fact that the MGM Grand is going to be located there within a few years. Yes, the National Harbor hasn't turned out like it had originally been planned to, but it's a definite value-add when considering everything else that's going on there. Which apparently now includes pot tourism. If they decide to take up that Baltimore-DC maglev line that Japan is proposing to help finance, that'll just be icing. 

The biggest problem the region faces is largely psychological: people from the other side of the metro area who absolutely love to dog-whistle their disdain for MD's rural white and suburban black populations, which indirectly leads to stymied development. However, location is location, and ultimately NoVa (with its ongoing civil war with the rest of the state) won't be able to compete with Eastern/Central Maryland's being smack dab in the middle of the Northeast Corridor (See: Richmond vs Charlottesville)."

HippieSpider,DotA2,1390245926.0,"&gt; Please explain how exactly you calculated your results. Is Storm level 6 or level 25 in your calculations?

I think I the calculations are explained in the post if I'm not mistaken.

If not, I just used the mana regen formula from the DotA 2 wiki and applied it to a level 25 Storm Spirit with nothing but the item in question for each row to find the net Mana Regen a Storm Spirit would have with that item and nothing else. The formula then calculates the mana lost per second by Storm for his ulti knowing that the ulti costs 10 mana + 1% of his maximum manapool per unit and that he travels at 2700 units per second with his level 3 ulti (don't quote me on that, I'm too lazy to go check the exact value right now).

Finally, since I now know the mana lost and the mana gained per second, I find the total net mana per second that Storm has while ultying (simply regen-degen), and divide it by his manapool to figure out how long a level 25 Storm would be able to ulti for with that item.

&gt; According to your table, a Diffusal Blade 2 (+10 int) gives Storm a higher travel distance than a Rod of Atos (+25 int). Something is wrong here, I assume that you accidently swapped the agi/int values of Diffusal.

Someone else pointed out the Diffusal vs. Atos comparison, and I'm not sure what causes it too. If I were to guess, I would simply say that the intelligence does not give enough mana regen at level 25 without any % based items for it to be efficient, as it stands it simply makes the 1% manacost larger while not giving enough total mana to make up for that.

I strongly encourage you to take a look at the spreadsheet itself and check for any errors yourself.

&gt; It is also very hard for me to believe that an Iron Branch gives me a higher travel distance than a Sage's Mask or a Vladmir's Offering (0.8 flat mana/s). Did you assume that Storm has no base Intelligence when you did your calculations?

As I said, the calculation is made for those items and nothing else in Storm's inventory. I guess this would have to be what causes this kind of strange result. Not sure.

&gt; Sorry for sounding like a dick, no hard feelings!

Ok,  I should point out I'm not a marine biologist or an expert on sharks by any measure. Like I said above, I just happened to know that male sharks have claspers and that the shark in the picture doesn't *appear* to have any. However, it's hard to tell from the picture, so *I could be wrong on that count.* And the comments from actual marine biologists in the thread seem to be leaning towards the shark being male, but having really small or undeveloped claspers due to it being a child, although there's some flip-flopping.

I think we should leave it in as a roo, because most people would be unaware that the shark *may* not be male, and even if they are aware, they'll probably be unsure, unless they happen to be a marine biologist specialising in sharks who're on Reddit *and* are actually opening up the image to look at instead of glancing at the thumbnail, which is very unlikely. And even then, they'll probably agree that it's male but undeveloped.

So, to sum up, probably 99.99999% of people won't find anything wrong with the roo, and it seems silly to delete it based on *maybe* the shark being the wrong gender.

**TL;DR** I think we should keep the roo, since the general consensus in the thread is that the shark is male, that's what people will assume anyway, and I've sorta changed my own mind after zooming in on the pic and looking at it for 5 minutes."

TheToastofBotswana,unitedkingdom,1390246223.0,"I went through the eleven plus in the early 90s (Northern Ireland) and I think it was good thing overall. I ended up going to a grammar. In my school there was no streaming. I'm not sure whether that was practised at other schools but it was nice that everyone was on an equal footing. It had its downsides though. Like most grammars it was a bit stuck in the 50's and had a ridiculous set of rules. Things like not wearing your blazer, even when outside the school grounds, would earn you a ""demerit"". It also stuck to classical academic subjects (compulsory Latin for the first 3 years for example) and I ended up leaving at 16 and going to a technical college because they didn't offer computing at A-level.

To me, the eleven plus exam itself was fairly easy. We spent a large portion of primary 7 practising for it though. By the time the test came around there were no surprises on what grades everyone would get. For that reason I didn't feel much pressure about it but I think it was stupid that much of a school year was wasted practising for an exam."

sir_sri,technology,1390246281.0,"&gt;On an SSD

Windows 7 is just as fast as windows 8.  I agree that migrating an existing windows 7 machine to an SSD is inconvenient but if you're installing from scratch its' not a big deal.  I've got 3 windows 7 machines I migrated to SSD's.  

&gt; I dont use a touch screen either. Just boot to desktop and its almost exactly the same. It boots faster too.

You must have the most minimal requirements in computing history.  I have a windows 8 surface pro 2 I use for lecturing (CS).  The Screens on the Surface pro 2 are by far the best in the industry for writing on, which makes it great for the class who can actually read stuff I scrawl... subject to constraints imposed by my handwriting.  

But because of the way the metro apps don't close unless you configure them to, the touch screen doesn't always recognize gestures, etc. etc. etc. etc. it just doesn't work very well.  For my rather minimal requirements in class of opening up powerpoint, writing all over it, saving, repeating the process it gets the job done. But even if you turn off metro and go to an application list it is prohibitively difficult to find things that go with applications (like say shortcuts to manuals), and while conceptually the idea of integrating bing search into the search isn't a bad idea, windows search still doesn't work worth shit.  

It means that windows 8's UI ends up being more like a command line driven experience, where you have to search for everything, because you cannot find anything unless you know the proper names for things, and you cannot know the proper names for things (which are different from Windows 7 in a lot of cases) unless you have already found them.  

Oh and it's horribly inconsistent about which UI it wants you using.  8.1 is better and you can configure it better, and installing any of the tools from  Stardock help a lot but out of the box Windows 8 is a disaster.  "

Daiteach,studyroomf,1390246556.0,"Jeff is also, for better or for worse, the main character of the show in a lot of ways. It's certainly an ensemble cast, but Jeff is more central and closer to the show's point of view than the others more of the time. The season one pilot opens with Jeff. The season five repilot opens with Jeff. He's positioned, usually implicitly, but sometimes explicitly, as the leader. There are many episodes where he's not the *hero*, but taken as a whole the series is about a lawyer who got busted and the people he meets and forms bonds with. All of the characters move through the story circle in some fashion, but Jeff's the one who does it most often and is arguably doing it most directly in the big picture sense. On a storytelling level, Jeff changes because the show is about capturing the window of time in which Jeff is changing.

That said, I don't think that Shirley exists entirely outside of or unmoving on the story circle (from a big picture perspective - she moves around it in some episodes, although rarely, because the show rarely makes her the protagonist of any of the subplots.) Some secondary characters in the show do exist as more static entities: for example, I don't think the show is about the Dean changing. (That's not meant as a knock to how the character is written or how Jim Rash plays him - both are excellent. It's just that that's how nonprotagonists tend to work.)

I don't really know that I'd consider *either* of ""Shirley learns to keep her mouth shut"" or ""Shirley abandons her convictions"" to really qualify as remotely satisfying ""growth"" for the character. I feel like the tenor of a lot of this thread bends towards the idea that growth for the character just involves her becoming more like ""us"", in terms of worldview. Shirley having some experience that makes her pro-choice represents a shift in her political beliefs, and it's a shift that makes them more like ""our"" political beliefs, but human growth and character growth isn't just the process of becoming more like /u/Daiteach."

I'd been running my whole life.

I was pretty sure I'd known that for a while now. Like, I'd started ""knowing"" that a few months ago, maybe even a whole year now? It had been a thing I'd realized over time. 

I guess I'd been looking at the pieces before to escape from the whole before. If you put the pieces together, the truth was obvious, but I'd held them piece by piece, and my life was all the emptier for it. But... I'd escaped by focusing on the pieces. When I even focused on them at all, that is.

The cross dressing. Well, maybe I was just a cross dresser. That's a little weird, but it was an easier revelation to swallow than the truth. The discomfort with my body. Well, maybe I just had some self-image issues. This was easy to swallow, fucking everyone had some of those, right? I was uncomfortable with any strong form of being ""manly"", despite not minding a lot of masculine things. Well, maybe I was just open minded about my interests. That wasn't just easy to swallow, it was practically an easy point of pride.

And, in focusing on the pieces like that, they didn't add up to anything at all. After all, you could be a guy who was a cross dresser with some body image issues and be open minded and disinterested in stereotypically masculine things. 

The truth, after all, lay in the connections, not the individual pieces of the puzzle. And the truth was that these were all part of the same thing.

I was *not* comfortable with being a guy. My body wasn't just something I disliked, I really honestly had never been comfortable in my skin. My dislike for traditionally masculine activities had always, *always* stemmed from the fact that they were associated with being ""guyish"", not because I just disliked them. The cross dressing had always made me feel a little better about my body, and it had been associated with fantasies of actually just... well, just being comfortable. Just being a girl.

It hadn't been a ""fun"" activity. It had been an activity I needed. An activity I couldn't stop. 

Hell, I'd even tried, once or twice. I just... couldn't do it. I hated those times. 

Yeah, if you put them together, it was obvious to see, but I'd held them piece by piece, and my life was all the emptier for it.

But... But until I'd gone off to college, I'd never let myself do that. I'd cross dressed secretly, narrowly avoiding getting caught. A few weeks into the first quarter here, though, and I'd started to really, honestly question.

I think I knew the truth within a week of that. And yet, here I sat, on my bed, on this last day before finals, wondering. 

""wondering."" I whispered out loud, and then allowed myself a small, sarcastic laugh at my own expense.

*What is there left to ask? I think the conclusion is obvious.* I admitted to myself, *I don't think I can say 'I don't know' this time around.*

I let out a deep breath.

*Yeah. I'm transgender.*

That admission was hard.

After I'd made it, there were three sets of feelings that set upon me.

1) A feeling of hope for the future: a dream, a goal that I had: To be able to express myself as a woman at some future point in my life.

2) A feeling of fear for the future: With this new realization, I knew that either I would aim to fulfill the goals I now knew I had, or I would suffer. But I would suffer some either way. While being a trans person who didn't realize that was terribly hard in this world, being a trans person who did realize they were trans wasn't exactly an easy road to hoe. I'd read up on other trans people's stories. At best, they'd had to face up to people that disapproved of them and made their life more difficult. At worst, they were rejected by family members, or faced hate crimes of various degrees. 

3) A feeling of slight uncertainty. This was the most painful emotion, although it was also the subtlest. Even with all the certainty I had, I could never be fully certain, and I knew that. What if I was wrong? What if I was just psychotic? What if the transphobic people of the world that said people like me had chosen our fate were right? Sure, I didn't believe that, but I wasn't so stupid or so arrogant as to believe with absolute certainty that my view of the world was correct. It seemed unlikely to me that I was wrong, but I found it frustrating that I could not have absolute certainty. This was huge step, and the fact that, ultimately, I still had to make it like I made every other decision, relying on my own ability to perceive the world correctly, was very frustrating.

I thought the answer to my questioning would be enough when I started questioning, but now I had a whole new set of questions and emotions to untangle. Was I going to be OK? What if I was wrong? What if I was right? Wouldn't it be a wonderful world if I could have what I wanted? How long would it take me to get hormones? How could I get access to them? Who would I come out to, and how? Did I want surgery? If so, when? How would I gather the funds? What if I never passed? What if the school wasn't too keen on my transition? What if some professor wasn't too keen on my transition? Who would I come out to first?

So many questions. But this time, I was fairly sure none of them would take a year to answer.

I allowed myself to answer one more question that day, the last one I asked. My roommate had been pretty supportive through this, and I'd confided in him a lot about myself along the way. 

Later that evening, I walked up to him, and, my heart beating a hundred miles a minute, I said 

""I've... got something  I need to say.""

""Yes, Alex?""

Alex. It wasn't a terrible name; a girl could theoretically have it, although that was another new question for me: Would I keep my name, or change it? If I changed it, what would I change it to? I was obviously going to have to change my legal name, as that was 'Alexander', which was an obviously masculine name.

I paused, having trouble spitting the words out, ""I'm transgender."" I said, ""That's the conclusion I've come to after thinking about some of the things I told you about before.""

I'd been drunk when I'd told him those things, but he hadn't told anybody.

He smiled, nodded, and said, ""I assume this is a secret for now.""

I nodded, ""I'm not ready to tell everybody yet.""

(That's where I'll end this piece. The ""Coming to terms with being trans"" realization is a kind of a fun thing to write, because it's *very* emotional and powerful and I think it fit the prompt to a T. Also, this is basically unedited, so I hope it doesn't have any huge sentence errors in it!)"

With Obama being the last one riding around on his mechanized war scooter. The mighty Putin, after knocking out nearly 57 national leaders figures to save the best for last and take out the pesky Japanese. Putin immediately rushes the Japanese mech and is caught unawares by the agility of the metal beast. The Japanese mech lets off a barrage of heavy munitions rounds on Putin, by the mighty king of bears on which puti is riding rears up on his his legs and absorbs the fire with his thick skin that seems to be made of steal. The mech suddenly stops, with and falls over as a giant cloud of bald eagles took out the Japanese leader held inside. Two are left, the mighty Putin, and the crafty Obama. Obama, on his stallion of American badass steel rush towards Putin and his bear. The two collide with a thundering ring, beast and steel deadlocked together the sound of gears crunching and sinews snapping in an attempt to overpower the other. But Obama has one more trick up his sleeve. From the middle of his scooter a giant missile fires off right into the heart of the noble bear, with a final growl the bear rips the scooter in half rendering it unusable, but the blast from the missile was too much for the bear and it takes it's final breath. Putin and Obama are standing in the middle of the arena like two heavyweight boxers. Putin throws the first jab, but Obama quickly jerks his head out of the way. It is the classic battle of Russian power vs American agility. Putin rears back his great fist in an attempt to knock out Obama with one blow. But again Obama avoids the massive fist. In a counter attack Obama gets 3 quick jabs I to the stomach of Putin. Putin says that he had been awaiting a fight like this for some time. There they are, the only two leaders left in the world in the championship match of the world. Winner takes all. When all of a sudden a giant white light comes down from the sky, and in enters a new foe, upon seeing the new challenger both of the final leaders bow down at the foot of the final foe. From the remnants of the great battle, Chuck Norris with his fists of steel and beard of the gods gladly accepts the resignation of the two leaders. Thus ends the tale of how Chuck Norris became the worlds first supreme leader, also known as the 150 years reign of chuck Norris.

n88888888,WritingPrompts,1390246912.0,"Diary,

This is the point in the story where conflict is about to arise. I can feel it. It is bubbling in my veins with every word he writes. Closer, and closer, and closer, we move in upon a new chapter. A new chapter of my life. As you can imagine, this is riveting. Truly compelling. 

I hope my author writes a good nights sleep into my plot, because if I were to be left to decide, I wouldn’t be able to sleep a wink!


Diary,

We’re not quite to the conflict yet, but that’s okay! These things take time. 

I’ll focus on the good. Today, I was introduced to another girl. She has just recently moved into the dorm room across from mine. Perhaps a minor detail, but still one that may lead to more. We’ll know once we get there.

As for me, well, I’m deciding if it would be alright to go talk to her. I know that I should leave that up to the author, but I’d like to get to know my neighbors! Sure, I’m a character in a book, but we have to have a life once you close the pages too, you know! I mean, we’re in a few classes together, too. The ones I really like, since the author made me a Bachelor of Science student. We could study together, and maybe talk about our interests and stuff like that.

Anyways, I’ll sleep much better tonight, I trust. I’m not so wound up for change to happen. Plus, I’m distracted by the new girl.


Diary,

I did it! I went over to talk to her. I’m so glad I did! Her name is Abbatha. She’s a little taller than me, black hair, fair skin, athletic. She’s a runner. She is doing a Bachelor of Arts, but she’s thinking of switching, we’re not sure, the author hasn’t decided. But anyways, she likes a lot of the same things as I, so I think we’ll be good friends. The author must have decided to do this on purpose. I don’t have any friends or family that are close to me, so I’m excited for this change.

On a side note, I ran into a football player who takes a few classes with me this morning on my way back to my room. He introduced himself and we talked for a while. He seems like a bit of an idiot, your typical football player. I really, really hope this isn’t intended to be a romantic interest for me. I didn’t think it was *that* kind of a book, with predictable characters and the generic, dumb, even more predictable match up with the geek and jock. Happened already, sorry author!

Anyways, here is to hoping that he is just a small character who has little to nothing to do with me. Could I be that lucky? We’ll see.


Diary,

*It’s worse than I’ve imagined!* I can’t *believe* the author would do this. 
I walked into my room today, and there was Abby (the author changed her name since 'Abbatha always comes up with a red underline', he said). I was all, hey whats up, and she kisses me! She walks right up to me, puts her hands behind my head and kisses me. And I’m supposed to just be okay with that? Did the author ask if I was a lesbian? Or is it okay for him to be chauvinistic and couple us together like we’re animals for his pleasure.  

And *she* seemed to be fine with going along with it. Anyways, luckily, the author at least wrote in an acceptable reaction. I freak out and run to a bench outside. She stays in the dorm. Then the football player approaches and asks whats up. What was his name anyways, I didn’t write it down a few days ago. Peter? Yes, Peter!

So Peter is kind enough to talk to me about it, if you could call it kind- he really does not like people attracted to the same-sex. I almost regret telling him, but the author wrote that part in, so there wasn’t much I could do about it anyways. I’m a little worried he may call Abby out on it in class, she ended up switching to a Bachelor of Science after all. 

I feel like I lost a good friend. Perhaps I’ll go talk to Abby later this evening. I mean, I guess I’m just scared. You think that it would be easy if this stuff was written in, like it was meant to be and out of your control. I’m beginning to think being a character isn’t that different from being an author. 


Diary,

I talked to Abby, but not before talking to myself. I played around with the idea of Peter and I dating. I wouldn’t be happy. He wouldn’t let me stay friends with Abby, and I didn’t want to be with someone so narrow minded. I also don’t find myself to be attracted to him. I re-read some diary entries, and realized how much detail I had put into my descriptions of Abby. I hardly mentioned Peters name. 

So I got up the courage to go knock on her door. She answered, make-up running down her face. We weren’t being written into the novel, so I knew these tears were real. It almost felt like it was being written, though. 
I stepped into her room, closed the door behind me, and kissed her. Like, really kissed her. It was natural, I just did it. I felt her tongue in my mouth, her soft breathing hoarse from tears, her body wrap around mine. It was so gorgeous. I almost wish the author had have been there so he could have written this in. It was like it was straight out of a fairytale, minus the straight part!

I’ll see what the author has in store for us, perhaps it was just a kiss and then she fades into the sea of university students who barely have a role other than to fill the extra rooms in these dorms. I hope she doesn’t. I’ll seek her out when I’m not being written if I have to. I’d do anything to see her again.


Diary,

So it wasn’t a kiss then onto missing her! 
The author had discovered I had been seeing her outside of his writing- we kept giggling when he was trying to write the scene we had acted out on our own last night! He sat down with us and let us know this wouldn’t be easy, but he was prepared to keep us together in the story. That was his plan, after all.
	
He told us that this isn’t easy, but he’s glad we chose it for ourselves and it wasn’t 100% decided on because of what he had written. He told us what it was like to be a gay character, and how it would change everything at least in a minor sense. He had told us that Peter was a nice guy, but had a family who didn’t raise him to be accepting. We were told to expect trouble from a few of the football characters, but to seek refuge in a star member of the team who was gay, but battling between his football life and personal life. He also told us to get used to each other, we were an item he wasn't prepared to break up any time soon. He winked, so I think she may be the one! 

So, diary, there is another crazy day as a character in one of the authors stories. I understand now, that feelings and emotions are as much ours as a part of the author. We are an extension, but in many ways influence the author himself. I was initially made to fall in love with the football star, but was taken another way because of what the author saw in me. I'm as much my own person as him, and we are able to play off of each other. I'm writing the book, he is writing the book, Abby is writing the book. We're emotions, fragments of being that live in another universe, and a space inside the authors mind, pen and life.

Perhaps, we deserve our names on the cover, too.

I don't want to try to speak for religious people, but that's how it seems to me, at least.

I agree that growth for the character is likely to be much more satisfying if it comes in the form of the character's faith being part of what informs positive change, rather than the character just learning a lesson that she shouldn't have convictions or shouldn't express them."

sir_sri,technology,1390247163.0,"&gt; It doesn't matter what the OS is.

Sure it does.  That's critical.  It reduces computer buying to absolutely necessary replacements rather than trying to experience new tech.  That slows down the general churn and replacement rate.  Sure, this computer is slow, but if I buy a new one I have to get windows 8, I can cope with slow until windows 9  sort of thing.  If the computer dies then you have to buy.  The Car industry faces kind of the same thing.  Most 'muricans buy a new car every few years because they want a new one, not because the old one has been  destroyed in a crash or rusted to oblivion - that happens too.  But keeping that discretionary churn rate high by new designs and marketing campaigns is a big part of the  business.  

&gt;' And any salesman can just click the classic desktop button

Which doesn't solve the issues in windows 8 unfortunately, because it really wants to take you to 'metro'.

&gt;That being said, I'm sure Microsoft/HP could make a better introductory program for whenever you activate a new computer/OS.

They have one in windows 8.1, that they need it at all is a testament to how bad a job they did. 

&gt;If HP would actually make their products and prices more competitive instead 

They are.  Well, relative to any of the other big system builders who are becoming rarer and rarer, as the market splits to business desktops. gaming desktop, build your own, and then business guys who also shovel some garbage to home users for next to nothing.  

&gt;, but to be honest windows 8 isn't what is driving HP sales down

Windows 8 is driving down sales in the entire industry actually.  If HP tried to go full ~~retard~~ windows 8 back in october they would have seen their sales plummet relative to say, Dell, who actually boosted  their Windows 7 offerings at that point.  

If people don't want computers there's only so much HP can do, but if you want a computer and you have a choice of say Dell or HP, and Dell offers you something you do want, and  HP something you don't for essentially the same price, well, you can see HP's problem.  "

You cannot change an OEM license, because it's not a typical ""key"" - it activates via the BIOS and certificates, not online in any way.

If you want to activate with MAK or KMS keys, you need to acquire them as part of a volume licensing deal with Microsoft.  The purchase price of KMS or MAK licensing brings you reimaging rights (which you do not actually have outside of a VL agreement for the product you're reimaging, by the way).  Also, if you purchase SA, you get training, version independence (both upwards and downwards within the supported version structure), home use, access to MDOP, and a few other support-related niceties.

If the business is happy purchasing retail software or just using what ships on the machine as far as licensing is concerned, that's fine, but you have to be careful about the limitations of that approach - mainly, management time IT will have to spend because they lack the rights to do certain things and still be in compliance with the licensing agreement, but this also dovetails into whether or not the business would benefit from the additional things VL+SA would bring, at the additional cost."

The second, and *far* more important reason is because I hate playing with 3-man and 4-man premades.  The amount of rage and blame far exceeds anything I see in ranked queues.  Too, people tend to give up far too quickly in normals.  

So, my solution has been to have a smurf account that I use to learn new things in a ranked environment.

eighthgear,anime,1390247501.0,"After a bit of a slow start, I'd say that Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta is beginning to not only meet my expectations, but exceed them. This episode was easily the best so far - in fact, I'd say that every episode has been an improvement over the last. The pacing was superb - delivering a mix of both training, character interactions, and that great, great backstory. I was a bit worried that Karl's history would be delivered to the viewers in bits and drabs, despite the fact that it was pretty easy to guess after the second episode. Instead, they delivered what I presume to be the bulk of it in one go, which not only made the scenes quite emotionally powerful, but it also means that we should be getting some present-time character development in the upcoming episodes.

The ending of the episode - with Karl and Clair separated and on the water - does remind me a bit of [Toaru Hikuushi e no Tsuioku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9000/Toaru_Hikuushi_e_no_Tsuioku), of which The Pilot's Love Song is a spin-off of.

Other Cool Sci-Fi:

**Aim for the Top!! Gunbuster** -- Only sci-fi anime I know of that deals with the effects of [](#s ""Time Dilation""). I find the first three and a half episodes to be pretty boring, but those last two and a half episodes? SO good.

**Akira** -- Along with GitS, this was highly influential in bringing anime to the west. 

**Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise** -- Story of the first manned space flight in an alternate universe. Pay close attention to the ""technology"", stuff like money, eating utensils, that sort of thing.

**Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou** -- A nice slice-of-Post-Apocalyptic-life. Follows an android that runs a cafe in the Japanese country side, and the people she meets. Fantastic animation, great soundtrack, and the manga is even better.

POST EPISODE THOUGHTS: These past two episodes of Witch Craft Works have impressed me by their ability to deliver a variety of scenes without seeming rushed or garbled together in a hasty manner. Last week's episode managed to fit in effective dialogue-based expeditionary scenes as well as contain two interesting action sequences, and whilst the first Tower Witch attack in this week's episode might remind one of Team Rocket in terms of their lack of competence (seriously - their plan was to charge straight at Kagari?), the rest of the episode gave enough time to the Schwarz confrontation (which was very nicely animated) to allow for some good character interactions whilst still having enough time left for the training scenes. The pacing of the series has been excellent, with few moments feeling drawn-out. Another part of the show that I have enjoyed is the character design - all of the Tower Witches have very unique costumes, and this distinctiveness can help the viewer identify the different witches from each other even if the viewer can't quite remember their names.

A lot of people probably were turned off of the show due to the somewhat questionable CG in the first episode, and the series so far is definitely far from perfect - the protagonist is still mostly useless, some of his decisions are hard to understand, Kagari is perhaps a bit too OP, the idea that pretty much everyone else in the school hates Takamiya is a bit annoying, and it would help to see some competence on the part of the Tanpopo and Ai's respective cliques - but overall, I am definitely much more into Witch Craft Works now than I was after finishing its first episode. I certainly hope that it can maintain this level of quality for the rest of its run.

sir_sri,technology,1390247867.0,"&gt;Do you think this is worse on the large scale than when they rolled out Vista?

For the industry it has been far worse. 

There's two separate things here.  How bad is windows 8 and how bad to people perceive it to be.  I'm happy to argue until I'm blue in the face about how terrible windows 8 is, including with some of my former students who are at microsoft on the development team.  But whether it is bad or not, people perceive it to be bad, and so are holding off on buying until they hear good things.  

The perception of it being bad, or even just the risk that it's bad and people are waiting on replacing computers.  

&gt;I mean, windows 8 can be annoying

I think it depends what you do with the computer, and how much time you want to spend configuring it and so on.  Vista worked a lot like XP with but with a very overzealous user account control and it was kinda slow.  Windows 8 (and 8.1) is a giant inconsistent mess of interaction, but then, if it does the  things you want to do well - browse pictures, run a small collection of programs on a daily basis etc. then it can get the job done, that kind of thing (I actually really like the music app in general) you can see where they want to go with the user experience and it might not be bad.

There's also the windows 7/windows 9 problem - which is that with vista you could see how it could be great, and MS did that with windows 7.  With 8... they could go a lot of different ways some of which would be complete trainwrecks and until we start seeing windows 9 it is hard to know what is going to happen.  "

conspirized,MensRights,1390247918.0,"My son's mother is a perfect example of this. Two years ago I was told by lawyers that I would be wasting my money to hire them because her and I were never married, so I'm not entitled to any rights and I'm at her mercy.

A year ago she raised my child support to over $400 a month, then continued to expect me to take care of my son full time.

She violated the custody agreement and moved out of state with my son for 6 months. I filed her in contempt of court, but it accomplished nothing for me because I can't force her to move back.

When she did move back, she still continued to keep my son from me unless I did some kind of favor for her, it was a weekly thing. She had a new boyfriend, see, and he provided her with all the drugs in the world and she felt it necessary to keep my son from me in order to preserve custody and because... ya know... her boyfriend had her constantly armed and ready for an argument with me.

In current events she's an addict and she's homeless. I still pay her over $400 a month in child support, and my son lives with me full time. She doesn't even see him. I'm not eligible for government assistance of any kind because the welfare case is in her name and she's the legal guardian (admittedly if I weren't paying her child support I wouldn't even want / need it).

Now I'm looking at hiring a lawyer and, on the plus side, I've actually scored a consultation so my case might not be entirely hopeless, but I'm going to have to come up with thousands of dollars to pay to secure custody from his homeless, druggie mother and I have to do it before she fucks her way into a new home and it goes back to my son witnessing her next boyfriend abuse the shit out of her 5 days a week... again. If she makes it into a ""permanent"" residence before I can get her into a courtroom all hope is lost for gaining custody of my son because... you guessed it... I have a penis and we weren't married.

This isn't even HALF the shit. She can show up with the cops and take my son from me anytime, even if our current custody agreement says he's supposed to be with me. She has done this SEVERAL times simply because she was pissed I wouldn't give her money, give her a ride to get drugs, etc. I can file her in contempt of court, but again it goes nowhere. I've been documenting shit for almost 5 YEARS and as of a year ago I still didn't have a case to take custody.

Right, so check yourself. you obviously do want to cheat. reevaluate your relationship, a year and a half really isn't that long. maybe you should put a hold on your engagement until you know wether or not you can put this behind you, and in the mean time... stop hanging out with the hot dude.

phaqueue,woweconomy,1390247947.0,"honestly - I've been doing this with JC since like TBC or so... (prospecting ore and selling gems and such) there is a level of RNG, but if you're prospecting the amount of ore that most of these people are, the averages tend to work themselves out over time. Really - when I'm doing the shuffle, the bulk of my blue gems sell for roughly the same amount, so it doesn't matter which ones I get. The only ones that don't sell as well are the blue ones, and I use those for daily research for now. 

There are plenty of tools to use to figure out if it's possible, and it's really not as much RNG as you think (unless you're only doing small amounts, then the RNG might hit you harder sometimes)

Enchanting can make you some easy money both of buying things from the AH to DE and also in selling the enchants. 

My scribe (thank you for being one of the few people who actually correctly says scribe.. instead of the tons of other things they get called) has made me probably 20-30k gold over the last month or so since I finished leveling it to max (so I don't have all the patterns yet even, still working on getting them all). Inscription is also cheaper to level than most of the other professions when just buying straight from AH - when leveling inscription, each ""step"" has multiple different herbs you can choose from to get the pigment you need, and there's usually some cheap one at each level you can use.

I honestly don't suggest, whatever you choose, that you get into prolonged debates with your family about what you believe. *Sometimes* it's possible to get people to think about their beliefs through conversation, but the vast majority of the time it's just a frustrating exercise in futility. 

I'm not saying never try, but don't pin all your hopes on being able to convince your family that it's BS and therefore you're making a sound decision to leave - they just won't believe that.

For now, I'd strongly urge you to try and find some sort of livable balance for the time being, while you focus on making sure you have a life outside the JW's: prepared for work, friends, education, career, social life, etc…

The Witcher I. The Witcher II has since become more popular, but the first game is still very fun, well fleshed out RPG. Because of a point-and-click combat style however, again, it is less popular.

The Thief games are a very popular series that you may not have played due to their age. However, their gameplay and story really still stand the test of time, even if the graphics leave something to be desired.

I saw you mentioned you hadn't played Katawa Shoujo before, so I'm going to assume you haven't played many visual novels. There are absolutely tons of this type of game available, with a range of different genres and gameplay. /r/visualnovels is nice.

I'm assuming it is something more akin to the [English Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War) than the [Russian Revolution.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution) The English Civil War saw the deposition of the monarchy, but England retained its aristocracy (indeed, many ""Roundhead"" rebels were aristocrats). We aren't talking about a complete work-over of the political structure, like what happened in Russia with the rise of Communism. Though I agree that the Wind Revolution was far more coup-like than anything. It wasn't really a Civil War, like what happened in England.

Republicanism and aristocracy are not mutually exclusive. Besides England during the interregnum (the period after the Parliamentary victory in the Civil War and before the restoration of the monarchy, though that ""Commonwealth"" soon became a Protectorate, basically a military dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell), one can find examples throughout history. The Roman Republic was formed when the monarchy of Rome was overthrown, but the Republic remained highly aristocratic in nature. Many of the medieval/renaissance Italian city-states were aristocratic republics as well."

KayBee236,AskWomen,1390248585.0,"I can understand why you feel embarrassed because you feel like your response was bad or wrong, but remember our brains put up defenses for the future when something in the past caused us pain. You response is one of flight (i.e., ""get the FUCK out of here he's doing the same thing run""), and it's difficult to re-train ourselves out of that reaction.

You have to work on yourself too, apart from him. I can't stress this enough. I used to pick terrible men and I have been cheated on by most of the men I've dated. My last boyfriend knew this and also was a great guy that provided me with the same promise and loyalty as my current, however I relied solely on his promise rather than building my own self-confidence. We dated for four years and, by the end of it, he was a different person and ended up cheating on me. I was devastated and mentally destroyed for a long time, and vowed to never trust again (obviously that changed). 

My point is, although I still would have been hurt by my last boyfriend's infidelity, I would not have experienced the complete breakdown I had. Being cheated on tends to mess with people's self-confidence. If you choose to be in a relationship, do not put it on the other person to fix you. It is not their responsibility and in the end it will hurt you, in some form or another. It is not easy to build confidence- it takes a long time and a lot of work. You are lucky to have a guy that is caring enough to want to help you, so you should return the favor and also help yourself by being the best damn person you can be.

TuggMahog,nfl,1390248616.0,"I will make this as objective as I can. Keeping in mind that theoretically no two teams can be compared because of the slight nuances like playcalling, environment (dome teams vs non). 


Starting with TE: there is nobody that is saying that Julius Thomas is better than Gronkowski. Granted he is injured but you can't plan for that. TDs, Yards, pure will to get into the endzone. Its all about Gronk.


Slot Receiver: Amendola vs Welker. Welker had the better statistical year, (on a team that blew away all offensive stats) and since they are both first year players with a new QB you could say this is the closest to a objective comparison we can make. Welker had almost 400 more yards but noticeably, a smaller average gain than Welker. Welker played one more game than Amendola.

#1 Wide Receiver: Thomas vs Edelman. Thomas had more than 400 yards more than Edelman and more than twice as many TDs. This regular season was his best ever. He clearly was the better #1 wide receiver this year. 


However these figures are with two hall of fame QBs throwing the ball to them. The best counter example is DT when he had arguably some of the worst QBs throwing the ball to him. During his first two years with Denver he averaged only 417 yards per SEASON, and only scored 6 TDs in two years. Clearly Manning has turned him into a premier receiver. And Tebow only threw to DT the second half of 2011. That doesn't account for his much worse season with Orton the year before.

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1390248692.0,"Sure.  But there's a difference between having a belief not clearly in the bible and simply ignoring what the bible has to say on something.  I certainly don't think all beliefs need to be directly from the bible (in fact, in Judaism that'd be heavy-duty heresy), but I do think that beliefs need to have the bible seriously discussed with it.  I don't think it matters whether or not something comes from the bible, but I do think it matters whether the person holding it can discuss the relevant bits of the bible, which I assume you can.  The issue is that it seems to me that this article is saying that because evaluating that discussion of the relevant bits of the bible is hard to gauge, it isn't worth having.

&gt;For every explication to love our enemy there is a verse about swords, and for every early Christian martyr there are a thousand Canaanites dead at the hands of God's people.

WRT the Canaanites, most serious analyses actually get a relatively anti-war thing from that.  The basic concept is that God commanded wars against the Canaanite precisely because that sort of behavior is prohibited otherwise--if God had just said ""take the land"" and the Israelites waged war the initial assumption would've been that wars of conquest are acceptable, but because it had to be spelled out on several occasions the initial assumption is that wars of conquest are prohibited."

I'm using that same tiling-in bead install kit, and looking at it, I'm pretty confident that it will be work fine if it's installed correctly. To install it correctly, the tub must be tightly placed into a square enclosure, because the wall framing and cement board backer are partly responsible for holding the seal! If there is extra 'slop' area around the tub, then the seal won't be maintained. 

Note that cement board isn't waterproof, and grout is not waterproof, and tile is not waterproof, and even if you add a waterproofer or sealant to it or over it -- it it's still not waterproof. The only solution is to put a waterproof membrane between the backer material and the tile. This can be a roll-on membrane like RedGard (or the various tile product manufacturers' versions of it), it can be a styrofoam board like Wedi-board, or it can be a membrane that gets stuck to the wall with thinset like Kerdi or ProVa.

the compound in soy that acts simililarly to estrogen is about 1/1000 as potent as actual human estrogen.  Since it binds to estrogen receptors, it can actually help balance you out if you have abnormally high estrogen levels by displacing the natural estrogen with the weaker blocking compound.

But i mean, yeah. stay away from soy pseudo-hormones.  there's probably not any actual animal hormones in the whey, milk, eggs, or meat we eat. /s"

gingerkid1234,Christianity,1390249856.0,"I don't think that all of those arguments are bad.  The flat-earth one, while obviously wrong, isn't a bad biblical argument (which is Luther's I believe)--assuming the bible is correct and without scientific knowledge, there's nothing particularly wrong about it.

I guess my point is that some biblical arguments are bad because we know they're wrong after-the-fact (flat-earth, YEC) and some are also wrong because the logic behind them is crap--even in a vacuum they don't stand up to close examination (segregation).  The issue I'm taking is that RHE seems to be saying that biblical arguments are only obviously flawed in hindsight.  While that's sometimes true (as in flat-earth and YEC), it isn't always true, nor is it always true in her examples.  While we can't know which arguments fall into the former category of wrong-because-we-know-better-now, we can certainly know which ones are bad because they were a crap argument to begin with.

To illustrate, there are all sorts of biblical arguments about homosexuality.  Even without using hindsight, some of them don't make sense just within the context of the bible.  To wit:

**Good arguments**

1. Homosexuality is prohibited because Leviticus prohibits it (and for Christians, sexual mores are still in force)
* Homosexuality is prohibited because Paul says so
* The biblical statements on homosexuality don't apply today, because homosexuality as an orientation in society didn't exist then

While you can take issue with all of these, and people do, you can make the argument without committing any obvious logical fallacies, and it's at least a reasonable starting point for a discussion.

**Bad arguments**

1. Homosexuality is forbidden because it's Sodomy, and God hated the Sodomites (except the Sodomites weren't punished for that)
* Homosexuality is permitted because the verse in Leviticus means something different than what people say (relies on misusing a dictionary)

No matter which way they are, these arguments are bad no matter what happens in the future.  They rely on either unsupported claims or on bad scholarship. I don't care what society thinks in 100 years, no one should be convinced by either one of those.

Now, assuming in 100 years we've all made a collective decision, all of the arguments one way or the other will look ""obviously wrong"".  But some of them on both sides don't require hindsight to tell they're wrong.  Just because an argument may look bad in hindsight doesn't mean it also can be identified as incorrect based on its own shoddy logic."

Tokyocheesesteak,worldnews,1390249985.0,"&gt; It's a reality of the situation by any political analyst.

We clearly disagree on this one, so let's stick to sources.

[American intelligence says they're not building the bomb.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/world/middleeast/us-agencies-see-no-move-by-iran-to-build-a-bomb.html?_r=1&amp;)

[Israeli military agrees.](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/barak-israel-very-far-off-from-decision-on-iran-attack-1.407953)

[So does the the International Atomic Energy Agency.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/30/iranian-nuclear-weapons-mohamed-elbaradei)

Whatever you can muster, it better be one helluva trustworthy source if it can definitely prove that the US, the UN and Israeli agencies are all wrong.

&gt; Yes the US has spectacular oil and nuclear industries too, but we are a high-energy demand country.

What if they are on track to become one, too? At one point, the US was also a backwards country that lagged far behind world powers.

&gt; In what part of the universe does it make sense for an Iranian leader to advocate Iranian nuclear-energy when the whole world doesn't want you to build it. You'd sacrifice your whole economy for this pursuit?

The United Nations, a rather good representative of ""the whole world"", is considering lifting the sanctions, so clearly you're wrong.

&gt; There is only one explanation: they are building nuclear weapons because they believe that being a nuclear state will allow them newer freedoms to expand their sphere of influence.

It's still your opinion. *Don't even bother repeating this opinion without a credible source. I asked you several times and you still come empty handed.*

&gt; If you were the leader of Iran you would not pursue nuclear energy this hard unless you were pursuing nuclear weapons.

If I were in that position, I'd consider switching to nuclear power so I can sell more oil overseas, thus improving my economy. Either way, I don't see how this creative writing exercise of who would've done what as a national leader pertains to a discussion of cold hard facts."

Manly-man,Hunting,1390250031.0,"**TL:DR**  -I had a standoff with some coyotes when I was deer hunting.

Early this bow season I was on some public land around a lake I fish often, not really expecting much, hunting from the ground with my recurve, I just needed some woods time.  I sat down in a a mess of branches between two fallen trees, a perfect natural blind, thinking about it, I should really go back and try it again haha but anyway; it was about a 30 minutes after sunrise when I heard what sounded like a dog fight break out around 100 yards away towards the lake.  As soon as the yipping and barking started a doe came crashing through the woods wanting nothing to do with it.  After nearly 15 minutes of the noise I figured my deer hunt was ruined so I went to go check it out.  I got to the lake and found the source.  There was a tail sticking out of a hole in the bank, the dog was standing in the water and had something cornered.  I yelled ""no"" ""phooey"" and clapped my hands, no response from the dog.  Finally I yelled hey and it heard me.  It backed out of the hole and I realized it was a coyote, big mean looking bastard.  It looked at me and showed its teeth, the hair on the back of its neck sticking up.  It was no more than 5 feet away in the water.  I took a step back and a second one backed out of the same hole and did the same.  I raised my bow and the first yote circled around to my left side, had me covered on two sides.  I drew my bow and was about to shoot the close one in the face when their attitude did a 180.  The yipped and ran off into the woods.  It was a pretty bizarre experience.

eighthgear,anime,1390250220.0,"Seriously. I never understand where all the love for that series comes from.

No matter what order I watch it in, season 1 of Haruhi Suzumiya doesn't have some absolutely brilliant plot arc or anything. Kyon meets Haruhi, finds out that Haruhi is some sort of god who can cause all sorts of shit to happen, and then spends the rest of the season trying to fix all the shit that Haruhi causes. That is about it. Now, that isn't what makes the series bad (and indeed, I don't think that it is bad, just not as great as most people seem to assume). Plenty of great shows have pretty simple plots. They excel thanks to having quality episode arcs, characters, dialogue, comedy, et cetera. But Haruhi Suzumiya doesn't really excel at any of those things. Besides Kyon, the characters are mostly one-note, with little actual development. It isn't a particularly funny show, with virtually all of the humour coming from Kyon's internal narration (credit where credit is due, the voice actor did a great job with that part). The episode stories are okay, but nothing brilliant, and the same goes for the dialogue. Simply put, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya isn't a particularly great sci-fi/supernatural show, it isn't a particularly great comedy, and it isn't a particularly great slice-of-life series. I found myself enjoying the show the most when it just went into all-out comedy mode, in episodes such as ""The Day of Sagittarius"" and ""The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00"", but those moments are few and far between. When we had things like the cast trying to solve a very obvious murder on a remote island, or win a baseball game, I was just bored. 

And then season two comes along and spends the majority of its run telling the same story.

I will say that the film, Disappearance, was *far* better than either season of the show. But that doesn't make up for the fact that the show was mostly average. Okay, perhaps a bit above-average, but nothing brilliant."

However, a point on your OP.  Words and phrases being similar doesn't mean languages ""merged"".  Languages borrow words from each other all the time.  Languages merging implies that the languages fused their grammar.  While this does occur (creoles are an example, such as Haitian Creole), it's a different phenomenon than adding loanwords, even in large numbers.  For instance, English was massively influenced by Norman French--a significant proportion of English vocabulary is from there.  And Yiddish was massively influenced by Semitic and Slavic languages--depending on dialect, huge swaths of vocabulary aren't Germanic.  Yet neither one ""merged"" with those other languages--they were influenced, but their structures remained distinct.  While I can't answer the specific question of Latin and Greek, it's a point that's important to make to understand how languages influence each other.

Additionally, Greek and Latin are related languages.  Both are [Indo-European languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages), so one would expect great similarities in vocabularies and grammars even if the languages had never had contact."

psychicsword,changemyview,1390250731.0,"&gt;IMO, this is Step 1 in reaching some kind of a compromise in the gun control debate.

I sort of agree but it depends on how it is implemented. Massachusetts has a mandatory gun safety course for applying for a FID or License to carry but they keep raising the fees for it. Just taking the course and applying for getting my LTC cost me $200 and it doesn't even guarantee that I will get one with a clean background and no criminal history. Not only that but it is taking almost 4 months to get it. To top it off I didn't learn a single thing that you couldn't learn from watching a 15 minute slide show before applying for the LTC.

&gt;Anyone under the age of 18 needs to go through firearm safety before they can legally handle a gun.

This is kind of crazy. I have shot a bunch as a kid but always with supervision. In Boy Scouts I shot .22 riffles and they taught us the basics of gun safety with 3 adults right there to watch us. As I got older I trap shot with my dad before taking the training I mentioned above. Really there isn't any risk as long as someone who has taken the course is watching and if they have the gun legally then they would have taken the course when the applied for the permit. The biggest thing is that if no one is watching the kid and they handle a gun all you are doing is making them a criminal for doing something they probably don't understand is wrong. 

The easiest solution would be to make it so the liability of how the gun is used is placed on the person who owns the gun and is lending it out and that they have to watch the person they are letting use the gun. Your suggestion would make it impossible for people to try out shooting before they go through the costly training and permit process. 

&gt;Its about 15-20 hours, given by cops, and it really shows how dangerous guns are, and how much respect must be given.

Holy shit. If you make it a requirement that people give up almost a week of work how will poor people ever be able to participate in that right? The basic gun safety course including live fire training that I took only took 4 hours and it was really comprehensive. Gun safety is pretty easy. It can be narrowed down to 4 basic rules, Treat all guns as if they were loaded until you can prove otherwise(and it is apparent to other people), ""Never put your finger on the trigger unless you are going to shoot, never point the gun at something you don't want destroyed or dead, and always make sure your target and the area behind your target are clear of safety hazards."" The rest of the class is just rehashing that same 4 concepts in different ways and showing how to load and unload a gun. Not being stupid with a gun is easy and doesnt take 15-20 hours of a cop's extremely limited time and wasting your own time. "

&gt;We like to characterize the people in the quotes above as having used Scripture to their own advantage. But I find it both frightening and humbling to note that, often, the way we make the distinction between those who loved Scripture and those who used Scripture is hindsight. 

While she also says what you're saying, it's that bit I take issue with.  Some people who sincerely loved scripture and tried to form their opinions based on religion honestly were wrong in hindsight.  Just because they were wrong doesn't make their opinions retroactively less valid.  They made good points, but couldn't possibly have known that other data showed they were wrong.

But people who ""use scripture"" aren't wrong because of hindsight.  They may even be proven right!  But people who make bad scriptural arguments are wrong without looking towards information they didn't know.

Mostly, I think this sets up a dicotomy of ""loving scripture = correct in hindsight"" and ""using scripture = wrong in hindsight"", when all possible combinations of those are possible.  There certainly are opinions on what the bible says that don't require hindsight at all--the distinction can be clear from the beginning."

Neebat,ProgrammerHumor,1390251295.0,"This is another case of changes in the use cases.  Very few people actually use the sleep function as it was originally designed.

The sleep mode specifically has to support ""woodlands where a bear attack is likely"".  That's in the damn requirements still!  Who uses that, seriously?  If we could drop that requirement, we could end support for weak auditory signals to end sleep mode.

We tried some alpha testing where we disabled auditory cues entirely during sleep mode.  Users loved it, but after some units were destroyed by fire, we had to abort that testing.

Honestly, the whole sleep system still has a lot of bugs.  While in sleep mode, I'd like to see the urinary system completely disabled along with ejaculation, and some kind of configuration menu for the visualizations during sleep mode.

Users have been requesting more sleep-mode visualizations involving Jennifer Lawrence, and who can blame them?

Normally you can feel your cervix with your one leg up on something like on the lid of toilet or side of the tub. IUD strings are funny, your doctor will have cut them at an appropriate length but at this time you should feel them sticking out of the opening of your cervix. They may feel a little stiff but they do soften over time and will eventually curl around your cervix (makes it a little harder to check like this but still possible). 

You're not checking for length your just checking that they're still in the same spot as before and still there. The length won't change but like I said it will naturally start to curl around the cervix. Be sure not the pull on the strings. 

Everyone's experiences with IUDs are completely unique to that person. It's normal to feel paranoid about it for awhile, I for sure did! It's a small device living in my uterus! What that's not normal! 

I worked in a OBGYN clinic as part of my clinical rotations for Nursing School and I noticed the people who had issues with their IUDs had issues from the get go. The key things your looking for is fever (evidence of infection) and persistent abdominal pain. From the patients that I've talked to about proliferation or IUD rejection, they had extreme abdominal pains and cramps that were evident early on in the insertion. Not to say there are not special cases but you can't live your life expecting to always be that special case.

From what you've mentioned, it sounds like it's working just fine but be mindful of alarming symptoms. "

I wasn't sure whether to take B1 or B2, but I'm sort of glad I just decided to go for B1 and get a good grade rather than just scrape by on the B2, which I'm aiming to take in the future but is kind of on hold right now. I think that in a way, the test is harder than some people seem to think, and in others it's not so bad. I felt like I made a bit of a mess of my speaking (I don't remember, but that may have been my weakest grade in the breakdown, though still well above the pass), I couldn't remember some conjugations and a few words I needed. But I think the key there was that I just kept on speaking, tried to word things differently and communicated with the examiner rather than let it stop me. 

I've been to France with this level of French and it was enough to get by (we had to, no one else in my family could speak it), but the higher your level by the time you get there, the better. It'd probably take me a while to feel comfortable working in France, though I probably could. It really depends what line of work you're going into, as well. I have French-speaking friends that I can talk to, and I've been to France at least a dozen times, but it's very different learning in a classroom or learning in your own than it is to have to use it in a number of situations you haven't ""practiced"", so to speak. It kind of takes being put into the country to realize just how much vocabulary and fluency you lack, so no matter how confident you feel in your level at the moment, it's likely to take a bit of a hit once you get there, but your level should really improve once you're immersed and really making an effort to learn more.

So maybe the Dolphins weren't allowed to explicitly mention the mental health issue but were allowed to disclose the police report? The article also makes it seem like they expected the Browns to find it themselves:

Other significant reasons included too much arguing (56%), infidelity (55%), marrying too young (46%), unrealistic expectations (45%), lack of equality in the relationship (44%), lack of preparation for marriage (41%), and abuse (29%). (People often give more than one reason, so the percentages add up to more than 100%.)""

The main causes in 2004 were:

Adultery; Extramarital sex; Infidelity - 27%

Domestic violence - 17%

Midlife crisis - 13%

Addictions, e.g. alcoholism and gambling - 6%

Workaholism - 6%

The Colts loss I will still say they went vanilla for because they knew that it was most likely that they would face the Colts in the playoffs.  They still in general looked good against good teams and just couldn't pull off the win.

pretentious_lowbrow,CollegeBasketball,1390252585.0,"It really was the exact definition of a quality loss though. We were not only able to keep up, we had the lead very late in the game. That low scoring, defense heavy game is exactly what I expected out of Pitt vs Cuse. Both teams are showing the ACC what it means to play rough and tumble, hard-fought basketball games. And when Cuse comes to the Pete, I don't think it'll go their way again."

WC_EEND,LongDistance,1390252636.0,"&gt; Once a cheater always a cheater. It's not a one time thing. If you're willing to do it now, you'll do it later down the line. Sorry, but it's the psychology of a cheater.

This is bullshit, sorry. There is a whole world of difference between someone who made a mistake once and someone who systematically cheats on their SO (for the latter person, this is true, yes, but for the former not so much). 

The simple fact of the matter is that OP is human and humans make mistakes. Add alcohol to the mix and well, sometimes things can end badly. 

I'm not trying to condone what OP did here, I'm just trying to point out that things usually are not as black and white as people like to pretend they are."

He's not sexually experienced. So he's still wired to his exs sexual expectations. But I, a virgin, am kinda excited to learn with and grow with him sexually. 

But you're totally okay to just not focus on it for now. If it happens, it happens. Carpe diem!"
