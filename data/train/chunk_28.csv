Banner_Free,fatlogic,1390012770.0,"(Okay, I wrote this entire thing and then realized /u/rollerpigeons already made all the relevant points. I'll post it anyway because I'm vain and love the sight of my own words plastered all over the Internet.)

For background: I lost weight on a ketogenic diet (5'6"" male, age 27, 185lbs-&gt;155lbs) and have kept it off for years.

&gt; keto asserts that eating too many calories isn't the problem

This isn't true at all. There are some folks on /r/keto who believe this, but it's absolutely not true, and anyone who's trying to lose the ""last ten pounds"" on a ketogenic diet can testify to that.

Keto is so effective, despite paying so little regard to calorie counting, because it makes you full while still maintaining a calorie deficit. So as long as you're only eating in response to hunger (rather than binging out of boredom, stress, depression, etc) you'll fill up before you break even on calories.

Now, as you're losing weight, your BMR will drop and your appetite will drop with it, but at some point - generally when you reach a healthyish weight - they'll come into alignment. At that point (which is where I am), you'll likely need to actively count calories to make sure you're maintaining the deficit which is necessary for weight loss.

The reason there's such a widespread belief that ""calories don't matter"" is that most of the folks on /r/keto (at least, the vocal ones) tend to be seriously overweight. You'll see people who are trying to lose 50, 100, 200 lbs of weight. At that point, your appetite and BMR are so far diverged that you'd feel disgustingly stuffed well before you got to a caloric surplus.

Most of them start counting when they start approaching healthy weights and their rate of loss starts to slow along with it. Remember that the more fat you have to lose, the more fat your body is capable of losing each day."

NahDudeFkThat,TheBluePill,1390013078.0,"&gt;Appeal to nature is a fallacy. If we should do things purely because they're ""natural"", we'd be naked and living in caves.

The fact that we EVOLVED and don't do this anymore is in fact NATURE NATURALLY taking its course. Literally everything that happens is nature taking its course. Even what humans deem ""unnatural"" is Nature itself, being itself. Randomness in every way shape or form is natural as well.

Nature is the goddamn universe doing what it does. Fuck that, Nature and Bio-mechanics is God pretty much, if you believe in such thing. Ain't no such thing as the ''unnatural.'' Everything is natural.


&gt;What science? What studies support this? I notice TRPers always get really quiet when I ask that question... By the way, here's some science that contradicts your beliefs: summary, full report. Though the study was done by a feeeeeeeeeeeemale, so I don't know that you'll accept it as proof.

Really? The countless links that speak irrefutable truth on the sidebar of TRP is not enough proof for you?

And that shit you linked explained WHY we are sexually and psychologically different. And biodiversity. It said nothing to disprove the fact that most (**masculine**) Men of cultures around the entire globe are dominant, both socially and sexually (*NOT always* in the bully type), and how most **feminine** women (who are generally submissive) are attracted to this powerful trait. Shit, not only feminine women love Men who are dominant socially, but other socially competent Men as well.

Essentially, a masculine Man will be loved everywhere because he is naturally charming."

matip is by far the most talented defender we have. and its not even a close competition. people tend to forget how young matip is. the kid is just 22 and is in his 5th season as a starter for us, played in the worldcup already at a tender age of 18 and nets 122 bundesliga, 23 championsleague and 13 euro league appearances already. let that just sink in for a minute.
and now please compare matip to peers on his position. the only defender that just comes close to that number in itself is phil jones. while varane and nastasic are both younger then him, they wont get to his numbers either. and thats just talking statistics here.
then you need to factor in how good he is for his age already. you dont usually get the combination of attributes in a defender that matip brings to the table usually in a defender that young. he is excellent anticipation already, has good defensive and offensive heading and is fast as lightening. and despite it being a running joke among schalke fans already, he has a really decent ability to open up the game from defence with passes. matip reminds me actually a bit of the young boateng, but with way better passing. remember how often he got ridiculed and has been seen as rather untalented defender, even in his first season at bayern? defenders with the style matip plays need experience and will only get better with age. his play doesnt rely on physique. given enough time to properly develop and having a coach that is willing to work on his weaknesses (as being a tad to overconfident in his offensive and passing abilitys at times) you got a worldclass defender right there.

yes, he does make mistakes. sometimes even silly mistakes. but so does every defender, especially those that are playing for us. but it is undeniable that out of all our defenders matip has by far the most potential. and we will bite ourselves in the ass in a couple of years that we let him join the cameroon national team, instead of ours."

Don't get me wrong, I think BBC's 'Sherlock' is absolutely brilliant, and it is currently my favorite show on TV, but I also think that comparing the two shows its a bit apples and oranges. Yes, they both show a modern-day version of Sherlock Homes, but that's where the similarities end. I could go on and on about everything that's different, but suffice to say ""Elementary"" is written as a drawn-out, American show, 20-something-episodes-a-season. As such, the plots all have to wrap up in 45 minutes, and it's much more less likely that they will use any plots from the books. In 'Sherlock', every episode is like a mini-movie, they can expand and take artistic license with plots from the actual Conan Doyle novels and stories. That being said, Moriarty in Elementary is freaking hot.

I removed another friend for his extreme political and religious views. He had done a complete 180 in his beliefs.

I tolerated it as long as I could, but he was so full of shit, just trying to fit in with the newest movement. Then he tried to convert me and I was just done.

NahDudeFkThat,TheBluePill,1390015007.0,"&gt;So you argued that we should take the red pill like the Matrix on the basis that it's natural... but then contradicted your own argument by claiming that anything a human does is inherently natural, which would of course include things like feminism. I think you might be an idiot. Congratulations.

You know what else is natural, princess? Serious consequences, turmoil and backlash when silly things such as feminism (aka **War On Boys**) arise. Fact. 

Here's another fun fact: Feminism is the cause of low libido among women. Yall CLAIM to want to be treated equally, but when treated equally, your vagina dries up. Fucking beautiful! I was the very first one to claim bullshit on that til I actually started talking to feminist chicks (the very very few hot ones, anyway) and proved that study done. I treat it as a ""shit-test"" and plow through normally. She is 1000% happier, and I am too. 

Goddamn, I'm droppin' gems out here b

We can sit here and go back and forth and argue ""BUT _____ IS ALSO NATURAL, THEREFORE DERP"" but here's the fact of the matter: patriarchy isn't going anywhere as long as we're hardwired biologically the way we all are (a long long long long long time). Nature is the dictator of it all, and it has made Men masculine and women feminine. Let that sink in real quick. Slavery and and all these natural inequalities aren't going anywhere either unfortunately. It takes thousands, and thousands, and thousands of years for a **tiny single little thing** to change. Nature has made the world mostly a patriarchal world, and this will continue to be like this probably forever (k maybe not).

Just know that there's a reason we aint in matriarchal system is because nature loves Men

msbubbles326,weddingplanning,1390015365.0,"So I'm sharing this not as a sob story, but for perspective. 

My wedding was only a state away, but I planned everything via e-mail which was easy enough, even as we moved super close to the date and lots of little things had to be done.

Two days before our wedding, my father-in-law died suddenly. He died in the morning, and I still had to get my mani-pedi that night with my maid of honor. Weirdest manicure ever- best glass of wine ever while waiting for my toes to dry. We had the wedding and it was amazing. The best day, even though underneath it all we were so heart broken. I'm not religious, or spiritual, but I swear him and my mom teamed up somehow to make that day happy despite his recent loss and her loss a few years ago. 

We had to cancel our honeymoon, which would have been to Universal in Florida. It was pretty much our dream honeymoon, but he just wasn't up for it. We actually had to leave our hotel early the morning after the wedding to get back for his dad's wake/funeral.

We did have the week off still, and decided to take a mini-honeymoon in the Berkshires as we're not far from them. We found a lovely little B&amp;B and spent a couple nights over a long weekend. It wasn't what we had planned, but we got to spend the weekend being newlyweds and enjoying it.

So the point to all of this- life happens in an instant, but if you roll with it, it can still be okay! He might be starting a new job, but maybe he can talk to his new boss and explain that he's getting married and is canceling his honeymoon, but would still like that Friday off for a long weekend. You can go somewhere in your new state that's inexpensive, but gives you a chance to explore and have some fun. You can make it work. It might be not be ideal, but I promise you, all that will matter is that he will be your husband and you'll be happy together, no matter where you are or what you're doing. 

You're wedding will be amazing, and you're new life with your husband will be amazing too! Best of luck to both of you :)"

&gt;I can definitely sense a difference in how more experienced (male) scientists interact with made-up me vs bare face (uneven skin, slight acne, tired looking eyes) me.

I'm curious about your experience with this -- are they the same people who know who you are, yet treat you differently on the days you wear / don't wear makeup? Because that just boggles the mind...

As for people who maybe have a negative first impression of you due to the makeup (and hence treat you differently), it could be any of those reasons you mentioned. It's old and unfortunate, but makeup does bring up those assumptions for a lot of people that it's materialistic/vain or being attractive=less intelligent.

What can be done about it? Not much, aside from 'proving your worth' so to speak. Demonstrate a high standard of work/behaviour, have your colleagues know you better and can vouch for you, show you're a multi-faceted individual who can enjoy makeup and still be intelligent, capable, do other things/hobbies. Nobody should have to do that, but I find it's an unfortunate reality.

Since the vision changes it's been clear to anyone that mains Teemo on a medium level and above that he was toxic to the newly created gameplay environment. His mushrooms *will* be gutted eventually because there's simply no room for them with how the vision mechanics work now.

Because I've played Teemo for nearly four years I love *him* not his power. When the on-hit build was all the rage I went away from that and started playing him AP, because I knew it would get nerfed (it was completely ridiculous). Problem is: There's no builds left for him until they drastically change the shrooms. As long as the shrooms exist in their current form, and with the current vision mechanics, no other aspect of him can be made any stronger, deeper or more complex. 

Teemo *is* his shrooms right now and until they change the core mechanic of that ultimate that is all he will be allowed to be, because otherwise he'd break the game. So I'm just gonna keep playing Teemo and wait for the cycle to play out. First they'll nerf the shrooms. Then he'll be unplayed for a very long time because he has no other significant tools. Then they'll rework the shrooms. Then he'll just be underpowered because his current skillset is terrible, in order to offset the insane power of the shrooms. And **then** they'll either rework him completely or buff up his other skills.

In the meanwhile I'll just keep playing and loving him :)"

It was actually revealed in a later lawsuit that Microsoft caved to Intel to lower the requirements for ""Vista Capable"" branding to allow for their 915 chipset to qualify, resulting in a bunch of computers that couldn't run Aero properly. This then pissed off HP whom they had promised that high-end graphics were required, causing them to no longer give a shit. 

http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/03/the-vista-capable-debacle-intel-pushes-microsoft-bends/

&gt; This in turn did two things: 1. Decreased focus of OEMs planning and shipping higher-end graphics for Vista Ready programs 2. Reduced the focus by IHV's to ready great WHQL-qualified graphics drivers. We can see this today with Intel's inability to ship a compelling, full-featured 945 graphics driver for Windows Vista.""

If you still feel unsure, take it to another shop and get another opinion. Electrical/computer problems are hard to pin down because of their nature.

Second, it makes fighting potentially financially prohibitive for some, if they want to be on equal footing with their opponents. I feel like it'd make the armor you can afford a bigger part of your success, versus your level of skill.

&gt;At the same time, one of my favourite reviews came from a random woman who said that she loved one of my main characters because they weren't a typical ""hero"" - they were a regular person, warts and all, who was reacting to the situation as that regular person might.

Slightly off topic, but have you ever noticed how characters in TV and film NEVER react to things like seeing horrifically dismembered corpses, et cetera, with anywhere *near* the proper amount of terror? I feel like they all lean on the piss poor crutch of, ""Well no emotion showed on his face because he was so deep in shock!!!!"" I'm not sure if it's bad acting or bad writing.

According to you being pulled over and harassed by cops just because you want to go for a ride with friends is perfectly acceptable because they aren't being charged or arrested? Forget the fact that if some cop with a god complex decides that they have found ""evidence"" (and by that I mean lie and say they found drugs or something that doesn't exist) that the ""evidence"" will be kept secret so there is absolutely no way to challenge any charges brought against you because as far as you know you didn't have anything illegal, but in court they will say ""well he have the evidence, we just cannot tell you what it is, or if it even exists, you just have to take our word for it""

And don't reply saying ""Well just don't go riding with friends, so you don't get harassed"" because that's even more of a bullshit response, people should be free to do what they like, some people like motorcycles, criminalizing a hobby like this is just a few steps away from a police state.

Bikie gangs or not, this Attorney-General has compiled a list of Motorcycle clubs, and without any evidence or reason, has stated that they are all not allowed to exist. No one is allowed to say otherwise because they don't even know what they've done wrong. 

To put it into perspective for your adolescent mind: current anti-bikie laws are like if someone on reddit was dealing drugs and posted a picture onto reddit of their stash. Police see this picture and say ""well it was posted on reddit, so reddit must be a gathering ground for criminals, therefore anyone we find with a reddit account is now going to be harassed until they can prove they are innocent"""

If you have the crystal crew member and don't have the crystal ship, you obviously don't know what you're doing because it's your first time playing through that quest.  How the heck is someone supposed to know what they're doing on the first run with a crystal crew?

&gt;I fail to see how getting the Crystal Cruiser is a task so arduous it takes over 100 hours

So you've never heard of the RNG?  It's luck-based, not skill-based.  This entire game is luck based.  You can get a missile to the teleporter and have your crew die before you can bring them home, or I've even had crew die from a missile to the medbay (and yes, I do prioritize evasion).

&gt; Having done this, you only really need to do a couple dozen runs at most before you get the events in the right order.

Uh, no, maybe if you're lucky.  I fell into the ""over 100 hours"" camp for crystal and I definitely had my strategy down.  I'd beaten the game on normal with every ship, had a very high win rate (don't keep track of percentages but would guess something like 80-90%) and the crystal ship just didn't happen for me until I'd spent a good chunk of time in the game.  Then somehow I got the right events in the right order at least 3 or 4 more times that month after unlocking the crystal ship."

Realize this: you won't always feel ""in love"", and sometimes you will feel flat out out of love and not attracted to the other, so....
Make sure your commitment is stronger than your feelings. On those days that you hate him/her, it reminds you that no matter what, you're committed to love them and not hurt them. 
Also, remember that  loving someone and being in love with someone are two completely different things. You can be angry at each other, and still love one another."

here, when you see a child sitting in a chair seat for, as this photo alleges, many hours per day, and, as this photo shows, at risk of being crushed by a sack of flour, you report it. because then someone looks into it. also, as i stated in my original post, it is state law where i live; to not report this would be illegal.

Having seen how a lot of people on this sub can't even see the word ""patriarchy"" without responding ""but patriarchy isn't real!"" makes me feel like I don't blame them (feminists) for saying that...

I mean, you can think that patriarchy isn't real. Fine. That's your opinion. But if, every time, you dismiss an entire argument with that phrase... you're not even trying to understand the argument in the first place.

To have an open mind, you have to be willing to hear out an argument and agree or disagree based solely on the merits of that argument, not based on opinions you've already formed. Taking prior knowledge into account makes sense, but taking prior opinion into account means you'll never get anywhere.

Edit: I had one of those revelations-while-showering that made me realize this post probably comes off too much as seeming like I'm trying to say ""MRA's are all closed-minded idiots,"" and I wanted to assure you all that no, that's definitely not what I'm trying to say.

The only thing you can really do is let time distance yourself from it.  Start working out.  Pick up a new hobby.  Anything to keep your mind occupied.

I dont particularly recommend this, but one thing i did was got a tattoo... After something like that happens you walk around completely numb for a while, you feel like youve stopped feeling.  Tattoos hurt like hell, you cant be numb to them.  For me it was kinda of turning a point in getting over my first love.  

You will meet someone else.  Even if you think youll never connect with anyone like that again.  I remember about 5 months after my first love started dating the new guy (that she ended up marrying), one month after i got my first tattoo, i met a girl at my 21st bday party that made everything feel better again (if not perfectly back together).   We talked for hours at the party, got drunk, danced a little, ended up making out on the beach and talking for several more hours until dawn.  

Nothing came out of it except we would talk every few months.  But it helped.  

Hell, I met my wife only a month after i cut off all contact with the second hardest breakup of my life.  Only time will help, but until then, keep your mind occupied, do something productive.

FewRevelations,FeMRADebates,1390020768.0,"My ideal feminist game kind of already exists. It's the Mass Effect trilogy, playing as female Shepard.

I wish female Shepard was cannon. She's just a better-rounded character. Male Shepard is just a boring rehash of every other male action hero. Female Shepard is a badass woman with agency, who doesn't let her gender get in the way. People hardly even bring up her gender, and when they do... it's in a way that only highlights women's issues, but without being all in-your-face (take the moment in the first game when you have to question that guy in the bar. If you're a girl, he makes some really creepy sexual comments. Shepard handles it well: by calling him a creep and telling him to sober up).

She's not motherly. Her main concern isn't romance (although that is still a healthy part of her life) or having kids. She doesn't have a rape sub-plot or get pregnant (seriously, sometimes I think writers just don't know what other kinds of plots to give women). She's just... herself.

In summation, we don't need anything special to have ""feminist"" games. We just need the same games we already have to bear females as the main characters -- and not just as options. Because as Mass Effect and Fable and many other gender-open franchises have shown, when you give an option, the male is still usually considered the canon. Having gender options helps, but what we really need are more games with a female leading lady -- period.

I think it's only fair, after all. Guys have been the main characters of just so many games already. When is it the gals' turn?"

risto1116,GNV,1390020974.0,"&gt;I really like to dance (waltz/swing/tango, cant really hip hop)

If I recall correctly, The Atlantic (in Downtown) does Motown Mondays. Might be your scene.

&gt;would like to find a place with cheap drinks where I can either do that or easily engage in meeting other people.

Depends on your style. If you don't want the hip hop scene and would rather the indie or hipster vibe (which is also my scene), I recommend The Top. No dancing really, but a great place to meet people. Cheap drinks? The Midnight. I usually pregame there and meet fun people I can spend my evening with. 

&gt;Places that offer pool, trivia, ping pong, and live bands are also a plus.

It definitely sounds like Downtown is your scene. For games, go to Tall Paul's and Main Street Billiards or Palomino. Boca Fiesta is a great place too because you can get some awesome food, hear live music in the breezeway, then jump in to Palomino for some pool. 

&gt;Do most people tend to barhop?

Absolutely. I like to hit up 4-5 places in a night, unless the scene is good and I get hooked. The Atlantic on Thursday night will sometimes hook me in to spending the whole night there (but there's cover).

&gt;I feel like lines are too long for that to be effective. What's a good time to try and get to a place?

Get there early and get your wristband so you don't have to wait in line, plus you can hop in and out much easier. I suggest 9:30, but whatever works for you is fine. But if the line is long at one place, there's usually a good spot right across the street you can check out. **Explore on your own!** You don't need to take our suggestions. Everyone likes something different.

&gt;Also, what are my best travel options? If I don't have a DD, am I limited to the dates and places the Later Gator runs?

Eh, kinda. Back in my single days, I used to drink and drink and drink and call a cab. It got expensive. Then I started meeting people and asking for rides or staying at their place. I felt pretty bad about that, too, so eventually I just never went Downtown without a DD. I've never used Later Gator."

Whether women want to admit it or not we are socialized to be the comforters to be the one who is emotionally supportive. Look at /r/askwomen it's an echo chamber of feel good bs with no real truth behind it. 

I have a friend who is overweight, has some interesting body odor and some severely lacking social skills. Now when I broke it down to him and explained he needs to present himself in a better manner, I was telling him what he didn't want to hear. What he wanted to hear was that girl that he has been pinning after for years, who has fucked several of his friends, was the one to blame or maybe it was his friends but putting the responsibility on him was rude. He believed his personality should be good enough. In his words couldn't see she he would never hurt her? No because if a girl likes you she's not walking around hoping you won't hurt her. 

There is this pervasiveness in society in general where everyone is special everyone deserves a golden star, and to tell someone that they need to earn that golden star is out of hand. But for some reason women are latching on to this crap more than men. Hard truths are not easily given and even more difficult to receive.

Tsuritama -- wacky show about aliens, fishing, and the end of the world.

Birdy the Mighty: Decode -- alien police officer accidentally kills an ""ordinary high school student"" while conducting an investigation on Earth, and they have to share a body while his is sent for repairs. Action, Comedy, Romantic subplots, Savin' the world.

Aim for the Top!! Gunbuster -- The only anime I can think of that deals with the effects of [time dilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) caused by traveling faster than light. Saving the world, aliens."

The first is the kind that requires exceptional talent and skill. The human ability to physically create such art is impressive and inspiring.

The second kind of art requires the imagination to conceive of and execute something esthetically compelling that hasn't been done before.

Most people have the skill to create that art, but what is so impressive and inspiring is the imagination involved; to dream up something both unique and effective that hadn't been done before.

Someone from middle school could do this. But no one did. She imagined it. She did it. Without her this medium would not exist.

The art is really cool. I don't understand why people get so bent out of shape because they are ""physically"" capable of it when they aren't ""conceptually"" capable of it.

The additional damage is just a bonus. And I predict that the sorc ult to improve weapon attacks won't be as popular as the one that dispels all magic in an area, seeing as how that will save lives, and a living player will do more damage than a dead one.

We don't really know how the fighting will be at endgame, but ZOS has said many times that dungeon enemies should have massively better AI than in other mmos. This won't be like WoW where the tank holds the boss and everyone else just has to worry about doing the most damage or healing that they possibly can. Healers cannot target tanks directly so tanks and heals have to work to stay together. Mobility and CC will be important. The damage boosts might sound nice on some of those ultimates, but maybe the damage boosts are so high just so that they can remain slightly viable when you are giving up such great utility."

AssociationFootball,Guitar,1390022803.0,"This reminds me of a story i have from my college days:

I walked into a typical college party, mostly friends of friends, less than 50 people.  

We were drinking, having a good time, when i notice the shittiest looking guitar and amp tucked away beside the couch.  I dont even remember the manufacturer of the guitar, im guessing it was one of those guitars you bought out of an early 90s Service Merchandise or Sears catalog.  Both the guitar and amp were in terrible condition.  The guitar was literally missing a pickup, as well as most of the paint.  The amp looked like it had been sitting in the back of an old garage for the last 20 years. 

I was a lil tipsy so i decided to pull out this amp and guitar and noodle around, simple pentatonic licks.  The owner of the guitar looked at me, looked at his guitar and said ""shit, i guess its not the guitar that sounds bad, its me"".  

I laughed, then started noodling around some more, when another guy with an acoustic appeared out of nowhere and started strumming the chords to Randy Rogers' ""Lost and Found"" (if youre not southern you probably wont know the song).  I started playing along and singing with him when, unbeknownst to us, the entire party had stopped, the music was shut off, and everyone was watching us.  

Ive played gigs before, but that was still one of my favorite musical moments, and it happened while i was playing one of the shittiest guitars ive ever played in my life.  

Tl;dr.  You dont need expensive equipment to sound good and turn heads.  "

flclreddit,mtgcube,1390023052.0,"I'll kindly disagree. Top Tier levelers are Student of Warfare and Enclave Cryptologist, I think others will agree. Many times slower blue decks don't have a T1 drop, so they lose that mana anyways. Cryptologist hits T1, then quickly levels into a looter. With very little mana investment she quickly becomes straight card advantage. She's great as a reanimator enabler and card fixing machine, and it doesn't take two turns necessarily to utilize her; she can be a fine looter for 1UU. The versatility makes the cost negligible.

My Mono Red archetype isn't always viable. Plenty of times R will dip into W for some more hitters. I don't run Ball Lightning or Blistering Firecat, as they are too cost specific to be efficient in my cube. I really wanted Kargan Dragonlord to be good, but he was far too often a trap. If I'm spending RR, I want it to be an Ash Zealot, Lightning Mauler, or Hellspark Elemental, to push out some hurt quickly. If I'm playing midrange, I'm probably in R/G, and being two colors really hurts Dragonlord's reliability to level when you need him to. 

I suppose I'm more at odds with the level up mechanic to begin with. I used to really like it, I even had a level up deck; but it often just disappointed me. It's very dissatisfying to build up a creature, then see them shot down. They are removal-magnetic; your opponent knows you will likely put more mana into them, so they'll gladly hold back a removal spell to time walk you with.

I guess I just don't think Kargan Dragonlord is necessary for midrange. He's too slow, cost specific, and susceptible to removal."

solo_sysygy,Christianity,1390023069.0,"I've really enjoyed the recent movement towards modern hymnody--both setting old hymns to new music, and writing new songs with the same lyrical and emotional complexity as what was found in some of the great hymns.  One of the best groups that is doing this is [Indelible Grace](http://www.igracemusic.com/), which is led by Kevin Twit, who leads the Reformed University Fellowship at Belmont University.

Twit is an excellent songwriter and musician (he graduated from Berklee College of Music), but he's also a great teacher. So his emphasis is not just to make catchy music, but to create art that captures the full complexity of the Christian walk and points us to the gospel without marginalizing how much of a struggle it is sometimes.  Anyway, if this interests you at all I highly recommend that you check out their documentary, [Roots and Wings](http://youtu.be/dfAD8oofyM0) (Youtube link; I recommend you skip ahead to 15:35 or so)."
vinogradov,askcarsales,1390023094.0,"Make sure you have a job for 6 months, and the requirements hopefully08 said. As far as the rusty engine goes, I personally wouldn't buy it. On many lots a clean engine is a good tell of how well a car has been kept. There is also no reason why an engine bay should be in that condition (my 04 mazda 3 doesn't have rust, and shouldn't) - maybe a flood or replaced engine. As for deals, a lot of the prices are dependent on location, we used NADA and Westlakes dealercenter interface to get a feel for prices, we like it more then KBB. Mazda 3 is a great car past 2007 (don't have to worry about a transmission falling out on the road like me) but keep an eye on motor mounts. With experience, I would say buy newer. Age seems to do a whole lot to the condition of the car but not so much to the price. Everything starts to break at once or one by one very fast, have an emergency fund ready.

The_White_Baron,learnmath,1390023154.0,"First, it's hardly fair to blame ""a string of bad math teachers"" when you admit in your very first line that you refused to pay attention and found the material unimportant. Don't blame your instructors. And this is coming from someone who ignored trig in high school, and paid the price by having to relearn it along the way. 

First you need to assess how much you know. If you can't perform basic algebraic steps in problems, or number crunch, you definitely won't be able to do calculus beyond a superficial level. You definitely need algebra to tackle trig, which is itself a different kind of beast. I would practice geometry after algebra, and then trig, and then tackle pre-calc.

The way to do this is tons of practice problems. A textbook doesn't work for everyone. What you do is find a book with problems and solutions. Websites also exist, such as purplemath. There's no way around practice. 

find general formula/rule → see examples → solve problems

Rinse and repeat until you're sick of it and/or attain mastery. At some point, you gotta suck it up and swallow your pride. Either you're going to find material you feel demeans you, or you'll going to tackle material you can't handle and it won't be useful. 

Not to rub it in, but if you didn't want to cripple your options, you should have paid more attention and worked harder. This is the most telling part of all

&gt; I fell behind and eventually *gave up.*

This makes me question your seriousness. Either way, I recommend you go for purplemath, see how far you get, and be prepared for frustrations. Math is an exercise in frustration. Learning will take time. [Here's a link to assess whether you're actually serious about self-learning.](http://www.purplemath.com/stdysrvy.htm)"

It's really not safe to guess that. The kids could have ""confesed"" it to other priests not wanting to tell their parents or get in trouble. Or their parents could have told the church authorities not wanting to get to embarrass the church or for their families to become the centre of attention.

bananaruth,AskReddit,1390023288.0,"Depends on where you live. And yes. Even if it's just the sprinkler system, because in a big building/urban area, a fire could spread fast. Often the sprinkler system being damaged effects the fire/emergency alarms and they have to shut them off until they are fixed. It also depends on what the Fire Marshall says about whether you have to go in the building or merely observe the outside (different buildings have different structures - outdoor vs indoor staircases for example).

The negative of the job is that it isn't uncommon for someone to call the police on you because they don't know what you are doing loitering at night. The police are informed that there is a fire watch in place though, so it isn't a big deal when you explain.

Working in property management has a lot of minuses. I wouldn't recommend doing it for the off chance that there'll be a fire watch AND you're the one who gets the job. Most of the time you're dealing with complaints : ""MY neighbor put in olive shades! Clearly in the bylaws it says that window coverings must be white or wood tone. It is a blight on the community! Fix this immediately before property values dwindle."" Then you send a letter and the person with the olive shades calls: ""I don't understand what's the problem! I've had olive shades for years. They're part of my decor and I refuse to change them!"" Or you're managing financials, or any other manner of mostly dull work. Laminating pool passes is kinds fun. 

tl;dr I'm never living in an HOA. No one I know who works in property management does.

I call their customer service line and besides waiting for an hour or so, they gave me shit about it.  Eventually I managed to argue with them enough that I wasn't trying to rip them off and had to send them a photo of the contents of the box. I left the unit on the plastics sprues and returned it to the store then sold everything  I had from GW which was 2 armies at the time.

Now for comparison I had a customer service issue with Privateer press who makes WARMACHINE. I had bought one of their devout warjacks which had just come out. Got it home and opened it up to find it is missing a leg. I sent an email to their customer service department. I sent them the ""packed by X"" number and they sent the part out. I open it up and it's the wrong part. I sent them another email and they apologized profusely for the mistake. I get the package in the mail and its bigger than the other one. They sent me the replacement part *and* another warjack that was also new at the time.

temp9876,AskWomen,1390023458.0,"Here's an interesting answer:  No I wouldn't, but yes I did.

When I met my husband I flat out refused to consider dating him because he had a toddler and I wasn't up to that.  I wasn't willing to miss out on the portion of his life that he shared with his child, and I wasn't willing to become a part of a child's life so casually.  I was a stepchild myself and my stepdad was brilliant, he is my dad in every way that matters, I know what it means to be a good stepparent and I just how hard it is.  I wasn't willing to be a bad one.

It took about 6 months and I was best friends with my husband, he was perfect in every respect... except on paper.  But part of what made him so wonderful was the way he adored his son and how strong he was taking care of him.  Finally I gave up my ""criteria"" and went for him.  Before I met his son and within only a couple of weeks of dating I made it clear that I expected we were serious, monogamous, and headed for marriage because those were the only terms I would accept for dating a single dad.

I still remember the day I met my stepson, for me it is a little anniversary every year that only I know is special.  I stepped into his life like a parent, which made things easier, and he and I are very close.  

But I can't deny that until he wore me down from the friend zone, I would not consider dating a single dad."

HumidNebula,technology,1390023642.0,"Additional input is fine, but not for primary. They are just too sloppy and clumsy IMO, especially for text. I'm glad that you can get some use out of the technology. It means that the industry isn't just feeding us fads. But I feel like touchscreens are an imperfect solution to the problem of data entry. They work well assuming that you don't need high precision, because even though screen resolution is increasing, finger resolution hasn't changed in centuries. And, granted, they are easy to figure out how to use. You literally just jam it with your finger.

But still, the simplicity of input makes for simplicity of function. If you make a device that responds to what the user tells it, then that device will naturally have functions dependent on that input. It's like with game consoles. As consoles like the Playstation discovered that having both dual analog joysticks in combination with plenty of buttons made for a wide spectrum of inputs for game developers to work with, PC developers found that a mouse+keyboard combo opened up more options for programming and usability. Both examples have flourished because of that added complexity.  "

There are other aspects of pro hockey dangers not mentioned.  

Skates cut. Throats, faces, achilles tendons, nerves, and arteries.

Pucks break bones, cause massive bruises and cut like a knife.

Here is the face of Terry Sawchuk after a career of stopping pucks as a goalie..

http://icehockeychick.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/sawchuck.gif

Stick work as in where the stick is used to break bones (slashing to arms, fingers, wrists) as well as the cross check from behind to the kidneys, and spearing to the mid section.

There is also the use of the boards as a weapon. One time this guy Chara (6'9""? and around 250 shoves Max Pacioretty into a stanchion, breaks his neck. at or more than a speed around only top sprinters can do. Boarding is where the guy crushes an opponent against the boards when he can't see him coming. Usually compounded with a hit with the stick and or a deliberate attempt to injure the knees.

The best way to tell if a guy in my age played hockey was to see if he had missing teeth and scars on the face.

I loved playing the game. It takes balls.

It is hard to understand just how fast and furious hockey is until you are rink side and this player goes past as fast as 25 mph (much faster than a sprinter) and smacks this one pound hard rubber disk at 100 mph and a player deliberately gets in front of it.

Yer 300 pound linemen crash together from a standing start three feet apart.  Moving maybe 5 mph."

Being bisexual leaning gay, I'm probably the wrong person to ask about ""straight woman porn"" haha but it would probably involve more shots of the male body than the female (in most porn, it's the woman who's featured more heavily), the female actors would have to be MUCH better at faking orgasms (seriously, those girls aren't even trying. I don't know how guys don't realize how fake they sound), and the thing would be more likely to end when the woman orgasms than just when they guy gets in his ""money shot."" Lots fewer shots of women doing things like licking bananas seductively, in favor of shots of men masturbating a little or something. I dunno.

Mostly though general porn just isn't fun for me because when I watch lesbian porn, I can't enjoy it because I'm too distracted by the things they throw in for male enjoyment (like women licking bananas seductively)."

temp9876,women,1390024371.0,"I think they are attributing too much to perceptions.  The only way to have perceptions about a woman changing her name is to know about it.  The only way that happens is if she changes her name AFTER she has established a career.

As it happens I did change my name, and I did it for the very cliche reason mentioned - to share a name with my children.  In my case with a stepchild involved there was only one way to achieve that, and I took it.  With absolutely no pressure from my spouse.  This is absolutely a reflection of my family values, so is it surprising that perception people have of my values is changed by it?

But the name on my business cards is the same name on my degrees.  It is the name I have used to establish my career and most people who know me professionally do not know that I changed my name.

I would be the first to counsel my peers not to change their names, I've done so on many occasions.  It's bad business to give up the name recognition and contacts you've built up to this point.  Of course it will affect you professionally.  

So I am critical of research and articles like this because I suspect they are drawing some unfounded conclusions from the data (although without the data I can hardly make the case).  It is bad business to throw away your brand name.  I would like to see more critical analysis showing these discrepancies between changed names and non, but taking into account when the name change occurred.  

If I changed my name now I honestly believe it would reduce my career prospects.  It's throwing away almost 10 years of networking.  Yet I've seen women do just that so I won't deny there are criticisms to be made.  But I think there is more to it than meets the eye."

I was there with you. I was able to lift the bar but I definitely had the sore arms for a good 3 days after. Felt pretty ashamed especially seeing other people bench upwards of 100 pounds easily while I was there with the bar swaying to and fro. Apparently this has to do with underdeveloped stabilizer muscles. As you keep practicing, they strengthen and you'll be able to lift the bar and add weight. I've just started starting strength and gaining seriously so my stabilizers still haven't developed, but heck, I keep trying.

This is what i'm saying, we're just starting out. Of course we won't be able to lift heavy amounts. When was the last time you lifted 35 lbs from your chest? Probably can't remember?  That's why it's difficult. It's a journey for our muscles as much as it is our minds. Don't be discouraged, stick to the 3 day split, go in everyday and lift the bar for the required amount of sets until it's easy/doable and slowly add 5 lbs every workout. Then you'll get the endorphin rush and it will become addicting to try and lift more weight. We can do this buddy!! :)"

Willravel,SRSFeminism,1390024493.0,"The way I see it, firstly and foremostly I'm responsible for managing myself, regularly self-examining thoughts, words, and actions to analyze them for internalized societal gender norms and expectations which I consciously reject. Am I thinking/saying/doing this because I want to and it's consistent with my principles, or am I thinking/saying/doing this because the societal structures in which I exist have determined this is how I should act? This extends to many things, including sexuality. White heteronormativity, along with cirnormativity and any other structure of normatively based on the privilege part of the axis of privilege and oppression are going to be something we will all have to probably deal with on a regular basis simply because of the saturation of our culture. 

The thing is, though, this is 2014, and I think feminism is mature enough to be sex-positive without the terrible, dishonest baggage society has associated with sexuality, like only white is beautiful or heterosexuality is the only normal or there are only two genders. We can have our cake and eat it, too. All it requires is the same vigilance that being a feminist in general requires, that we have that constant process of self-reflection always running in the background, no matter what we're thinking about or saying or doing. Sure, nobody's perfect and we all make honest mistakes, but as long as we're vigilant, I think we can make good decisions and come to good conclusions, living according to our principles. 

I consider myself to be sex-positive, albeit a bit of a newbie, and I can't imagine sex-positive feminism being used to defend heteronormativity or racial fetishism, as those are exclusionary by their very nature. Sex-positive feminism is about understanding (as in comprehending) that there is healthy sexuality, and that we're entitled to express ourselves in a healthy sexual way without societal constraints. Granted, 'healthy' is a bit of a vague term, but I think we can agree that heteronormativity isn't healthy for people who don't identify as heterosexual, and supports racist structures of oppression, as does racial fetishization. If a guy only dates Asian women and goes around saying he has ""yellow fever"" (ugh), clearly he has an idea in his head that Asian women are appropriate for sexualization whereas women of other races or not. That's not sex-positive, and it's certainly not feminism.

There shouldn't be any physical change in your testicles during sex/orgasm. The actual volume of material generated is negligible (it's just the sperm cells themselves) and that is constant, not arousal-based. The actual fluid we see (semen) is generated further up in your prostate, not your testicles. So if it's more watery, I'd look at other factors like your diet. 

Go see your urologist with your concerns, though. It's possible, as with any operation, that there might be something amiss (like a minor infection). But I'm willing to bet it's mostly psychosomatic, in which case you'll get better as you get acclimated to your situation."

Women's Studies were an attempt to get some female voices into academic study. Now, being a college student, it is my understanding that while course curriculums (curriculi?) are doing a better job of including female voices, male voices are still very well represented. They are always at least half, if not more, of all authors in non-Women's Studies classes. Given that context, can you please explain the point of ""Men's Studies?""

At one point in the game I saw him scrying his top 4 while everyone was looking down at my end of the table trying to determine blockers for a golfer player. At another point I saw him grab something from his graveyard when he was tapped out. Even yet another time I saw him do the ""pick up the top 2 cards"" cheat (where you grab the one directly underneath the top card to make it look like you only grabbed one). I finally got sick of it and called him out after he started making a fuss that he ""didnt understand how a triskellion can kill him by removing counters after he kills it"". Basically he claimed that he didnt understand the stack. What I think he was doing was just bitching and trying to find a way to make himself be right when he wasn't.

EauRougeFlatOut,aviation,1390025993.0,"My job prior to last year was oversight of pilot performance and safety at a rapidly expanding charter airline (if you don't know what that entails, to put it lightly I had plenty of work). The company has a policy of conducting an extensive staff briefing after the investigations of major accidents and significant safety-relevant occurrences in commercial aviation have concluded. AF447 qualified, to say the very least. I'll summarize.

When flying an Airbus, you effectively have 5 control laws to consider. These are Normal Law, Alternate Law 1 (ALT1), Alternate Law 2 (ALT2), Direct Law (DIR), and Mechanical Law. For the purposes of this discussion I will run through the first 3, as DIR and Mechanical Law have little relevance to the discussion.

* Normal Law is exactly what it sounds like. It is the control law that Airbus pilots are most familiar with and do the vast majority of training on. It includes AoA protection, flight envelope limitations such as bank angle and pitch/roll rate, both Vmo and Mmo overspeed protection, as well as windshear protection.

* ALT1 is entered because of a control surface fault or more typically, because of an ADIRU (Air Data Inertial Reference Unit) fault, in AF447's case triggered by a discrepancy due to icing when the ADIRU cross-checked airspeed data between pitot tubes. ALT1 removes high AoA protection and normal-attitude stall protection. 

* ALT2 is entered when faults in two or more ADIRUs are detected. If this happens the autopilot is immediately disconnected, *except in the event of an ADIRU disagree*, meaning that the autopilot will remain connected if any of the three ADIRUs receive conflicting information, or if there is a fault with the ADIRU itself. This is intended to keep a relatively minor redundant computer failure from causing bigger problems. ALT2 removes all envelope protection *except* load factor protection.

When in normal law, it is virtually impossible to enter the aircraft into a stall through pilot input. However because the pitot tubes were obstructed by ice, the ADIRU lost airspeed data. It is not clear to me whether AF447 faulted into ALT1 or ALT2, but the differences are not relevant to the crash. What *is* relevant is that the flight crew failed to recognize that the aircraft had entered an alternate law and continued flying the aircraft as if it still had AoA (stall) protection. 

Because of conflicting pitot information on their PFDs, the pilots became disoriented. Their instinctual reaction was to climb, because they assumed the computer would literally not allow the aircraft to go overspeed, stall, or otherwise exit the nominal flight envelope. Without AoA protection, they out-climbed their engines and put the aircraft into a low-energy stall, which is very hard to recover from at altitude due to extremely limited control surface authority in the absence of airspeed and air density. We know what happens next.

I hope I made myself clear on how the Airbus FBW system contributed to the disorientation of the pilots and the crash. Independent sidesticks had nothing to do with the crash, and for the record are extremely intuitive to use. I wish every aircraft had them.

Edit: Clarity and phrasing."

hylandw,DnD,1390026929.0,"From what I looked up, beacon of hope is an implement power. By level 4, a smart DM would have given you an enchanted implement (probably). For the appropriate modifier of +1, plus 5 for 16 wis, that gives you a +6. However, the stat block for that power that I found online says it's +3 vs. will, so you would thus have a +9. Using MM3 math (the good math), the average monster would have 16 Will (target defence). This means, with your attack, you need to roll a 7 or higher, that's a 65% chance to hit. 4e is designed so that you hit monsters on average 60% of the time. Since this is a daily, you would want a higher probability of a hit. This is balanced.

As for a weapon attack, a fighter might use Cleave (STR vs. AC), and at level 4 with 18 STR and a +1 longsword with +3 proficiency, you would have 4(STR)+1(Enhancement)+3(Prof)=+7 to attack. MM3 math says the average monster has 18 AC at level 4, so you'd need an 11. That's a 45% chance to hit. A fighter targets the big damage-dealers and little minions, so they have a lower AC. Strikers have higher attack modifiers and go for the heavily armoured ones (Rogues, for example, tend to have attacks that go against reflex, which is usually lower).

**TL;DR:** It works."

S-Flo,KillLaKill,1390028917.0,"That's the thing though, Oda Nobunaga wasn't betrayed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (the general who called for reinforcements), he was betrayed by a different general, Akechi Mitsuhide, when he was en route to help Hideyoshi (and had ordered Mitsuhide to also assist Hideyoshi).

Mitsuhide was killed by Hideyoshi a few days after the coup d'etat. Hideyoshi then succeeded his former liege lord.

If they're going to go with the whole Nobunaga thing, then Satsuki will get killed by another general while trying to help out Sanegayama."

We all have a play style we prefer but have decks that definitely are outside of our usual comfort zones. Everybody is pretty easy going and it might help that some of us are judges so the rare times when ruling disputes happen they are settled fairly quickly. As far as attaining it I guess good communication and an easy going attitude. Our decks are probably closer to the competitive side but it keeps the game moving and seems to help keep things in check as far as how outrageous someones deck gets. 

Tldr; We're easy going with competitive decks and we tend to have good communication with each other."

racistsfuckoff,socialism,1390029051.0,"The mining tax is a perfect example of why I do not think capitalism can be reformed away. Even pathetic reforms like the mining tax, which really don't provide *huge* benefit for workers or *huge* detriment for bosses, are struck down immediately, as they are totally unacceptable to capitalists. More moderate reforms which aren't immediately rejected are reversed over time, or circumnavigated.

The only way to bring about socialism permanently is a workers revolution. This brings us to your first problem - most workers don't want socialism right now. However, clearly the consciousness of the working class shifts, as there have been times and places in history where the majority of the working class did want socialism. Look at refugee policy here in Australia. In 2007, not so long ago, the majority of Australians elected Kevin Rudd on a pro-refugee platform. Today in 2014, the majority of Australians polled think Tony Abbott is not being harsh enough on refugees. Consciousness is not permanent, in very short periods of time it can change, and changes at an accelerated rate in times of struggle. Our job as socialists is to be agitating, making these arguments to people in our workplaces and schools, and building strong socialist organisations with good politics, so we can intervene when struggle happens."

memnos,Pathfinder_RPG,1390030776.0,"Have you read the rest of this AP? One thing I wished I changed when running HoH is to introduce BBEG earlier. Not as an antagonist, but as a friend of prof. Lorrimor. He should have come to the funeral and met with the players. You may also want to find a way to introduce [Auren Vrood](/spoiler) in this chapter so the players know who's behind the killing. My players left Revengro without the sense of purpose. They didn't know anything about Whispering Way except for what they found in the books. Having a face or at least a name to ask around for could give them a common goal after HoH (and it is a good way to introduce new player characters to the team in following chapters if someone dies. Nothing bring people together like common enemy).

If your players are experienced with the Pathfinder/D&amp;D and you are confident that they will survive it you may want to encourage them to go to the prison early. Mine spent over a week in Revengro and didn't enter the main building until they found everything there was to be find about it in the books. It made for a couple of pretty boring sessions. Thankfully the random creepy, paranormal events set the mood great in the beginning.

Other than that I found the Trust system completely useless and would recommend ditching it.

Similarly self-reliant Saul went on a religious tear and wore his men down, but one of them (unaware of the sanctions) took up some honey and received strength.


Joshua stopped what he was doing in the middle of a war campaign to worship.  He was generally pretty smart too, with both God and winning territory.

On a serious note though Ice Climbers wouldn't work without a serious overhaul (why would you call it ice climbers then?) because the level design would suck on a widescreen TV, unless you divided it in 2 for a 4 player vs mode/2vs2/some other split screen thing. What I am trying to say is using full width would make those games near impossible or they would have to be easied up hard.

Largely, the game is a thought-provoking/fun exercise in creativity and leisure but can be an awful time-sink (to say nothing of money and energy.)


Honestly you could have more fun of the some kind by reading the Greyhawk novels.  (This is also extremely cost-efficient for the time and energy involved.)  They really are quite satisfying.  White Plume Mountain was probably my favorite.


Just saw this earlier: ""everything created by God is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, since it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.""  Your mind and imagination are fun, terrific things blessed of God and designed for eternally noble purposes.  Exercise them in the fear of the Lord, and you can have a fun time.


But like anything else, watch for the works of the flesh and be wise.


GTA, for reference, is a cesspit of abominable evil that construes no constructive benefit to anyone.  Beginning to play one of their earlier games was actually one of the worst decisions of my life.  It led to a terrible attitude, much lost sleep, and a great number of sinful acts that rendered damage to relationships still remaining today."

Confidence is key, if you don't like pictures of yourself, a simple change of angle might help, and stay confident! You've got great bone structure and i love your nose. Contouring/highlighting might make you like your pictures more too.

Elder Scrolls games also don't give quite so much life to your character. He/she is essentially mute, and cutscenes have more of an in-game feeling, which can make people pay much less attention to dialogue and therefore much less attention to character building. Elder Scrolls can't have a canon because Elder Scrolls doesn't have a main character. But I'm just being needlessly academic.

If we were discussing academic feminism and sociology, I might bring up the fact that these are probably so pervasive because porn is shot through the male gaze (meaning males have the active gaze/it's by men, for men) so therefore the porn is ""over"" when the male orgasms, rather than when the female does. Therefore the money shot is a simple way to show that it's done with. The male got his rocks off; you can wipe yourself off now.

Personally I think there are some good money shots out there that I rather enjoy, but I always wish the porn could progress from there. Have him show some common courtesy and finish her off, etc."

Anyway, it actually seems like the NYX loose shadows apply more smoothly  and give a brilliant finish than the Stila ones. I know the Stila ones can be a bit finicky though, did you swatch them bare or with the mixing medium?

Either way, I know it was mentioned on here due to someone's FoTD with the NYX loose shadows that they might be a good alternative to the Stila ones and I'm really glad to see these swatches and your haul!

Otherwise, is there any chance you may have forgotten to upload swatches of the NYX baked blushes and/or I'm missing seeing them in the album? :) I'd love to see them!"

If they stick you are innovative and changing the landscape of gaming, if it doesn't it's derided as a gimmick. That was why the GameCube died in the arse, no actual new features, no reason to buy it unless you were a fanboy. That's why the Wii succeeded instead of us seeing Nintendo doing their own version of exiting the console market, because it had innovative features. The only reason modern gaming seems gimmicky to you is because it's new. I was looking after some young kids the other day and try asked if they could play some of my games so I got out the 'cube.

BonzoTheBoss,funny,1390035640.0,"Small clarification:

&gt;the Queen of Great Britain holds the ultimate power over us. 

The Queen of *Cananda* holds ultimate power over you. The Queen of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Queen of Canada are two seperate titles. They just happen to be held by the same person.

According to the *Staff of Canadian Monarchist News, ed. (2013).*, the cost CAD$57,000,000 in 2013, or $1.53 per Canadian citizen. 

Keep in mind that this isn't just money given to the Queen to do with as she pleases, according to [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20080619203100/http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costofcrown.html) article that money pays for her her official expenses as Queen of Cananda and her roles in that respect abroad (i.e. that money does not pay for her duties in any of the other Commonwealth Realms), along with the governor general and ten lieutenant governors as instruments of the Queen's authority, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonies, and the like.

You also have to consider that those costs won't just evapourate the instant a republic is adopted. Those costs are for the official head of state, whether that is a monarch or an elected official. Technically I would imagine it would cost *more* because you have to pay for extra elections every few years!

Also, I think it's an exaggeration to say she has ""ultimate power"". She (and her representative) can theoretically dismiss the government or withhold Royal Assent to new legislation, but to use such powers would be political suicide. Everyone knows that would result in the removal of the monarchy. Royal Assent hasn't been withheld (in England) since 1708! And the only time I know of the government being dismissed is during the [1975 Australian Constitutional Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis). (Which technically doesn't apply, as we're talking about the Queen of Canada, not the Queen of Australia!)

My point is the monarchy has very little actual effect on the governing of Canada. Candian laws, policies and the everyday running of the country are presided over by the democratically elected government of Cananda, wherein the PM advises the Queen on who to appoint as Governor General. She isn't the head of an evil empire bent on the domination and ruination of the common folk, it is to this day a very ceremonial position with little no effect on the lives of Canadian citizens."

That said, I would go for a rogue, bard, or monk. Because I think that would make the most interesting story. 

Bard can do everything kinda well, but nothing good, might be just what you need though. has healing/controlling/skillmonkey and is sturdier than a mage character.

Rogue, go with use magic device and you can do quite a lot, as long as you avoid fights not looking favorable for you. It will be   quite fun to play. 

Monk, I don't know I just like monk I think. But he has movement and stealth and might be a bit better off in combat compared to the rogue. Has less skills though. "

Bronzer is made to be, well..bronzer. Some girls have the skin tone to get away with using it for enhancing dem cheekbones but most do not. There are plenty of products for contouring out there and some that aren't made for it but suffice well (ie. for pale girls, quite a few use nyx's blush in taupe).

psychicsword,PoliticalDiscussion,1390036993.0,It is really hard to prove those kinds of things when it isn't discrimination against a single specific group of people. For instance it is possible to prove that they discriminate against women when they higher exclusively men for some positions over multiple better qualified women but it is really hard to prove that they are discriminating against potential risk factors like the possibility of needing government assistance because there are millions of different groups that fit that description.

FewRevelations,FeMRADebates,1390037077.0,"The problem with everything you're saying is that we can't gauge how popular porn for women would be while we inhabit a society that is bereft of such porn. I'd assure you that it's likely that an equal number of women would watch porn if A) women weren't taught to be ashamed of their sexuality in our culture (for example, women don't talk about masturbating, and women who do masturbate initially feel that they have done something deeply wrong, whereas men are more accepting of masturbation to the point that they are expected to be doing it incessantly) and B) porn was also made for them. However, since we don't live in that reality, many women may say that they're uninterested in porn, even porn made for women, because they don't know what they're missing out on.

It's similar to how the comic book/superhero industry is aimed so clearly at males, especially at younger ages. Following cultural trends to make everything by men for men first, comic books tend to appeal to males exclusively (even female superheroes, long known to be *comically* oversexualized, are clearly made more for male audiences, on average). Now the comic book industry is saying there's no point in making superheroes for girls because girls aren't interested in superheroes. But why would girls express interest en masse for something that was targeted at boys? However there's clear evidence that girls are fully capable of liking superheroes made for their demographic; take the extreme popularity of the Powerpuff Girls and Sailor Moon as an example.

My point is that these industries, like video games, porn, and comic books, that everyone says are for males, are enforcing female disinterest by asserting that females are disinterested and therefore making no effort to reach out to female audiences. It's a self-feeding cycle."

Not that I don't enjoy playing games like that. I just don't think it's as successful of a storytelling mechanism.

I married at 20 and she a month and a half shy of her 19th birthday so she was 18 ATT. Getting married was, and never will be the worst decision of my life, I was very much in love with her. the worst decision of my life currently was that i LET the horrible marriage go on for so long and was constantly trying to fix something that could never BE fixed.

I can't see the future so I don't know how long. You might take it to a transmission shop and have them look at it. In fact I would probably just do that, because trying to diagnose a transmission problem particularly a sound, over the internet isn't a substitute for a diagnostics and road test. I can just tell you what I know from building transmissions and going by your description.

If you are mechanically inclined and have tools and a jack and a jack stand you could take the transmission pan off and see if there's any metal or contaminants in the pan. that would give you a better idea."
midgaze,stopdrinking,1390038784.0,"It's key for me to have specific things to remember that happen just about every time I drink. Then, when I feel that familiar pull, I can remind myself what it's actually like to drink. The memories of good times are misleading. The actual experience is different, and when I remember specific aspects of the reality of it, I no longer want that drink.

It also helps me to remember that I am different, and can't compare myself to normal drinkers. Their experience when drinking alcohol is different than mine is or can ever be. Sure, it's fun for them still. It's not fun for me anymore. For very specific reasons a, b, and c.

I think for a while there I was chasing after the memory of good times when I drank, but wasn't able to get there very often, if ever, anymore. I got to a certain point and I just don't get it back, and a drying out period doesn't help with that. It has changed because I have changed. If I were to go back to drinking I would imagine it would just be worse."

JIVEprinting,Christianity,1390039930.0,"First thing, never look on Google or Reddit for spiritual topics.  You are literally better off inquiring of homeless drug addicts or jail inmates.  A library would be a much better resource than either.


As to your answer, I think it'd be helpful to see what the Bible says about the human heart.  I'll leave that to you.


A couple of your points are mistaken.


Man's sinful nature is xplained in Galatians, especially chapter 5, and Romans.  There is a lot wrong with the view expressed in point 5, although I do understand it is normal in western culture.  It just happens to be grossly mistaken.  Rather than pick it apart, I'll submit you the alternative below.


God allows evil in the world (for now) because the alternative is obliterating you.  And he loves you.  He loves when you think carefully.  He made you to do that; a lot of people don't do that!


I think your premise really turns on point 9.  Here's something the Bible says: *To justify the wicked and he to condemn the righteous, both alike are an abomination to the Lord.*


But that's exactly what the Gospel is!  *For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.*


It is deeply unfair, yes.  For anyone at all to turn from sin requires God's explicit rescue.  One hundred percent of humanity rejected God, and by rights that's how many should be cut off.  But he decides to save some.  Does that mean he's a jerk for not saving them all?  I don't think so.  And I'm hardly in a position to complain!


Here's what Romans says: *What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not!  For He tells Moses:  I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  So then it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy.  For the Scripture tells Pharaoh: I raised you up for this reason so that I may display My power in you and that My name may be proclaimed in all the earth.  So then, He shows mercy to those He wants to, and He hardens those He wants to harden.  You will say to me, therefore, “Why then does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?”  But who are you, a mere man, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?”  Or has the potter no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor?  And what if God, desiring to display His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath ready for destruction?  And what if He did this to make known the riches of His glory on objects of mercy that He prepared beforehand for glory — on us, the ones He also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?*



I can say with reasonable confidence that God understands more about justice than either one of us.  More importantly, he can save you from your sins.  And then you can offer that salvation to others -- it's free!


What's so darn bad about that?"

It's the same school of thought that tells young boys that the best way to get girls to like them is to be nice to them without mentioning that they also have to be exciting, interesting and attractive.

Often seems to be spread by mothers, aunts, grandmothers, female teachers and other older women who seem to assume that unless this message is hammered into the mind of a young boy he will become a misogynist pig.

It's kind of two different and equally harmful extremes. The one I described was definitely more common around me when I was growing up (but luckily it wasn't the only message I got, if it was I would've had some issues to deal with)."

axehomeless,AskReddit,1390042245.0,"Never hought I could participate in something like this, bu I Almost drowned in cave.

So a friend of mine asked me if we can go hiking in a cave on the schwäbische alb. We would need a neopren because you hike through water which is cold like fuck and at some point you maybe even have to swim a little bit to get through. So we went in there, walked around, it obviously was completly dark, only the light of our head mounted torches was illuminating something. After an hour we came to a point where the ceiling gradually got lower and lower to the point where we had to lie in the water and realized that ceiling to water was about 5cm. We hadn't anticipated that much water and weren't prepared for it, if our torches get wet and go out, we're practically lost, no way out there without.

So we turned around and went home. Two weeks later we came back with a backpack full of tripple secured torches, just in case, and started hiking. When we arrived the spot, we noticed that water was even higher now, leaving no room of air between the rock ceiling and the water. We decided that I should have a look, we came this far again and we weren't going to turn around and just go home. 
SO I gave him the backpack, but my torch in my hand, got under there and pushed myself through, following the little rope that was there for orientation. I reached the other side, breathed, turned around and said ""no problems, around 3-5 meters and we're there. 

So I didn't want the backpack getting in the way on my back, so I decided to out him between my legs. A big mistake because that's excactly what happened. I tried going through again, the backpack got in my face, I could see the rope and thought ""oh how big can this be, just keep going, you're nearly there.

30s later, my feet hit rock. I was on the other side, but there was no air. I looked around, nothing to see but milky, cold water and rock. No up, no down, no surface, no air. I had to make the decision to look for the other side or go back, I went back. after 50s and my pulse rising I thought to myself ""so this is how people die, this is how it ends."" Only thing I thought was how easy it is to make the one trivially wrong decision that may cost you everything.

A few seconds later I saw light and the surface again, I got out, breathed heavily, realized that I just survived and my friend asked me with the lightest tone I have ever heard ""Is something wrong?"" ""yes it is, I thought I was drowning.""

Needless to say, we went through and continued our hike, but I really didn't enjoy the rest of the trip.

two years ago or so, I saw the trailer for sanctum, the James cameron movie, It felt like I was back there, really interesting feeling. "

atheistium,ffxiv,1390042526.0,"One thing that's I've experienced in my FC an xiv is that people don't like being told their doing stuff wrong but if you're telling them at the time or maybe after it's happened a few times they can learn easier. It's a much smoother way of getting the kinks out.

When I was learning people made several comments about things I was screwing up on when I was in instances and so then I could see exactly what I was doing wrong as I was doing it. It was a huge learning curve for me and now I've gone from really under performing in coil to being just under the same level as our most experienced bard. I hit pretty much the same DPS and we enjoy joking around with parsers now in DPS races (we're weird).

It's made a huge difference to my attitude of playin with people. I point out silly mistakes after the odd wipe but it's not always welcome. It's never in a rude way ofc but people get really offended sometimes. I'm maybe just lucky I don't get personal when it comes to learning.

Though I run with one WHM who is struggling with a few things and while he asks for people to tell him if he's screwing up, he seems to take it personally when these things are pointed out. I remember saying we were going to do an extreme mob one time and he wanted to join but we had been doing it for 2-3 hours trying to work it out ourselves. I said that he'd missed a bit and maybe after we've beaten it he could join. He got offended but his movement is really slow. He really struggles with plumes in Titan hm but always blames others for his mistakes. I understand healing is difficult with multitasking but if you're wanting to do harder content with people you kind of have to see what you're weak at (especially when ppl point it out) and work at it :)

I'm for regulation rather than the (perceived) hard line of ""control"" but I do like some of the safety measures Australia has.

1) Registration of firearms allows police to track the weapons with greater ease if they are stolen of misused.

2) Requirement to keep the firearms in a regulated heavy safe, where the ammunition can't be stored in a magazine, and the weapon(s) have to be stored separate to the ammunition (two different compartments, generally with different locks and doors).

3) Restricting use of firearms to ""legitimate"" need, so hunters, sporting shooters, recreational shooters (Australia doesn't appear to have this, but I'm cool with it) and farmers. Owning a firearm for ""home defense"" isn't legitimate as more often than not the user doesn't have enough training to adequately use the weapon in a defensive manner, secondly; guns are tools for killing as such they are an aggressive weapon, a shield is a defensive weapon."

I remember the pressure of getting dreads down, rooks down, the ordering felt intense. In fact turn 2 for me as a bard felt intense at points. Done it so many times now though haha

Turn 5 is one of the mixed turns. I'd say it's a harder fight for healers and tanks purely because of how much DMG death sentence throws out but the conflags, dive bombs, dread knights and burn phases, the DPS has plenty to be looking after. 

There are plenty of fights where tanks do bugger all and the healer pops the odd aoe heal, DPS make the fight quicker and if fights are going slow you're DPS is the problem.

We do turn 4 and never hit the aoe enrage at the end anymore. Feels good still :D

I think DPS have less I think in terms of health and aggro mechanics because two other types are looking after that but we can all watch or aggro and most self-heal to a degree. I have ot make sure I don't have certain CDs down for phases or even up for others. We have to do the most movement (though typically so do healers).

Maldevinine,booksuggestions,1390044124.0,"The two biggest names in space opera are **Foundation** by Isaac Asimov and **Dune** by Frank Herbert. Both are incredible reads but mostly for the ideas behind the novels rather then beautiful prose. The first series that I can seriously call space opera is the **Lensman** series by E. E. ""Doc"" Smith. Written back in the 20's so incredibly rare now.

Anyway, enough history. Peter F. Hamilton's later works are more hard science then the Night's Dawn trilogy. I can't remember names and they are not on my shelf. Be prepared for absolute doorstoppers of novels, coming in at around 400,000 words.

Alistair Reynolds has his **Revelation Space** series of novels which drift in and out of space opera depending on the specific novel. I find that he writes too much like a thriller author to be really good at the space opera, but you may enjoy that. It's exactly the same description I would give of Charles Stross. Stross at least branches out more with fantasy and specific thriller novels.

I haven't seen much from Neal Asher recently but his **Polity** novels are definitely space opera, and decent examples of the genre. **Line War** while being one of the later novels in the series is the best example.

David Weber's **Honor Harrington** novels are also space opera, but I haven't read them. Be warned, the guy does not know how to say ""Finished"" and his series can go on forever.

For a person who does know when to finish a story, Kevin J. Anderson. Plenty of people dislike him for the simplistic nature of his plots and writing, but he can male a metaplot and stick to it, something that many other supposedly better writers cannot. Recent releases from him are **The Saga of the Seven Suns** and **Hellhole**.

Sean Williams has his name on two separate series, **Geodesica** and **Astropolis**. Geodesica is a bit simplistic but still very interesting while Astropolis goes off the deep end with the ""What it means to be human"" question.

Lastly a very new name for the genre is Gavin Smith with **The Age of Scorpio**. Very bleak and I hated all the characters, so I gave up on reading. If reading about a bunch or arseholes doing arseholish things to one another sounds interesting across multiple time periods, then it might be worth reading."

I don't think it's grasping at straws to say that I'd need inspiration and a desire to be in the industry to make porn. It's a valid part of people who are in the industry. Granted these are different aspects than the others, since they're internal, but that doesn't invalidate them.

I don't think it's fair to say it's entirely women's fault that there's a dearth of female-oriented porn. I think it's the fault of (genderless) Society. Our culture teaches women to be ashamed of their sexuality, so it's against gender role pressures to go into the porn industry. Women further enforce this by slut-shaming all women associated with porn and demonizing the industry as purely exploitative. However we also can't ignore how difficult it is for women to get into male-dominated industries; women have been trying to get into comic books for ages, and while they've been very successful at the indie level, major publications are still ignoring females. And let's face it: indie vs mainstream certainly doesn't denote quality, but it does denote audience size and success levels."

You're of course right that race and gender othering are not perfect parallels to each other, but they are similar concepts at the core.

I think while it's true that men are othered in certain places, those places are not the ones that your (our?) definition of patriarchy says gives male privilege. Where men are othered are the places that women have been relegated power, but the concept of patriarchy seems to consider those places less... important. At the very least I think that othering women in pop culture can be detrimental to young females growing up, as it teaches them that women are secondary and precludes giving them many role models.

spongebib,MorbidReality,1390046431.0,"I used to spend a little time looking at communities like this back in the early to mid 2000s. I was never actively involved in them and was actually just looking for support groups and spaces for topics like self-harm, but the two types of communities were sometimes somewhat intertwined. 

It always really disturbed me to see so many people on the pro-ana/mia sites trying to encourage these horribly unhealthy eating habits. There were so many young people on there who were being convinced that they should want an eating disorder. The people who run those kinds of sites really romanticize the disorders by giving them names and writing poetic pieces about them. It makes me kind of angry because I find it very irresponsible and toxic, but at the same time...it also just makes me sad. The people running these sites and involving themselves with them must be really quite lonely, whether or not they had or have an eating disorder. It seemed like they were trying to fill a void or find some people to talk to. It seemed like they had low opinions of themselves and thought they could solve that by starving themselves. Maybe they'd been bullied or ignored. Some of them had been sexually assaulted or abused. A lot of them were perfectionists. Many of them engaged in other self-destructive habits. 

I also knew of a few communities where young girls would share pictures of their emaciated bodies (and post their stats: starting weight (SW), current weight (CW), ultimate goal weight (UGW), etc.). It was really sad seeing all of those pictures... I just know that it inspired competition among the girls, which is obviously really dangerous. I think that there's a fine line with some communities dedicated to the self-destructive behaviors involved with things like eating disorders and self-harm. I think that it's great to have support, especially on an anonymous platform among like-minded people, because these topics are still quite taboo in society and aren't easy to talk about. Having a space for venting or discussion can be helpful. However, I think that picture-sharing communities and whatnot really do walk that very fine line. It can be a bit liberating to share your secrets with people who understand, but on the other hand...it can make things worse for a lot of people. People might look at others' pictures and think, ""wow, she's skinnier than I am. I need to be more like her,"" or they might see pictures of self-harm wounds and think, ""wow, that person's wounds are deeper than mine. Mine must not matter, so I need to go deeper.""

Anyway, I guess I'm rambling a lot. It's just something I've always found interesting but also quite sad. These environments are extremely toxic, and even the best support groups for these kinds of topics sometimes walk a fine line. They can be very useful, but they can also be unhealthy sometimes too."

Plus, truthfully, ""sales"" is not even remotely the only criterion publishers and agents use to decide what books to accept: personal taste factors in very strongly too.

There's a pretty detailed few chapters on this - the Sparknotes version: one of the space chimps was a prodigious masturbator but didn't actually jerk it in space; there was a porn that was rumored to have had one scene shot in zero-g on a parabolic flight but that was disproven (the actress' breasts didn't float); in zero gravity your blood flow is concentrated above your waist, so space boners are actually softer than their earth counterparts. Astronauts have often used those food tubes (like, the squirty packs of applesauce) as makeshift fleshlights, but actually having PIV in space comes with its own massive limitations - it's really hard to get a thrusting rhythm going without somewhere to anchor yourself. So thus far, no one has *admitted* to having successfully had sex in space - though the book was published in 2010, so that may very well have changed by now."

Rape is committed far more often than false rape accusations are, and there are still so many fucked-up attitudes in society about rape that lead to victim-blaming, lack of prosecution, etc. I don't blame women who are wary or concerned with their own safety. I'm sure it sucks to be a decent guy and feel like some women out there don't trust you, but that isn't quite the same as the very real fear many women have of being raped/sexually assaulted. Many times it's been more than just a fear for them.

In the end, not many women *actually* hold it against all men that many men are rapists, but you also can't blame women who've actually been assaulted for being cautious or nervous. I also think that a lot of people are just venting about how frustrating and painful some of this can be for them. Perhaps I'm admittedly quite biased in favor of rape victims and women who have the very real fear of being assaulted vs. the misogynistic MRAs who live to derail topics and insult people, but I just don't think that these two examples are perfectly comparable and it sort of feels like you're engaging in derailing. I'm sure it sucks to feel like some women don't trust you, but don't you see that it also sucks for women who've been assaulted in the past or who have been put into dangerous situations and have a hard time trusting others?"

Sir_Dude,rit,1390049795.0,"I was in a fraternity (won't say which one though).

A) Cost varies from house to house, the majority of this cost goes to pay for insurance. Everyone has seen 'Animal House' and fraternities are hot targets for lawsuits. The dues you pay insure you and your house in case someone sues. Your national organization will assess how risky your chapter is each year and will adjust the insurance based on that (you and your brothers split the cost as your dues).

Another part of cost goes to pay for 'activities,' occasionally we would include formal events (like overhead for fundraisers or alumni dinners) as part of dues or sometimes these expenses are out of pocket and as the year goes. It varies from house to house.

B) At the beginning of every Fall and Spring ~~quarter~~ semester (get off my lawn) you will see giant banners hanging around the residential side that advertise 'Rush' events that each house holds, go to these and get to know the brothers, from this you make your decision.

C) Time wise, I held a job before, during, and after pledging, it isn't a problem and most fraternities/sororities prefer you have a job (shows you're responsible). Also, your GPA is averaged with the rest of your chapter, so they want you to succeed academically too. I was able to accomplish all of this without issue.

D) Lets say that I have a group of pledges and I tell them that they are required to memorize and recite pieces of the local and national fraternity history (who, when, and how we were founded) in order to become members. **RIT considers this to be hazing**.

Let's say that I have a group of pledges and I tell them that they are required to memorize and recite the names, hometowns, majors, and graduation year of every active member (~30) in order to become members. **RIT considers this to be hazing**.

Setting any kind of 'condition' or 'requirement' to become a member is considered hazing. That said, all fraternities will claim to be anti-hazing. You will simply have to see what the pledging process involves, what you feel comfortable with, and bail immediately if you feel uncomfortable. (FYI, the days of making pledges fuck a goat/sheep (or similar nonsense) ended a long time ago).


From what I heard around campus, most of the hazing that actually occurs today (based on RIT's definitions of Hazing) is:

* Making pledges clean up after a party

* Making pledges create new 'rush' banners

* Making pledges organize a charity/fundraiser

* Making pledges be a designated driver during parties

* Making pledges memorize and recite chapter/national info

* Requiring pledges show respect to brothers, alumni, little sisters/sweethearts/sorority affiliates

Initiation is usually where you swear an oath to follow certain standards (which you learn about during pledging). You might get paddled once at the very end, but everyone is laughing about it at that point (including you)."

I know that because even a guy like me, who loves and wants kids, and has experience with kids, and is completely open to the idea of helping to raise a child who already has a father... I still have reservations about joining a family that started without me. I would have to have a connection with you and your child, and be sure that your relationship with your child and your relationship with the child's father were healthy and respectful. If I'm getting into a family relationship, it has to be healthy or I'm out. Even the ""baby daddy"" relationship is something that will affect me for years to come, so it **is** a big deal.

There was a 12"" snow fall in Quebec City in early June. Temperatures in the state of New York were recorded to be below freezing every day in May.

Lluxx,changemyview,1390052927.0,"&gt; Someone, at some point, is going to notice that and be pretty ruffled about it. 

Let me just clarify this. You're saying that it is perfectly acceptable to kick a trans kid out of their home, to fire them for being trans, to insult them on the street, to physically attack them and even to murder them, because they are 'lying' to you? 

&gt; It's pretty simple--what chromosomes do you have? Well then, that's your gender. If, by some fluke of nature you have both in equal proportion, then you are genderless

True hermaphrodites are very rare, but do exist. Who are you to tell them they can't choose to present themselves as they wish? If a hermaphrodite feels like a woman and so presents as one and calls herself 'she', would you tell her that, no, she must call herself 'it' and dress and act only with complete equality between the masculine and the feminine. 

Also, intersex individuals are very much real and well-documented. [This documents a few common cases, including hermaphrotidism](http://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html#Hermaphroditism). Let's talk about Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. 

&gt; individuals have external female genitalia and breast development despite being genetically male (46XY)

So that means that there are women out there - with breasts and vaginas who look perfectly normal and feminine - who actually have XY chromosomes. You might have met them and been lied to already. What should we do about that? Should everyone get their chromosomes tested immediately and carry a card around to prove to others they aren't lying with their appearance? Should we root out individuals who look female (there is also a male equivalent, so let's not forget about them) and tell them that they are lying and deserve to be harrassed for it unless they immediately disregard their upbringing, their genitalia, their preferences and start acting male right now. If you turned out to have a condition like this, would you instantly drop your entire socialisation, your hormones and all your feelings about being male (if you are female, swap the genders around) and change sexes? You'd have to transition, of course, which you don't like, but surely that would be better than lying to people about your chromosomes, no matter how male you look, act and feel?

What about children who underwent surgery at birth for being intersex? They didn't have a say in that, of course, but they're still lying and according to you we have every right to be ruffled when we find out. Perhaps we should make them carry a sign? Or reverse the surgery so that their genitals are not usable? 

Or maybe these individuals don't bother you. ""Well, if they look like women and have breasts and vaginas and act like women, they're not lying"", you might argue. So what about a transwoman who passes very well? Let's say she's lucky with her face and height and the surgery has made her indistinguishable from a non-trans woman. She might have XY chromosomes, but functionally she is a woman, just like the women we were talking about earlier. Is that then acceptable? 

If it is acceptable, does that mean you only have a problem with trans people struggling to pass? Nobody's forcing you to date them, though, so why is it acceptable to remind them that they don't pass as well as luckier trans people? Should we also tell ugly or disfigured people that they are lying to themselves and will always be ugly, but then tell them not to attempt to fix the problem with cosmetic surgery?

It's pretty clear that you don't like trans people. What you put as acceptable ""repercussions"" for transitioning are absolutely horrible; violence and harrassment. You seem to treat suicide as a perfectly valid option for them, which doesn't seem surprising considering that you dislike them for having gender dysphoria but also believe they shouldn't be able to recitify that without consequences.

However, ultimately who gives a fuck if somebody says they're male or female or something in between? It isn't hurting you. Their genitals or their chromosomes are none of your business. 'Male' and 'female' are not exclusive clubs that we have right to deny people do. They are just descriptions. And, let's face it, if you say 'My boss is male', you are not referring to his chromosomes (unless you actually do ask for proof from everybody you meet); you're saying he looks masculine to you and you would assume he has a penis. Why can't it be the same for trans people? If they look masculine or feminine after transitioning (and their genitals are still none of your business, but we can assume they have the usual ones for the gender they are presenting as). How come chromosomes are suddenly so important for them when for everybody else all that matters is their vagina or penis and how they choose to dress?

Edit because I forgot to add:

If you have chronic tonsillitis and want to meditate your way out of it, fine. Whatever. Enjoy the pain and pus every month or two and try not to take antibiotics in case it messes with the learning about yourself. But if someone else wants to actually do something about their problems and use modern medicine to rectify it, I would choose to respect them for being proactive rather than condemn them for it. If someone is suffering and for their own reasons - such as you and the tonsillitis - decides to continue with it, then I wouldn't condemn them for it as long as they're not harming anyone else. But if someone decides to actually to try fix their problems, I would never say that they deserve negative consequences for that. If someone was in agony from tonsillitis that just keeps coming back, though, I would tell them to look into the surgery that has results, not pursue some spiritual path which has zero proven results. It just strikes me as basic human decency to live and let live in that way. 

&gt; Never said they had to. 

You did by default by saying they deserve to suffer by society if they choose to alleviate their mental suffering. You would also recommend, if asked, that they continue to suffer internally. So no, they don't have to, but you would recommend that they do. 

&gt; I would say that your tonsils were likely affected by some deeply held belief such that it manifested in your body and you had to have them removed. I would then say ""This was likely not necessary if you had meditated"". 

I would then argue that my tonsils were affected by a proven sensitivity to the bacteria which causes tonsilitis and ask you to back up your claims. However, since you are incredibly reluctant to provide any empirical evidence to support your arguments against transitioning, I would assume you'd be unable to. 

Honestly, I like to play the violin. I find it soothing, it helps me not to stress and it gives me time to think. I would never, however, recommend that anybody with a mental or physical illness take up the violin instead of seeking help for their issues.

amitarvind,Scotch,1390053161.0,"This is not my first single malt but I was so excited after drinking this one, I had to share!

ABV: 43%

Price: $48

   **Appearance**: Amber

   **Nose**: Camphor, peat, some vague hint of fruit floating in the background.
 
   **Taste**: Peat and smoke in your face! Followed quickly by the camphor/medicinal flavor.  After a few minutes and a few sips, I started to pick out the wood, which lent a really nice character to it.

   **Feel**: Smooth oily feel, with a hint of graininess (which makes me think I was imagining it.)

   **Finish**: Long, slow exit of smoke. I actually found it mellow and was strongly reminded of lapsang souchong tea, which I also like drinking.

   **Score**: 89/100

**Overall**- 

I was actually afraid I wouldn't like this as my first single malt was the Glenlivet 12 (which I'll go back and review later, along with the others.)  I actually enjoyed this so much, I killed off about 7-8 fingers worth after opening it!  I've officially fallen in love with Islay."

Jacksambuck,PurplePillDebate,1390053441.0,"It's probable most women look better to the average man with long rather than short hair. Doesn't mean there aren't exceptions, of course. And no one has an obligation to look a certain way to strangers.


&gt;There seems to be an assumption that long hair is a sign of fertility, but I don't think that's actually true.

It doesn't matter whether it's true or not, or was true at some point. It's not because Nature configured us one way that we have to follow. Otoh, it's not because Nature's reasons aren't legitimate that we can break free from its constraints. It's like sweets: pleasurable to eat thanks to Nature, but rationnally bad for you. So the question becomes: Is it rationnally bad to prefer long-haired women? Imo it's somehow arbitrary, but the damage is minimal, not comparable to liking sweets and fats.

&gt; Do you consider short hair on women to be a sign of passive aggression or even active defiance against men?

It can be a sign of unwillingness to compromise with men, rejecting gender roles, feministy stuff (which is a *huge* minus for me), but I don't interpret it as such by default. It can also be a sign of non-superficiality and independence, which I respect and appreciate as a personal trait (still comes at some cost of *physical* attractiveness for me though). Sort of the opposite of breast enhancement surgery. Increases my physical attractiveness to them, lowers my opinion of their character."

thedictatorscut,MakeupAddiction,1390054347.0,"&gt; I also just generally take issue with wealthy white people critiquing hop hop culture by calling it materialistic and shallow (Royals), but that's not really related.

Yeah, I still don't think that particular criticism really holds up. There are, what, two references to anything that can be strictly pinpointed as ""hip-hop culture"" in the entire song (gold teeth, Maybachs), and the rest is pretty evenly aimed at rock-and-roll/pop music and other forms of media (what claim does hip-hop alone have on ""bloodstains,"" ""ballgowns,"" or ""tigers on a gold leash""?). Meanwhile, it's not even a direct criticism *of* the materialism inherent in those worlds - it's filtered through a lens of ""This is marketed by huge corporate interests to teens halfway across the world, and they just accept it and appropriate it to party and look cool."" It's essentially a criticism of how media flows work - about how silly it is to embrace and aspire to a lifestyle that couldn't be more removed from your real life.

It's really simplistic and speaks to a lack of nuance to just say ""Oh, that song is about how hip-hop music is tacky and bad, so therefore it's super racist."" That song isn't a direct criticism of hip-hop culture, even though a lot of people seem to read it as one."

Shouldn't the incredible part be how far away from the linear regression a given team is? That would give a metric on converting yards into points. I think the Broncos would still be great doing this but presently it just shows you should aim for the highest quantity yards.
OmniaMors,progun,1390054790.0,"their points flaws are

1. they use firearm homicide rate. again this is only half the story, this excludes every instance a homicide was *prevented* by a gun, so they should use total homicide rates. Also homicide includes ""justifiable homicide"". lets say you have a scenario where A is trying to rape B. if A rapes B you have 1 rape and 0 homicides. if B kills A with a firearm when A is trying to rape B then you have 0 rape and 1 homicide. if you only count homicides you are arguing that **letting A rape B is a better scenario**.

2. they also forget guns save people by their own logic. about 1.4 million DGUs a year including 200,000 women stopping rape and sexual assault. they are, again, only looking at a small part of the picture. even if only 1% of those DGUs saved only 1 life, guns would save more lives than they took.

3. they start by saying how some criminals didnt carry a gun because of stricter laws. well how many law abiding citizens didnt because it would be illegal, which made them unable to defend themselves. logic would dictate more *law abiding* citizens got screwed than *law breaking* criminals. so the net effect is negative. again, they are only looking at a small part of the big picture.

4. in his own cited article it says

&gt; Meanwhile, many more categories of people, including Nazi party members, were exempted from gun ownership regulations altogether

and this is the issue, he may have lowered the regulations as a whole, but the point was that he segregated it. he didnt deregulate guns like the poster is saying, he just selectively disarmed his opponents. you see the point behind gun freedom is *equality*. the lack of equality in Nazi Germany proves our point.

On top of that the second half uses the ""gun homicide"" argument again. Bah.

Basically you seem to have misinterpreted the reason for mentioning these sorts of concepts. Because it fouls statistical information. The author isn't making any sort of case based on this as much as they are pointing out that the data might not even be all that accurate because it's not really properly representative of certain scenarios. Such as single mothers, privately discussed/arranged custody. 
I am not wise enough to speculate too heavily on the ""problem"" but I do know that Children benefit from stability, and having 2 parents. I know that parents benefit from having a partner. And I know that there isn't a ""group"" of people with whatever label you want that is free of guilt in this issue in one way or another. I think people taking having kids seriously as a society is step 1. Society deciding to make fewer people, globally, is step 2. "
MidnightSlinks,AskAcademia,1390055968.0,"Graduate schools have no interest in giving out low grades. If they wanted to get rid of a poor student, they could just fail them on their research proposal or comprehensive exam (or be nice about it and discretely tell them to Master out).

It's also hard to offer *very tough* classes that you can fill. There are only so many students studying any individual topic so the academic courses have to be made a bit broader so that you can get students from a wider range into them. Wider range of topics = each topic is covered in a bit less detail = easier.

My Uni's biology department already taught each graduate level course once every 4 semesters to get as many students as possible who could use the course, but they would still only have 15-20 students. The extremely specific learning will be done via papers in your field given to you by your supervisor if you're a 1st or 2nd year student and after that you're expected to go find and learn anything necessary to further your work."

Kalivha,chemistry,1390056155.0,"I wrote my high school chemistry paper (which was long, if nothing else) in LaTeX; undergraduate lab reports ended up being in word because the proformas were .doc files (ugh, proformas), for my BSc project I've switched back to LaTeX and I prefer it but regulations specify that it has to be in Times New Roman and I've yet to figure out a way to make that happen; I've got a couple of approaches that might work (something with XeTeX, or converting to .odf) but haven't sat down to work on this issue yet.

My current project is about a 50/50 split of chemistry and maths, LaTeX is convenient for writing up the quantum background stuff for the chemistry part and *extremely convenient* for mathematical proofs (it has a theorem environment!). I use ChemDraw/gimp for chemistry-related images (ChemDraw doesn't do what I need half the time anymore) and I'm sort of planning to use gnuplot for the 3D plots if I ever get all my data together.

The lack of Times New Roman is the only downside of LaTeX I've found so far as I tend to hand everything in as PDFs no matter what I write it in. And ""lack of TNR"" isn't really much of a downside in the real world, I think.

For the sake of completeness, I think the reports for my last two independent research projects were written in LibreOffice and MS Office, respectively. They were sort of informal, though."

It's meant to stir a reaction in you.  It's ""art"", its entertainment, and its not an attack on men.  If you don't like how feminists react, and seem to look for things to get offended by, and ways to push their agenda on media and entertainment, then don't buy into that kind of thinking.

It also shows a lot of very bloody gory murder. slicing of throats. stabbing with big swords through the face....  and yet, I'm not moved to want to stab anybody with a sword either. Somehow, horror movies, video games, and the like have not caused me to want to harm another human being in any way. Quite amazing really....  Seeing a severed penis on a TV show is not an insult to men's rights, even if it shows a hypocrisy in what has been deemed okay by feminist influence in Hollywood.  "

injectilio,dataisbeautiful,1390057954.0,"I did a quick work up of variance from the trend line per team. The results were quite surprising! Everyone can tell YPG and PPG are positively correlated, but the extent to which this is true can help adjust your expectations based on starts in games this weekend.
 
Patriots (4.28) Vs. Broncos(1.11):  These two teams are quite near zero, so yards equally convert to points in this matchup. Look out for under performance in general.

49ers (-38.59) Vs. Seahawks (-28.55): These two teams will score more points than you would expect given their years connoting high efficiency. If the seahawks under perform in yards their likely hood of winning decreases greater than expected rather than the 49ers.

It is interesting how the AFC teams are closer to the trend line than the NFC teams. In the superbowl, if the AFC offence is projected to be poorly matched up against the NFC defense their likelihood of winning goes down. If the situation is reversed the NFC team's likelihood of winning doesn't decrease much due to higher efficiency.

Bottom 5: 
Rams	-30.398075
Cheifs	-36.4504375
Cowboys	-37
49ers	-38.5960875

rednail64,Christianity,1390058936.0,"&gt; why do you still have faith in a deity? 

Because of my personal experiences and my faith in centuries of church teaching and scholarship. 

&gt; Do you believe your faith came from choice or from where you are from? 

It was rooted in where I was born, but my faith has grown, matured and changed in many ways since I grew up, traveled, read, studied, etc.

&gt; How can you still be Christian knowing many things in life are considered sin? 

I don't get what one has to do with the other in this case 

&gt; Have you ever considered other religions a try why? Why not?  

Considered as in conversion?  No.  You just don't ""try out"" religions like a pair a shoes. I've certainly studied other religions, yet I stay a committed Christian.

After the second delay we asked why it was taking to long for replies to come back from Japan, were they very busy? The local support team said no, it's just that any questions had to be sent off for translation into Japanese, then sent to the developers, who replied and then the replies were translated back to English and sent back to us.

Having never played EE, I can't really vouch for Neera or Rasaad, but what I can tell you is this; Aerie is a great character to have by the end of the game.  She gets both mage and cleric spells and HLAs, so she's a powerhouse.  She also fulfills your wish for another cleric in the party.

Haer'Dalis isn't normally a disabler character, but what he is good at is tanking.  With the proper spells Haer'Dalis is almost impervous to harm.  Keldorn is also a great character to have, and the ultimate dispeller.  Mazzy is great in SoA, somewhat slows down in ToB though.

In the end it's really just personal choice.  You could make it through this game with 6 Tiax's if you really wanted to, just take who you want."

ajdeemo,DotA2,1390060785.0,"for what it's worth i did look through the replay, but i don't think it'd change much of what i said. their team didn't have good supports for contesting the push (tbh pugna support is kinda bad and you'd have a pretty large trilane advantage with the double stuns and plenty of nuke), and even if they did rotate, bristleback would be able to get plenty of cs in his lane. 

you'd essentially force them to either give a free tower or play trilane vs trilane. either choice is a winning scenario for you, since you have the stronger trilane, and they can't contest pulls well at all. 

however it is worth noting that lich will always get some exp, and you probably won't be able to force him out of lane completely, but he will bother you a lot less. you'll need to constantly deny and pull if necessary. since you're on dire, you can make use of both the normal small pull camp, and the western large pull camp. the latter is very useful after you take a tower, since you just need to cut a tree and you don't need to stack it. you will probably need to pull by yourself after you take a tower, since your supports will likely be somewhere else. but don't worry, it's very much worth it to last longer in lane, especially if you pull to the large camp."

Whether or not the pilots knew they were treated as separate systems by the aircraft I do not know. I can tell you that if any pilot  I know (and I've met some shitty pilots) gets a stall warning they know what to do.

The number one thing when flying IFR is TRUST YOUR INSTRUMENTS. The A330 is intuitive enough to only give you the information it knows is correct, so if the plane is telling you something like say, stall, it's the real deal."

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390061457.0,"I feel there is a fundamental difference between seeking money and seeking attention. 

Seeking money should be understandable from a purely capitalistic POV. (you can still look down on some type of strategies being employed in the pursuit of money, like knowlingly taking money from minors for example =&gt; but it should still be understood that seeking money and seeking attention are two fundamentally different motivations)

And I'm kinda of confused why ""genuine"" seeking attention would be considered worse/more dishonest than seeking views for money. 

I would argue that most streamers (male or female) do it because they dream of making money with something they think is easy or awesome. 

If anybody did it genuinely only for attention, I'm kinda confused. My gut instinct is to say that lot of people, particularly young people to dumb things to attract attention especially of the opposite sex. In the end it seems to me that they probably run a worse chance of getting hurt or looking back to this time a few years into the future only to cringe about how they used to be. I do agree that people that want attention (maybe because their rl sucks) can be exhausting and annoying, but isn't the choice just to not watch them? Being annoying, alas is not the same as being immoral. And in my experience, most people can't keep up being annoying forever. Just look at every pop culture/pop artist fad ever. It's much better to be zen about those things and look at those people with a thought of ""this too shall pass"". (of course as long as streaming exists there will always be new people who are annoying, but ""ths too shall pass"" goes for each one of them individually)

=&gt; question like this always make me wonder if it's really the problem that they seek attention (again, it's not something I would recommend to people, but I still have a hard time seeing how it is immoral) but that they get attention. But aren't then the people who give them attention at fault? Aka the people who presumably have low standards because they will keep watching somebody of poor skill even though you already told them that the player is just trolling them or never intends to date them? Aka if there were people who do all kinds of stupid and embarassing shit on stream with not a single person watching them, would you still care as much? But in that case, isn't the real problem not what they are doing, but that people actually watch them? "

I think that what you should take away from my previous comment is that disconnection from the aircraft is not good in emergencies where aircraft control is the difference between life or death. Something that /u/suntorytimo forgot to mention is that in a Boeing, you can almost *feel* what's right for the aircraft. Putting the connection into words is difficult, but it definitely feels like you're flying a plane. You can almost tell what to do from just the feel through the stick. It is hard to put a plane at cruising speed into a stall at full throttle, and that's reflected by how hard you would have to pull back the yoke in order to do it.

I know I sound like I'm pro-Boeing anti-Airbus. I'm not. Just in this specific instance my opinion is that Boeing does it better. There have been cases where a Boeing crashed and an Airbus likely wouldn't have."

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1390062004.0,"I can kind of understand your wife's perspective, actually.  When I'm REALLY into someone, romantically/sexually, I really don't want to use condoms.  I really don't enjoy sex with condoms that much, but I have no problem using them with casual sexual relationships.  But if I was in NRE/love with someone, I'd want to know that eventually we could be fluid bonded.  For me it's this kind of primal need.

That doesn't justify her breaking the boundary, AND lying about it, both of which are shitty and awful things to do.  I'm just saying that I understand her when she says, honestly to you, that she knows she will have a really difficult time sticking to this boundary.

Honestly, if she feels like she needs to break it off with the bf, there's probably a good reason for it. Maybe she's realizing that she's been neglecting you, not honoring her commitments to you, and feels powerless to stop as long as she's with BF.  Her saying she would rather break up with him could be showing that she sees your relationship as her as the primary, most important one.  That should be honored.

Or she could be maniuplatively trying to get you to agree to no condoms  by showing you how sad she'll be without the bf.  I don't know your wife. You're a better judge of whether this is a strategy she's using to get you to be ok with no condoms or not.  "

Lluxx,changemyview,1390062043.0,"These, correct me if I'm wrong, are your views:

1. Chromosomes determine gender; ""what chromosomes do you have? Well then, that's your gender.""

2. Societal consequences for things outside the norm are acceptable (relating to GID); you say you do not believe them to be acceptable, but the fact you sympathise with the fact that ""Someone, at some point, is going to notice that and be pretty ruffled about it."" and know that 'ruffled' can have very dark effects for the individual that you call a liar means you indicate it is acceptable and upon the individual to change. 

3. You believe transitioning does not change someone's gender, but in light of the above evidence that chromosomes do not always dictate gender you say that this is okay as long as they were ""fundamentally this way"". Gender dysphoria starts in childhood, so there is a very strong case that trans individuals are fundamentally this way. 

In light of this, here are my questions for you:

1. If chromosomes do not always determine gender, what goes determine gender? What, to you, makes a man or a woman?

2. You seem to have accepted that transitioning cures gender dysphoria, but believe individuals should not pursue this cure because of the reprecussions they may face. If transgender individuals are not hurting society, why do you defend society discrimminating against them?

3. My 'casual relationship', as you put it, between discrimmination and suicide rates is backed up by evidence from professionals and from trans individuals themselves. This makes it seem less like a casual relationship as they are reliable sources, but surely if I'm wrong and there is research that continued gender dysphoria is the reason for trans suicides, you would be able to find one study to support that?

I'm not going to debate with you about meditation because we are discussing a mental condition and its sociological repercussions, not the effects of meditation on illnesses. I'm very glad that you find such happiness from meditation, but because we are debating this you will have to provide hard evidence that meditation would work for the vast majority of people and is therefore better than modern medicine. As I am assuming you can only provide me with outlying cases like Buddhist monks - which are hardly applicable to the majority of people, let alone GID - so there seems little point it debating it because I will not change my stance unless you can provice firm, empirical evidence as I have attempted to do for you throughout this discussion. 

Also, I would remind you that I didn't 'make this your business' - you came onto this thread and directed a question at a post of mine which was aimed at someone else. That's fair enough, I don't criticise you for that, but you wanted to debate your views; nobody forced you. 

The reason why I believe you are simply uncomfortable with the idea of trans people is that you are very reluctant to change any aspect of your view even when it is refuted and you don't offer evidence to the contrary. 

Your argument keeps changing as to what, exactly, your problem is with trans people, hence why I am asking you questions to try and understand. "

The two co-pilots' task sharing was weakened both by *incomprehension of the situation at the time of autopilot disconnection*, and by poor management of the ""startle effect"", leaving them in an emotionally charged situation. The cockpit *lacked a clear display of the inconsistencies in airspeed readings identified by the flight computers leading to further disorientation and confusion*.""

ajdeemo,DotA2,1390062535.0,"i'm not saying it's a bad item. i'm saying that there are items which normally take priority over halberd. 
 
hood isn't a bad item either, but it doesn't really give you much offensively, and normally you're better off simply getting a black king bar which will nullify magic damage in fights for a long time, which is generally more useful. usually you'd only get it if you plan to make a pipe for the team, and even then, you still likely need a bkb

as for other items, normally a bb will get boots and then vanguard and treads. this is fine, as vanguard is a good item situationally. however, you might not always want vanguard. if the enemy team doesn't do a lot of autoattack damage, suitable replacements are drum and armlet. drum gives you both health and mana, and armlet does mostly the same thing as vanguard (hp regen, more tank via armor, more hp when activated) but adds damage as well. armlet is also a viable option if you need to be the primary carry and output a lot more damage.

after that, you generally want to pick up an ac and a bkb. bkb is for obvious reasons, and ac gives you plenty of armor to improve your mediocre agi gain.

anything further is situational. maybe you want an abyssal for lockdown, a halberd to help against a carry you can't 1v1, a heart to leverage your large amount of armor, etc."

It sounds like the company your using is providing a lot of the services agents would be concerned about then, so I guess the main difference from a traditional agent would be in their marketing.

It might help set the other agent's mind at ease.

Keep in mind that most of my real estate experience was in NC from 2006-2011 and some things may have changed by then, but I do know worries over closing an the legal/paperwork side of things were what put most agents off working with flat-fee companies.

Death turned, slowly, and locked eyes  with the man who dared to challenge him; with the man who could see him. ""Why ever would I not?"" The voice creaked and was hard to hear, but the words were laced with a finality that sent chills down the man's spine. 

""Because,"" he coughed. ""Because I am her doctor. It is my sworn duty to help her live."" The doctor shoved his way between Death, who rose his hands as to not touch the man, and the bed. Intubation tubing trailed from the woman's mouth and machines gave readings of her vital statistics. 

""Don't tell me that is your only reason, doctor,"" Death coaxed. 

""You know she's my wife.""

""Yes, and I know that she is comatose. She fell down the stairs last month. When you took her here, that's when you found the glioblastoma. Poor thing, unconscious and no one is able to keep her little head from popping,"" he taunted. Death reached slowly around the doctor, hand snaking up to the young woman's forehead. ""Let me ease her suffering.""

The man cried out in protest and slapped away Death's hand.

""Shall I take you both? It's not quite your time, but I can make an exception."" The doctor shook at the proposition. He loved his wife and couldn't see another day without her to be a day worth living. Still, he was hesitant to accept the offer.

""I promise,"" Death crooned, ""you won't be separate. Just let me ease her - and your - pain."" He stepped in and laid his hands, which carried the cold of the grave, on the young couple's foreheads. The doctor held his wife's limp hand, and closed his eyes.

ballookey,exjw,1390063621.0,"&gt; They teach us that the outside world is poison. College, or 'secular education' as they call it, is discouraged. Psychology, repressed, philosophy, quelled even harder.

I was thinking back recently on how I really did genuinely believe in god when I was a JW and that I prayed to him, regardless of evidence that he didn't exist, because I believed.

And I realized, the reason they quash all those other ""worldly"" pursuits, is because if most JW's were to educate themselves, work on and achieve success in non-JW projects, grow in confidence…then they would realize they get feelings of fulfillment, joy, triumph, inner peace, etc… all by themselves without the hand-holding of the Governing Body or the specter of god.

The Governing Body has worked hard to orchestrate day-to-day JW life such that the only way one feels such things is through *their* activities, and by *no other means*. In fact, they work hard to make people feel guilt when straying outside the lines.

You can do it. You can leave and enrich yourself without guilt."

Willravel,AskScienceFiction,1390063790.0,"I think the idea is that the major players, heaven and hell, set up rules by which they're able to claim souls in order to harvest them for power. 

It's probably a combination of whatever rules there are for high level magic, the principles of each side, and the already existing imbalance of power between them. We've seen that magic follows certain rules, though I wouldn't quite know how to put together a science of magic, so there are probably aspects of where a soul goes which are based on the laws of magic. Perhaps something about purity like not taking the life of another. Another aspect has to do with which side, heaven or hell, humans seem to be more like in life. We've seen that demons like exploiting, causing harm, gaining power, and the like, so it stands to reason that hell would want to claim the souls of those kinds of people. Pious, hollier-than-thou, single-minded believers, on the other hand, are far more like the angels which have been left in charge of heaven, so they would probably be claimed by the angels. Finally, there's a significant power imbalance between heaven and hell, as even low level angels could take on high level demons in combat with little effort (unless they're being sabotaged, like when Cas had his power reduced during his fight with Alastair by the forces in charge in heaven), so it's likely that heaven has a tendency to take more souls which are on the line because they can assert more pressure on reapers. 

The reapers are probably where the answer to this really ultimately lies. Their job, under the leadership of Death, is to escort souls where they need to go, so there is probably a series of agreements between the reapers and various supernatural organizations which require souls. The reapers probably take a percentage off the top, and then follow agreements made with factions like heaven or hell or valhalla or the summerland or even reincarnation. "

The ethical question of the episode was downright scary. The NX-01 is on a mission to save an entire planet, and Archer has taken on a great deal of additional responsibility, and is now more prepared to make extreme ethical decisions because of what's at stake. For Archer, at least for season 3, his motto might as well be ""The ends justify the means."" Nowhere is that more true than in the creation of sentient life for the purpose of murdering it for organ harvesting. Yes, Archer did some terrible things, like nearly air-locking a prisoner and resorting to stealing parts from an innocent crew, but Sim was probably the most cruel thing he did. "

ballookey,exjw,1390065048.0,"&gt; Why do we get old and die? Why (not how) are we here?

There's a crazy tree-like weed that grows outside my office window. If it wonders why it's there, I could explain that at some point, seeds of that weed were deposited on that soil, perhaps by one of the crows or parrots that fly through the area. And the weed would say, ""most of my kind are destroyed immediately - there's so much concrete - this universe is full of hostile concrete and yet I live"". 

And I'd explain that it was the lucky one, happening to land on a tiny strip of soil between two hostile zones (our rooftops), in between the property of a renter who doesn't care and the property of a 90 year old woman who couldn't cut it down. 

And now here's able-bodied me, inheritor of the weed, who wishes there wasn't a *weed* growing 16 feet into the air on that spot, but who also enjoys the shade in the summer and who is spectacularly lazy when it comes to the topic of wielding a chainsaw in close quarters to remove it from the chain link fence it's grown through. 

The weed is there, because of a lot of *reasons*, but there's no existential mystery to it. It could just as easily NOT be there.

We are here because of a chain of events, and if things had happened differently, we might not be here to ask that question. 

That chain of events isn't mystical or supernatural, but it doesn't mean that they don't have some interesting consequences. As Carl Sagan said:

&gt; We are the local embodiment of a Cosmos grown to selfawareness.

The topics (around the center) are automatically generated.

&gt;Word clouds can also used to represent distinguishing topics. In this case, the size of the word within the topic represents its prevalence among the cluster of words making up the topic. We use the 6 most distinguishing topics and place them on the perimeter of the word clouds for words and phrases.

&gt;Many strong results emerging from our analysis align with our LIWC results and past studies of gender. For example, females used more emotion words [86], [87] (e.g., ‘excited’), and first-person singulars [88], and they mention more psychological and social processes [34] (e.g., ‘love you’ and ‘3’ –a heart). Males used more swear words, object references (e.g., ‘xbox’ and swear words)

eighthgear,anime,1390067344.0,"I have to say, the whole sequence with the gangsters and the yakuza was funny in the manga, but absolutely brilliant in this episode. Shaft has done a great job so far, in my opinion.

EDIT: Now that I've finished the episode, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought that Shaft would be a good fit for Nisekoi, since Shaft has excelled in the past at fast-paced comedies (namely, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and Arakawa Under the Bridge), though most people nowadays think of Monogatari and Madoka when they think of the studio. The pacing of the episode was great - the two main ""scenes"" - the confrontation with the yakuza and gangsters, and the date, were both given enough time to prosper, but not too much time, which could cause them to drag on. The manga is full of reaction faces and all sorts of cutaways, and Shaft did a great job incorporating those into the show as well. I can see the ""cut to manga-style frames"" thing getting old, but so far, it has been quite well-done, in my opinion.

Visually speaking, this episode definitely has the Shaft flair, without going overboard on it. It was the perfect mix of the other-wordly atmosphere that Shaft likes to impart on its series, and the more conventional romcom setting of the manga. The background music was great, as usual, and I really enjoyed the ED, which reminded me a lot of  Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei's OPs and the Madoka Magica witch barrier scenes.

On a more random note, I like how they adapted the yonkoma into the post-ED sequences.

The fact that like it or not, we're stuck here together and need to work together to ensure a good future for our children. You don't do that by saying, ""White kids out, black kids stay here!""

That said, slander is a narrowly defined crime under common law which predates the Constitution, the definition of which has been narrowed even further in the US.

""Threatening the President"" (under 18 USC 871), or public officials (under 18 USC 876), being illegal are only Constitutionally justified under a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause - which is abused again for this purpose.

""Fighting Words"" being illegal is based on (an incorrect IMO) 1942 Supreme Court decision.  Funny how many of the screwed up interpretations of the Constitution from the Supreme Court start in the 20th century.

The science isn't always perfect so people will take a shot, wait and take another shot. Also, a person hit by a tranq may quickly pull it out and be unaffected by the chemicals.

RoA is somewhat good on invoker but you don't have enough inventory slots to carry all the items you listed (lest you sold your drums). I tend to build Atos against very specific heroes like Ursa or Sven who are vulnerable to kiting.

also, don't bother taking invoke at level 2 if you skill exort first. getting 4 quas before maxing out exort is great since double spirits is so powerful. and i dont' think level 2 invoke is worth getting until level 11

bracer and drums are fine

rod of atos isn't great, euls is generally better (and enough) since it can setup your meteor/sunstrike/blast combo which is ridiculously strong in the midgame. also getting more items delays your aghs, which you want as soon as you hit 17. usually it's best to only get one mid game item such as force staff or euls before aghs

Carlyle has him on the PK and in the top four where he's not comfortable. I'd like to see him and Gardiner switched so he can go back to playing where he had the most success.

Basilgate,WritingPrompts,1390070478.0,"Julia woke, wincing in the harsh light, to see the doctor inspecting his instruments. He hummed a jolly tune to himself while laying the glittering tools out in front of him. She was lying upright on an operating table, her whole body at a forty-five degree angle. Her head felt thick with wool, from whatever he’d injected her with, and his voice sounded as if coming from another room.

“Had a nice nap did we?” he said, studying a sharp scalpel.

As her dizziness faded, the realisation of what was happening came to her with slow, horrible pulses of clarity. The light from all around her pressed in, oppressive and unyielding. In spite of it, she could just make out the room she was in; an operating theatre, white, clean, smelling the same as a combination of any ordinary hospital or dental surgery she’d ever been in. Opposite her was a large, metal door, that looked like the sort used in the hidden bank vaults she’d seen in films.

“I must say you led me on quite a merry chase,” he said, letting out a sharp, loud breath that ruffled his blue surgical mask. “Yes. Quite a merry. Chase.”

He whistled to himself now, waltzing over to the sink and washing his hands, ignoring her struggles to break free from the thick, white leather bonds that bound her. Julia tried to piece together the preceding scenes. She had been walking in the woods, as her father had instructed her not to. She could see his wrinkled, reproachful face that had made her want to do it even more. She’d cut her knee when she spotted the house amidst the bracken, and now felt it throb. *So strange for a house to be out here*, she’d thought, and such a strange house too, all big, boxy and white. It made her think of a cartoon, though she wasn’t sure which. It had looked abandoned and she’d ignored the warning voice in her head because it spoke like her father. Always sensible. Always safe. Always dull. She’d peeked in a window and saw red paint, splattered crazily on the walls and the floor of the white living room. *Someone must’ve danced around with a whole can of it*. That was what she thought at first. Until she saw the body propped up against a sofa, the skin torn to ribbons. Even then her brain worked to explain around it. *A film prop, like a dummy*. But it was too real. Much too real. As she turned to run, finally heeding her father’s increasingly panicked voice, the front door slammed open, and a tall, rake thin man in blood-spattered doctor’s attire burst out, chasing after her at once.

“Get back here you bitch,” he’d called in a high, petulant voice. “Fucking useless little shit,”

She ran. And ran and ran. Dodging trees and bounding over rocks, until her chest felt set to explode. And still he came, yelling and cursing, getting closer and closer. She didn’t know what tripped her, but he was on her in an instant. She’d kicked and thrashed but he was so strong, and then there was a stinging in her neck. As her world turned to black, she thought, *the Powerpuff Girls’ house.*

And now, he stood over her again, his clothes pristine. His eyes were filled with nothing remotely close to sanity, and she could do nothing but scream.

“No point in that,” he said, in the tones of a friendly school teacher. “Even if these walls weren’t soundproof, there isn’t anybody about for miles. Well... apart from nosy, shitty little girls. And what’re the chances of there being another one of those. Actually, quite likely, if you ask me.”

He laughed in a manner that suggested it wasn’t something he did often.

“Please,” Julia said, her throat, for some reason, dry and cracked. “I don’t...”

He was right up against her face before she could finish, holding a scalpel to her left eye. She smelled his hot, sterile breath as he yelled at her in his shrill, childish voice.

“Don’t you *fucking* whine like that, you baby. Don’t you ever *fucking* do that again. You hear me, you fucking stupid little whore. *Pleeeeease, oooo pleeeeeeeease*.”

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, just...” she almost said it again, “don’t hurt me, don’t pl-”

She felt the blade push up against her lower eyelid. Felt the tiny marble of blood that welled up against it, and stopped speaking, holding her trembling lips closed as best she could. The doctor sighed and stepped away.

“Don’t take this personally,” he said, calm now as he wheeled his tray of tools over to her, “But it’s just a matter of bad luck, really. For you, I mean. For me this is somewhat of a privilege. This is my passion, you see. My art. And the only way to truly master your art is...” he picked up what looked like a silver corkscrew, brandishing it like a paintbrush, “Practice.”

Julia stared with wide, panicked eyes at the other instruments, hating her mind for the assumptions it made as to their usage. The doctor leaned towards her. She got the hideous sense that he had licked his lips behind his mask. She bucked and writhed as best she could, but the straps may as well’ve been wrought of iron. She screamed through her hoarse throat.

“Yes.” he cooed, “Scream. There’ll be plenty more of that to come.”

And then, a mighty crash as one of the walls erupted in a shower of dust and concrete, accompanied by a roar like the blaring of a titanic hell-train. Julia coughed and spluttered, and the doctor stumbled, shielding his eyes. The ground shook with the steady rhythm of an ancient god’s drums and, striding forth from the rubble, emerging from the haze with awesome, primal splendour, came the tyrannosaurus.

“Curses!” the doctor yelled. “My secret genetic-engineering project that I keep in my basement. Oh, why didn’t I use a stronger lock?”

The great beast regarded him with one cold yellow eye as he ran to the door, hopping cartoonishly on his feet, fiddling in vain with the lock, tittering nonsense to himself. Yawning it’s tremendous maw, the t-rex brought it’s teeth down upon the doctor and lifted him, wailing and flailing, into the air. Julia heard his bones crunch as it shook him around, like a dog with a toy, and then he was gone. The rex stamped his great, scaly foot, and roared again sending tremors throughout the room, and causing the table Julia was strapped on to come crashing down, and the bonds holding her to come loose. Her ears were ringing, and her body ached terribly from the fall, but she was alive. She rose awkwardly to her feet, dusted herself off, and stood face to face with the king of the dinosaurs. Well, more like face to knee. It looked down at her, moving it’s jaw in a thoughtful way. Julia thought she saw approval in those amber eyes. With a low growl, the tyrannosaurus lowered it’s head, just enough so Julia could climb up it, and over the horny scales of his brow. 

And so, with her legs dangling either side of his mighty neck, the t-rex crashed through the house and out into the forest, and together, they rode off into the sunset."

Arcturus_,AskMen,1390070522.0,"It's not insecurity, as much as it's uncertainty. You girls **love** to be friends after breakups, you're infamous for it. You're also naive in thinking that the guy doesn't have some secret agenda for getting back with you. That is why as guys, we nope the fuck out when we hear you're friends with your ex, because we damn well know more than you do about the situation. 

Let me give you an example. I broke up with this girl a year ago, we were together for about 8 months. She had always been in relationships where she was abused verbally and mistreated, especially with this one guy she dated for 5 years. In the beginning of our relationship one night she told me a friend was coming over, I thought nothing of it, she made it sound like it was a girl friend. She never disclosed to me at the time this friend was her ex of 5 years. It took her about 6 months to tell me. She told me they never did anything but once you lie about something like your ex coming over how am I going to trust you didn't do anything? In fact she told me he tried to get with her again.

So our relationship had naturally progressed without me knowing anything about her ex staying the night, I tried to be good to her and undo the damage of her previous ex's. She was damaged goods but I was willing to do my best to make her happy because I felt she was worth it. Towards about the 6 months mark we fought, all the time. What did we mainly fight over? Ex's. She didn't have boundaries with these guys because they didn't give a shit about her. She'd flirt with guys all the time and I couldn't stand it. She'd use this guy as a crutch every time I said I didn't like something that she was doing. She clearly had stockholm syndrome, this guy had such a grip on her. As her and I drifted apart from all our fighting she started secretly meeting with him again. ""Hanging out"" and meeting in mall parking lots. That's when I broke it off and said I'd save her the trouble of having to sneak around on me. We haven't talked since. 

So when we hear about you being friends with someone you were once romantic with, of course we don't fucking like it. Some more than others. It hardly means we're insecure it's more that we know the potential it brings to fuck us in the ass. If I hear any ounce of information that a girl is 'best friends' with her ex I end it because more times than not I'm going to end up hurt. "

duggtodeath,atheism,1390070635.0,"&gt; For example: many people accept the theory of evolution to be the truest theory of how we came to be.

You are missing one giant step. People performed experiments and collected data and dug up physical evidence before they solidified evolution. Its not like someone just made it up. There was hard work that went into it. It's not just generally ""accepted"" when work went into it. Don't forget that step because it is important!

&gt; That being said, it is still a theory; not a fact.

This shows me you do not understand what a scientific theory mean. You are using the other connotation of the word theory to support your argument. Stop doing that. Scientific theories are not guesses or hunches. We have evidence to back up the claims and that makes it a fact.

&gt; While it is all but proven, and the amount of evidence pointing towards it is overwhelming; it hasn't been proven entirely and therefore requires some amount of faith to believe that it is indeed 100% accurate.

That's very poor reasoning. Your argument is because we cannot be 100% conclusive with the evidence, then NONE of the evidence should be respected and we need to throw it all out. That makes no sense. We have a very good foundation and all the experiments prove evolution as truth. ""Faith"" by contrast is the belief in something WITHOUT evidence, one of it's defined connotations. We would have faith in evolution only if we did not perform any experiments to test that faith. If we actually test religious faith we can find invariably that its claims are always false. In fact, faith has turned this flaw into a strength, by using the absence of believing in something without evidence as an indicator of strong character--a virtue.

&gt; The problem with faith lies when your belief system begins to use faith as a justification where facts to the contrary are present.

I think you are missing the core problem. Either something is a fact or it is not. It may be misunderstood, but you cannot dice up knowledge into what we know and then include what others ""feel."" The world works on evidence and fact. We should not make room for faith because everyone has differing faiths. And no two people will agree on the details of that faith even if they ascribe to the same religion. You cant argue with facts, which is why we use them as gold standard for discussion and decisions. Science doesn't apply faith in evolution. Science tested it, and the evidence supports it.

&gt; Faith in something isn't bad

The problem here is assuming that faith by itself is a virtue. The men who committed 9/11 had perfect faith. They were devout men of their god, and acted as they felt, according to their faith, in his honor. That is an example of what faith accomplishes. Facts should triumph over faith and replace it, but what we observe is that the facts are rejected in order for the delusion to remain. Faith is bad because literally anyone can manufacture poor ideas and have them treated as valid."

Sort of.  We have names of some of the people involved, who we know are Al Qaeda, and many of the others are part of organizations affiliated with Al Qaeda.  In the latter case, that is more than enough to allow the NSA to wiretap Americans removed from them by three degrees of separation (supposedly since the President's speech, now only two degrees) or put them on the President's assassination list (supposedly justified in part by the AUMF)... but somehow not enough to use the military.

The problem for the military is they're being told by some politicians that the people involved are **not** Al Qaeda.  ...and there's only one politician who can make that call.

&gt; And you're telling me they should ignore the investigation and listen to the politicians. How is that not ""playing politics?""

No, I'm saying the military is saying what they've been told to say by they White House about why the White House will not let them go after the terrorists.

Oh, hi!

So, first of all, gender roles? Total fucking bullshit. Mostly construct. I mean, maybe there's some truth to them, but I don't think so. 

Second of all: The experience of being trans is hard to explain, but I'll do my best.

For me, when I say that I'm a girl, I merely mean that I am more comfortable in a ""female"" body, and that, from what we understand about minds, people like me have brains that look more like those of women than men, which is to say that the part of a person that defines who they are is female, a well. Making me, well, a girl.

I also know that, socially, I like being treated more like a woman than like a man... well, in most ways. I wish I could dodge out on the sexism, but no such luck XD. I suspect this has more to do with 1) being treated like other people like me and 2) The fact that people who treat me like a girl tend to also be the people who are supportive of me than anything else... but there might be something more complicated. Dunno. 

I don't know if this is a particularly good explanation; I'm REALLY sick right now (like, I was unable to stand up this morning levels of ""really sick""... whee really bad colds!), as well as this being a reasonably hard idea to explain."

While almost all companies have some sort of training function, the continuum is really wide, from teams of dozens to a team of one.

It would really benefit you to get a little more focus on what kind of role you'd like to fill.  An easy way to divide the roles on a team might be front of house and back of house.

Front of house training folk tend to be the ones who deliver the training and also often serve as internal consultants to their clients, conducting needs assessments, evaluations, etc.  You definitely want to look into the ADDIE model, which is the training development model most training departments use.  Qualifications for these roles might include subject matter expertise and strong facilitation and presentation skills, as well as consulting skills and problem solving.  

Back of the house is where you'd find the designers, or Instructional Designers as they are known.   These are the experts in adult learning theory, but also typically have some tech skills in working with design (Articulate, Captivate, Lectora) and possibly managing the Learning Management System as well.

I'm happy to answer any questions you have, but I'd strongly recommend you find your local chapter of ASTD (www.astd.org) and see if you can attend a meeting or social hour as a guest and learn more.

Of course, you should also jump on LinkedIn as there are a ton of learning groups, and then see if you can connect with some people in your network for some Informational Interviews.

The reason we learn, keep track of and enforce grammar, syntax, usage and so on is to try to prevent the language from naturally deviating.  Novel morphemes and syntactical variations and colloquial usage seep in and next thing you know, a dialect forms, then a distinct language emerges.

Arcturus_,AskMen,1390071238.0,"Of course it is. I've always said FWB is like a doorway to an exclusive relationship. It's very difficult to sleep with someone and not develop some sort of intimate feelings at some point. It's almost inevitable that one of the two people will. 

While it's possible, it can also be unlikely. Of course like any situation there are variables that come into play. Sometimes one of the partners is simply looking for sex, emotionless purely physical raw sex, and will make sure they stay cold otherwise. Friendly, but distant. 

If you're looking to get into a relationship FWB, as I said, is usually the doorway to achieving that."

&gt; Are you saying that the military is lying?

I am saying that the military is repeating the lies they've been told to, by the only person who can order them to.  Predictably, the lies are transparent, but the people telling them have no choice.

&gt; &gt; I would rather they stop playing politics with the entire situation

&gt; They?

Yes - the Obama administration - the only people who can make the call that members of Al Qaeda are not actually members of Al Qaeda as far as the military is concerned.

&gt; Does ""whole thing"" mean Romney's criticism while the attack was still going on?

Romney, as the Republican Nominee, was privy to the same intelligence briefings on the situation that the President was.  In short, he knew that the attacks on the post in Benghazi had nothing to do with the video and everything to do with terrorism, as soon as the President did - which meant he knew the administration was lying when they blamed it on the video.

His statement: 

&gt; I'm outraged by the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt and by the death of an American consulate worker in Benghazi. It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.

...now that we have much of the same information, appears to be correct."

duggtodeath,atheism,1390071484.0,"Your original comment was that:

&gt; Churches like this, who seem to revel in irrationality, just give Christians a bad name.

I disagree with that statement. As much as people like to cherrypick the touchy-feely, loving parts of the Bible, they also skip over the psychopathic parts where their deity murders innocent people for daring  to question his existence, asks that parents murder their disobedient children, and ascribes contradictory rules for living one's life. Yes, I've heard the arguments about context, so when I read the book I made sure to understand what situations the passages were involved in. And, no, Jesus did not come later to undo the old testament madness.

&gt; This error, fideism, has been condemned throughout the history of the church.

I find a big problem with faith asking people to use reason. Applying reason to faith destroys it every time. This is just asking churchs to remain faithful, while distancing themselves from the crazy parts of the bible. It is a religion shrinking, stripping off parts to present a leaner set while still remaining faithful to an illogical, unreasonable core. Essentially, its splitting hairs. Its like asking a bank robber to continue being robbing banks, but conduct his robberies properly otherwise he risks making all bank robbers look bad.

&gt; The biblical concept of faith is more akin to trust, trust in the promises of God.

This is meaningless preaching and is playing with semantics to sound good to believers while being hollow. Its like a security blanket used to convince oneself that their faith is still intact."

Sharkictus,TrueChristian,1390071515.0,"I think the best way this could be dealt with is making the entire Catholic Church an actual member of Vatican City state.

Make all priests have dual citizenship, and Bishops renounce their national citizenship. 

That way they have authority to punish some priests. If they molest a child, they are defrocked, and unless they renounce their Vatican citizenship, and go to a country that won't send them back into the church's hands, they will be capture and but into a special prison owned by the Vatican. Perhaps an island, and the guards are priests as well.

The prison is semi-monastery esque. All of these offenders can do is sit in a room, and read theology. 

If they truly repentant, after a few years they can socialize with few other repentant, instead of just guards. 

But otherwise they are there forever, even if they are determined to be repentant and forgiven. They get the cut off hand, gouge your eye out solution, cut off from society because they might do a terrible sin. "

If the nails are long they are in the way and are a useless and expensive waste of cash. If a females natural nails are chewed, I just can't help but wonder why doesn't she stop chewing them. I was once an obsessive bleeding nail biter and stopped, so it might be a sign of a lack of willpower. If the nails are chipped and dirty  it might be a sign of not caring about her hygiene or a diet issue which then leads me to think why not just add a supplement or start caring for the nails.

keypuncher,conservatives,1390073159.0,"Here's the thing: Snowden exposed the NSA doing unethical, illegal, and Unconstitutional things that severely compromised the rights and freedoms of Americans.

Did the revelation of those things harm the US?  Absolutely.

Would the things the NSA was doing have remained secret forever?  Of course not - they would eventually have come to light in one way or another.  So, it wasn't Snowden that harmed the US.  He just picked the timing.  The people who did the unethical, illegal, and Unconstitutional things, and those who authorized and enabled them to do so - those are the people who harmed the US.

Consider:

If a law is being proposed that would limit our Constitutional rights and freedoms, would you prefer to be unaware that our Congressmen have been spied on to the point that many are compromised and can be influenced with that information?  ...or would you prefer to know, and be able to take steps to stop it?

If a court case on a law that would limit our rights and freedoms is being decided, would you prefer to know that the Justices have been spied on to the point that they may be compromised, or remain ignorant of it and confused when they rule in a way that obviously contravenes the letter and intent of the Constitution?

If the US were on the verge of becoming the sort of totalitarian government that the Founders wrote the 2nd Amendment to forestall... would you prefer to know that the NSA is spying on everything you do, or remain ignorant of it, as you prepare to exercise your 2nd Amendment right to prevent the government from becoming that tyranny?

Personally, I'd prefer to know - it would have been better if we had known 10 or 20 years ago when there was opportunity to stop it instead of trying to fix it after the fact - but you can't fix what you don't know about."

UlgraTheTerrible,offmychest,1390073676.0,"&gt;  and people who attend salons know that those individuals live off tips

This is the point that I have specifically refuted in my post. 

No, fact is, I've never heard that beauticians live off tips. So when you say people know, do you have some statistics to back that up, or are you just assuming people know because you know? 

Frankly, *especially* in an industry that is so often run *independently* rather than through a salon, the assumption that a beautician sets their own prices is generally pretty fair, as is the assumption that people are getting paid a living wage from services that are pricey. 

Quite frankly, if I'm paying between $50 to $100 for a service that takes about an hour (maybe less) and *requires specialized education of some form to do professionally,* I rather expect that you're getting paid fairly decently for your time, certainly well above minimum wage. This is just the assumption of an average person, and I think it is absolutely fair to assume that anyone calling themselves a ""professional"" is *actually* professional, that is to say, above the need for tipping. 

And frankly, your broken system isn't going to change at all unless people in it stand together and say they aren't going to do it anymore.

Personally, I'm not much one for the waxing bullshit. I'd never waste my money like that, nor be comfortable exposing myself to a stranger, so calling me too lazy to wax my lady bits is pretty fucking rich, by the way, and also showcases some extreme ignorance about waxing in general. Frankly, it's better to have it done by a professional if you don't know what you're doing, and it's hardly a matter of laziness in the slightest. 

Frankly, I'm shocked by OP's unprofessional attitude, what with the refusal to make sure her customers waxing is hygienic by *insisting* they clean or having a shower available to do so. "

Really the only bad part about getting wisdom teeth out (apart from the recovery) is the anticipation of it. I got myself scared half to death about anesthesia before I even got started. I was more terrified about the needle to be honest. When they bring you into the room they lay you down and just talk to you. They talk amongst themselves (deliberately) to distract you and then before you know it, you're awake again in the recovery room (where they put everyone following surgery). Really painless, it's akin to falling asleep. Do you remember when you fell asleep last night? Probably not right? Same with anesthesia. Don't worry about the nausea either, they give you anti-nausea medication to prevent that.

 The recovery room is actually the best part, you feel very in the zone, very relaxed. They take great care of you in there, they give you juice and you just feel very relaxed. I love the recovery room. Shortly after you wake up though they wheel you down and then you're free to go home.

This mechanic simply forces them down the path of playing the colony game. In fact, you could see many of the changes in 1.4 as ""Encouraging"" players to pick up CP. 

The big issue is how do you ensure a player can play an aggressive central European power, a trade nation, a colonizer, an OPM, a Republic?

I've long been of the persuasion that anyone cultivating illicit or deviant sexuality (~everyone on the internet) owes it to themselves and their future partner(s?) to seek medical and personal help.  That way, any relationship they have will be with the other person in earnest and not with some pathology.


I've also long been of the persuasion that *many* psychological conditions and even some neurological ones are merely the medicalization of misery from an unconstructive life built around mistaken identities (which, may I add, usually originate from an external source through no fault of the subject's own.)

Pogglewoggle,relationships,1390074631.0,"Better sooner than later. There's never a ""good time"" for a breakup. If she's in love, it'll hurt no matter when but it's part of life. 

From what you're writing it seems that you have emotionally detached already and I think she might notice that and is therefore even more clingy. Sometimes people in unstable situations (i.e. her issues with family, thesis stress) desperately cling to the only thing they believe keeps them afloat (.i.e. you) and when that thing becomes unstable, too, they hold on even more desperate because they think they will fall if their last support is gone.

Anyways, the cruelest thing you can do is to lead her on and waste her time even longer. 

Be honest and tell her exactly why you are breaking up with her. Don't omit anything to avoid hurting her, she'll just beat herself up and obsess with the ""why"".  She needs to know what caused you to fall out of love. 
Make it absolutely clear that these reasons are only your perspective and your opinion, so avoid generalizing. She probably won't get it at first but eventually she'll be able grow from this by either realizing you were full of shit or that you had a point. "

The speedometer issue sounds electrical. Or a speed sensor. It's such a strange abnormal problem, you need to take it somewhere and let someone do diagnostics.

I did however have to throw away about a box of them because they were crimped. I also had to switch out a number of them because, like you said, they weren't cut uniformly. Overally it's probably the same as another brand's pack of 1000 because other sleeves break more easily. Personally I prefer the way they feel in my hands and the way they look.

This is really important, and it's great that your son and daughter are close.  I was close with my brother, and it really is wonderful growing up with someone of the opposite sex to make you realize how insignificantly different we are.  I'm positive it has also helped us both in interacting with the opposite sex, it was so normal that I hardly even noticed the difference most of the time.

theHBIC,Teachers,1390075980.0,"I started typing a response, but then I realized that I have no reason or need to justify my math abilities to you, so I'm going to start over with a different sentiment.

I agree that no one should teach something that they don't know. It's not my intention to. I'm reviewing these concepts simply because, while I was good at math, I always intended to be an English teacher, so I didn't have to take math past College Algebra when I got past high school. I think it's fair to say that, while I don't find quadratic factoring and graphing hard, I may need a few review problems after not using that skill in 8 years.

My question was posed for two reasons:
1 The structure and expectations for the essay/long form questions seem to be very different than the PLT and English PRAXIS tests, so I was hoping a real person could clarify some questions I have about those
2. I wanted a more wholistic picture of the content I need to quickly review and brush up on before I take the test.

Tazato,KillLaKill,1390076538.0,"To REALLY understand this clip, it helps to know a little background. So lets start with some history. 

China is the big power house at the time, its professional teams are already well established and its individual talent is some of the best that has ever been. Players like Ferrari, Chuan, Zhou, Burning, Xaio8 among others are legends in their own right, and they are all going to be in Seattle for The International 2012. 

Na'Vi are an all-star team as well, but not for their success in Warcraft 3 DotA. They are the reigning champions from The International 2011, the first Dota 2 championships. So going into the tournament there is already a strong sense of East versus West. Everyone expects China to dominate. 

Fast forward to the preliminary rounds. There are 16 teams in attendance, and they are split up into two round robin groups in order to determine seeding into the final bracket. Each group of 8 will have all the teams play each other twice, spread out over three days. Finish in the top 4 and you advance to the winners bracket, finish in the bottom four and you get into the losers bracket, where it's best of one single elimination for the first couple rounds. Oh, and only the top 8 teams get paid. 

Na'Vi lose a huge portion of their games on day one, and it looks like they aren't going to make Top four of their preliminary group. Every other team from the west is struggling as well, and the rumors of absolute Chinese dominance are confirmed. 

Na'Vi manages to win out their next two days of play, barely getting into the winner's bracket. 

iG, the other team in this clip (thought I forgot about that didn't ya?) go nearly undefeated, finishing with only one loss for the entire prelims. 

Now it's the winner's bracket semi-finals. Na'Vi manage to beat DK, another Chinese power house, to get to this point. However, now they have to face off against iG, the team expected to win the whole thing. 

Game one is a disaster. Na'Vi get rolled and tap out insanely early. Western hopefuls around the world despair. How will Na'Vi come back from such a devastating loss? 

By letting iG have the best combo in the game for free, of course.

The next draft, Na'Vi lets a combo that no other team has for almost the entire tournament. Naga Siren has an ultimate ability that makes everyone on the enemy team in a very large AOE disabled, invulnerable and un-targetable for seven seconds. Coupled with Dark Seer, whose vacuum ability sucks units in a large AOE towards a central point (and, at the time, still effects invulnerable units). it's an almost unbeatable combo. And Na'Vi just let the best team in the world have it. 

But it's all going according to plan. 

They pick a hero that has an ability to go magic-immune at will. They pick a hero that steals spells of his enemy. They pick a hero that has arguably the most powerful disable in the game and have him farm a quick item that grants magic immunity. 

Then *The Play* happens. Na'Vi is all grouped up and Zhou (on Naga Siren) catches them all with their pants down. Dark Seer drops all his abilities. It's disaster. There is no way they can win this fight. 

But Na'Vi knows what do to, and they do it flawlessly. 

Dendi, playing Rubick, a character that can steal the last spell that was used by an enemy, gets out of the initial barrage of abilities with his trusty Forcstaff. He then comes back in and Steals Tidehunter's ultimate and uses it against iG. LightOfHeaven activates his magic immunity item as soon as  Naga's song is turned off, and then manages to catch the Tidehunter in it ***literally*** [frames before](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mahHF8dIeVg#t=1m48s) he was able to use another skill. All the while, Juggernaught is spinning and dealing massive damage. 

It's a team wipe, but in the absolute opposite direction. Na'vi, in less then ten seconds, turned around an entire tournament. 

The crowd goes wild.  

Dota is saved. "
OlderThanGif,linux,1390076549.0,"I've always wanted to build an operating system around [proof-carrying code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-carrying_code). Certain services would be required to carry proofs with them that they won't end up in an infinite loop or won't dereference a bad pointer, for instance.

Microsoft Research was doing really cool things in this broad arena of dependable code with their [Singularity](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/singularity/) project. One of the cool things from Singularity was the idea of having certain OS components prove that they're going to staywithin their own address space. That means you can run them safely in the same address space, which means you avoid context switches, which is a *huge* performance win.

I took a start on it a couple times but each time got overwhelmed. I'll chip away at it some day. Programming languages and compiler tools are still really immature in this respect (still mostly only toy examples happening in academic research papers) so there's a lot of work to do with proof-carrying code and dependable software."

At first it was just a little cocaine during parties for the high, but by the end of the year it was an addiction.

He stole from you, lied to you and wrecked your property during a particularly bad meth binge. You had to cancel your lease halfway through junior year and distance yourself from him.

In the years since then you have seen him hurt everyone around him who truly cared about him, cheat on his longsuffering girlfriend, go through 3 rehab programs, at least 6 interventions and countless ""I've seen the light moments"" where he only needs a small loan(""I'm good for it, I swear) to turn his life around. He's never paid back once and although you don't keep count, you're pretty sure he's gotten $15,000 from you in the past 10 years.

Now, imagine that this morning he comes to your door saying the same old promises, his gaunt-faced and unkempt looking paramour on his arm, asking for $8000. He's been doing yoga you see, and this time he's sure he can kick the habit.

&gt; We talk about hormones being factors in both homosexuals and transgenders. Well is it possible that mismatched or imbalanced hormones are the cause of suicidal tendencies?

First: Transgender is an adjective, not a noun, so ""transgenders"" is a grammatical error.

Second of all, there's just no evidence of the ""imbalanced hormones"" in these groups causing suicidal tendencies, especially given that there isn't a hormone imbalance persisting... well, past *birth*. Additionally, there's some question as to whether this hormone imbalence even ever *exists*. It's one hypothesis for how people wind up being trans or gay, but there are other explanations involving epigenetics.

Well, I mean, you could argue that a pre-HRT trans person has a hormone imabelence that causes them to commit suicide on some occasions, but quite frankly, I think we'd both agree that that's not at all what you're getting at here. 

&gt;But it may very well be a correlation not causation.

Correlation typically means one of two things

1) A common cause of the two things that are correlated.
2) One thing causing the other.

This means that either there's a correlation between social prejudice and 

&gt;That mentality stops us from doing proper research and finding ways to really help these people.

I mean, what other research is there to be done? This has all been pretty well studied. What we know is that HRT and sex reassignment both cause decreases in the suicide rate among trans people, that these things do not lower the suicide rate to the global average, but they do substantially lower it. What we also know is that social acceptance dramatically lowers the suicide rate among trans people: In particular, for transgender teenagers, we know that 4% of those who feel their parents are accepting of their being trans attempt suicide... and of those who do not feel their parents are accepting, the number is closer to **50**%.

Ancient Athens was a pure capitalistic democracy. It was pretty awesome, until it lost the Peloponnesian war.

And the people who were trying to leave with those last helicopters were poor common people. The rich and exploitive? Get tried for crimes? They left because it was a country in war. They left because they could. That is the benefit of money. Poor people can't leave. It has nothing to do with getting tried for crimes.

Capitalism and democracy can and often do go together. Economics is closely tied to government. On the flip side of the coin, tell me how capitalism worked in the USSR. Tell me how it works in Korea. Tell me how it works in Angola. It doesn't. It only works in places with freedom like the US, England, Germany. The notable exception is China.

This demonstrates the intenet of what the the mother expected her son to do.

hakujin214,everymanshouldknow,1390077534.0,"Actually, the distinction between hiragana and katakana you are speaking of is a very recent development. As recent as during WW2, the okuri-gana and other phonetically written parts of Japanese were written in katakana rather than hiragana like it is now. Also, calling hiragana ""cursive"" is more accurate than you think as up until they started using block printing, the writing was connected like English cursive is.

Also, the example of Chinese and Japanese kanji/hanzi you gave uses simplified Chinese characters, which often have fewer strokes than the Japanese characters. Japanese uses its own set of simplified characters, too, but their system was developed separately and is now somewhere between the traditional characters used in Taiwan and other places and the simplified characters used in mainland China.

Finally, all three systems in Japanese were developed from Chinese characters, with hiragana and katakana being simplified kanji now only used phonetically. For example, あ comes from the character 亜. So saying ""Japanese [writing] is derived from Chinese"" is wrong is incorrect itself.

P.S. ねこ、ネコ、猫 are all cat. Saying the katakana is wrong is like saying ""cat"" and ""CAT"" are different words just because one is written in capital letters."

In response to the original: My first thought immediately was that you got yourself a rich brat. You have to keep in mind that usually the people that can afford sending their kids on exchange are fairly wealthy as such an exchange is incredibly expensive. 

___

The following are just some guesses, but maybe it gives you an insight on what his point of view is:

Very often kids are sent on exchange to give the parents a break during the ""difficult"" teenager time. At 15, kids in Germany often start acting out as they are trying to show that they are adults and not kids anymore. We have a lot more freedom here at this age. Kids try their first alcohol, first sex, the parents leave them on their own without a sitter for the first time so the first house parties and club experiences happen. You can purchase soft alcoholic drinks at the age of 16, get your scooter license and in school they start to use the formal way to address you (i.e. Miss and Mr). Then it's only  two more years until you're legally an adult and can drive a car and vote. Turning 16 and 18 in Germany are probably the two most important birthdays here as they mean ""freedom from parental oppression"". They don't mean that really but it's widely considered as such by children. 

Probably he thinks he is being sent away by his parents because they didn't want him around. There was probably a lot of fighting at home because he probably acted out. Probably he got drunk a couple of times, smoked, made friends with some older kids, did other stupid shit and the parents are trying to separate him from the bad influence of his group. He knows they sent him away at one of the most exciting times as a teenager (hey, he can legally drink and maybe get laid) and whilst he probably was excited about this at first (it's quite a prestige to go to the US), he probably was really pissed when he didn't end up in a major city he knew from the movies and realized that teenagers in the US live a much more sheltered life.


Regarding his condescending remarks towards the US:
In Germany due to the NSA scandal and the constant negative press about the USA (police out of control, aggression against niche groups, unnecessary war-mongering etc.), Germans actually do widely believe that the US is a conservative and backward civilization that is very restrictive of freedom and gets involved in shit they should keep out of. The USA is often considered to be a big bully on the rest of the world whilst it clearly doesn't have it's own country under control. 

Germans at the same time LOVE the USA for the entertainment it exports and the wild wild west romantics. 


We are also taught in school that American English is a bastard version of the ""original"" British English. This is because due to the significance of American pop music, kids are picking up ghetto slang (from rap videos etc) and the teachers are trying to prevent this. If you write ""fall"" instead of ""autumn"" in an assignment, it is marked as a mistake. In my school, even the American teacher taught us British English and only in 11th grade we we're allowed to chose which style we would use. 

I remember when I applied for an exchange, I had to go through a lot of assessment centers and had to keep my grades at 83% average to be even considered for the exchange. And the whole affair was ridiculous expensive.  It seems in your case they just paid for the exchange and there wasn't a screening, keep that in mind for the next year. 

____



You sound like a responsible guy. If you are the one that got him into the house, then I'd say regardless of what your family or teacher say, do what you deem the responsible thing in finding a solution. Having said this, quite honestly, you're parents are treating this as if you got a pet into the house and now don't want to clean after it. That's just wrong.

You could get some intel first and call his parents BUT don't complain, ask them how to handle the situation best. I'm pretty sure they'll be so embarrassed, they'll either talk to him and get him to cooperate or they'll call him back home. 

Then ask spoilt brat in a friendly and concerned elder brother tone if he doesn't like it at your family or why he is disrespecting the rules so much. Don't be angry or annoyed, just be concerned. If he says yes, ask him if he would like help to find a different place to stay. See where that goes. 


Edit: just checked your comment history and figured you're in Hawaii... man, this kid is so lucky! Most exchange students end up in a small town somewhere in the bible belt - that is a culture shock you dont want as  a teenager. I'd say definitely call his parents. Can you imagine what happens if they tell him: ""You'll either behave or your flying home with the first flight next Monday."""

Another example to sort of illustrate my point is the reality I face being African American. People look at me with suspicion due to the acts of a small percentage of African Americans, and while it's frustrating for me because I know the vast majority of black people aren't criminals, I can still sorta understand why people believe these ignorant stereotypes about blacks. That's why it upsets me immensely when I hear about a black person committing a crime, because I know at the end of the day their actions are going to fuel/justify negative stereotypes that will ultimately make my life harder. 

It's the same thing with Islam. Islamic terrorists make the whole religion look like shit, and unfortunately, most people aren't going to take a second and think, ""Well, it isn't the whole religion, it's just the extremists."" No, their first thought is going to be, ""Another muslim killed a group of innocent people, what a religion full of nut jobs.""

Journalists shouldn't need any protections other than the 1st Amendment.

scottious,getdisciplined,1390077753.0,"You illustrate a situation that I'm sure many many people have faced before.  I know I certainly have.  What worked for me was desensitization through constant exposure.

The only way desensitization to fear can work is by exposure.  Remember when you were a little kid and the fear of monsters in your closet or bugs in your bed was so real?  Over time, do you remember how this fear faded?  Do you look back at that fear and think, ""Man what was I so afraid of!?""

That's exactly what the fear you're facing is.  It's not real, it's just in your head.  Definitely easier said than done but trust me as somebody who's been there and come out the other side: it's something you can conquer, and once you do you open up a whole new world for yourself.

Every time you feel this fear or failure, think to yourself, ""This is actually a good thing.  I'm facing the fear head on and I'm not going to let it deter me.  I'm stronger than these fears.""

Always remember that not studying is putting you into debt.  Studying might invoke fear, but view it as paying down your debt, however slowly you view it.  Before you know it, you'll be out of debt and you'll be starting to accumulate intellectual wealth.  Success builds on itself."

I think I was about 6 and I stepped on a big chunk of broken glass that someone broke.

Hazlzz,mildlyinteresting,1390078224.0,"It's more fantasy than it is anything else. I strongly recommend it. The first book especially has this cool western feel to it, but it's set in a dying world. It gets more fantastical after that, there are portals to different worlds, including ours, and a lot of the magic/technology involved isn't explained very well (which I personally quite like in my fantasy literature), so it keeps a very mysterious atmosphere. There a small group of really well written characters (which I'd say is one of King's strong suits in general). It gets stranger and stranger, and more and more meta. There are several references made to other King novels, but it's not like you need to have read them to get it. 

If you're not into it at first I wouldn't force myself to continue though. King's main selling point is his style of writing, his prose is pretty recognizable. If you're not digging that then, well, don't hang around for the plot. I like the plot, but it's nothing remarkable, it's the way he tells the story that makes it good. "

Ask yourself what kind of person you want to be in 10 years and start building hobbies / habits that will get you those things.  There are any number of things that would be great to spend more time on and that you could learn to love.

I typically say ""transgender people.""

There are problems that can't be ""fixed"". 

&gt;Meaning, if they find it out what causes someone to be transgender they give you a pill and all of a sudden all those feelings are completely gone and you are completely happy.

Such a pill doesn't exist. Quite frankly, such a pill will *never* exist.

And no, I'm not sure it would even be a preferable treatment. You're fundamentally changing the underlying person.

Moreover, acceptance isn't a mere ""band aid"". Moreover, if we could make a pill that ""fixed"" the brain, why couldn't we make a pill that ""fixed"" the body, which would equally solve the problem in the absence of social oppression, and doesn't involve changing the actual person, since the brain is the person, not the body.

radio is the receiving/distribution end of it. all you get is the shiny products that people say are the ""best and most genuine songs from their hearts"" blah blah, and then feed it to the listeners, and they in turn feed it back into the industry with their money.

the industry is HIGHLY disengenous. ""chatting with the musicians and learning their hearts"" is meaningless. all they are giving you are the same rehearsed crap they know the middle-aged church goers want to hear.

It's an estimation based on statistics, probably self-reported statistics, and allows for condoms that are too big, *might* have a flaw, or break. 

It's not 2/100 condoms have flaws. It's 2/100 people relying on them for sole birth control over the course of their cycle, that may or may not be using them properly but certainly think they are. 

I just get so weary when they say there's a 2-3% failure rate for condoms when the reality is probably more like a 0.0002% failure rate if you count the success of individual condoms. I mean, a woman can use condoms successfully 10000 times but still gets counted as a ""fail"" if one condom fails. "

It does nothing for me to enhance the standing of the place itself.

Likewise for Gopher football, moving to the dome was the biggest error in the history of U of M sports. And there have been many. Totally lost the college vibe to move to a plastic bubble off campus. 

I never minded it for Vikings. They play later into the winter than the gophers. I'm not afraid to say screw the 'frozen tundra' lore. Football shouldn't be played in minus 0 weather. That's just ridiculous.

Your personal anecdote does speak of a specific woman who had power over you, yes. Most young boys would also probably consider their mother to have a lot of power. However that's irrelevant to our discussion of the definition of patriarchy, which concerns itself with gaining and maintaining social power and resources. One woman pushing you to get a job isn't necessarily a woman with loads of social power and resources -- she may have some power over you, but not over all of society. Plus you so handily explained that success at *her* job depended on *your* success in life -- so while her motives might have been callous, she was still dependent on *your* success in order to be successful herself. Is that power? Or a strange kind of symbiosis? Or is it totally irrelevant to the idea of power at all? I don't know. What I do know is that your story doesn't really demonstrate much of anything about patriarchy as a whole."

Him letting me know has only brought us closer. It kinda makes me feel even more special. I know he'd like to explore that side of his sexuality more and I've encouraged him to do so, as long as I'm aware of what he's doing. We've also discussed the possibility of a threesome. So far we haven't gone forward with any of this, unless you count dirty talk and me fucking him from time to time, heh. It's awesome how we can both be open about it.

If you feel your girlfriend is open-minded, I don't think there's any problem in telling her. Maybe see how she reacts if you bring it up and if she's comfortable with it, discuss her views on maybe exploring that side of you with her consent/her present. Spilling the beans all at once might be a bit much to her, if she has no idea. When you tell her, emphasise to her that you're committed to her and nothing in that front has changed, it's just that you've found this new side of yourself. She'll probably have questions, like how long you've felt like this and if you're still interested in her. Be honest and open. Give her time and space if she needs it. Talk to her. You'll be fine."

They admit right away that they're making things *for* males. (the video game industry is largely better on this than the comic book industry, but neither is perfect). It's often reflected in the male user-base, too -- any girl who wants to be part of the video game and comic book world will tell you how often and how viciously they are (figuratively) attacked by males in the fandoms; these girls get called fakers and sluts and idiots, they're told that women just don't ""belong"" in these spaces, etc.

Right, but since we're speaking in hypothetical, why is this preferable to

This would also solve the problem, and it would also dramatically increase a persons quality of life, and would be much more effective than current means of transition. In fact, it would be every bit as effective as your proposed solution. 

However, it would be substantially easier, and, moreover, it would be much more ethical, as it wouldn't involve changing someone's underlying personality. 

I think the fact that you immediately jump to fixing the brain shows some of your underlying biases; you are absolutely convinced (despite a reasonable amount of evidence to the contrary), that the way to fix trans people is in the mind. That's not what the experts say, though."

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390080159.0,"There's essentially no oil in Afghanistan, never was.  The US has not ever had any meaningful economic interest in Afghanistan.  It's a basically landlocked collection of mountain ranges.  

Some US and UK companies have gotten oil contracts in Iraq, but quite a lot of that is going to French and Russian companies.  The Iraqi's are not on the whole grateful for the 'freedom' the recolonization effort tried to bring them. 

Though it's not a trivial question to answer.  Lets say you spend 500 billion dollars over 10 years to invade Iraq.  Well, if you make 10 billion dollars a year on oil contracts for the next 50 years (assuming everything grows with inflation etc.) then you're net even.  But it hasn't been 50 years, and having a stable friendly ish government in Iraq that you don't have to keep bombing and enforcing a no fly zone over and that can spend 10's or of billions more every year buying american cars, computers and aircraft well.. then it pays off faster.  If an Iraq free from sanctions  can produce more oil and keep prices lower than they otherwise would have been (and that's very difficult to estimate) then there are broad economic benefits to everyone else that are not easy to put a  value on.  

Big economic questions like that are really not easy to answer.  The direct balance sheet costs - no the US is never going to recover the costs of this colonial venture, and nor will the British.  The british should have known better - colonies are a giant waste of money is exactly why they gave up on the business.  There will be another 80 years or so of costs for both countries to incur on this, as they deal with veterans costs and so on, so precise cost estimates are never going to really exist.  And the US doesn't own  Iraqi oil, even if US companies are  involved in its extraction and the Iraqi's aren't paying the US back the way countries  did after the first Gulf war, where the US was basically a giant mercenary force for all of the countries unlawfully threatened by Saddam Hussein.  

But the indirect effects, of an Iraq that could theoretically become a developed trade partner in the world, strategic effects on stability in the middle east could have paid off quite well.  They didn't of course.  

In Afghanistan it's much harder to really understand.  Afghanistan was basically dirt poor before, they're dirt poor now, and the US has more or less lost the war there completely.   Presumably Iraq is going to implode or end up in a civil war between Saudi and Iranian backed factions and that will mess up calculations there.  But Al qaeda only controls a small fraction of Iraq, whereas the Taleban and Al Qaeda are basically in charge in most of Afghanistan.  "

Willravel,TrueAskReddit,1390080216.0,"While there are also other factors at play, like average potential physical strength, societal gender roles do play a part, and I'd question the objectivity of anyone who denied this. 

Men are seen as being more physically aggressive, more combative, more competitive, and pain is seen as a test of one's metal. Men who do well in these areas can be and often are celebrated for being a masculine ideal of one kind or another, including sports stars. Women, on the whole, are new to this from a cultural perspective. Women have always been just as capable of demonstrating physical strength, being aggressive, being combative, competing, and enduring pain, but these were seen as masculine traits, and women who indulged these things were seen as masculine as a negative, as if they were somehow infringing on masculine domain. Similarly, men who happen to have traits traditionally associated with femininity were seen as being unmanly, as a negative. 

We're in a time in which this is slowly changing. Very recently, in the United States, women were finally given permission from the military to officially be in combat roles, even though women have been fighting in wars since the dawn of recorded human history. I'm not sure if it's sad or hilarious that we have this idea that women can't fight in wars, but the fact of the matter is that women can and do fight for their countries and communities every day. A lot of people may not know this, but back in 1980-81, when Selective Service was rebooted, the National Organization of Women sued to include women should there ever be a draft. 

Sports are not entirely dissimilar. In recent years, women's boxing has seen a huge spike in popularity, despite being a traditionally male sport. Women's soccer has become more and more popular over the past few decades, along with volleyball. I'm aware that some of the viewership of women's volleyball is about ogling (as if some people don't watch male athletes for the same reason), but I was involved with the Stanford women's volleyball team for about a year, and they're very much athletes operating at a very high level of physical skill, strength, and endurance. What you have to consider, though, is, just like in the military, we're in the middle of a long societal change. Attitudes like this take generations to change (or genderations, nyuk nyuk). 

I have a sneaking suspicion that the current trend in which women's sports are growing in popularity will continue going forward, along with a whole host of other inequalities slowly righting themselves because of the hard work of a few people who are willing to push unfair boundaries because of their belief in equality. 

All that having been said, I find sports incredibly boring regardless of the gender of the athlete. I'm as likely to watch an NBA game as I am a WNBA game. "

dizziik,Fitness,1390080980.0,"Okay, as a female who used to have *extremely* bad eating habits a lot like what you've discussed, so I may be able to offer at least a little insight.

For starters, you say that you have tried everything you can think of to help her but she just isn't willing to try. I can tell you this is probably because she is in some kind of denial about her body and habits. For a long time I was very sick every day, food made me feel gross, I would eat maybe 300-400 calories all day and then binge around 9:30-10pm, and wonder why I feel like shit the next day. I thought I must have some kind of illness, never gave a thought to what I was putting in my body. It's very hard to look critically at yourself, especially concerning weight/food issues so she may also have a bit of selective blindness to her issues. You're the closest person to her and criticizing her may make her less willing to try anything.

**That being said**, you are probably the closest person to her in life, so if you have a genuine concern about her health, and have shared this concern with her, she needs to listen and visit a doctor or nutritionist. I did, prompted by my boyfriend (whose concerns I dismissed at first, just like your GF), when test ruled out all diseases except malnutrition, it was a huge eye-opener that I was fucking up my body with my food choices. 

Also, I found it very difficult to move to a normal diet/schedule even after I'd already accepted that I needed to change. I was still associating food with feeling sick and yucky and shitting my brains out, so I didn't *want* to eat 3-4 times a day! I ended up talking it out with a therapist who was of the opinion that through my shitty behavior I'd developed a bit of an eating disorder (negative associations with food/binging). I was able to work through it though.

What worked for me was SMALL changes. Like, I started with breakfast. Slowly adding more and more to my routine as I got accustomed to the change. Once I was eating healthier I noticed a difference in my health probably within the first week. 


So, sorry for the wall of text. Just remember that females tend to internalize criticism and blame and that makes it even harder to accept facts and change your life.

You said she complains about the prices at some places- the unfortunate fact is that plus size clothing is more expensive. And frankly, if you buy cheap clothes, they're going to look cheap, feel cheap, and wear out faster, which means replacing your clothes more frequently and spending more in the long run. Some stuff is fine to be cheap about (getting cheap tanks and t-shirts, especially for layering) but for others it's not a good idea.

As /u/arumberg said, check the link in the sidebar for a pretty good list of clothes, their general price ranges, and size ranges.

Relax, people saying things can be cause to say 'that sounds offensive to me, can you explain?' but shouldn't be taken so personally or as an affront.

He may have underestimated the girl's attachment to the fly after the fact, which in hindsight he may have not done it. But still, in the moment he probably figured there were plenty more flies.

I dont think he's sick, just a bit eccentric.

MidnightSlinks,AskWomen,1390081206.0,"I never said it was easy for anyone, but as a former division I athlete who gained 15 pounds of muscle in 4 months by working out 15-20 hours per week and eating until I was painfully full 4 times per day, I can guarantee you that I'm informed on the personal experience/anecdotal front.

I'll agree that men need to have more muscle than women to be considered ideally attractive, but women are encouraged to get to a low percent body fat *without* putting on muscle, which, having done both, is much harder than putting on muscle and keeping a low-normal %bf.

There are also more structural issues that women have to contend with. You can work specific muscle groups to get them bigger/stronger (though calves are notoriously hard to hypertrophy), but you can't spot treat fat and you certainly can't *add* fat to the desired places, which is often what women are told we should have in addition to a flat stomach and toned arms."

UlgraTheTerrible,offmychest,1390081234.0,"Look dude: 

I don't fucking dance for your shit, especially after you accuse me of having my panties in a twist over correcting the statistics. 

You want the study? It's called common goddamn sense and slight knowledge of how these ""statistics"" are arrived at. You *actually* think they survey people about the condom viability of every sexual encounter they have? 

No, they don't. Why? Because that would cost a lot of money, whereas studying the pregnancy rates of people reporting condoms as their only form of birth control is a lot easier, but *very obviously* doesn't give you the full story. 

Fact is, the odds of you being in the unlucky 2% during a one-night stand if you have sex once a year and use a condom are (guesstimate) probably around 1/10000 or even higher. 

But here, I'll help you out. 

&gt;This means that only about 2 in every 100 women would get pregnant in the course of a year.

So, let's assume that each of those 100 women have sex twice a week. So that's 2 x 52 = 104. Take that amount, times it by 100 (because there are 100 women)... So, 10400 condoms. We can't *really* know how many failed due to ovulation cycles and viability of pregnancy, but let's just say that 2, *for sure* failed. 

2/10400 condoms definitely failed. That denominator goes higher if the average amount of sex the women are having turns out to be more than twice a week. 

So... Yeah. There. My ""sources""... Basic fucking math. 

I hope you're fucking happy. "

bitcoin is designed to become exponentially harder to mine the more there are in existence, basically it is supposed to become harder to make bitcoins faster than hardware is increasing in speed.

Also, bitcoin value relies on supply and demand, if everyone was making bitcoins you'd flood the market with coins and their worth would go down.

Renner1,syriancivilwar,1390081318.0,"I disagree. 

Plenty of monsters and sociopaths on the Israeli side, certainly. People who piss on the Palestinians for decades on end, and commit dozens of injustices and atrocities, and then whine and bitch, and expect the world to do so with them, whenever Israelis get hurt or killed.

There are certainly some Palestinians who've done bad things, or unjustifiable things, but all of this is based around how Israel and the majority of Israelis have behaved in regard to Palestine as a country and the Palestinian people. 

But in this Syrian war, I would say most of the people on both sides aren't inherently evil.

The die hard Salafi Jihadis and takfiris, sure. Some commander or some paramilitaries on Assad's side who have used the conflict as a way to bully or beat or kill indiscriminately, sure.

But there are plenty of people in the proper FSA who have very valid, decent reasons for fighting-- and likewise with the SAA and the Kurds."
