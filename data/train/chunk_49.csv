It's NOT unrealistic to want her to display SOME degree of passion/interest in you, though.  Yes, it's hard to keep the fires stoked in a LTR, but it's possible when both partners actively work at it.  Unfortunately, too many people just assume that if they don't feel it at the moment, nothing is there.  They don't realize that maintaining intimacy, excitement, etc with a long term partner is partially a choice, and takes effort.  

Honestly though, it sounds like she's not into you aside from the comfortable aspects of your relationship, and if that's the case, I doubt you're going to convince her to put the effort in. :/"

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1391160169.0,"Too many factors involved we don't know about such as:

What is your relationship like with your parents?
How socially liberal/tolerant are they of ""alternative lifestyles""?
Do you depend on your parents for material aid?
Is your new relationship serious, or more of a casual thing?
Etc etc etc.

I think for anyone but the most hippy of parents, it's best to wait until you have an established polyamory situation where you are fairly sure you're going to be with the new partner for quite a while AND that you are going to stick with polyamory as a lifestyle for quite a while.  It's not a great idea to share this with your parents and possibly create a ton of drama if you're going to end up being mono again in 5 months, y'know?

I'm not technically poly, I'm in an open marriage, which I view as more of a sexual thing than a romantic thing, and my rule is that my parents don't need to know about my sex life (or have a right not to know about my sex life!)  If I ended up getting in a committed relationship with another person, I'd have to reconsider because that would change the situation from primarily sexual to something else entirely."

Now smuggling in food is good, but could be difficult. How good are the cooks? Could you ask them to prepare something special for you? It would probably be easiest to get them to make something like brownies or a slice because they go straight into the trays in the ovens.

Does the site have a pool? It's so bloody hot here that even I am thinking that a swim would be nice. Of course there will be other blokes wanting to use the pool, so you can't have too much fun.

Also, dating at work, man?  Usually a bad idea....

You say your 4 year relationship with your gf has been ""rocky"" but it's ""better now"".  Well, you can try to open up, assuming she's willing (not anything in your post about how you think your gf would react, btw, which is telling...) but I am not convinced your relationship has a stable enough foundation to make poly work even again, assuming your gf would agree, and assuming all her insecurities wouldn't be triggered by the fact that you want to open the relationship to legitimize the emotional affair you're having with a co-worker.

I take Omega's, fish oils, a B complex, and folic acid (as my medication decreases levels of that for some reason) in addition to my medications, and it seems to help a little bit with my energy levels but otherwise doesn't do much. 

So... While taking vitamins is generally a good idea for everyone, it is *not* going to treat/cure your mood disorder... Medications are still your best bet for maintaining control of your bipolar... Vitamins... *might* make you slightly less tired after lunch, which is about all they really do for me. 

However, if you're interested in gaining more control than your medications provide, I cannot recommend CBT enough... Possibly DBT, but CBT is the one I've actually had, and it has helped immensely. 

Bipolar comes in two parts, you see. First, there's the biological/chemical part, which you can't really do much about without real medications... But then, there's the purely psychological part... The way your brain is programmed to think/act... 

And because there's something wrong with the chemistry, we often *learn* to process things a little bit... well... wrong... But luckily, while we can't help the chemistry, we *can* help to undo some of the damage to our programming.. 

CBT is like debugging, really... We can't help that our hardware is going to make things difficult, but we can reprogram and optimize our software for dealing with the shitty hardware. "

I can ask my partner to just leave me alone because I don't want to say something mean to him and I don't want to be around people.

I should still sing to my co-worker because it's not about me and I don't need to make someone else feel down. But I can say I am feeling off-weather and duck out before cake.  

It is wrong to expect women to be cheery. But that is different than expecting someone to act within their normal bounds. If you are use to affection from someone and it is suddenly withdrawn it is polite and considerate to at least let them know they are not at fault.

I generally try to remove myself from social interaction (so I don't take it out on people). What I tell people varies depending on how close of a relationship I have. I will tell my friends that I am grumpy as fuck and don't approach me without tea and cookies, or that I had an awful nightmare about whatever and have still felt heartbroken all day. And if I feel like I need to mention anything at work I may say I've felt ill or have a head ache but will probably just be curt and down-to-business with everyone.

Well then, the most obvious soloution I can come up with is to start an independent scout group and start looking for other independent scout groups in your vicinity so that you can join up and form an organization there everyone is welcome! 

To only have one scouting organization for boys, a christian one, seems like an awfull idea to me. In Sweden, untill recenly we had three organizations:  
The Swedish Scouts union/association(I don't know of a good translation, unfortunately)  
Swedish Mission union/association Young Men/Young Women Scouts union/assotiation and lastly  
the Sobriety union/assosiation scout assosiation.

These unions have now merged into one organisation, The Scouts.  
Anyways, my point is that if you want to join a scout group that is associated with a church, there are a few. But if you belong to a different religion, or no religion at all, there is no requirement to join a scouting organization where you have to follow the rules of any religion other than your own, and everyone is welcome to jain the scouts. So if you feel that you don't agree with the values of your organization, why not pull together a bunch of likeminded people and tart your own?

Fuck, I started rambling there. I'm kinda tired today and this is an issue that kind of pisses me off, sorry. Anyway, think about it!"

L1M3,elderscrollsonline,1391162479.0,"&gt;Zenimax has maneuvered themselves into a lose-lose situation.

Truer words, yadda yadda.

I've pre-ordered the Imperial Edition already. That said, I've been planning to get whatever deluxe edition they had ever since the last beta weekend. I'm not planning on playing an imperial for my first or even second character. In fact, I desperately hope that there's a way to unlock imperials in-game, probably at level 50. Also, the Rings of Mara are said to be in the game already. The white horse and mudcrab pet should remain exclusive to the Imperial Edition.

However, ZOS would never, ever make all of the Imperial Edition content available in-game because they want players to continue to upgrade to the Imperial Edition.

But if they do make playable imperials unlockable in-game plenty of people will complain. It may or may not be as bad as it was yesterday, but there will be plenty of people upset. Probably most of them will be players not currently on this subreddit who bought the Imperial Edition just before launch.

onewordmemory,AdviceAnimals,1391163438.0,"random braindump incoming, feel free to just skip as i'm not disagreeing with anything you said. but to quickly answer your last question:

the short answer is i don't know. i dont have the medical background on fetal development to make an informed decision. you can be super cynical and say abortion is okay whenever, simply take the fetus out and see if it [survives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability). a more sensible argument would be to allow abortions while the fetal viability is 0% but after that assume enough time has been given to make the decision and a commitment has been made. im not really sure what you mean by ""after [birth]"", i'm pretty sure after-birth-abortion is just adoption..

coherent counter arguments. heavily dependent on base assumptions, which i suppose is the root of the argument. for the record, my position for the sake of the discussion is that fetus is a child and abortion is murder (i dont actually believe it, but it seems a fair concession, otherwise it'd be moot point as there would be no issue).

to continue with the climbing analogy, if your harness fails are you entitled to grab onto someone else if theirs can only hold 1 person? someone who tries to prevent pregnancy but fails, tries to do ""responsible"" thing and not have the child they can't care for yet forced to do it anyway, may feel like they have no control over anything in their lives (similarly with rape), may push them towards suicide, self-abortion, self-mutilation, subsequent child abuse, etc. in this case you may be saving the child's life by sacrificing their parent's.

this goes back to me conceding that a fetus is a child and hoping the opposition simply accepts that abstinence isnt an option. i do consider sex to be a basic human need. we can all live off bread and water, sleep in a tent outside, and not shower more than once a year, but this isn't exactly what one would call normal/desirable life, similarly i dont think avoiding sex is healthy for anyone.

my argument was never that pregnancy is a punishment or that sex is sinful. the whole point of 'abstinence isnt option' is that sex is good and people should have as much of it as they want. pregnancy itself is most definitely not punishment. *forcing* someone to go through unwanted pregnancy would be the punishment, but since it punishes not only them, but others around, it's not an option for me either."

Why hadn't he decided? 

Because doing Smaug was an enormous job and on films like these you just don't have any extra time. Also he didn't have the insight when finishing the AUJ theatrical Smaug of knowing exactly what he needed Smaug to do in Desolation and There and Back Again. 

I'm sure they thought he would have four legs, but decided when making Desolation that the animation would be much cooler if he used his wings to crawl around instead of walking like a four-legged animal. If you watch all the scenes inside Erebor featuring Smaug I think you'll agree that Smaug wouldn't be as intense if he was simply ""walking"" throughout the scenes. "

ikkleste,magicTCG,1391164381.0,"It's not even necessarily just being sued. Breaking a promise could be very bad for their brand reputation. People are willing to spend money on the hobby because they know the cards will retain some value. In theory they could sell up and get back some of the value they've invested back, this makes the hobby seem cheaper, even if they never do cash in. Sure you've invested £5000 on cards but you've got a £5000 collection out of it. Reprints (often) drop the value of cards particularly potentially the higher value really rare cards.

The price of these cards that they made the promise on (on the reserved list) are higher exactly due to the reserved list. If they were to break the promise these cards would likely see some drop in value (maybe not totally, an really old collectable volcanic island would probably still be worth significantly more than a new reprinted one were they to do that.) due to a reprint, but would also see a drop due to not being a safe investment anymore.

The only reason someone will pay $200 dollars for a dual land is that due to the promise they know they'll keep that value. Removal of the promise would probably cause a price drop even if they didn't reprint anything.

Breaking the promise and printing something on the reserved list shows that their promises are poor. While they are much more careful about explicit promises, these days (they don't). There's still an unspoken compact between wizards and customers that they'll at least consider the effects of prices on reprints. This can be seen in some of the recent reprint sets (modern masters) where not every chase card was reprinted and there was a limited amount produced. Sure some cards lost a little value but most collections were protected in large. If they'd gone too far and bombed the value of everything, that would ruin peoples faith in investing in the future. No cards would reach the levels of price we see now.  This in turn means what they can charge for fresh printed cards would inevitable drop (or demand, and therefore what they actually care about sales, would drop).

TL;DR: Creating a brand trust you can trust gives people faith in the value of the cards they purchase. This helps drive new sales. Part of this brand trust is not breaking promises you made (foolishly before you knew better) and following a sensible reprint policy now (even if you don't make explicit promises on it."

He ended up with 2 dogs and fish and no kids. He got to keep one of the dogs after the break-up and, from what I hear, he seems to be thriving and relieved he got pets instead of kids.

UlgraTheTerrible,offmychest,1391165269.0,"Right, well. 

First off, the teacher was an asshole. I think everyone knows that. I think you know that. 

But the thing is, assholes are everywhere, and *you* need to be prepared to deal with them in an appropriate manner. Odds are, because you, like me, are a woman, someone out there is going to call you a slut, or a skank, or a whore, or a bitch *just because you had the audacity to be born without a penis* a.k.a. because they're bitter at women for some reason or you're doing something they don't like... Welcome to life with a uterus. 

Fact is, **if you let them** they will have you hiding in your basement, afraid to even go outside, let alone something as simple as wearing shorts... 

So, what I'm trying to say here, in the gentlest way possible, is that while your teacher was the asshole, you're the one with the problem at the moment... And it isn't that your teacher said that, **it's that you're still letting what that asshole said affect you.** 

So, my suggestion here is **stop letting him win**... because he has, if you've altered your behavior to conform to his ideal, even years later. 

And if you just *can't* stop letting him win, I think you could probably benefit from some extensive therapy, because stuff like this is going to continue to happen intermittently throughout your life, and it would be really really great if you didn't give yourself a complex over everything.

notdeadanymore,sex,1391165519.0,"I was with a great guy for three years - we broke up because the sex was awful. He was the one person I was supposed to be sexually intimate with, the one person who should have made me feel desired and beautiful. But sex with him just made me feel so terrible about myself - used and violated and ugly and disconnected and just... ugh. I know, it sounds so extreme, you think it could never happen to you, right? He was honestly so great and loving in every other aspect of our relationship. We were doomed by sexual inexperience and being incompatible.

I think you've underestimated how powerful sex in a relationship can be emotionally. I never feel closer to my (now) boyfriend than when we're having sex. If I'm upset or angry... sex always makes me feel better. It makes me feel loved, connected, wanted, desired, beautiful, confident, sexy... it's just not about the physical pleasure for me. It improves my entire day. It strengthens us as a couple.

Having now experienced a fulfilling sexual relationship, I would never go back. Great sex is an absolute necessity in my romantic relationships.

Here's what I didn't know at 16: that I was capable of falling in love for a second time. With my first love, I thought - surely I could never feel this way about anyone else? My current boyfriend is my third love, and he's perfect and amazing and I'd be lucky to share my life with him... but I also know that, if it doesn't work out, I'll find love again. I don't have to settle for a relationship that has a huge flaw like sexual incompatibility because there's no such thing as The One. We get a choice in the matter, which is awesome!

I will say that my brother and my sister both married their first partners. My two best friends both got married at twenty years old. All four of those couples started dating as teenagers. I believe that young love can work. I would just advise you to invest in your relationship sexually, to realise that it can be a powerful emotional bond, that it can make your love even stronger."

Without the poly element, some of this sounds like it belongs in /r/deadbedrooms .  Your sexual relationship with your husband is less than ideal.  It sounds like he has a lot of hangups and insecurity around sex, and isn't particularly sex-positive.

I think you need to step back and think seriously about whether or not you WANT to work on fixing this with your husband, or if your mismatched libidos and sexual values and compatibility is a deal breaker, and being open/poly is just a way to cope with that instead of breaking up.

If you really DO want to stay in the relationship with him, you should return to monogamy for now and focus on seeing if you two can learn to create a sex life that fulfills both of you."

I also know that 95% of the time, once sex starts, even if I'm not into it to begin with, I'll end up getting into it and having a great time.

I think some women become LL's because they fail to realize that they can have sex without necessarily wanting sex (and I don't mean violating your personal boundaries and feeling violated after, I mean starting from a point of wanting to do something nice for you SO even if you're not feeling horny) and that can increase the sexual connection between people and jump start your own libido.

While your technique is great, the placement of your colors makes your eyes look even further apart than they are. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty, and you don't look bad at all, but I really think taking that into consideration would take you from good to amazing.

I had one friend I really cherished, we had a similar sense of humor, spent hours talking on the phone, etc.  But I wasn't physically attracted to him.  He eventually told me, on the phone, that he thought of us as being ""in a relationship"".  I was like ""Uh, can I respond to that?"" and he said ""No, just think about it, I've got to go, but let's talk tomorrow.""

I being 16 and maybe not that emotionally mature ended up avoiding him for a few weeks because I was torn. I adored him as a friend and didn't want to break his heart, but I was angry that he decided we were in a relationship without my consent, and nervous about being around him knowing how he felt for me.  Our friendship never recovered.  I don't know if it could have if I'd just talked with him frankly and told him I didn't feel the same way.

The other guys who were interested in me after we were friends I didn't value that much as friends, and found that once I told them I wasn't interested in them romantically they ended up not talking to me.  So they were only my friends as long as they thought they had a shot.

allihaveismymind,nethack,1391167543.0,"XP needed for a new level double every time, that's why gaining levels slows down once ~9 or so. Up to 13-14 is doable with only killing monsters, but it's slow - if this is the way you have to go, explore down towards the castle as others have advised. You can also camp at an altar, but unless you have lots of CM, this is probably slower than exploring.

Other common ways to gain levels are drinking PoGL (if you have a blessed one, always drink that last for the 'half level' XP bonus) or eating wraiths (can summon with cursed genocide!). 

Assuming you are lvl 11, have a wraith corpse next to you and one unblessed and one blessed PoGL, do it in this order:

* eat wraith for level 12

* drink unblessed PoGL

* drink blessed PoGL

This will get you to lvl 14, with enough XP that you are halfway to lvl 15 (*blessed* PoGL!), saving you half lvl 15 if you need to kill monsters to get 16. If you are *below* lvl 11 in this example it is better to reach it via normal killing first (with the exception of the w corpse of course) - this lower level will be completed faster, so drink the potions later.

- Deep Purple
- The Doors
- Coheed &amp; Cambria (my favourite band as of now)

Here is a very realistic hypothetical:

There is a board of directors that control a company, 6 men and 1 woman (statistically accurate). They all marry each other so they can get legal benefits that protect them from certain laws.

This cannot exist currently because men cannot marry other men AND no one can marry more than one person. Given societal norms, it's very possible that polygamy marriage could exist only as a man marrying multiple women."

partialinsanity,IAmA,1391169915.0,"Studies show that fans who are engaged in sharing and downloading also spend more than others on legal copies and merchandise. This is hardly a surprise. Some authors have actually realised this, and encourage freedom, because they know that people who like their works are likely to pay for it.

The sharing of culture and knowledge results in people trying something before buying it, or even discovering something new which they wish to support so they do that. People who wish to listen to music but can't afford to pay for it, will get free copies (as we did before the internet) and they become people who support the artists later on.

The truth is also that the entertainment industry and publishers have been protecting their monopoly on producing copies.

Authors and publishers once tried to stop the public library from ever becoming a reality, because they said people would never pay for books they could read for free, and no one would ever write or publish anything anymore. History has shown that the opposite happened. They even wanted a law against people borrowing and lending books to each other.

Then radio became the new threat. If people can listen without paying, how can we sell music then? And what if several people listen to the same radio?

Cassette tapes was also a threat. People copying music from each other in school, so called home taping, was literally killing the music industry!

When Sony introduced the VCR, they were sued for copyright infringement. A machine that would let people make their own copies of TV broadcasts, including TV series and movies? Another threat. Until they learned how to embrace new technology instead of telling people what kind of machines they are allowed to invent, produce, sell and use.

We now live in an era of relatively cheap and powerful computers, which are machines made to perform calculations and process data. Part of that is the ability to make copies of data. Add to that the infrastructure to transmit data all over the globe, and you get a world where copying and sharing is easier than ever before. And it will only get easier. As easy it is to do today, that is how hard it will ever get. This is a fact. The real question is, how do you choose to adapt to that fact?"

2. TDC tjener 3.7 mia.kr. (est. 2013). Det er ~1000 kr. per voksen dansker, skabt på en omsætning på ca. 25 mia.kr.. eller 15%. Til sammenligning tjener fx Verizon 9.5%. På det grundlag synes jeg ikke man kan sige konkurrencen er hård (for TDC). Rigtig mange lavprisselskaber er ejet af TDC: M1, fullrate, Telmore , og deres eksistensgrundlag er mest kapring af kunder, ikke en teknisk ydelse eller et net. Telenor og 3 er undtagelserne.
3. Ja, og når du får din første kvartals-regning, vil du opdage at hovedparten stadig går til DONG for distributionsnettet og -ja- til skatter (som så derefter delvist går til DONG i støtte). I Jylland er det nok en anden sag (også med TDC). Jeg har selv valgt DONG fra."

* How much better I feel, physically. Seriously, you will too. My chest is sobbing and thanking me profusely (even though I wasn't a heavy smoker by any means, between 4 and 8 roll-ups a day. 
* Money talks - it's a tangible gain from quitting, my pockets are heavier, and yours will be too.
* Use NRT. Patches, gum, lozenges, even an e-cig (though I don't think these are the best idea, didn't work for me on a permanent basis) - you still need that willpower, but your chances of quitting really are much greater. Just don't forget, if you're using a patch... my first day of non-smoking, I forgot (!) and lit up, felt very sick indeed.
* Finally, an appeal to vanity: if you don't quit, you'll age quicker. Your skin will look gross, seriously. Also, once you quit, you'll notice that smokers *smell*. We stink. You'll think to yourself... oh god, I can't believe I smelled like that, surely not. You did, though, unless you changed your shirt and showered/brushed teeth after every cig.

Poptartica,summonerschool,1391174018.0,"Honestly if you are winning with jax you should keep at it if you just want to climb. If you're bored of that then fair enough. As teemo you do somewhat have to rely on your team allowing you to splitpush to be able to fully utilize his strengths. Of course a fed teemo can 1v1 easily but teamfight wise you do need a team that is ready/able to engage if someone steps on a shroom or etc (make no mistake though this is pretty deadly for them). Also imo botrk is not a must buy on him esp if you are AP. Your shrooms should be providing the slow since you will be wanting to get them everywhere you can due to their massive damage. I would get botrk if i was hybrid or bruiser but personally i rarely see anything other than ap.. and bruiser: only really if the teemo looks like he might be 10000% countered in lane it seems.

And if you can split push.. if you get 2+ people chasing you through a shroomed jungle, that's ideal imo. This is generally when your team swoops in and grabs baron, a turret, or an inhibitor for free (or easier/mininal effort) while you move quick away with possibly 2-3 enemies getting to half health or less from your annoying mushroom maze in their jungle.

Just realize that some champs will be very hard for you (maybe even counter you and you should reserve him for a different matchup in that case), and an important part of being useful to your team is knowing how to still pressure the map constantly as teemo even if you lost your lane."

indiecore,AskReddit,1391174656.0,"Scallops.

Now a lot of people will tell you that wrapping them in bacon and frying them up is the way to go but they're wrong.

What you want to do is fry the bacon up and then set it aside. Use the grease to fry the scallops (which should be fresh, not frozen and the big kind from the ocean not the little once and patted dry with some paper towels). Fry them till they're sort of squishy (think rare steak) and golden brown on the outside. When the bacon is cool crumble it over a nice bed of spinach, lettuce and other leafy greens and mix in the scallops you just made. A bit of a salt and pepper to tase, maybe a little red wine or balsamic vinegar as dressing and you'll have the greatest food known.

If you're looking for the second best food it's Mussels, just put them in a pot and cook till they're all open. Serve with butter. "

Personally, I do feel more secure knowing they are there.  I'm never rude to them...never would be.

The worst flying experience I had was landing at Gatwick airport in the UK.  My small plane landed at the same time a large plane from Africa landed.

I had to be in the non-UK/Europe line because I'm American.  I forget whether or not I still had the official passport at this time, or whether I had the normal one.  I was going to the UK for college.

Anyway, there was a long line of Africans in the non-Europe line.  Customs agents started to come down the line and tell all the white people in line to go ahead and go to the front of the line.

This was probably about 1990.

They got to me and asked where I was going and where I was from and looked at my passport.  They said, ""Go to the front of the line.""

I said, ""I'm ok waiting.""

They said, ""But we said you can go to the front of the line.""


I said, ""Look...I'm American...we don't just jump to the front of the line because we're white in my country.  I'm fine waiting.""

Well...needless to say, I made a few quick African friends who were totally delighted and I would never see them again...but they got a lot of amusement out of the exchange.

When I got to the front of the line, the border agent absolutely HAMMMERED me with a deluge of questions about why I was in the country - college - where I was coming from.  What my parents did...all kinds of shit.

But it was worth it...remembering all of those giant grins I got for telling the border agent that THIS white girl wasn't going to jump to the front of the line."

You're not going to find that people agree about that number, which is why the term ""slut"" is nothing but useless sexist bullshit that I'll define how I wish because it's inherently meaningless.

In the meantime, you can criticize my writing all you want, but the fact remains that a guy who wants to have a happy married sex life should make sure he marries a woman who is sexually confident, communicative, and prioritizes her own sexual pleasure.  In this day and age, most women who really enjoy sex have had prior partners, probably ""too many"" for you redpillers to consider marriage material.  Y'all have set yourself up for failure by a false dichotomy about the nature of female sexuality.  That might be a bitter pill to swallow, but it's the truth."

It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.""

I think you are boiling down that case into something simpler to understand. Laws and amendments can be argued. Just because someone was misinterpreted prior does not mean that correcting that mistake is taking away any rights.

I assume that you would agree with this statement:

&gt; ""The Court would have us believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons.... I could not possibly conclude that the Framers made such a choice.""

However, that has nothing to do with the drive to criminalize abortion, which happened in the mid - late 1800's. From what I understand this had to do with three things:

1. It was much less safe than it is today (as were most surgeries back then)

2. Changing ideas about pregnancy and when life begins. People did not think that a fetus was alive until ""quickening,"" or when the woman could feel it move. Better medical information changed this. 

3. The growing power of medical schools, the American Medical Association, etc. When the credentials a doctor needed was more formal, there was a huge push to convince women that midwives were unsanitary and incompetent and that they should use MD's instead. Part of this campaign involved creating the idea that midwives only did abortions and unsafe ones at that.

Two things going on here: 1) they may have sized you incorrectly (did they have you try them on in more than 1 size?) or 2) you're not used to breaking in full grain leather shoes. It takes a while dude. People sometimes get blisters breaking in Red Wings, but afterwards, it's the most comfortable shoe they own. I highly doubt you'd make a statement like that unless you've actually broken in a thick cowhide shoe before.

It is also entirely possible that CDBs are *not* for your foot *shape*. Did Nordstrom even measure your Brannock size when you got there? They're better for wider feet, and run a half, to a full size large depending on the shape of your foot. That's just different strokes man, and what you say doesn't necessarily apply to everyone else.

&gt;  I get home and it feels like I'm walking on a pebble. Turns out the hard sole doesn't extend all the way to the back of the shoe, leaving this ""cliff"" of comfort that makes them unbearable.

I don't know what you mean about ""hard sole"" on the Sperries, and while I get that they're ""shit quality"", I also think that boat shoes aren't *supposed* to have a hard sole. They're supposed to have a fairly flexible sole for, you know, walking on a deck and/or beach. Get different shoes if you'll be walking a lot in them.

I know, he had weird ideas about parental motivation.

Anyway, I took the test. I nailed the parallel parking, the three-point-turn, the lane changes. Right before the end, I roll through a STOP sign in order to see down the road more clearly.

I should have failed the test. Instant traffic violation while driving.

Anyway, for reasons of his own, the driving examiner passes me. Since then, the NY license has gotten me licenses to four other states and jurisdictions, numerous I-9 employment forms, a number of background checks, and countless bars.

eetsumkaus,malefashionadvice,1391178060.0,"CDBs definitely aren't for everyone. The circlejerk here is that they're a versatile shoe for *everyone*, which is simply not true. However, for an $85 shoe, like many have said here, you're really not gonna get much better.

&gt; They're scuffed up when I take them out of the box, but before the thought fully materialized that they might be seconds, I realized that they were scuffed up because they were existing in the box. The leather feels like fiberboard to the touch, and discolored when I put my foot in. And every time I take a step. And when I think about them too hard.

Essentially this is just part of building a patina. It's part of the character of the boot. Will they look like dress shoes? Probably not. But they'll still look cool with a few *more* scratches and scuffs and dark spots. That's what a patina is, all of that built up. Take a look at [my own pair](http://i.imgur.com/fH4cdSP.jpg). It has a certain amount of charm to it, and the beeswax leather certain builds up a really rough patina that appeals to certain people.

&gt; Incredibly awkward to walk around in, my ankles are rattling around in them like straws in an empty fast food cup. No give or comfort to them; I wanted to wear them around this weekend, but they're going to kill my feet in ways my metatarsal workboots could only dream about.

It's entirely possible that the shape of the CDB just isn't for your foot. For a regular to narrow width, they recommend sizing down a FULL size on the CDBs, and then just have them break in in the waist, or the middle part of the foot (trust me on this, I'm a EE width and I've broken in D width shoes before to be comfortable).

It seems to me that it's not a stretch to guess that the people who live in more densely populated areas with more active police and less places to hide are going to be more likely to get caught smoking pot than people who have the ability to go for a walk in the woods. Racial social inequality is certainly a factor in who lives where, but I'm not sure that exactly necessarily translates into any meaningful proportion of cops deciding to target black people.

So I think you might want to clarify with him on that as well. I agree with what others have said and try to find a compromise. I'm personally doing something more like what you're wanting, with just an intimate ceremony at a park, with just a few family members with us. It suits us to do something low key and intimate, and I just wanted something a bit more personal and tailored to us than going to the courthouse. 

And if you're doing it in a field, or someplace like that, you would still need a legal officiant (justice of the peace, or even a friend that gets certified for the day, or whatever type of officiant you like) to perform the ceremony and sign your marriage license. And this ceremony isn't religious at all, unless you actually want that and ask for it from a priest, etc. "

MissCherryPi,SRSFeminism,1391179083.0,"So I have been thinking about this article since I read it on Wednesday. 

I don't understand how women criticizing #FemFuture ruined it. Why didn't Martin et. al engage in good faith and continue? I suppose it's easy for me to say because I'm not the one who organized a conference to talk about the future of feminism and then got called a racist by a lot of people on Twitter, but I think if you want to be an ally you must be able to take constructive criticism. 

If you remember, this happened a few years ago with the call for contributions to ""Yes Means Yes."" It was hugely criticized, and then Jessica Valenti and Jaclyn Friedman apologized, took it down and rewrote it and went on to publish a GREAT book. Why couldn't that have happened with the #FemFuture project?
 
I legit don't understand how white women feminists who deal with a million misogynist trolls a day can't handle a black woman saying ""Hey, check your privilege, that thing you said was out of line."" I don't think that Mikki Kendall or Sydette Harry or any other big name WoC feminist on twitter is a bully. 

And like I said on twitter, I am a HUGE fan of Michelle Goldberg, I've met her in person a few times, she autographed a book for me and we talked about when I was a clinic escort. I think that valid criticisms of many WW feminists don't negate everything else amazing that they do. Activism isn't a zero sum game. 

That being said, *there were women of color who participated in #FemFuture, and who do participate in other large feminist blogs and websites.* I want to know more about why their participation wasn't considered to be valid. It's not my place to weigh in on conversations occurring exclusively between WoC. But if they are speaking to a larger audience, and asking me as a white woman to listen, and not to read, link or participate in sites that exclude WoC, I have to admit I don't understand why Anna Holmes, Samhita Mukhopadhyay etc. don't count.

&gt; If time really is like space,

That's not what timespace means, at all. Not even a little. Quantum specifically talks about things which are time irreversible, meaning that if you *did* run the clock backward things would *not* reconfigure the same way they had been before. Time cannot be run backwards in a meaningful way.

&gt; Any communication between them would have to travel the intervening distance instantaneously—that is, infinitely fast.

This is still very much under debate. To this point no one has designed an experiment sensitive enough to see if entangled communication breaks lightspeed in our reference frame. So, no, it's *not* the standard interpretation, it's just the better one because you don't have to be making shit up like time travel.

&gt; entanglement in time is identical to entanglement in space, and we have no qualms with information traveling in all directions across space

Wow, no it's not. Particles become entangled at *one time.* Their position in space is entirely fuzzy at the moment of entanglement - we only have a vague, probabilistic sense of where either of them could possibly be because of the rules of the wavefunction. There is a strong mathematical distinction between when a particle is and where.

&gt; “That’s one of the examples of a particle probing the future and seeing what’s there, and then making a decision based on it, and just not decaying,

AFAIK this has not been proven to violate relativity. It could just as easily happen below lightspeed.

&gt;  it joins a line of thought stretching to Plato and Aristotle. 

And there's a reason those two thinkers aren't taught in physics - because they just made stuff up."

If it takes all the particles in the universe to do that, then, fuck us. That's never gonna happen.


The problem with believing the universe is in a perpetual state of ""now"" is that you have the unrefined metaphysical processes of ""becoming"" and ""annihilation"", when the future ""becomes"" present and fades back away into nothingness of ""the past"". 

Also, special relativity would simply ask you: Who's ""now"" are you referring to? 

There is no objective way you can look at the timeline of our universe and label a point ""now"". It always represents the point in which you uttered the phrase ""now"", but that changes every time you say ""now"".

Without an objective ""now"", there is no meaningful way to distinguish between ""past"" and ""future"".

Sir_Dude,AskScienceFiction,1391179684.0,"I'm sorry, do you mean West Coast Dragons and East Coast Dragons?

There's a long and enthralling story about the feud between those draggas. 

Back in the ancient times know as the 1990's, the East Coast Dragons were getting fed up with these up and coming 'draggas' on the West Coast because some people thought that West Coast Dragons could breathe fire better.

This came to a head when an East Coast Dragon, called The Nefarious D.R.A.G won critical acclaim for a recent fire-breathing performance. A West Coast Dragon, originally born on the east coas, called Tuwing Flappur took serious offense to this after he had gotten shot five times in his fire-breathing recording studio and decided that The Nefarious D.R.A.G was behind it. In the lingo of the Fire-breathing dragon culture, ""shit was getting real, yo."" 

Over the next few years, East Coast Dragons and West Coast Dragons took jabs at each other in their fire-breathing performances. Each asserted their dominance and claimed that the others were ""low class draggas."" 

Events came to a head near the end of the era, when Tuwing Flappur was gunned down in a fly-by shooting in the skies above ancient Las Vegas. Many believed that his death was orchestrated by The Nefarious D.R.A.G. 

The Nefarious D.R.A.G denied these allegations, though he was not sorry about the demise of 2Wing. Several months later, The Nefarious D.R.A.G was shot dead in the sky above the ancient land of Los Angeles.

To this day, the deaths of Tuwing Flappur and The Nefarious D.R.A.G remain unsolved, their fire-breathing abilities have been remarked upon by many in the years since. 

That is why an East Coast Dragon would be fighting a West Coast Dragon. They are continuing an ancient feud over their fire-breathing ability. 

tl;dr: RIP Tuwing Flappur and The Nefarious D.R.A.G, we miss you, you fire-breathing draggas.

ChibiOne,asktransgender,1391179916.0,"&gt; Would it be accurate to describe myself as neurologically female, I just happen to have XY chromosomes?
I feel as if my brain is wired to have a female anatomy, and the dissonance between what I mentally expect and physically see causes me a ton of anguish.

This is my current belief.  There are several studies that show developmental differences between the structures of male and female brains, and transsexual persons to have brains structured more similarly to those of their identified gender.

&gt; Almost like phantom limb syndrome, I can't help but insist that I should have breasts, curves, and a vagina. Does anyone else feel like this?

For me personally, that is exactly how I felt.  But dysphoria is different for different people, so it is not necessarily a ""requirement"" to feel that way to be transgender.

&gt; I also see it as my mind functioning better with estrogen compared to testosterone. I'm no longer plagued by depression and panic attacks.

Ditto.

&gt; I have heard of a study showing that a small part of the brain might determine gender identity, has this experiment been reproduced?&gt;

Similarly, a few years ago I tried going vegetarian for a year. 1- I wanted to see if I COULD (I'm weird that way), and 2- I'd read a lot about how people felt physically/emotionally better after they stopped eating meat, and I wanted to see if that was true. Awesome learning experience. It wasn't hard at all! I stopped having any kind of meat cravings less than a month into it. Two months, and my brain stopped processing meat as an edible thing. I finished out the year fine, but to this day I still don't crave red meat anymore. Maybe a hamburger once very month and a half at most? Pretty cool how that worked. Saves a lot of money on grocery shopping XD

Guess he doesn't grasp how a DoF situation actually works, DoF gets the players in and the coach makes it work.  The idea is that you take the pressure off the coach in terms of personnel scouting/recruitment so they can focus on the squad.  Feedback goes to the DoF but ultimately the DoF makes the decision on who comes and goes not the manager.

Anniebanannimock2,TrollXChromosomes,1391180954.0,"Exactly!

I'm a hairdresser by trade but most of my life I've had some version of short hair. Honestly, I just look better with shorter hair because for some reason long hair makes me look frumpy and uninteresting.

When I was still dating I made a strong point to let guys know that if they wanted someone that had long hair that would never change, that they probably need to move on because as a human and a stylist, I was going to do whatever the hell I wanted with my hair. 

I'm almost embarrassed to say this, but if a guy who was dating me and had met me with shorter hair complained that they wanted me to grow it long, then I would promptly go cut it shorter just to be spiteful. Otherwise, I've pretty much been a loving, easy going and good girlfriend.

Luckily, I married a man that just wants me to be happy with my hair and who isn't afraid of changes. He's seen me through so many style and color changes and has joked that it's like he's always got a girlfriend."

You might be better off looking up research articles that poll women's responses when shown a variety of facial features, body types, you name it. Look at what kind of women they are polling, the number of women they poll, and what kind of responses they are getting. You could even look into studies that rely on the body's natural responses when sexually stimulated, what kind of features do those men have?

Chances are if thousands of women (in the demographic you are interested in) are polled and a large percent like a certain feature, it can be applied to a larger number in the same demographic. Soooooo, 85% of 5000 25/f/caucasian/christian women find a strong jaw attractive. You can then 'assume' that same percentage applies to the other 100000 women in that demographic.

Who's to say she was definitely lying about that?

I don't think Pack Rat is the biggest problem in the mono-B matchup, because it's going to be a while before they can make their rats big enough to tangle with your fatties.  Your mileage may vary.  Pithing Needle is also a reasonable card to board in against mono-B, because you can shut down either Pack Rat or Underworld Connections with it.

* I do like Spear over Ajani.  Ajani is a great finisher, but he's a bit more fragile and you're prone to getting blown out by spot removal after you use him to jump a creature.  Spear is also better on an awkward draw, because you can't very well throw Ajani onto a weak or empty board.

She sat in my hand a lot, either because I didn't have GGWW, or because I wanted to spend that mana casting Wurms and Scions to win the game rather than playing Trostani to stabilize the board.

slavik262,explainlikeimfive,1391181504.0,"It's about different design goals. CPUs are designed to execute a bunch of instructions really fast _in order_, whereas GPUs are designed to execute a bunch of instructions _in parallel_.

All computer programs, at the lowest level, break down into a fairly simple list of instructions. Load this value from RAM, add this, store the result here, etc. Because of this, your CPU has a few cores that are designed to execute a list of instructions very fast. Sure, you might jump around in the list due to conditionals (if... else... statements), and that can cause some interesting stuff to happen that I won't delve into here (pipeline flushes, instruction cache misses, etc.), but most of the time your processor is just crunching through a list, one by one.

Rendering computer graphics is a completely different problem. When drawing a frame for a 3D animation or a video game, you want to draw thousands of pixels as quickly as possible. In order to do this quickly, graphics cards have hundreds of cores. They may not individually be able to execute instructions as fast as your CPU, but they're really good at doing hundreds of things in parallel, e.g. drawing hundreds of pixels.

So, why are GPUs better than CPUs for cryptocurrency mining? To put things simply, mining is done by guessing a number that, when plugged into an equation (called a hash), results in a number that starts with a certain number of zeroes. It's basically computerized guesswork. If you can make hundreds of guesses at once with your GPU, you're going to be able to guess faster than you could with your CPU.

I hope this explains things better than the answer above, which unfortunately didn't do the best job IMO.

The Head Coach deals with the senior squad and the on the field performance and nothing else.

Chariman deals with the money

Ideally all of them are connected at the hip, but the idea is to take the work load off the manager so he can focus on the team. As the game becomes increasingly global it becomes a big ask for a manager to maintain a working knowledge of players around the world.  So the DoF along with the DoS deal with finding the players and recruiting them.  If they are young the Technical Director deals with the development.

The head coach gets input but is only one of several voices on the ultimate decision. Most times if a club utilizes a DoF the DoF can still bring players in if they deem it the right move.

Its becoming very common particularly on the continent with a great deal of success.  We keep getting rumored with LVG who has worked with a DoF everywhere he has been (including Bayern) as well as serving as a DoF himself.

The high priest of the order issued a punishment for failing to make it look like ""a group of bandits"" because after all the slaughter looked ""too brutal and the weapons were of the highest quality of steel and magic"" so for that my punishment was a sickness that caused horrible necrotic damage, and hallucinations. 

Playing law evil is pretty interesting, and it's fun taking out the ""Good guys"". Which were always ""adventurers"" as the DM put it.

Drabby,worldnews,1391182524.0,"&gt; Hang on, not really. She comes back in the morning to an open front &gt;door and bathroom with blood in it, proceeds to shower anyway

I'm not sure if you've ever lived in a house with menstruating women, but depending on the cleanliness of the woman there's sometimes blood in the sink.

&gt; then belatedly starts trying to find her flat mate when it becomes clear something is off. She makes two calls to Meredith's phone but doesn't seem to pursue it much further.

Pursue it further how? Other than by calling the police?

&gt; When police come over with Meredith's phone she claims that it isn't unusual for her bedroom door to be locked, although she'd already apparently started to become concerned about where Meredith was. The timings and actions are really odd.

By that time she had started to notice other signs of a break-in and had become worried.

&gt; There is evidence the three knew each other: witnesses saw them together.

Witness testimony was often vague and/or unreliable.

&gt; Guede was convicted on the understanding that he could not have acted alone. There are a lot of reasons for this. Just one: his footprints leading away from Meredith's locked door, which somebody else must have secured.

He left the room to poop in the toilet (his feces were found). He could easily have returned to the room afterwards.

&gt; Also the fact Meredith was clearly restrained.

There is debate about whether the restraint could have been done by the same person wielding the knife. The official autopsy verdict said no, other pathologists reviewing their report said yes.

&gt; Amanda was not harshly interrogated. There is no evidence for that whatsoever. She was questioned for at most two hours before he initial statement, with an interpreter, and that was when she was only being treated as a witness so didn't even legally require one. The case also never rested on charges of Satanism. That was a fabrication after the fact. The case in a nutshell is that Guede could not have acted alone and there are all kinds of evidence - circumstantial, DNA, contradictory and illogical alibis - suggesting Knox and Sollecito acted with him in some capacity.

On the other hand, no motive that makes any sense, no history of violence, and no conclusive forensic evidence that comes anywhere close to removing reasonable doubt."

The prosecution's experts admitted it on the stand, even though the prosecution kept referring to them as bloody footprints, especially in leaks to the media. They basically assumed that because there was a ton of blood in the murder room, and they were working under the assumption that Knox and Sollecito were guilty, then the footprints must have been blood even though they tested negative. It's madness. Complete circular argumentation, but the judge let it go. 

All the footprints and every other significant source of DNA found in the room belong to Guede or Meredith and nobody ever disagreed on that, though prosecution claimed Knox and Sollecito must have cleaned just their DNA,  an impossible feat, again because the prosecution had to put them in the room. The bra clasp didn't have a sufficient amount of DNA, had a significant chance of being contaminated by the time it was found due to shotty work by the police, and shouldn't have been admissible.

calzenn,conspiracy,1391183015.0," Sure, one can argue that this could save lives, stop some crime and such. But get real... its such a beautiful target, its going to be hacked.

Here are some scenarios that will happen when it is hacked:

* A trucking firm will be extorted for money or their trucks will be targeted. 
* Traffic will come to a standstill by hackers as a form of protest.
* Criminals will simply buy an older vehicle and then disable any police cars chasing them.
* It could easily be used to ambush vehicles on remote roads. Sort of modern ""highway man"" scenario.

Then you have the legal immobilization's:

* The technology probably will grow to make sure vehicles are immobilized for being parked an extra minute at parking meters until the fine is paid...
* Probably if you owe anyone any money they will simply immobilize your vehicle by legal means. Overdue bills? You are not going anywhere...
* There may come a scenario where you get immobilized by not being authorized to be in certain areas, like protest areas, gated communities and such. Just in case...
* One could also see the mass immobilization of vehicles in an area after any crime, until the police sweep, search and clear each and every vehicle. Was there a break-in a few blocks away? You can wait for a couple of hours until you are cleared...
* You might get immobilized just for running a bit of a red light, no cameras anymore, just a quick immobilization until the police clear you.

 This is a dangerous path to tread."

But if you were being serious, me switching to the wind product ensures that the portion of electricity I use came from a wind turbine built after 1999 (and specifically, most likely a wind farm in the state).  Not that the actual electrons came from the wind farm (because that's impossible to tell once the power is fed into the grid), but that AEP committed to buying that much electricity from the wind farm.  It also shows support for renewable power, both to AEP and the country as a whole.

I have my roommates wake me up in the morning so I HAVE to get out of bed. I think about the coffee in my kitchen (that's a main motivator).

notdeadanymore,sex,1391183366.0,"You mention loving with your mind and your heart, that you see physical acts as a way to express that love.

That is a huge part of the issue for many couples - we all express love differently, and we all feel our partner's love for different reasons. I don't know if you've heard of the Five Love Languages, but they are worth a look. Mine are words of affirmation (compliments, thank yous, I love yous) and physical affection (kissing, cuddling, hand holding, massages, sex). On days when we can't have sex for whatever reason, he makes sure he is physically affectionate with me in other ways, or that he lets me know how much he appreciates me through words. He makes sure that I feel loved by him every day.

Sex becomes such an issue in relationships because it leaves one or both partners feeling unloved, undesired or unappreciated. For instance, quality time might be one of your love languages - just a guess from the fact that you love talking to your girlfriend all day. If that is the case, imagine if your girlfriend said, ""Hey, I'm sick of talking to you all the time. I'd rather be out with my friends. How about we talk for two hours every second Sunday?"" Can you see that you might be hurt by this? 

It's the same way for many people with sex. If my boyfriend told me that he'd be fine if our relationship became celibate, because he loves me anyway, I'd be devastated. Because I want sex to be important to him like it's important to me - I need it to matter. 

You are right, of course, that people are different, and as long as you and your girlfriend are on the same page, then you're all set."

CrazyPlato,changemyview,1391183421.0,"Okay, here's where things get tricky. First off, as you mention, there's the issue of overseas travel. Your proposal would be pretty frustrating to the families with children who are now banned from visiting their relatives in Hawaii or Alaska, or perhaps people with foreign relatives overseas. Since boat travel isn't really a big thing anymore (and would take months anyway), that's a pretty serious gap in the idea.

Then there's the similar matter of time difference. A plane trip that would take hours could take several days if traveling by car, and cost a lot more in gas, food, hotels, etc. That's a pretty big cost to levy on families in the name of comfort. And when you spread it around to a general group (in this case, parents with young children), it almost sounds discriminatory (some children don't have problems with flying, so there is some prejudice present in the argument)."

That shit goes both ways. Only a loser would expect that. Most of my partners and I seduce each other pretty much equally...same moves, same games, same general behavior.

My girls do this stuff:

* Send me a text at work saying how much they wish I was there, sometimes to do ____ to them, even though they know I can't come see them!

* Send me texts saying how much they liked it when I did ____ to them last night and how they can't wait for me to do it again (general sexting)

* Send me texts telling me they are wearing my favorite _____, and then they just won't respond.

* Sit on my lap and encourage my full attention.

* While we are out in public they'll pull my hands down near their crotch or ass and bite their lip and smile (or more extreme).

* They generally tease me, which I fucking love.

* They'll wear certain items that I like or do other things that they know I like, and they'll make sure that I know that they know.

* They'll flirt with me like we aren't dating (especially in front of people).

* They'll initiate sex, whether it be in public, in the car, on the couch, or in bed.

Basically, it's the little subtle stuff that does it. A healthy, spicy, fun relationship requires action from both parties. Whatever he does to you, try it on him. If he wants you to do something that doesn't especially arouse you, try it anyway and expect him to return the favor.

I was a phone support agent for about 5 years before getting this position, but it was ""lateral"" and is still an entry-level position. That being said, I LOVE this job, especially compared to being on the phone with customers.

I take calls from techs who are at customers' homes and help them with support... (ie. This cable box I installed isn't working, they have the wrong rates/package on their account/they want to change what they're getting installed/etc)

I also so what's called ""routing"" basically when our people schedule an appointment for a tech to come to your home, they put it into a ""pool"" of appointments all in the same timeframe. I take this pool of appointments and assign them to the actual technicians. It's basically a puzzle to put together getting the technicians routes where they are not driving too much between jobs, and making sure they will be able to make all their appointments on time. This requires that I work EARLY (4am-1230pm). 

I really love the routing part, I love solving puzzles, and it's always ""different"" and you have to piece it together. WHile there are tools we use to help a lot, it still takes some work (the area I route has anywhere from 50-70 technicians depending on the day, and usually anywhere from 160-300 jobs - this usually takes me around an hour and a half to assign these all out)

I do have a degree but it's in Criminal Justice (it's what I had the most credits in when I decided to finally finish my degree) and while that degree is in a completely different field, I'm quite happy where I am and really only plan to move into that field when I find something that I really want to work, not just because I have the degree..."

K2TheM,motorcycles,1391183931.0,"Adding resistors to LED signals kinda defeats half the purpose of LED's. Resistors will only solve the ""fast flash"" issue when going to LED signals. The other way to solve the fast flash issue is to change the signal relay over to an electric one, which it sounds like the PO might have done.

IIRC the 83 Nighthawk has a running light circuit. This means that the signals had three wires. One for constant on, one for the flash, and one for ground. Most LED turn signals only have two wires. One for ""on"" and one for ground. You can run them just fine without using them as running lights, just be sure to wire them to the correct circuit."

The answer is nothing.

You claim to have raided to destroy them and establish your dominance.  That's clearly a lie given that you know they're admins and that they spawn items in.  You know they'll just spawn in more items.

The other reason I know you lied is because you ""took every piece of gear in the house.""  You raided to enrich yourselves.  This isn't some crusade, it's typical Rust banditry.  You have absolutely no need for that many M4's, and you both put yourselves at risk by carrying out a bunch of useless junk.  It was neither necessary nor intelligent.

This is all compounded by the fact that you could have simply thrown all excess materials on the ground and then destroyed everything in the base.  I'm not saying you should have.  I would have.

Zagaroth,Steam,1391184480.0,"Actually, he's right. 

The only thing that matters is how many guesses you have to make. Dictionary attacks guess random words from the dictionary. This is then enhanced with prioritizing commonly used words (Monkey) and with variations (like trying @ for A and 0 for o and random capitalization).

Including obsolete words, the oxford dictionary lists a little over 200,000 words. That's 200,000 guesses, multiplied by variations that goes up a lot, not sure how much but lets be generous and say that if you have really weird randomization of your words and append a single number you are at 100,000,000 possible passwords.

BUT, when you use 4 random words, You have now multiplied that attack space by a incredible amount.

At 2 words you immediately jump to 40,000,000,000 possible combinations. As these are random words, you have to guess. Password attacks are all about reducing the number of attacks you need, 2 totally random words eliminates the ability to guess common word usage.

At three words you have 8,000,000,000,000,000 possible guesses.

At 4 words, you have 1,600,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible passwords.

with four random words, sure you have to use a dictionary to reduce your guesses purely to words , rather than random characters, but your attack space is still HUGE compared to a smaller password using random characters. and that's before you throw any random crap into it, or add random characters between words, etc.

and 8 character password, using numbers and capitalization, has an attack space of 218,340,105,584,896. If it contains random characters including all the symbols on a standard keyboard, your attack space is 5,132,188,731,375,616

Now, at 20 characters, the random characters becomes insane:

Capitals and numbers: 2.0896178655943101411324274803737e+34
+ Symbols: 1.8869332916279655363958709517379e+39

So without bothering to take the time to figure everything out specifically, *UNADULTERATED* random 4 words is vastly better than a gibberish 8 character password, and way worse than a 20 character gibberish password.

BUT, you can then adulterate the 4 words with a small set of changes, multiplying its strength because even though simple changes can be guessed with a combined dictionary attack, it has to make ALL the variations (if your four words have 3 ""A""s between them (maybe you did all of them as Caps, all of them as @, all of them lowercase, one of each, two of one one of the other, etc). And it has to try ALL the variations for ALL the words. 

This pushes the number of guesses needed towards the 20 characters of gibberish level, and leaves the password rememberable, so you don't have to write it down or trust a program to keep it for you.

Also note that they have to know you are using a 4 word pass phrase. There's no feedback informing an attacker of this. So unless you advertise it, they are going to start with a normal combined dictionary attack. When that's exhausted (because again, it's not like the movies. having a portion of the answer correct, ie guessing one of the words, gives 0 feedback, so you don't know you got one of the words right) they'll have to guess if you are using a passphrase or random characters and choose a scenario.

After all, they don't even know how long your password is. so using a passphrase will push the guessability of your password out of the range of any one except maybe the NSA. 

All you need is to push your password beyond the range of time your attacker is willing to put into the attack. The more guesses needed the longer its going to take. With enough time and resources, any password can eventually be breached, but I am not sure a single attacker is going to dedicate 20 years to trying to hack your steam account.

Passphrases are 'good enough', AND memorable. "

I would try to find a job--- that way you are out of the house, you are productive, and you interact with people at work, and you can start saving up to move out. 

I recommend reading and writing-- those were the things that saved me. I read a lot of things like Clockwork Orange, Alice in Wonderland, Catcher in the Rye, etc. when I was your age. Literature is where it's at-- even if you don't bother talking to people, reading books is like you're in a conversation with people, and if you read the right books, the author understands what you're going through.

And write! Get it all out. For years I've kept notebooks somewhere between journals and poetry, and when I was in a really bad place I would burn the pages or throw them away, but writing does help."

Religion comes up so rarely it barely worth thinking about...at least if you are normal.  And I presume you 2 are since you are still together after 6 months.

My wife is Christian.  When we started dating we broke up 2 or 3 times all over religion.  It wasn't that we had a problem...she had family and friend telling her she should date a nice christian boy.  That way she could grow in her faith with him.  Thankfully my sister in law talked to her and convinced her that ""God"" does not make mistakes.  We were ment to be in each others lives for a reason...bla bla bla...and we have been solid ever since.

We learned comprimise.  The only time I go to church with her is on Christmas Eve.  She goes to church on Sunday Mornings and I get to enjoy sleeping in...when kids come around they will go with her until they choose to stop.

In your case with just dating offer to go to church with her every once and a while.  It shows you are okay with her faith, earns you brownie points, and help you get used to it...since if you seriously want to continue this relationship you will be required to go a few times a year.  And really...we all end up doing somethings we don't want to do in order to make our spouses/partners happy...think of going to church like that.

Since you have been together for 6 months she seems not to be one of the crazy ones.  Hopefully her family won't have to many issues with you.  My in-laws took over a year to warm up to me...once they started to get to know me it was smooth sailing.

If we believe the world is a certain way, it will always be a delusion, because our idea of what the world is like, is merely an abstract concept, and by its own nature, could never be representative of its container (life itself). Life is too vast and too complicated, and even if you think you can be sure that a majority of some things are a certain way, that's still usually a long way away from all of the things being that way.

Since we are so terrible at realizing how life is, I think its a good idea to know the scientific method, and to rely on scientific understanding in matters that require knowledge, and use our intuition in situations that require wisdom.

duggtodeath,offbeat,1391184843.0,"&gt; Yes I am aware of that legal opinion. As soon as I typed the words ""limited,"" I was expecting you to drop that one. So good job taking that bait - hook, line and sinker. You are amusingly predictable.

I didn't know this was some competition, nor do I see how this supports your point, but okay....

&gt; I've gotta hand it to you - if you devoted the amount of time and effort you do to challenging the claims of rights infringed by others instead rather to the defense of your own rights -you might turn yourself into a citizen worthy of respect.

I am on your side, and like I said before, I did not see any evidence that anyone fundamental rights had been taken away. If anything, the DC Heller case proved that there was a long-standing judgement already in place and it got bought up again for deliberation and review. That is because it was part of a longer, larger discussion involving the DC area. Pulling that case out of its context to make a larger point is dishonest and imprecise. It is ham-fisted to just say that rights were taken away when that just isn't the case. Just because someone did not get their way does not mean that the rights of other citizens are harmed. For example, I am sure you are not a defenseless person. You can still defend yourself, so what have you lost?

&gt; It's almost as if some compulsion you must respond to each of my comments. It's like some sort of power I exert over you. A power that I don't want at all, and I find its exercise thereof slightly irritating.

I could say the same for you. Neither of us have to stay in the conversation. Getting in the last word is not a victory in my case. I only wish for you to walk away with a better sense of how to build a rational argument rather than boiling down unrelated incidents into oversimplified examples of a larger goal to harm American rights.

&gt; So are you done being really bothered by the exercise of my rights? Or do you have another line by line breakdown of my comments for me to roll my eyes at? Come now, you've made it so far now, don't give up now my dear friend!

This just makes it easy for me to respond without confusion. Like I have said before, you need to give up this idea that of turning the world black and white. America is not US vs THEM. I want you to have your rights, but you cannot assume that my criticism of your frustration is somehow against your rights. That's not how a country works. You are instead asking to choose a hard side because tat is what worked for you. I cannot without looking at all my options and the evidence presented. You've instead decided on a side and then cherry-picked evidence to support your decision. That is backwards and maybe an example of a sunk-cost fallacy. I really hope you are around more people who can challenge our ideas. I am not saying I am right, but if I never even entertain arguments from a critic, then I am doing a disservice to myself and my country.

&gt; Tell me another of your stories how our collective rights aren't being continually and unceasingly whittled away with each legislative session! Tell me more!

Again, the burden of proof is on you, not me. You made the claim, you have to back it up with evidence. You previously gave me some incidents around the country and I showed you with my evidence that you either got them wrong or misunderstood the core issues. You had a chance to then give me more evidence to show I got it all wrong. Instead, you picked some cases and I demonstrated you did not fully understand them. I think you never read these cases or incidents and instead picked out the parts you disagreed with in order to confirm a prior-held bias. I am willing to accept your argument, but the evidence you supplied has been refuted. I am also perfectly willing to allow an unbiased independent arbitrator to check both your supplied evidence and my refutations. You don't have to take my word for it, and I would like the chance to strengthen my own arguments if I was proven wrong."

I actually literally just had exactly this conversation with a girl on campus, and it went swimmingly. Conversation was initiated when I bumped into someone else and she made a comment about how it's so hard to not get in people's way, and I said ""I feel like I'm in Canada, we both said 'sorry'."", and from there we went through the standard: What Year are you in, what's your major, then I asked for her name, what do you want to do with your life, we talked about what we'd done the night before, and all of those topics spawned side conversations about our friends and stuff. I asked her where she was headed; she said she was done with classes for the day.

Under ordinary circumstances I that would have been a great time to either ask if she wanted to get lunch, or say ""Hey, I've got to go this way but do you want to get lunch some time?"", after which if she was interested, and I'm pretty sure she was, she probably would have given me her phone number.

But I had literally just texted a completely different girl 10 minutes ago to ask if she wanted to get lunch and I felt like it would have been insincere to do that. The girl I texted said she has no gap between work and school today, so I kind of wish I had now, but the point is that totally would have been an appropriate moment to ask, and that's how I got there."

Congratulations on the decision to quit. Your first day without cigarettes can be difficult, but having a plan will make it easier! Don't rely on willpower alone to keep you smokefree. Prepare so that you can feel confident in your ability to stay quit today.
Step One
Tell your friends and family that today is your quit day. Ask them for support during these first few days and weeks. They can help you get through the rough spots, but make sure to tell them how they can support you. Be specific; they aren't mind readers.
Step Two
Get the support you need—either by developing your own quit plan or finding a quit program that works for you. A quit plan combines strategies that help you stay focused, confident, and motivated to quit. You might decide to use a quit program like SmokefreeTXT, or a quitline like 1–800–QUIT–NOW (1–800–784–8669), to get started. If you're not sure exactly which quit methods are right for you, visit the Quit Smoking Methods Explorer to learn more. If nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is part of your plan, make sure to start using it first thing in the morning. Remember, there's no right way to quit—be honest about what you need. Just don't celebrate with a cigarette.
Step Three
Stay busy. It might seem simple, but staying busy is one of the best ways to stay smokefree on your quit day. Try one of these activities:
Get out of the house
Go to dinner at your favorite smokefree restaurant
Go to a movie
Chew gum or hard candy
Keep your hands busy with a pen or toothpick
Relax with deep breathing
Plan a game night with non-smoking friends
Change your regular routine
Drink a lot of water
Exercise

Step Four
Avoid smoking triggers. Triggers are the people, places, things, and situations that trigger your urge to smoke. On your quit day, it's best to avoid them all together. Here are a few tips to help you outsmart some common smoking triggers:
Throw away your cigarettes, lighters, and ash trays if you haven't already
Avoid caffeine, which can make you feel jittery; try drinking water instead
Hang out with non-smokers; most people don't smoke, so you should have options
Go to a place where smoking isn't allowed; unless you want to break the law, you won't light up
Get plenty of rest and eat healthy; lack of sleep and too much sugar can trigger you to smoke

Step Five
Stay positive, but vigilant. Quitting smoking happens one minute, one hour, and one day at a time. Don't think of quitting as ""forever"". Pay attention to right now, and the days will add up! Quitting smoking is difficult, but it doesn't hurt to say positive; don't beat yourself up. Day one isn't going to be perfect, but all that matters is you don't smoke—not even one puff. Reward yourself for being smokefree for 24 hours. You deserve it!
If you're not feeling prepared to quit today, set a quit date that makes sense for you. It's okay if you need a few more days to prepare to quit smoking."

Tokyocheesesteak,todayilearned,1391185807.0,"Columbus was a savage, but many otherwise important historical figures have rotten sides as well. America's first President used to own people (and was the only slave owner in Pennsylvania due to a legal loophole). Churchill convinced America to overthrow Iran's democratically elected President and install a puppet dictator in his place. Woodrow Wilson was vocal about his support for the Ku Klux Klan. The guy that ultimately defeated Nazi Germany also exterminated millions of his own countrymen in labor camps. Nelson Mandela strongly believed in violence and terrorism to achieve his goals in his youth. Franklin Delano Roosevelt decided to send Americans to camps based on their ethnicity (Japanese).

More often than not (though not always), school curricula tend to ignore this duplicitous nature of prominent figures. They would rather separate them into two distinct categories: chiseled Greek gods without a blemish vs irredeemable bloodthirsty villains. Perhaps more children would relate to history more if textbooks placed more emphasis on presenting prominent people as what they are: mere humans, capable of great good and great evil, each to a different degree. Maybe then they would start seeing it as stories of men capable of great successes and great fuck-ups, rather than mythologies about perfect, boring, unrealistic demigods."

Anjeer,community,1391185815.0,"Here is the plot: 

Act I: Normal Community stuff. Abed has been given a job teaching film classes, but becomes increasingly erratic because he is worried about Troy being abducted by pirates. He tries to get the gang involved, but because Troy has been sending stuff back from his adventures, they really aren't that worried. 

Troy sends a painting of a duck, but the bill seems to be very badly done. Abed believes this to be a cry for help and begins decoding the painting, realizing that Troy is in a lit of trouble. 

Brent Spiner shows up to Greendale because he has run out of leads in trying to find LeVar Burton, since he hasn't heard anything from him in months. 

Abed and Spiner take off as detectives to try to rescue Troy and LeVar. 

Act II: The Dean begins losing it because of Abed's disappearance. He rounds up Jeff, Britta, Annie and Shirley.

Everyone is actually worried about Abed now, so they start investigating. Chang drops hints about a secret lair called ""the Pit"" hidden at Greendale, where they could discover what Abed has been up to. 

They discover a secret room under the stage (The long forgotten orchestral pit.) In the Pit, they discover a series of absurd puzzles to uncover the basis of Pierce Hawthorne's ""power and influence"" at Greendale. After working hard to unravel a last puzzle, one involving the canisters of Pierce's frozen sperm, a hologram of Pierce appears to give them what seems like sage advice, but is ultimately useless. 

The gang, heartbroken and angry, heads out when Shirley sees a computer with the video game from the episode ""Digital Estate Planning."" Abed's digital wife (who has gained sentience) tells Shirley where he is since she has a direct line to Abed. 

Shirley tries to get in contact with Abed, but the digital wife gets jealous and flips out, telling Abed what happened. 

Camera change to Abed and Brent Spiner on a speedboat, going full power. Abed receives a call from his digital wife, letting him know the gang is coming. 

Act III: The Dean is trying to stop Jeff from leaving. Jeff has been teaching a summer class and would be leaving in the middle of the semester. Begin super heated argument where the Dean tries his hardest to stop Jeff from leaving. Awful argument and fighting ensues. 

Jeff storms out of the Dean's office, seemingly defeated. Rita (the secretary) gives a heartfelt speech essentially saying ""damn this place, go save your friends.""

Unknown to everyone, Chang has been listening and takes it upon himself to prepare for battle. 

Cut to Annie driving a boat with Jeff, Shirley, and Britta. They are approaching the pirate base where Troy and LeVar are supposed to be. They set up camp near the base, but are taken by surprise by Abed and Spiner, who are decked out in full spy gear. After some confusion, Abed lays out his plan to rescue Troy, letting the gang in on helping. 

They all sneak into the pirate base, only to be caught when Britta accidentally sets off a bunch of fireworks. 

They are brought to a prison cell, where Troy and LeVar are held. Jeff gives a super sappy speech about how they tried to help, but at least they're all together again. 

After this heartfelt moment, noises outside make it quite clear that there is a fight going on. A jetski flies past the window and crashes into a nearby building. The guards outside the cells drop and cover their faces, red paint blinding them. 

It's Chang to the rescue! He beaks them out, saying that they were hard to find, but he did it. He gets them safely to the beach where the gang sees a bunch of naval boats waiting while the military storms the pirate base. 

Chang tells them that this is where they part ways and he has to run or else he will be arrested for violating his probation. The gang is found by the military and brought back after their rescue.

Ah, yes, the ""man up"" approach.  Y'know, I tried that when I was suicidally depressed in my teenage years.  Strangely enough, it didn't work, and it instead destroyed 10 years of my life through all the mental damage I did trying to tell myself ""I'm intelligent, I should be able to fix this myself"", ""Other people have it so much worse than you do; you've got no right to feel as bad as you do"", etc.  Meanwhile, in tandem the anxiety became so bad I couldn't even do things like call to order a pizza.

Turns out ""manning up"" doesn't work so well when you've got a chemical imbalance in your brain.  Who knew?

I don't know if you're just a troll or yet another ignorant person that is doing nothing but adding to the stigma of mental health problems in this country, but it's time you took a damn hard look at the reality of depression.  Attitudes like yours kill."

If you aren't ever exposed to something, you won't understand it, or even know it exists so you can't ever enjoy it or become accustomed to it. I've never played cricket.

zegafregaomega,AskGames,1391186141.0,"It doesn't get much more legendary than *Ico* and *Shadow of the Colossus* for the PS2. If nothing else, I highly recommend playing those two games.

There are also modern classics like the *Ratchet and Clank* series and the *Jak and Daxter* games, both of which are action-platformers with a strong emphasis on humor.

The *Metal Gear Solid* series was a flagship series on the PS1 and PS2 and comes very highly recommended. MGS 1 was made for PS1, and 2 and 3 were made for the PS2. I recommend playing them in order, and for the love of god, if you buy MGS 3 make sure, make absolutely positively sure you buy the SUBSISTENCE version of the game. The original MGS 3: Snake Eater has a classic, fixed-point camera that ruins the game for a lot of people, whereas the Subsistence version has a 3D camera you would expect from a PS2 game. The camera in the Snake Eater version is so frustrating, it's considered by many fans to be the worst mistake Hideo Kojima (the game's director) has made in his career. Also, don't get it confused with MGS 2 Substance. Subsistence and Substance are two different updates for 2 different games. If you can get MGS 2: Substance, that's cool, but you're not losing a whole lot if you go with the original.

/u/KronnHunter's list is really good, but keep in mind playing the Final Fantasy Anthology/Chronicles is a dampened experience compared to playing them on the SNES because of long load times. I've seen Chrono Trigger called one of the worst ports in all of video games because of a 3-4 second delay between changing areas, and more importantly, going in and out of the character menu, both of which you'll end up doing fairly often. If you don't own an SNES, I recommend emulating or looking around for the Chrono Trigger port to the Nintendo DS. CT is a must-play and it still holds up after nearly 20 years."

gazork_chumble_spuzz,BodyAcceptance,1391186755.0,"&gt;Well, I have been talking my therapist (who, unfortunately for me, will be going on maternity leave soon). She suggested that I find a therapist that specializes in body image issues

She's right. You sound like you would really benefit from someone with experience in this area.

&gt; I explained that I want to loose about 25 pounds to keep my SO happy and fulfilled

Are you sure that's why? Because it sounds to me like your boyfriend isn't the real reason you want to be thinner. He was concerned and shocked when he saw the woman you feel you look most like, because you don't look like her at all - his reaction seems to indicate that he sees you very differently than you see yourself...he sees you as a healthy weight. I think you want to lose weight because you see yourself as being unhealthy and/or fat...that's what it seems like, anyway.

I think you should get a recommendation from your current therapist and see someone who knows how to help people struggling with body image issues. As well, I think you should forget about losing weight or getting thin, and instead, take up a hobby that will make you *strong*. Something challenging. Because nothing will make you appreciate your body like teaching it how to do hard things that require physical strength. Weightlifting is a good place to start. Running's great. Dancing is awesome too (I recommend belly dance! it doesn't matter how curvy or thin you are, you can do it and be gorgeous). Learn to change the way you think about these things: you aren't eating well and exercising because your body is bad and you want to change it, you're eating well because your body is *good* and it deserves to be nourished and cared for. If you can learn to see these things as positive and as a reward for your body rather than a way to whip it into shape or make it better, it really helps. Stay away from the thinspo stuff - it's pretty toxic.

&gt;I just want to be thinner and happier with my body but it kind of seems impossible and almost like I don't deserve to be pretty.

Another key is learning to be happy with your body *now*. If you don't think you're good enough now, as you are, you probably won't think you're good enough if you lose he weight you want to lose. This is something I've had to learn over the last few years. I have been underweight for years, and after having children I was finally a good, healthy weight - at 5'8"", I went from 117 lbs on my wedding day to around 150 lbs six years later. I stayed there until 2012, and then I got sick. Lost 7 lbs in one week and never regained it. Then we moved, and in all the stress I lost more weight. I'm currently hovering around 130. I missed the curves for months - I missed having more padding on my torso and breasts, missed having more voluptuous thighs. But I learned that being 130 lbs is okay too. I will never have an hourglass figure and big boobs. But that doesn't mean my body is wrong the way it is. Being lean and kinda bony is beautiful too. Weird, isn't it, how everyone seems to want what they don't have? that anyone would be really thin and *not* want to be that way? But I didn't. And I had to learn how to think differently about my body, how to accept that being really slim like this is apparently my body's default setting, and that I will never look like one of those sexy pin-up girls with round hips and a fluffy chest. Learning to realize that it's okay - I don't have to look like that to feel comfortable in my own skin. It took a lot of time but I got there. You can, too...and if you need help to learn how, that's okay too! There's no shame in it. It's something you do minute by minute if you must - every time you look in the mirror and pick out your flaws, you stop and tell yourself - out loud, if you must - that your body is great as it is, that you are beautiful, and that the way you look is not a flaw or a problem to be fixed. Because it's not! Even if you actually *were* overweight (and you aren't - you are a healthy size for your height!), it STILL wouldn't be a flaw and your body STILL wouldn't be bad or wrong.

As for not deserving to be pretty, hun, I think you'd find many people in your life who would tell you that *you already are pretty*, especially your boyfriend...pretty isn't something that only thin people ""deserve"", and it isn't something that only thin people can be. Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. And frankly, I think that feeling beautiful is a woman's birthright. I think it's something we all deserve to feel. You deserve to feel and to be pretty as much as the most beautiful women you see. You don't have to hide your body in shame and feel unworthy, because you aren't.

Think about the whole restaurant deal. 

It is theatre all the way. Waiters, the process of selecting what to get from the kitchen, the ridiculous ceremony over pulling a cork and sniffing it before trying a tiny sip for taste before pouring it. (Back before Louis Pasteur figured out how to prevent wine from going off in the bottle, you just never knew how it would come out - so to speak)

So if you are gonna pay to be treated like some dutchess, why not start out from home in the same manner. Dress for dinner, and stuff like that.

Think of it as extended foreplay.

To me, treating women with preference is the habit of a lifetime, like knowing what fork to use, and stuff like that.

imnotminkus,Frugal,1391187217.0,"Road trip.  Find a chunk of nearby cities you want to visit and plan it out with Google Maps and a Google Doc while looking at Tripadvisor and other similar sites.

For lodging, camp if that's your thing, or airbnb.  My trick is to stay in Choice Hotels during the summer (sleep inn, quality inn, econolodge, etc.).  

The past few summers, they've had a deal for their loyalty program where you get enough points for a $50 gift card (choice of several gas stations and some other stores) with every two stays, and you can earn an unlimited amount.  The catch is that a ""stay"" is one night in their more expensive hotels (sleep inn, quality inn, etc.) and two nights in the cheaper ones.  You also have to change hotels in order to make it a separate ""stay"" (i.e., 2 separately-booked nights in the same hotel on Friday and Saturday night only count as one ""stay"").  Since Choice Hotels has 11 brands, there are plenty of hotels in most cities to move around to (eg. Nashville has ~30 within 15 miles).  You can also combine this with the AAA rate (usually $5-$10/night less) and they don't check your membership card when you book online - you just have to book it with a valid number.  Then, look at prices/distances and plan ""stays"" accordingly, while checking tripadvisor to be sure the hotel isn't a disaster (I've only had one that was unclean).  It usually ends up being cheapest to stay at the least expensive of the group of non-econo lodge or rodeway inn hotels.  After the rewards, I've paid as little as $25/night and an average of $33/night after taxes and fees.  You can also look at it as paying for your gas on the trip."

Uh, no it's not, we've done it here on earth.  If it's been done on earth the only thing stopping it from happening on the moon is the astronomical cost.  We have the technology, everyone with the power to do so is too busy funnelling money into stealth fighters that aren't stealth and don't work.

Edit: it's amazing to me how many people think we can't terraform the moon...almost like none of you have actually read up on the plans for terraforming the moon.  It involves self contained habitats which will hold atmo and provide food (gmo's are a big help here) along with several other technologies to sustain life earth style (thus ""terraforming"" the moon).  So many of you seem hung up on the sci-fi idea of terraforming, not the reality of it.

The reality of it is what's known as ""planetary engineering"", which is the application of technology (habitats) to sustain life (plants and people) on a foreign planet.  Terraforming in the ""magically turn it all into earth"" sense only exists in Ender's Game and Firefly and stuff.  Planetary Engineering is the real terraforming (and was in fact chosen specifically because of the responses I keep getting, people thinking terraforming means you have to pop open a GECK and overwrite the planet) and it's what MoonBase Alpha (for example) draws from."

In my own university, the highest level maths that's used in chemistry classes is differentiation and understanding first/second derivatives, including chain rule and such; in one MChem level course we had to take determinants from 3x3 matrices, and that's the highest we've gone; Fourier transforms and most of quantum mechanics were always described in a hand-wavy way, group theory as used by *most* chemists at my institution doesn't even seem to warrant defining what a group is mathematically, and I'm personally stuck at a point where I have fairly decent maths skills (I did about 2 years more of it than I was supposed to) but materials science grad programmes don't want to take me because I'm a chemist and chemists don't know how to do line integrals; seriously, that's their reasoning and I actually get it because my degree did not include that level of mathematics.

- there ain't no Target or WalMart or whatever.
- shit closes for every, single Catholic holiday. And all Sundays, too.
- trying to rent an apt is expensive as hell, gotta put 3 months down (or more), and then there's nebenkosten...
- that apt likely will not have a ""proper"" American-style refrigerator, it'll be more like a dorm-style mini-fridge.
- that means you'll have to do grocery shopping a bit differently, so expect to spend more time going to the store &amp; shit, on average.

So sure, there's good beer, the people are great, ther'es no shortage of pretty ladies, and there's tons of great restaurants &amp; food... but all in all, it's a tough existence.

You know you'll be seven months along at that point, right? All that standing is going to be bad for the baby, we'd better host it for you."", etc. On top of that, there are the people who say you need to gain more weight, that you've gained too much weight, or that the weight you've gained is settling poorly. Then there's people just coming up to you in the street and touching your belly, like they know you or something.

Anyway, the point is, these women have had it up to their noses with hearing about what pregnant women are ""supposed"" to do, and I'm not surprised that even women who didn't drink during their pregnancy would get exasperated at reading that thread. "

Again like you said it comes down to personal preference but I do not see tacnet having any advantage over maptactic. Even going as far as saying it is worse because it shows the tank icon instead of the class icon. The class icon is more recognizable and it is easier to tell a class to go somewhere when they are all associated with the same icon.

I can say with utter confidence that I don't have an addictive personality in any shape or form.  I just do everything sometimes.  Lately VERY rarely, but… sometimes.  I know what I 'm doing, I know when to do what, and how much.  (If anyone's read Keith Richard's biography, you know why he has survived so long.  Pacing).  

I do ""look forward"" to drugs (mostly alcohol).  Having a kid can do that.  I've become honest with myself about how often pot is not always fun.  More interested in narrowing down the strains I like.  

But as much as I do like to ""feel different"", I still maintain that my favorite thing about drugs is not what it does to ME, it's what it does to other people.  

When other people are in party mode, they act like I (ENFP) wish people acted all the time. The confessional, instant intimacy of E.  The warmth and high spirits of a whisky bar. Chasing down conversational tangents with a stranger on coke.  The sheer inventiveness of ideas while stoned.  

Maybe it's all just another way to say lack of inhibitions.  Inhibitions I don't have, and wish others didn't either.  Drugs get them up to my speed.  That's more than half the reason I like them.

I had in 2012 hair down to my boobs but it's curly so it needed layers cut into it in order to not look like a hot mess which of course plays into the whole I hate getting my hair cut issue. Hence it began to look really sad-bad at the stage where it was boob length. I also was using so much product and conditioner that I could buy a new car each year out of what I spent on my stupid hair. Frustrated and kind of having a post-break-up Felicity moment I chopped it all off into a pixie.

I was told I looked TERRIBLE and like a boy and one guy I had begun seeing commented while drunk, ""your new hair won't be very popular here"" (with here being the city where I live). I once again didn't maintain it and the growing out period was horrid. Mullet kind of curly mop for months. I finally got a free haircut that involved layers b-u-t because I had such short hair the sides were really weak so I was told to wait for them to fill in before I got a new haircut. That was last spring.

I've had the urge-itch to shorten my hair because it's now shoulder length again. Mainly because I want to stop having to straighten it every single day but honestly as a curly girl having short hair means you need to constantly clip it whereas just having layers put in every 3ish months is easier. I think I just enjoy the no fuss, no muss of short hair because I'm so much into being a lazy cat :)"

ruat_caelum,learnprogramming,1391189678.0,"This is a great answer. at this point in your learning they are the same to you. I.e. you have a tool bag with many tools (the programming languages) but all you are using is a hammer and some nails (which both languages do well.)

C90, C99, c++, and c# (c - SHARP) all allow the programmer to do very powerful things with little checking. I.e. you can shoot yourself in the foot. Or more likely the liver.

Java is great with start-up costs. i.e. I want to learn to make a program in java, there is little (comparatively) to learn to make a program.

This is the difference between a stunt car (C++) and an automatic self-driving google car (java) The stunt car has a bunch of options, a level to shift drive power from the front wheels to the rear or any portion between. A manual transmission. Control of oxygen intake and back pressure. Compared to a car that lets you just point at a destination and go.

The java car and the C car both get you there but a nice easy drive in the java car is very very complicated in the C car. You need to know when to brake and shift etc, etc.

Now let's say you want to go off roading. You still have the same level of complication in the C car (different choices but the same level of complexity) the Java car simply can't do it (it can, but it was not designed for this.)

/u/Raiyni is correct though. Pick one and learn it. stick with it for a few years and the similarities will fall into place, as will the differences. Sometimes you will compile a portion of code in c and run that with java (this is often how drivers are written, i.e. hardware drivers for anything.)"

The things in her blood that the test is looking for that gives a positive result can come from more than one thing, like HIV and autoimmune diseases are the two main ones we use the test for. It's a screening test, which is looking for a specific antibody-antigen reaction that is known to be present in multiple disease states. The Western Blot is a confirmatory test, which means that any of the positive ELISA tests, after being run in duplicate, are run on the Western Blot. Based on the results of that test, you can distinguish between different disease states, like HIV versus an autoimmune disease.

And how the ELISA/Western Blot testing goes is:
run the first ELISA test, if positive result, run a second ELISA test, if second test is positive, send out for Western Blot. The second ELISA test rules out the possibility of a false positive, because the stats of the tests aren't added together, since they aren't the same test. It is two different ones. The other person that posted that it has a 0.1% is correct, but you don't add the possibility of the test giving that result back separately.

LizzieDane,AskWomen,1391189879.0,"&gt; Would you say that someone who looks at porn (with or without a specific fetish) but has never been personally/physically experienced sex does not ""sexually know themselves?""

Yep. You can watch porn 24/7 but it won't actually tell you what sex feels like - both the sensation and what it's like to interact with another person that way. You cannot know that without doing it. That's not to say you can't know if you do/don't like something, I know I don't like asparagus without trying it. But while you can safely assume you'd enjoy sex, you really cannot know much more than that. You can't say which positions feel best to you, if you prefer it hard, soft, fast, slow, whatever. You can say ""That looks fun,"" til you're blue in the face and not actually *know.*

&gt; What about someone who maybe has a physical disability, which leaves them unable to perform sexual intercourse or all types of sex. They still think about it, get turned on, have preferences, etc. Would this person not know themselves sexually either?

This person would not know how they like the acts they can't engage in to be done, no.

If you've never had oral, for example - you won't know outside of obvious things like ""don't bite my genitals off"" what exactly you enjoy when it comes to a mouth on your genitals. You can guess. It can even be a really good guess! But you don't ~know~, and that for me is a dealbreaker. I am not up for a journey of self discovery with someone unless I can walk away should those discoveries be unsavoury to me. To marry someone THEN work on finding out what they're into - nope.

I imagine that Vinatieri means a 50yd FG as calculated by today's stat-collectors, so that would mean that a FG kicked when the line of scrimmage is the 33yd line or worse should count for 4pts.

The idea is retarded, imagine this setup:

A team down by 4 at the end of a game, 3rd &amp; goal at the 8 yd line.

Today, that team would have 2 downs to get into the endzone.

In Vinatieri's world, the team would have to make one of two choices:

1) Traditional attempt to win by making two attempts at the end zone; or

2) QB runs backwards to the 33 yd line to set up a 50yd FG.

exitingcarisfail,relationships,1391190022.0,"Your logical about the percentages of testing false positive are wrong though. You don't add them together when you have a second test. The purpose of running the second ELISA test is to rule out the possibility of a false positive. As I posted before, the ELISA test is a screening test and does not tell you have a specific disease state, it just says that there is a specific antibody-antigen reaction that is present in specific disease states. The Western blot is a confirmatory test, which means that based on the results of that test, they will be able to tell what disease state is causing the specific antibody-antigen reaction. In this case the main two are autoimmune disease and HIV. There are many autoimmune diseases, one of which are chronic allergies. So the person that had the positive ELISA test every time and then negative Western Blot for HIV just means that she doesn't have HIV, but she still has the antibody-antigen reaction complex that they have flagged to be involved somehow in HIV. The negative Western Blot means that she doesn't have HIV, but probably has something else going on to cause the reaction."

pernicat,headphones,1391190047.0,"I am a bit confused about what you are asking about the [Modi](http://schiit.com/products/modi)? As far as I can tell it is USB powered and I don't see how a transformer would even figure into the equation. Where you maybe talking about the [Magni](http://schiit.com/products/magni)?

Since we are going from AC to AC we can use an adapter that is simply a step down transformer. If it needs 14-20VAC then a 120 VAC to 20 VAC transformer would probably work with 100VAC. 

      120 / 20 = 100 / x
      100 * 20 = 120 * x
    2000 / 120 = x
             x = 16.7

So if we used a 120 VAC to 20 VAC transformer, we would get about 16.7 VAC when plugged into a 100 VAC outlet.

I am not sure what size the Barrel plug is but something like [this adapter](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Triad-Magnetics/WAU20-500/?qs=LASUwJSZkDkn6JIHWiQclg%3d%3d) would probably work. There is also the [Wall-wort sold on the Schiit site](http://schiit.com/products/magnivali-wall-wart) but it only outputs 16VAC on 120VAC so it would only output about 13.3VAC with 100VAC. I think 13.3VAC is enough on the low side that you might have issues.

**Disclaimer:** This type of calculation only works with AC to AC power supplies that are simply a step-down transformer. AC to DC power supplies work differently."

&gt;You recognize that he is a deep, multi-faceted person, and his actions are not just the result of personal choice, but of his whole upbringing and the culture that he was raised in.

Do I? For someone who professes to be liberal, you're not giving the group very much credit. Honestly, it kinda sounds like a conservative's caricature of The Liberal Mindset. 

It's too bad that people are brought up to believe backward hateful things that politicians are able to seize upon in the same way it's too bad that people are brought up in poverty and drawn to crime. Believe it or not, the two are related. Closely. If we can chip away at the first, the latter will be able to improve, and vice versa to a certain extent.

The difference in tone is probably reducible to the difference in influence. Social conservatives are *extremely* politically and culturally influential, and that shit affects peoples' real lives, both directly and indirectly. Petty criminals are nothing, in essentially every sense of the word. You don't stop crime by getting mad and belittling people, whereas when you're confronting social ignorance, you arguably can, and you certainly aren't hurting anything. Furthermore, who's on the other side? Liberals supposedly have no sympathy for social conservatives, but that's because social conservatives are on the wrong side of important issues, and are a competing interest. Who's ""for"" criminals? This sympathy you speak of is a reaction to the, for lack of a better term, conservative approach to them, the stereotyped version of which is something on the order of ""they're animals! Build more prisons! Cut welfare programs!"" If you aren't on board with that approach, what do you suggest? On an individual level, the reaction isn't as you describe it. Liberals get pissed when some lowlife robs them, that doesn't mean they hate the underclass. Liberals don't want red state kids learning about intelligent design for exactly the same reasons."

The presence of false positives on a case to case basis is also significantly lower than the reported number, at least for the labs I've been working in, as we run extremely specific and complex quality control on everything we use. I'm not saying that OP should think she has HIV just because of the two positive ELISA tests. There are many different things that we run ELISA testing on because it is rapid and screening, so it will tell us if more testing in necessary. I myself have positive ELISA tests, as I have severe chronic allergies. Also anyone that has an autoimmune condition would also have a positive ELISA test every time. This is because the antibody-antigen reactive complex that ELISA tests for is found in many different disease states. The whole purpose of a screening test is to ensure that diseases are caught in the testing process and that people are sent for more testing when needed.

jeweledtree,TwoXChromosomes,1391190658.0,"So, I'm all for extremely open communication. My fiance and I probably go over board with the communication, so what I would do may not be the norm for people. I came from past relationships though where there was zero communication, and I spent all my time building things up in my head, letting anxiety get the best of me etc. So I really love the openness I have now. I think a lot of this comes down to your personal communication styles as well.

**FH's communication style:** He really wants to talk things out the second something comes up, really wants me to tell him the second I'm angry, etc. He hates leaving things till the next morning, for example. 

**My communication style:** I really need to process how I feel about something before I'm ready to talk about it. I need to calm down, and sort out why or to what extent I'm upset. Also, I like to decide if it's even something I stay upset about, or if I forget it by the next day. 

I think an excellent starting point for improving communication in a relationship is to just sit down and have a conversation about how you would like to communicate. And then try to figure out a compromise that sounds like it would work for both of you for future issues.

**For your particular hypothetical:**
I would wait until the next day, first of all. You're both tired, and bringing this up right after sex could get a bit too emotional, and feelings could get hurt way more than they need to be for the issue. So I would probably bring it up over breakfast, or just whatever downtime you have the next morning. I would say: 

""So [name], I kind of wanted to talk to you about last night. Remember the other day we were talking about spicing things up a bit? Well, I'm really glad that we tried to do that last night, but I'm feeling like maybe it wasn't quite enough of what I had in mind. I know you were tired, so maybe that's all it was, but I felt like you just weren't as excited about sex last night. It felt like you were being a bit passive, and I would like you to take the lead a bit more. Did you like the lingerie I bought? Is there something else we could have done that you would've liked better?""

And I would give him time within that to actually answer the questions, and have a conversation about it. I would also end the conversation suggesting some other fun things, maybe suggesting I put the lingerie on for him that afternoon, when he won't be so tired, and we can try it out again.  

For other situations, like where one person really angered the other, I do think it's important to explain how you feel, instead of accusing and blaming. In my past, that always got me the retort of ""Well I'm sorry you're angry,"" instead of a real apology for the action, and this is now a red flag to me. If I'm explaining to you how I feel, I might also add in something like ""I don't think you did this on purpose, but, that doesn't change the fact that it still upset me.""

So, this is probably way longer than needed, but I happen to care a lot about communicating. :)"
xxhamudxx,Gunners,1391190662.0,"This is the comment I can get behind. I'm sick of this ineffective, apologetic, and ""holier than thou **other fans**"" attitude so many fucking people have in this subreddit. 

I don't give a rat's ass about Draxler, he was ***ONE PLAYER*** who even I can agree was a tad expensive. Nobody here's crying to get Arsene sacked (just take a look at my flair). But why, why the fuck are people talking about ""impulse buys"" when we we've had a month to at least pick up a couple mediocre to decent players into our injury-riddled squad (even on a fucking loan) just to add depth? There were weak spots everyone knew of before January that needed to be managed if we were to win the league. Are people okay with the constant procrastination? Why the fuck is management scrambling now for anybody and a 31 year old who hit his prime years ago? This isn't a desperate signing because we are are filled with injuries, this is a ""desperate signing"" because anyone who's watched the guy knows he will honestly add little to nothing to the table this season partly because he will remain on the bench as an insurance policy. 

It's this beyond pretentious and stupid attitude that will lead us to be okay with not winning the league for a 10th year, in a season where we've been 1st place for almost the last 20 out of 24 weeks. Are people seriously okay with this outcome?

I'm not saying all women who enjoys sex and is in touch with her sexuality will have a history of one night stands.  But let's say she's 28 and hasn't been married - it's likely that she will have had multiple romantic relationships and thus, multiple sexual partners in her history.  

I think shared sexual values are important.  If you value sex only in a romantic context and only have sex with women you're in a romantic relationship with, and seek women who share that value, that's cool, but it doesn't mean she's going to be a virgin unless you met her in high school, and marrying your high school girlfriend also seems to be a good way to ensure a DB.

It is all a matter of finding what you like.  There is good stuff out there and bad stuff out there.  The soap I like might make you break out.  The soap you like might smell funny to me.  If you have a $50 monthly budget you can afford to try out nearly anything you want."

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1391191077.0,"I would also say that chattel slavery is very powerful thematically. You really can't drive home a point about dehumanization, human cruelty, dominance relationships, greed, etc., any harder than you can do it by showing some tall, opulently dressed man beating the living hell out of some innocent pauper child who didn't jump fast enough to do their bidding. Like, damn.

And how great is Django Unchained? Amistad? Uncle Tom's Cabin? The Jungle, to some extent. So much poetry and prose has been written that uses the power of slavery to make a point.

That being said, these works are *about* slavery. It's not a small detail, not 'moral leverage' like jwebb criticized above. I think that distinction is important, because in the latter case it's usually not an integral part of the story and ends up losing any of the visceral impact which makes it a useful element."

partspace,AskWomen,1391191498.0,"I chop mine short every few years when I donate my hair to charity. So I go from very long to very short pixie regularly. It's close to the 12 inches needed now, but I'm going to keep it long until I'm a bridesmaid in a friend's wedding in June. I can't wait to lop it all off. Here's my thoughts. 

Short hair is more of a chore to maintain, but also easier in other ways.

Maintaining a short haircut usually means regular trips to the salon for a trim, while with longer hair I would only visit for my ritual chopping.

Short hair also for me requires product, while when I have long hair I use absolutely nothing. I am a fan of waxes and pomades, and this requires a daily styling, while with long hair I put it up in a pony and I'm good to go.

Also, growing it out to long again can be a nightmare. There's this awful awkward stage that needs a lot of trips to the salon and creative styling. 

On the pro side, though, no more breaking or split ends! No rubber bands needed, or any pins or clips of any kind! It dries so much faster, and my shower time is much quicker. I use less shampoo and zero conditioner. I can be more adventurous with my coloring, as it will grow out in a month or two. It also just feels better to me, there's less weight on your head, and it feels soooo good to run your fingers through your hair.

I also think I just look better with short hair. My hair is so fine and my skin so oily that when it's long, by the end of the day long hair makes me look like a greasy hippie.

As for reactions, I've never really noticed any, other than friends who are surprised by how long it's getting, and the compliments after I finally chop it off. "

I never made the claim that they would affect unemployment rates or damage the economy, and don't believe they would. My uneducated suspicion is simply that they don't do much to help, and cause the cost of living to go up overall. Anecdotally, the states that I can think of off the top of my head that have higher minimum wages also have the highest costs of living, though I'm not implying causation.

All I am saying is that I've read/listened to several economists talk about (many of the details over my head) the minimum wage and their conclusions are skeptical that they actually help the inherent problems with a stagnant economy."

exitingcarisfail,relationships,1391191686.0,"And I've said that multiple times. That's the point of the Western Blot test. I run these labs on a daily basis for my work. I know the many different things that cause a positive ELISA test. The main one we run daily is allergies, which is an autoimmune condition. HIV and autoimmune diseases are the two major disease states that we run an ELISA screening on. 

I'm just trying to clarify that all of the people saying that just because the second test was positive, it could still be a false positive. That is not the case. That is the reason the second test is run. They are not run together and do not use the same sample, so adding the probabilities of false positives together is not correct. We also run extensive quality control tests on each panel as they are performed, so there would not be two false positives. 

I'm trying to help OP by having her understand that the positive results are positive for a reason, but that it DO NOT mean she has HIV. We have people that come in with severe allergies that have the ELISA panel done. People with autoimmune hemolytic anemia that have the test performed. ELISA is a screening test, which looks for the antibody-antigen reactive complex present in many different disease states. After the two positive ELISA tests, another sample is sent out for a Western Blot, which is a confirmatory test. This means that based on the different results of this test, we can tell you exactly what disease state is present. Allergies, versus, HIV, versus hemolytic anemia all look very different in how they result on the Western Blot. She needs to wait for those results to come back before doing anything, as it might be something as simple as having chronic allergies and not HIV. But there is also a chance that she has gotten HIV from a past partner.

All of the people telling her it could be nothing because they both could have been false positives are giving her a false sense of hope that nothing at all could be wrong. There is something going on in her body that are causing these positive results. Whether it is life threatening or something minor is yet to be seen, but if you don't 100% know about the testing procedures and the results that come from it, you should not be giving other people advice. Medical conditions are extremely important and difficult to understand. So are the testing procedures and results."

duckduck_goose,AskWomen,1391191817.0,"It used to be for me. (A deal breaker) Then I met a guy and we didn't have sex though we did quite a bit leading *up to sex* without including penetration. We talked also, pillow talk as it were, about his past experiences and his worldview on sex which aligned with my own. I had probably *more chemistry* with him that I have had with a lot of other people I dated long-term because I weirdly instantly trusted him. 

I mean I agreed to be exclusive with him before we had sex and wasn't really concerned with ""will we have great sex"" since I realized we would have a great relationship which in turn would probably entail great sex. And probably a lot of it. So it's no longer a dealbreaker. However, especially with the above dude, I'd probably end up rushing the marriage thing so I could phone in on all that boning which in turn could be a bad idea!?"

I_FUCK_UP_RECIPES,AskMen,1391191934.0,"Don't feel that way.  

Of my wealth, some $80,000 of it is inherited from my father's recent passing.  

$92,000 is in my house after deducting the mortgage (and valued based on when I bought in early 2012), which was paid for by money originally set aside by both my parents and myself in my name for my college/graduate education (both were free due to fellowships I was able to land--and my willingness to base my education decisions on money).

The other $90,000 is divided between my ROTH and 401k, the former of which was where most of my money went from working odd jobs as a kid.  Dad had a good program in place for me: for every dollar I put in the ROTH, he'd put a dollar into my college investment account.  Really taught me the value of investing--not just saving but being willing to put risk to my money--from a young age.  

I'd trade it all for another year with him."

Usually it's me when the relationship has run its course and/or the guy does something to hurt me. (Cheating) If it's early on usually it's unmet needs or mismatched compatibility. 

Usually it's them early on because I'm not I guess compatible or because they decided to go with another lady instead. Long term I was only dumped once by him but I kept attempting to *walk* from that way before he finally ended it so it was mostly mutual.

Right? ""Oh no, that poor person has a nice thing!""

...I'm sorry that my Dad and Mom pay for my phone so I can keep in touch with them, can get calls for job interviews, and have something to use in emergencies. I am a young woman with a car in a place where if you don't have a car, you aren't getting anywhere. That car can still break down and I can still get in an accident, and it is a huge load of worry off of my Daddy's mind that I can call 911 or him if I need to. I still have zero income and I'm still very very hungry. Please don't hate me for having parents that have a family plan. This nice phone was free for them. I still need to eat. 

Also, ""Oh no, that poor person has nice clothing!"" Yes, you see, once upon a time (not too long ago!) I had a well paying job. Then I got pneumonia, and I used more than my allotted sick time. I was fired the day I returned to work. Should I have sold all of my clothes? To who? Who the hell will pay me enough for my used clothes to justify me having nothing but rags to wear? And then, when I get a job again, what the hell am I supposed to wear to the interview and before my first paycheck?

My husband had a decent job, too. And then, when he joined the Navy, his employers suddenly found a reason to fire him. Illegal if they had admitted the cause of him being fired, but unprovable.

I understand that it pisses you off to see me on the line at Social Services and then to see me calling my Mommy on the nice phone, while wearing a skirt suit and holding a nice looking matching purse. However, that skirt suit is 5 years old, my Mommy and Daddy pay for that phone, and my purse is a ten year old Walmart bag that I just take very good care of.

My husband and I split a single box of pasta over two days for the two of us every day for a good 3 months. Then we got on foodstamps for 3 months. I was able to eat and get better. Sure, I couldn't afford soap to wash the dishes with (no cash benefits) but I could ask for a few bucks from a friend, and a bottle of dishwashing soap can last a long time. Sure, I had to steal toilet paper (the most immoral thing I've ever done) from friends' homes but hey, I was finally eating again, and I'm sure that any judgement I receive in an after life will not begrudge me toilet paper. Sure, we got evicted from our home and had to move into my sister's basement, but DAMMIT, there was food in my belly.

And then my husband was finally able to actually GO to the Navy (ten month wait) and we've been paying back into the system way more than the $900~ dollars those three months of foodstamps cost the government.

i_am_a_freethinker,mormon,1391192886.0,"I mean that the idea of Satan being the ""opposite of god"" or something to that effect was not in the theology of the ancient Jews, especially not around 500 BC. In the Torah, ""satan"" is basically a tester, an advisary, a trial. But the Torah satan *is in cahoots* with God. The same holds true with all the OT. Thus, you get Job being tried by the advesary, and God and Satan talking to one another. 

There were *not* notions of Jesus Christ, there were notions of a savior. This savior would be a **warrior**, and would crush the neighboring countries and restore Israel to prominence. He would be a great leader. Jesus Christ, the historical figure, did not fit the bill.

Isaiah 7:14 is a mistranslation; ""virgin"" should be ""young woman"" or something like that. The reason that Mary is touted to be a virgin is because it was mistranslated, the folks writing the NT had to fit Christ into that prophecy.

Micah 5:2 refers to the warrior/leader/ruler of Israel, the savior, *not Jesus Christ*. The fact that Christ did not meet the Jews expectation of the savior is one of the main reasons that they rejected early Christianity.

Then, of course, you have the sticky issue that *Christ never said he was the Son of God*, or that he was God. The earliest author in the NT, Paul, never calls Christ the Son of God. Matthew, Mark, and Luke don't, either. It's not till you reach John that Christ is equated to God.

Christ was an apocolyptic prophet who literally thought that the world would end *in his own generation*, and that God was coming to rule the Earth.

You are taking your own modern mythologies and back-painting the rest of the Old Testament to fit them. "

Your assertion that medical staff ensure that players have to be in a healthy condition to play is a joke, and I'm surprised you attempt to say that given all of the news the last few years surrounding player injury/health and getting put on the field anyway.

I've walked with a state DOL OSHA inspector (who showed up randomly) through a plant. Employees are protected and allowed to report OSHA violations (and I suspect that is why this inspector showed up ""randomly""), and there are anti-discrimination and whistleblower laws on the books in my state that companies take very seriously, because the kinds of law suits that come about because of those issues are much larger than any fines that OSHA might impose.

I never said worker's compensation paid great or was perfect, simply that it exists, and that if you do get hurt on the job you will be covered, and you do have the right to sue the hell out of a company that doesn't abide by the regulations.

And yes, any employee who gets hurt on the job and given worker's comp is not going to speak of it fondly, but when you are comparing the alternative of getting hopped up on pain meds and shoved back out there or losing your job altogether if you can't, as happens in the NFL, it is a better alternative.

This not even remotely a contradiction.

My argument has always, always been about morality. It was only about 300 in how the morality mattered there, not the killing. Whether Leonidas  killed Xerxes and defeated persia, which he decidedly did not, has no bearing on why he's the hero, why he's sympathetic, and why the audience identifies and supports him.

&gt;That has never been a point we were arguing. The point is, there is a 5-minute ending at Plataea, because the movie intends to portray the defeat of the Persian

Oh, but it is. If the movies were about power, it'd be decisive victory after decisive victory. The movie isn't about ""the defeat of the persian"" it's about the [sacrifice of Leonidas.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kuna7sC5ek) The spartans are killed to the last. [Here's the final minute or so (of a 2 hour movie.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh6JeO5aDEU) No battle. No victory. Just a speech about Leonidas' morality.

WormTickle,bestof,1391193449.0,"Wow, that sounds very unlike the experience I've had with our local panhandlers.

They are recognizable faces in the community. They are the first people who ran to help me and make sure I was OK when someone nearly ran up the curb with their car and I had to dive out of the way.

Beard Man and His Cat have hilarious signs. He just chills out at the WalMart exit with his cat, and he has about 40 signs that he flashes at different cars. He ALWAYS flashes ""You're a ten!"" at me unless it's raining. (It's often raining out in WA.) During the drizzles, he holds up, ""Love that sunshine!"" I like to ask him what he needs from WalMart and get him something. Usually he wants bread or cat food. Sometimes it's peanut butter.

We've got a disabled homeless vet who chills out near the Safeway. He likes fruit and veggies, but sometimes I'll hand him a candy bar or something too, and he always gets super happy. He's also really sweet to my daughter. He takes the local bus and has had hilarious conversations with her. She's 2, and they're friends.

We've got a lady with frazzled hair who stands at a different grocery store. I make it a point to give her feminine hygiene products in addition to some food when I can. There is nothing more humiliating than not having tampons or pads when you're menstruating. (Girl Code dictates you try to keep other women from feeling that way. Even your worst enemy. I don't care if that bitch stole your boyfriend, if you have a tampon and she needs one, you fucking hand it over.)

I almost forgot about the guy who sits in Burger King all day. He comes in the morning, gets a coffee, and is in and out until close. He reads books from our local library and quietly drinks his coffee. He's super chill. My daughter likes to say hi to him whenever we go to BK, and he talks to her kindly and with respect.

I'm sorry that you've had such annoying experiences. In all of my time living and working in places that had a homeless presence I have never encountered that kind of behavior. I've shared pizza with a guy in Penn Station when I was in high school. I've given water bottles to people in the hot weather. I've even given money on rare occasions. At no point did anyone treat me like they weren't pleased to get some help, and at no point have I ever had a homeless person get pissy because I couldn't help out."

Moses 3:4-7; see also Moses 1 and Moses 2, and compare with Gen. 1 and Gen. 2
 
&gt;It is held by some that Adam was not the first man upon this earth, and that the original human being was a development from lower orders of the animal creation. These, however, are the theories of men. The word of the Lord declares that **Adam was 'the first man of all men'** (Moses 1:34), and we are therefore in duty bound to regard him as the primal parent of our race. It was shown to the brother of Jared that all men were created in the beginning after the image of God; and whether we take this to mean the spirit or the body, or both, it commits us to the same conclusion: Man began life as a human being, in the likeness of our heavenly Father.""

What does blame matter? If people die, it allows the remaining family to sue, but what about trying to prevent loss of life?

When you die and it's someone else's fault, does that mean you aren't dead? What if you are in the right, legally, but made decisions that led you to that death? Does that change anything?

Blaming the injuring party might get you paid, but won't prevent the injury. Especially when it happens again.

Imo, the blame game is stupid because no one tries to learn. Pointing out how what happened to you was someone  fault precludes trying to think, ""what could I have done differently to prevent this?"" Playing the blame game is a foolish cowardly action that continues to endanger riders.


Imo, when you ride a motorcycle you, the rider, are always responsible for your life.

I've been trying to make this point for months and I always get downvoted. That makes me think that a lot of rideit shouldn't be riding, since they aren't mature enough to not try to push the blame to others.

Maybe I've usually always been to blame, so I am more able to accept some, if not all of it. But when I ride, I attempt to avoid situations where I can blame others for causing me harm and I do this by being proactive. By always assuming the worst outcomes and finding the safe path that avoids them."

xtphr,dogecoin,1391193735.0,"I'm excited for two big reasons:

1. Assuming dogecoin doesn't go too much over $1 per Ɖ, it solves something the internet has needed since the beginning: A reliable method of micro-transactions.  I can start a news service that charges $0.50 for an ""edition"" of the newspaper without getting killed by Visa or Paypal fees. I can start a highly technical blog catering to a niche that charges $0.05 per article and defray hosting costs. This can be way bigger than just tipping on reddit or twitter or imgur. This can be a whole new approach to the internet (and hopefully, a way to move away from using advertisements as our sole revenue source).

2. The dogecoin community has built a strong anti-hoarding culture. Your job, as a citizen of Doge, is to keep the economy moving. You win when you give away your doge, especially to someone who has none, because it builds the economy, and makes Doge worth more. Holding on like some kind of Doge Grinch hurts everyone. When economies resemble a standing lake with a fence around it, they fall apart. When they resemble a full ecosystem, constantly pushing and pulling and feeding and giving and moving, that's when they're healthy. No other altcoin community has this going for it."

Having a few thousand swords in one location doesn't mean much. I mean, the Lannister's had the swords - and more swords (and gold) than Stannis - and that didn't prevent a good chunk of the realm from rebelling.

The Faith Militant has been rearmed, thanks to Cersei, and they do have a history of rebellion. They were disarmed by Jaehaerys I Targaryen after a rebellion that had consumed the reigns of his two predecessors, Aenys and Maegor. The rebellion began due to the fact that Aenys was born of incest, not because Aenys followed a different religion or forced people to convert. The Faith just saw Aenys as an abomination, much as they would see followers of R'hollor. And why would the people join the Faith Militant? Well, lords and knights would likely support the cause for their own reasons, whilst the common folk may see it as an opportunity to vent their anger, or even as simply a way to join a cause and therefore be provided with food, shelter, and company.

Oh, and lets not forget that there are rival claimants to the throne, in the form of two Targaryens, who would gladly support and exploit any opposition Stannis."

You could say the same about HSBC employees. I bet you wouldn't though.

Think about it. What is the purpose of putting people in jail for a given crime? Deterrence (to prevent others from committing that crime) - the crime no longer exists, nothing to deter. Incapacitation (to prevent that person from committing crime) - is there any reason to believe they'll commit other crimes? Rehabilitation (to turn that person into the kind of the kind of person who won't commit crime) - there's little argument that this is a real goal of the American prison system, but again, no longer a crime. Retribution (to punish the person) - society has determined that their act is unworthy of punishment. You say they ""deserve"" it, but based on what?

My point is that it isn't just harder because of all the steps you *might* have to take but also that you can't ever be sure that something will work on hour device. The many thousands of android devices to choose from means that there are just too many devices out there that the mod won't work on because no dev can cover them all.

With Jailbreaking, its a lot simpler. Running iOS 7? Download and run evasion7. Running iOS 6? Download and run evasi0n. Running something older? Find out what to use by visiting www.jailbrea.kr

Simple and thanks to a lower number of devices, its easier for the devs to cover all of   them which most will do."

clockworkgirl21,AdviceAnimals,1391194533.0,"Taylor Swift is over the age of 13. So even if he said yes, he wouldn't be a pedophile.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia

&gt;Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children, generally age 11 years or younger, though specific diagnostic criteria for the disorder extends the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13.

And since Taylor Swift is over the age of 19, he wouldn't even be an ephebophile.

ChibiOne,asktransgender,1391194541.0,"Yes, that helps a lot, thank you.  I had heard that valerate *has* to pass through the liver to be processed into it's active state, where the body can make use of it.  Whereas hemihydrate is already in a form the body can use without the need to pass through the liver first.  However, I've always heard that injectables are easier on the liver than even sublingual administration.  I can't find any thing to confirm (or deny) the claim that valerate must be processed by the liver regardless of avenue of delivery, however.  

So I've been left a bit confused.  I want to do what is best for the liver, overall.  But several friends have switched to injections recently and they have all raved that their results were significantly improved on the injections as compared to the pills.  Any idea on that, valerate having to go through first-pass metabolism to become ""active""?"

Based on how she posted, this happened within the last two days. There's no way that the Western Blot results would be back yet. She also stated that how she made it sound in her post was that they didn't counsel her, when in fact they did. She wasn't asking about the testing results, she was asking how to tell her significant other.

The people that take the sample and the people that run the test are two completely different people, who have completely different jobs. The one running the test knows what it's testing for and what results mean. The person collecting the sample might not know 100% what the results mean in the sense of a positive or negative diagnosis. We weren't there, so we can't speculate what was said or presented to OP.

I can 100% guarantee that she was told to be on call for a follow up appointment with a doctor to discuss the results when they come in. But that won't be for a week at the earliest, but usually around two to three weeks. Until then, nothing can be said one way or the other if she has or does not have HIV.

thesilvertongue,pics,1391194974.0,"I can see why someone might argue why it is a genocide because any of the deaths of the Native Americans were deliberate attacks. 

On the other hand, diseases such as small pox were also a primary factor in the decimation of natives. The sheer number of deaths would cripple any society. I realize that settlers did intentionally exacerbate the problem by spreading disease intentionally but small pox on it's own would have still wiped out the population to a large extent. 

Even if the settlers had taken human right's into account epidemics would still have happened on a very large scale. 

Perhaps the strongest argument in favor of the term genocide would be in reference to the Trail of Tears. This argument suggests that a genocide began in the 1830s with the Indian Removal act. While this was an awful event which clearly violated human rights, many argue that genocide must be a systematic intentional slaughter rather than criminal negligence. In this case most but certainly not all of the deaths during this relocation were disease and starvation caused by negligence. The government may have caused these deaths they were a consequence and not the aim. 

While the aim of this Act was to remove people from their homes and many died along the way, many scholars argue that systematic killing was not the aim of this tragic endeavor. 

I am not trying to belittle or make light of the human rights abuses against Native Americans. I am just trying to explain why many scholars do not classify it as a genocide.

I went to see Into It Over It alone on Wednesday. It was my proposed first date ""wanna hang"" message to the guy I'm no longer seeing so I felt really bummed to be there alone. Usually I'm okay with it but it was a hard internal feeling to shake. ANYHOW I really love Into It Over It and Evan, the singer, is so darn cute. He's just really positive on stage and has these super cute dimples when he's smiling. (Swooon) So I'm like watching the band when out of the crowd this dude *grabs me* from behind in kind of an aggressive hostile manner. I turn around and he shoves his flip phone in my face while gesturing at the screen. I guess he had typed a message to me on it but I was so stunned, startled, upset I didn't read it. I was scrunching up my face and kind of backing away from him. He made this shrugging gesture at me while still shoving his phone in my face. I think (THINK) I shook my head no at him before turning back to the band who began to play the song about Portland Oregon.

I have no idea what the dude was trying to say to me but I'm still upset bothered by it days later.

Also I'm critically broke (still) and have obligations this weekend that require financial backing. My room is painted this green the color of hospital walls because the Ace dude tinted my WHITE PAINT a really awful shade of too green green! [I noticed the white shade in photos did have a slight green-grey tint to it but this was SUPER hospital mint green] So I'm awaiting tax return funds to hit my bank account so I can repair the green and actually taking into account what Hog said about using color. TBD but I can't believe I'm taking advice from resident Hog :|

In other news the guy I am no longer seeing made a passive aggressive FB post that included ""me"" in it about how vulgar crass and stupid it is when people hashtag things as ""food porn"" or ""car porn"" online. I do this quite a lot on instagram linked to my FB. I called him out on this fact and he deleted the FB post. I'm still really mad about it because it was passive aggressive and petty. I don't know if I have a right to be angry but I have to refrain from even looking at his FB now because I just wanna unfriend him and give him the cold stare at future (basement) shows.

You would think that he might have asked and given that conversation as detail as to why he was blindsided later. He didn't. Therefore I assume, yes, assume, that he passively let the entire thing happen.

The title of the episode ""Wake-up Call"" says just as much to us about everyone as kaga and banri did to each other.

both Banri realized that he was taking kaga for granted, and was thinking only of himself. and kaga was given a stark reminder of banri's past, and what it could mean if it happened again. something she was worried about already, but the accident made it much more real.

and perhaps most of all it was a wake up call for Ghost Banri, who was extremely conspicuous by his absense. Ghost Banri learned that he can go too far, Linda can't be in a relationship with a dead Banri.

my question is, is ghost banri going to be much more reserved now? and when is linda coming back, we know in no uncertain terms that Linda loved Banri, it was pretty much spelled out. That confrontation has to happen, if only to give everyone some closure."

scottious,getdisciplined,1391195974.0,"My advice is to slowly replace your TV habits with other habits.  Emphasis on slowly.  Some people might be able to do it cold turkey but it might be too much of a shock for you.  Start like this:

* Section off 1 hour every night or every few nights in which you would normally be watching Netflix.  For just that one hour, do *anything* else that you consider productive or a ""good habit"".  After that hour, just stop unless you're really into it.

* If an hour is too much, start smaller.

* Do this consistently.  Make it so you have to feel like you've 'earned' TV.

This was my approach and over a few years I now don't even want to watch TV when I'm home.  I actually don't turn it on at all during the week anymore and only a little bit on weekends to catch up on a few shows."

BelleLune,beyondthebump,1391196029.0,"We are in the process of trying to change up our LO's sleeping habits. She is almost 6 months old now. Up until now, we've co-slept (she has a co-sleeper style crib) and nursed to sleep. But she would be up 6+ times each night and spent what felt like forever just nursing. It's only been 3 nights, so can't really tell if it's ""working"" or not just yet, but we seem to be moving in the right direction!

Old bedtime routine: feed oatmeal at 6:45pm, followed by bath, followed by nursing to sleep (usually asleep by 8pm). Then she'd wake up quite often up until 10pm-midnight (usually right around the time hubby and I would come into bed; nursed her to sleep each time), then at about midnight, she'd last 2 hours between nursing sessions.

New bedtime routine: We changed her crib to be a stand-alone crib and moved our bed into a different room than hers. Feed her oatmeal at 6:45pm, then bath (just like before). But after the bath, we let her stay up and play until she starts acting tired/yawning a lot (about 8pm), then I nurse her to sleep. 

Night #1 of the new method, she still woke up 6 times, at her normal times, but I didn't nurse her to sleep each time, I was able to rock her back to sleep quite a few times. Night #2, she only woke up 4 times and hubby rocked her to sleep once and I nursed her to sleep the other times (after he tried to rock her to sleep and her freaking out). Last night was night #3 and she only woke up TWO times and I nursed her back to sleep.

Fingers crossed this pattern stays put!"

Yes they made a mistake saying she tested positive for HIV. Like I said, this has to do with the difference between who is interacting with the patient and who is working in the lab. We report out a positive result, we don't say that means which disease state. That is left for the doctor to be taking our reporting of the results and turning it into what they tell the patient. They were not wrong to tell her that she had a positive result, as the test was positive. They were wrong to tell her that it's 100% positive for HIV.  But OP did say that they had counseling to start after the final testing comes back, so this all is in how the results were phrased and presented to the patient. I'm not saying this is right, nor am I saying it's wrong. This happens EVERY day. Doctors and nurses don't completely understand how the tests work, they just understand the results that we in the lab report out. The nurse or whoever told OP the results might have said ""the test is positive"" not ""you tested positive for HIV"". In the scheme of life, nurses and other healthcare professionals see the positive result reported out from the lab and make the inference that the two mean the same. If this was the Western blot, then yes, they'd be the same. But because this is ELISA they are two completely different answers. Because we weren't there with OP when the conversation happened, we can't be sure which was said.

Yeah, Rubio shot himself in the foot there, on several levels.

Had he been pro-Amnesty from the beginning, he wouldn't have gotten the conservative appeal, but he at least would have been seen as principled and sticking to his beliefs (albeit principles that are terrible for Americans and for the country).

exitingcarisfail,relationships,1391196967.0,"This is actually no longer true and is a common misconception. While it is thought that people in homosexual relationships are at a higher risk of contracting HIV, this is not the case. If you look at statistics, not just for the US, but worldwide, in the last 10-15 years, women have been the higher percentage or on par with infected men. This is due to the heavy presence of IV drug use and people sharing needles. But the difference between hetero and homosexual relationships is no longer thought to be the main cause, as the stereotypes of anal versus vaginal sex is not distinguished between the two, as heterosexual relationships can also have anal sex. HIV is not just transmitted by blood, so you do not have to have tears or open sores to receive HIV from your partner. Blood, pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions, breastmilk, and anal secretions. They can be transmitted to the partner through an open wound, mucous membranes, or directly into the bloodstream. There are mucous membranes in the rectum, vagina, opening of the penis, and the mouth, so coming in contact, even without an open wound, with these fluids from an infected person can cause you to become infected with HIV.

His plane is not one dropping bombs. I don't feel comfortable saying more than that on Reddit. However, I will reiterate that I do not feel guilty for what he does when he deploys. He's a good Sailor doing good things. I do not like that the military is what it is right now. I am aware that no one raindrop feels responsible for the flood. I would not feel any measure of peace about his job if he were in a direct combat job or his job enabled the killing of innocent civilians.

Regardless, I wish those trillions would go to other things. A draw down with enough warning that the military members could find alternate employment to support their families would be wonderful. (Just suddenly cutting off our only income and sending my family back into poverty is obviously something I don't want.)

I'm a huge bleeding heart and wish the military would draw down. As it is, my husband is working on his apprenticeship qualifications that will give him a way to transition to a civilian job as an electrician. He'll be able to work for a commercial airline, as an electrician for home or office constructions, or work for the utility company or phone company.

Let the people who are in finish their contracts. Don't renew unless they're vital (losing all the upper level experienced Sailors is a TERRIBLE idea. Having people with no experience running a massive war machine is a recipe for disaster) and give fair warning when they're not. Expand social services. Expand aid for the people right here at home. Allow people to join the active reserves or Nat'l Guard to keep up with having a military that can protect us when we need it to. Healthcare! Food! Shelter!

Yeah. Exactly, that's what I'm saying. Your formula (which uses FTs and FGAs) accounts for minutes played, which many formulas fail to do. Usually you have to resort to per 36 numbers when comparing two players, but your stat allows us to avoid this problem.

&gt; Besides, if both people were ""average"", both PARs would be 0 because it's a measure of far above or below average a player is.

Yeah and again, that's where you could tweak the formula or make alternates where, like, the 1.07 coefficient is lower. Many ways to go"

&gt;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. 
Arthur C. Clarke, ""Profiles of The Future"", 1961

If he is open minded enough he will listen.  This approach you have to take the Bible a little more literally in some parts, and interpret them with modern eyes.  And since most of the Bible is all interpretation anyway...this is not a far strech.  

We call agree God would not be of this planet...so in essense he is an extraterrestrial.  You can bring up the Airplane Cult that arose during/after WWII when primitives saw airplanes flying over head and thought they were gods.  An excellent real world example of how a primitive people would react to technology far beyond thier grasp.

Ask your friend to try to describe a modern fighter jet breaking the sound barrier without any modern terminology.  Have him pretend he has never seen one before...then have him read his answer.  How would primitive man describe something they saw?

You don't have to believe in the theory to use it to point out another interpretation of events.  You can bring up that many cultures tell stories of Gods from the skys, or star beings.

I could go one for quite some time on the subject...to me Ancient Aliens make more sense and has more support then any religious explanation.  But this is all just to make your friend think from a different perspective and look into why he believes as he does.

Other questions?
What Makes your Version of Christianity right?  Why are the Aboriginal Peoples beliefs wrong?  Religions older then Judaism...what about thier beliefs?  Why would they even exist?

Look up interpretations from the Bible.  Try to find how one denomination says one thing about the passage and another has a completely different view.   Like Blood Transfusions...and ask hime who is right.  Why are they right?  Why are the others wrong...etc.

Zaranthan,Warframe,1391197321.0,"&gt;1) Is there a hard cap to how far you can level up each mod? I currently have a Vitality mod for my Warframe that gives me +200% HP and I am wondering if mods come to a point where they just stop increasing in value.

Yes. If you look on the left edge of the card, you'll see a number of white bars showing its current rank and a number of black bars showing how many more ranks it progresses to.

&gt;2) While looking over the abilities of the Warframes, I came across the Maximization page on the Wiki and I really don't understand how this works. If someone could shed some light here, I would appreciate it.

Those are just mod combos that allow you to hit the absolute limit of what is possible in the game at the moment by combining mods that stack effects. For example, the first section shows you that you can boost Power Duration up to 157% on most warframes. Going beyond that is simply impossible (aside from using the Power Duration boosting helmets specific to Trinity and Volt).

&gt;3) Are the Mastery missions always so hard? I haven't played a PC shooter since Half-Life 2 (and the original Call of Duty before that), so I'm incredibly rusty (and probably just plain bad), but it took me 5 days just to complete the Primary Weapon missions to get from Mastery 0 to Mastery 1. The struggle to get there has been pretty frustrating, especially since I can only attempt the mission once per day and all the cool weapons are behind Mastery locks.

The time limit is pretty harsh. You have unlimited ammo, so try being more aggressive than you would in a normal mission.

&gt;4) I've been selling unwanted mods in order to fund some of the early forge creations, but now that I've unlocked some of the Infestation areas, getting credits seems to be a lot easier. Is transmuting unwanted mods worth the effort (it seems expensive, too) or should I just continue to with vendoring them?

Transmuting is a credit sink. You don't have limited mod space, so just leave 'em there until your forging is throttled by resources rather than credits. Personally, I get a kick out of using the fifty or so pressure points I seem to get every day as poor man's fusion cores on other melee V-polarity mods."

Most of the women were housewives who did not have their own source of income; one in particular allowed her husband full control of her finances because she simply didn't know how to manage them... which turned out that her husband cashed out all her stocks and now takes her social security checks as fuel for his gambling addiction. For many of them, there was nowhere for them to go and they didn't know any better since divorce was such a huge stigma. Marriage was the proper thing to do at a certain period of time in life and one was lucky if they actually managed to find someone who treated them well. I can't generalize and say this situation was normal, but for those who did suffer terrible marriages, there was no escape readily available."

In other words, we should recognize that we exist today because throughout history humans have banded together to help each other.  We should continue this trend because it is in our best interests.  We should take care of one another and help each other out because if we didn't our civilization would quickly fall apart, as we are currently bearing witness to today.

Listen to [David Simon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNttT7hDKsk), creator of *The Wire* and *Treme*, explain it.

Absolutely no evidence exists that demonstrates capitalism and socialism are mutally exclusive, but it's extremely important to remember that capitalism is *not* a social system.  It is an economic system.  Social policy cannot be determined based on its profitability.

A lot of evidence exists that socialism is good for the people of any country.  The United States in the early 20th century onward until the late 60's is a great example."

They increased the stroke to get another 10% displacement which gave them better torque curve but lost almost 1000 rpm off the top. This was also 10 years ago (F22C1 came out in '04).

I agree with you on the material facts: Davis sings traditional folk songs, Davis can't move on after his partner's death, Davis sings songs that internalizes (I think subconsciously) his conflicts), and so on. I happy to agree with you. But I disagree regarding both the interpretation you offer and with the success of the film even if it manages to do the things you claim.
  
The problem with the idea that the film concerns itself with a character who cannot move on. Is that there is no resolution of conflict. Once they've identified the scenario and its major themes, they should move on themselves. It's like the film thinks that it can successfully show stagnation by stagnating. Even at the very end, when you claim that he does move on… he doesn't. He doesn't get the song that he sings. He just sings it. It's subconscious commentary.
  
I think you also have to admit that even with his partner, he and all the other characters are stuck in an artistic rut, or eager to sell out for the right price. It would be one thing if Dylan had been haunting the production for more than in our imaginations and in one final scene.

duggtodeath,offbeat,1391198469.0,"&gt; Explain to me how in states with ""may issue"" concealed carry permit law (and in jurisdictions with well documented refusal of issue rates, the state of MD is a fine example of this) - that these citizens right to bear arms in exercise of their human right of self defense is NOT infringed.

""A May-Issue jurisdiction is one that requires a permit to carry a concealed handgun, and where the granting of such permits is partially at the discretion of local authorities (frequently the sheriff's department or police), with a few states consolidating this discretionary power under state-level law enforcement. The law typically states that a granting authority ""may issue"" a permit if various criteria are met, or that the permit applicant must have ""good cause"" (or similar) to carry a concealed weapon. **In most such situations, self-defense in and of itself often does not satisfy the ""good cause"" requirement.**""

However, I am sure you skipped over all that and instead focused on the criticism:

""Issuing authorities in some May-Issue jurisdictions have been known to arbitrarily deny applications for CCW permits without providing the applicant with any substantive reason for the denial.""

It is clear that the ""may issue"" states had the provision in place for quite some time. They did not just make this up to screw with people.

&gt; ""May-Issue can be compared to Shall-Issue where in a May-Issue jurisdiction, the burden of proof for justifying the need for a permit rests with the applicant, whereas in a Shall-Issue jurisdiction the burden of proof to justify denying a permit rests with the issuing authority.""

So the laws are different depending on jurisdiction. One state denying concealed carry does not mean that everyone has lost their rights, which is the genesis of your argument. There are plenty of places and situations in which no legal gun owner can carry a firearm, and those situations are not considered taking away any rights.

And, finally, I'll rest my case with this:

&gt; ""Maryland is considered a Restrictive May-Issue state, where issuing authorities are directed to deny most or all applications, either based on hard-to-meet ""good cause"" requirements or agency policies specifically prohibiting issue. Additionally, **Maryland requires the applicant provide substantive evidence of a clear and immediate threat on their lives that exists outside of their home at the time the permit application is filed**.""

You see how much better laws work when you actually read them?"

Actually, this whole thing reminds me of the bit in the last episode of Queer as Folk (the original one) where Nathan calls out his bully for being in the gay bar in order to impress his girlfriend, having previously beat up this boy while calling him a ""queer"".

And anyway, the UK is so brimming with closet homosexuals/people who'll anything when slightly drunk that being a ""lad"" seems to include ""acting a bit gay after having too much to drink"" i.e. kissing each other, slapping each other in the balls etc. Of course, it's deemed to ""being secure with your heterosexuality"" but one can't remove the fact that sexual intimacy with a man is still sexual intimacy with a man.

Unicornrows,TrueOffMyChest,1391198742.0,"I'm a guy who goes back and forth on the whole loving, honest, relationship thing on one hand and casual sex, red pill, ""trust no one"" on the other (I know casual sex can be honest and everything.) I've been like your husband sometimes and your man-whore coworker other times.

My knee-jerk reaction to this post was to judge you because I sympathize with your husband, but I know you want reassurance and I can sympathize with you too. I cheated on a girlfriend once and went on with the relationship with no remorseful behavior at the time. I think cheating is very common, and people just rarely talk about it. I dunno. I guess everyone has to make moral decisions on their own, and you can never know for sure if you can trust someone.

Your post might make ""Red Pillers"" nod their heads and say ""yup, this is how women work"". Dan Savage says ""people who only cheat a few times over a long relationship are still mostly monogamous."" I think literally no one has complete answers for moral and relationship questions; these concerns have plagued humanity forever and are even commonplace in the animal kingdom. Just live with it. Personally, I think it's good to forgive yourself no matter what you do, because no one should be on your side more than you.  We all impinge on one another's rights occasionally; that's part of life. 

But I really find the idea of an honest relationship appealing. You can't know if your husband is honest, but you know that you aren't, and I think that you are missing out on a big part of ""love"" by seeing him for just his surface qualities instead of having that raw honest connection and feeling like you are giving 100% to the relationship. 

But what do I know? Maybe it's better to just give your husband the illusion. Either way, **I think that cheating in a marriage is a risky and bad road to go down. It seems like it would keep you constantly on edge, not knowing whether you can buy a house together or whatever, since you might get caught and divorced at any time.**

I think that sexual desire is a dumb biological force, the same as the desire for a donut (we evolved to be attracted to sugar), and you should be aware of how it is driving you. Use your forebrain to selectively resist those urges, the same way you would resist eating every donut you see."

to rephrase that question is to ask when do i think a fetus becomes a human being or when do i think is the cut off for abortion deadline. this is good question worth deliberating, so i'm just gonna quote my response to someone else who asked the same:

&gt; the short answer is i don't know. i dont have the medical background on fetal development to make an informed decision. you can be super cynical and say abortion is okay whenever, simply take the fetus out and see if it [survives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability). a more sensible argument would be to allow abortions while the fetal viability is 0% but after that assume enough time has been given to make the decision and a commitment has been made.

in my mind someone who wants to get rid of their kid will do so anyway, whether through abortion or adoption, so in a certain light allowing for early abortions may be (not necessarily) more ""humane"" to the kid.

benk4,explainlikeimfive,1391199028.0,"&gt; Businesses hire until they reach they point where adding 1 more employee costs more than they generate. So if I have to pay my employees $8 an hour, I will hire until my next hire will generate less than or equal too $8 an hour.

Here's a real-life example.  

I own a small bar.  At the moment I just have 1 bartender on at any time.  They have to do drinks, and run in the back and make simple food items for people (stuff like mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers).  I'm thinking of increasing the size of my kitchen and offering a full menu, but I'd have to bring on a cook to do it.  I have to justify if paying the cook is worth the increased revenue I'd see. 

To make the example extreme, if I could pay the cook $2 per hour it would be a no-brainer.  If I was required to pay $20 per hour there's no way I'm hiring him.  I'd lose money.  

Currently minimum wage in my state is ~$8 per hour, but it's going up over the next few years.  $8 is right about at my projected break-even point.  With the state government talking about further increaseing it and making it $10 I'm definitely not hiring.  If it was $5 per hour I would definitely give it a shot.  So that's one job that's not being created due to a higher minimum wage.  

This isn't to say that it has a net increase or decrease on the job market.  There's benefits to the bottom line going up as well in terms of increased consumer spending.  The question over minimum wage is if the number of jobs lost/not created by the increase outweighs the benefits."

Dystaxia,AskReddit,1391199088.0,"When we were 17, my friend and I smuggled alcohol across the border from Canada to the US. We were visiting Washington, DC for a trip that the class had planned and decided it would be a sweet idea to get drunk at our hotel. It didn't work out quite how we anticipated but we weren't the only ones who ended up bringing alcohol and another classmate even brought a stash of weed. My friend and I just happened to get caught. 

Everything was going fine; we were 6 hours past the border when my friend was pulled aside and his backpack searched. Turns out another friend back home who he had been texting had their phone taken away. They read through the person's messages (that always really bothered me) and they had been discussing it. The school called one of the teachers on the trip and alerted them of the situation.

We were suspended when we got home but were also subject to consequences while on the trip. Our freedom to explore was greatly diminished but it ended up not being much of a burden. For the most part, our teacher would tell us where and when to meet and then let us explore as normal. When we went to an outlet mall on the way back, she actively distanced herself because she wanted to shop and we'd slow her down. We had a blast. It was a great trip.

**TLDR; Got caught after smuggling alcohol, enjoyed the trip regardless of punishment, and received an extended vacation from school.**"

Exactly. 

I really don't ""get"" the people in Qatar-- once you consider how excessive their upper middle and upper classes can be, and yet you see elements reaching out and sponsoring all these different people who they'd never want to actually come to Qatar, and who would go into hysterical killing spree mode if they somehow managed to attack members of Qatar's high society.

&gt; Apparently Hezbollah helped him escape from jail, along with Hezbollah members imprisoned by Mubarak. If that is true, I doubt they'll be breaking him out.

I never claimed that it was. I used the word duress and /u/supermegafuerte introduced the words ""peer pressure"". I was always talking about the intimidation tactic of getting people to drink. 

&gt;That's intimidation, which carries the implication of injury or harm. If you feel like you're in a very real danger of being hurt by someone then you're being assaulted which is very much already a crime.

Yes but using intimidation to force sex is an additional crime called rape. Using alcohol to be your middle man to make rape easier is still rape the same way using any other drug doesn't make it not rape. Forcing someone to have unwanted alcohol using intimidation in an effort to lead into unwanted sex is intimidation and rape the same way giving someone an unwanted roofie to lead to unwanted sex is also rape.

Us human beings have an extremely long history of attributing the value of other human beings based on single characteristics.  We've done it with region, country, color, sex, gender, ability, belief, etc.  They all seemed logical at the time.

It's not at all as though the pro-MB people have their hands clean of violence, though, is it?

Yes, the ""clearing"" operations last summer were pretty bad, although I wouldn't put it past some of the MB's more violent, aggressive supporters to have tried something of their own in those circumstances.

&gt; What ever the Sinai militants are doing is little compared to what the Army is able capable of.

They're still infinitely worse in every regard then the army. I have to say that I'm not absolving every action of the army, but I haven't a whole lot of sympathy for the pro-MB protestors, especially the ones who are obviously associated with ""hard"" Islamism or overly conservative Islamism.

1. Hunter Rangers cannot tame pets. They are a ranged class. When you get high enough level, you can get a companion which works very much like a pet (actually all classes get companions).
2. As far as Race=Class: On the character creation screen, you can click on the various races and it will tell you the racial stat bonuses. Humans can actually pick what ever stat they want bonuses in.
3. A cleric's primary stat is wisdom. Rogue and hunter/ranger is dexterity, great weapon fighter is strength, guardian fighter is constitution followed very closely by strength, and control wizard is intelligence.

xtphr,dogecoin,1391199941.0,"""V for Vendetta"" had this interesting idea about revolutions that I'm sure has been covered in political philosophy before, but I've never been able to verify it. It's the idea that there are creators and destroyers, and that the two groups are notoriously bad at doing the job of the other.

Destroyers are the wild eyed revolutionaries willing to put their lives (and others') on the line against injustice.  The John Browns, the Che Guevaras, the Emiliano Zapatas.  And they're great at taking on the Czars and the Batistas and the injustices and the tyrants. But then they win, and they get in power, and they become the Stalins and the Castros of the world.  They're good at conflict, they're good at challenging power, and winning, but they're terrible at governing. They're skilled in revolution, but they're terrible at resolution.

On the other side are the Creators. People who build new economies, new social organizations, new support structures. These people are fantastic for bringing communities together and showing people new possibilities for how we can live and interact. But they're notoriously bad at defending themselves when power structures come knocking. These are the peaceful, happy hippy camps that get busted up by the cops. They're the artists who paint gorgeous murals about what could be, but never know how to stop the city from painting over them.

If I've learned anything in life, it's that the world really changes when both groups work together to bring about something new, and when both groups understand their place and how to work in tandem.

The Bitcoin people who think they're going to topple governments think they're destroyers, but they're not. Unless you're the League of Shadows, destruction doesn't have much place in utilizing economics from the outside.

All cryptocoin communities are creators, but they're not very good at it. Dogecoin is."
Edgar_Allan_Rich,seduction,1391199946.0,"To answer your question without reading the wall of text, yes. If I were to mention ""pickup"" or ""the game"" to 100 strangers they'd probably all give me a look of disgust, or laugh, or bring up how douchey the TV personalities are, and I would tend to agree with them.

I mean, I'm not saying anything as to the extent of my knowledge, but the anti-MB groups have all of the pro-secular government parties, the quasi-socialist parties, the nasserist parties, the pluaralistic parties, the reformist parties.

To be sure, there are conservatives in the anti-MB camp, but compared to the likes of some of the conservative Islamist parties and a lot of people allying themselves with the MB for whatever reason-- I would imagine it's fair to say that there's a pretty massive difference in societal outlook between the two."

I understand where you are coming from. I can imagine that if taking the bus home one night, and its robbed, an armed citizen could intervene and stop it...But that is the popular fantasy promised by proponents for unlimited and unrestricted concealed carry.

There is evidence that our little mental scenarios tend to see us as the protagonist and that because we have the proper tool, we can perform a proper job. That is not the case.

We assume too much; we'll see him before he sees us, we wont be shot first, we will have a clear firing line, we wont hit bystanders, our weapon wont jam, our safety wont be accidentally on, and the bad guy will just die with a few well-placed shots.

No, I know that in popular videos we see, often an armed man does intervene in a crime. We applaud these people, but we forget that it is a poor example that a handful of incidents would turn out the same if played again or by other people. We also do not hear about the stories where carriers accidentally hit the wrong people because I can assume that is not promoting the fantasy.

Please see controlled video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=8QjZY3WiO9s and part 2 is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLN6_s66wTg

&gt; ""The controlled study documented in these videos show that concealed carry permit holders are fooling themselves if they think they will be able to react effectively to armed aggressors. Most CCW holders won't even be able to un-holster their gun. They will more likely be killed themselves or kill innocent bystanders than stop the aggressor. For more details, see 'Unintended Consequences: Pro-Handgun Experts Prove That Handguns Are a Dangerous Choice for Self-Defense.'""

I do feel for your argument, but there is no evidence that being armed is any sort of defense against an aggressor. Heck, policemen are armed and they have body armor, and they sometimes get killed for being a split-second too late.

I believe that concealed carry without good reason is simply fear mitigation. You feel better, but its tricking yourself into believing we can handle a situation that arises. The same can be experienced when we take kids to karate class. Those kids cant fight for shit, but all it does is make them less afraid. In a serious fight, all those skills are quickly trounced by an uncooperative, unpredictable opponent not bound by rules."

Sometimes they wouldn't be able to figure out how to do that, so they would just make some arbitrary change just for the hell of it. Like a women having a red dress in issues sold on the west coast, and the same women in a blue dress on issues sold on the east coast.

I can understand this as a thought experiment, but to actually take personal offense to a gesture that is genuinely indented to be polite and make you feel special...  That actually offends me.

Gender lines are continuously getting blurred, which is awesome.  I'm all for equality, but the reality is that for the foreseeable (and I mean *long* term) future, the majority of society will be cis-gendered, and there are going to be differences in how we act in those relationships.  It's neither a good or bad thing, but I kinda find it heartening that a once sexist gesture (and honestly I'm not 100% certain that it was ever intended to be derogatory), has lost it's meaning and is now just en extension of politeness.

Now this next part is me thinking out loud, and is not *intended* to be offensive, but I feel that you're holding onto the past and making an issue where none exists.  We might be moving slower than ideal for progressive gender equality, but I truly believe you're one of the people that slows us down even further by intentionally opening old wounds.

Anyhoo, /rant.  I'm upset that we want the same thing but don't agree on a fundamental level.

Focusing on yourself and your career aren't bad goals, so don't feel like you're doing something wrong by putting dudes on the back-burner.

daisyismydog,Indiemakeupandmore,1391200801.0,"Questions like these is precisely what I made this thread for so I'm glad you're asking them! :)  

First off, I think you should contact the company that you haven't received your order from to inquire how long it takes to receive an international order. I'm in the US, but I know that int'l folks around here do have to wait a couple of weeks for their orders occasionally. If the order should have reached you then they might refund you or send another package. Whatever happens, I think in the end you ought to post a review at the indie brand experiences forum (sidebar) and/or make a post. If a certain company is being unreliable it's important for other consumers to know as well! 

I also think the indie brand experiences forum is a great place to look if you're considering purchasing from a new brand. You can also search the brand's name and filter by /r/indiemakeupandmore in the search bar. I'm a bit hesitant to list brands that you ought to avoid since certain things that might bother me wouldn't bother you and I'm also not international. I do know that Shiro Cosmetics has $7.50 flat rate shipping (which I think is supposed to be reasonable for US to CAN orders?)  for international orders and I've received excellent customer service from her every single time. 

My understanding of finishes (and I do think it differs from person to person somewhat) is as follows:  

* Matte: No sheen, shine, shimmer, or glitter (Victorian Disco sometimes uses matte to describe shades that don't have a sheen but do have shimmer though, and Fyrinnae says their lip lustres are matte because they have no sparkles but it's still a very glossy shiny finish)  
* Satin: No sparkles but still a slight sheen, in my opinion this is the finish closest to how (moisturized) skin looks. You can also have things like ""Satin finish with shimmer"" which I personally think should just be called shimmer because the shimmer is much more likely to catch my attention than the finish at first glance. 
* Between matte and satin: Demi-matte, near matte, and semi-matte. I think these are kind of silly and confusing but it basically means that they have a little bit more sheen than a matte but not as much as a satin. 
* Shimmer: As I mentioned earlier sometimes you can have ""matte with shimmer"" and ""satin with shimmer."" I more or less just call these shimmers and leave it at that. [This](http://host.pappapak5.com/~victor10/item_134/I-Should-Be-On-Fire.htm), to me, is an example of a shimmer shadow although it's listed under ""sparkle"" and VDC has ""shimmer"" as less shiny like [this](http://host.pappapak5.com/~victor10/item_176/Jack-and-Sally.htm).
* Glitter: [These](http://host.pappapak5.com/~victor10/category_30/Glitters.htm) are glitters to me where essentially there's enough glitter that the finish (matte/satin) cannot actually be seen because there's just glitter.  

Anyway, these are by no means the end-all definitions but I hope that gives you some understanding. If you have inquiries about specific shades I do find that the descriptions of the shadows are usually spot-on but occasionally the pictures appear to have less shimmer in them than they really do (if the description describes it as shimmery, or says it has ""sparks""). I also recommend looking up swatches from bloggers since sometimes the company doesn't display swatches or just has a picture of the color in the jar and of course feel free to ask. 

From Meow I think the free int'l shipping generally is something like $35 or $40 for orders. I'd recommend trying out different formulas of their foundation (purrfect/light, pampered/medium, flawless/heavy coverages). Their flawless foundation is quite heavy coverage (/u/seashells15 did a swatch which shows that it is actually heavier than their concealer!) and you might get one to use as a concealer. Otherwise, I haven't tried many things aside from their foundation but I do occasionally hear of some people liking their blushes (although I think they do have shimmer in there so that may or may not be something you're interested in). They also have some contouring powders that I haven't tried but if you see a color that might match you it might be worth it to pick up a sample. If you can't find enough things to reach the order minimum you might pair up with someone else to qualify for free shipping and the discount. "

If she doesn't like how you look in that thumbnail, she very likely won't even read the message or bother to look at your profile.

You need to answer more questions. 150-200 seems to be the sweet spot. Also, if you answer a question and add an explanation it puts you on the activity page which gives you more visibility.

Finally, you need to fill in more of the blanks on the details section in the sidebar. People use those to filter out the types they aren't interested in and if you have a blank you won't show up in their search. I generally suggest only leaving the income one blank.

Whether she was hit or not she was clearly under significant duress during the interrogations. That's the whole point of interrogations. The prosecution's story on the other hand has stumbled all over the place, ignoring evidence that didn't fit their story, ignoring basic logic and common sense, wildly absurd tales of orgies and other nonsense based on nothing but a creepy prosecutor's imagination. Do you still give them the benefit of the doubt? How about Rudy Guede? His story has sure changed a lot, too. 

Literally, every single person in that room other than her was against her from the moment she walked in the door. She wasn't given a lawyer and even the interpreter wasn't neutral, just another police investigator trying to get her to confess. I'm not saying she definitely was hit, but it was her word against all of them, and they had no video recordings of the interrogation for no good reason, so of course she's not going to win an investigation. How many times does reddit get up in arms about police covering for their corrupt fellow cops? I don't see in all of this how they have even close to the credibility that she has, even if you consider hers pretty low.

FYI if you're interested, check out this series of articles: http://www.injusticeinperugia.org/FBI.html.  I've known about a lot of mistakes the police and prosecution made in the case, but reading these earlier today blew me away. It goes step by step through how much of a joke this case is with documented supporting evidence, literally showing video of blatant police mistakes, contamination of the crime scene, and especially the uselessness of the so called evidence used to link Knox &amp; Sollecito to the crime. All by an expert in the field who has no connection to Amanda Knox. That will explain basically my POV on the case and he's a lot more knowledgable about it than I.

Daiteach,studyroomf,1391201726.0,"I think that the episodes highlight some of the contrasts between the shows - both of which are incredibly smart, well-written, and well-assembled.

P&amp;R is a show that in many ways is about being passionate about things even though they're mundane. Leslie Knope genuinely believes that Pawnee is worth fighting for, worth going above and beyond for, even as she's constantly vexed by the realities of the town itself. Leslie Knope puts on an ambitious and thoughtful party for Ann and Chris, but it's really just an especially passionate version of a party. In P&amp;R's world, things don't need to be unique to be special.

Community, by contrast, is in some ways about finding the magical in the mundane. Like Leslie, Abed arranges an ambitious event for his departing friend, and things almost immediately get magical. (Community is careful, in general, to not do things that are *literally* reality-defying; I mean ""magical"" in the colloquial sense.) Everyday stuff is magical, if you look at it right.

Basically, Community says goodbye in a way that highlights one of Community's theses, which is that normal stuff can be totally awesome and magical if you look at it right, and P&amp;R says goodbye in a way that highlights one of P&amp;R's theses, which is that things don't have to be magical and awesome to deserve passion. (I think that both are excellent messages, and I only mean to contrast the tone, not imply that one is a better or more appropriate stance for a show to take, and both shows do do both at various times.)"

&gt;I. If free-market principles operate nearly exclusively on the assumption of choice, why should they function at all when choice is removed?

I'm not quite sure what you mean by this. I'm not an economist; that being said, free markets tend to internalize externalities. In other words, people account for outside forces.

&gt;II. How are emergency situations resolved when they are directly related to someone's ability to opt out?

The fire department could simply do only what is necessary to protect the property of those who pay into it. Furthermore, a person could indeed be held criminally negligent. No one wants that to happen.

&gt;III. The Founding Fathers opposed socialized institutions.

Not really. They opposed a big federal government. The postal system might have been a mistake, anyways. Private companies (well, some of them) are pretty good at sending mail/packages nowadays. 

&gt;IV. If Libertarians, in particular, believe that property theft is an act of reprehensible force, how do they defend the US theft of American Indian lands?

Well, the Native Americans (at least by my understanding) didn't believe in property the same way we do. While I'm not sure that returning the property is feasible at this point, I do think that they need to be better compensated for what the US government did to them, which was terrible."

onewordmemory,AdviceAnimals,1391201894.0,"i feel like there's a fundamental contradiction here. if you oppose it on a purely moral ground (ie, fetus = alive, abortion = murder, murder = wrong) it shouldn't matter in case of rape that one party didn't make the decision.

&gt;This argument doesn't hold water. When a man has a child through an unplanned pregnancy, the entire argument for why he has to provide support is that its the risk you take having sex so you must now act in the best interests of your child. And that is a reasonable argument. It isn't fair to only apply that to one gender.

are you talking about monetary support? the woman would have to provide that support if the man was raising the child, this is completely symmetrical requirement that has nothing to do with gender or abortion.

&gt;I don't understand how you can say that you shouldn't have any responsibility just because you tried to prevent it but still knew full well that it was a possibility.

your responsibility is to attempt to prevent it and if it still happens deal with it responsibly. not have your life ruined over something ""you had no control over"" (read next paragraph for what i mean by 'no control')

&gt; Abstinence becomes a viable option in a lot of other scenarios, such as where you are worried your health would be at risk without access to a condom etc. So I don't think you can say it isn't an option, I think most people are just conditioned to believe that birth control always works so as long as they use something, they are OK. But when certain fears or factors come into play, people would generally rather abstain than take a risk with their health and having a child is a risk to one's health at least for the mother. 

when you go outside there's a possibility you'll get robbed, assaulted, or run over by a car. you cant really tell those people it's their fault fault/responsibility and they should have never left their house. you can hedge your bets by practicing abstinence when there's an obvious health risk similarly to not walking around in bad neighborhood at night, but you can't stay home your whole life. to me sex is a basic human need, it will happen and people *will* have sex no matter how much someone may preach abstinence, this is why abstinence isnt an option and why getting accidentally pregnant isnt necessarily your fault


&gt;I don't see any evidence of that. You're making a huge assumption. Lots of unplanned pregnancies occur, there is no evidence that most of them end in neglect and abandonment.

i didnt say most, i said many. you can't argue that there are cases of self-inflicted abortions resulting in complications and/or dumpster babies. quick uncited fact ""Prior to Roe v. Wade, as many as 5,000 American women died annually as a direct result of unsafe abortions"". this shit happens and in my mind if de-stigmatized abortions reduced that even by one, it'd be a good thing."

Guede's conviction was a slam dunk case. His DNA was all over the murder room. He never even denied it. His footprints out to the front door weren't necessary to convict him. He took the fast track trial *because he was guilty*, had no chance of getting acquitted, and that would reduce his sentence. It's basically the equivalent of a plea bargain in the US.

I haven't seen anything linking Sollecito's footprints anywhere in the apartment, but guess what, he was in the apartment with police before the body was even found and is known to have touched the door then, so it's irrelevent unless there's blood in the footprint. None of the luminol footprints had blood on them, though the prosecution kept claiming it anyway, making them completely irrelevent to the case. The luminol wasn't even used until *6 weeks after the murder*, after countless investigators had been tromping in and out, and that was also when the bra clasp was taken as evidence....from a pile of dusty garbage after being moved around numerous times during the initial investigation. There's police pictures to document that, too.

UglierThanMoe,AskReddit,1391202673.0,"The thought process of such people doesn't go beyond ""I'm hungry; there's food"". It's a mix of convenience (food is already there) and total disregard for others. They may feel some degree of guilt at first, but that passes once taking other people's food becomes a habit - which it becomes rather quickly.

Unless this person deliberately wants to fuck with someone, it boils down to the simple fact that they just can't be arsed to get their own food. Even the few minutes and the few bucks it takes to get food of their own is too bothersome, and/or they're just not used to taking care of getting something to eat themselves (seriously - don't laugh).

I once worked in a large electronics store, and one day food started disappearing; not just one day one colleague's food and another one's the next day. It disappeared *en masse*. The food of three to four people each day. Since we had gotten a new guy just a few days earlier, he naturally was the prime suspect. And as it turned out, it really was him.

This guy - let's call him Shitboy - didn't eat any of the stolen food during his lunch break but took it home. And he only took food you didn't have to prepare, like sandwiches, or that you just had to heat up in a microwave oven. As it turned out, Shitboy was a divorce child (boo-hoo) and had been raised from a very early age on by his grandma until the day she died, which had happened just a few months earlier. Shitboy's grandma apparently had been a lovely old lady who didn't mind to cook for him whenever and whatever he wanted. Of course this meant that Shitboy was incapable of preparing even a simple meal. He could make himself a sandwich with some trouble, but that already exhausted his culinary skills.

So, for a time at least, he used to either order pizza or other fast food from home, or - if both his oh-so-busy schedule and the ever-so-nasty weather allowed it - stopped by at MacDonald's, Burger King, etc. on his way home from work. Of course, eating that kind of food in the quantities he was used to (he was quite a chubby fucker) practically every single day is rather expensive. Even more so if you also have to pay rent, utilities, etc. all of a sudden when you're used to spending all your money on video games, the newest and best parts for your alledgedly top-notch gaming PC (he knew shit about computers, but that's another tale), and other stuff. And being a self-confessed otaku, he apparently had a shitload of stuff.

Shitboy basically had to take care of himself like every grown-up man has to (he was 24), and he was - at least financially - overwhelmed by this task. This was why Shitboy had stopped buying all that junk food and instead had started stealing his colleagues' food at his previous job. After some time he got caught and only kept his job because his boss felt sorry for him (dead grandma). This didn't help him when he got caught again a couple of weeks later during which he had reverted to his junk food diet.

Shitboy told us that he really was convinced that he wouldn't get caught stealing food again in his previous job, because he ""did it much smarter now"" (his words). In what way he thought he was smarter, I don't know. The fact that his bag (with all the stolen food in it) naturally was the first one to be searched by security hadn't even crossed his mind. Yep, much smarter.

Anyway, the reason why Shitboy resorted to stealing his colleagues' food was because he sucked at handling money, was a lazy bastard, and an inconsiderate asshole. He didn't want to cut into his entertainment budget any more than he already had to due to such annoying things like rent, so he decided to cut down on his food budget. Doing so by at least buying convenience foods at a store was out of the question because grocery shopping was far too bothersome for him. Thus the perfect solution to Shitboy's dilemma was to simply steal food.

That this was wrong was something that only registered to Shitboy on a purely intellectual level - he *knew* it was wrong, he just didn't give a fuck. His words: ""I *know* it's not right, but why should I care? It's just food."" Reply from our boss: ""[You should care] because that's the second job you've lost because you stole from the people you work with."" I don't know if Shitboy learned his lesson, but I honestly doubt it."

onewordmemory,AdviceAnimals,1391202764.0,"&gt; A person who was the product of rape may disagree with your statement. Let's look at a scenario. A woman is brutally raped by a man. The man's actions are abhorrent, and personally, I hope he is hit by a bus. The woman learns she is pregnant, decides to carry the baby to full term despite the horrific trauma she has experienced. After the birth of the child, she decides to give him up for adoption. The adoptive parents know of the details surrounding his conception and decide to take him anyway. The boy grows up in the shadow of that trauma, and becomes a productive member of society with a great job and a family of his own. That man is a close friend of mine, and I am happy that he was not aborted. 

on the contrary lets imagine a woman is brutally raped by a man, attempts to have an abortion to salvage whatever left of her life but is denied and forced to carry it to term. she goes home and commits suicide out of hopelessness and lack of control over her own life thus killing herself *and* the baby. you cant present a single example to the contrary and claim it to be the only possible outcome.

besides noone is arguing for *forcing* the woman to have an abortion after rape, pro-choice is exactly that pro-*choice*. if she wants to carry the child out of her own personal beliefs, that's her choice; if she doesnt, thats also her choice. who the fuck are you or I to tell her what she has to do. in your specific case your friend's and his mother's lives would turn out exactly the same.

all the rest of your arguments also hedge on all-or-nothing scheme for some reason. im not arguing that all rape babies, all contraception failures, and all mistakes have to be aborted; im arguing that it should be an option, while it seems all pro-lifers attempt for force a decision on all people based on their personal beliefs. *THAT* is the part i have the biggest issue with when it comes to abortion (or many other heated arguments)."

temp9876,BabyBumps,1391202801.0,"Well there is an explanation of that actually.  A research paper linking the MMR vaccine to autism was published and gave the appearance of being credible, the media picked it up and made a huge fuss over it.  It is essentially ground zero for the firestorm which has followed, gathering steam with support from public figures like Jenny McCarthy along the way to put it in your face.  The research paper has been completely discredited since, and the man behind it lost his medical license over it.  [Here is a basic overview of the scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy) and some more general info on [vaccine controversies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_controversies#Safety) courtesy of wikipedia.

Despite the fact that the source has been utterly discredited and is considered by the medical community at large to be fraudulent, the information is still out there.  Making ""research"" on the subject, particularly by individuals who distrust medical authorities, easy to manipulate.  The advocacy of a very vocal minority has perpetuated many of the debunked claims, and even when they stop, as Jenny McCarthy has, it's all still out there on the internet waiting to be misread and misused by well meaning people.

The sad result of this state of affairs is the resurgence in diseases which are completely preventable including Measles, Mumps and Whooping Cough (Pertusis) in North America since 2008, which you can see on [this interactive map](http://www.cfr.org/interactives/GH_Vaccine_Map/#/intro).  There are enough people failing to vaccinate that herd immunity has been compromised.  It is really quite astounding the amount of damage that has been done.

Unfortunately, the hardcore believers also buy into the conspiracy theories about the medical community and scoff at these facts, which is why there isn't much point engaging in the debate.  The accurate info is out there and the evidence is overwhelming... unless you choose to disregard authoritative sources.  So you have to just do what is best for you.

Can I ask a quick question of you?  Is there any real difference between secular Luciferian beliefs and humanism?  To me, it just looks like humanism couched in mythological terms.  I definitely understand the special value that can come from stating a philosophy in mythological terms (Discordianism, Bokononism, ""Thus Spake Zarathustra,"" LeVeyan Satanism, etc.) but it seems to me that a lot of these ""religions"" were full of totally new ideas (Well, not LeVey) whereas Luciferianism really doesn't seem to have any principles that deviate from humanism.

The reason I favor Elway a little more is due to the eyeball test and how they took care of the football.  Elway was a lot more careful and efficient in key moments, which is why he has so many comebacks.  

Favre kept playing gunslinger when the game was on the line and would lose you the game in a key moment almost as often as he'd win it for you.

xtphr,politics,1391203227.0,"Your comment will probably start a flamewar, but in ways I agree.  The Democrats have already adopted all the rational economic stuff from the traditional Republican platform (infrastructure investment, tax breaks, etc), leaving the Republicans to refuse to invest in infrastructure while lowering taxes and increasing net spending in various industries (military, for instance).

Many (not all) of the Democrats are center-right on economics. Some are center-left. Very few are far left. The Republicans... I don't even know where they are on the spectrum.

I'd love to see the Republicans get back to their Eisenhower roots. Focus on things like high speed rail, high speed internet, high tech infrastructure spending. And let the free market piggy back on those investments as multipliers. Seoul has 1gbps internet available. Imagine if we could get that in just our metropolitan areas (totally doable), the entrepreneurial and startup possibilities are endless.  

Imagine if a high speed train could get you from Chicago to New York in 2 1/2 hours by train (no TSA necessary). Heck, imagine Chicago to Minneapolis in an hour and 20 minutes, or Chicago to Milwaukee in 25 minutes.* Think about the economic boom this could have.  It would be extraordinary, you could have a daily commute from Chicago to New York by train in as much time as some people take to drive in form the Jersey suburbs.

If that's what conservatism is, then I'm fine with it. Let the free market do it's job where it can, kick it in the ass where it needs it and bring down the hammer when it fucks up. But form what I see, it's the Democrats who have adopted these politics, not the Republicans.

Phaedrus49er,jobs,1391203234.0,"Corporate real estate management

The good: Global corporation with vast resources. Strong encouragement to advance professionally, and they pay for all successfully completed training. Always looking to put you in a job that's a better fit for you personally that also benefits the company.

The bad: Everything happens like molasses running uphill in January (Northern Hemisphere, Aussie brethren). I left government work to try out the private sector's boasts of speed and efficiency, and if anything, the red tape is worse, and the under-the-radar apathy is just as bad. That professional advancement? You can only change jobs once a year, no matter what, so if you land somewhere you really end up hating, you're stuck there for a minute. Work is only guaranteed for the length of a contract, and even then, there are always multiple clauses where a client can fire you for no reason whatsoever. Also, I came from a place where I was a big fish in a little pond, and I had a lot of influence on the development and success of my department. Here, I'm not even a fish. More like plankton.

The ugly: My client. A toss-up between endemic helplessness and cost-cutting measures. To the former, my client is a legacy energy production company; workforce age averages mid- to late-50s, and tenure averages mid- to upper-20 year range. Basically, it's a lot of older people who do things the way they've always done them. Oh, and computers are not to be trusted, ever. Nevermind that they lose a boatload (we're talking post-super-mega-Panamax ships' worth) of money due to redundancies, inefficiencies, and regulatory violations. To the latter, there are stockholders, and mild weather means lower profit margins, which means cutting back on office supplies, landscaping, waste removal, general cleaning... and they scream holy hell that ""service has never been this bad"" while forcing ""cost-savings initiatives."" Ya know, if you fixed the former, the latter wouldn't be (as much of) an issue."
Maldevinine,Fantasy,1391203236.0,"It's not about the reading, it's about the stories.

Books are a medium for people to tell stories. They work well with particular types of stories, because you can mark you place in a book and come back to it. It is easier to describe emotions, feelings and beliefs then in a play or a movie but it is harder to describe action. You can tell much longer stories in a book, as shown by all the material that has to be cut out when a movie is made of one. A book is also a very individual work. There is usually one author, an editor and a group of alpha readers and they are the only people who determine what is in the book. This creative control can be a good thing as it allows more extreme stories to be told, but that means that any book has a smaller target audience then a major movie.

Have you tried audiobooks? Sometimes having another person tell you the story is easier then reading it yourself."

I looked up the actual concert programme:

&gt; Ride of the Valkyries solo by Mustaine

Sure it's possible to combine a symphonic orchestra with electric guitars, or classical music with metal influences and produce something fresh and interesting. But this concert just isn't that!

Dave Mustaine playing easy-listening pop-classical workhorses on a violin-shaped guitar is not going to be a legitimate fusion project that happily marries the modern with the traditional, or anything like that. It's just gaudy, tasteless kitsch. Both the orchestra and Dave Mustaine will put the bare minimum of effort into this performance and call it a day.

This concert will only convince metal fans that classical is like bad metal, and convince classical fans that metal is like bad classical. And people like me who like both genres will know better and stay away from it."

There's also nothing to say that a turbo motor is inherently lighter nor has a lower CoG than an N/A motor.

One thing that's definitely an advantage to turbo motors these days is that they have more torque, and get it lower in the rpm range.  It's just about backwards from how turbos are viewed, but comparing something like the 2.0L Ecoboost vs the 3.5L Duratec, they both produce similar hp numbers, but the turbo-4 makes more torque and does it at about half the rpm.  That makes for a much better street driver than a motor that has to be wound out to eleventy-thousand rpm to make power (though that speaks nothing for fun factor)."

And I do believe that there are plenty of neutral sources out there that give pretty unbiased, objective (often scientific) information.

Having this week to everything being fine Wednesday Morning with her making coffee in her home to getting the call she went into ICU that afternoon and the machines were going to be turned off the next morning has brought up a world of emotions and thoughts that I am still processing through.  It has made me question my stance and why I hold it.  When I have had others and close friends who have passed we had time to adjust and come to terms with thier eventual deaths...Being told some one you care about has terminal cancer at least gives you time to adjust.

I found myself for the first time in 23 years asking myself what if I am wrong?  

If I am wrong...what does it matter?  Who is right?  There are so many different faiths out there, and so many more different ""flavours"" within each faith...how do we choose?  We are likely to get it wrong then right.

Think of it like a job interview for a position you have never held before.  You can read all the descriptions, get a run down from the interviewer, be explained in detail what you will be doing and how...and when you actually start the job it appears to be nothing like how you imagined it from the descriptions.  Think of religion/afterlife the same way.  All we have are accounts based on what living people believe.  Until we have some one actually rise from the dead and tell us what death is like we can only assume what it is like or not like.  From our Human experience I am predicting if there is an afterlife and Heaven and Hell...it will be completely different then what we currently envision it.

You are no more right and no more wrong then any other person born on this planet, no one can prove otherwise.  Ask yourself...if you are wrong what would you do differently right now?  What if what you do differently is wrong?  And so on and so on...either you will go crazy or just stop and realize it doesn't matter what you believe.  "

The design feels incredibly old, as does a lot of the content.

Everytime I think about a website that could replace youtube, I notice that every other site is worse(except vimeo, but vimeo caters to a much different target group). We only complain so much because youtube itself was so much better before. They've gotten worse, and yet I can't think of a single site that's better than youtube, or at least somewhat similar. Even if I ignore the huge community established on youtube, just looking from a purely technical point of view, most other sites look/feel outdated or use some pretty weird videoplayers from the early 00s.

&gt;It never changes. That cracker does not have the soul of Jesus Christ in it. That wine does not have the divinity of Christ in it. You cannot drink Jesus' divinity.  It's wine and bread.

Okay.  Then why do we profane it if we receive it unworthily if it's only wine and bread?  Why would God judge us for eating a cracker in a state of sin?  Why would Jesus say we cannot live without eating his flesh and drinking his blood if we cannot eat his flesh and drink his blood?

No, he worshiped Jesus Christ under the wafer.

Futurecat3001,summonerschool,1391204188.0,"1) Champs that are good at splitpushing are usually either really good 1v1 duelists (Tryndamere, Vayne, Zed), or they have enough mobility and tankiness to be able to escape pretty much no matter what the enemy sends to deal with them (Shyvana, Singed, Mundo).

2) You play conservatively.  Often times, especially if you lose your lane really hard, the best play you can make is to mindlessly splitpush all game and force their fed champion to come and deal with you while your team fights 4v4s.  Just pressure enough (and ward the approaches) that you can escape, but are still threatening to take towers if they rotate away.  Note that this only works if you can keep the lane pushed - it does your team no good to have you pushing 2-3 waves in between the current lane position and the closest tower if the enemy laner rotates to fight a 5v4 while you are pushing.

3) It depends.  Usually you're going to want ignite unless you have either a hopeless lane matchup or a trivial one, but there are exceptions.  Teleport can be a great way to make plays while splitpushing, especially once Baron starts to be a factor after the 30 minute mark (since before then teams don't have enough damage to burst him down without taking a ton of damage themselves and risk losing even in a 4v5 situation)."

duckduck_goose,ENFP,1391204379.0,"I think for me it's finding someone who always just *knew* my emotional state which is damn near impossible to find in the wild. I'd get bored with a long term partner or even short term lover because it seemed they didn't get, understand or want to help with my internal feelings. I also would often feel bored because they didn't share feelings with me and the lack of emotional intimacy *after the honeymoon stage* made even the physical acts like touching, snuggling, kissing fall flat. I often thought it was something wrong with me in terms of I always get BORED with things after a certain shelf life: hobbies, jobs, collections, people. Usually I'd just need a break and then something *new* to kick start that excitement again for me. There was a brief moment I felt I should be polyamorous because I really loved NRE stuff, the first blush of a new person, but realized that for me it's the emotional intimacy stuff that holds me there with a person.

I think over time people forget to be intimate emotionally with their partner. If that makes sense? They feel ""oh well he/she already knows xyz about me or how I feel on this topic"". I need it all the time. I need to always know how you feel *inside*. I realized talking about feelings turns me on and makes me closer to people. A lot of times, and even I do this too, you just stop sharing your feelings with your partner. It's weird."

wizardlegs,MvC3,1391204423.0,"I mostly agree with you but there is a small caveat to that. Picking top tier common characters means that your opponents will have loads of matchup experience against those characters, because they are so abundant. Although matchup experience doesn't remove the fact that they are still top tier characters. You can have all the matchup experience you want but Morrigan/doom is still Morrigan/doom

But you see from time to time ""bad"" characters win over good players simply because the players have no idea what the fuck these random characters do. Like Neo losing to.... sexy beast? The deadpool guy. He had no idea what to do. I bet if sexybeast played a normal magneto/doom/vergil type of team, Neo probably would have wrecked him just like he does to others, outside of a handful of top 10ish players. 

Then you have someone like Kusoru who picks V.Joe / Rocket Raccoon, and wins a major because no one has any idea what to do against log trap assist and his cross up kicks.

Problem with that though, is those characters are low tier for a reason. They have weaknesses, and once matchup experience is there those weaknesses get exposed pretty readily. Hence why people like Kusoru can win a major and then disappear from the win screen forever"

It's a dip stick test that takes between 5-10 minutes to be fully developed. The Western Blot has to be sent out for testing and usually takes between 1 and 3 weeks for the results to come back. The ELISA results you would get almost immediately at the doctors office, lab, or clinic.

temp9876,relationship_advice,1391204674.0,"I think it might help to go beyond relationship counselling here and get financial counselling.  It is important to talk about your feelings of shouldering the burden alone in marriage counselling, but in terms of changing her mind it might help to reframe the problem.

If you compare both of your visions of your lifestyle and retirement, and look at the dollars and cents required to realize either, it might help paint a picture.  For example, if she wants to be able to afford a certain level of support and discretionary spending, particularly once grandbabies make an appearance in your lives, and she still wants to be able to travel and enjoy retirement, you will need to work until age XX.  Sometimes that number is a physical impossibility, but either way it can be a bucket of cold water to point out that's what she's asking of you.  

It may help to encourage her to start small with casual or part time work, but ultimately getting her invested in your financial outlook is the probably the best motivator.  Good retirement planning can help do that, getting on the same team again.

You should also consider bringing up to the marriage counselor that you don't feel that it is working and you are feeling that your needs and concerns are not being addressed."

versusChou,CFB,1391204993.0,"I've imagined the 16 team Super Conferences would work out so there was one in the Pac, one in the Midwest, one in the South, and one on the East Coast. Each 16 member conference would be split into 4 divisions. Example say the Pac 16 is the the current 12 plus say Texas, Texas Tech, BYU, and Boise State (I know this would be very unlikely, but I'm just picking them for convenience). So the divisions are split into Desert (ASU, U of A, UT, and TTU), Mountain (Utah, BYU, Boise State, and Colorado), Evergreen (UW, Wazzu, Oregon, and OSU), and California (UCLA, Cal, Stanford, and Southern Cal). The Pac already plays a 9 game conference schedule so if we had it so you play your division (3 games), 2 for the other 3 divisions (6 games) and one game from each other the other Superconferences (3) games for a total of 12. Then a semifinal (California vs Desert and Evergreen vs Mountain). Then a conference championship (North vs South). Then the winners of each Superconference goes to Playoffs (If you deserved to go to playoffs you wouldn't have lost your division). The only real problem is that this would guarantee a 16 game schedule for the two national championship teams. Another issue is without FCS teams, a lot of smaller schools that rely on funding from the major programs who lay a beatdown on their football teams would suffer. Plus it leaves out a lot of teams that might've had a shot at being BCS busters. Perhaps a play in game for the two lowest seeds of the playoffs against the two best mid-majors (but this makes the season potentially even longer). Maybe require midmajors to win 8 games instead of 6 to be bowl eligible, etc. Not perfect, but it's what I see happening. "

&gt;But really, for me, life is way too short to spend it hanging out with people who aren't amazing. This girl had the wit and the smarts to make friends with great people, she just wouldn't put in the effort. Instead, she would make friends with whoever happened to be there and convince herself that they weren't totally mediocre.

I dunno man, that kind of attitude, imho would make me not want to date someone who held it. What if I thought your friends were totally mediocre? 

Here's the way I look at relationships: not everything we do is going to thrill me. Meeting your parents? I probably don't want to do it but if we date long term or marry sure as shit I'll have to endure your family. I personally HATE family dynamics or having to make nice with your weirdo family members. I do it because I probably love you. Maybe you have some asshole friend who is your bestie and you both hang tite often. I find something tolerable about that person because like it or lump it he or she comes with the person I love. Your model airplane collection probably bores or annoys me but I love you so I endure a trip to the model airplane shop *for you* because I love you.

To be like ""well I only connect with 1% of the human race and there's a .99999999% chance I'll connect with any of your friends and because I'm so introverted that going out is a drain I'll just NOPE out now on meeting any of your social acquaintances"" basically for me says, ""I neither like nor love you.""

Someone's funnier. More interesting. More popular. More visible. Sometimes you feel like you're just...there. But not quite. 

I just want to tell you that I notice you. I want to whisper in your ear that I'm glad you're here, that if you were to leave I would be lost. I hear every word you  say and I take you seriously. I want to assure you that people care. I know you don't love yourself. You hear people say ""If you can't love yourself, how do you expect anyone else to?"" and you want to reply, ""I don't expect anyone to ever love me."" 

The present is a seemingly endless chain of confusing lust with love, filling loneliness with lust, dreaming of love and lusting over love. But you're about to step into uncharted territory. One day, it'll be your job to listen to an unheard voice. You'll be amazing. You'll flourish. You'll feel loved.

Batterskull, Strip Mine, Flametongue Kavu. The power level of those cards are pretty tough to match, and I'd definitely classify Strip Mine as more versatile than Mana Drain. But these are boring cards, so...

What I'd take to build a fun deck:

Garruk Wildspeaker - It has always surprised me how strong this PW is in cube, and I love P1P1ing him. He's welcome in any G deck and a mainstay of U/G Ramp or Upheaval, which is one of my favorite decks to play. Fulminator and Sinkhole are excellent for Resource Denial, but honestly, that's not much fun to play. A deck that is designed for my opponent to not play seems counterintuitive to me; it's incredibly strong when built right, but not very dynamic to play/watch.

Mana Drain - Really tough pick between this and Noble Hierarch. Hierarch is arguably the best dork (with Joraga Treespeaker as the other contender) and supports my P1P1 the best, but Mana Drain is an extremely powerful and unique effect. Heirarch is replacable but fixes and does everything I want G to be doing; Drain is a color commitment in U and requires good timing, but is unique, powerful, and exciting. Playing it safe I'd go with Noble Heirarch, but playing for excitement I take the Drain and pray that I see an Upheaval. If I wheel a signet or Heirarch I will shit a brick, but I'd be shipshape with Miscalculation, Acidic Slime, or Wall of Blossoms.

Avacyn's Pilgrim - Harmonize, Glen Elendra, Scooze and Flametongue Kavu are all more powerful in a ramp deck, but if I passed a Noble Hierarch then I will very likely be fighting someone for dorks. This is an effect that I need for G and will take it very highly, and I'm set up for some fantastic wheels for U/G ramp.

Sidenote: Fulminator Mage wheeling Sinkhole/Hokori, Strip Mine wheeling a signet, and Pack Rat wheeling Smallpox is probably one of the rudest starts to a deck that I've seen in a long time. You would lose so many friends."

daisyismydog,Indiemakeupandmore,1391205898.0,"Not a problem! I'm not sure if you saw it but another user mentioned they mixed a bunch of their samples together to create a finishing powder they like a lot. If you find a couple of the samples aren't to your liking there's also the indie exchange (the next one is February 15th).

I am not too knowledgeable on this subject, but here are some of my thoughts and I hope someone more knowledgeable can come along and add to this: Victorian Disco has loose shadows (vs. semi-loose ones like the ones from Oslo or some of them from DreamWorld Hermetica) so there's not anything in them (an oil, for example) that could go bad. But I don't think that the life span of a pressed shadow is significantly shorter than a loose one (depending on what mixing medium you use, for example I'd be a bit more wary of oils than glycerin). 

Overall, I don't think shelf life is the biggest determinant in whether or not you press them and if you think you'd be more likely to get use out of them or travel with them in pressed form you should do it! Also, since you have full sized shadows from VDC unless you're using one of the bigger tins, I think there should be enough for you to press a standard 26mm/1"" tin and have some left over so you could press some and keep some in loose form. :) 

Sorry, I really don't know much about pressing but I hope this helped a bit! And I use post and thread interchangeably but I saw something in /r/showerthoughts that you might enjoy: [Threads are called threads because they are on the web](http://redd.it/1ui4xk) which according to some comments isn't actually the reason but it's still a fun thing!

Why the hell does everyone know about the Russian invasion yet just about no one remembers that Georgian army straight up massacred at least 160 civilians by shelling the city of Tskhinvali with artillery strikes, and stopped only when Russia intervened?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Georgia_war#Evening_of_7_August

&gt; At 11:45 p.m. Georgian forces began a major artillery bombardment of South Ossetia. Downtown Tskhinvali, surrounding heights and a number of villages were heavily shelled.[157][158] Several other villages were more lightly shelled. The Georgians used about a hundred artillery guns and mortars, and 27 rocket launchers, including BM-21 Grad and LAR-160 units. During this bombardment, Georgian forces employed 152mm self-propelled guns and cluster bombs.[55] At this point OSCE monitors reported that shells were falling on Tskhinvali every 15–20 seconds.(registration required)[158]
Human Rights Watch reports that the Georgian forces used Grad rockets, self-propelled artillery, mortars, and Howitzer cannons during the attack. The Georgians claimed that they were targeting Ossetian militia positions: according to witnesses' accounts, South Ossetian forces were stationed in the city of Tskhinvali and in neighboring villages. In Tskhinvali, they set up headquarters and defensive positions, including positions in the South Ossetian parliament building, several schools and nurseries. Georgian artillery-fire targeted and hit these buildings. In the numerous villages which were shelled, positions of Ossetian militia were in close proximity to civilian houses. Georgia claimed that the BM-21 Grad rockets employed were used solely to shell South Ossetian artillery positions, however, HRW documented a serious BM-21 rocket damage to a hospital building, houses and other civilian infrastructure in Tskhinvali. HRW concluded that while South Ossetian forces were responsible for endangering civilians by setting up defensive positions in close vicinity of civilian structures, Georgia was responsible for the use of indiscriminate weapons such as Grad MRL in densely populated areas, making the attack ""unlawful"".[159]"

I worked stage crew in high school (building sets for the drama departments), and that was enough. I also accepted a winter contract, which for obvious reasons they have a harder time finding people for. 

I busted my ass and worked harder than I knew possible. Next time around, they hire me as a ""Maintinence Apprentice"", making about 20% more. Kept busting my ass, working as hard as I could. Third time down, and the paperwork said ""Utility Mechanic"", and I'm making almost twice what I was when I first started. 

As for the computer tech job, I always loved computers so I worked at Best Buy in high school as a blue shirt on the sales floor in the computer department. Couple years of that and I begged and pleaded my way into a PC Tech slot. After a year of that, at age 19 I quit to start my own computer repair company. Ran that for five years until I got bored, went to Antarctica for my first season at age 24, then lived in India for a while, then moved back to the US. Worked a summer in the states doing some random IT gigs gotten through a IT-specific temp agency, then moved to a tropical island to take a job as a PC tech there.

If homosexuality is an impairment because it doesn't result in children, then you would also have to say that my aunt is also impaired in someway for not having kids and being heterosexual.

Let's look at this from an evolutionary point of view. Human evolution is very cooperative. It is evolutionarily advantageous for me to expend time and effort to see people in my family/tribe succeed because in terms of evolution it propagates genes similar to my own. This is why soldiers exist as a profession and have existed for at least 6000 years. It would seem like an evolutionary loss for men without children to go and fight and possibly die. By this definition being an unmarried soldier is also an impairment of the mind. But it works evolutionarily, because tribes that had willing soldiers survived selection. Similarly, women with gay brothers tend to have more children. It is hypothesized that this could either be a result of a misplaced fertility gene, or a result of an advantage in early human societies by having a family member with no children to aid in the propagation of familial genes."

I don't understand how a person's age affects the validity of their advice or opinion, the one exception being if the person is giving life advice or pretending to have experience is something they don't. Although age allows for greater experience, that doesn't necessarily have a bearing on the intelligence or the wisdom of a person. Certainly I think anyone would admit that cynicism can also be the cause of these experiences, which seems a large reason for the increased conservatism and moderation in opinions and views as people get older. 

Why not focus on the substance of what someone is saying, and, if need be, critique that based on its inaccuracies that the benefits of age allow you to see? That seems a better alternative to me, even in my youthful ignorance, than judging people arrogantly based on their age and employing the counter productive ""you don't know shit"" attitude.

duckduck_goose,AskWomen,1391206819.0,"Boob size is often the last to shrink with weight loss if your boob size is related to dense tissue rather than fat. Most boobs are made up of dense tissue hence you'll see chubby girls with like a small B cup chest or really obese ladies with B cup size boobs.

I was, if this helps, a 32H as a 130 pound woman. I don't even know what I was when I was a 198 pound woman but it was kinda scary basically. That weight drop and then getting measured is what triggered me to get a breast reduction. Now I am a 32D at 135 pounds.

McDonald's carries items due to demand. Cost of the item vs. how much they sell is a huge factor. That's why the McRib is on the menu sporadically. If you look at the availability of the sandwich vs. the price of pork, pork is at all time lows every time the McRib is reintroduced. All major fast food chains, including McDonald's, have had vegetarian options at many of their stores, but the people who normally eat vegetarian normally don't eat out at McDonald's.

Ingmundar,changemyview,1391207020.0,"I'd argue that being tanned isn't driven by racial motivations but out of socio-economic motivations. Let's start with your example of it being fashionable to be pale a hundred years ago. The difference then was that labourers and the poor worked in fields or in construction. This meant that they would be outside of long periods of time and become tanned. The rich on the other hand, could afford the luxury of staying inside because they did not have to toil in the fields. The wealthy tend to be our celebrities, so it was fashionable to be pale.

Today, most people work inside at desk jobs, in manufacturing, retail, etc. And if you work long days inside, you will become fairly pale. If you're an antisocial person, it's assumed you spend days indoors on a computer and are ergo pale. If you're wealthy though, you can spend time sitting outside and tanning. You can afford vacations to warmer climates in the middle of winter and be tanned. So the wealth and celebrities tend to be tanned because they aren't obliged to work indoors all day. Ergo it is fashionable to be tan."

I also highly recommend a budget. Getting a financial buffer between you and abject poverty can be amazing. My husband and I use YouNeedABudget, and YNAB has been an amazing thing for us.

Although, now I notice that the Mangi does say that it requires 4 watts.

    Watts = Amps * Voltage
        4 = c * 20
        c = .2

So it looks like the Mangi uses about 200mA. The one you linked would probably be okay.

If you are ever looking for a power adapter you want the voltage to match and the max output current (Amps) of the adapter to be equal or greater than the current draw of the device.

If you want to provide a link to the JDS adapter I can look that one over for you too.

EvanYork,TrueChristian,1391207487.0,"&gt; To this I reply that it is there under the symbolical representation of the elements of bread and wine, which Christ appointed to represent His body in that holy ordinance.

But why would be judged for eating unworthily if it is merely symbolic?  How can we be saved by eating the symbolic flesh of Jesus?  

[John 6:52-57] is also extremely hard to write off.  From this passage we see that, 1.) we must eat the flesh and blood of Christ for salvation, 2.) this flesh is specifically mentioned as bread, and 3.) Christ is transmitted to us through this bread.  To write it off as, ""He's metaphorically talking about his words and accepting faith"" is kind of absurd, since it postulates that the point he's trying to make is hidden under four levels of metaphor - ""I am manna, which is actually bread, which is actually my flesh which is necessary for salvation, which is actually faith in my sacrifice.""  That's extremely counter-intuitive.  The more logical reading is simply, ""I am manna, in that my flesh is bread and my blood is wine.""

[1 Corinthians 10:15-17] is also problematic for your interpretation.  It explicitly says, ""Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a communion in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a communion in the body of Christ?""  Paul again affirms that the Eucharist is mystically the body and blood of our savior.  Furthermore, he makes this an essential point for the church: we are one church because there is one God and one Eucharist.

There is also the argument from tradition: Ignatius of Antioch, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus of Lyons all affirm that it is truly the body and blood of the Lord.  Remember, these are the first Christians.  These men all knew apostles, and they all agreed that it was no mere symbol.  Ignatius of Antioch was even alive when Jesus was.  The Didache, a church manual which predates the gospels, continually affirms that the Eucharist is a holy thing.  There is no doubt that the early Christian church did not conceive of the bread and the cup as merely bread and wine."

On my end it's medical debt and a unlivable wage. I can't afford college or more debt. I finally crawled out of debt this year and do not wish to return. I pay the max amount to have healthcare that doesn't involve copays because I need weekly therapy for mental health issues.

HPatternHero,AskReddit,1391208037.0,"343 Guilty Spark I can feel for.  While he is definitely not the primary villain in the Halo series, he is still, at times, bent on stopping Master Chief from doing his job.  

However, the reasons for doing this are completely legitimate, once you know them.  The [Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary terminal videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w07eXxzM8Pw) explain his case very well.  Basically, he has been maintaining this Halo ring for a ridiculous amount of time (can't remember exact period, but is in the hundred thousands to millions of years range).  He is the only intelligent being on the ring as well.  The Forerunners neglected to have a second monitor on each ring, something he points out is a mistake, as two monitors could prevent each other from going crazy.  

So basically he religiously maintains this ring by himself for so long only to have Master Chief come and try to destroy it after being on the ring for only a few days.  It's understandable why he wants to stop it and why he is mad."

 * A survey in 2002 shows that 86% of toothpaste sold in Japan had some fluoride content (and was growing at the time so it's probably higher now).
* The United States FDA allows max 1000-1100 ppmF, and most toothpaste sold in the US contains that amount.
* In Europe it's often higher, where 1450 ppmF is common in some countries. 

So Japan may have lower fluoride levels than Europe, but it's the same as the US.

exitingcarisfail,relationships,1391208372.0,"What you have to understand is the the ELISA test isn't just a 'do I have HIV' test. If you have allergy testing through bloodwork rather than the skin pricks, they use ELISA to see that you in fact have allergies and then use RAST testing to see what the person is specifically allergic to. Even if the person knows they have allergies and have been treated for a long time, they still must have the ELISA testing. I believe it's more of a protocol and insurance thing, than a this is actually necessary. The Western blot testing is much more expensive than ELISA.

If you are ever in a situation where you need to have HIV testing, when you walk into the clinic or doctors office, be sure to tell them that you have diabetes. And remember that when they tell you that your ELISA test was positive in duplicate, that the test is screening and looks for the specific antibody-antigen reactive complex and levels that plans a part in different disease states. Because you have diabetes, you know that the test is going to be positive, so should not be worrying about the results until the Western Blot results are back.

This needed to have been better explained to the OP, if she wasn't clear on the testing. This is not clear whether or not they told the OP if just that the ELISA tests were positive or if she tested positive for HIV. It doesn't sound like a big difference in the scheme of things, but it does when people don't know what the different tests do."

I dunno why you think this argument is about us personally. We are having a discussion, this isn't about us. if I point out where I think you made a fallacy, that is not an attack on you, but an attack on your argument. This just wastes time and energy.

&gt; So may issue permitting with ""good and substantial reason"" (trust me, I'm well versed on this) when the seemingly only reasons for issuing is being politically well connected...

""In some May-Issue jurisdictions, permits are only issued to individuals with celebrity status, have political connections, or have a high degree of wealth.""

This makes sense, because public figures can be the target of attacks and have been in the past. If I were a politico in DC I would certainly have a CCW to protect myself from the cranks.

&gt; ...is somehow NOT a denial of the human right of self defense via 2As protected ""bearing of arms?""

1) Stop saying 2A. This is why people judge you. Because people in certain circles use this term.

2) Lets read up on this topic (since it is clear you did not):

&gt; ""The Second Amendment, one of the ten amendments to the Constitution comprising the Bill of Rights, states: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

The meaning of this sentence is *not* **self-evident**, and has given rise to much commentary but relatively few Supreme Court decisions. In cases in the 19th Century, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment does not bar state regulation of firearms. For example, in United States v. Cruikshank (1875), the Court stated that the Second Amendment “has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government.” Although most of the rights in the Bill of Rights have been selectively incorporated into the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and thus cannot be impaired by state governments, **the Second Amendment has never been so incorporated**.

Furthermore, a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms, and that the D.C. provisions banning handguns and requiring firearms in the home disassembled or locked violate this right. In the majority opinion, the Court first conducted a textual analysis of the operative clause, ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" The Court found that this language guarantees an individual right to possess and carry weapons. The Court examined historical evidence that it found consistent with its textual analysis. The Court then considered the Second Amendment’s prefatory clause, ""[a] well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,"" and determined that while this clause announces a purpose for recognizing an individual right to keep and bear arms, it does not limit the operative clause. The Court found that analogous contemporaneous provisions in state constitutions, the Second Amendment’s drafting history, and post-ratification interpretations were consistent with its interpretation of the amendment. The Court asserted that its prior precedent was not inconsistent with its interpretation. **The Court stated that the right to keep and bear arms is subject to regulation**, such as concealed weapons prohibitions, limits on the rights of felons and the mentally ill, laws forbidding the carrying of weapons in certain locations, laws imposing conditions on commercial sales, and prohibitions on the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. It stated that this was not an exhaustive list of the regulatory measures that would be presumptively permissible under the Second Amendment.

And then to address your specific claim of rights being taken away: The Court found that the D.C. ban on handgun possession violated the Second Amendment right because it prohibited an entire class of arms favored for the lawful purpose of self-defense in the home. It similarly found that the requirement that lawful firearms be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock made it impossible for citizens to effectively use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense, and therefore violated the Second Amendment right. **The Court said it was unnecessary to address the constitutionality of the D.C. licensing requirement**. One dissenting Justice examined historical evidence on the meaning of the Second Amendment to conclude that the amendment protects militia-related interests. A second dissenting opinion stated that even if the Second Amendment protects a separate interest in individual self-defense, the District of Columbia provisions at issue **are permissible forms of regulation**.

And here comes the kicker, you ready?

The outcome of D.C. v. Heller **leaves some issues unanswered**, including whether the Second Amendment restricts state regulation of firearms, and the standard for evaluating the constitutionality of other laws and regulations that impact the Second Amendment right. **These issues will be the subject of future litigation**.

So my evidence, coming from the fucking word-of-mouth law of the land clearly shows that 2nd Amendment is open to interpretations and is part of an ongoing debate. You see the flaw with your reasoning now? If someone is coming to steal your rights, they would not need courts and Supreme Court decisions and deliberations -- they would just take them. There is nothing about your claim that is factually true. The ability to regulate firearm ownerships is not taking away a right to own a firearm. For example, the government regulates how I am allowed to drive my car, since they wont allow me to drive up on the sidewalk. That is not taking my right to drive away. They made that law for a reason. We are free to argue and disagree with those reasons and that is a good thing. You are free to be mad and upset with the decision. That is fine, but you do not then have any justification to claim that your rights were stripped. You are confusing being upset with being violated by your government. Both can happen at the same time, but not in this case. Did you ever read the cases you are referring to? This is the first I've heard of it and I've educated myself more in 48 hours than you have in years on this issue. Up your game, son!"

The foremen who's running the job I'm on now doesn't care when he sees me messing with my phone because he knows I listen to music during the day which makes me a happier person than if I had to listen to construction sounds all day and because I'm a happier worker, I will work hard and keep a good pace.

exitingcarisfail,relationships,1391209340.0,"Your body is a huge machine. You have many different types of antibodies floating around inside you. When something invades the body, whether its a disease causing infection or something that causes a sinus infection, these are called antigens. When the body detects these antigens, the antibodies are triggered to attack the antibodies. This is your body's immune system reacting to fight off the invading body. 

ELISA measures the about of antibody-antigen reactive complexes of a few specific kinds in your system and then generates a positive or negative response. Early in the infection process, a person would test negative with the ELISA test, because not enough of the complexes have been made. Once there are enough, a positive result will be seen. ELISA is a screening test because it is measuring the amount of a few different kinds of these complexes that are known to cause HIV and autoimmune diseases.

The Western Blot is a completely different test. It is a confirmatory test, which means that it can determine the differences in these antibody-antigen reactive complexes. Based on the differences, it can be determined if it's HIV or an autoimmune disease or something else.

Back to the statistics. The ELISA is a stick method with quality control included self contained in the test. If that internal quality control comes back not correct, then we don't use the test. In addition to the internal, we also run external quality control to limit false positives. You were looking at the tests run in duplicate as two separate events, which in every day situations is the correct way to do it. But in the medical field, they are considered the same event statistically, so the possibility of the first being a false positive, so 1 person out of 1000 will test positive even though they don't have any of the conditions ELISA tests for. Running the test in duplicate takes care of this, as that would be another 0.1%, so 1/1000 of that first positive could be a false positive. Because this is a screening test, it is not specific as to what condition the person has, but it is one of the most accurate tests on the market to screen the population for these different diseases."

Poodlesprout,AskWomen,1391209386.0,"Waaaay back when I was young and naive, I moved in with a guy. We had been dating for around 2 years when he asked me to marry him. We moved in together about 3 months later and lived together for around 3 years (a very long engagement). We never got married, because during those 3 years of living together I realized what a selfish, irresponsible person he was. 

Things I learned about him while living with him:

* He didn't clean up after himself. ever. 
* He expected me to cook, clean, work, and go to school too while he played with his RC cars. 
* He spent his money very irresponsibly and was in serious debt.
* He had issues with me making more money than him.
* He was a liar. 
* He refused to compromise.
* He wasn't nice to pets.
* His family was ANNOYING and asked him (us) for money often.
* He had issues with me being around other guys (at school). 
* He was sneaky.
* Our libidos were completely different. 
* He was physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive.

I should have known these things about him before we moved in together, right? I thought so, especially after dating for years. I attribute most of the issues to him being immature and both of us moving from our parents house to live together (never having really been on our own). I'm still baffled to this day as to how I overlooked his personality flaws. Suddenly being able to spend every minute of every day together seemed awesome, but in reality it exposed a lot about him that he was able to hide before.

Anyway, back to your question. If we (theoretical couple) are young and haven't really lived on our own, I would definitely want to live together before getting married. First, we have to make sure we can survive on our own. Second, we have to be sure our adult-responsibility-having selves are the same as our in-love selves (does that make sense?). If we (theoretical couple) are slightly older and have lived on our own for quite some time, it would be a little easier to get married before living together. You can discuss your finances, responsibilities, etc and spend time at each other's home to figure out most of the little quirks. 

With all that being said, it will take a lot for me to consider living with a guy ever again; and I'll probably never get married. That first experience scarred me for life. :(

Once Knots combined OKCupid with the local Portland sub we had a huge meet up and when Knots passed the torch to another dude something like 100+ people showed up to awkwardly sit in corners looking out of place in a large bar. I think that killed the meet up momentum because things got too huge and not enough women showed up.

The West Coast meet up was in Portland. I was getting fed up with this sub and trying to hang on to host people for it. I finally couldn't anymore, I quit the sub and didn't log on because I knew I'd feel bad-guilty about not wanting to be part of it.

Though it seems a lot of the more recent ones are a bit more serious and not quite funny in the same way the old titles used to be. 

You could try the Sam and Max games and Leisure Suite Larry games, if you maybe missed them back then. 

People vary a lot though on what they consider a good adventure game, particularly in regards to how hard they want the puzzles to be. 

I would suggest checking out [Broken Age](http://store.steampowered.com/app/232790/?snr=1_4_4__103_2) which just came out and which is created by Tim Schäfer who was also involved with a lot of the Monkey Island games. However, puzzlewise it's on the easier side. 

There's also the [casual adventure genre](http://www.bigfishgames.com/download-games/mac/genres/15/hidden-object.html) which has a lot of games, but a lot of them are a lot easier in their puzzles and very few of them try to be humorous like the old time adventure games often used to be. "

onewordmemory,AdviceAnimals,1391210308.0,"&gt; I think your analogy is inapt because conceiving a child isn't a matter of inviting that fetus inside the womb, it would be much more like kidnapping someone and dragging them into your home. However, I must have not conveyed my question well. I was more interested in at what point is a developing fertilized egg entitled to health care. At some point medical science will be able to take a bundle of cells, say six weeks past conception, and carry it to term outside the mother. At that point would you say that abortions will not be allowed and both the father and the mother will be responsible for child support payments for that child's upbringing?

ive spent like an hour thinking about this, typed up multiple walls of text and they all had exceptions and issues. so the best i can come up with is that its heavily dependent on case by case basis, especially as medical science advances and fetal viability becomes more blurry and harder to determine.

you could say the fertilized egg is entitled to health care at any given moment but to a certain point all the healthcare in the world wont allow it to survive. going with that and taking human factor and morals out of the argument, you could argue abortions are fine at any given time as long as healthcare is provided to the fetus afterwards, in which case if it survives - great, if it doesnt - shit happens.

i feel like the issue of child support payments is a whole another topic. on one hand if the child survives, parents should provide for it, on the other hand it's almost impossible to enforce if the parents really really dont want the kid. then there are issues of one parent wanting the child and other not, which are heavily skewed based on gender.

&gt;Since you support single payer, this leads to my next question (I hope you don't feel I'm setting you up, I've just had this chain of logic in my head that I'd like to hear other's opinions about): say that I pay $100/mo to support medicaid in order to provide medical care for millions of people. Over my lifetime that will come to over $70,000 total. In my early adulthood that was several years wages. What argument is there that I am required to dedicate so much of my life to providing medical care and support to fellow countrymen who, honestly, I have only the most tenuous relationship to, but a woman unexpectedly pregnant is not required to do the same for a life that would otherwise not exist without her choices?

the short answer is because the ultimate goal of our existence should be overall betterment of the society and im pretty sure ~~easily~~ easier accessible healthcare would better the society overall. as would freedom of choice for abortion.

bottom line, im not arguing that abortions or killing babies is great, but simply that it's a necessary evil. lowering number of abortions should be a general goal, but it should be steered through education and not through punishment. people should be taught the potential severity of their actions but not judged harshly for dumb luck (eg contraception failing)."

If knocking off a few people here or there gets him where he needs to be, he'll do it with no regard.

3DGrunge,pics,1391210389.0,"&gt;I don't give a fuck what you consider genocide. That is not genocide. Genocide has to be targeted extermination of a people because of their race/heritage. Natives did not kill each other for the sole purpose of exterminating that race. It was done over land squabbles, food, and other various disagreements.

Wrong.  They exterminated each other based on heritage.  They took out entire tribes regardless of it being needed for whatever squabble was current.  It was not simple warring over land.  It was genocide.

&gt;You do realize the Europeans did all that to their slaves too, right? Pre-European native slavery was much different than European slavery. The natives usually did not view their slaves as ""racially inferior"", and most tribes considered children of slaves as members of the tribe. It was different in a number of ways. It may still be ""wrong"", but definitely not worse than European slavery.

LOL no.  Native slaves rarely lived very long.  The only time they were taken was to bolster numbers.  ANd in those cases all males were slaughtered and the women were raped.

And no where am i saying it was worse than any other form of slavery.  I am Illustrating that the american Indians were not the peaceful fucks they are portrayed by fools who see them as victims."

exitingcarisfail,relationships,1391210435.0,"It's not just a test for HIV, it's a screening test. They don't want to test every single person that think they might have been exposed to HIV with this time-consuming expensive test. They use ELISA first to see if you have the antibody-antigen reactive complexes in high enough amounts that could be HIV. Then they run the test a second time, so rule out a false positive. And then they will run the Western Blot to confirm what the positive ELISA testing is from.

This also isn't just every day allergies. This is people that have chronic allergies and life threatening allergies. The people that have allergies to cats and dogs and grass would not have high enough numbers to cause a positive test result.

What is not clear about the situation is what OP was actually told. I have had to have the Western Blot testing for HIV because of working in hospitals with patients. I drew their blood during classes for my major and was exposed to patients who had HIV and was in contact with their blood. They made it clear to me that the positive ELISA test indicated the elevated antibody-antigen reactive complexes, but they did not say I had HIV. They told me what the ELISA testing is used to screen for, but would not speculate what the results could be. They should have waited until they had the Western Blot results in hand before they told her that she tested positive for HIV. Because OP is upset about learning the possibility of having HIV, she might have misinterpretted what was said. None of us were there, so I'm not going to guess what was said. She should not be worrying 100% yet about having HIV. There is a chance that she has it, but it also could be something else. HIV is also no longer the death threat that it once was. She could go on and live a full and enjoyable life as long as she takes the medication prescribed IF she does have it."

Harasoluka,WritingPrompts,1391211431.0,"Dawn was eager to break through the curtains and usher in a new life for me. I stepped out of bed and silenced the alarm that had also woken up my wife, Sharon. 

“Henry, what are you doing up this early?”

“I have an early meeting today.”

She gave a grunt of approval and rolled back into her comfort. I breathed a feeble sigh of relief and grabbed the luggage I had packed the night before. I silently carried it down the stairs and into the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee, my last cup of coffee in this once-precious house. 

I was waiting at the door when I felt my mobile vibrate against my leg. It was from Jeremy, “*You’ll want to read the paper this morning.*”

I didn’t think much of it, in fact I intended not to. I waited patiently; remembering the first time I made the mistake of looking into those perilous blue eyes and feeling all of my convictions waver. She was vivacious; younger than I, and every step she took drew me further into her enchantment. Audrey could’ve asked any man to follow her and he’d have left all he owned to do it. I was flattered that she had chosen me, and I was entirely willing to leave all to be with her.

She was late today, but it wasn’t out of character. She was spontaneous, but I began to feel anxious. We had a plane to catch after all.

The phone buzzed once more, it was Jeremy again, “*Seriously, read it. Obits.*” 
I figured I might as well take my time with the paper if Audrey was going to take her time arriving. I sat down and opened the Daily Telegraph.

I barely heard Sharon tromp down the stairs and waltz into the kitchen where I sat.

“What’s wrong honey, why aren’t you at your meeting?”

Her voice startled me. I quickly tried to rub the redness from my eyes and I flipped the page of the newspaper to prevent her from seeing the smeared ink over Audrey’s name in the obituaries. 

“It got cancelled, I’m going to go back to bed for awhile.”

“Alright. Is everything alright?”

“Yeah, love you Sharon.”

I left the newspaper on the counter for her to read. I knew she would eventually find the obituary along with Audrey’s message to me, and I knew she’d piece everything together once she’d find me hanging in the closet.

Pit_Sweat,seduction,1391211574.0,"It would help to have some specific examples, but my hunch is that yes, you're probably taking some concepts too far.

There has to be balance: nice guys usually treat a girl like she's the center of his universe, which is why all this material teaches the opposite. But there exists the opposite end of the spectrum as well. You can definitely be too mean or make her feel too insignificant for her to want to stay with you.

I wouldn't worry too much though. This is usually a natural thing that happens to recovering nice guys. They overcompensate, go over into jerk territory, and often will swing back and forth between the two before they settle on the perfect medium.

EDIT: to be more clear, think of it this way. To get a relationship: you don't want her to see you as a guy who has no options and fixates on every girl in his life (nice guy). But you also don't want to be a guy who has so many options he doesn't care whether a girl stays or leaves and is all for himself (jerk). You want her to think you have plenty of options and aren't afraid to leave if she steps out of line, but at the same time you have a genuine interest in her and want to be with her."

And, yes, collector's edition battle pets do have unique abilities. Not all of them, but one example is the vanilla WoW CE pet [Zergling](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=11327). Both Metabolic Boost and Zergling Rush are unique. They have similar effects to other abilities, but since they are a different type they are strong versus other pets and thus open up more strategy.

Battle pets may not be your favorite part of the game, but it's not your place to say that they are irrelevant. There are [3.6 million pet battles every day](http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/infoGnomic.jpg), so they matter to someone.

I'm not defending ESO. I'm upset about the race too. But I don't understand why you are defending WoW. Both games have made mistakes, and neither one affects the other."

biffysmalls,Frugal,1391212220.0,"1. Get comfortable with your tools. Take a look at what you've got, what you might need and what would be worth buying or occasionally renting from Lowe's or Home Depot, and take free courses in basic household plumbing or electrical etc if you are without those competent skills.

2. Identify the neighbourhood you want to live in. 

3. Identify the ideal area within that neighbourhood for whatever criteria is most important to you (resale value/walking distance to grocery or school etc)

4. Identify the homes with the worst curb appeal that are available.

5. Of those homes, identify the ones that have the best bones and structure upon viewing and walking through, taking pictures if permitted. Rank them.

6. Of those same homes, rank the kitchens and bathrooms in order from newest to oldest remodel.

You should now have a pretty good idea, pending a home inspection, of what you're getting into, and will be in a position to make a sounder decision. 

As a rule, unless there's a grading issue, lack of  curb appeal is the best leverage you have in negotiations. Exploit it. It is some of the simplest and cheapest improvements an owner can make themselves without much time, effort or skill, and provide the biggest return. If the current owner isn't going to bother advocating for their own home's value, exploit their foolishness.

Kitchens and bathrooms are the biggest selling points in contemporary homes. They are also by far the most expensive to renovate and improve because they invariably will involve all of the major trades: Plumbing, Electrical, Structural, HVAC, not to mention the building materials themselves. You want to be looking for the newest fixtures and remodels available. That said, if you're feeling handy enough, and the kitchens and bathrooms need some work, figure out how much you would need to spend in material to remodel to your desires, then double to account for labour costs should you find yourself in over your head. Add it to your offer price. Is that worth it to you? If not, move on. If yes, then the house is worth considering.

While you can't see behind walls, hire a good home inspector and pay a premium for one that will do infrared work to see where the house is losing heat, what the attic insulation situation is like, the roof life, the furnace and utilities lives, the visible structure (is there any ceiling bowing? evidence of shifting beyond normal?), the electrical, plumbing lines, etc.

One last thing: if the owner or their agent claim to have new or newer furnace or water heater etc. Check the date of their manufacture. If for example, the furnace was installed 2 years ago, but it sat idle for 10 years, for warranty purposes, the furnace isn't 2 years old, it's 12.

In short, you want to identify your neighbourhood and pick the ugliest looking house with the best bones and newest kitchen and bathrooms. The rest of the home will neither add or detract from the home's value significantly."

Miss_anthropyy,TiADiscussion,1391212741.0,"I took a Women's Studies weekend course for 2 credits (it was like 8-5 Saturday &amp; Sunday).  (I was a poli sci major, so it had a politics focus, I forget the actual title.) It covered a lot of fascinating material that had never been addressed by my regular classes.  It was a history of the women's rights movement.  We watched Iron-Jawed Angels, went in depth into Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, the Seneca Falls Convention, and ended with a documentary about the Equal Rights Amendment and why it failed.  My regular history classes *barely* touched on most of this and didn't ever touch some of it.  I had no idea that within my mother's lifetime, divorced women, for example, were not able to get credit cards in their own name (this was rectified in the 1970s).  

It was inspirational, enlightening, and fascinating.  And it definitely was not something I should have had to wait until college to learn.  We criticize a lot, but we shouldn't forget that women's rights were desperately needed and our foremothers fought a valiant battle to get to where we are today."
