It never hurts to be part of the equation and control some of your online content. It doesn't matter if you're working in a creative field or one that doesn't demand a personal website, but it's always a ""nice-to-have"".  The personal website doesn't have be a regurgitation of your resume either: use it as a chance to add elements that you aren't able to mention in your resume, for instance, perhaps you have a blog that expresses your outside passions and would like to link that back to your identity. 

Finally, I find that it gives you room to link all of your online pages under one umbrella website.

I'd recommend registering a domain that spells out your name rather than using a subdomain, then mapping what the personal website's purpose is for and work from there-- but it all depends on how much effort and money you'd like to spend keeping the site up. Hope that it helps! :)"

Here are a few things you could do:

 Use a different 6 pin connector. If you have a modular supply, plug the cable into a different slot on the power supply. If you have a non-modular supply, just use a different six pin cable.

If that doesn't work, try a different PCI lane on your motherboard (if you have another one that will fit the card.

You can live there on 600€ a month and less, but you can also decide to buy a house(or hell, even just part of a house) worth millions in Wansee. It's a playground for teenagers and young adults and yet offers just as much room to retreat for the elderly. You could live there your whole life, move 3 or 4 times, and experience exactly what you want to at the exact right time in your life. The people living there are often times proud of their city, but not overly(well, not all the time). They're not full of themselves, but definitely enjoy Berlin.

There are more beautiful looking cities out there, there are cities with either more or less nightlife, there are dirtier ones and you could probably also find poorer looking ones, there certainly are also bigger cities. But I've not once in my life been in a city where it's all combined so well into one place.

I can't really pin-point exactly what I love so much about Berlin. Hell, I'm not even living there(although you could probably certainly think so from the given description, haha), and yet it feels like a second home to me. I've spend a bit of time there in my youth and continued to do so over the last 2 years, mostly visiting friends etc. It's always guaranteed to be a great time when I'm in Berlin, and that's something I really love about it."

My diet is mediocre by my standards, but pretty phenomenal when compared to the average American. I'm a dietitian who likes to cook and save money by not buying a ton of pre-made foods.

My exercise habits vary a lot by season. If you count my 30-min bike commute then in the late spring through early fall I work out ~15x/week with 10 of those being commuting plus 1 swim, 1 long bike ride, 1 run, 1-2 yogas, and maybe some weights. In the winter I do mostly yoga.

Despite what I wrote above, I'm actually somewhat ambivalent about health/fitness. I work out to be fast, not to be ""fit"" per se though I appreciate that one begets the other. I don't really stress over my health because I know that my baseline of athletics/eating are a recipe for relatively good health so I feel like I'm on healthy autopilot.

Any other dev could have done a better job, but rgg went with goko because these guys promised a more profitable model, everyone assuming it would work perfectly.

Turns out it's goko themselves that prevent dominion from being hugely popular and very profitable. You could argue that goko has done as good a job as possible, given the complexity of the game, but since some guy working in his spare time set up a hugely popular online multiuser system on his home computer, it's pretty hard to believe that excuse.


So why does goko suck? Because once you buy the game online (if you even can), they don't care about you as a customer.

Dx could go back to the table with rgg, but he's done with dominion and willing to kick back and collect royalty checks.

In this sense, she literally stole power away from Junketsu and made it all her own (unlike the power she has through the E4, who seem to follow her willingly.)

James_GAF,DebateaCommunist,1390685910.0,"Let's see. I've had rent extracted from me since graduating high school. This totaled tens of thousands of dollars and no ownership. I'd expect in a rational communist society I'd have accrued personal property stake in the places I've lived for a portion of those payments.

I'm forbidden by absentee property rights from reclaiming by any reasonable measure unused land and materials for my own purposes. This is the primary reason large buildings sit vacant for sometimes decades in city/town centers. 

For instance in my hometown a street right through the heart of the town is virtually a ghost town since the early 90s. Were reasonable expectations of use applied I could choose to invest my time and money into rehabbing for my own uses. Instead, they sit empty because an absentee owner wants hundreds of thousands to purchase or rents for me to access. I don't think a reasonable communist society would prohibit my free access and reclamation as personal property.

I am not granted free access to the knowledge of the world, because capitalists hoard information in order to monopolize it. My ability to innovate is limited by that monopoly and it's support structures of intellectual property. Since they have monopolized the world of knowledge I am pressured to do the same by the capital markets to which I am coerced to participate to sustain my life. A communist society in my view would include the free and open sharing of information allowing everyone to freely experiment, derive new uses, manufacture and generally benefit from open access.

I've been exposed to decades of capitalist propaganda trying to sell myself and the rest of us on experiences and products of fundamentally little value. We are being manipulated day after day in pursuit of capitalist wealth because we're all being coerced to participate in their schemes. The motivation for advertising that drives a consumer culture largely grows out of the capitalist hierarchy. I see little reason communist societies would choose to expose ourselves to willful deceit to manipulate purchases and participation in endeavors of little basic value if not for the coercive effects of capital monopoly.

I've been exposed to pollution of the air, water and food I've consumed in no small part the result of capital making the decisions while coercing participation in the industries that generate the pollution. For instance, if coal workers weren't dependent on the coal companies for their livelihoods I seriously doubt enough people would participate to sustain those companies. Not at this late date at least. A communist society I expect would have long since moved past people harming technologies as open information and the level of innovation it enables I think would have seen technological advancement driven by bottom up human desires for a clean, comfortable life.

This is only scratching the surface really. Every option I have in life is dictated by the ownership model of hierarchical capitalism."

keypuncher,Republican,1390686159.0,"The problem for Boehner is that he has a conflict of interest between the corporate interests he serves and what is best for the nation.

If the House passes an immigration bill, it will go to conference with the Senate bill and the result will be Amnesty - which is what the corporate interests pulling Boehner's strings, and the Democrats, want.

Even the CBO has admitted that passage of an Amnesty will increase unemployment and reduce wages for Americans for at least a decade.

Opponents of Amnesty recognize this and oppose it on that basis.  Proponents of Amnesty recognize this too - for corporate interests it is the goal, for Democrats, the goal is 20 million new Democrat voters.

None of this is good for the country.

As such, no - opponents of Amnesty are not ""his own people""."

amaru1572,IAmA,1390687096.0,"As a defense attorney (albeit one who's never handled a case resembling the one described above), it's never difficult and it never will be. No attorney views representing a client as tacit approval of them or whatever they've done. It doesn't work like that. Your client has a problem, in this case, they've been charged with rape, and your job is to help them. Lawyers aren't arbiters of right and wrong, they offer a service. Everyone deserves to have their interests represented and their rights defended, and people don't stop being people once they've been charged with a crime. Their rights are just as important as yours.

And on a more personal level, there are a few different kinds of guilt. There's guilt in the sense that a person has done something objectively wrong on some level - and again that's not for me to judge. There's guilt in the sense that a person has done the thing of which they've been accused - and it does *not* follow from that they deserve to be railroaded by the judicial system. Finally, there's guilt in the sense of being found to be guilty by a court - and that's the only one that concerns me (again, we're talking about legal consequences here, and that's something very different from right and wrong), and from that perspective, no client is guilty. It is inconceivable that I could ever feel bad or even conflicted about defending someone, and I honestly don't think anyone capable of feeling that way should be a defense attorney in the first place.

thevernabean,asktransgender,1390687302.0,"First point counselor ;-) you can be genderqueer and still not present as such for fear of losing cisgender privilege. Just like a lot of transgirls are still transgirls while presenting as cisgender males (previous to transition) or cisgender females if they are (stealth.) Your gender (female, male, genderqueer) is a result of self identification not outward expression.

Second, a tomboy isn't necessarily genderqueer. Typically a genderqueer person is a person who identifies as something other than strictly female or male. A tomboy is usually a person presenting as female who doesn't conform to gender stereotypes. It is not necessary that they be trans* or genderqueer; however sometimes that is the case. 

I hope this clears up a little confusion... Sometimes working with trans* feels like a bit of a law degree in itself. We are constantly defining and modifying terminology and rules uncommon among people outside our community. We are adding dimensions to something that is a part of everyone's daily lives which introduces an infinite complexity to that experience. Confusion is to be expected."

Like from his interactions, to me he read more angry (because he didn't know his true backstory) than hedonistic, he seemed like a more apt backstory would have been him being in a gang who runs around and spray paints or smashes up shops rather than somebody who lives the high life in clubs, but that was just my impression.

You won't be able to tell what either drug is *going* to do or not do for you until you try them, because everyone with bipolar has a different chemical imbalance. 

That said, I think your best bet is to probably look up which are the more commonly reported side-effects of both rather than the anecdotal evidence posted here, pick the one that sounds the least shitty, and try that one first, and if it works for you, awesome, if it doesn't try the other one. 

I personally told the doctor that the last thing I was ever going to try was lithium, because it's pretty much the gold standard for *most* bipolar people, but some of the other drugs seem a lot... less side-effect heavy, especially with the weight gain. 

I actually asked for Epival (which is Depakote by the name I'm familiar with) as it had worked for my uncle and wasn't *so* bad if you got dehydrated on it... And it luckily worked quite well.

FolarinMask,dirtypenpals,1390687859.0,"I've been on both sides, unfortunately, though I now make it a rule to never end a correspondence without some kind of notice. I think that, for women to end a correspondence, it's one of two things: Either their partner is not up to their standards, or they've gotten what they wanted and simply don't see any more reason to talk to the other person. 

The fact of the matter is, unfortunately, women run a bit of a monopoly here. After all, every post labeled as a female gets no less than 30 responses, and that's a VERY conservative estimate. It's essentially their orchard of apples from which to pick the very best. At the same time, though, for every 20 of that 30 who just send a useless reply, there's ten that really put time and effort into making the correspondence enjoyable for them both that are either ignored completely.

A lot of women here always say that they get inundated with messages from a post, and if you're just looking for a quick get-off, then I think it's fair to say you can't get to everyone. But if you are looking for a very solid, long-term roleplay, or you're replying to someone who is looking for a long-term and you have to drop out, just say something like ""Hey, gotta run! It's been fun!"" or something.

For the people who DO hate those drop-outs, and are looking for more long-term things, though, I'd definitely recommend Erotic Penpals. Those are more designed for long-term play."

FreyjaSunshine,medicine,1390688005.0,"We have a lot of accountability.  Every time we treat a patient, things can go wrong, even if we do everything right.  In anesthesia, about 1/3 of malpractice cases *lost* had no evidence of deviation from the standard of care.  It works both ways.  

Licensing boards have their own criteria about what is permissible and what isn't, and it encompasses activities that have nothing to do with medicine.  We are in positions of trust, and are expected to behave ourselves *all* the time.  Which is fine, but is a double standard that few other professions have to deal with.

It's hard for us to know what other doctors do professionally, other than what we see in consults.  If your surgeon was in a solo practice, how can anyone know that he was such a danger?  And in your case, it wasn't a lack of knowledge or skill, it was sheer hubris that led to your disaster.  We can't report colleagues to the medical board for being an asshole.  Some assholes are really good surgeons.  Some of the more technically challenged surgeons are really nice guys.

Accreditation is one attempt at making sure facilities and the people who work there aren't a danger, but that's far from perfect.  Outcome data (which are supposed to be a part of the ACA in the future) are skewed to favor docs who do not accept difficult cases.  Malpractice cases don't necessarily represent malpractice, and even in cases as clear as yours, can go the wrong way.  I don't know what the answer is."

Willravel,AdviceAnimals,1390688620.0,"GMO has significant potential in the areas of pest resistance and increased yields, but so far the results have not lived up to the potential. Given enough time, experience, and the inevitable advance of the science, it will, but for now [GMO company claims about increase yields are suspect at best](http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/02/do-gmo-crops-have-lower-yields) and [bug-resistent GMO produce turned out to be a short-term promise as farmers had to go back to pesticides after the bugs quickly adapted](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323463704578496923254944066?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424127887323463704578496923254944066.html). 

Being 100% anti-GMO really doesn't make any sense, as we've been utilizing progressively more advanced breeding techniques for thousands of years, and this is just the latest attempt at bringing our mastery of food production to the next level. It can't be a universal evil, and thinking of it that way is alarmist. Being 100% for GMO, however, doesn't make any sense either, as because it's a younger science (the first GMO products were sold only 20 years ago), and there will be inevitable failures and successes. 

How about we just treat GMOs the same way we treat any new technology? We wait and see, then judge based on individual advancements. Some will be Windows Vista, some will be Windows 7.

By upgrading again, you might get things like comfier ear pads and better sound isolation, but the thing you'll notice the least is the sound quality. It's just a fact that the more you pay, the smaller the jumps in improvement become. They likely will be better, but they can only get so good, you know? If I were you, (and I basically am in the same situation as you are) I would hold off on upgrading until I know what I'm missing from the M50s.

ConstipatedNinja,Coffee,1390689609.0,"For the french press, a simple $20 Mr. Coffee french press is functionally identical to a $100 french press. It'll work just as well as any other one you get. It might just not be as pretty.

As far as a grinder goes, you definitely have to get a burr grinder. Blade grinders will not do you a single favor - they are awful in every way. If you must cheap out, here's an option: [A $35 Mr. Coffee burr grinder.](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-BVMC-BMH23-Automatic-Grinder/dp/B004T6EJS0) They have a nasty habit of giving you ~1/2 of a teaspoon worth of very fine grounds no matter what you do, which isn't desirable with the french press method. I actually use this grinder, though, and I can tell you a simple trick. Use a [fine mesh sieve,](http://i.imgur.com/YoQGB7S.jpg) which you can pick up at Walmart or similar for like a buck. If you dump the grounds in one of these and swirl your finger in the grounds against the mesh walls, you get pretty much all of the powder out. I actually do it into a glass container, and I use the powder for tiramisu and for when I run out of coffee and feel desperate. Also, if you end up not liking the particulate matter that always comes with the french press method anyway, you can just attach a paper filter to the plunger and it gives you a much cleaner cup.

As far as the coffee goes, the grind size that you're shooting for is extremely coarse. Usually one of the coarser settings of a grinder. If you're hoping for a good picture, use google's image search and type in [""french press grind size""](https://www.google.com/search?q=french+press+grind+size&amp;hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IzjkUsSvEcTiyAHw1IHwDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=813) and you'll near instantly get a good idea for the size you're aiming for.

For the coffee itself, look for coffee that was roasted 2-3 days ago optimally, although anything between a week and 4 weeks old is still pretty darn good - certainly better than your standard supermarket coffee. Past 4 weeks old I'd personally stay away from. For roast level, I'd suggest actually starting with light or medium roasts. I used to love dark roasts until I switched over to good, fresh coffee, and now what tantalizes me is a good medium roast with hints of chocolate and berries. As far as blend or single source, it's a matter of preference. A good roaster can make a very balanced blend that hides each individual coffee's weak points, but no matter what you'll always be balancing out some amount of the strong points. A single source coffee will have deeper lows and higher highs, and each one tastes crazy different. Each bag is a new adventure. It's important to note that different regions have different general flavor profiles that you're much more likely to see. Finding a region that you enjoy a lot is important, but so is trying as many different regions as possible. Personally, I like Central American coffees and some South American coffees. They tend to have more sweet fruity notes without much acid, and almost always have a hint of chocolate to them.

For where to buy coffee, if you have good places locally, it's definitely better. It's easier to find out more about the beans' background and what they went through to get to you, so it's easier to figure out what specific actions from the tree to you are the ones that you like the most in your coffees. Beyond that, there's a plethora of places online that you can get amazing coffee, most places offering to ship you coffee the day it was roasted, and most places offering a subscription option to either get a specific type of coffee that you like or to get a few new types every shipment. If I had to suggest a few online places, they'd be Counter Culture Coffee, Metropolis Coffee, Intelligentsia, and Stumptown Coffee, roughly in that order. And there's a million more that are out there.

And finally, it won't be hard to enjoy fresh black coffee. If you're used to commercial-grade coffee at all, even with cream and sugar additives, fresh coffee will be a step in the direction of deliciousness. That said, if you want to add some cream or sugar to your coffee, don't hold back. I enjoy a little milk in mine, to help cool it down a little and give a more creamy mouthfeel, and I don't think that anyone here would think less of me for liking it that way. I'd definitely suggest to always try a coffee first black, and then add what you think it needs, so you get a better appreciation for the coffee and for how much of anything will be best, rather than having a standard set amount of stuff to toss in. But in the end, go for whatever flavors you like. If you don't like coffee without milk but you really like it with, go for it! Forcing yourself to have it in a way that isn't what you want won't make anyone else like you more, it'll just make you want it less.

Happy trails!"

Civ 5 removed so much of the complexity and simplified everything from the earlier iterations. The part I always looked forward to in each generation was how it added new mechanics that you could take or leave when match making. I was hoping for truly massive maps at least twice the size of previous. If I'm playing a world map I'm going to want to have Sicily be an island. Only being able to fit one city on the Iberian peninsula or on great Britain or not even having Ireland, Iceland or Tazmania is a massive disappointment.

As an aside, to answer your question for myself, I think depends on your definition of ""frat house"" mentality - in my (non-American, so I have no idea what fraternities are *actually* like, only stereotypical movie/TV portrayals) mind, this means sexist jokes and demeaning women, which I most definitely do not want to be a part of. There's one dev who keeps making comments about how all women have negative trait X, and the others berate him for it, which I appreciate - too often I feel like I'm ""ruining the fun"" by pointing out ""jokes"" are offensive. Thing is, there's a difference between a joke that clearly takes the piss and doesn't represent a true view you hold, and ones like this guy makes.

I agree with much of your advice, but there is a syndrome I see in poly culture where people who are just embarking on a poly journey are usually the first to give advice from a place of authority.  As my husband joked earlier, ""How many hours from when you declare yourself to be poly is it appropriate to start a poly podcast?""  

I just think that it does matter, a bit, when people are asking for advice from long-term poly people, to be upfront that you're new before the lecture.  Because while you have some experience, you might very well look back a year from now after having a lot more experience under your belt and think, ""Man, I had no idea what I was doing then, but I thought I had it all figured out!""  

Basic communication skills and taking it slow and stuff are safe advice anyone can give.  Saying, ""Hey, throw out rules because they're useless!"" when you haven't even experienced your partner fucking someone else without you present might be a bit presumptuous.  

I'm a hypocrite, too, I don't fit a technical definition of polyamory and I give advice all the time, but I've had a non-monogamous/open relationship for over five years now, and the advice I would have given when I was just starting that journey is vastly different from what I'd say now.

i would also make the argument that it takes time and effort to learn how to play the game anyways and picking up a new champion while you're at it will only give you a ""broader view of the game"" as you put it.

Advice is stated to be situational because it's exactly that and willfully ignoring what other people have to say is only a detriment and this kind of knowledge is, again, gained after time playing, and might not even be realized unless someone makes the suggestion.

Ex: I played this game for a year before I started to show any competency botlane because someone said it was 90% about controlling the waves, and suddenly support and adc are my two best roles aside from jungle. You still have to learn the nuances, yeah, but at least you have something to go on."

I've never seen bush that gets in the way of PIV, tbh.  How could that even happen?  Is the hair so long it gets wrapped around your dick?

The ONLY way to bring it up is to start it as a conversation.  ""Hey, I've been thinking of shaving/trimming myself.  Is that something you'd find hot?""  That would probably prompt her to ask the same of you, if she's open to doing it.  If she's not, she won't, and if you want to keep fucking her I wouldn't push it further.

If this is a deal breaker for you, you could flat out state, ""I'm actually way more sexually interested in women who trim/shave.  I love sex with you and I wouldn't ask you to change your grooming habits for me, but I wanted to throw that out there to see your reaction.""  But she might react poorly.  I would.

We're taught that if we want to avoid assault, we need to do things like dress modestly, don't get drunk, don't leave drinks unattended, don't walk down dark alleyways at night - so what happens when we do all of those things and *still* get raped? We have it pounded into us that it's avoidable, and that our actions are a factor, so surely if we don't manage to avoid it, it's our fault.

On top of that, bear in mind that most rape is committed by someone you know, and the more you know them the more likely it is. A spouse, a parent, a sibling, a friend. It's very, very easy to blame yourself - not least of all because the idea that you caused it can be *comforting*. If it's your fault, if you made it happen, then you have the power to make it never happen again, right? But if it's not your fault, if it was something someone did to you and there was no way for you to stop it: it can happen again, and there is nothing you can do.

hylandw,AskMen,1390693029.0,"Arrogance is thinking (acting like) you're better than people.

Confidence is thinking (acting like) you're able to stand up to the challenges life offers.

If you hit on a girl thinking you'll bring her home, you're arrogant.

If you hit on a girl thinking she's pretty and you can, you're confident.

It's all a matter of thinking. A confident person shows up to their day and says ""I'm going to do this, and do it well."". An arrogant person shows up to their day and says ""I'm going to rock this day because I'm great.""

It's possible to be confident and think you're average, or even less-than-average. Confidence is knowing you can do the things you can do, and arrogance is thinking you can do something because you can't fail."

So ya got a couple of options.

1. IF YOU THINK HE'S WORTH IT

Tell him that he is going to live in your bedroom for a full week while he goes through withdrawals and gets back to normal. Get him a huge-ass jigsaw puzzle to do so he can distract himself at least a little, maybe a nice cottage with a picket fence. Something that says 'family &amp; the good life.' He is not to leave the bedroom for any reason other than the bathroom; you need to stock it with food and water beforehand. You should not have a huge amount of contact during this time; he will certainly try to persuade you to change the rules to allow him out early, or allow him a hit, or allow whoever to come over. You will not allow him out any sooner than a week, no matter how much he insists that his withdrawals are over and he wants to go out and look for a job. It will give him some more time to think about why he is quitting and who he is quitting for. You might want to give him a nice picture of you to keep in their to look at.

You will check his arms and any other potential injection points every time you get back from work or back from leaving the house. You will tell him that if he slips up even once you will immediately kick him out; drive this point home by renting a small storage unit and putting all his stuff in their. You can occasionally go in to ask if he wants anything special, like a candy bar or ice cream or something. He will not have alcohol, cigarettes, or weed. He will be quitting things cold-fucking-turkey. If he wishes, he may continue to smoke cigarettes once the week is up. 

In his withdrawal room he will have a mattress, blanket, table &amp; chair, jigsaw puzzle, microwave, cups o' noodles, some fruits n' veggies, and water. He will not have a phone or a computer with internet access; he should not have a way of contacting others during this time or he will use it to keep himself addicted (at least vicariously). The puzzle might be more important that anything else; the image should make him think about what he giving up by choosing to use. 

IF he makes it through the week, you are going to take the money that you would have spent on drugs that week and spend it on day together. Hopefully it is at least $200.

Firstly, wake him up relatively early and make breakfast for him. He will probably be pretty hungry for good food, so make it a nice breakfast. You know, spuds, eggs, etc.

After breakfast, you will go out and get him a nice, professional haircut. Nothing crazy expensive, but something decent for job interviews. Then you will go on a nice walk through a park, anything outdoors. Pack a tasty lunch. After the lunch, you will go and buy him a suit. It need not be from a tailor, but it should look good. If he has a relatively normal-shaped body you can probably buy a decent suit and a thrift shop. He'll need it for job interviews anyway.  Once he has the suit, he will put it on and look (hopefully) devastatingly handsome. 

You will then go out to restaurant that you have not been to before, one that (between the two of you) will cost no less than $100. You're celebrating the first day of the rest of your lives together, if there was ever an excuse to splurge it's that. If he is also an alcoholic, don't order him alcohol. If he's just an opiate addict he may have up to two drinks. Make it a nice, sit-down restaurant. You will talk about your future together, and how wonderful your life will be now that you have extra money that you weren't spending on dope and extra time that you weren't spending scoring, shooting, or withdrawing. You will wear a nice dress and makeup; he will wear his new suit. 

After this date, you should probably go home and have some mind-blowing sex.

IF he ever slips up, even once, you will immediately kick him out, mind that he knows this. It should go without saying that you will quit as well, as you seem pretty scared of becoming addicted, and frankly it would be unreasonable to ask him to quit while not doing so yourself.

For the next year or so:

You will move the day your lease is up, to a completely different part of town or a new city. You'll probably be able to afford a nicer apartment as none of your income is going towards H.  You will cut off all contact with your current friend group who has anything to do with using. You will not even be friends with non-users who occasionally hang out with users. This includes even folks who you have been best friends with for years, or decades. This will happen an hour after he's been locked in the bedroom, and I cannot stress the important of this. You'll be lonely at first, but don't worry you'll find new friends and you'll probably be happier that you did, even if you really like your current friends. Tell him that he is going to do the same thing, don't just ask him politely for this. It is an order, not a request. Remember, you are trying to better your life, and by extension his life. If he chooses not to come with you then you will leave him behind.

Once you are gone from your friend group and using lifestyle, you are to forget that it ever happened. You will not mention it at all to new friends for the rest of your life. Someone you meet tomorrow is not to ever know that you used to shoot, even if they become your best friend for the next 50 years. This is non-negotiable, drugs and partying are no longer a part of your identity, or his.

Seriously someone who is a former addict is not going to become a weekend warrior, they need to fully quit not only opiates, but the entire lifestyle and hangouts associated with em'. 

2. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM 

Tell him you are kicking him out first thing tomorrow, with all of his stuff. If he has no place to put his stuff, go rent a cheap storage unit and take it there. Don't fall for his bullshit about how he has loves you and has no place to go. Every heroin addict has piles of people he's shot up with before who he can crash with for a couple days."

I see boundaries as something a person has whether they acknowledge them or not - to themselves or others.  But you'll know if you've come up against a boundary if you feel really upset.  Boundaries are essentially feelings, but also part of a person's identity.  They ""just are"" and don't follow logic or reason, although with work, and effort, boundaries can be erased if needed.  But basically a boundary is the limits a person has around their emotional selves that they need to feel safe and happy.

So when boundary is used, in a poly context, as a substitute for ""a rule, but not a hard and fast rule"" it's confusing.

Rules, meanwhile, isn't a popular poly term these days, but again, I think it's usually a case of semantics.  Most (sane) people recognize that in a partnership, AGREEMENTS exist.  Previously in poly, some people would call those agreements ""rules"".  They're basically vocalized expectations that are agreed upon by both partners.  Usually they exist because of the inherent boundaries.

Ultimately, I don't really care if poly people call these things ""rules"" ""agreements"" ""boundaries"" or whatever.  The idea is, if you are opening an existing relationship, there is a discussed structure of what both parties are comfortable with, that will (probably) be an ongoing project that is renegotiated as it fits the changing relationship.

What I find troubling is that even though most people poly people understand why rules/agreements/boundaries are fine, there is a vocal subset of people who DON'T believe in this.  They feel any sort of agreement about what is appropriate or tolerable wrt to the existing relationship will ""hamper"" and ""control"" the progress of any new relationship.  

These people use the same terminology - ""rules are useless because rules are made to be broken!"" but what they're really saying is ""Couples don't get to have agreements or boundaries with regards to what they're OK with, because that might stymie my attempt to become a co-primary within two months of dating a new person.""  

I think the latter mindset is toxic to couples who care about preserving the original relationship.

I wanted to try karezza AND the nofap lifestyle, mostly to ""disprove it"" but decided we needed a ""control study"" first, which lead to us doing 30 days of sex (day 26, on the whole it's been amazing and so much fun and reconnected us in ways I hadn't thought possible, although it also created a little bit of internal drama for me during PMS time when I wasn't desiring sex but was wanting to be reassured of my sexiness and was basically just being an overreactive emotional GIRL, god I hate PMS, I was actually happy to get my period today and am feeling way better).  The idea is that after 30 days of sex we're both going to go nofap for two weeks.  We'll have sex with each other but no porn/masturbation.  After THAT we're going to go cold turkey, no sex but orgasam-less karezza.  Timing that phase to go along with PMS/period, seems easier that way.

I'm really skeptical about nofap AND karezza but I feel like I can't knock either til I've tried it, and wanted to compare it to having sex every day.  Not remotely scientific, obviously, but it makes for good blogging, and honestly the 30 day sex challenge has been so beneficial that it alone makes the whole scheme worth it.  Assuming we don't break up during nofap/karezza month.  Which is entirely possible.  We are 300% more likely to fight about stupid shit when we're not having sex with each other.

When I was 19, the love of my life committed suicide. I think I'm the opposite of you, because I *couldn't* talk about it. It was like, when I talked, all of my memories and feelings were leaking out and I would lose them forever.

I was a sophomore in college, and it happened in the summer. When I went back to school (he had been at a different school), it felt like I was carrying around a big, heavy secret. Obviously my friends knew, but my acquaintances didn't, and it felt weird bringing it up. Like *Hey, Lab Partner, sorry to be a downer but I'm having a rough year because my BF committed suicide.* It didn't come up in conversation naturally, and I had hard time talking about him anyway, so it was like a weird secret.

It's been close to 20 years now, and I still miss him, but I can at least deal with it in a much healthier way. I don't feel comfortable talking about him with my parents, but it's not like someone's punching me if he happens to pop up in conversation. I can talk about that time of my life now that there's distance there."

There are many reasons Obamacare passed and you are drastically oversimplifying it. No one disagreed that the healthcare system in the US is messed up and needed fixing. Many people believe that gun ownership is a right that should not be messed with. 

The US is so hypocritical. We say that other (""less reasonable"") countries shouldn't have nuclear weapons and yet we still have a stockpile of them. Why would we keep them, yet insist that they are dangerous and bad? Protection. 

Obama is against guns...but I'll bet he's protected by them at all times. If he were truly against guns, he'd get rid of the secret service agents following him around. The fact is that guns are both useful and for many entertaining (the gun range, skeet shooting, etc.).

People don't want guns in the hands of mentally unstable folks or criminals, but there is almost always a way for them to get them. Heck, these days it's getting possible to 3D print a gun. Obviously we should try to not let people who would harm themselves or others access to them. No one, not even the NRA is arguing that point. It may appear so because in the wake of shootings, they advocate that gun control shouldn't be strengthened: That's because humans are emotional and in the wake of tragedy act without thinking. The NRA is simply trying to make sure that more than the tragedy is considered if and when more laws are enacted."

No.  

Illegal entry is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison and fines, or a felony (punishable by two years in prison and larger fines) if committed after having once been deported.

Unlawful presence is a different offense (and is, as the quote you provided states, a civil offense) punishable by deportation.  It was intended to be applied to people who overstay visas, but is often what illegals are charged with because the government doesn't want to enforce the law."

That's key right there, you already go the first date out of the way and wanted a 2nd.

Ha, I've know a girl whose brother and sister or best friend always comes on her dates. She's 24 now and she's not sheltered. It makes for horrible first impressions all around.

Just cause a guy wants 1-on-1 the first date doesn't mean he's controlling, he just wants to get to know YOU, not your friends. If it keeps on after that it could just mean he's not comfortable around a group of strangers all at once. I prefer to be eased into a circle instead of being on the outside of all the inside jokes or trying to get myself in the convo. 

I'm not knocking your view, this is just another view. Mind you I'm fairly introverted and I get tired trying to keep up with a bunch of randoms, it's way worst trying fight for your attention, and I wouldn't want a 2nd date afterwards.

Don't be emotional or dramatic, just be upfront and honest about the fact that, while you respect his right to live how he wishes, you can't tolerate his lifestyle due to concerns for your own health and wellbeing. Your concerns are legitimate, you really could get very sick from being around him.

You go out, make friends. One of them is trans and tells you it's okay to ask them questions? Go for it. They say questions are a no go? Respect that. You have no trans friends? Oh well. Ask the internet.

Squat - Knees not valgus (collapsing in), torso braced and chest up, squat descends past 90 degrees. Besides that, foot placement, hand placement, bar placement on your back are all up to you.

You know, I wonder if at some point we'll discover that Kate had a rough life, and everyone else is just here to make sure she never feels sad again. Of course, that doesn't contradict her ruling them with an iron first, and being adamant about changing the world.

I think this is most likely it. None of the others emphasize the need to ""stick together"" as much as Kate, and as we saw with Yasu, some of them aren't that enthusiastic about being there. Also, it sounds like Goro was ""dominated"" by Kate and so joined her because...respect? Fear? (probably the former, Kate says she fear doesn't motivate people and so wouldn't want to use fear as a weapon.) I mean, I imagine everyone has some sort of sketchy past, but I think Kate is going to be the one who wants the family aspect of Zvezda.

Do you think the people guarding the white house don't have military-style assault weapons? (Hint: I live in DC. I've seen them. They have military-style assault weapons.) The purpose of the 2nd amendment is to be able to have weapons to defend yourself against the government, should things go bad (i.e. too high taxes on tea). A hand gun or a rifle would hardly protect you in this day and age from the government. The argument that such weapons are potentially dangerous is a somewhat laughable argument considering there are so many household products that can be turned into explosives. If someone wants to do mass damage, they'll inflict mass damage. I could get in a car, drive to a public street where there are lots of people and gun it onto the sidewalk. 

Alright, the NRA is a little extreme. I see where they are coming from though. Once one person's right is violated, it does make it easier for more people to lose their rights. It goes with the poem at the end of the Holocaust Museum:

wordswench,gradadmissions,1390699267.0,"Hey! Keep calm, you can do this :) 

So what kind of program are you interviewing for? That will help somewhat, but here is the breakdown of what's going to go on:

1. You're going to walk into a professor's office, introduce yourself, and shake hands politely.
2. They will ask you about yourself. They want to know your work background, course background, what interests you have as a scientist, etc. 
3. They will continue leading with questions so you walk them through what you think about, what ideas you have, and what projects you're working on now.
4. Afterwards, they will tell you about their research, and ask you whether you have questions for them.

Steps 1-3 are a no brainer for anyone who's actually into their project and really working independently - I basically didn't prepare because I was talking about my thesis and was balls-deep in it from the get go, hahaha. Step 4 is what gets a little trickier.

I was a little overzealous and for each interview I printed out a little paper 'cheat sheet' with info copied from each professor's website - their current projects, background, etc. I would say you don't have to read their papers for sure, but you should have a good idea of what kinds of projects they're doing and what concepts they're looking at. 

As to questions to ask them, I would say I tried to come up with at least one question about something specific they told me about or that I had read about. I would go more for challenge or conceptual concepts than clarifying questions. What I mean is, unless I needed to, rather than saying ""can you explain your approach again"", I would say ""In my work we've done X, have you thought of working something like that into &lt;similar project&gt; Y?"" or ""It seems like you could do some kind of off-shoot project Z, have you thought about that?"" 

These questions were very self-serving -- I wanted to know what they were going to work on because if I joined their labs I wanted to know where they were going to go. 

If I couldn't come up with a really specific question like that, I would express general interest in what they were doing, and then ask one of these questions:

* What is the trajectory of your lab? Where do you see research going in your group in the next 5 years?

* How do you organize projects in your lab? From the ones you've told me about, are those group projects (3-4 grad students per concept, or 1 postdoc and a grad student, etc.) or usually individual?

* What do you think the most useful background for your kind of research is?

You are going to be fine, just be excited about your work and ready to discuss it and you will do great! Good luck!"

imnotminkus,OSU,1390699279.0,"Do you know which ones do?

I'm at NASA with a CIS degree. As far as I know, any of the things in the CS field there are open to CIS and CSE.

For some agencies there's a special designation (AST) for STEM-related degrees (that involves being paid more initially), and there's a list of math/science requirements.  CIS meets those requirements."
Astaro,skiing,1390699281.0,"The path to becoming a commercial pilot can be rough, especially for rotor-craft.

Helicopters are expensive to operate. Every part on them has a lifetime measured in operating hours.
A bolt or bearing in the rotor hub might have a lifetime of ~200hrs. longer lived components might have  a lifetime of ~2000hrs.

The cheapest helicopter to operate is a Robinson r22, which costs ~$5/min in part lifetime costs alone.

It's not hugely difficult to meet the private pilots licence requirements.
Getting a professional pilots licence is harder, but not insurmountable.
The tricky part comes next - There are a lot of young people who want to be pilots, and there aren't enough jobs for all of them. Typically, you race to get your instructors certificate, so you can get other people to pay for your flying hours to gain logged flying time.
Junior instructor jobs pay extremely poorly, and if you are desperate for the hours, you might find yourself volunteering your time for free with youth-groups etc.
typically when you are getting paid, it's only for your flying time, which isn't consistent.

Once you have a few thousand hours of experience, you stand a reasonable chance of getting a job with a non-school operator who might actually pay you reasonable money.

I don't want to discourage you, flying can be hugely rewarding. But you need to go into this with a clear plan on how you are going to fund yourself through the student and early career phases of becoming a commercial pilot.

I didn't do it myself, although I wanted to. I nearly joined the air-force, but my height and my migraines prevent me from taking a pilot position.

If you are still young enough, I highly recommend looking at joining the A.T.C if you are in England or a commonwealth country, or the US equivalent. Maybe air-scouts if they operate in your area. Take advantage of the discounted or subsidised flying time I mentioned earlier.

That said, there has been a small movement to prepare things for the Temple's reconstruction.  They've done things like build temple articles where possible, and learn the rules surrounding it.  And there've occasionally been people who think the Dome of the Rock should be destroyed and the Temple built, but that wasn't really an attempt or a movement--really just rumblings from a fringe.  The closest thing was some people trying to lay a cornerstone for the Temple in 1990, but it led to riots."

wordswench,GradSchool,1390700294.0,"1. Job prospects - I can't do anything I want to in this field without the PhD, realistically speaking. I know I will need it eventually. 

2. Incredibly passionate about what I do. I am just so excited to do my work. I had a huge amount of fun in undergrad and grad school is really only better.

3. Nope, I definitely got offered jobs. Nothing better than being paid to get ready for jobs you actually want ... whee! 

&gt; And what advice would you give to a student who is going to graduate within the next 3 months and has no idea what to do.

Noooooo. Don't go. Grad school will eat you alive and make you VERY sad unless you find it worthwhile or exciting. I would HATE my program if I didn't love what I was doing ... I am at a pretty competitive tough school but most of my friends feel the exact same way even if they are not at top tier schools.

Find a reasonable job. ANY kind of job. Any place that will hire you! If you don't like it, look for another place to go. Have you interned as an undergrad? Did you get any sense of what you were interested in doing with your life? What field are you in? Maybe specifics will help ...

But whatever you do DON'T just go to grad school. For a few reasons.

1. If they interview you, they'll catch your uncertainty, 99.9999%. I know people who applied and didn't get in because you could smell how desperate they were to avoid the real world.

2. It takes a lot of dedication and ""I don't want to be homeless and want to postpone life confusion"" doesn't usually produce that dedication...

3. It is expensive if you go for masters, and a LONG time to slave away for something you're unsure about for a PhD.

Avistew,sex,1390701476.0,"Honestly, I think she's way too caught up in ""males are like this, females are like that"". Not every male is the same, not every female is the same, and the risk with assuming they are is treating people in ways that just don't work for them.

And in her case, she just assumed things about you based on the fact that you are male rather than based on who you are as a person, and that's one of the problems here.

Now, I agree with the idea that fair and symmetrical aren't the same, and that things don't need to be symmetrical in a relationship, and that often it's better if they're not. But it's a two-way street. For instance if I like loading the dishwasher but I hate unloading it, and my partner is the opposite, we each do our side of the chore rather than alternate.

But here she's talking about you compromising on both ends and her getting her way both times. Of course you can want to protect your privacy when you have nothing to hide. You want to be trusted. You want to be respected. Sharing everything is a thing that happens, but voluntarily. You volunteer that sharing, it's not demanded of you.

I still feel that the whole GPS thing was unhealthy. Wanting you to send a text every now and then to let her know who you are might have been a compromise, if you had been okay with it, but she took it to a level of, pretty much ""I decide and you obey"".

As far as wanting less sex, so she should have it whenever she wants... er no. You don't force your partner to have sex, that's just not cool, and when you're the partner with a lower sex drive, you should not only know what it's like to be pressured, and therefore not do it, but also realise that whatever rejection you take every once in a while is nothing compared to the repeated rejection of your partner. Completely on your side on this one, and I think she really lacks empathy. She seems unable to realise that the way she felt that one time about being refused sex must be the way she's made you feel every time she wasn't in the mood.

In the end, I think her main problem is that she feels it's the role of the man in her life to ""make her feel secure"". Insecurity is something that must be solved from the inside. You should not rely on someone else for it. And if her reaction to her insecurity is policing you more, the relationship would just evolve to get more and more restricted (you'd have to look away when passing women in the street, never look at magazines because there are females on them, not talk to females, etc) because she'd just realise whatever she does does not make her feel more secure.

Because even if she spies on you constantly, there are always ways you could go around it, and she'd never really know, and the more she spies, the more she obsesses on whether you're cheating. The more she obsesses, the more terrible she feels, and the more extra barriers she'll want in place to ""make her secure"". And the more insecure she becomes.

It's not a new pattern or anything unheard of. Restriction put in place to prevent cheating only serve to make people resent each other and will drive people apart. What you need is a partner who shares your values and opinions, and then to trust each other.

I'm really sorry about it all, and I wish you to get better over that break. I guess there is a tiny possibility that she will, too, and that you can get back together, but at this point it doesn't seem that likely. That sucks and I'm sorry about that."

My ""broad, general statement"" is based on the idea that porn normalizes sex and teaches you to respect partners and enjoy it, rather than teaching that sex is a sin. While the porn industry leaves much to be desired, I am sick of slut-shaming individuals like you telling girls to hide their bodies from people, because THAT is what contributes to ideas that girls who dress slutty ""deserve"" to be raped, and the idea that naked girls have no self-respect."

If it's a more one-on-one context and therefore ambiguous at best, and a clear date at worst, then they should be warned before the date, in my opinion, because it's likely to affect their decision on whether or not they want to show up.

Yes, most people are monogamous, but the point isn't to trick people by letting them know in the way that's more likely to get them to go for it reluctantly because they've invested too much or aren't comfortable refusing at that stage. The point is to figure out as early as possible if someone is compatible with you romantically (or even as a friend. You want accepting friends)."

ventuckyspaz,Infographics,1390702138.0,I'm sorry but I've been working for limousine companies for a while and a $1 per person tip to a driver would be an insult it would be better tipping nothing. The last 2 limo companies I've worked for gives %15 of the bill to the driver anyways but an additional 5-15% tip is nice as most people don't realize limo drivers are paid minimum wage and really do depend on additional tips from customers to make the job worth it. An airport transfer is going to cost (with the company I currently work for) about $130 dollars. The driver gets minimum wage per hour for however long the job takes (usually around 3 hours) and will get a $15 dollar built in tip with the hourly wage. Tipping a $20 or even a $10 is really great for these hard workers who really do deserve it (Unless they do something to mess up the job.). If you can afford $130 to be driven to the airport by a chauffeur you can afford an extra $20 to give them at the completion of the job.
wordswench,relationships,1390702139.0,"There are two differences:

1. Weight gain is something you can do something about, and moreover, something you may WANT to do something about for your own health - talking about it is not always a selfish preferential thing.

2. It's also usually an alteration of something you were signed up for. Someone who started dating a 5'0"" 250 pound girl and then complained ""I wish you weren't so fat"" would be treated with equal distaste because that's what they started dating! It's not like you became tiny. You have always been 5'1"" (in your adult life anyway). It's weird that he spends time complaining about this.

3. There is a big difference between loving someone who isn't necessarily your physical type and being aware of that, versus loving someone and remarking somewhat often (as it seems he does) on the fact that they aren't your type in ways they can't alter... E.g., there's a different between telling my boyfriend ""Oh yeah, I usually like taller guys"" versus ""Oh, I wish you were tall, I'm honestly not attracted to people who aren't"". 

I think you should talk to him and ask WHY he says he what he says. What does he hope you will do in response? Is he just saying it conversationally? Does he realize that it is hurtful?

I second everyone else who says that your relationship isn't perfect if you can't talk about this stuff. Talking is uncomfortable and NOT always easy, but good communication is something both partners need to be dedicated to and invested in for the health of their relationship. It sounds like neither of you two honestly want to try at it, no matter why that is (intimidation or disinterest or whatever other reason you can think of)."

She would be complimentary to Toon Link and also be a light, agile fighter. She hits quick and dirty; most of her basic and aerial attacks would be light blows with her fists and feet or using her cutlass, but her specials could make use of all the items that Toon Link passed on taking.

**B: Skull Hammer** - Large, disjointed hitbox, good amount of lag. Sweet spot is a spike which could make it useful for edge-guarding.

**Side-B: Deku Leaf** - On the ground, she fans forward with it and a puff of air comes out, deflecting projectiles. In the air it lets her float for a few seconds, giving her great horizontal recovery. Would also hit opponents upward if used in the air.

**Up-B: Catapult** - Launches her at a 45° angle and lets her act after using it (similar to Sonic's up-B spring).

**Down-B: Grappling Hook** - Acts as a tether grab in addition to her primary grab (which would just be reaching out with her hand). Can be used to grab ledges."

**EDIT:** This was because New Zealand almost completely lacked any mammalian life (aside from a few bat species), this allowed for various flightless birds (including the famous Kiwi) to evolve and dominate the landscape without threat of losing their eggs. 

It's absolutely crazy that this kind of evolution and isolation led to birds towering at 13 ft behaving almost exactly like cattle and deer.

Usually if a hero isn't picked, it is for other reasons, especially a support.

Crystal maiden is very powerful in the beginning and able to even jungle a bit to get extra income. Visage is just overall a powerhouse.

Unlawful presence is a different offense (and is, as the quote you provided states, a civil offense) punishable by deportation.  It was intended to be applied to people who overstay visas, but is often what illegals are charged with because the government doesn't want to enforce the law."

Waaaay back when, when I was in high school, a friend of mine had a mother that had a similar attachment problem. He'd get grounded for long periods of time for relatively minor offenses. He was pretty intuitive as a teenager, and attributed it to his mother being clingy with him as well, so to speak.

So, he played a bit of a mind game with it. He started doing things with his mom. Lots of things. And he'd be totally happy and friendly doing it - no spite, nothing like that - but he'd take it a few notches further than his mom wanted, on purpose.

Eventually, it worked, and it kinda ""sank in"" with his mom when one day he went up to her and asked ""So, I'm coming to the store with you, right?"", and his mom just looked at him and said, ""You should go hang out with your friends.""

Even though he was grounded."

Tog_the_destroyer,AskReddit,1390704946.0,"Wasted time chasing after her

Edit: I'll quit being a cheeky cunt and tell you my side of the story. I apologize for any and all typos.

 A brief overview is that she (hereby named ""BF"" for bitch face) threw herself at me, and I turned her down (I was oblivious to her advances at the time). I realized how BF felt and quickly fell for her. As soon as I fell for her, she pulled away and never explained why. She and I had mutual friends and we hung out a lot. I was basically in love with her my entire Senior year and she knew this. Even though she had no further romantic intent with me (a mutual friend informed me of this) she would flirt with me shamelessly and intentionally. 


At this time she was having family problems and would miss lots of school. I was so infatuated with her that anytime she would be missing from school, I would text her, ""is everything ok?"" Every single day. She would say it was ok and that was it. She took my genuine concern for her  as a sign that I was whipped and ""wrapped around her little finger.""


Later in the year, I decided to ask BF's best friend to prom. This girl ruined my ask because I didn't ask her (made no sense to me). I'm not proud to admit but I still wasn't over BF, not by a long shot


I've got some more stories of anyone is interested!

Edit 2: even after BF was a bitch to me all that year, I still wasn't done with her (the heart wants what the heart wants yo). Over the next year I spent countless hours trying to get her attention in a romantic light and she caught on and again, kept me on a leash. This time, she never flirted with me, which is better I guess. Everything that year culminated at a buddy's Christmas party where I hoped I would have a chance at her (wishful thinking right?). No chance. I always ahead stories of her getting with guys, but never seen it. This night she got plastered and got with her friend of 12 years. Naturally I was heartbroken, but it was just what I needed to get over her.

Fast forward 6 months after the Christmas party. I hadn't really talked to her all that much (yay me!) when she came forward asking me if I wanted to come with her family on a week long trip up to a mountain resort for a holiday. I thought this was my opportunity! On the way up, I began to stealthily prod around and asked about her boyfriend, whom I hoped didn't exist. He didn't, but she was dating someone. What really shocked me about it all was that when she said they never said they were exclusive, so this justified her getting drunk and getting with guys. She just never told him. I was stoic, not wanting to judge her relationship and make the car ride awkward, but iternally I was disgusted.

Over the course of the week, she met a guy there, he kissed her, there was drama. We left, she talked about how hot he was. We went to a friend's party. I invited some buddies from college. They brought their friend Ed. BF got with Ed after all the drama. I was stunned, but not surprised. I ought to thank her though. That was the last straw. I am done with her. Haven't really talked to her in 6 months and I'm ok with that. Her on the other hand, not so much. It's complicated.

Well, at least its a tradition.  Unfortunately, most of our ambassadors are political appointees with no particular skill at the job (or anything else, for that matter, other than sucking up to whatever administration they were appointed under).  This practice goes back to the 18th century.

Some of the ambassadors to countries we are at odds with are better qualified, as (sometimes) are those to our biggest allies.  When those people are idiots in a public sense it can create serious international incidents.

Alas, ambassadors to smaller allies and most other countries are less well-served.

There's a big difference between letting a girl talk to whoever because she knows that if she oversteps her boundary she's gone, and letting a girl talk to whoever because if you don't, you're gone.

It takes very little time to establish which dynamic you're in, and women know with a 100% certainty which one they're in.  If you're ever in the latter, the ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude that a lot of men want is just a front."

The vagrant box I use to dev with is based off of a puphpet config, and it's been a good base to work from. Just had to write a shell script to install &amp; set up the nginx/python stuff.

The main challenges I've run into with vagrant are that it takes for-fucking-ever to stand up a box, and to reload/re-provision... but to be fair, that's probably not a problem with Vagrant, it's just unrealistic wishes (give me a fresh ubuntu box now!). Because of that, it can take hours upon hours to nail down the details of your provisioning scheme, and verify that in fact it works as expected. But once you get that out of the way, it's mostly downhill."

Unicornrows,confession,1390707678.0,"That is a really bad upbringing, obviously. It's very unfortunate and unfair that you were treated that way. But you could change today. You mention low fat; I think keto or paleo would be diets which are easier to stick to. But it sounds like you know what is healthy and what isn't. Your therapist is restricted from giving you ""tough love"" or harsh criticism. Maybe you could make sure you only have healthy food around and only a certain amount. Have someone else take over your diet. After all, it's emotional; you know what's healthy and you aren't doing it. You and I both understand from an outside perspective how your upbringing would cause your issues with food, but we also both know you could theoretically just change today because it's all happening within you. It makes sense in the third person, but this is your life, not someone else's; you are the one who moves your own hands. People quit smoking, quit using heroin, and make other major changes all the time. You have complete control and you just aren't using it. We all see this as a very sad story, and I am sorry if I sound insensitive, because it is a rough thing to get past, but you have to do so for your own sake and your daughter's sake. You have the power to make this into a happy and inspiring story by simply taking different actions. There has to be someone somewhere with a worse upbringing who still does the right thing for themselves. You can't save your younger self from bad things, but you have complete control over your future, and by extension, your daughter's (she will want you alive and healthy, of course.)

I feel like this comment might overstep commenting bounds a little, so sorry if it does. I mean it in a good way and I hope things work out for you and your daughter. I don't think the way you're controlling your daughter's life is wrong; it sounds like it's well within the bounds of normal child raising. I think it's good to push them towards good choices while they are young and let them decide for themselves when they are older.

Wulibo,changemyview,1390708039.0,"**1** You assume that it is only the effects that are important, and not the principle. This is called Consequentialism and is often (but certainly not overwhelmingly so) considered to have a weaker intellectual basis than Deontology, the opposite view (although further views like Relativism are generally considered even weaker). I personally would agree with the Consequentialist view, but it is still worth debating on its own, and should not be argued from as if axiomatic.

**2** You provide no evidence or even argument supporting that it does not happen on a large scale. Furthermore, I don't understand what you mean by ""large scale."" As I said in an earlier comment, I live in an area strongly predominated by Chinese people. In this area, I have had extreme difficulty finding any employment, and have encountered hateful calls of ""Guailo,"" as examples of what could be considered racism. Whether this counts as large scale is based on how we decide why a sufficiently large scale makes something important.

If being on the large scale turns something important because the experience is shared by enough people, then no, my example is not large scale. However, this seems like a weak argument to me. If a person is turned down from one job for what they suspect may be racial reasons, their feelings would be hurt, and we're in the friend group area of not-racism again, because they are presumably qualified for a similar job. On the other hand, if a sufficiently large scale creates importance because on a sufficiently large scale a person loses several possible jobs they are qualified for, to the point that they are demonstrably economically damaged, and possibly out of a job completely, this puts it into the job-loss area of racism. I find the latter argument *much* more compelling. If you also accept this definition, I have demonstrated that the effects are wide-spread enough for at least one person that it can be considered ""important,"" and because your argument hinges on importance being an on-off where if discrimination is not ""important"" it isn't racism, that importance just for me causes racism against white people to be objectively important enough to affirm OP's view with your definition.

*TL;DR* I don't feel I should do tldrs for this subreddit, but I wrote a lot more than you so at least a simplified thesis statement is fair. *It's not necessarily true that the effect and not the principle is what's important, and with the definitions you're replying to and claiming yourself, unless you accept what I consider a weak definition of ""Large Scale,"" your argument falls apart.*"

People think Mail Monday is inappropriate, as he gives sex advice to minors. They even go as far as to call him a pedophile. This accusation is completely insane.

I'm trying to get inside the heads of the people hate him. Honestly, most people here are COMPLETELY failing to do that, saying things like ""the hate is because subs of jealous youtubers are brainwashed into thinking woody is a bad guy."" Come on dresseduser62.

In order to understand why people don't like him, you can't just say ""they hate him because he's rich and dedicated and awesome!"" There are semi valid reasons why people don''t like.

In all seriousness, your saving grace will be flashcards. Not just any flashcard sets that you find off of Quizlet, either: you have to make these yourself, and format them in a way that makes you ask ""How could this be used as a question on the exam?"". For every line of info that you read, there are at least two possible questions/flashcards that can be made from it.

For example, if your notes happen to say
&gt; **Hematology is the study of blood.**

You must assume that one of your exam questions will be either: 

* What is the study of blood? *Hematology*

* Hematology is the study of ___? *blood*

Make flashcards like this for every single line of notes you are given. Again, *every single line*: never make the mistake of assuming that something's not going to be on the exam, because it fucking will be. It's time consuming, it's stressful, you'll hate the process, but it works.

**Log Horizon** is a fun romp, just like it was in the beginning. The story's decelerated somewhat since we've moved to a more politically driven part in the story, but it seems that starting in the next two episodes we've got some major action on our hands.

**Samurai Flamenco** is kind of schizophrenic. Honestly, I find it hard to explain; I'll let someone else handle it.

Wulibo,changemyview,1390709209.0,"I don't agree that systematic oppression is something that happens at the scale of entire civilizations, or if it is, it is not something that generally happens in modern western civilizations.

That word implies intention, and for it to be carried out in a premeditated manner. This is important, as even you admit, by separating it as fundamentally different from racial discrimination. Therefore, if you are to claim that *entire* civilizations systematically target specific race groups, you claim that every member of that civilization acknowledges at least to themselves that their actions reflect an intent to put down members of the aforementioned race groups. As I, and I hope you, do not carry out actions in such a manner, then the civilization I (and hopefully you) belong to is demonstrably not entirely systematically racist. Depending on how you define civilization, that could mean western culture or just the campus I live on.

I am willing to consider it possible, again, under certain definitions of ""civilization,"" that entire civilizations could, theoretically, and possibly once or twice historically, be systematically racist. Obviously if every member of x group was systematically racist to y group, then members of y group could likely not be considered citizens of that civilization. If we use a small enough definition, which I don't feel you mean to, there could be civilizations in the modern western world that are systematically racist. However, this is an overwhelmingly small minority of the population, and I doubt this is the kind of racism OP's opponents were discussing. So, using ""civilization"" to mean, say, nation, it is fair to assume no modern western nation is entirely systematically racist. Therefore, the people OP is arguing against, using this definition, have been shown to be wrong."

Wulibo,changemyview,1390709913.0,"**1** your conclusion is an ad hominem and/or association fallacy. If you mean to say that specific arguments are invalid because certain people use them, your argument does not follow. If you mean to say that OP is equatable to a white supremacist because of the argument used, your argument does not follow and would mean nothing if it did.

**2** I do not think that you have successfully demonstrated that it follows by x group of people being predominantly in power, they cannot experience racism on a societal/institutional level. I think it is possible to consider certain attitudes in Hip Pop music racist on a societal level, because of the widespread nature of it, and the demeaning picture it paints of black people. However, the genre is predominantly controlled by black people. Therefore, it is conceivably possible for a party in power to discriminate groups it belongs to, at a societal/institutional level.

I do not think you have successfully demonstrated that white people are predominantly in power in western nations. Affirmative Action may be cited as an example of systematic empowerment of non-white people, which shows that white people do not currently necessarily hold enough of the power to be called predominantly, or at least will not in the near future considering the current trend as a result.

**3** I disagree that minorities stand to suffer the most from racism. If it is granted that minorities are generally fiscally worse off than the majority racial group, which can be easily verified by facts, then they objectively have less to lose. If all racism were to be magically lifted at this moment, and then reapplied in any specific manner, placing it all on white people would damage them more than placing it all on minorities, because white people, controlling so much wealth, would lose more total wealth."

temp9876,canada,1390709936.0,"Western Canada, I have gotten the impression that it makes a difference. 

I remember Canadian history being very... anti-civilization.  If that makes sense.  We learned a very utopian view of the first nations, and then every new stage was presented as something bad.  Lois Riel was the best guy ever, and the pioneers that came to the prairies before it was well settled were awesome sauce.

A lot of the key Canadian history was just sort of, stuff that happened out east.  The French are just Quebec, the English are just Ontario, and we didn't really identify with either side.  It was more about settlers who had left their various European countries and come west that were the real ""Canadians"", aside from First Nations of course.  There was also a lot more attention to minority immigrant groups, pretty much anyone but the English or French.

In retrospect that perspective makes total sense with the typical cultural heritage of my classmates and I, so maybe it wasn't intentional and that is just the stories that stood out and held meaning to us.  "

Woody and Lefty are SUPER quick to label people as haters. They see one piece of criticism, constructive or not, and claim that that person ""hates"" them. If someone IRL told me they thought my shoes were lame I wouldn't say ""THAT WASN'T CONSTRUCTIVE! WHY DO YOU HATE ME?!"" Calling everyone ""haters"" is really childish.

I don't want to be too harsh on Woody, but I think the part about him not being loyal to his subs is somewhat true. On one hand, he doesn't have to upload videos if he doesn't want to, and he never promised us anything. On the other hand he doesn't give a shit about his subscribers who got him there in the first place. He knows he could record a 10 minute commentary without gameplay easily and it would make 100,000 people happy. 

Before someone says ""he doesn't upload because people are hateful and ungrateful,"" he's said so many times that he doesn't care about hate. He also said he thinks only 1% of people hate him, which is really inconsistent with his complaints about how everyone hates him.

What's the point of this long-winded post? I don't know. I do believe that while Woody is a likable guy, there are valid reasons to dislike him. I wish people wouldn't say ""you're either a fan or a hater!"" I enjoy Woody's content and I recognize his contribution to PKA, but he also does some things that I find off-putting.

The US has been aiding the Pakistani Army for quite some time, as a result. The Army plays a big role in Pakistani society, having frequently overthrown governments. Anyways, to get to your point, why does the US aid Pakistan? Personally, I wish the US didn't. But I'm a bit biased, since I'm ethnically Indian. Anyways, if the US cut off aid to Pakistan, especially to their Army, it is possible that the generals would turn to US rivals in search of foreign support (shaky US aid has already pushed Pakistan to get close to China), or that they would allow for a more radical government to take form. So it is kinda the devil you know versus the devil you don't arrangement. Also, Pakistan is a nuclear state. Better the devil you know with nukes than the devil you don't.

But yeah, Pakistan definitely sponsors terrorism to a high level. Of course, so do several other US allies. Saudi Arabia and Qatar come to mind, especially due to their involvement in the Syrian Civil War."

FeatherDie,AskWomen,1390711546.0,"It's common practice to both cleanse and moisturize the face daily. Moisturizing any skin in general is a good idea (especially if you are outdoors often).

It is expensive, but one bottle has lasted me a long time, and I don't need to use it every day. I would say with daily use it would still last you at least 6 months.

It sounds like you're not taking advantage of all the repair/maintenance products available to you. IF you were my best pal and needed advice I would give you a different routine.

1. Find a facial cleanser you like. Use it.
2. Find a moisturizer you like (with SPF) because sun damage will make your skin look like a shop rag.
3. Rinse and repeat daily. 

note: There are TONS of products out there for skin care. I find that with my very normal slightly sensitive skin this is the best method.

You can try any kind of eye repair product you like. Just make sure to add this stuff to your daily routine if you want actual results. Good luck trying to remove the raccoons from your lineage."
thattallgirl13,sex,1390711549.0,"Ahh, well good! My situation was a little different...I talked to the guy for probably close to two months before meeting him, because I was terrified. He was ridiculously good looking and we got along SO well, I figured there was NO chance that he'd be into me when we met. But eventually we did, and he was certainly into me. Lots of fun was had, but he was pretty disappointing in the size department. It honestly just kind of made me feel like I was molesting a child, and it was a TOTAL turn off for me. 

For a few other reasons, it just wasn't going to work out on my end. I didn't feel it. But I didn't really know how to tell him, so we talked for another week or two before I let him know that I was interested in dating other people. He completely flipped out on me, saying I was an awful person for doing this to him, blah blah blah. And then the last text message he sent to me said ""I just wanted to let you know something because I feel kind of bad. The weekend after we met in person, I slept with another girl. I just thought you should know. Don't bother replying to this, I won't read it."" LOL. What a fucking ass. 1.) He was probably lying, making him a douche that was just trying to hurt me, or 2.) He was telling the truth, making him a douche because he then has no right to yell at me for dating other people when we were most definitely NOT exclusive.

1up-,AskReddit,1390712166.0,"The summer when I was 12, there boys riding their bikes around the neighborhood. They seemed cute from my window. So I got off the computer, dusted off my bike, and ""casually"" rode my bike to ""accidentally"" run into them. Turns out one brother was 14 and the other was 11. Of course I had a crush on the ""older boy"" and so we started riding our bikes and hanging out. I tried ""flirting"" but being socially awkward and 13 it didn't really work. My older brother and younger sister, and their younger brother (age 8) all started riding our bikes and we would have bike races.

Let me mention, I was not at all athletic, and my subdivision was hilly as all get out. Often I would have to pull ahead just so I could rest and not have an asthma attack. 

So one race, I was in the lead, barely, and trying to impress the boys, so I took a 180 degree turn too fast, and wiped out. I scraped up my knee really badly, and my elbows, and all that. I remember thinking, I was okay, I just had to walk down the hill and I'd be home, but then I remember thinking ""Fuck it, this is bad."" And started bawling as everyone biked up. 

I went home, my dad bandaged me up and I was out of commission for the rest of the summer. Also really embarrassed.

Tl;dr Lazy 12-year old me biked to impress a boy. It didn't work. I wiped out and started bawling, and never saw the boy again."

Willravel,horror,1390712566.0,"Remake bad movies. Watch good movies. 

The amount of times a genuinely good film has been remade into a genuinely good film is incredibly small. Other than films like *True Grit*, *The Departed*, and *The Thing*, I'm drawing a blank. *Poltergeist* is one of the most successful ghost movies ever, in fact, adjusted for inflation, it's one of the most successful horror/thriller movies of all time. Tropes from that movie are still part of the entertainment and public zeitgeist. ""They're here..."" is something I've had kids say to me in the last few years. 

On the other hand, I remember, upon hearing TNG and DS9 writer Ronald Moore was remaking *Battlestar Galactica*, thinking that's a great idea. The original had some really interesting ideas, but ended up being a bit of a Star Wars clone and was in the process of being lost into forgotten television history. 

If they're going to remake something, they should find a good story that was bogged down by production costs or bad marketing or a poor cast. "

woollymammothsteak,AskWomen,1390712679.0,"Lemme paraphrase some bell hooks here:

No one just inherently knows how to love. For most of us, love is taught by our parents. If your parents did not provide you with care and affirmation that is the foundation of love you cannot expect to go out into the world knowing how to love yourself and what to expect when others love you. (Since you like reading, I suggest reading All About Love. From what you wrote, I think you will see a lot of yourself in this book.)

So, teach yourself what love is. I'm not saying it will be easy; but you've already taken good steps towards it - continue going to therapy (if you don't feel you've made any progress in a year of therapy, perhaps you still haven't met the right therapist - keep looking) and continue asking yourself and others these questions. Instead of seeking romantic relationships, consider pursuing purely platonic relationships while you continue providing yourself with self-care. Be selective about who you spend your time with. Expect a lot and give a lot. If the people in your life who are close to you cannot provide you with care and affirmation, don't keep them in your life.

Continue to invest in your well being. Throw yourself into your hobbies and interests; if you don't have any, start some. Don't place the value of these activities on the level of success you have with them. If you fingerpaint and it physically/mentally makes you feel good, then just do it. Don't critique your work. Churn it out like crazy. Let your ability be good enough for you; not good enough according to the standard you think other people are holding you to.

I know this is thrown around a lot, but caring for yourself and affirming yourself deliberately will prepare you to care for others and receive care and affirmation from them. You'll be able to better recognize when someone is not able to provide you with the care and affirmation you need, e.g. that douchebag you were dating last.

I think it's important to do things that support you physically and mentally. I love reading - I do that to make my brain feel good. I love feeling physically strong - I work out to make my body feel good. I go to the gym, I put on my earphones, I don't look at anyone else and I just kick my own ass.

I hope this makes some amount of sense - I have a lot of thoughts on this topic as someone who has felt very, very similarly and worked through a lot of it in the last couple years, but I have difficulty putting it into words."

So I know it really depends on your surrounding what you can pull off and what not.


Honest opinion:

* I wouldn't think anything negative about it if you're consistent in this period's style, makeup and hair do and if I could tell that it wasn't just a temporary fad but your lifestyle.

* I would cringe and feel embarrassed for you if you'd mix it with contemporary clothes.

It's unfair to those students, who have hope and opportunity dangled in front of them as they're roped into what is tantamount to predatory lending. It's unfair to students like me, who work our asses off to pay for college in the absence of federal monies to help offset the cost.

bigtcm,TrueAskReddit,1390713491.0,"First generation Chinese American here. Both my parents emigrated from Taiwan, and I think I'm dealing with a similar issues. I'll just write down my thoughts I guess.

* When I was a kid, all I wanted to do was fit in. I was ashamed that I spoke a 2nd language and the food I ate wasn't pizza and hamburgers. As I've grown older, I've definitely begun to embrace my heritage. I proudly speak Mandrin to anyone who understands. I will gladly share some off the menu items in the Chinese restaurants with friends.

* That said, I still want to be American. I love the fact that I have access to so many global foods and cultures here. Now that I think about it, I think I've been subconsciously trying to Westernize my mother. Why do we have to eat Chinese food all the time? You love music, but why listen to ONLY K pop? 

* To your point about bloodline, I personally think it's silly. Regardless of who I marry, I'm pretty sure my family will be quite close to my spouse and any future children I may have...the kids will be bound to be somewhat Chinese...and I have no problem with that. It's the culture that's much more important than the race/ethnicity/bloodline. If I adopted a little Mexican baby, the kid would probably be a fluent Mandarin speaker (due to my parents) when s/he grew up and would know good Chinese food like his father. 

*  I would never judge a potential mate based on what ethnicity kid she'd pop out though; it's just not important to me. I care much more about compatibility, personality, job security/education, physical attraction, etc. I don't care if my wife is 100% Chinese or a mix of Swedish, Native American, Vietnamese, and Arab. 

* That said, I would also like to have an interracial child though, but only because I just think segregation of cultures is bad for society. And I kind of want to do my part in promoting mixing of cultures. I truly believe that racial and societal tensions are due to cultures not understanding each other and a lack of familiarity. It does hurt me a little when people look down with disdain when it comes to Chinese food - *""What?! I can't believe you'd eat that. You Chinese people are so weird. That's so gross.""* Similarly, when my mom tells me, *""You can't date a black girl. How am I supposed to tell the family that you're dating a black girl?!!""* it makes my blood boil. Respect each other goddammit, we're all human."

(I'm about to go on a long tangent about how chargen works, it's not important, you can just skip to the next paragraph) It's not ""roll x Dy and modify z way then add racial modifiers,"" it's ""start with stats as given for your chosen race and add x number to this baseline within y limit based on z choices you made in character generation."" There is a reasonable amount of difference between them. Each race is given a certain number of choices between the four archetypes. Each race has at least one special ability unique to the race - for example, Trollkin gain two abilities from the Mighty archetype. Finally, races get special choices in specific careers (basically gestalt classes).

Bottom line, races are more complicated than in d20, and I don't trust my abilities to balance them properly.

When you make races, where do you start? Are the races completely of your own imagination? Are they simply reimaginings of existing races? Could you give a few examples of races you'd include? I'm a bit stuck about what should be included."

ReaditLore,atheism,1390714418.0,"&gt; How do you deal with someone that fights your atheism in a way not to be construed as a personal attack?

Two things help in this. 

One, we're not really defending any idea set - so our detractors can't really get their teeth into our ""atheism"", because there's nothing there.

Two, we tend to enjoy arguments. We like the conflict created by being criticized and offering counter critiques. It generates positive emotions like excitement and anticipation rather than negative ones.

&gt; I'm fighting the internal fight of whether or not to stick my finger in a light socket.

In my experience there's no road to Damascus moment where you accept atheism into your heart. One day I realized I simply didn't believe any of the same things the people around me did and decided it was a little deceptive to keep going to church."

cr42,college,1390714551.0,"If I could give you one piece of advice, it would be this: **keep going down the path you're on, and don't put any one school (even one like Caltech or MIT) on a pedestal**. 

You're involved in some interesting research, perhaps the sort of thing that you ought to enter in the Intel competition at some point, and you seem to show promises in the sciences academically. You seem like a motivated, gifted student. That said, anything that I -- or anyone else -- could tell you about your chances at Caltech would be purely conjecture. 

If you set your sights on any one school, be it Caltech, Harvard, MIT, or anywhere else, throughout your high school career, then anywhere else -- even another top school of the same caliber -- will almost feel like a compromise. Also, too often when people spend a lot of time worrying about the logo at the top of their acceptance letter, they run the risk of complacency once they get there; the beauty of a school like that is the opportunities they offer (world class research facilities, the best professors in the world, etc.), not just the name!

You have a good shot at getting into an elite school if you keep going down the path you're on, but you still have two years of school ahead of you. *Use them!* Don't look at high school as just a purgatory before the promise land of college; look at these next two years as a chance to prepare yourself academically to excel at a top school. If you apply yourself for the next two years, really get involved in this research and put yourself ahead in your courses, then you'll be prepared to distinguish yourself wherever you go, whether it be Caltech or another elite university. 

**TL;DR Focus on applying yourself in school and in the lab for the next two years, maybe take some college courses, and acceptances will come**."

milkymoocowmoo,MyLittleMotorhead,1390714763.0,"[](/hmmm) After /u/DonnyGreene wanted hood pics and then /u/_That_One_Guy_ posted a photoshoot, I realised that I don't actually have that many photos of my beloved Josephine, especially not since I plastidipped the wheels black.
[](/sp)
[](/swagintosh) Well, now I do! I went to the local train station and its deserted carpark, being that it's both Sunday and a long weekend where I am, armed with my Nexus 5 and the HDR setting. Posting the results both for /u/_That_One_Guy_ and in the name of promoting how *frickin' sweet* Euro hothatches are.
[](/sp)
[](/louder) I do wish the previous owner/s had've taken better care of the paint. I mean I've seen far worse, but oh god the swirls and the random chips. I need to treat the tires too so that they're actually black.
[](/sp)
[](/flutteryay) Additional! I think I've mentioned this before but on the route I usually take home there's a 90° turn off onto a residential street that I like to barely slow down for if there's nobody about. This was the case heading back after the shoot and I managed to lift the inside rear wheel! Not as much as /u/_That_One_Guy_ showed off but it was definitely leaving the asphault. I need to work out a way of attaching my Replay XD1080 to the sideskirt without making it permanent.

[](/sp)
[](/wahaha) EDIT: Ok so I found a way, sort of. The bodywork sort of flares out a little towards the wheels so if I mounted the camera on the side I'm not sure you'd actually be able to see them. Also, not too keen on sticking the mount to the bodywork as it's 3M VHB adhesive - it comes off but requires elbow grease. Then I realised the sideskirt (which is just plastic btw) has a flat edge underneath where it attaches to the underframe. Seeing as it's almost entirely out of sight, I attached a mount there and will just leave it. I fitted the camera in and went for a drive, with great results.

Wulibo,changemyview,1390714973.0,"**1** I'm curious how Affirmative Action is ""debunked"" and I'd genuinely like to hear more about that.

**2** It doesn't matter whether racism towards the majority has a similar negative effect as racism towards minorities. All that matters in this discussion is whether it exists. Your argument that racism only counts if its effect is important brings what constitutes importance into the discussion, and there's no avoiding that. I would legitimately argue that for any practical application, looking at the principal of the thing is more important to do than looking at the effects. If we are looking at laws, it is vital that laws are objective and are for the general case, rather than based on a current situation, because they are not inherently temporary, and so laws based on what is currently happening will cause problems in the future. If we are looking at social interactions, then behaviour is what matters, and behaviour is formed on principals and sets of values. Feel free to contribute other practical applications of the current debate.

As for whether it's worse to be racist (racially prejudiced maybe, so that we don't need to presuppose that racism against white people is possible) to a majority group or minority group, that argument falls *entirely* into whether it is more important to look at principle or effect. Institutionalized racism against groups who experience it harder objectively has a harder effect on them, yes. But does that mean it is fundamentally better to direct institutionalized racism to groups who experience it to a lesser extent? You are committing the same act."

eighthgear,asoiaf,1390715748.0,"&gt; The southern peasants live at a subsistence level. 

Um, no they don't. [Feudal manorialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism) is most definitely not subsistence agriculture. Subsistence agriculture is when farmers produce for themselves and their families, with little going elsewhere. The advanced feudal system present in Westeros would definitely not exist in a mostly subsistence-based society.

It is stated that Southern lords keep stores of food from good harvests, which makes complete sense. It is hard to imagine widespread starvation in the South without a significant cause. Famines don't occur in the South unless there is some external factors, like warfare (as in the War of the Five Kings) or the sort of long winters that occur very rarely. If the Southerners mainly existed on a subsistence level, the population would plummet rapidly with every winter, given that Westerosi winters (even normal ones) can last for a few years. I severely doubt this happens, because the periods between winter would provide ample time to build up stores of food.

Southern Westeros seems to possess a highly sophisticated economy, as feudal economies go. Furthermore, it is clearly wealthy enough to support large amounts of nobles and everything that comes with them (castles and whatnot). You don't get that in a subsistence society."

POGtastic,learnprogramming,1390716597.0,"You have eight neighbors - we'll just call them Neighbor0, Neighbor1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. In your program, you're going to refer to them by their indices. For example, Neighbor0 could be state[x-1][y-1].

If you have fewer than two live neighbors, you die.

If you have 2-3  live neighbors, you live.

If you have more than 3 live neighbors, you die.

If you are dead and have exactly three neighbors, you live.

Let's say we have a two-dimensional array of ints. Some are alive, (1) and some are dead (0).

    int NeighborState = 0;

    NeighborState |= Neighbor0 &lt;&lt; 0;
    NeighborState |= Neighbor1 &lt;&lt; 1;
    ...
    NeighborState |= Neighbor7 &lt;&lt; 7;

See what's happening? NeighborState will be eight bits, all of which signify what each of your neighbors are.

Now, add each of the bits together.

    for (i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++)
    {
        counter += NeighborState &gt;&gt; i &amp; 1;
    }

What this does is take the single rightmost bit and add it to the counter. If you're not allowed to do this, you're going to have to create an adder out of bitwise operations. This is retarded, but if you're that strongly constrained, I can't think of any other way to do this.

So, iteration 0 - it doesn't shift NeighborState at all, and it then does bitwise AND on it with 00000001. This removes all other bits and adds it to Counter.
Iteration 1 shifts NeighborState over by one bit and then does bitwise AND on it with 00000001.

The loop iterates through the integer and adds up all of the 1s to get the number of neighbors.

From here, you do your tests. If you're free to use if statements, use those. Otherwise, you'll have to do more bitwise operators.

Test 1: Is it less than 2?

Shift the counter over by one bit (counter &gt;&gt; 1). If there's anything there, then there's two or more and your test is negative.

Test 2: Is it greater than 3?

Shift the counter over by two bits (counter &gt;&gt; 2). If there's anything there, then there's four or more and your test is positive.

Test 3: If it's dead, are there exactly three neighbors?

Do bitwise XOR with 3. If there's anything there, then your test is negative.

This should probably be enough for you to at least get started. Have fun!"

blaghart,todayilearned,1390717047.0,"Ah yes, the ""if you tax them then they won't have any motivation to create jobs"" arguement.

You're ignoring that R&amp;D doesn't typically patent every step of the device, they usually research and are in a race for first to file.  this, despite massive competition and a total loss in the event of a failure due to how patents work.  Meaning they're gambling (already!) millions of dollars on something that may end up not just not returning the investment, but actually being illegal for them to reproduce on their own.

The truth of the matter is that knowing something will hit the public domain in the event of a failure to produce means that either A) once a device fails to have a market it will end up in the public domain where the public domain can do what it does best and think outside the box (the old, throw enough ""monkey at typwriters"" bit) or B) force companies to try and get patents to market rapidly to cash in on their services, sort of a reverse of what Robert Taylor did in that instead of buying up all the hand pumps to prevent competitors producing around his patent they'd try and maximize their income with better products while their patent lasted."

JAWJAWBINX,autism,1390717271.0,"The latest (which has been the working theory of most groups doing reasonable ASD research) is that it's wholly genetic but on a similar level of complexity as skin, hair, or eye color. Essentially you have multiple possible genes for the involved alleles and many alleles all of which are dealing with a binary trait which then causes variant behavior based on environment and other genetic factors, it even explains the reaction to vaccines (the combination of the environment of a hospital or doctor's office, which is typically stressful sometimes to the point of pain for us, and the shock and pain of the injection add up to the individual mentally turtling in order to avoid further suffering) and history (changelings, historical figures who were likely autistic, descriptions of behavior that had similar commonality as ASD but was almost entirely in the high functioning range, ASD not really showing up until an area becomes industrialized and average functioning improving as technology becomes less disruptive on the senses). In short any attempt to connect ASD to vaccines or chemicals is incorrect, especially when you consider that ASD can be diagnosed at six months of age and it's been shown that the autistic brain is structured differently on a fundamental level (there are some areas of the brain that differ from NTs and the autistic which cannot be changed after they form, or at least not as much as they would need to be). A child is autistic from conception, the child is never lost but the idea of the child must change otherwise they lose a parent."

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390717937.0,"&gt;why couldn't prehistoric aquatic animals still be living? I consider this because so little of the ocean has been explored.

So... In what sense would you consider something prehistoric?  There are  various creatures that are evolved from  but not radically different than our understanding of dinosaurs or their contemporaries.  Think alligators or many species of sharks and jellyfish.  

In terms of the ocean though.  Well.. see here's the thing.  When we say we've only explored 10% of the ocean floor, or even 10% of the ocean it's not that there's a giant circle you can draw between new Zealand and Tahiti and say 'no one has been there'.  It's a matter of depth.   Marine creatures move - a lot.  We'd known about giant squid for a long time even without finding any by their beaks in whale carcasses and the bodies that wash upon the shore, and lots of decent sizes fish travel all over the bloody place.  

But the unexplored part of the ocean is the deep part.  And what we know about why we can't explore - related to water pressure, what we know  about the creature we do find down there  etc. is that we're not likely to be finding anything particularly iconicaly dinosaur - like.  Most of the stuff that lives in the really deep water we don't go around in very often has some fairly unique evolutionary traits to cope with where  they are.  Soft squishy bodies, no eyes, wacky circulatory systems etc.   

It's certainly possible there are sea creatures with bodies that sink when they die or have no obvious bones or parts that we can pull out of digestive systems.  But odds are if there was something  down there of any serious  note that was more dinosaur like than we see regularly we'd have found  evidence of it at one  point or another.

cr42,college,1390718825.0,"My pleasure. I do a lot of science outreach and I tutor for a living, so I always enjoy coming across people who are passionate about science. 

Taking 3 AP science courses, especially during your junior year, is something that'll really challenge you and expose you to the different disciplines. I'm not sure how far you are with your mathematics curriculum, but if you're in a position to take college math courses at a community college (or university) nearby and think that you would enjoy the challenge, I would recommend it. For example, my school didn't offer an accelerated math track, so instead of sitting through a year of pre-calculus as a junior, I ought to have been taking pre-calculus and then calculus through a nearby community college. This might vary, though, depending on your school (how easily the credits would be accepted by your high school, whether there would be an impact on your GPA, etc.), so talk to your counsellor before you really start considering something like that. 

As for Intel, I recommend reaching out to professors at nearby universities. Find ones who are doing work in an area of interest to you and explain yourself (you're a talented high school student with an interest in the sciences); tell them what it is about *their research* that interests you. If you, as a high school student, can look at their publications and get out enough comprehension to communicate something that interests you, professors are going to take notice. 

One thing you should keep in mind, though, is that you have to be persistent and you have to realize that being told *no, there's no room in my lab* is not a knock on you personally. Most college students frequently get turned down from labs in which they express interests, and it's just part of life in a research university. The thing to remember is this: *it only takes one ""yes"" to get you in business*. Start looking at pages for universities near you, send emails to professors, go stop by campus if you can! You can do this, but if you want a shot at winning, you first need a professor who believes in you; they're out there, *you just have to find them*! "

Malavai,TeraOnline,1390719145.0,"The two most populated servers are Mount Tyrannas and Tempest Reach. One is PvP, the other PvE. 

DISCLAIMER: These are all generalized observations based on my experiences in each server. I'm speaking about the community as a whole. The GUILD and FRIENDS you choose to surround yourself with will have a *much* larger impact than anything else. 


MT is, generally speaking, competitive. There is an abundance of PvP guilds which cater to every skill level, playtime hours, and style. Guild rivalries are intense and long-standing - that is, if you're joining one of the ""big guilds"" (""big"" not referring to size, but to activity in the PvP scene, strength, etc). There's a great ""us against them"" feeling which is really exciting. Smaller (and ""less important"") guilds have fewer and less spirited rivalries.

MT's competitive spirit also works its way into PvE - higher performance is expected of you, and strangers can be very nasty to those who aren't playing to their standards, but the tradeoff is that dungeon runs are faster and smoother. Every NA first dungeon achievement was won on Mount Tyrannas. So yes, in the plainest sense of the word, the PvP server *is* better at PvE than the PvE servers are.



There's a big difference in mindsets on a PvE server. There's less ego and elitism - though that's not to say they don't exist! There's less competitiveness. People won't give you as much shit if you mess up, but this also means that people are comfortable with being just ""okay"" or even ""bad"" in dungeons - so runs will be a little slower and there might be a hiccup or two.

While there *are* PvP-focused guilds on TR, you have fewer to choose from. It might be a bit harder to find one that's suited to you.

Overall, your GUILD will make a larger difference in your experience than your server. There are guilds of every personality on both servers. Find one that's perfect for you."

I don't think aloe works very well for just dry damaged skin. If you had a sunburn, it might help. Itching or redness might be helped with aloe, but it stings when I use it that way.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390719391.0,"Ontario Hydro was a crown corporation, (owned by the government) the debt still exists and is owed  by the province, as part of the legislation that split up the company the government imposed the  fees.  

The relevant successor companies (OPG, Hydro one, and couple of others) are all crown corporations as well, though the intent was to make them private that hasn't happened yet.  So while Ontario Hydro as a product label doesn't exist, the practical reality of all of the assets and  debts of the corporation still existing are still in place. 

&gt;and anybody not buying power from the government hydro companies has to pay a 'Global Adjustment' to bring their rate up to the governments rate.

Crown monopolies.   

&gt;What can I do as a consumer to fix the system?

Pay the fees, vote for people who support building nuclear power plants if you want cheap power, vote for people who support Wind/Solar/etc. if you want enviro friendly power without nuclear waste but that costs more.  Make more  money, pay more tax to lessen the debt burden the province is under, vote for federal politicians who have  policies that would be  pro ontario rather than pro - anywhere other than ontario.  

The UK used to have a Crown Monopoly on Salt, Gandhi staged a mass nonviolent protest and marches to the ocean with a huge collection of followers and made salt.  I suppose in that sense you could build your own nuclear power station and offer to sell power to get prices down, but well, that's actually what they want you to do.  No one has been crazy enough to try and make any serious private investment in the  power business in Ontario.

This is my advice:

1.  Make sure you are safe. This is your primary concern. You're at your grandma's house now. Do you feel safe going home? If not, can you stay with grandma? When can you go get your things? Is there anyone that can go with you? Are there other adults you can get involved in this? 

2. It is up to you whether you want to call CPS on him or not. I think it would be a good idea to get a paper trail going, even if the investigation doesn't go anywhere. 

3. You are not your mom. Even if she decides to go back, you don't have to. You have to do what is right for you. Don't listen to any nonsense about keeping the family together, or just forgiving him, or ""you provoked him."" Even if you did, what he did was still wrong. He hurt a defenseless kid--someone in his care--someone he's supposed to protect. 

4. You are not obligated to forgive him. Not ever. If he's a good person, he's going to see very quickly that what he did was wrong and he will abjectly apologize and promise it will never happen again. And even if he does all this, and you 100% believe him,YOU ARE STILL NOT OBLIGATED TO FORGIVE HIM.

Again, I am so sorry that this happened to you. You must be feeling so angry and betrayed and hurt right now. This is normal. Just hold on and remember that this is not your fault and that he had no right, ever, to do what he did. Take care of yourself."

They might be conservatives, liberals, social democrats, constitutional monarchists, whatever. Many students, unemployed people, children of the middle class, etc, support socialism and have working class politics. This doesn't make them workers any more than a conservative shithead supporting capitalism makes him/her a capitalist. Just call people what they are.

But there is lack of profitable creative innovation that the West is so damn good at producing(though in America it is dying now...with my generation and younger), and 80s people grew up in era of unffetered capitalism, perhaps they feel rather bullish, and think they can profit highly once things go on the rise..

It's best to keep the breakup convo short, to have their stuff with you to give back to them, and to not get into ""this is the list of shit you did that made me not love you."" 

Most memorable breakup I had is with a guy who was really volatile. In my stupid youth, I took him emotional instability as passion and put up with his blow-ups for a few months. Then he decided to pick an actual physical fight with my downstairs neighbor over something really stupid and I realized that this guy was nothing but endless problems (that were always someone else's fault) and that I didn't need this shit in my life.

I broke up with him, but he refused to get his stuff out of my apartment. He kept putting it off. A few weeks later, I'm moving and I decided to be nice and bring him his shit. BIG MISTAKE. He got mad that some of it got wet (it began to rain and it was in the back of my truck) and *chased me down the street, yelling.* 
Every few years he tracks me down on Facebook or some place and apologizes. Then starts in with a bunch of emotional manipulation and drama-llama behavior until I block him. This has been going on for like 10 years now. "

1. Insurance follows the car, not the person. You can't insure a car you don't own. You can't insure something before you have insurance. So basically, buying insurance after the accident was pointless for all three reasons.

2. No, you have no case in court. The judge will say that you should have asked. You have a duty to ask whether the vehicle is insured. What you can do is just fess up that you didn't know and trusted your dad and ask the court to lower the cost of the ticket.

3. If you cracked the bumper of the other car, the cost will definitely exceed $750 (unless it's an old car.) Just FYI--be prepared for a bill for $1200 or somewhere in that area. You also own the other driver a rental for the time his/her car is in the shop (or rather, you dad does.)

4. Is the other driver insured? Are they going through their carrier? Likely, that insurance company will settle with your dad, as he has no insurance (the liability is his, btw. He's responsible for paying for the accident, not you. You have to pay the ticket but, unless you stole his vehicle, he's legally liable for any damages that result from any permissive user of his vehicle.)

I know that it's frustrating and difficult to function on little sleep, but it doesn't last forever. There is nothing worse than finding out how bad something was for your child's mental health after you've already done it (which happened to me a lot with my first baby). I totally understand your frustration. My daughter woke at night till she was 2.5. My only survival mechanism was cosleeping and I learned to absolutely love it. It brought us very close and I feel like her life went by a lot slower than my son's. It's not for everyone, but if that's what helps you get through the night wakings, there's nothing wrong with it and it's only our culture that puts it down. People have been sleeping with their young children for thousands of years. It's natural.

The message itself is ambiguous in the sense that ""foreigner"" is, obviously *anyone* who isn't ""native"" Swiss.

That point aside, the SVP wouldn't be itself without racism and xenophobia in general.

Most popular targets are, as with the far-right across Northern and Western Europe, anyone ""swarthy"" and Mediterranean looking, or Indo-Iranian looking, or African, or ""Eastern""-- so any sort of Slavic person, and of course the Romas.  

The idea being that if there's one person of criminal intent or who's bad in any way from these ""undesirable"" ethnic/racial groups, then they all are and ideally they should all be deported through persuasion or force.

SVP also has a huge hard on (which they use as a shield against accusations of racism) for Swiss Jews and Zionism. Not at all untypical of the racist right/far right in Northern and Western Europe."

The Man From Earth is the worst movie I've ever seen that was recommended to me by the internet.

There is *nothing*, absolutely *nothing* that the movie got right, and sucks at a level that grinds into my brain like a drill.

The movie is a table read for a student film, one in awful need of a re-write. It's the status quo of a better film. A magazine article. This movie's premise would be the first 6 minutes of a real movie, then something interesting would happen, and we'd have a story.

I saw this piece of shit because some nerds voted it on imdb and it made a list on icheckmovies.

cyranothe2nd,AskHistorians,1390723280.0,"Going off this, when American education became public and widely available, there was a push toward making it accessible for all students. Especially after the Industrial Revolution, schools were interested, not in creating a ruling class, but in creating compliant workers. For instance, in 1899 William T. Harris, the US commissioner of education, celebrated the fact that US schools had developed the “appearance of a machine,” one that teaches the student “to behave in an orderly manner, to stay in his own place, and not get in the way of others.” Schooling was about imparting a core body of knowledge. While some of the Classics were considered a part of this core body until recently (and some still are), the education of the elite--with fluency in Greek and Latin--wasn't something the American system really wanted to achieve.

Also, early in the 20th century there was an emphasis towards changing the standard of education in two ways--first, to make education more humane. Second, to inculcate critical thinking as a criteria for the new American school system (so that America could compete in the global marketplace). This meant more emphasis on science and technology, and less on the humanities. And humanities studies trended away from memorization of other's writing and imitation of the forms of the great writers of the past, and focused more on invention, argument and grammar. As humanities education became more inclusive, ""the classics"" were replaced by more modern and diverse bodies of reading.

I guess my favorite holiday is Christmas. All the family getting together for a large dinner is awesome. In last year's my sister even decided to fancy it up by setting a really nice table full of decorations and stuff. Too bad Mother Nature decided we should pray to her instead and sent some rain to mess with the decoration. My poor sister almost cried.

There's his being fed up with your mother-henning and not communicating his resentment and then blowing up at you.

Honestly, I think you've both been incredibly immature over this issue and that it's very likely to end your relationship. If you want this relationship to continue, I think you both need to have a frank talk about things. I think you both need to be honest about your feelings. I think you need to come to some compromise (for instance, why can't he smoke outside?).

&gt; that the Arab nations didn't want any Jews in the area to begin with

They didn't want any Jews in the area or they didn't want Ashkenazim whose closest tie to the land was something written in a book that happened well over 1500 years ago at the time?

I guess the Arab Jews and the Palestinian Jews (the Jews who were actually living alongside Palestinian Arab Christians and Muslims at the time) only came into existence when the Israelis willed them to so that they could tell them to come to Israel, right?

&gt; Furthermore, while Israel spends a significant amount of money on measures to protect their own people (iron dome, bomb shelters, Hamas and the ruling powers in Gaza have barely spent anything.

Aha ahee ahohohoho. I guess you don't hear yourself speak.

I agree, the blockade on Gaza needs to be lifted and all that money going to Israel would be better suited going to rebuild Gaza and make it prosper. That's the only way Hamas is going away and it would be funny to watch the worldwide Jewish community throwing a massive shit-fit and whining and weeping and wailing.

&gt; Believe me, Israel (and I'm sure at least a few of those living in Gaza as well) want nothing more than peace

No, I don't believe you on ""Israel"". The majority want this farcical ""peace"" that grants them as much land as they desire and the Palestinians aren't allowed to do anything about it and have maybe 5% of Palestine that is sovereign.

As for the Gazans-- I can imagine they don't like being clusterbombed and don't like having white phosphorus dropped on them.

Not the best way to make people want to run to you crying ""we accept your terms"".

travelingmama,changemyview,1390724829.0,"This is a fairly common argument in favor of spanking. I still believe it is completely unnecessary to spank a child in these situations. A frantic, panicked reaction followed by immediate removal from the dangerous situation is enough in that moment. Though the spank *may* prevent some children from doing it again, often times it doesn't because it makes the child defensive therefore turning the focus from learning that what he did was wrong to mommy is being unreasonably angry. The best way to prevent a child from getting defensive is to use an I-message, ""I was *scared to death* that you were going to get hit by a car and die!"" Not only do they hear why their action was bad, but also understand how it made you feel which helps them feel remorse because they scared mommy. If this kind of message does not work it's because there is a relationship problem. If your child doesn't care about your feelings (assuming he isn't special needs) then there's something abnormal and you need to work on creating a better relationship and communicating better with your child. 

I just find it absurd to think that you need to hit your child if they are in danger. You just remove them from the danger. Then you can talk about why it was dangerous in order to prevent it from happening again. The shock value comes from your scared response and immediate removal. 

And yes a 5 year old is capable of understanding death. A 3 year old is. They're certainly capable of understanding getting really hurt. They're also very capable of learning about things that are dangerous and don't need pain to learn those things. "
UlgraTheTerrible,bipolar,1390724846.0,"I know lithium works for a lot of people. I... don't want it near me, ever. 

The reasoning is because I'm quite legitimately hypersensitive to medications, or, more specifically, any that will hit my brain. I robotrip if I take two teaspoons of cough syrup with dextromethorphan in it. Seroquel? Naw, can't take more than 25 mg, because the 100 mg they initially put me on to attempt to titrate up to *normal* levels used to treat bipolar (I believe it's about 600 mg) nearly killed me. Caused a ""very rare"" side-effect of dropping my blood pressure to the floor... 

So, by that reasoning, it is *very* unlikely that I wouldn't have some problems with Lithium... And if you read the side-effects, not to mention that you can almost *never* go off Lithium without experiencing a major manic episode as a result... Well. I've already got a history of having rare/unexpected side-effects. 

Fact of the matter is, I'm glad I knew some of that before I made my decision. There is a reason that they give you a choice about it these days and don't just say, ""Well, we're going to put you on Lithium, good luck.""

There are pros and cons to just about every medication. I was lucky enough to have a fairly decent understanding of those before I even knew I was bipolar, and I made my choice accordingly. 

It's really great that lithium works a trick for you, and so many people, but I don't trust it for me, nor do I think it should necessarily be a front line medicine for bipolar, due to the laundry list of things that can go wrong, though really, it is only *slightly* longer than most of our other meds...

Expecting it to ""teach"" the dog a lesson is applying human thought processes on the dog. Show him what to do instead. Put him outside if he makes a mess, then reward him for doing his business out there next time. Don't put his face in it and expect any result.

Also, dominance theory does not exist and has actually been proven to cause aggressive behavior. Read the following:

* [Comments from actual professionals about dominance theory](http://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/14_12/features/Alpha_20415-1.html)

The bottom line is that the ""philosophy"" behind it is bogus. You're intimidating the dog, not helping it learn anything.

There are things that give me hope, though. And I think that's something that SJWs don't do enough of: post things and concentrate on the positive steps that have been made.
Here are some clips from the show ""What Would You Do?"", a hidden camera show done by ABC where actors act out scenes of conflict or illegal activity in public while hidden cameras tape the scene, and  whether or not bystanders intervene, and how they handle the situation, if they do. They've done multiple scenes of dealing with the topic of trans people: 

- [Transgender waitress deals with an ignorant customer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-cRw-YJABM)

- [Father bullies their transgender kid for wanting a dress](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtytuVs-Kks)

- [Teenage boy tells mom he wants to be a girl and the mom throws a fit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRGhmaFv5Vg)

In all of these scenes, 90% of the time, the victims of the ignorance are stood up for and given support.

I seriously wish more people would watch this show too, since it really does show that the world is becoming less and less ignorant to these kinds of things. Yes, there are still assholes, and there will always be assholes. But I feel like constantly pointing out the assholes and never the good people, always seeing the bad and never the positive, is such a miserable way to think."

The best thing to do is to ignore the comments section all together-- at the very least in terms of newspapers like the national post or otherwise sites that are very liberal (in some ways, at any rate) in regard to what people can say.

Stupid, irresponsible comments that have no basis in reality (not caring about a headscarf means you're pro ""honour killing"" (cue massively inflated bullshit statistics that have no source whatsoever), or that the presence of a headscarf means that the person wearing it is ""pro honour killing"" really ought to be filtered out into the ""oblivious person who shouldn't be spouting soundbites and saying things that don't make sense"" category, but then you'd get the idiots claiming their rights were being taken away or something like that."

A couple quick comments/questions:

* would this script fit into the format of the hour ""dramedy"" or would it fit better in the format of a half hour sitcom?
* Try to work on more distinct voices for each characters. I enjoyed a lot of the quips, but there's not a lot of dramatic/comedic driving force between the characters because they all have the same attitudes. 
* Who would you consider the main character of the show? There's a strong sense of ensemble in this piece, but usually a strong lead drives the story. What are your characters goals - in the short term, the longterm, etc. 
* Flesh out dramatic situations. There was huge potential for laughs at the ""He's NOT Matt Bellamy"" part. 
* Check out Linda Aronson's ""Television Writing"" and it's a short book that will give you the groundrules for tv format (4 Act Structure, A-Plot/B-Plot/Plot breakdowns)

palapiku,piano,1390726279.0,"&gt; If someone wants to learn more about the history of the earth or some random subject, and the information to learn it can be easily found online or in some books, they can just go there. Why is it so pivotal that in order to play the piano, you need to take lessons?

If you want to learn *about* playing the piano, you can also do that on your own. For example, you mentioned learning about intervals and foundation behind scales. That's not playing the piano, that's music theory. And you can learn it from a book, just like history of the earth.

If you actually want to learn to *play the piano*, that's different. Playing the piano is a highly complex, highly refined physical activity. You need a teacher because the teacher will be able to see when you do something wrong, and correct you. You will not be able to do that on your own because you don't yet know what kind of movements are wrong (i.e inefficient or unhealthy). Just like when you practice a sport on a high level, you need a trainer.

&gt; And, yes, my second piano teacher did try to get me to do scales and isolate dynamically my left and right hand which I never thought of before.

There you go then. Hand separation is pretty central to playing the piano and you never thought of it on your own. That's why you need a teacher."

simonjp,weddingplanning,1390726423.0,"Man here. I thought you might like to hear about my fiancée's and my experience. 

We went to the Jewellry Quarter (I'll abbreviate) of her home city here in the UK. something like 50 jewellers in the same spot. It meant there was a very big range of service style and price range. Here's the bits I noticed;

As many other have mentioned, I could tell when some vendors saw me as nothing but a roadblock- as the wallet, whose role was just to limit spending. That's annoying. This ring is (nominally) a gift from me to her.

It may be the nature of the Jewellry Quarter, but it was almost uniquely diamonds. I know that coloured stones aren't common but they are becoming more fashionable. I'd've loved for her to have least tried on a sapphire, perhaps. 

I struggled to find anywhere that dealt in ethical stones. I would've been willing to pay over the odds for a stone that didn't give me a little pang of guilt when I look at it. I think the vendors knew this too- it was the one aspect that left a bad taste, as they were quite dismissive of my question. 

Most ladies here have said is ""only show me what I've asked for"". Well, that wouldn't have worked for us- my other half had a very clear idea if what she was looking for, but ended up with something quite different, because the vendor noticed she wasn't quite sure about it. So perhaps the (unfortunate for you) answer is ""know when they're set on something and know when they're not sure"". Perhaps that's more like ""now I know you've already decided, but I wouldn't be doing my job very well if I didn't at least let you try on a different style, just so you can be sure. Plus, when will you be wearing another one of these again? :-)"" I think saying the smilie at the end is crucial.

Also I just learned from my midwife that heat applied while pushing helps keep blood flowing to your perineum which also prevents more tearing. So water birth or a hot rag will do the trick. 

I will say this, the tightness of your perineum has nothing to do with how good sex feels for your husband. All the tightness that matters to him is in your vagina. When my daughter was born my midwife stitched me up too much (I actually found out from my new midwife that sometimes the hymen gets restitched and that's exactly what happened to me) so every time we have sex it actually tears it a little again. It. freaking. sucks. Certain positions have been painful ever since and she's 3. This time around I am looking forward to tearing at least a little and I am not getting stitched this time, I'm using seaweed. Sounds crazy I know, but I researched it.

JAPH,battlestations,1390726911.0,"""UNIX""

It diverges a ton from UNIX.  While most of the GNU toolchain is available, there are enough subtle differences to waste days of your life (speaking from experience on that one).  The user system is a real bastard to work with, with many different ways to handle permissions, all of which work differently.  A lot of libraries out there haven't been well-tested on OSX, so they break constantly.

I worked in a group of about 50 people doing scientific computing in an HPC context, where about a third of the people used Macs.  They *always* had many more problems getting things to build and run than the Linux and BSD users.  Even the Windows users with Cygwin had better luck.

macports/fink help, but they require that you run two different versions of the various toolchains, because there will be compatibility problems between the Apple and port/fink version.

I used to code on a Mac, but eventually migrated the system over to Linux because it was significantly less painful to work on."

Gabor Mate explains it in [this speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGmADfU5HGU) better than I can explain it, but to summarize, when you yell or use forceful punishment of any kind, the frontal lobe (where learning occurs) shuts off, the child goes into survival fight or flight mode, and you are talking to the lymbic system which does not retain information as well as the frontal lobe. Children are more likely to repeat actions when the teaching occurred while their old brain was activated. By preventing them from getting defensive and stimulating the survival response, they are able to retain that information and learn from their mistakes. "

There's no proof that the Rinnegan can use sharingan abilities. I actually have a good reason to believe that it doesn't. The sharingan had the ability to see chakra flow, and tell if something is a clone or not. During the Naruto-Pain fight, Pain was fooled by Naruto's clones disguised as rubble. This leads me to believe that the Rinnegan does *not* have the same abilities as the sharingan.

EmergencyTaco,SubredditDrama,1390730047.0,"From the OP's website: 

&gt;On December 14, 2012 I posted a $5,000.00 cash reward on my Facebook page and on several Internet message forums, making this reward payable to anyone who could provide PROOF to me that Sandy Hook really happened, and that 20 kids and 6 adults were shot and killed by Adam Lanza using a rifle that the liberal gun grabbers have called ""an assault weapon""  at SH Elementary School on 12/14/2012. Over one year later, NO ONE has attempted to collect the reward.

&gt;On January 1, 2014, I raised that reward to $10,000.00.  I have a standing offer of a $10,000.00 cash reward payable to anyone who can provide me with irrefutable proof that Sandy hook was NOT staged. There are conditions to claim the reward, but anyone with REAL evidence of these deaths should easily collect the reward after a thorough investigation of the evidence presented proves said evidence to be ""irrefutable.""

&gt;To date, NO ONE has attempted to claim this reward.  What does that tell you?

&gt;Claimants must sign a legal contract with me in front of my attorney and a Kentucky Judge.  You will affirm by this contract, that the evidence you provide is accurate and true, and that IT DOES IN FACT PROVE that these 28 deaths (including Adam Lanza and his mother) occurred as we have been told. 

&gt;Claimant will submit collateral of $100,000.00 in value which will be used to secure a proper investigation.  I will pay for this investigation using REAL private investigation firms.  I am prepared to invest up to $100,000.00 into this investigation. 

&gt;If the investigation concludes that the evidence submitted is IRREFUTABLE, I will pay $10,000.00 to the claimant and return claimant's collateral. However, if the evidence proves to be FALSE, the collateral will be seized to compensate me for the costs of the time and money wasted following up on the claimant's 'wild goose chase.'

&gt;False evidence submitted in an attempt to collect the reward will result in prosecution of claimant in BOTH a civil court for Breach of Contract AND in criminal court for the felony of FRAUD, for knowingly submitting false evidence in an attempt to defraud me out of $10,000.00.

&gt;My offer is REAL.  My money is REAL.  If you want to claim the reward, you should make absolutely certain that your ""evidence"" is REAL.  

Here's the TL;DR: ""I've been offering $10,000 to anyone who can prove to me ***IRREFUTABLY*** that the Sandy Hook shooting happened. However, to claim this $10,000 they have to give a collateral down payment of $100,000 and if I don't believe them I get to keep the $100,000 dollars, but if I do believe them I'll pay them back the $100,000 plus $10,000. Since nobody has tried to claim this reward it's obvious that the shooting didn't happen.""

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390730186.0,"To me, her complaints sound more valid than yours.

You both claim you want more sex.  She does initiate, but wants you to initiate more.  This is VERY common with women, particularly those of us with ""responsive libidos"" - http://www.thedirtynormal.com/2010/02/27/do-you-know-when-you-want-it/

If she knows you don't prefer her comfy clothes, and there's been times where she stayed in her work clothes for hours after she got home, only to get no initiation from you - well, why should she bother?  Do you expect her to relax in makeup and nice clothes every night on the off chance you might initiate?  Why do you seem to think bedtime is the only time you can initiate?

You might not like the hobo clothes, but YOU CAN TAKE THEM OFF HER.  Problem solved.  Night creams are the issue?  Initiate before she puts them on.

If she's actually rejected you initiating, then yeah, maybe she's making excuses, but you don't describe that.  Your ""reasons"" actually sound like the excuses here.  I think you're not that interested in sex with her, you really would prefer to jerk off to porn and you're blaming her sweatpants for it, which is kind of ridiculous."

salami_inferno,thewalkingdead,1390730265.0,"&gt; If having a nearby walker works, then why do walkers attack you when you're in a horde?

Because the rest of the walkers in the horde are also trying to eat you. This makes her less noticeable to the other walkers but no invisible, you've seen instances of walkers still taking interest in her even with her walker bitches. So this doesn't make her invisible to them, just makes her less noticeable.

Yes, the issues with delivery and the issues with sparring are present in a lot of dojangs.  This is because they train in a way that is heavily based on sport taekwondo.  In tkd tournaments, it is advantageous to keep your hands low to soften/prevent kicks to the body, and punches essentially do not score points.

girlaboutoaktown,AskMen,1390730994.0,"Yeah, I think if someone still fears being perceived as a slut, they haven't really taken sex-positivity to heart, anyway.  Which I understand can be difficult - people who are raised in a conservative environment might really internalize a lot of those ideas, so even if they're running around having the sex they want, to some degree they still feel shame about it, so they lie.  A terrible basis for starting a relationship.

Dan Savage actually advises that it's fine to ""round down"" with a new partner, but I disagree.  I want to be with someone who accepts my history fully - and I've never had a potential partner be turned off by mine (although, to be fair, I was in a monogamous relationship from 19-25 so that kept my number ""artificially lower"" than it would have been otherwise.

My husband actually has what could be considered a shockingly high number - right around 50 when we met when he was 28.  I think he told me the number on our second date. I was slightly taken aback, but also impressed both with his prowess and his honesty.  And knew that hey, this was a guy who wouldn't judge my sluttier instincts, and I knew I could give in to what I wanted to do and sleep with him on that second date and he wouldn't judge me like some guys would.  Yesterday was our 9 year anniversary so that's worked out pretty well!

Gen_E_Awesome,AskWomen,1390732069.0,"No problem. It helps to start each point with a strong verb. Lots of places like ""managed"" or ""coordinated"" instead if things like ""planned"". Stuff like that. As for interviews, always go for the S.T.A.R method. It's as follows:

Situation: what are the circumstances that lead to whatever problem or challenge you faced, or what exactly was the project you were working on. 

Task: what specifically was your role in this situation, e.g. What was your job title/assignment. If it's a problem, was it caused by you, were you reacting to something? If it's a project, what were your responsibilities and expectations?

Action: what specifically did you do to address or complete your tasks? 

Result: What specifically were the results of your actions? Did it complete your task? Did it solve the problem? What was the short and long term effects on the situation? 

This may seem obvious, but so many people end up blanking on one of them during interviews. Never get caught talking about something you didn't have a positive effect on. If the results didnt solve the problem, don't bring it up.

Even when talking about your ""greatest weaknesses"", the interviewer is really just testing your self awareness of your own flaws. On top of that, they want to know what you're doing to address them and what are the results of that?

Finally, note that I kept mentioning specifics. If you can avoid it, never speak in generalities. People who speak vaguely are often trying to hide the fact that they don't know what they're talking about.

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1390732419.0,"I feel that my relationship is very successful but we're not technically poly, we have an open marriage.  Our ideal situation is both of us having one ore more ""friends with benefits"", but we are not seeking romantic relationships with others (although we recognize that it can happen and are open to renegotiating our agreements if it does).  We've been open for about 5 years out of a 9 year long relationship.

A lot of what I've learned from my experience is that a lot of poly people give bad advice, there's a lot of ""one true way-ism"" and I bought into a lot of the core concepts before that I don't now.  Like the idea that our ""rules/agreements/etc"" have to be equal for the relationship to be healthy, i.e. if I get to do something, he gets to do the equivalent, even if that would drive me crazy and make me feel awful.  Turns out that's a bunch of a crap!  Unequal setups (where one person has more restrictions than the other) can be fine if both partners are 100% OK with that.  Example: Early on we agreed we wouldn't have sex with others in our bed.  I felt strongly about this (to begin with) and he said he was fine with that rule.  Much later, I'd forgotten we had this rule and did just that!  He reminded me later about the rule and I felt awful, but he confessed he actually didn't care about that rule. (Actually, he was kind of turned on by it!)  But if I still cared about him sleeping with others in our bed, that was fine.  I don't anymore, but if I did, it would be fine for us to have that 'unequal' rule.

Another is that more rules/guidelines are better than fewer, with the understanding that they WILL change/evolve over time.  If people avoid making guidelines because they don't want to restrict their partner, and/or because they think they've got ""great communication"" with their partner, so their partner won't do anything that would hurt them, this is 90% of the time going to come back to bite them in the ass.  Since people aren't mind-readers, there's a good chance that even small things that one person is doing that they think is fine can really upset the other.  Now, I'd rather have done a lot of work figuring out my needs/expectations and then coming to my partner and asking for reasonable agreements based on those than just telling him a nebulous statement that he's supposed to try to figure out exactly what actions are allowed based on that.  That's a setup for hurt feelings and drama.

In my experience, most rules/agreements were very necessary in the beginning stages of opening up as a basis of what made us feel secure and safe to explore, and yet as soon as we started, we found ourselves coming back to each other and agreeing that rules x, y, and z weren't necessary after all.  I think this is common for a lot of couples opening up.  But that doesn't mean the rules weren't necessary when they were made.  For us, being able to see that our partner was trustworthy by adhering to the agreements gave us the foundation of trust to be able to eventually get rid of them.

Ultimately though, this is just what's worked for us that I learned over the years that differs from a lot of mainstream poly thinking I used to believe in.  I think the most important principle for couples in non-monogamy is DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU, and don't let anyone else tell you that you're doing it wrong if it's WORKING.  Everyone gets to create their own relationship structure and as long as you're both happy and having fun with a minimum of hurt feelings, it's working!

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1390732939.0,"Curious as to what your scientific basis for the mating habits/relationship structures of hunter/gatherers are, however.  Even in many existing hunter/gatherer tribes, the sexual freedom of women is restricted by men.  I'm sympathetic to the argument that with agriculture/land ownership came patriarchy as a result of the need to control paternity, but my understanding is that there's not a ton of evidence to support the idea that our pre-agricultural ancestors were practicing something we'd see as sexual freedom.

Your last paragraph makes sense to me, but I still hestitate to call ANY kind of relationship structure ""natural"".  Human sexuality is way too adaptable, I think, which I get is kind of what you're saying.  But even in modern western cultures, polyamory doesn't come ""naturally"" to most - although obviously ""lifelong monogamy"" doesn't either.  It seems that both the desire for multiple sexual partners over a lifetime is natural to humans, but so is sexual jealousy.  Every culture/generation/etc will deal with this inherent contradiction a little bit differently with regard to their sexual mores."

As long as no canopies are developed that ensure timely driver egress in any situation, they are a bigger danger to the drivers than open cockpits are. It's simple risk management: do we want to have a feature that is *extremely* vital to driver survival in a wide range of different emergencies - or do we want a feature that helps in a incredibly tiny fraction of accidents and utterly kills drivers in a huge fraction of others? The FIA and the F1 teams have researched canopied several times since 1994, they believe that open cockpits are the way to go.

Also, your claim that such an open-cockpited car hitting a GT car in that manner would lead to fatal injuries is pretty hysterical and completely baseless. But that doesn't even matter, since monopostos will not ever run on the same track at the same time as GT cars. Their safety features don't need to be designed with GT cars in mind. LMP1 and LMP2 cars are a completely different kind of car. E.g. their cockpits have (/are going to have) doors on the sides, which enables driver egress in any orientation after an accident. 

Now, you could argue that monoposto is not the right formfactor for oval racing, i.e. Indycar. *That* would be a valid criticism. "

They have a plethora of things to decide on as an owner in terms of rebuilding because of the mix of new and old players on offense in particular and a defense that has holes that need to be filled all over it.

The Titans are one of the most stacked teams in Madden in terms of the amount of talented young players you can develop. I would say they might be the easiest team to rebuild and develop. 

Personally, I always have a soft spot for rebuilding the Browns, and they have a better corps of youthful skill players than they used to, so that's a little more interesting in this Madden. 

You could always go in a lot of directions with teams like the Jags, Raiders, Bills, Rams, Bears, Bucs, or any of the NFC East teams because of interesting cap situations and a lot of talented players who have their contracts expiring.

I was 25 and he was 29. We broke up when I was 27 and it was kind of on and off for a year. We lived together and it was very serious, very quick.

He never hit me or tried to stop me from seeing friends, but he blamed me for his behaviour and moods.

Would threaten to break up with me over little things. Like me not doing the dishes the way he wanted, if I broke my iPhone or got my leg amputated, due to me having an infection due to a cut.

He called me a fucking retard, kept a dating profile while we were together, bad  mouthed me to his friends and withheld sex from me, but got angry if I didn't want sex.

We had these people living downstairs who were loud, bit annoying but he got really upset. He wrote them an angry note and a few days later their estate agent came up and asked me what the hell happened. He wasn't very polite but said it wasn't right that my ex wrote "" fuck"" and basically threatened them.

I called my ex and told him, and he made me call the police on the agent. I thought it was a bit stupid, but his tone of voice changed and he said if I don't do it, I'm against him. He scared me and I called the cops, crying because I just didn't want to do it. I wish I told them that he made me and I didn't want to.

He did a lot more, but that will just get buried here. It fucked me up big time and he broke up with me, and I almost went into hospital and had a breakdown. It's been three years now and I'm just recovering."

It sounds like this trait of feeling superior may be part of his personality. There may be multiple reasons for this, constant praise from his parents as a child, a certain insecureness(trying to hide that by inflating his ego), too much self-confidence in himself, whatever.

If you want to change that, it will take more than one or two discussions in the time of 6 months. Tell him, in the very moment it annoys you, that whatever he did annoyed you, and explain to him why or how it makes you feel. Do it in a calm voice, maybe ask why he did that(sometimes some of our actions are so ingrained that we don't think about them anymore really). Don't constantly nag like an old wife, but do it every other time or everytime it really annoys you.

He won't change overnight, he might not change at all, but if you like him otherwise, I don't see why trying would hurt. Takes some patience from both parties to get rid of a bad habit.

Emnight,dogecoin,1390738175.0,"So, I'll try to explain what happened.

**What I did was wrong. I know it. I do not regret it, however.**

That's a bold statement, right. Starting by saying I do not regret it and probably would do it again in the same circumstances. Put down your pitchforks, for a second at least, and hear the context.


I was browsing 4chan's Technology board (/g/), more specifically the hourly Dogecoin thread since I was interested in cryptocurrencies and started mining doges.

I saw an hilarious video posted here and thought to post it on reddit, since 4chan and reddit don't really overlap. To laugh and to get karma. **I didn't expect to be tipped for this and I even stated I did not make it in the thread**, once people started to tip me.

DEElekgolo showed up and I planned to give him back the tips (it was no big deal anyway, less than $5). However, /u/dogecointipbot was offline and I went to sleep.

The next day, I saw someone tipped 100k doges. I was impressed but still planned to give it back.

Now, keep in mind I was browsing the internet the week before my finals, as a way to relax and breathe a bit.

The next day my car broke. Which meant I couldn't go to [Douai, where the exams were supposed to take place](http://www.distance2villes.com/distance-douai-a-lille) which is 40km away.

I freaked out and, shamefully, sold the doges to get some paypal money, which I used with my few savings to get my car repaired. 

I had to choose between my internet integrity and failing my exams, or selling my desktop computer I built myself (and I would have barely gotten half what I paid for it). Selling my netbook was a no-no, since it runs on Linux and it's what I use at the uni, for text processing.

I know what I did was wrong, and I felt extremely guilty and ashamed. I sincerely apologize to /u/DEElekgolo for what happened and I can't repay him back.

Another option if the battery life on that might worry you, but you like the smaller size is this one :

 quite a bit more, but it does come with everything you need except juice :) I have not used one but it looks like it has some good features and I have been generally happy over all with my experience with vivi nova's .

PeanutNore,Bass,1390743348.0,"It's generally safe to run a tube amp with a 1:2 or 2:1 mismatch, depending on the quality of the components. It's best to use a matching speaker, though. If you are trying to change the tone of the amp there are better ways to do that than mismatching the impedance. 

For example I've got a Blackstar HT-1 that takes an 8 ohm 8"" speaker, and to make it more friendly for bass and low tuned guitars I replaced the stock speaker with a Dayton Audio DC200-8. It increased the bass response and takes the high end, and because it's less sensitive (88dB vs ~95dB) it's easier for me to really crank the amp and get the power tube breaking up. So there's that. I also try out various tubes in any amp I get to find ones I like, so you might want to try that first."

Hmmm, yeah it's funny how money can help make a career, hmm? I see this everyday in my business. If the artists have rich parents and don't have to worry about making rent, can invest in nice photo shoots, fancy clothes and marketing, and don't have to worry about all the admin stuff, their career just shoots up like crazy in a few months even if they have neither experience nor talent. Then I have some really talented artists that are self-made, dropped out of school, have never gone to university and work barjobs which steal their time from actually being an artist. They live in shitty apartments and scrape together what they can for their publicity materials and do everything on their own and often things like taxes and bookkeeping they do wrong which gets them in trouble.

Reverse racism is the opposite.  It happens when people are trying to be as inclusive as possible.  If for instance a company is trying to hire X people of the majority race, and Y, Z, A, B, C people of other races.  If a person from the majority doesn't get hired, while someone from another race with less skill gets hired, then he can say he was a victim of discrimination.

Basically there is no way to be fair.  It is like dividing allowance between an older and younger son.  The older one thinks it would be fair if he got more, since he is older.  While the younger one wants an equal share.  Whichever way the money is divided, someone will think they aren't getting as much as they can."

i_am_a_freethinker,mormon,1390746200.0,"I'd really tend to disagree, for a number of reasons.

First, I mean the classical term ""freethinker"" as related to [Freethought](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought). From Susan Jacoby's excellent book ""Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism""

&gt;American freethought derived much of its power from an inclusiveness that encompassed many forms of rationalist belief. Often defined as a total absence of faith in God, freethought can better be understood as a phenomenon running the gamut from the truly antireligious - those who regarded all religion as a form of superstition and wished to reduce its influence in every aspect of society - to those who adhered to a private, unconventional faith revering some form of God or Providence but at odds with orthodox religious authority... What the many types of freethinkers shared, regardless of their views on the existence or nonexistence of a divinity, was a rationalist approach to fundamental questions of earthly existence - a conviction that the affairs of human beings should be governed not by faith in the supernatural but by a reliance on reason and evidence adduced from the natural world.

Far from being enslaved to a particular dogma or ideology, freethought relies on reason, nature, and science to derive truths about the natural world. Supernatural claims such as God or the ability of human beings to evolve into deity are not falsifiable, untestable, and therefore completely without merit.

The reason I chose this username is that it conveys exactly where I am, and how I view the world. You can find many similar usernames on this and other related subreddits. Far from bragging, it provides a baseline for my viewpoint on the natural world.

&gt;and thus not free at all.

Are any of us actually free from our beliefs? I assume you are Mormon, and your belief and worldview apply direct and real constraints on how you choose to live your life. 

Finally, I'd have to wonder at the hypocrisy of calling out my username when yours, /u/ifiwereu, could easily be argued to show a micromanaging busybody who tells people how to live their lives.

Which, coincidentally, is exactly what you've done here."

skippydudeah,AskMen,1390747720.0,"Thanks for your questions.  I don't think about this stuff enough.

&gt; What do you value in a person's demeanor?

I can't tolerate lies or dishonesty.  If I find you in a lie, our trust is done.  I'll be constantly interrogating you for the duration of our relationship.  And I'm like Columbo, so don't even try that shit with me.  Be honest and open about EVERYTHING (except for politics and religion).

Don't take offense at everything I say, unless it is play offense.  If you aren't sophisticated enough to not be offended by the ridiculously outrageous things I might joke about, don't engage me in conversation.

By the same token, don't be afraid to call me out on the stupid stuff I come up with.  Be prepared to have a rational discussion, if I pursue it.

Keep response time to a minimum.  If I text you, don't wait a day to get back to me, even if you are busy.  If I call you, answer your phone, usually I'm not going to call you because I just want to shoot the shit.

&gt; How much does the person's style of dress influence your opinion of them?

Mostly, I pity those who dress outside the norm.  They have to suffer with the stares and the looks from people who have small minds.  Sometimes, it is a little off-putting, initially.  I'd have a hard time not being distracted by a spike through the nose or the big ear-lobe stretching thingies.  Pink hair, mohawks, tatoos up the neck... it's always hard to know if that is a cry for attention or a way to ego differentiate that just went a little too far.

&gt; Would you rather a person to tell you they can't do a particular task outright, or instead at least try with probable faliure?

Try with probable failure.  And by try, I don't mean a passive aggressive half-hearted try.  I mean a full-blown-I'm-giving-110%-to-the-team-because-I-believe-You-wouldn't-have-asked-me-to-do-it-unless-I-could try.

&gt; How do I hold a conversation with you?

Sorry, I'm not going to be able to help you there.  I suck at small talk.  I'm currently enrolled in SmallTalk 099 (Remedial) at the local community college.  I can get worked up about politics and religion, but those topics should be avoided at all costs.  I'm not really into sports, but a lot of guys my age are.  I don't really care for actors and actresses.  It's a tough question.  Talking about the day's events and exploring how everything went down and why is often ok.

&gt; Is there anything that makes you lose respect or get annoyed instantly?

Dishonesty.  Disloyalty.  Constantly being late (which see: dishonesty).  Not answering the phone.  Quitting (except bad habits).  Lack of sympathy/empathy.

&gt; What actions can I take to gain your respect as an equal?

Yah.  So, I'm an older guy.  You want my respect as an equal, go to college and get a graduate degree in a field of your choosing.  And then support yourself for a while without any help from your family.  Or, pick something to do that you can make a living on and live on your own for a while, without support from parents or family.  Become an independent person, then let's talk about equality.

&gt; Would you/have you ever consider a teenage girl as your equal?

Equal in humanity and the suffering we will face, but not equal in experience, education, or capabilities.  When I was a teenaged boy, I considered teenaged girls my equals for the most part.  

*Edit: clarified equality answers, grammar."

You can get a system where instead of running the copper pipe to the furnace, you run it room-to-room like a radiator pipe (just drilling holes in the walls if you don't mind running the pipe outside the wall) and have a blower in each room."

prot3llo,sweden,1390748500.0,"Om du läser min kommentar igen så ska du nog se att jag aldrig sa något om att de är nazistiska. Tror du blandar ihop mig med personen som skrev första kommentaren i den här diskussionen. En till sak jag vill tillägga är att man kan vara nazist utan att stödja just det politiska partiet, är övertygad om att många nazister stödjer andra partier än SvP. Med det sagt **tror** jag faktiskt att de är vinklade och jag tror definitivt att deras målgrupp är extremhögern.

""Miss"" använde jag av ironi, ska sluta med det framöver. Jag tror helt ärligt inte att Affe är så dum att han inte kan avrunda rätt, jag tror att det är med flit de flesta gånger men jag kan ha fel där. Självklart handlar statistik mycket om analys, och det är hans analys som är intressant här. Det är den vi diskuterar. Vill man inte se den kan man hålla sig till Brås dokument i ämnet. Det är också hans analys som är manipulerad (se mitt sista exempel). Vad kan han ha för motiv till en sån fintning med siffrorna? Eller tror han på riktigt att han räknat på ett riktigt sätt? Hur som helst, är han en lämplig källa för en tidning som du vill bedyra inte har något intresse av nazism och rasism? 

&gt; Tycker du andra skribenter i ämnet är lika ärliga, eller döljer de istället gränsdragningen?

Eftersom jag inte nämt andra skribenter vet jag inte vad de har med saken att göra. Vilka skribenter syftar du på? Ska jag luskamma internet efter fler att såga? Jag sågar allt jag läser, jag gillar att vara nogrann i min källkritik och uppmuntrar andra till detsamma. Det finns väldigt få enskilda källor på internet man bör lita på till 100% då man sällan vet mycket om författaren eller ansv. utgivare. Därför Wikipedia aldrig är en ok källa, då privatpersoner ofta får skriva artiklar och ange egna källor. Då wikipedia inte är vinstdrivande finns inte resurser att kolla igenom alla artiklar omedelbart och vissa artiklar är alltså inte 100% sanningsenliga. 

Översimplifieringen har lite med saken att göra, den kan jag egentligen förlåta, de 1000 talet brott av tot. nästan en och en halv miljon han lägger på sina siffror är suspekta, men blir helt ointressanta efter man sett att han knäpper med fingrarna och förvandlar 0,12% till 33,33% och dessutom applicerar det på sin stapel igen. 

För mig skadar det Fria Tiders trovärdighet i att de inte är vinklade när de länkar till han precis som jag inte gillar AB/Exp efter många tveksamma källor och ibland vågade ändringar i formuleringar från källans orginalspråk. Men det är min åsikt, gillar du inte den behöver du inte det. 

Edit: [Ett exempel](http://www.friatider.se/sverige-toppar-internationell-valdtaktsstatistik) på vågade ändringar i formuleringen. Eller snarare fel i faktan som visas. I länken till deras källa (FN-rapporten) kunde jag först inte hitta dokumentet de syftar på. Efter att ha klickat runt lite hittade jag ett dokument som berörde sexuellt våld och våldtäckt. Där kan man se andra siffror, Sydafrika är dessutom inte heller listat som i artikeln. Jag kan ha missat något här, dubbelkolla gärna. "

So, if the race is meh with a stat (or caps out really quickly; if your Str starts at 8, there's not a whole lot of room from improvement), go with +1/+0/+0.

Mongoosen42,explainlikeimfive,1390748916.0,"&gt;the USA and UN forces declared war to try to reunify the country

No. The North declared war on the South and had the southern forces relegated almost all the way down to Busan before the US and the UN got involved in an effort to protect their interests in the region.

It should also be noted that the Soth Korean governments were equally oppressive and totalitarian for several decades after the Korean war. The first democratic president was in 1987 which is when the current era of governance began. This is the 6th republic (6th constitution) of South Korea, but before 1987 there were a string of dictators and coups and assassinations. Actually, the current president is the daughter of one of the more famous/infamous military dictators. 

And while such details are larglely unreported/unknown in the west, the South has some eyebrow raising policies. For example, protests are illegal here. Well, for all intents and purposes. In order to protest, one must first obtain a permit (issued by the administration that one would be protesting) and then, after having received said permit, only one person may be in attendance at the protest. Furthermore, the media here is said to be pretty tightly controlled. Certainly political criticisms never make the nightly news. Though to what extent the media is controlled by the government is difficult for me to discern as a foreigner living here.

So actually, what differentiates the South from the North is not politics or totalitarianism so much as economic philosophy. THAT is the big difference. The South may not have death camps (anymore) but there is a history of political oppression (and a continued potential for it) that should not be overlooked. Rather, the way that the two countries really diverged was in the South Korea acceptance and embrace of capitalism. That's the biggest difference. The South embraced trade, embraced and learned to value industry. The current presidents father mandated working conditions that would shock and amaze us in the west, but the result of his regime was unparalleled economic growth.

So as a result, South Korea has money, and it has a lot more contact with the outside world (and  thus a lot more invested in having good relations with other countries), and so it tries to keep its dirty laundry more hidden because they don't want their business partners thinking bad things about them. Were it not for all of that, the South could easily be just as bad as the North."

When you buy a Product on a shop, like the linked one, you aren't paying (at least, not direct) this 60% import tax. There is a bunch of sales taxes (ICMS, ICMS-ST - which can be up to 25% - IIRC), and some product related taxes (IPI, COFINS...). These taxes related on Product, are quite expensive as well.

So, to help even more, USDBRL rate is raising considerable lately. It's around 2.4 BRL per USD; (Which, I daresay still low, but let's not focus on it); To give some idea, it was about 1.5 BRL per USD back in 2011.


Even with all those factors, tax, exchange rate, this still really overpriced. But it's normal that a mobile phone retail price on launch is quite high.

rbaltimore,Parenting,1390749140.0,"Former foster care caseworker here. While I advocate the use of a lawyer in every kind of situation except speeding tickets, CPS is actually disinclined to involve themselves in many cases reported to them. They are going to take the OP's case pretty seriously, her daughter's injury is severe and daycare cases are always heavily scrutinized, some of the hypothetical cases described in this thread would likely not merit involvement by CPS. In almost every part of the US, CPS and Foster Care are severely overloaded. They are understaffed, underfunded, and caseworkers are routinely over the legal limit for the number of cases. In fact, I was brought on specifically to get my coworkers back under the legal limit. CPS does not have the time or resources to due more than a basic investigation for cases that are not very severe. In fact, this lack of resources for investigation sometimes results in children falling through the cracks and dying of abuse and/or neglect. CPS workers are not inclined to see every case as something that needs involvement, in fact they are more inclined to see cases in the context of ""is this actually a misunderstanding?"" By all means, get a lawyer, I certainly would, but situations where innocent families are torn apart by CPS are the exception, not the rule."
Kalivha,chemistry,1390749148.0,"Okay, here's how I see this:

I've had point group symmetry pop up extensively in about 5 modules across my degree, and space group symmetry in two. The advanced courses just kind of assume we can do this stuff so they're not as explicit about it anymore.

So it's definitely useful to know; that being said, I'm in theory and I do not use those kinds of groups for what I do right now.

*But* I do use group theory on different (specifically Lie) groups. Learning the mathematics side of it will potentially make the chemistry side easier (because you get a very clear idea what a group *is*) and it's a thing that can be used in a lot of different contexts. I think the crystallographic point groups are probably the only ones that you'll ever *need* if you want to do experimental inorganic, for interpreting spectroscopic results and such, but group theory is great for understanding all sorts of things (relativity becomes quite trivial to understand once you can describe it in terms of [other kinds of] symmetry groups, for example)."

Great for front squat, high bar squat, and low bar squat (for me at least), OHP, even bench pressing. Didn't like them for deadlifts personally.

A woman should have dominion over her own body, and the major difference here is that an abortion is terminating a fetus.  If a man chooses not to be a father to a child that actually will *continue to exist* even though he has decided to opt out of fatherhood, then yeah, he's a deadbeat.

When a man has sex with a woman, he must be aware of the risk of a conception, and that in the event a child is conceived, that woman has complete and total control over whether or not it's born.  No exceptions.  A man who has an equal hand in creating a human being should have an equal hand in raising that human being.

These are not the same thing.  This comparison is a load of crap.  If a woman had a child, and decided she didn't want to be a mother after it  was born and left all the responsibilities with the father, she'd be a deadbeat, shitty mother!  Jesus Christ, reddit.  The front page with this shit?

Lirkmor,askscience,1390749943.0,"Even when liquid is not at its boiling point, there will be an equilibrium between molecules in the liquid phase and those in the gas phase. Consider a saturated salt solution in water - the solids at the bottom of the container are not static, but rather are constantly dissolving a tiny bit while more salt is deposited from the solution. You can shift this equilibrium by changing the temperature or adding more water. In this analogy, however, the dissolved salt ions are trapped in the container and will remain in the system, meaning the concentration of salt is fixed.

With a patch of liquid open to the air, however, the molecules that have enough energy to ""dissolve"" into vapor can be removed from the system entirely. When they diffuse away, there is no longer an appropriate concentration of water nearby to maintain the equilibrium between water and vapor, so when more molecules evaporate, they are not replaced. This leads to the puddle of liquid drying up completely. This kind of process, based on Le Chatlier's principle, is used to drive some chemical reactions to completion by removing the desired product, which allows more of that product to form. If you have a puddle in an area where the air is already saturated with water - like a bathroom after a hot shower - it won't evaporate very quickly because the molecules won't have anywhere to go.

Boiling is a special case of evaporation where the temperature of the bulk ""reactant"" (liquid water) is raised such that the vapor pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure. The added heat imparts enough energy to the water molecules for more of them to vaporize and escape - at higher altitudes, less energy is needed because atmospheric pressure is lower. Because we generally boil water in an open container, the gas will diffuse and the pot will eventually boil dry. However, you can create a container that captures the gas and condenses it again in a process called reflux. We use that technique in chemistry a lot to avoid wasting solvent during long high-temperature reactions."

En religiøs person er betydeligt sværer at assimilere end en der er rimelig ligeglad med religion. Vi stiller jo ikke spørgsmål om dem der allerede er en del af vores samfund, men vi skal stille spørgsmål om dem der gerne vil være en del af det. Jeg synes det helt fair at vi sætter lidt for religiøse mennesker længere nede på listen da deres holdninger normalt er modsat den typiske ligeglade danske holdning til religion.

Hvis jeg skulle vælge mellem at lade en religiøs kristen eller en agnostisk ateist ind i landet ville jeg da klart vælge ateisten, hvis alle andre kriterier altså var de samme. Ateisten har simpelthen mindre der holder ham eller hende tilbage for at tilpasse sig ind i vores samfund. Det gør det lettere for os alle sammen.

Hvis du blot vil lade alle ind i landet og nægter at kigge på visse mere eller mindre vigtige ting i folks portfolio fordi det ikke lige er politisk korrekt så får du aldrig en immigrations politik der virker. Tro det eller lad være, men folks holdning til religion *er* relevant."

I am in a sports business discussion seminar over the winter term for school. One of our assignments was to read an article in [The Best American Sports Writing - 2013](http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Sports-Writing-2013/dp/0547884605), then create a summary and response to present in class with the intent of fostering discussion on the subject. I picked this article, and had my eyes opened to a problem that I could have guessed existed, but not to the extent this article spells out.

Below is part of my summary and response for the mobile users here, along with some additional sources used. (While appreciated, no need to offer minor grammar/structure corrections - the assignment has already been submitted for grading)

I highly encourage you to read the entire linked article, and the articles listed at the end of this post. I hope the wall of text below could serve as a discussion starter for a very serious issue that is a big threat to the longevity of the NFL.

###The NFL's Secret Drug Problem
---
---

The article is about the NFL’s secret problem – current and former players are addicted to pain killers, and the NFL is not only the cause but also somewhat encouraging it. At the beginning of the article we meet Ray Lucas; he is a former NFL player who spent time with the Jets, Ravens, and Patriots over his career, and he just received an epidural. Why is he getting the epidural? Because he is in major pain due to injuries suffered while playing in the NFL, and will be receiving surgery for said injuries in a few weeks. However, this is the end of the journey – not the beginning.  Lucas has been addicted to pain medication that numbs his pain. His routine before an intervention was 6 to 8 Vicodin in the morning, 6 Percocet at lunch, and even more to go to bed. Such a cocktail of pain medication is deadly since it can numb the senses beyond safe operating levels. Lucas was incapable of feeling anything, let alone the pain. Before finding P.A.S.T. (Pain Alternatives Solutions and Treatments, a addiction and pain rehab center), Lucas was taking 800 pain pills a month, closing in on bankruptcy, and wanting to commit suicide; he was not alone.

The article goes on to list many testimonials from players about how the NFL would give out powerful pain narcotics without any questions asked in order to manage the pain received on a daily basis when playing. To quote the article directly, Fred McCrary said “your body ain't made to go through a wall 50, 60 times a game… they’d give you what you wanted – and, still, guys smoked weed for the pain.” The need for such high-powered pills is creating addicts of the players, and it’s leading them to ruin after they leave the game. The injury toll isn’t new to anyone who follows the game, but the article details the hidden scandal that is unheard of in the general population – since the 1980s, doctors and trainers have given players millions of high-powered pain pills in order to keep the players practicing and playing in games. This unregulated dispersal of drugs is creating opioid abuse among current and especially former players as they become dependent on the drugs to relieve the pain from injuries sustained while playing in the NFL.

The amazing part is how the former players harbor no resentment towards the NFL, their former teams, or the opposing players that dealt the life-altering injuries. In fact, many players have a fondness towards their former coaches and trainers who would not only allow them to play through serious injury, but would facilitate it. McCrary remembers lines of players waiting to get shot up with Toradol, an anti-inflammatory drug, before the game. At halftime they would be given painkillers to push through injuries. The trainers would give out these meds with no questions asked, essentially fueling the mentality that the drugs were just part of the routine. On the plane ride back, win or lose, the place would be full of alcohol and drugs to dull the pain from the previous game. Teams would use the team doctor’s DEA license to order these drugs by the bulk and then give them out to players without the doctor’s authorization. On top of that, players would get extra prescriptions outside of the team for additional drugs, leading to insane diets of pills.

The article then details the addiction and rehab of Ben Smith, former Philadelphia Eagle Pro-Bowl safety. Smith would nearly have his life ruined by an addiction to opioids, only able to recover after months of rehab and alternative treatment for his injuries. He tore 3 knee ligaments, had a bad surgery, and then tried to play on a not-completely-healed knee. The resulting overcompensation would result in back and neck problems. The pain would be intense as he finished his career, requiring drugs. This would create an addiction that would tear through his savings, forcing him to take unskilled jobs and forcing his family into the ghetto. Many tragedies would occur because of that, with the main ones being his niece accidentally discharging a gun (that they had for protection), killing herself, and his children and nieces falling into destructive habits. Smith and Lucas would both testify that the addictions had ruined their home life and families as well as their bodies.

The NFL adamantly denies that this culture exists. The head of NFL drug monitoring denies that players have this access to drugs and that the drug testing is there to catch the abuse. All the players scoff at the idea, saying that they were on the drugs nearly constantly and stating that the NFL would have to suit up the ball boys if they suspended players using the painkillers at this rate. Former NFL doctors, like Dr. Alex Stalcup, testify that nothing has changed. In fact, they say the problem has gotten worse as the game has gotten faster and more brutal. They say that even though the league has tried to crack down on the unrestricted access to the pills, the players essentially have swap meets in the locker room for pills they get from outside doctors. Star players will go to Florida and get dozens of prescriptions without any questions ask, and then give those pills to teammates. The article ends with the reveal of Lucas’ eventual recovery after a couple of surgeries and major rehab. Pain and pain-killer free, Lucas returned home to his family finally able to take walks free from pain and enjoy his family.

When researching this, it was amazing that the League could possibly deny the usage of the drugs. ESPN’s Outside the Lines investigated this subject back in 2013 and found that 52% of NFL players surveyed used opioids during their careers. Of that group, 71% admitted to misusing the drugs and abusing prescriptions.^3 The NFL Players Association itself has conducted surveys and stated that it knew players were using and abusing prescription opioids. What was more dumbfounding was how little coverage there was of this issue in the NFL. When searching the internet for stories around opioid abuse in the NFL, I could only find a handful of articles. One of them dates back to 2006, and essentially states that no one cares about drug abuse in the NFL as long as it’s not steroids or something to gain the upper hand.^2 The NFL wants players to play, even if it’s through major injuries. What’s even more telling is how it appears that the NFL and its teams are trying to cover up the issue. Sports Illustrated ran a piece that brought an interesting revelation to the discussion – teams are saying that players have “flu-like symptoms” when in fact they are probably struggling to handle with their pain medications.^1 It makes me wonder what else we don’t know, and it is terrifying to think that it could be worse that what this article details. The NFL has an apocalyptic storm on the horizon, and it appears to have its head buried firmly in the beachhead made up of money. It makes me wonder: with many issues regarding concussions to player safety, could this revelation be the nail in the coffin for the NFL if it continues to obfuscate the truth?

mimsy191,weddingplanning,1390751210.0,"We're still in the process of finding a ring, and we've been to three places so far, with three very different experiences. 

The first two were small non-chain places in my hometown. We went in pretty much clueless on what we wanted, only that I preferred white gold and something simpler. 

The first of these two stores was fantastic. The woman was pleasant and you could tell she cared about pleasing us. We weren't planning on buying right that day, and she was ok with that. She spent about 45 minutes with us, if I recall correctly - she made an effort to help is figure out what we liked, what we didn't, narrowed it down, etc. She explained how the price is determined, and so on. She talked to both of us, not just me. I found and fell in love with this black opal a while back, and she was happy to discuss custom rings with us to put that stone in the shoulders. She basically went through all of our options with us, and was patient with our cluelessness, and all in all, treated us like customers. She didn't talk down to us (this is important especially with how the second went). We still haven't bought it yet, but my boyfriend is wanting to go back to them when we do. 

The second was right down the street. We went in the same day. I was disappointed. When we talked after, he was also disappointed. We both felt like the woman there didn't take us seriously. Yes, we are younger. No, we weren't planning on buying right then. But how you treat us will help us decide whether we're coming back. She spent the whole time sitting there basically asking, ""well what do you like?"", and when I told her we weren't sure yet, she seemed really clueless herself, and just started showing us stuff with very little explanation or questions. I found her very unhelpful, as though she didn't fell we were worth her time, or were inconvenient to her. Feeling like a burden or an inconvenience is the last thing you want your customers to feel, especially on such a major purchase. 

The third was a Peoples store, and they were better than the second, but at the same time, there was, again, disappointment. She asked our budget, and when we told her, she used financing and such as a means to jack up our budget to almost twice what we were planning to spend. She even made us apply to financing right there even though we were really just looking. I felt like she was trying to force the sale and I didn't like it at all. 

I'm agreeing with the suggestions put out there by everyone else. These are just my experiences. I'd say be like that first store!"

Well one day, we had to send a child home with a high fever (102+) and when the mother came to pick the kid up, she was livid about having to leave work early. Then when we explained to her that she had to keep her child at home until they were symptom-free, she absolutely blew her top. This was in the classroom, in front of a dozen other children. The other teachers in the room and I calmly asked her to take it to the office, which she did in force. I was told by the director that the mother came and yelled at the administrators for a good 15 minutes about how mad she was about missing work and how was she supposed to find alternate care under such short notice etc. Basically causing a huge scene.

All this while her 3 year old child was just hanging around, sweating and shivering and crying. I felt so bad for that poor kid."

Just try to focus on what you can be doing to improve your game. Positioning is probably the best thing you can work on. As a wing, you'll want to be covering the points in your zone and going up the sides when you're on offense. Be sure to keep your feet moving too, as the more often you're open, the more opportunities you'll get to play the puck.

Don't hesitate to ask your more experienced teammates for advice. Not only will their advice help you become a better player, but it'll help acclimate yourself to the team if you're getting involved and talking to your teammates.

The coolest thing was that in addition to fighting the fire, responders parked in front of the house and basically created a giant wall of water shielding the estate from any potential flare ups (later news reported that cinders flew as far as a 1/4 mile and caught another condo complex roof on fire).

A wise man once wrote: ""Regardless of what your opinion is, this is not the way to present it. It undermines everything you have to say."" 

&gt;""over 4 million smallholders have been able to increase yield per hectare, and reduce pesticide costs, time spent spraying dangerous pesticides, and illnesses due to pesticide poisoning.""

This same variety of cotton is seeing germination and pest problems in India, where (Mech 184) Bt cotton represents approximately 93% of all cotton. Bt cotton has the potential to revolutionize cotton production, but so far results have been mixed. 

&gt;""The data available so far provide no scientific evidence that the cultivation of the presently commercialized GM crops has caused environmental harm.""

I never claimed that GM crops have caused environmental harm. Why did you include this link in your response to my post? 

&gt;""Planting glyphosate-tolerant corn and soybean and using glyphosate in lieu of some residual herbicides (alachlor, atrazine, linuron, and metribuzin) should reduce the impact of the production of these crops on surface water quality.""

'Should'. I can think of no better word to describe potential, which is precisely what I described in my post. GMO technology has astounding potential. 

&gt;""Replacing these herbicides (atrazine and alachor) with glyphosate and glufosinate can reduce the occurrence of dissolved herbicide concentrations in runoff exceeding drinking water standards.""

From the abstract, emphasis mine: ""With the advent of transgenic, glyphosate-tolerant soybean and glufosinate-tolerant corn this concern **might** be reduced by replacing some of the residual herbicides with short half-life, strongly sorbed, contact herbicides."" 

The wonderful thing about scientific papers is that they very rarely jump the shark by using absolute language when the science isn't absolute. Once again, we have a paper discussing potential benefits. 

&gt;""Effects of glyphosate on contamination of soil, water, and air are minimal, compared to some of the herbicides that they replace. No risks have been found with food or feed safety or nutritional value in products from currently available GRCs. Glyphosate-resistant crops have promoted the adoption of reduced- or no-tillage agriculture in the USA and Argentina, providing a substantial environmental benefit.""

Same as the last two. 

You seem to have jumped in here thinking that I was 1) looking to argue against GMOs and 2) that I carry a stock set of positions on GMOs. These are both flatly wrong. I eat GM corn, GM soy, and use GM cotton products. I do support labeling, but not because I think GMO products are dangerous. I'm fairly sure that given time GM technology will deliver on the promise, but for the time being we're still in the infancy of the technology, and people like you who seem to be (""seem to be ""meaning this is how you appear to me, I could be wrong) treating GM technology like it's universally perfect are being more than a little unrealistic. GM is technology, not a religion. Celebrate GM successes, of which there are already many, but don't simply ignore problems because you think to admit it's imperfect makes you anti-GMO. It doesn't. Reality exists in shades of gray.

I've been lucky in that I haven't had to work with the bitey ones so much. I tend to see more hitting, shouting, or self-deprecation at the ages I primarily work with. 

What usually works in the case of biters is helping the child communicate their needs in a more appropriate way. We find that biters have a difficult time expressing themselves, since this behavior tends to manifest most in children who haven't developed their communicative skills. 

What we do is try to keep an eye on the child, and if we see them becoming frustrated or angry, we attempt to redirect them to a different activity. This is difficult and doesn't really get to the root of the problem though. In order to actually help the child communicate, we teach them basic signs to express themselves (did I mention we have a sign language program starting from infancy?) if they can't speak well, or teach them how to resolve issues using their words rather than their mouths. 

It's a long process, but it helps everyone involved."

Kingmilano,TaylorSwift,1390753556.0,"Loved the breakdown!  One thing though:

I think you're blurring the lines between song writer and producer.

All those songs you think classic Taylor are made by Nathan Chapman.  He's the one who originally started working with Taylor when she was 14 and started making demos.  He's basically the guy that creates all the different keyboard/drum/guitar/banjo/fiddle beats you hear when Taylor thinks of a melody and decides she wants to make it a song.  Here's her description of him after their first album.

""We switched [album] producers a bunch of times,"" Swift says. ""I started off with this demo producer who worked in a little shed behind this publishing company I was at. His name was Nathan Chapman. I'd always go in there and play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, and it sounded like a record. We did this for a period of a year to two years before I got my record deal.


_____

Red sounds so different because Taylor wanted (or was encouraged) to work with different producers on this album, which then led to new writers.  [Here's a really interesting article] (http://imgur.com/a/X6Xkk) that mentions the creation of Red (on page 2). 

A tl;dr is when Taylor was making Red with Nathan Chapman Scott Borchetta basically said nope I don't like this sound (I'm assuming to pull a wider audience and make more sales), and brought in Max Martin/Shellback.  This inspired Taylor to work with a bunch of different artists and producers and change the sound of Red to what it is now."

Wapook,BitcoinMarkets,1390753739.0,"The USD price is reflective of supply and demand specifically for bitcoins on MTGOX.

Supply of Bitcoins on Gox is low. Few people want to sell BTC on Gox for USD as they have low faith that the USD they get will be able to be withdrawn.

Demand of Bitcoins is very high on Gox because those who have USD on Gox can trade it for BTC and then transfer those and sell on another market.

For the most part the price difference between Gox and other markets (in USD) can be seen as an indicator of the faith buyers and sellers have in Gox's ability to withdraw USD. There's a bit more to it than that, and the price is confounded by other currencies that Gox trades in, and the pressure on sellers to hold their coins on Gox while the price is increasing."

ballookey,exjw,1390753829.0,"Jesus H Christ, that's an important link for people to read.

&gt; Malyon [a Society representative] presents a distorted picture of the WTS's position on JW children with respect to the blood issue. He states that a “child cannot be one of Jehovah's Witnesses” since JWs practise “mentally competent” baptism.

Bwah ha ha ha ha! OMG, what a heaping pile of BULLSHIT!

The Society's idea of ""mentally competent"" is a child who can correctly surmise the answers to three questions. 

I know this is harsh language, but the Watchtower Society practices statuary rape baptism: The kids think they want it, they know all the adults want them to do it, and they know the answers the adults want to hear. So the adults accept that and go ahead and baptize them

The problem is that NINE YEAR OLD'S don't have the mental capacity or life experience to make such a choice, regardless of their apparent willingness. It's encumbent on the adults in their lives to make BETTER choices on their behalf.

=

In Bulgaria, the Watchtower Society has reached an agreement with the government to NOT issue Advance Directive cards to minor children. HOWEVER, most Bulgarian JW's have no idea about this agreement since (of course), the Watchtower publications don't mention it, and when the topic comes up, they say that ""apostates lie"".

**That's disgusting!!!**

Those children have a right *not to die* because freakin' *Bulgaria* cares enough about children's welfare to protect them from the Society, but the JW's are told otherwise.

=

The Watchtower Society keeps trying to tell people there's no official or automatic sanction (or punishment, i.e. disfellowshipping) if someone accepts a blood transfusion. But at least the author of this (and the practical experience of every JW out there) knows otherwise:

&gt; Such tortured logic is analogous to stating there is no “sanction” for capital murder, since neither the verdict nor the sentence is arbitrarily applied or automatic!

=

Lastly, the interesting thing is that this article asserts that many JW's would accept blood, but that it's the Society's publications that characterize JW's as unanimous on this. 

In other words, a lot of JW's would get transfusions, but none of them know this about each other. How many who are conflicted on this would choose transfusions if they knew that their fellow brothers secretly agreed with that choice — if the Society didn't try to make anyone thinking such thoughts feel like a rogue outsider? 

Immensely interesting read, and gratifying to see someone who knows the bullshit the Society is up to — even if the author professes to be a JW themselves. (I honestly don't know why one would remain a JW if one knew that the very fundamentals of the belief are rotten, i.e. the Governing Body are not righteous, but perhaps ""Lee Elder"" needs more time to come to terms with her/his spiritual beliefs)"
rainbowplethora,AskMen,1390753830.0,"Anecdote: The other day I was at the pub with a bunch of friends after quiz night. The DJ was playing 50s and 60s music. There was this group of early-20s guys on the (tiny) dance floor. They were just getting down, for the fun of it. Some of them had decent moves and their friends were half mimicking them, half being silly. We had a great time watching them, and then getting up to dance with them. They didn't try to pick up any of my single friends, they were just there to enjoy themselves. That in itself was as impressive as their capable dancing. We were having a lot of fun, until a bunch of other guys noticed and came over to shuffle from foot to foot and hit on girls. Then the dancer guys just faded off into the night. "
Lost_in_Thought,casualiama,1390753832.0,"I answered a similar question above, but I'll add some more here. 

The facility I work at has been very progressive in hiring not just me, but at least 2 other men as well (only one of whom still works there) giving us probably the most employed men in a childcare center in the area. I have yet to encounter a parent who was apprehensive about leaving their child with me, unless I just didn't realize it - I'm not always good at reading adults. Any apprehension they might have is quickly washed away after they get to know me. I get quite a few parents coming up to me telling me how happy they are that I'm working with their child, how I'm a good role model and their children really look up to me.

Any new parents who might feel worried about it have their fears alleviated by word-of-mouth from other parents, and assurances from staff and directors that I'm a fantastic teacher. (ego+1)"
