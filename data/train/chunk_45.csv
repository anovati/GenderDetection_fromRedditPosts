When you look at your health on the top (or on the wii u gamepad), have you ever noticed a blade like thing thats glowing yellow? or overtime looks like it's broken? That there is your weapon's ""sharpness""

Certain monsters require a certain level of ""sharpness"" to be hurt and not have your blows bounce off of them. Since you're beginning the game, your weapon's sharpness should be yellow, that Bird you're fighting needs green sharpness and higher to get hurt effeciently by your weapon.

Overtime you can upgrade your weapon with resources you find throughout the game, one of the early quests explains this better I believe."
devilinmexico13,badhistory,1390958986.0,"&gt; You don't play things up and down to make people follow your opinion of righteousness. You tell them as best you can what happened.

I absolutely agree with you, with the caveat that this is only practical for a history major, not for the rank and file of society. Your original comment was:
&gt; No one seems to remember NVA and Vietcong atrocities anymore.

My point, in responding to that was that, for the typical person the atrocities committed by the NVA and Vietcong have no real impact on our lives, whereas those committed by our own troops help point out the failures of our policy in this regard. This is worth knowing for the typical American because it points out where we have failed to uphold the standards we claim to, and wish to, hold ourselves to. By knowing the ways in which we have failed in the past, it helps us to prevent those same failures in the future. 

From a historians standpoint, this is not necessarily the point of history, but your original comment was not strictly about historians. I highly doubt that there is a single historian out there who is unaware of the war crimes committed against US soldiers in Vietnam, and in fact I most people I know understand the breadth, if not the depth, of those crimes. The fact is, however, that this information is of little use to most people. The knowledge that we have done wrong, however, is of use to everyone, since it helps us guide society in such a manner as to help prevent these abuses from taking place again. "

Danyn,Nexus5,1390959005.0,"&gt; The case came 1 day earlier. I was really excited about it. It fits the phone just fine with the glass screen protector on it. Fit is perfect... function...
&gt; 
&gt; SUCKS
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried 4 AC adapters and 12 USB cables! 1 verified car usb charger that is 1.5A and 2.1A
&gt; 
&gt; With the phone on just sitting with the screen off, it doesn't give enough power to actually charge the phone while it's plugged into the USB cable. The battery power actually keeps slowly going down! I installed a battery mah chart. It is giving it power, but not even 500mah! It does say it's charging on AC power with all 12 of my USB cables including the one that iblason sent along with it.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a shame, because it's designed nicely (though the 2 halves would require duct tape or something as they are just held together by nothing more then friction. Nothing clips in or catches on anything. Unfortunately after I get done writing this here, I will be sending an email directly to iblason about a refund and a return. 500mah is not NEARLY enough for a Nexus 5 and this is only with the phone sitting, not running other apps, with the screen OFF! using the phone with the screen on, GPS, and a phone call?! This charger would be next to useless and actually worse then not having the case at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Crap product, because they took all the time to design this, and never bothered to care about how much juice the phone charges with. Dumb, just really dumb.
&gt; 
&gt; That's my review of this crap product, but at least it was shipped out in a timely manor directly from iblason.

That was one of the reviews for it."

For myself, I tend to go with a mix of incredibly smug, very self-deprecating and open conversations in ridiculous ways. Today, for example, Housemate and myself were at Aldi and had a girl laughing along with our conversation in no time: he was refusing to tell me where to get maple syrup ('I don't eat anything Canadian.') and I was expressing my outrage to the girl behind us, ('Can you believe that? maple syrup is practically one of your five a day; it comes from a tree. Mate, see this girl here - she appreciates maple syrup. She knows where it's at.'). After that we got the cashier into conversation by bickering again about whether it would be better to have one hundred spider sized tigers or one tiger sized spider out to kill you; she found it hilarious and was soon joining in the debate, alone with maple syrup girl from before. I wasn't being particularly flirtatious in these few minutes, but I think being at ease with strangers is pretty key in knowing how to flirt and knowing you can make girls laugh is a huge bonus. 

So yeah, be dorky, be confident (smirking and doing stuff like that works great for me in clubs) and show your personality.

Blindocide,DebateReligion,1390959340.0,"&gt;&gt; Saying there is a ""first moment"" is like saying there is a ""first point"" on the skin of a watermelon.

&gt;There *is* a first point on the skin of a watermelon. *At best* you can say the point is arbitrary. If the boundary of the universe is curved as Hawking argues in *A Brief History of Time*, then so be it. This does *not* allow us to escape the Kalam.

OK, but it does and here's why: you agree with the curved universe bit. Cool. So you look at one point on the curved spacetime loop and label it ""the first point"" and I look at a totally different point and arbitrarily label it ""the first point"". There is no way to objectively determine which point is first, and none of your ""previous point"" nonsense makes sense.

&gt;&gt;There is no ""first time"",

&gt;Of course there is. It is the point at which there is no previous moment in time.

Well, no there isn't because you're arbitrarily distinguishing which point is first. There is no objective ""first point"".

&gt;&gt;a footrace exists in a system of time outside of itself, the universe does not.

&gt;How is this a relevant objection? With both the race and the existence of the universe, we are considering finite (according to your own admission) spans of time. Tautologically, for every moment the race exists, it exists. However, that does *not* mean it did not begin. Chop off every moment in time previous to the start of the race and every moment afterwords. In that case, the race lasts the entire duration of the universe and it is *still* absurd to claim the race had no beginning.

Well if that span of spacetime was a curved universe into itself it wouldn't be absurd at all. But it's not so yeah, it's absurd.

&gt;&gt; Kalam's notion of time is obviously faulty.

&gt;This is not obvious. Furthermore, it is not obvious that there even is any significant difference between A- and B-time in any case.

This is when you betray the fact that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

&gt;&gt; Kalam didn't know about special relativity. 

&gt;""Kalam"" needs not know about special relativity and, for what it's worth, physicists may well not understand the philosophy of time well enough for their claim that there is a difference in A- and B-time and, furthermore, that B-time is the actual state-of-affairs of the universe.

Special  relativity tells us that there is no objective  privileged moment that we can call ""the present"". What we call ""the present"" is an arbitrary distinction we make out of  convenience.

Anyway, imagine the block universe like a rectangular prism of clay. We call one point the present and we cut the prism in half, and hell even take a one atom thin slice to represent the present. So we have the ""present"" slice, the ""past"" block, and the ""future"" block. Cool.

Now realize that you can't objectively label a slice of the clay ""the present"". So you can't cut the clay into ""past"" and ""future"" blocks in an objective way. Therefore, there is no objective thing called ""the present"", ""the past"" or ""the future"".

That's special relativity.

Boom, done.

And of course A theory says that there is ""the present"" and some weird metaphysical process in which the nonexistent future becomes the present, and is then either kept in an existing past (Growing Block Theory) or there is some other weird metaphysical process where the present is annihilated into the nonexistent past (Presentism)

Which is way different.

&gt;&gt;So, sure. Differ to a different Cosmological Argument, if you so choose. We'll tackle that one too.

&gt;You've not yet conquered the Kalam, so we can continue with that one.

Are you sure?

Edit: I think you missed the part where there's no objective way to distinguish between the ""beginning"" and the ""end"" of our universe. In fact, we don't even feel the ""movement"" of time in a direction. What we actually experience are states in which we can remember previous states.

This is because of how entropy, and therefore information content, of a system works. How your brain forms memories and what have you.

But this is just an error of our perception.

As Einstein has said: The distinction between the past, present and future is an illusory one. He said it for a reason. It's an arbitrary distinction made out of convenience for navigation.

Double Edit: actually, if your footrace analogy was it's own miniature little universe unto itself, there would be no way to objectively determine which point was the ""beginning"" and which point was the ""end"", as far as time is concerned. We can set arbitrary boundaries, I.e. when they racers are at the starting blocks, but that is arbitrary. Not objectively true. Arbitrary."

superspeck,HomeImprovement,1390959960.0,"I'm doing a fairly similar project, although I'm DIYing it and I'm using a bunch of reclaimed materials and some innovative sourcing for materials so that I could afford to do this project. I've thrown in guestimates for the costs there. 

Here's my **materials costs** (and one labor cost for the thing I can't do myself in a reasonable timeframe, which is tape and float drywall). The bathroom is a 6' x 10' master bathroom in a 1980 structure. 

* Demo - Free (Est - $250)
* City Permits - $90
* Windows - $750 ( 4' x 6' glass block, 2' x 3' single hung) 
* Framing/Sheathing and supplies - $150 
* Electrical, incl. new wire and fixtures - $400
* Insulation - $200 
* Drywall Materials - $150
* Drywall Labor - $250 
* Shower plumbing - Free (est. - $400 w/ labor) 
* New tub - Free (est. - $850)
* Toilet - Free (est. - $350)
* Vanity - Rebuilt/refinished old cabinets, shopped remnants for tops: $150 (est. - $1500 w/ labor)
* Tile - Oversized shower, backsplash, and floor: $400 (est. $3000 w/ labor) 

Included in my estimates are labor to do *exactly what I did* -- if you make different choices, I can't evaluate those. There's cheaper ways to do the vanity than to do what I did, but I did what was cheapest for me with the materials and expertise I had available. 

One wall of the bathroom (the one with the 4x6 window) had a bad case of termites and rotten wood. We removed that non-structural wall, replaced the framing and sheathing, and tied it back into existing systems.

I knocked down one of the walls when I was yanking out the old tub, so we just left that down, and rebuilt a pony wall to keep the vent stack for the plumbing hidden. That wall had the light switches in it though, so those moved to a different wall and required a junction in the attic. Part of the permit cost was a $35 electrical permit. 

My father-in-law is a master plumber, so he came out and helped me slip in a toilet flange to replace the broken one that was there and then gave me the toilet, sink, and tub mixer valve and trim. I had gotten a new fiberglass tub for free off of craigslist and had stored it for a few years until I was ready to do this project. I didn't need a new plumbing permit since I wasn't moving anything drastically; just be aware that plumbing can get really expensive really fast when you move things. 

I installed the tile myself, although I did have a couple of labor-only bids to try to keep me on track. (Since the materials have only been sitting in my garage for a month...) It was going to be expensive to lay the tile because of the layout of the bathroom. They could only have one or two guys working at a time, I wanted something specific, and 3""x6"" tiles are annoying, especially with trim. If you just go with 4""x4"" you might find someone to hang it for $1000 with the cost of tile included, but I wouldn't trust a price any lower than that. 

The cabinets on the vanity were really nice at one point. They have solid maple doors. They were made the last time that Oil Rubbed Bronze was in style, so I can re-use some of the hardware. I ended up carefully removing the faces of the box (which was built in place and couldn't be taken out without destroying them) and the doors, and moving all of it out into the garage. This weekend one of my many projects is to re-build new frames and boxes out there and start to re-finish the doors with some stain and polyurethane. 

The countertops are solid surface (e.g. Corian) material. I found a website online that sells remnants, and found a color and size that I could use given the odd size of the cabinets I was rebuilding. I needed a solid surface or granite because I was installing an undermount sink. Solid surface is best for me because it only requires carbide-tipped tools to work, which means that I can use my existing woodworking gear (routers, templates, saws, dual action sander, etc.) to finish it. 

So, I spent about $2500, plus or minus. 

For that amount, and every weekend of my life for four months, I got a roughly $11,000-$12,000 bathroom. The additional (as I only have $8500 in estimated costs above, all supplies except where noted) goes to cover the contractor's profit, the wages of common laborers (guys who install insulation and do light framing), and other specialities. I definitely didn't include the cost of an electrician for instance, and I did all of the 'design' work and legwork for inspections and permits myself. Cost of paint not included since I'm using up stuff I had sitting around. "

--------------------------------------------------------------------


From a young age, I always had a love for education.  I would create lesson plans and worksheets, forcing my younger brothers to sit down while I taught them Math and English. This passion was only intensified during my years in primary school.  From kindergarten to seventh grade I went to a Catholic parochial school that I adored.  I enjoyed learning every day, but it was not made easy for me. In a class of only around 25, I attended a school without friends.  I was teased and bullied constantly by my peers, and I made learning my solace. I was never seen without a novel in my hands, and I clung to my teachers‚Äô support and encouragement throughout primary school. Unfortunately, I grew up in a much less stable environment than all of my classmates; I had a military father who was deployed to Bosnia and Iraq, and at ten years old, when he returned, my family endured a terrible divorce.  These situations left my household much poorer than anyone else in our school, in which my parents struggled to keep my brothers and me enrolled. 


In eighth grade, after years of begging to transfer due to the pain my peers were inflicting, I finally entered public school.  After my first day I returned home and exclaimed, ‚ÄúI made friends!‚Äù with tears in my eyes.  I knew that I had found a school where I belonged. 
Finally feeling comfortable and happy with every part of my education, my mind flourished. I excelled in every subject, flew through whatever extracurriculars I could manage, and made more friends than I ever had in my life. I thought everything was perfect until I reached high school and found what I had not even known I had been missing. 

I signed up for Small Animal Care and Management I my first semester, a class that I hoped would cater to my lifelong love of animals. I never could have expected the impact that one class would have on my life. Through that course and the instructor who taught it, I uncovered a burning passion for agriculture. It became my every waking thought. I was a sponge to anything involving FFA, plant production, animal care, conservation, and beyond.  I joined my school‚Äôs FFA chapter, participated in speaking competitions, developed Supervised Agricultural Experiences, served as an officer, and very quickly decided that I never wanted to stop.  After growing up in a completely urban community, with no pets, no rural knowledge, no anything, agriculture was my calling. 


That did not mean it all came easy to me. It took years for me to learn concepts that my classmates grew up understanding and using. I killed every plant I touched while some of my friends were already running small businesses out of their backyards. They all accepted me despite these flaws but I realized that I had reached a point where I didn‚Äôt know where I belonged.  My childhood and life in a city held me back from developing my agricultural knowledge, but my passion had led me away from that place I knew, a place I did not relate to anymore. I had come to the point of no return. 


The choice I had to make became incredibly tangible with one piece of news.  My father and his wife had bought 27 rural acres and planned to farm it. My mother still lived in the middle of the city. After much debate, I made the decision to move out to the farm with my father, and that decision has changed the course of my life.  
After four years of living and working on a farm, building it from the ground up with my father, I have discovered a deep love and appreciation for agriculture. I developed a work ethic and pride in myself that I never had as a child, and I realized that working with nature is something I always want to do. Despite this, my passion for teaching also endured, which made my career choice quite obvious.  The impact that all of my Agriculture Educators have had on my life was exceptional, and I hope to affect my future students in a similar way. Every decision I have made since then, and everything I have learned has only intensified my ambitions and dreams. Although my past has not been the easiest, I cherish it and think about it often, because it is the reason that I am who I am today.

The_Big_ID,Terraria,1390960457.0,"Ranged never was an ideal class choice back in the pre-hardmode days, and due to the ammo-stack limit of 250, most people tended to ignore the class.

As I recall, there was 5 ['main'](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:PvP#Normal_Mode) armours that could be made (Hellstone, Meteor, Jungle, Necro, and Demonite/Crimtane), two of them more ideal for Melee, two for Magic, and just one for Ranged.

The weapon choice is slightly less limited compared to Mages though, as /u/thisisbleep stated. 

Melee has ~50 unique items pre-hardmode, some less useful than others.

Ranged gets a modest ~29 unique weapons (~23 without consumables), Including the immensely powerful Star Cannon, easily the most powerful pre-hardmode weapon.

Mages are limited to just 19 damaging magic weapons, so the lack of variation is mainly on that side.

Whilst you think ranged lacks a large variation in weapons for pre-hardmode, I feel it is actually rather balanced in terms of variety when compared to the other classes; Melee has Night's Edge, Mages have Flamelash/Flower of Fire, Ranged has Phoenix blaster/Minishark/Star Cannon.

And if you needed anything more powerful? Go Hardmode, it's relatively simple.

No. We arbitrarily labeled that.

Because they are exactly that: spatial references. We labeled a North and then worked with that.

Just like there is no objective beginning of the year but our calendars make sense.

And there's no objective ""now"" but we can still make temporal references. Because they are only references.

But there is no objective ""beginning of the universe"" because that's an arbitrary distinction we've made out of convenience in order to navigate the world and express temporal relationships between points on time.

POGtastic,AskReddit,1390960826.0,"A few things:

1. Everything in moderation. I have *absolutely no problem* with someone who smokes an occasional cigarette, gets wasted at a bar every once in a while, smokes the occasional bowl, and sometimes pigs out on a massive plate of fries. These things are a lot of fun, and doing them is not bad. But when you start smoking two packs a day, or a bowl three times a day, or drinking a 12-pack every night, or eating a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's every night, it's not a good thing.

2. Being healthy makes me feel good. Sure, there are times when I'm hurting while in the gym or not being able to eat the unhealthy things I want to eat. But when I look at myself in the mirror, I feel good about myself. It's important to me. I would feel a lot worse about myself if I ate whatever I wanted and wasn't healthy.

3. The human body is very resilient... in your twenties and thirties. When you get older, your body starts falling apart. I know a lot of people who partied really hard in their twenties, and they're miserable now because of medical issues. They can't do basic living, they're forced to take uncomfortable medications, they have a bad living situation due to medical bills. I'd rather avoid that.

I definitely become an insatiable black hole around shark week and theres no stopping me from roaming my kitchen and eating everything in sight. so if i stock up on carrot sticks,edamame, and pistachios it helps a lot. 

its seriously hard for me to even feel full during that time, I will have a full stomach but intense hunger pangs. I drink lots of watered down cranberry juice with lime and it kind of helps, but I usually end up standing over my kitchen island realizing how much progress I am compromising while I stuff my fifth quesadilla loaded with goodies into my mouth like a savage. 

I just make sure I do well during other times of the month and give myself a bit of leniency during shark week. I'm an emotional wreck that time and so im not too hard on myself, as I'm usually on track the rest of the time."

S-Flo,starbound,1390961582.0,"You're right, text is easier to handle in the context of web-development. You have to take a much different approach in the context of game development.

I'd say the difference is that you have to take many more variables into account when you're programming for a game, since all you really have at your disposal is an empty screen, some draw functions, and a few basic string-handling functions. With a game you have to specify exactly where and when certain things are going to be drawn onto the screen.

*Here's the general thought process behind a dialogue system I made as an example:*

&gt;Let's say you want to have an RPG-styled textbox system for dialogue. Let's assume that the text boxes are displayed above a character's head like in a comic book and that you want the text to be typed out letter-by-letter. Let's also assume that you know which font you're going to use and you have functions that can report back on characteristics of said font (like how many pixels wide a certain character is).

&gt;You'll have to take your string and calculate exactly how many pixels each character is going to take up in both the X and Y axis. Make sure you account for line breaks. Also, write code to handle line-breaks when drawing text to the screen if you don't already have a built-in function that does that for you.

&gt;Now that you have the X and Y dimensions of the text, use that information to figure out the dimensions of the box that the text is going to be displayed over.

&gt;Since that textbox is going to float above a character's head, make sure and calculate where that should be relative to the character. Check to make sure it's completely within the player's view and move it over to the closest corner of the screen if it's not (like if the character speaking is close to the top of the screen).

&gt;Draw a little sprite on the top or bottom of the box to make the ""tail"" of the text bubble.

&gt;Make a second, empty, string that represents the typed-out text that's being drawn to the bubble. Every few milliseconds add one character from the original string of text to the actual string that's being drawn. If the player is pressing a certain button, decrease the number of milliseconds between adding characters.

&gt;Once the text is fully displayed, draw an arrow in the corner of the textbox to prompt the player to continue. Once the player presses a certain button, remove the textbox.

If you wanted it to look even better, you could try animating the textbox's appearance with an easing function or something. That involves creating a few timing flags and some other stuff I don't feel like getting into though.

Now let's say you want to use scrolling text instead. Well, that's not part of the existing code, so you're going to have to figure out yourself exactly how to do that then work it into the system. 

Does that help give you an idea of what making game GUIs is like?"

IT doesn't consider rape to be the worst possible crime or the conviction rate would be higher. The very fact that women are warned so much about stranger rape when they are more likely to be raped by someone they know is problematic. It teaches them to be suspicious of the wrong people.  
People steal because there is financial gain. Murder happens because someone comes out beneficial and the victim doesn't have to suffer. Again, don't compare them to rape.  
And again, the conviction rate for rape is so low and the legal stance on rape so vague that many victims (that both men and women) feel that the police won't take them seriously.

typer525,hearthstone,1390962196.0,"Are you talking about getting an alarm-o-bot and a big creature in your hand by turn 3 with this deck? I'll give it a try.

First off, there are 12 big creatures, and 2 alarm-o-bots. By turn 3, you will have drawn 3 cards on top of your 3 or 4 starting cards from your deck for a total of 6 or 7 cards.

If you are going first, there are Binomial(30, 6) = 593,775 ways of drawing 6 cards from a 30 card deck. The number of combination of 6 cards that have 1+ alarm-o-bot and 1+ big creature is 206,479 for a probability of 2269/6525 ~= 34.77%.

If you are going second, you have 7 cards or Binomial(30, 7) = 2,035,800 possible starting hands. Again, fast fowarding through the combination calculations, there are 831,376 hands with 1+ alarm-o-bot and 1+big creature. That comes out to 7994/19575 ~= 40.84% chance of having that such a hand. 

***NOTE*** This is just the chance of having these cards in your hand. Calculating the chance of getting a big minion on the field on turn 4 after playing the alarm-o-bot on turn 3 is much harder to calculate."

Banner_Free,AskWomen,1390962433.0,"I'm not /u/asexist-throwaway, but the difference I've usually observed in what people mean when they say ""job"" versus ""career"" is: A career has a future with progression and security.

My previous girlfriend, for example, worked for a fast food place. (And to clarify: I absolutely don't mean this as a slight against her. It's just what she did for a living.) When you think about cooking fried chicken or serving donuts for a living, you don't really think about where you'll be ten years from now. It pays the bills today and that's where you start and stop caring about it. That's a job.

On the other hand, I'm a software engineer. (Again: Not to say this makes me a better or worse person. It's just the path I've chosen.) So, I'm constantly aware not just of what I'm doing today, but of where it's setting me up to be five or ten or twenty years from now. For example, last year I left the best-paying job I ever had because a) it was in a niche of the industry that's dying out, and b) it wasn't letting me progress from being an individual contributor toward leading a small team.

On the other-other hand, at some point, my fiancee and I have talked about wanting to (finances permitting) have a stay-at-home parent when we have kids. That would most likely be me. At that point, if I were to keep doing work, I would switch to taking contract jobs that I could do remotely.  (""Here's $5000, and we expect you to deliver us a working server in a month"" kind of stuff.) That would be putting my career on hold in favor of family concerns, but still having a job.

Pretty much the most consistent concern raised about my animations is the fast text speed. This is why.

[](/sp)
[](/twismile) It's an ongoing adventure to hit the right balance. I try to divide the weighting between 'how long it takes to read it,' 'how long it takes to *say* it,' 'how much information there is to process,' and 'what I want the pacing to be like right here.' As an example, Fluttershy's ""I... so, this says I win, now? I think?"" was up longer than any other line (I think) not because it's a lot to read, but because it's got all these pauses that stretch it out in speech, and because I wanted to allot some time to process 'She just won,' and hopefully give the actual Yu-Gi-Oh! players to figure out for themselves what she just did, before Rainbow says it.

[](/ppcute) This is all inconsequential minutiae, of course. My Rainbow Falls deleted scene did very well and its text speed was *terrible*, relatively speaking. I just want these to be the highest-quality they can be within this little medium."

Similar on the low side. That does assume the same length would be extruded for a given extrusion command when the filament diameter varies, which is not the case, but it's probably a smaller effect.

Banner_Free,AskWomen,1390963498.0,"Friendly bit of advice: Try to put yourself into a woman's position and really think about how she'd feel about the things you do or say. (I used to be really bad at this. I've slowly and painfully gotten better over the years.)

To take your example of painting exes in a bad light: She might wonder, ""Is he going to talk about me like this if/when we break up? Three months from now, am I going to be 'that crazy bitch?'""

So, if you really do feel compelled to say something about your ex - which is okay if it's part of the natural flow of a conversation - don't talk about her like she's ""that crazy bitch.""

I sometimes have reason to talk with my fiancee about issues I've had with my exes. Every time, I make sure to explain the *full* situation, including my own role in the issue, where I thought they might be coming from, why I thought all parties involved acted the way they did, how I thought they might've handled it better, how I thought I might've handled it better, how I've handled similar situations since then ... And never just frame it in terms of ""that crazy bitch screwed me.""

It sounds cumbersome at first, I realize. Once you get the hang of it, though, the conversation can flow naturally, and you can show that you're capable of nuanced thought from multiple perspectives - which is, from what I've observed, a pretty major green flag :)"

It sounds like you're trapped in the mindset of separating your personal self from ""the boss"" you're supposed to be.  You don't have to keep your personal life OUT of the office, you just have to include and express it at appropriate times and in appropriate ways.  You don't need to maintain authority, you HAVE authority.  It isn't a facade that you're putting on.  How you handle the challenging issues is what will really establish your credibility with the people you work with.  Being defensive about your authority will undermine it, so you have to be cautious with how you approach these issues.

Personally I'd just roll with the Mommy nickname, it will get harder and harder to avoid comments as you get farther along, and I think you're right that trying to squash it will be off-putting to your staff.  It's ok to let them establish personal connections with you as long as you keep it office appropriate and stay professional.  That said, if you really aren't comfortable about it you ask him to stop.  Say it with a smile, don't make it a big deal, suggest that it is getting old, or that if he keeps it up you're going to start giving him extra ""chores"", or something else light.  If he continues, then you take the more serious approach of ""I appreciate the thought but I would prefer if you did not call me that from now on.""  Still with a smile, still with an informal setting.  If he continues to disregard your wishes you escalate through appropriate channels.  More formal talk to highlight that you are serious in your request and would prefer not to have to repeat yourself in future.  Then you escalate through superiors and HR because at that point it becomes insubordinate for him to continue.  Failure to follow through WILL undermine your authority, so choose one path or the other and stick with it.

It's not a bad thing to be human as a boss.  Unless you are the kind of boss that expects your staff to be inhuman.  It is a balancing act and it gets easier with practice, it is just another skill.  As women in professional settings we tend to try to be more masculine, that's the stereotypical authority figure and that's often the pressure put on us by others.  This leads to being more impersonal, less approachable, and there are pros and cons to that.  That isn't the only way to be the boss, and it isn't necessarily the best way.  You are fair and professional, you've established yourself as competent.  Live in that space.  Be yourself in it.  And let your staff get comfortable too because the last thing you want is to finally break and meltdown in the office.  I know better than anyone that it isn't easy.  I'm not suggesting you let your inner goddess out at work.  But building and allowing your staff to build a personal rapport will help you be a more effective manager in the long run and it will help you manage your current circumstances more easily.

If your school is new, that means that your instructors, advisors, and administrators are all new, too. I.e., they moved from other institutions fairly recently and are likely to still have decent connections. Why not talk to them about your interest in research and ask if they can help you connect with their colleagues from other universities? If you can get them to forward your resume and cover letter to potential PIs with a little blurb like ""so-and-so is a student of mine looking for such-and-such types of opportunities"", you'll have a pretty decent chance of getting a response from at least a few of them.

Maybe I'll bump into them (and it's always by mistake, I don't do this on purpose), and start a conversation after apologizing.  They won't ever mind if they are interested.  Maybe I'll even blame them and squeeze a drink out of them.

At least it was for me. 

It took a while but I had to replace the horrible images with good ones. Whenever I pictured her falling into the water I forced myself to think of her doing other adorable things instead.

vehementvelociraptor,AskReddit,1390964920.0,"I appreciate you sharing them with me.  And you know what, your sentiments are in the right places, and I'm glad there are people like you out there.

I'd like to address a few of your points, to give you an idea of why we, gun owners/enthusiasts, think like we do.

&gt; I honestly feel that their is no need for civilians to carry firearms

In a perfect world, i would agree with you.  Even in an imperfect world, the complete lack of firearms would make a better place.

&gt; Why is an amendment that was put in several hundred years ago, still being practiced?

You know, you're right.  Things change, and the laws should reflect the times.  However, you have to realize where this amendment came from.  It was to defend ourselves against the british.  Are there any brits around that are a threat?  No, of course not.  Is the US likely to revolt against it's government?  No, not really.  **BUT** if you take away our firearms you take away our only chance of revolt.  It's more symbolic than anything.  Our right to arms is symbolic of our right to stand up for ourselves, and take our lives in our own hands for what we believe in, to defend what we feel is just.  Trust me, I have no desire in this lifetime or a thousand lifetimes to take another person's life.  My right to bear arms symbolizes my right to stand up to something bigger than myself.

It's a little bit of a rant, I know, filled with rhetoric.  The fact is that now more than ever, the US government has shown a complete lack of interest in it's citizens.  I don't think it'll ever get to that point where I feel like I'd have to stand up against my government, but taking away that possibility is the biggest ""fuck your rights"" that my gov't can throw at me.

&gt; But if you take away our guns criminals will still get them via the black market and we can't defend ourselves.

I don't know how to defend this statement.  It's true.  You have no idea how *easy* it is to get a firearm illegally here.  It's a joke.  Frankly it would be less time consuming for me to take a 5 minute drive to the west side of town, ask a few questions, and walk away with a fully loaded handgun with the serial# scratched off.  COmpare that to going to a store, waiting period, background check, etc.

Now of course I'm not gonna do that.  But if you ban firearms for legal purchase, the only people that are going to be able to obtain them are the ones that have no problem shooting me.  I'm having a hard time expressing myself here, but it's a lot like, ""Okay, so I'm not going to break the law and get a firearm, but Joe here who wants to kill me can still get one easily.""  It is so UNFAIR.  The law should protect it's citizens, not put them at a disadvantage.  That;s what that sentiment means.

&gt; Although I've preached, if I were to reach common ground and say the public can have small low caliber hand guns as self defence, I could almost live with it. But what I was shocked to see from my travels in the US was, a) high powered sniper rifles, super rpm automatic weapons

You might be hugely surprised here.  The guns that youre okay with, handguns and small caliber weapons, account for the **VAST** majority of gun violence here in the states.  High powered rifles, automatic weapons, large caliber 'assault weapons', COMBINED count for less fatalities that knives do.  Here's [proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ushomicidesbyweapon.svg).  It's staggering.

Also to take note, fully automatic weapons here are nearly impossible to obtain.  They cost $30,000+ and you have to go through a background check so thorough, a speeding ticket might bump you out.  I'm dead serious.  The ignorance surrounding how 'easy' it is to gain a machine gun here is stupid.  Flat out stupid.  It creates fear where it's not even justifiable.

&gt; Wal-Marts gun section... Food, clothes, kids toys, guns... Almost seems to desensitize the seriousness of them

Here I agree with you completely.  It sickens me how casual guns here are in the states.  Hell, my career is designing the damn things and I agree with your point.  Guns have the capacity to cause incredible damage, and they should be respected as such.

So listen man, I don't think I've swung you to the pro-gun side, and that wasn't my intent.  But hopefully you have gained an insight into our thought processes.  If you still disagree with me, that's awesome and I'm glad that you can stand up for what you want.  But now I think you have a better idea on how to frame your opinions, with regard to ours."

I expect people to have as healthy a relationship as possible with their family. My fiancee, for example, does not associate with her mother. There are very good reasons for this, though, so I don't think anything less of her for it. (If anything, I'm impressed by how well she handles the situation.)

Her father, on the other hand, is a great guy, and they have a great relationship. If they did not have a good relationship, that would be a red flag for me.

cluberti,sysadmin,1390965495.0,"If the boxes are running Windows, and the servers have TPM chips in them, bitlocker would be the first thing I'd look into if the organization didn't already have an encryption standard.  You'd have to determine the best way to escrow keys in the event of a failure, but recovery prompts should not happen randomly if you leave the defaults for PCR's used (Bitlocker should only prompt for a recovery key if the PCR measurements at encryption time don't match the reported PCR values at boot - this is not a random occurrence, and indicates something is inherently wrong - hence the recovery prompt).

In my experience over the years, people generally run into problems when they aren't storing keys properly (if you don't want to store them in AD, consider MBAM istead - if you have an SCCM infrastructure, MBAM can plug in there as well), or modify the defaults without good reason.  You'll have to decide if you want to force the use of a PIN at boot or not (forcing a pre-boot PIN would require physical or iLO access at boot to enter it and continue booting, just like on a workstation), of course, but that's security vs convenience at that point - if the server is physically taken, and not just the drives, encryption does you no good as the keys to unlock are on the motherboard and without PIN requirements, having the server means having the data.  However, even with no PIN unlock requirement, stealing a drive or drives without the whole server means having to provide the recovery key for access (this is also true if the drives are attempted to be accessed offline, regardless of whether or not a PIN is used - offline access == recovery key required, no matter what).

Vendor BIOS issues can cause problems with PCR register reporting as well, but there are ways to figure out if that's happening (especially with Windows Server 2012/2012R2) and fix or avoid the issue.  Bitlocker isn't scary or unreliable if it's done properly, just like almost every other IT technology out there."

temp9876,BabyBumps,1390965510.0,"That's pretty funny actually, because we had a similar situation!  Scarlet fever is still surprisingly common, we just don't call it that anymore!  It's just strep throat, when left untreated (which may happen if they aren't symptomatic) it can develop into all sorts of fun things like Scarlet Fever or a pretty funky flesh eating rash.  

My youngest will get strep throat and be completely fine, no symptoms.  The first time we learned this it was because he had the funky flesh eating rash (necrotizing fasciitis), which was funky enough to get treated FAST, didn't even wait for the culture to come back.  Course of antibiotics and a cream for the mean time, right as rain, good as new.  He's had scarlet fever too, it's really just strep throat plus a rash and since it is treated the same as normal strep you'll rarely even hear it called by name anymore.

Now whenever anyone else in the family gets strep we have to take the whole family in to be tested and treated at the same time as a precaution.  I have had a few arguments in doctors offices about it before they pull my little guy's chart and see that he is prone to be asymptomatic when he gets strep and develop complications.

I actually have pretty decent luck wit Dr. Google, I think it is a useful resource when you have specific acute symptoms, it's just the more general stuff that gives you open ended answers.  Of course, after 12 years I'm pretty pro at kid first-aid so I usually have a good idea where I'm looking and what I'm looking for before I check Dr. Google, I'm just deciding whether to continue treating at home or if there is a point to braving the walk-in clinic.

Your views are intriguing.  I completely agree that buying a gun for the feeling of being well protected is bullshit.  Anyone can buy a gun, but it takes a lot of knowledge to defend yourself with one correctly.

I believe you when you give that statistic: 

&gt; The odds of having something bad happen to you in your home if you own a gun only increase.

But I'd like to know if you can point me to the source if you have it?  Interesting reading.

However, I'd like to point out to you that there are people out there who are utterly capable of defending themselves with a firearm.  I'm one of them.  That statistic is not applicable to me, as I have put tens of thousands of rounds downrange, completed self-defense courses, and compete in IDPA (international defensive pistol association).  It's not a humblebrag, it's just so you know that there are exceptions to that blurb.

Putting a few rounds in a paper target from 5 yards away, in daylight, in perfect conditions is utterly useless in a self defense situation.  Unfortunately, most people who buy firearms for self-defense are ignorant of that fact.  And I'm scared of them, and for them.  I wish there was better resources out there to keep more people safe."

rohrspatz,medicalschool,1390966288.0,"First of all, are you getting any kind of treatment for your depression? If you're still having symptoms as serious as suicidal ideation, whatever you're doing right now may not be enough.

Having an untreated or under-treated chronic illness both adds to the amount of stress that gets piled onto you *and* decreases your ability to deal with stress - in other words, it's making things way, way harder than they need to be. I would seriously advise you to work on getting your symptoms under control before you decide that you aren't able to cope with med school stress. It seems like what you're unable to cope with currently is actually the sum of med school stress AND the stress of chronic depression, which honestly is completely understandable.

In the meantime, though, I'll share with you my most valuable, ""high-yield"", top-secret source of stress relief: Having a hobby that provides me with a social life outside of med school. (Salsa dancing!) It isn't exactly a lot, but at least 2-3 times a month I'm able to be in a 100% non-med-school environment with fun, interesting people who just want to have a good time and enjoy each other's company.

I am a mormon agnostic atheist. COLDS lost me three years ago. I really don't see where I've ""taken it out"" on anyone in this thread.

&gt;Sex is not bad, and the LDS church has always taught this.

followed by

&gt;anything outside of [marriage] damages individuals, families, and society

Besides your two statements disagreeing, we are once again left with pseudoscientific bullshit. Regarding ""sex is not bad"":

&gt;‚ÄúThe First Presidency has interpreted oral sex as constituting an unnatural, impure, or unholy practice. If a person is engaged in a practice which troubles him enough to ask about it, he should discontinue it.‚Äù

From Spencer Kimball:

&gt;""Sex is for procreation and expression of love. It is the destiny of men and women to join together to make eternal family units. In the context of lawful marriage, the intimacy of sexual relations is right and divinely approved. There is nothing unholy or degrading about sexuality in itself, for by that means men and women join in a process of creation and in an expression of love.

&gt;The union of the sexes, husband and wife (and only husband and wife), was for the principal purpose of bringing children into the world. Sex experiences were never intended by the Lord to be a mere plaything or merely to satisfy passions and lusts. We know of no directive from the Lord that proper sex experience between husbands and wives need be limited totally to the procreation effort, but we find much evidence from Adam until now that no provision was ever made by the Lord for indiscriminate sex.

From J. Rueben Clark:

&gt;Remember the prime purpose of sex desire is to beget children. Sex gratification must be had at that hazard.

So, from this we have

* Oral sex is bad (this statement has never been retracted, by the way. Hope you and your wife don't do oral).

* Children are the primary purpose for sex. It's not recommended to have sex for ""fun.""

Oh, and somehow masturbation can lead to homosexuality. I can't help but wonder why the vast majority of men are not homosexuals, then.

And, finally, according to COLDS, it would be better to **die** than to be raped. It would be better for your *child to be murdered* than for them to have pre-marital sex. Are you fucking kidding me.

But ""sex is not bad?"" Please. Again, we have COLDS inventing the disease, and selling the cure. Taking the good away from humanity and selling it back at a cost.

Finally, I can't help but wonder what you think about 50 or 60 year old men asking 12 year old girls and boys if they masturbate."

You have diabetes--you can't live on Ramen for the week. Your husband is asking that you compromise your health for his pride. That's not how adults express their love. My husband would march into a food pantry with a brass band if we didn't have food to eat for a week. I'd do the same for him if I had to. Pride is nothing when the health and well-being of my partner are at stake. 

What I don't understand is what the fuck is he spending your household money on that he can't reserve enough for food for the month without dipping into a ""secret food fund""? And why aren't you planning and prepping appropriate meals for the month? You *know* that it's a long month and that you don't have a lot of money to spare, why aren't either or both of you planning for this? We just bought a house, then Christmas with his family and then we hit a deer on the way home from a wedding party last weekend so money is also a bit tight for us until the 31st. I made 3 batches of ham and lentil soup for a total of $20. I made one and had enough veggies and lentils to make 2 more so I prepped them and stuck them in the freezer. Each batch fed (or will feed, the 3rd batch is being made tomorrow) both of us for 3 meals. Yes, it sucked to eat the same thing so much this month but it's better than chef boy or ramen. Taco soup was a little bit more expensive but still cheap and easy. A bag of 9 chicken breasts is about $14--they aren't great but it's good protein--one of those with some BBQ sauce and sweet potatos cut into fries and baked is super cheap. It's not hard to eat cheaply and healthily, it just takes a tiny bit of forethought and planning. You have diabetes, meal planning should be a priority for you. 

Yes, be mad at him for being a dick but be mad at the both of you for your total lack of planning. I know it's easy to think ""well, we're broke and all the budgeting in the world won't fix that"" but that is a fallacy. You can budget at least to make it through the month in one piece. "

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390966861.0,"&gt;and that they are not the ones with the enormous archive of video.

From what I can tell actually they are.  The link from warlocktx on ars actually goes directly to the company that lists the daily show as one of their clients.  

I even said in my last line that I wouldn't be surprised if it was the production company or viacom that actually owned the equipment, or if they just paid fee to a hosting company that does it.  

But it seems like the advertised snapstream  solution (http://www.snapstream.com/enterprise/markets/televisionAndFilmProduction.asp) is actually intended to be locally hosted and run on your own network.  So that would tend to mean the daily show would need to  have their own on site racks.  

&gt;As for where the metadata comes from, subtitles are almost always transcribed by human beings (for unscripted shows) or taken from the original script.

Right, but it's actually embedded as text in the data cable stream, so when you actually get the cable you can grab the text.  

For the daily show to get the data they can rely on what comes down the cable system.

&gt;Wasn't it just last year that ABC or some other network got all kinds of ribbing for a computer subtitling program that was completely wrong?

That was for setting the language wrong.  But yes, the BBC and Dancing with the stars have had some fairly serious  issues with live broadcasts.  

Speech to text usually works reasonably well, but yes, you tend to want to have an actual human being going over it (preferably one with the script in hand) for words that it can't understand.  An off the shelf real time speech system is probably 85% accurate on a person speaking into a dedicated microphone (that would be something like dragon naturally speaking), but a real time broadcast with background noise etc. and the whole thing is much much harder, and then stenographers fail pretty much equally badly if not moreso.

&gt; Anything with more than 5 bullets to a mag and basically anything that isn't the 2 aforementioned guns is for killing people

It's true.  Admitted.  I can't even think of a half-assed fact to dispute you.  But I mean, I own multiple firearms that carry more than 5 rounds.  Pistols, rifles, 10 rds, 15 rds, 30, 40, 50, etc.  I have em.  Have I killed anyone?  Nope.

It's not a great defense, but it's an important one.  Just because there exists a tool out there for killing people, doesn't mean that it will be used for that express purpose.  I like shooting for sport and competition.

I'd also like to posit you with this situation.  The fastest anyone can go legally in a car (at least in the US) is ~80mph, or 129 kph.  A Toyota Camry with a 120hp engine can achieve this easily.  So why are people allowed to buy sports cars with 600horsepower engines?  You'll never legally be allowed to use that power, and you should never put yourself in a situation where you need it anyways, and besides it is EXTREMELY dangerous to people's lives if they use it.  Did you know that in 2010 ***THREE TIMES*** as many people died in car crashes than were killed with a gun.  (US only).  Another shitty analogy, but it's pretty much the same.

Now, I want to ask you to seriously defend your following claim:

&gt; But any modern firearm should be outlawed from ownership

This is a good sentiment.  In your ideal world, this 'law' would be effective immediately and modern firearms would disappear.  Please tell me how this is at all feasible.

Meth and heroin are outlawed from ownership, but they still get into ***FEDERAL PRISONS***.  Please explain to me how your 'law' would have a different effect, and actually work.

Listen, I'm not trying to insult you, I;m trying to make you understand that while your sentiments and intentions are good, there is literally no way to enfore what you want.

Believe me, if there was a way to take away all the guns ever, and the technology to create them, I would support it.  The fact is though that you can't.  There are too many out there.  The only people that would be able to obtain a gun under your 'law' are exactly the ones that would have no problem murdering you.

That kind of law should protect law abiding people, not put them at a severe disadvantage.  Hopefully you can see that I agree with you, but also disagree with you.  This is why people like me disregard your sentiments so readily.  It's because that they might be good hearted and pure in nature, but they're feasibly unobtainable, and hurt the people they're supposed to protect.

Five or six mana should be all you need and then you'll be pitching extras to protect your Sphinx. AEtherling needs 8+ with a lot of blue sources. Cyclonic Rift is not usually fitting for this kind of deck. You probably need to deal with things permanently and not lose a card just to bounce stuff, even if overloading it could be awesome. Far // Away isn't bad, but I found it too clumsy to maindeck and pushed it off to the side to deal with Blood Barons.

Most decks like this are running some number of Reaper of the Wilds, Polukranos, and Desecration Demon. They each have their benefits, but they are big 4-mana bodies you can sometimes play turn 3 and they all end the game pretty quickly if unanswered.

To answer your other question counters aren't really for this style of deck. Counterspells are best when you're able to use the mana in other ways if your opponent decides to not cast things into the counters. You'd rather be proactively progressing your board or stymieing theirs than trying to hold up reactive mana."

They've already written off the game, and even if they end up playing it and secretly enjoying it enough to keep playing they will focus on the negative.

I think there are two main reasons why they behave this way:

1. They feel betrayed. They had a very specific vision for what an online Elder Scrolls game should be and they didn't get it. Now they want to spread their anger and hopefully make others see the game the way they do.

2. Trolls. No community is immune to trolls. They just get pleasure from insulting something someone else likes and the though of making someone mad. Nothing new here."

Willravel,DaystromInstitute,1390967543.0,"The death toll in San Francisco stands at 61,045. In the aftermath of the U.S.S. Vengeance crashing into Earth's capital, Starfleet has lost the trust of the Federation entirely. While the President, with authority from the Federation Council, has ordered a whole series of investigations, the entire Federation is verging on upheaval. Several planets are talking about session. At the center of the controversy lies the young crew of the flagship, the Enterprise. 

Grounded, once again, the crew have to endure the consequences of having been so easily manipulated by the ridiculous plans of a mad admiral. Hearing after hearing see the crew, one at a time, answering questions for different levels of civilian and Starfleet authorities. The situation is exacerbated when the Starfleet hearings have an air of respect and acceptance of what Kirk did, while the civilian hearings are highly critical of some of the decisions he made. 

Elsewhere, the Klingon Empire, both enraged by human feet violating Kling soil, and smelling Federation blood in the water, is in the final stages of full invasion. After discovering the Narada in space years prior, and losing a number of ships in taking it, the Empire went into paranoid panic mode and began manufacturing ships faster than they could even be manned. The High Council introduced an incentive system for having large families, rewarding those who had many sons and daughters with positions of honor and prestige in the Empire. In the 25 years since the discovery of the Narada, the Klingon population had seen an unprecedented boom. Prior to the Marcus Incident, the Klingons had their sights primarily on the Romulan Empire, which, in response to learning of Klingon might, were preparing a mass exodus. After the deaths of so many Klingons at the hands of so few, and the very public reveal of a massive Federation warship, though, their gaze moved to Earth. 

Not understudying the subtleties to Federation's civilian rule over Starfleet meaning that Starfleet was in danger of being radically reorganized and being out of commission for a few years, the Klingons move swiftly and without mercy. 40 systems are lost in the first 12 hours, and Starfleet was still in the process of attempting to rebuild ships lost in the Battle of Vulcan. The Federation was, quite simply, no match for the Klingons. The Federation Council signaled surrender at the 24 hour mark, but the Klingons ignored it. They attempted to reach out to other regional powers for assistance, insisting that Klingon domination of the Federation means Klingon domination of the quadrant, meaning they, too, would be subjugated, becoming interstellar Hellots. The Cardassians, Ferengi, First Federation, and Patriarchy all refuse. The Romulans use the opportunity to leave the quadrant, abandoning Romulus and their various satellite worlds. 

Kirk's ordered back to the Enterprise with his crew, and are ordered to stall the Klingons so as to allow the Federation to similarly abandon their worlds, to attempt to run from the Klingons. Kirk orders Scotty to rig the prototype transwarp beaming system on the Enterprise in order to weaponize transporter technology. The Enterprise creates a massive sensor and data network with other Starfleet vessels and outposts in order to monitor the Klingon advance with as much accuracy as possible, and then cranks the Enterprise core to full power, channeling it into the transporters, so they can beam torpedoes all over the quadrant. Hundreds of Klingon vessels are destroyed, but in the end, Spock comes to the conclusion that Starfleet lacks the munitions for the effort to succeed, or even really slow the invasion. Kirk contemplates using the remaining munitions to deal a devastating blow to Qo'noS, essentially enacting a last resort scorched-Earth strategy by striking at the heart of the Klingon Empire. He, Spock, and Bones discuss the moral question of whether the lives of everyone on Qo'noS, including innocent civilians, are worth saving the Federation, if it would even work. 

Kirk, desperate, exhausted, on the verge of breaking, orders the destruction of Qo'noS, just as Spock Prime beams to the bridge of the Enterprise using the same transwarp beaming technology. 

""Jim, there's another way. A better way."" Quoting Captain Archer, he says they can set right what once went wrong: they can save the quadrant by completing Spock's original mission. 

Unbeknownst to basically everyone, Spock had brought together some of the greatest scientific minds left of the Vulcan people, ostensibly to rebuild Vulcan society, but actually to set about figuring out how to undo the greatest mistake Spock ever made, in failing to stop the Hobus Supernova and being sucked back in time with the Narada. After years of study, Spock and his scientific team had discovered that Red Matter does not actually create an artificial singularity, rather it opens a highly unstable wormhole which is connected to a different layer of subspace: the layer of subspace which holds the source of gravity's force. 

Unfortunately, because all of the Red Matter in existence was used, the only way to access the gravimetric wormholes is at a previous location, so the Enterprise sets course for the Vulcan system at maximum warp. Upon arrival, the bridge is silent in the face of the devastation. Because Vulcan disappeared in a massive, sudden source of extreme gravity, the entire system was thrown into chaos. Several of the gas giants collided in the next year, throwing gasses and debris all over the system. The systems' two asteroid belts had also become unstable. The system appeared an apocalyptic nightmare. Spock prime puts his hand on NuSpock's shoulder, in an uncommon showing of emotion. 

The point in space where Vulcan was pulled into a gravimetric wormhole is being dragged along by the Vulcan sun, so the Enterprise crew is able to locate it. Spock, working with Scotty and Sulu, is able to make a best guess about how to navigate gravitational subspace in order to link back up with the original gravimetric wormhole and get back to the unaffected universe just before the Squid and Narada arrived at the Hobus Supernova. 

Sulu's face is unmoving and stoic, light sweat on his forehead, as he navigates mad swirls of black, red, and orange, as they move through the hellish wormhole. Spock's program has sensors mapping out shifts and intersecting wormhole tunnels, so the Enterprise can stay on course. Despite this, there is a sudden shift and the Enterprise is thrown back into normal space. 

Kirk: ""Date and location, Mr. Chekov."" 

A few buttons. Calculations, verifications. ""Approximately 1.5 light years from Vulcan... stardate 45349.1. It's 2368, sir."" 

The Enterprise heads to the closest inhabited system, Penthara, and finds the Enterprise D in the process of reversing the damage done by a type-c asteroid. Spock theorizes that the only reason they could have come out in this location and time is because it was caught in the route of another ship traversing the gravitational subspace. 

Kirk hails the Enterprise D..."

FreyjaSunshine,medicine,1390968375.0,"Sedation --&gt; general anesthesia is a continuum.  Many ""deep sedation"" cases are actually general anesthetics. If your protective airway reflexes are obtunded, then it's a general, and there's really no way to know that unless something gets down to your larynx and you either cough or you don't.

If you are having ""deep sedation"" (which could very well be a general anesthetic) then you should be monitored by someone who is not involved in the procedure, and is capable of resuscitation.  You should have the standard monitors (pulse ox, EKG, blood pressure and end-tidal CO2) throughout the procedure. There should also be staff trained in ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) and a crash cart with a defibrillator on site. I'd ask about that. 

Deep sedation can be done with any number of drugs, usually a combination of several drugs.  Propofol is excellent, but is one of the easiest to slip into general anesthesia, and can really drop your blood pressure and cause you to stop breathing.  That's why you need someone who is doing nothing but watching you.

Personally, I wouldn't have a dentist or oral surgeon sedate me or anyone I love.  When my daughter had her wisdom teeth out, an anesthesiologist did her anesthesia, which was an intravenous general.

These are all names that guard the other teams best player and I while I haven't seen much of J-smoove play this season I'd say DeMarre has more overall impact than both him and Kawhi on his team's success. I'll have to look into Defensive Win Shares, but from what I've seen DeMarre has an enormous impact on our team on defense and offense. We don't really have a legit rim protector since Horford went down, so we have to make our defensive stops on the perimeter and that's where our man JYD excels.

You're also completely ignoring my entire argument that the court forces the uninvolved parent to pay child support because *the child has a right to BOTH its parents' resources*. And that's not at all gendered. Men who raise children alone due to an uninvolved mother can just as easily get forced child support from her via the courts.

Gapinthesidewalk,AskMen,1390968677.0,"&gt;Self improvement is masturbation. Now self destruction...

In all honestly though. The whole self improvement movement or whatever you want to call it is a response to the whole generation Y being gangbanged by technology. Generally speaking, there's a lot more out there to entertain and placate the average person whether it be streaming any number of TV shows on Netflix to video games, and the internet. The amount of content available these days is endless. Now, I myself, am guilty of buying into this technology coping mechanism. If I had spent half of my time in high school interacting with other kids and being involved in sports or something, maybe I wouldn't be trying to re-build my social skills 5 years later, but YMMV depending on how much you bought into it as a kid.

As a result of my apathetic approach, I was slightly overweight, lacked several social skills such as maintaining a conversation, making friends, and generally the whole dating department, and when I got to college, I got motivated to change that. Of course, years later here I am still scared shitless to invoke or escalate any kind of romantic/sexual interaction, but baby steps, I guess.

But you can see where my point is stemming from. The advent of the internet and ramping up of video games completely blindsided generation Y. Generation X had video games sure, but they for the most part lacked the story-esque escapism that most games these days have. Instead of marathoning Doom 3, they were hanging out at the mall and talking to girls, playing pickup sports, and generally figuring out what works in certain social situations and what doesn't. It's only when Gen Y grew up that they realized ""Oh shit, there's a bunch of stuff that I missed and now I have to fix it."" I'm just glad that the thing that condemned me (internet), is also the thing that holds many of the answers for people everywhere."

ImmaRussian,AskMen,1390969167.0,"They're not full of it.

It has happened. I've had girls just straight up ask me to have sex with them, and it didn't creep me out.

What creeps me out is when someone keeps trying to make something happen after they've been rejected.

I think at some level this is at the heart of ""Creepy."" If someone realizes they've been rejected and they keep trying, that tells me that they want to be with me and they aren't overly concerned with whether or not I like them. That just feels rape-y. 

Sometimes people give subtle rejections and think they're more obvious than they actually are, and if someone just misses a cue, they can easily be labelled creepy. I try to take this into account; if I've given someone a subtle rejection and they don't take the hint, that's fine; if I make it obvious for an extended period of time or state it directly and she's still very direct, that's creepy. It takes a lot to creep me out, but it has happened.

I went on a date with a girl once and made it clear that I didn't want a second date. She asked me to come to a club thing, and specifically said we should hang out again, to which I said 'I'll probably be busy for awhile', and I said I might show up to the club thing, then I didn't.

Later she complained about her printer and asked me to come over to fix it... I thought she just wasn't taking the hint, so I thought ""maybe we can still be friends, but I'm sure as Hell not going over to 'fix her printer'."" We saw each other again later at a gathering for an event and she asked me to come over to help her fix her printer... I was stuck on campus for the next hour but I didn't actually have anything to do there.

I indicated that I didn't want to go back to her dorm. She asked me if I had any classes to go to in that hour, I said no. She asked if I had anything to do, and I said ""Well no, but-"" and she said ""Well then there's no reason you can't come over, so you should come help me with my computer.""

She could clearly see that I wasn't in to her and she was still making very obvious moves, and more importantly she intentionally put me in a position that she knew would make me uncomfortable in order to get her way.

Then, at long last, I was creeped out and angry. I went to her dorm. I looked at her computer. I was *polite* but I didn't try to be sociable or nice anymore. She tried to show off her German skills while we were walking there. I interrupted and completely walked all over her with a tirade in German that she didn't understand a word of. When we got there, I asked her for hardware and software specifications on her computer, which she didn't know, diagnosed the problem, and left as soon as it was mildly polite to do so. She texted and asked me to hang out later. I did not respond.

I've been mildly creeped out before a few times, but that's the only time I've ever been completely creeped out by anyone."
LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390969175.0,"I'm so sad that the original Alice is not on steam. :( Now that's a game I would love to have an HD/slightly spruced up version for. 

My personal ""just relax quickly after work"" + like the visuals game is Race the Sun, but I could picture it not working that way for many people because you can crash easily. I personally brush that off, but apparently it can make other people rage. 

I've also used Awesomenauts that way (as a tiny pick-me-upper) and I'm really enjoying Prince of Persia 2008 right now, which somebody here recommended once. It's so weird, in a world used to brutal execution moves, to see a game that is so .... benign. 

I remember the game getting hated on for ""doing away with death"" but from a mere game mechanic POC all that does is working as an instant checkpoint reset (reminded kinda of the superquick reloads of Super Meatboy), only rather than a ""falls to his gory death and gets impaled on spikes"" animation a different animations plays. That said, to me the thing that makes the game benign is how a lot of the villains just flee or disperse after you fight them, again, in the place of brutal execution moves and the overall game just has this light fairy tale/desire to present its visually pretty world feel to it. 

It kinda has some of the elements that are really hated on nowadays probably kind of early, but I find the way they are implemented really interesting. Like, it has a very straight up ""where to go next"" system, but it only appear when you call on it. Or you can have additional lore and additional character building via a dedicated ""talk to Elika"" button, but again completely optional. The story is as deep and (mini) cut scene/exposition heavy as you want it to. It's up to you how much you want the Prince and Elika to talk/how tight you want their relationship to be in that way. "

Ironfist,Bitcoin,1390969218.0,"Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are peer to peer, there is no centralized service like Paypal used to send money.  One of the main benefits of crypto currencies is that they cut out the middle man.  If I want to send money I click send and paste in an address, done.  No wire transfer fees, no check cashing fees, no conversion fees, etc.

To answer your second question, you do not have to buy coins, you can also mine them.  You could also take payment for selling goods and services in bitcoin instead of USD.  You could even get your employer to pay you in BTC.

When, not if, your hard drive dies you can restore your wallet from backups (you do have backups, right?).  Paper wallets would work during a power outage assuming you have some prepared ahead of time.  Same thing applies with USD.  How do you access your money if all the banks have no power?"

keypuncher,politics,1390969395.0,"&gt; But the insurance plans being cancelled were the choice of the insurance companies...

No, the law required the plans go away.

&gt; ...as long as they didn't make drastic changes to the billing structure by 2010 they were grandfathered into the program.

For 1 year.

&gt;  If you had a health care policy through your work, it doesn't matter if they changed it or not, the law had no effect.

...except for massive cost increases.  I, for example, am one of the lucky ones who had insurance through work, and who kept the same plan.  ...only my cost went up 19%.

&gt; People are signing up, upwards of 6 million by this guy's count.

Of those, how many already had insurance before it was canceled?

How many went into Medicaid, and how many of those would have signed up for Medicaid without the law?

How many more lost insurance because their plans were canceled and have not been able to get new insurance yet?

&gt; And medicaid expansion was included in the ACA. ACA money was given to the states at the start for them to handle as they see fit. My main point is that it is a funded expansion.

It is funded by borrowing.  We don't actually have the money to fund it - we're spending more than half a $trillion per year of money we don't have.  All that borrowing is money we have to pay interest on every year... funded by more borrowing.  Does that seem like sound fiscal policy to you?"

FeatherDie,AskWomen,1390969819.0,"I feel pretty squidgy when minors are looking at my body specifically, but I also realize it's a time of learning. Not everyone's parents teach them not to stare or that it's natural to be attracted to the opposite sex (even at a very young age). I totally had the hots for some male actors before sexual maturity, although I didn't really know why I felt that way. If it ever got to the point where it was distracting I would just say something. ""It's impolite to stare young man.""

Older men aren't quite as inclined to stare at me. I get compliments or the occasional flirty older man joke. It's not usually a problem. Older men don't get a free pass just because they look like my grandfather. ""It's very impolite to stare young man."" works the same. My angry mom face usually works pretty well too.

I have to admit that some things older people do just don't bother me as much as they used to. After working with seniors in healthcare for so long, I learned to nip the bad behavior in the bud and try to accept compliments when appropriate."

And for fucks sake don't have even a puff of smoke when you think you're not addicted any more. I went 7 months cold turkey, was feeling great and one day my brain convinced me to say *yeah, you're in Europe on holidays, have a celebration cigar because you're totally over smoking now!* Bam, that same day I bought a packet and smoked more than I did before I quit the first time.

I just don't like it how they nerf what people consider ""OP"" instead of letting counters build up around it, which happens most of the time in Dota.

23skiddsy,gifs,1390970545.0,"Honestly, I have a hard time with the western pleasure jog being forced in QH as well. (My history with horses is through 4H - got lots of exposure to Western Pleasure and Reining) I've heard discussion of how incredibly awkward it is for the horses, but yet it keeps being a trait forced in the horses.

However, I've heard claims you NEED an HYPP positive horse to do well in halter. And there are people who keep breeding HYPP positive horses knowing that they're spreading a condition. They keep breeding it because the firing in the muscles caused by HYPP causes a more ""cut"" looking musculature that happens with fitness in other horses. There are people purposefully breeding for this genetic disorder in horses because judges unknowingly reward it.

Personally, I'd refuse HYPP positive horses (or at least stallions) to be registered for the purpose of breeding (In any horse breed that gets crossbred with QHs, too, like APHA) - I'd do the same if a dog was a carrier for collie eye anomaly, or similar simple-inheritance genetic disorders - the breeds I'm most familiar with - the herding group - generally refuse entry to the breed clubs if the breeder is known to partake in merle X merle breedings, as double merle is a really terrible condition.

I personally believe every dog should at least pass and instinct test (such as the herding instinct test) or title in that breed's respective sport (lure coursing, herding, pointing, retreiving, earthdog) before they're bred, but that's me.

I've got a problem with judges that favor extremes in any kind of conformation judging, so I don't disagree, really! I have a problem with bad-hipped GSD - but I like that some of the (the German fancy is as bad as the US) european GSD fancy favors a much stronger [topline](http://www.germanshepherdplanet.com/user_images/3723097.jpg). All-Breed judges also seem to agree that the current conception of GSD are too extreme. (Or at least I've never seen an extreme-topline GSD win big - I find [this](http://www.giantlands.co.uk/resources/_wsb_642x424_prada%2BBest%2Bin%2Bshow%2Bweb.jpg) fine - it'd have a straight topline out of stack, I think)

I'm so used to standard stacking I find it hard to evaluate what the ""real"" topline of GSD are when they have such a stupid stack. No dog stands like that for real."

If they're paying a lot of attention to me (i.e not a group conversation), I get kinda blushy and stammer a lot. I sometimes also forget what I'm saying before I say it or mid-sentence. It all feels kinda dreamy, but I bet I look like an idiot throughout the process.

On the other side of the word ""intimidating"" I'm sometimes afraid of men that I'm attracted to because I feel like they'd have an easier time assaulting me because I kind of like them. I have a thing for big, gruff guys, so maybe that has something to do with it.

Almost none of which they ever actually have except, as you say, via youtube.

The vast majority of their archive is clearly from when they started recording around when Jon Stewart took over, which was in 1999, and Putin only came to power in 2000 after yeltsin.  It's pretty rare for them to have much from before 1999 on there.  

I remember back in the mid 1990's having 4 port capture cards from ATI (what is now AMD) for just this sort of thing and for things like recording security camera footage, whether they had bigger setups for entertainment I don't know.  I still run one actually, but it's only a single stream these days as it has gradually failed over the last 18 years or so.  

These things aren't exactly new.  

But yes, back then a lot of the tagging would have been manual prior to about 1990, or you would have needed some custom  hardware that I never saw.  Though there were captioning boxes prior too that, but my memory doesn't go back 25 years on these things.  http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/OSEC/library/legislative_histories/1395.pdf  is the law that required decoding tools for closed captioning to be in TV's, so presumably in the US captioning was broadcasting before then.

Give it some time, and be thankful. Me and the Mrs. have had several unfortunate gaming experiences with friends which I like to label as ""train wrecks of unbridled enthusiasm."" In short, I have been so exuberant to play board games that I have sometimes hurt our chances of recruiting new people into the hobby rather than helped.
 
In one of my first game sessions, I made the mistake of busting out Munchkin having never played it before and not everyone was of the dungeon-delving back-stabbing sort. 

I didn't know my audience.

Still, hope remains.

For instance, right now I've backed off trying to get a game like Dominion or Pandemic to the table, games that we started off on... instead I've stuck to party games (Say Anything and CAH have been successful so far) and light fillers (Zombie Dice.) By doing this, I've been able to gauge interest and earn credibility: ""Hey, schm0 brings fun games that I've never seen before, so I'll be more willing to try something outside my comfort zone next time.""

Some people will just never be into (let alone have the time for) a game like TI3. That's just a fact of gaming. Gauge your friends, and ask them directly what they liked about the games they play. 

Sometimes you need to bridle your enthusiasm and settle for games you prefer less, otherwise you run the risk of alienating or discouraging your friends altogether. Focus on the experience of the game: the time you spend with your friends is far more important.

I'm not sure if you were looking for advice or not, but there it is anyways. :)"

rowd149,programming,1390971736.0,"&gt;Your response really bothered me. It's not even the tone, its that there is no way of arguing without being considered ""wrong"".

***So then maybe you're wrong.*** God forbid you actually admit it and change your behavior. I haven't even read the rest of your post yet because I'm trying to wrap my head around you having this moment of near-salience followed by what looks like a wall of rationalization. 

Edit: Okay, I read it. You're still wrong. This bikeshedding bullshit principally, because while you sit here and say that we're making a big deal out of something insignificant, *I can say the same thing* because you're putting up such a fight over a *name*. We get it, it's a joke, you didn't mean it to be off-putting. *It's still off-putting.* I'm sure Rick Perry had some great memories of N\*\*\*\*rhead, but he was running for president, so he couldn't call it N\*\*\*\*rhead anymore. So the rational (there's that word again), adult thing to do would be to say, ""It was fun, but we're alienating colleagues and the functionality is what's important, not the label, so we'll change the name."" 

Boom.

End of controversy.

The only thing lost is the smug sense of old boys' club in-joke exclusivity, but then you're at work anyway. 

I'm not even going to touch the public shaming bit, because if you are a self-respecting geek, you should already know the injustice of being the kid who hits back and gets in trouble, and therefore see what kind of bullshit it is to go after the person who publicized bad behavior that shouldn't be happening in the first place."

As someone who chose to quit voting in elections from here on out I strongly disagree and see it as a more radical act than continually choosing to increase the amount of evil preferred in politicians. How many times can you increase the the increments of evil before the poison kills the country?

On the other hand, simply refusing to endorse one over the other frees you to criticize all sides of issues free of partisan biases and delegitimizes the whole system. Who can claim to have a mandate when the number of voters decline into the lower thirties?

From there, many community colleges in many states have articulation agreements with 4 year schools so that as long as you get your 2 year associates degree you are guaranteed to be admitted to their schools to finish your final 2 for a bachelor's.

Most overweight people I know who have lost the weight don't try to help others by just saying ""Eat less, exercise more.""

CareToJoinMe,SportingKC,1390973247.0,"&gt; I'm thinking we might see him on the field sooner than I expected when we announced a 16-year old signing last year.

We're probably not going to. I know theres a lot of hype, but he's still only 16. He has a long ways to go to be able to be mentally at the MLS level. When they signed him Peter Vermes made it clear its going to be a while before he'd be ready to even be a semi-regular. They  wanted him to develop at his own pace and this sudden hype really doesn't help with that.

Theres footage, but it isn't going to let you know what to expect because the level and style of play of everything he's played in is going to be entirely different from MLS. At the MLS level, at his current size (he will get bigger and probably bulk up a little bit) he can't be the physically dominant force he currently is at his age group. EPB is aware of that, which is why he models his game after Besler and is striving to be more of a cerebral CB (his words). But he still has a long ways to go to be able to read the pace of MLS and to be able to consistently adapt at that level. Which is why its important he isn't rushed just because Juventus is (allegedly) knocking.

I've seen him play a bit, been following him a bit since before he was signed and I don't even think I'm qualified to tell you what to expect from him longterm outside of what I've already said. I think hardly anyone truly does outside of scouts and coaches and even then you're basing everything off of potential. Its just funny how when the rumor popped up, suddenly a bunch of people who barely even knew he existed prior (if at all) were experts on who he was and whats good for him. Don't look too much into people's personal scouting reports. He's a big kid for his age with a good brain. Everything else is potential and development.

No. The page you linked yourself explains how this is not true.

You cannot get a Skilled Worker visa without a job offer, so coming over and applying straight away will not work.

~~The 6 month period is not a tourist visa, that's a job seeking period you can stay for **if** you register as a jobseeker within 3 months of arriving.~~ EDIT: The 6 month arrangement seems to only exist for citizens of countries that do not need a visa in Norway, sadly. Norway is in Schengen, so tourist visa only lasts 3 months. Also note that after the 6 months as a jobseeker you have to leave Norway for at least 3 months. This is a Schengen rule.

All that being said, a bachelors in marketing sadly aint much. What /u/whiteraven4 says is true; the job market is very tough for foreigners, especially those who do not speak the language. Your chances of getting an offer of employment with your qualifications are very low."

In their defense they probably only made her like that to emphasize her youth/inexperience at the time, but it's still nearly impossible to forgive someone for screwing up the image of a game so badly. 

Retro Studio did such a damn fine job with Prime because they were moving it over from a 2D series to a 3D series and were under a lot of pressure from fans who didn't even want a 3D version and trying to figure out how to accurately convert the mechanics of a 2D platformer into a 3D First Person game.

Team Ninja really had no real work to do when it came to making *Other M* because Prime already existed. The 3D model for metroid had been perfected and hammered out into a solid design by Retro and the only way to really attract people to the new Ninja rendition was doing something so different that nobody could really compare it to Prime."

LyssaBrisby,femalefashionadvice,1390974364.0,"The more I think about this, the more I think of how hard it is to approach highly formalized and monitored cultural events from a non-standard position. Brides are such charged symbols, and they Look A Certain Way, which is what makes them Brides, etc.

When I married my husband, our 2 year old son was in attendance as the ringbearer. Given our non-standard timing, I did *not* feel comfortable wearing a pure white dress, and any dress available with colour was usually pure white... plus red! Or pure white... plus black! etc. The all-over colours like ""rum pink"" (almost whitish blush) and ""champagne"" (almost whitish goldish) were effectively white unless you held a sheet of paper up to them. None of it felt right; in fact we rejected an officiant because her execrable vows involved the exchange of white roses of purity and I was like *do you see my son over there playing with his rattle.* I didn't want to avoid the white symbol because I actually thought I was impure as a mother marrying for the second time -- but that I didn't want people to *think* that I was clinging to those notions of purity, if that makes any sense. I knew that my uniform was a communication, whether I liked it or not. I ended up designing and having my gown custom made in a muted rainbow of antique creams, golds, and burgundies, with a green sash, and it made all the difference to my level of comfort on the day.

So, in weddings symbols play such a huge role, the uniforms dovetail with that, and everyone is always on the lookout for how people present themselves through those uniforms, so feeling hyper-examined isn't actually inaccurate. I wonder if your fianc√©e is struggling with the possibility of be pigeonholed as ""the butch one,"" or ""the man"" if she goes for suiting, because ignorant people to tend to reach for familiar labels when they're caught flat-footed. Of course there's undoubtedly there is so much to her than ""quasi-groom"" -- and not only will the right uniform make her feel and look feminine and truly herself, she perhaps also needs a reminder that no one worthy of an invitation to your event will dismiss or pigeonhole her as anything less than the full wholeness of herself, even if she shows up in a tux."

Here's the thing that never made sense to me: if you want to play pro football, you have to go to college and play for free for four years. That means that you are working for the college, making no money (okay now they get a stipend to cover expenses but still can't get a paid job), while everyone else gets rich (the schools, the tv networks, the ncaa bureaucracy, video game companies, sports wear companies). Plus you better hope you don't get hurt and if so, too bad.

If you make it through college without getting too badly injured, being suspended for any ridiculous rules the ncaa made up, or being put on academic probation, AND if you're good enough to make it in the NFL, congrats! Your years of playing for free have paid off!

It just doesn't make sense that every kid that wants to be in the NFL must go to college first and play for free (and can't unionize). Trust me, I'm pro-education, but we don't require a college education here in the US. Don't be fooled, it's all about making money. "

My biggest problem with teaching is that I felt like the job didn't fit what I wanted (I missed learning) and I felt like I didn't fit the job entirely. 

Furthermore, I found it extremely depressing/alarming that I was the science expert. I was the new hire into the department, and I, maybe a year out of undergrad, was the expert in the department. I was the only teacher in the department with a science degree. I was assigned (and paid) to stay after school to help tutor **the other teachers**. Don't get me wrong, the science department chair was an excellent teacher - her classroom management skills were some of the best I've ever seen, and her students respected her dedication and passion for teaching, but, at least in this day and age, **you really don't need to know your subject matter to be a damn good teacher**. I find that particularly troubling, and that fact alone ate at my sanity for two and a half years.

So long story short, I just didn't feel like I fit. I decided to work the four years needed to clear my credential (I'm credentialed until 2015, and renewal is a cinch!) and then apply to graduate school. When my students found out that I was leaving, they were sad, but many of them told me something along the lines of: ""Good for you Mr. Bigtcm. You were too smart to be a teacher anyway. Go do something bigger than teach us kids."" 

Education is a topic that is very close to my heart, and although I don't think I'm going to return to the classroom as a teacher ever again, I think I'd still want to work in education after I get my degree. Maybe as a consultant. Maybe be one of those few district bureaucrats who know what they're talking about. I know many universities have an educational outreach program. I'd love to be involved in one of those too."

RoseOfSharonCassidy,popping,1390975778.0,"Ingrowns can swell that much, it probably is an ingrown.

Clean it, pat dry with clean cotton balls, put benzoyl peroxide on it (common acne medication, brand names are persa-gel-10, pan-oxyl, store-brand), allow medicine to dry completely, put a hydrocolloid bandage on it, and let it sit for 24 hours (hydrocolloids are often called ""blister bandages"" in stores).  Then peel off the bandage and see what's underneath.  It should have dried up considerably and come closer to the surface.  Then stick a warm compress on it for 15-20 minutes... it should be very close to popping at this point and you can try to pop it with an [extraction tool](http://www.lovelyskin.com/o/tweezerman-no-slip-skin-care-tool?ref=gbase&amp;gclid=CJGnuPjborwCFacDOgodpSAArQ) or tease the hair out with tweezers.  You should be able to get all of the supplies I mentioned for about $10-15 at any drugstore.

In the future, he can use salicylic acid to prevent ingrown hairs.  Salicylic acid is also a common acne medication and goes by many brand names.  Personally I prefer stridex (in the red box, the ""max strength"" ones) because it's the strongest salicylic acid available without a prescription, the pads are really convenient, and it's $3.50 for 90 pads.

Oh, and if your boyfriend starts to run a fever, it gets more swollen, it starts to throb, it gets bigger than a pea, it starts getting discolored, or anything doesn't seem quite right, go see a doctor asap because in rare occasions, an ingrown can turn into staph/mrsa."

**Maleny**. There's some nice old buildings and on weekends lots of motorbikes. A good place to visit even if you don't take any photos. Also Gardener's Falls has some lovely waterways and usually some tourists, some of whom are photogenic.

What's wrong with visual basic or C#? C# is a very powerful language for certain things. Seeing as how you're a HS student, I can literally feel the entitledness and the need to prove yourself to the grown ups coming through.

Don't be such a smug little kid and be focused on merits, not what your peers think of a platform. Use what works, not what you think is cool.

Carrying on, the rest of your post makes no sense either: ""Robust graphics support"", what in blazes are you talking about? I think you're trying to make a game on Linux, for Linux -- correct? There are plenty of libraries and suites that you can use to deal with accelerated graphics. You should visit /r/gamedev for more info, read their faq on the side bar. No language specializes in graphics rendering (perhaps high level shaders, but that's out of the question here). Your language of choice will interface with renderer APIs. Python has wrappers that will drive the renderer. If you're looking for a Maya/Cinema4D like tool chains where you script your 3D polies, or drive your rigging, then no, there's no such thing in the generalized world of programming.

Also, if your interests are AI and cryptography, what are you doing fussing about with graphics?

Off hand question, do you even have the supporting mathematical background to comprehend matrix operations? Graphics and crypto make heavy uses of matrix (linear algebra) and those ops are usually created for implementation purposes because theory is mostly calculus.

Lastly, computer science is not code. You can get a PhD in computer science without knowing more than one language and being a half ass coder. Logical thinking, analysis and mathematical fineness is required for this field.

There's a nearby pub that all our friends would gather at that we liked to frequent. Sometimes we'd spend the night together, but other times we'd go our separate ways to mingle with our respective groups of friends. I'd shoot pool and shoot the shit with people. She'd go out dancing on the dance floor. We'd check in with each other throughout the night with random kisses, hugs, and whispers into my ear, but for the most part, we can do our own thing. Sometimes though, when guys would start to come on to her too hard, she'd find me, give me a deep long kiss, and introduce me as her boyfriend. Or she'll find a way to lock eyes with mine and would give me that super sexy ""come hither"" look.

And at the end of the night, we'd meet up again, and head out the way we came in, hand in hand.

&gt;One of the things I do recall though is that at some point she tried to have sex with me and as soon as I realized what she was trying to do I told her no, I didn't want to have sex. Pretty positive she listened to me from then on out.  

He was coherent the entire time and has full recollection of doing many sexual acts with the girl, all of which were consensual. He then says she tried to initiate full blown sex with him and he said no and she immediately stopped, he just wasn't sure if he stopped her before he penetrated her. And I'm sorry, but if you have said yes to every type of sexual act up until this point and don't say anything against having sex it is reasonable to assume at the age of 23 that it will lead to sex, and trying to initiate it doesn't constitute rape if everything else has been consensual and there has been no sign that he didn't want to. The fact that she stopped immediately shows there was no malicious intent and she respected his boundaries as soon as she knew what they were.

HTML5 apps have a lower bar for entry vs. Objective C or Java however (native languages), so this gives an assumed larger base of developers to create more apps than before. This could be good for all parties to an extent. There are IDE's that support HTML5 development already however, that don't require Google as a necessary service. Google clearly is showing support, but it's not without their interests in mind I'm sure.

I prefer native apps however for performance reasons. Facebook switched to native on iOS a while ago for this very reason. It was sluggish and could not do what they wanted it do without going native. There's a tradeoff for ease of entry vs. performace here. It all depends."

You'd be surprised how entrenched the business world is in vb. VB may not be cool, but it's the language banks run on (aside from COBOL/Fortran).

&gt;better graphics support 

You need to understand what Directx/[opengl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) are first. Then you need to understand exactly [where they sit](http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~stan/classes/CS355/notes/images/AndroidSoftwareStack.png) in relative space to [the OS Kernel](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Linux_Graphics_Stack_2013.svg).

As you can see, OpenGL is quite independent of coding platform. It is a system library-- abstracting, unifying and simplifying hardware access and operations on wide range of graphics hardware.

Almost every language out there has a api wrapper for this library, allowing your software to communicate with it. IDE has no bearing, and the language platform has no bearing. And yes, VB also has ogl wrappers."

True survival anarchy servers have no rules other than no cheating. Raiding is a standard acceptable way to get resources. It's truly the most thrilling way to play minecraft, but it gets relatively little attention because very few Let's Players do them, because footage of gameplay can reveal your location. Soon as you use f3 or view your coordinates, or even look around too much on the surface above your base(you're stupid if you build above ground), you're toast, as other players can watch your LP and get an idea of your location. On top of that, it's very hard to run a good anarchy server, because cheating is common. Harsh punishments deter many, but not all, and even xray texture packs can provide a tremendous advantage. Consequently, it takes a large, dedicated team of admins who can invisibly watch players, and catch them in the act, or, it takes a whitelist server where all the players know eachother and trust eachother not to cheat.

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1390979144.0,"&gt;What is a good replacement that won't make me break out? As well as a blush?  

I'm not sure if you're specifically asking for a contouring product that is a blush or two separate recommendations one for a contouring product and one for a blush. 

If you're just asking for a contouring product, I think it would be helpful for you to compare ingredients of NYX taupe with other products you use on your face to see what's making you break out. I think it's a bit hard for anyone to recommend something that would be guaranteed not to break you out without knowing precisely what you're sensitive to. If you are asking for a blush shade in addition to a contouring shade, again it would be helpful to know what you're sensitive to and what you're currently using now (if you're looking for a similar color).

Some general suggestions: If there is a foundation shade from the same line you're currently using that hasn't broken you out that would work for contouring you might try that. This is rather unlikely if NYX taupe is a good match for you though as it's rather grey-ish and foundations tend not to want to be that way. "

bechampions,SquaredCircle,1390979495.0,"I love ADR for a number of reasons. And someone mentioned it here on wreddit a few days/weeks ago. He's in many ways the Mexican Bret Hart. 

*He can shoot wrestle. 

*He is a phenomenal technician and can work with just about anyone and make them look good.

*He goes against the stereotype of the Mexican wrestler. He's a big guy who doesn't do flips and shit. 

*He grew up with the business and learned his craft from some of the biggest legends in the world of wrestling.

Unfortunately, I think the language/culture barrier is his biggest issue. Sure he speaks pretty good English, but the way he talks, I feel like he has to pause, think, and translate what he's gonna say before he actually says it. And many fans consider that to be boring.

Not really fair comparisons. Their career trajectories aren't really based on one being athletic and the other being more athletic. Tim Ream for example isn't really an easy one to gauge. He was pretty mediocre that second season and was purchased more because of what he *could* do. He wasn't great his second year in NY, but has done well enough since his move. Ike on the other hand has struggled with injuries, which has prevented him from consistent playing time and being able to get set in his role. He needed a new start and Kansas City has provided that for him. Ike even displaced SKC's stalwart CBs for periods of the season, causing some to think he should take MLS MVP Collin's role.

thesilvertongue,Christianity,1390979634.0,"It may seem purely religious at first (Christians vs. Muslims) but that's probably not the whole story. Nigeria is has a long history of ethnic violence that predates both religions. 

British colonialism was strongest in the South hence the tendency towards Christianity. As a result, the Christian southern tribes have more wealth and control over industries. Not to mention, the south is full of oil. British colonialism, which educated and converted only certain tribes, further exacerbated inequality and ethnic tensions. 

There is a ton of political, economic, and cultural tension between different ethnic groups in Nigeria. Keep in mind that these groups not only practice different religions, but also speak different languages from completely different language families, have different lifestyles, and come from completely different cultures. Few few of these cleavages are cross-cutting. 

Many of these ethic groups want independence or autonomy. A mere 40 years ago these groups were in the midst of a civil war which killed nearly 1 million people. 

The oil industry in Nigeria is also a huge source of ethnic violence. In the 1990s, various ethic groups began in the Niger Delta to militarize to fight for control of petroleum resources. While the violence peaked around 03-04, it still continues today. Now the Niger Delta coast is second only to Somali in terms of number of pirates.

It's very easy to oversimplify the matter as Christians vs. Muslims but that's probably not a fair way of looking at what happened. There is a lot more going on than two religions. 

The group accused, Boko Harem, is an emerging Islamic fundamentalist group founded in 2001 by Mohammed Yusuf. It's most present in the northern regions control by the Hausa ethnic group. While many believe Boko Harem has connections to Algerian subset of Al Queda, no evidence of any connection has been found. 

Boko Harem has been denounced the Muslim community in Nigeria and the Muslim community at large.

the joint and bone pain feels like having a sledgehammer taken to my back. The nerve pain where I have a nerve hitting a bone is a very sharp pain like having a knife stabbed into the very specific spot.

I also at times have muscular pain due to muscle spasms. The body trying to protect the injured/hurt areas.  Those are tight, feels like a knot, and sometimes like a true spasm.

You said you feel like you are being stung by bees. Is it something you feel at the skin level or is it something that is deep? like do you feel like it is happening in the bone, organ, or what not?

just trying to brainstorm. Different pains will respond to different things and again different people will respond differently.

Cyclists definitely are getting a raw deal here, because they don't belong on the road and they don't really belong on the sidewalk either.

AlizarinQ,harrypotter,1390980746.0,"You are defining morality of every house by single event of The Battle of Hogwarts, and primarily by the students old enough to stick around to fight and the teachers of Hogwarts.

So of the adults we have the teachers who chose to defend  the school, and the death eaters who chose to attack the school. What house they each originated from was less of a determining factor than what they had chosen to do with their lives.

And of the students we have those who had been systematically abused for the past year by death eaters, and the slytherins.

Not that the slytherin students were free of abuse entirely, because if their parents were death eaters then they were also hostages dependent on their parents behavior, and vis versa- Narcissa and Lucius with Malfoy for example. 

And the children of death eaters knew that, if they were to take up arms against the death eaters, they would not only be directly fighting their parents and other relatives, but also giving Voldemort reason to hurt, maim, or kill their parents and relatives.

It wasn't a black and white choice for the slytherin students. It is easy to view it as such from Harry's point of view, but even if the slytherins wanted to defend Hogwarts it might have made more sense (for the sake of their loved ones) to avoid combat all together. "

**Blood of Elves** by Andrej Sapkowski. This is the book series that the Witcher games are based on. Yes, Geralt does get a fair bit of sex in the short stories and in the games, but in these books Yennifer (his main love interest) is alive and there is a lot of things going wrong between them. In true manly fashion Geralt deals with this by ignoring it. The fulfillment of a prophecy promising destruction of the world helps keep his mind off her.

**Servant of the Underworld** by Allitte De Boddard. For religious reasons, the main character is celibate. Not the religion you are thinking of, he happens to be the Mayan high priest of the dead. This book is set soon after he gets the position and is a murder mystery with magic, gods and blood sacrifice. Actually a lot of fun to read, but I will warn you that other people's sex lives play a part in the mystery.

**Goblin Adventurer** by Jim C. Hines. There's absolutely no relationships in this one, but that may have to do with all the characters being evil, backstabbing, dirty goblins. They are however hilarious in their self destructive incompetence. A typical party of adventurers descends into a goblin cave in search of fame and fortune, and captures one of the weakest goblins as a guide. Lucky for them they also got one of the smartest.

But the thing is, thus far it's been an invisible disease. I'm 27, I look about 23, I even look like I weigh less than I do. Which really only means I look about 180 lbs when I'm really about 220, but still, it's chubby.

kilgore_trout8989,sex,1390981395.0,"Wait, I'm pretty sure that means like at least 50% of the (developed country) population is fucked in that regard anyways because of the prevalence of oral HSV-1.  Which, unless you're willing to go to *extreme* lengths, is pretty hard to avoid.  And that's assuming you didn't pick up the disease as a child before you even knew what the fuck Herpes was, which most people did.

Also, the new targeted antivirals (e.g. Valtrex) seem to help significantly according to your link.

&gt;With the development of specific antiviral agents, it is now often possible to maintain the level of immunosuppression required to prevent graft rejection. The drug of choice against CMV is intravenous ganciclovir. Under conditions of ganciclovir resistance or a failure of ganciclovir treatment, foscarnet or cidofovir is often used. Foscarnet is also given intravenously but has several serious side effects, including nephrotoxicity, nausea, vomiting, anemia, and seizures (52). Cidofovir, a nucleotide analog of cytosine, is not herpes specific and has activity against several other viruses, including adenovirus, hepatitis B virus, and human papillomavirus (102). Its use is limited by significant nephrotoxicity.

&gt;Valganciclovir and valacyclovir are newer drugs currently under investigation for treatment of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Both drugs can be administered orally and have increased oral bioavailability compared to that of acyclovir or ganciclovir (60). The effective use of oral antiviral agents for both prevention (valacyclovir and ganciclovir) and treatment (valganciclovir) of CMV disease would represent a significant improvement in CMV disease therapy among transplant recipients. However, the ease of administration of these drugs also leads to a substantial risk of inappropriate overuse and increased viral resistance."

In the books it turns into a despotism (and the explanation of how a single being can become a despot over so many others over such an area is pretty good.)

Next one I can think of is **Hellhole** by Kevin J. Anderson. It's not at the level of detail of the previous recommendations, but it's still an exploration of political and economic power in a multi star system empire.

**Polity** novels by Neal Asher. The one I can think of is **Line War** but I know that is late in the series. AI control and governance of the empire, and a discussion of how the empire absorbs new planets and reacts to external threats.

One left I can think of **The Prefect** by Alistar Reynolds. It's a series of semi-independent space habitats rather then planets, but it functions similarly enough that you could refer to it.

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390982328.0,"I'm no expert but my take on this is: 

- Just be concious of what kind of feedback she gives you. Does she seem into the conversation? Then proceed. If not. Back off. =&gt; this goes for every step on the way, just because she is cool with talking doesn't mean she wants to add you, just because she adds you doesn't mean she wants to date. Each individual step has to be checked separatedly (also be aware that she could already have a boyfriend). I'd also suggest: You could also give her your summoner name and leave it up to her to add you or not. 

I don't think that there is a firm rule on exchanging phone numbers (or skype or teamspeak), it all depends on how well you are hitting it off/how much you have in common, etc. 

As a conversation starter, personally, I'd start with asking which pro-teams she supports, gabbing about favorite players/plays from that team and eventually asking her what champions she plays which probably leads to joined shop talk anyway. Whether she had to travel far/where she comes from or whether she has been to any tournaments before might also be a topic that arises naturally in this situation. 

ETA: Some other tips I want to throw out there. 

- Don't be afraid to appraoch a girl who is there with other girls. I know it seems more intimidating but the chances of a girl who is there with a female friend being single are actually quite good. 

- I know some dudes are paranoid about ""what if no means yes/she is playing hard to get and I'm missing out on a chance to score if that is the case"" =&gt; don't bother. If she tells you a clear no/not interested at any point, take her word for it. If she were to have been just playing hard to get she probably would have been mean to you anyway/wouldn't have been worth it. Just back off and at worst let her come for you. 

- Don't pressure yourself and just have fun. :) 

- I'm kinda nervous/Are you nervous too can be a really good ice breaker. If you are socially awkward maybe there's a chance she's as well and if she is that gives you another thing to have in common. "

We had one black male that was in his teens, very educated and working on his mind. He come in our shop seeking a refuge of sorts, often looking at our bikes and out the windows, wondering out loud if he would make it to 25 years old.

The 7-11 across the street would have it's dumpster set on fire once a week. Each night, there would be walk out robberies. That would be when someone came in and grabbed a 12 pack of beer out of the cooler and just walk out without paying. No guns, no violence. Just, ""I ain't paying. Just try to do something."" High prices was all they could do.

The small police substation across the way was littered with gun shots to ""celebrate"" the shooting of a local police officer on the anniversary of his death one year. This all happened on the fringe of the the war zone there. There are parts of Omaha that are literally war zones. It's all poverty related, not racially related. I knew plenty of black people in the war zones that were good people, and plenty in west Omaha like Millard. It's resource, not race. Sadly, race congregates a lot in these places.

She was riding in the back seat of a fellow student's car, and was hit in the head by an unsecured stereo speaker when the car spun out and crashed.

SpankWhoWithWhatNow,AskReddit,1390983534.0,"I was a sophomore in high school, and had just gotten out of the shower and ready for school.  As was the routine in the morning, my dad would get up, make coffee, and watch the new/SportsCenter.  As soon as I was out of the shower, he would go for his.  
When I walked out to the living room, he told me about how a plane had hit the World Trade Center.  Looking at the picture, it was hard to tell the scale, and I imagined it'd only been a small private plane, like a Cessna.  It was only shortly after my dad got out of the shower that we both watched live as the 2nd plane hit.  We kind of looked at each other in bewilderment, and realized something was very wrong with what we were watching.  
It was hard to really say what was going through my mind, it's still kind of a blur in that regard.  It all really hit home in the following days, learning how many firefighters and EMS workers had been killed, as my dad was a firefighter/paramedic for well over 30 years.  
In the long run, I'd be lying if I said it didn't have something to do with me leaving a possible full-time job as a firefighter to join the Marines (let alone the infantry), and I certainly consider it the defining moment of my young adulthood.  
  
EDIT: I almost forgot about the bus ride to school and the rest of the day, where we heard about the Pentagon getting hit (obviously real), the rumors of the planes heading for the West Coast, specifically LA, San Francisco, and Seattle, as well as the reports of military planes having shot down at least 1-2 ""suicide jets"" (at the time as real to us as any of the other news being reported)."

However, I can't get enough of the bows when I have a party of 4 and having just started in G rank this week and pretty much still in high rank gear and not confident enough to not be a hindrance as a blademaster, I have really taken to being a status archer. The monsters don't target me as much and when they do, it's either a charge or a beam which are usually very avoidable. I sit back and paralyze them, letting my group absolutely destroy the monster we're fighting. As a blademaster, it was hack and slash and repeat, with being a bow user, I affect the fight and have confirmation that I am destroying the monster. I was just fighting a Barroth today with some folks, and as he was charging me, I had set up a charge 3 pierce shot and sent it through the length of his body, making him flinch (luckily) and allowing for me to get out of the way while the next rain of arrows paralyzed him.

The 4 year old is going through a weird phase and it's tantrums and challenges all the time. During one tantrum, I lost it. I just left the room and let my husband deal with the aftermath. It was the straw that broke the camel's back, that's for sure. A few days later, I told him how I felt through lots of tears and heartache, since I know he's always wanted a big family and I thought I did. 

It went from wanting 3 kids, to 2 just to replace us, to 1 to appease him, to me telling him that if he wants kids, he should leave now because he deserves everything he wants in life. He is really a fantastic person and would be the best dad. 

I raised my siblings during my teen years and I was an abused kid, in many ways. I feel like I've already been a parent and knowing some statistics on abused kids becoming abusers freaks me out, especially after how I felt during the tantrum our friend's kid threw. 

He's being understanding, and said that he doesn't want kids right now and could change his mind in the future, and he tried saying ""Well there's people you could talk to to work through this."" I immediately told him that it isn't something that needs to be fixed and he's been pretty good about it since.

That event will catalyze immediate and spontaneous galvanized action, protest. This triggers blow back, more awareness, more thresholds triggered and more people show up.

To be able to compete with the top people on a server these days, you sometimes need multiple sets of fully enchanted diamond armor, multiple top tier bows and swords, and more. These days, it's dreadfully more complicated to have the best equipment, meaning that established players are much better off, and it becomes more about how long you've been on a server, rather than skill.

Sorcerers, funnily enough, seem to have the fewest direct damage spells, but each of their skill lines has one or two. Remember that you only get 5 skills at a time, and those skills have no cooldown so they can be spammed as quick as you like.

However, even if you are a high magicka ""mage"" you will need to use your weapon eventually because spamming skills should drain your mana no matter how much you level it. It should replenish after not too long, but you will need to use your weapon at least somewhat."

* AMS AMS AMS. Use it all the time. Almost every boss (only exception I can think of off the top of my head is Nazgrim) has some sort of magic damage that you can use it on. It's FREE damage (runic power) and stops you from getting spiked down. I'm shocked at the number of DKs I run with who NEVER pop it, ever. I watch their health just plummet when there's a big spike of magic damage (immerseus adds blowing up, garrosh whirlwinds)

* Gorefiend's Grasp: I run this talent and it comes in handy. Even if you're not the offtank, once you have threat on the main target, don't forget this ability is targeted. For instance, on Garrosh, I'll usually hit the offtank with it to help them collect adds. Don't forget it can be used when a mob is targeted as well, so you can pull the mobs to one mob (useful when they are strung out ranged/casters). 

Not a lot else I can think of as specific DK tips... I don't really use Dark Sim, seems more like a PVP ability to me... "

Jacksambuck,FeMRADebates,1390991303.0,"I really like to go by the finallyfeminism101 site, because it's representative of feminism, and was created specifically to answer critics of feminism.

They see ""Patriarchy Hurts Men too"" as little more than a derailing tactic by critics, use it as synonym for ""What about the menz?""


&gt;FAQ: What‚Äôs wrong with saying that things happen to men, too? 


&gt;Short answer: Nothing in and of itself. The problem occurs when conversations about women can‚Äôt happen on unmoderated blogs without someone showing up and saying, ‚Äúbut [x] happens to men, too!‚Äù (also known as a ‚ÄúPatriarchy Hurts Men, Too‚Äù or PHMT argument, or a ‚ÄúWhat About The Mens?‚Äù or WATM argument).

The article does not address the actual argument (that patriarchy hurts men too, and how it interacts with their theory of one-sided oppression) at all.  The sub-paragraphs are titled: ""When and why PHMT arguments become inappropriate"", ""Why PHMT arguments are so frustrating"", and ""How to avoid getting zinged for a PHMT argument"". 

http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/10/18/phmt-argument/


Lower down the article, you get this:

&gt;The problem with the ‚ÄúPatriarchy Hurts Men, Too‚Äù arguments:

&gt; But what bothers me about the idea of PHMT ‚Äî and the way in which it is being relentlessly promoted ‚Äî is that it trivializes the fact that patriarchy hurts women. Women are the victims of patriarchy, and the suffering of men occurs as a secondary consequence of their role as oppressor.

On this site, interestingly, the lower down the article you get, into the ""Clarifying Concepts"" section, the more hard-line and, imo, honest it gets about feminism. The first answer is usually a smokescreen designed to silence valid criticism. Here the first answer ""there's nothing inherently wrong with PHMT arguments"", is contradicted in the bit I just quote. 


---

&gt;So ultimately, if they accept the existence of patriarchy and if they believe that patriarchy is the cause of all gender injustice, feminists must believe that any and all issues men face are, quite literally, a result of their privilege. Men dying in war, men being stymied in education, men failing to receive adequate care or help, etc. ... all of it is due to the patriarchy -- the societal system of male privilege.

They do. They see female advantages as ""benevolent sexism"", just another symptom of women's oppression.

http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2008/02/09/faq-female-privilege/

Aside from the unfalsifiability of the whole thing, I find it quite disgusting to label stuff like men being forced to die in war and not women as ""benevolent"". "

Robotgorilla,unitedkingdom,1390992767.0,"It's very hard to do satire right. And when feminism is involved it's very hard to get that right too. She was unlucky that all the best dancers to audition for her song were black and she was silly to think that making lines rhyme and have rhythm when talking about feminism is more important than the content (one line in the song sounded disparaging to those who twerked, which all her backing dancers did in the video, pretty much because it fit well and was vaguely feminist sounding).

To make the perfect feminist song (where no one could get offended) it would begin with the female possibly trans queer singer who is either not white or aware of her white privilege and would be a spoken word piece (can't have any music because it is cultural appropriation from somebody) about how all white male heterosexual men are in control and how it's awful.

idiabetic,explainlikeimfive,1390992769.0,"Oil wells often produce natural gas in addition to oil. The difference comes in getting the oil and gas to market, oil is often trucked from the well to the refinery, or nearest pipeline. Gas however, cannot be trucked to market (the gas company as it is not refined) therefore a pipeline has to be built to the well /field. These pipeline costs millions of dollars and as gas sells for around $5 per million cubic feet it is in no way cost effective, especially when the well / field doesn't produce a large amount of gas. Therefore it is flared (burned), flaring is also very safe and every well that is flaring gas is registered and approved by the state and have a ""safety radius"" around them. "

J2Me,AskMen,1390994715.0,"A few things.
Is he watching too much porn?
Same girl over a long time can affect performance.
Too much stress?
Not confident?
Licking you is bound to have a mental aspect that he enjoys, it might be his way of warming up. Also a physical transfer of chemicals that act as an aphrodisiac.

Some things that could help.
More kissing from you (also an aphrodisiac).
Foreplay concentrated on him and how sexy you feel he is to boost a bit of ego and make him feel confident.
Get him to try meditating or relax sometime in case he is too stressed.
Give him a massage that slowly gets more sexual.
More talking dirty about yourself rather than him.
Dress provocatively (this you might need to ask about to find what gets his D hard).

69!!!!!!! Seriously it's the perfect way to push him from just getting hard to wanting to fuck, while he can do something he obviously enjoys.

No porn, masturbating or even sex for a week. NO touching. Don't even look at a naked body. (Don't make it a requirement, just something to try ""because you heard guys that do it have huge loads of cum afterwards and you love that"". Even if you don't.) After this he might find a bit more mojoe for regular everyday sex.

BTW Talking about it might just put more pressure on him. As much as people here love saying ""talk about it"". Sometimes talking about the problem can enhance it. So if you do, be tactful."

[](/twismile) I certainly don't think you're a doucheknob, but -- there's no real reason to assume they're playing Duel Monsters, the fictional card game, is there? Why can't they be playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, the real card game? As in, like, Twilight just went down to the store and got some Yu-Gi-Oh! booster packs and stuff just like you or I would.

A lot of people seem to get angry how Shelton (Gerard Butler) didn't get his revenge, didn't topple the system and was seemingly outsmarted by someone 10 times slower than him. People seem to get fixated on the idea that Shelton had gone mad with vengeance and was trying to bring down the entire criminal justice system, even the entire government. They seem to completely overlook what, in my opinion, was the real goal of Shelton, which was to teach Rice (Jamie Foxx) a lesson, which was thus:

That there are some people in this world whose crimes are so heinous, their personalities and lack of conscience so evil that he must do everything in his power to kill them and not give them any chances. No deals for ""a little bit of justice"", they need to be put down at all costs, lest the innocent suffer.

Shelton did this by becoming a heinous criminal. Starting off by just killing his family's murderers and steadily escalating to eventually killing totally innocent people, Shelton was asking Rice, through his actions, of where he will draw the line?

Shelton left a trail for Rice (and his collegues) to find, so that when the time came there would be a(n intentional) ""hole"" in his plan for Rice to exploit. Think about it; Shelton is a ""brain"". The guy who thinks literally 1,000 steps ahead and plans for every contingency. A man who can topple governments. Do you honestly think he didn't factor in Rice finding his bomb and moving it?

That last scene where the bomb goes off and the fire is spreading through the prison, Shelton smiles. It isn't a ""dang, he foiled me!"" smile, it's a ""He's finally learned what needs to be done"" smile. It's a smile of success because he knows Rice will now never give the truly evil any chances. Remember; Shelton's family is dead. He has nothing left to live for. He wanted to die, but he didn't want his death to be meaningless. By showing this one lawyer never to give an inch to men like him, he has possibly saved another man's family from injustice.

**TL;DR:** Shelton wasn't trying to dismantle the system, he was trying to show Rice that there are some criminals who should never be negotiated with, who should be killed at all costs, by becoming said criminal. He wanted Rice to find the bomb and kill him."

Dread sank into Kieran‚Äôs chest; his heart was pounding like a blacksmith‚Äôs hammer to an anvil. His gaze darted to a smaller puddle a few feet away and then to another slightly farther. A loud clang from somewhere inside Arwil‚Äôs study stole his attention and he recoiled.

*Gods dammit where is Arwil? Where is Voss?* Kieran crept into the tower chambers through the opened wooden door and into the hallway to Arwil‚Äôs study. There was no sign of the old man, and this type of behavior was very unlike a magus of the consortium. From here, Kieran could make out a large distorted shadow cast onto the wall of the study by one of the several lit fire globes Arwil kept near his desk. The figure‚Äôs shadow frantically rummaged through the magus‚Äôs drawers, books, and scrolls, scattering them across the floor into a disheveled mess.

Kieran edged against the wall, avoiding pieces of broken glass and furniture that had been strewn across the floor.  The ancient tapestry that had adorned the hallway wall had been ripped and torn from its anchors and lay in a heap just before the door. As Kieran approached he noticed a glimmer of firelight from something reflective on the ground; a bright red jeweled ring that the magus had always worn on his right hand. *Oh no‚Ä¶*Kieran thought as he approached the still arm that protruded from the tapestry. He knelt shaking and lifted the cloth to reveal what was underneath. Kieran‚Äôs eyes met the Magus Arwil‚Äôs, the old man‚Äôs face locked in a terrified gaze. Arwil‚Äôs mouth was agape, as if screaming in pain; his eyes opened wide.

As soon as he could see the horror of his master‚Äôs visage, Kieran gasped and stuttered backwards, abruptly stopped by the wall with tears now streaming down his quivering cheeks.  He quickly brought his hand to his mouth to stifle the outburst, briefly forgetting the unknown figure and his shadow in the room ahead. The rummaging stopped.

The shadow remained still for a moment, and then began to shrink as its owner began slowly walking toward the door. Kieran had been noticed. He was sure to suffer the same fate as Arwil, petrified to his last breath. Panic consumed Kieran, his heart beating fire into his veins. Without much consideration for further concealment he fled as quickly as he could for the spiral steps where he would go back down to the markets. *Voss where are you?* If only she were here they could fight, she was so good at everything there had to be something up her sleeve! But she wasn‚Äôt here and Kieran didn‚Äôt have the time to try and find where she was hiding.

Kieran could make it to the watchmen near the tower, tell them what happened and they would save him. He‚Äôd been down the stairs a thousand times, he could do it faster than Voss or Arwil; he was going to make it. Tears streaming down his face, Kieran burst out of chambers doors and back onto the precipice, splintering the wood as he barreled through. He could see the glyph door open for his escape, but there was something behind him. He leapt towards the door, but stopped abruptly as something forcefully tugged at the back of his shirt.

Kieran clamored backwards, hitting the back of his head on the hard stone, disorienting him and freeing his dagger. In seconds, a hooded man stood over him a few inches away. The figure reached down with his black leather-bound hand and savagely gripped Kieran‚Äôs throat.

Kieran kicked and thrashed but the grip was impossibly strong, suffocating him with every effort. The figure hauled Kieran off the ground with his extended arm and held him aloft as he struggled for air. Kieran was fighting with every fiber of his being but the arm was like stone. Through his swollen, tear-filled eyes he could see the shape of the hooded man. He was frighteningly muscular and his heavily ink-inscribed arms were bare. He wore a very ornate black hood with crimson and gold trim that glistened in the blue torchlight. His cuirass was layered with tattered black and crimson cloth, adorned with similar golden trim. Under his hood however, there didn‚Äôt seem to be anything at all. Kieran immediately knew the hood wasn‚Äôt just concealing the man‚Äôs face, under there was pure darkness. There was no feature, nothing that resembled a face under that hood, just an abyss.

The hooded man pulled Kieran closer and there was little the nearly unconscious boy could do to resist. Kieran‚Äôs frantic fighting began to slow, the world becoming cloudy and distant. The man drew Kieran closer, a few inches from where a face should have been and leaned in.

*‚ÄúPlease forgive me, I wasn‚Äôt a very good student‚Ä¶please,‚Äù* Kieran thought as the he saw the man‚Äôs head approaching. He could feel the hot breath of this faceless creature as it began to whisper something into his ear.  Kieran had never heard the words that were spoken but understood every one. With every syllable that lulled like the verse in a poem in his ear, he could feel the tethers that suspended him over a great blackness were being severed one by one. Weak and dizzy, there was no fight left. Kieran‚Äôs body went limb and he could feel an ethereal force tugging at the back of his mind. *It‚Äôs almost‚Ä¶peaceful*. A coldness filled him and his vision began to tunnel inward.

Just as he began to fade, Kieran‚Äôs left palm felt as though it had been plunged into molten silver, and he convulsed as the sensation slowly crept up his arm into his chest and then his whole body. The sensation was like a waking limb, like fire and ice as it enveloped his body.

Suddenly the creature recoiled, releasing Kieran to the ground as it started to wail and fanatically claw at its hood. It contorted and clutched at its head; its howling like a white hot rod plunged into thick ice.
As the sensation passed over him, Kieran wasn‚Äôt cloudy or dizzy or disoriented any longer. He shook his head and moved to step up off the ground. Under his hand, he felt the familiar hilt of his dagger and instinctively grabbed it. He felt the icy confidence of steel in his hand once more and finally stood up.
Kieran gritted his teeth, and took a step towards his attacker, followed by another, and then another. As the faceless man wailed in front of him Kieran gripped the dagger with both hands and thrust it forward with all the renewed strength he could muster, plunging it into the abyss that was this man‚Äôs face. The wailing stopped abruptly and the muscular body that so forcefully meant to kill Kieran moments earlier went limp, collapsing on the floor.

The wind picked up again and started whipping up the various tapestries still attached to the walls of the tower. Kieran stood, breathing heavily and fell to his knees, unable to control his sobbing. He looked up from his hands at the hooded corpse and slowly approached to examine it. Again a large gust made him cover his eyes. The wind became stronger and stronger until Kieran was about to lose his footing and grabbed what remained of the chamber door and held on as papers, scrolls, and books twirled around him and into the sky.

As he clutched onto the door, the body before him began to slowly flurry away like ash in the chaotic wind. With each passing second the body dissolved into the air as a fine dust that scattered into the sky. And just as quickly as it had begun, the unnatural wind stopped and there was nothing left of the body. Kieran stared at where it had fallen, perplexed by the lack of blood or residue of any kind. His head was pounding and he was starting to notice what a thrashing he had just received. His hands were quivering still and he brought them to his eyes only to remember the blood on his fingers. *Oh no, Voss!*

He leapt up and ran back to the stone door to the spiral stairs, looking for the trail of blood. First there were several, and then several bloody footprints smeared on the stone that ran the perimeter of the precipice. The railing over the edge was dotted with bloody handprints that corresponded with the labored stride. Finally, at the opposite end of the precipice, he could see a person leaning against the inner wall beneath the stone stairs to Kieran and Voss‚Äôs quarters on the second level. It was unmistakably Voss.

Kieran sprinted to her side but when he reached her, she lay still and pale against the stones, the wind in her hair. ‚ÄúOh gods please I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù Kieran sobbed as he clutched at her lifeless body. *If only I hadn‚Äôt stayed in the market this wouldn‚Äôt have happened, we could have done something about that‚Ä¶ that thing.* A few moments later he sat up and wiped his face to look over her body.
With one hand she clutched at a deep wound at her side with most of her clothing soaked through in blood. She had torn her sleeve to try and stop the bleeding, but it was too great a torrent for such makeshift work. Kieran opened her satchel and pulled out the black scroll she had taken with such urgency back up the tower. It had been opened and examined; the waxy seal had been delicately lifted as to not tear it. To Kieran, not a symbol on the thing made any sense. He couldn‚Äôt decipher a single letter, nevertheless a language of origin. He folded it and put it in his pocket.

To Voss‚Äôs right there was a small circle with several symbols around a central glyph, scrawled in blood onto the stone floor. Kieran had not yet even studied most of the magics and could not make out what she had made with her own blood.  He then recognized the central glyph in the inscription and quickly turned his hand to look at his left palm. Surely enough, Voss had drawn his unique glyph in her own blood with her last few moments alive. With that realization it became clear what he was looking at; it was a life ward.
She hadn‚Äôt bled out sitting here against the stones; instead she had used every ounce of life she had left to make a ward with her own life for Kieran. Voss knew he stood no chance against whatever demon or creature had come to the tower and so she made sure he wouldn‚Äôt die if he were to come back home to face the thing.

Kieran stared at Voss‚Äôs lifeless eyes and recalled how hard on him she‚Äôd been, hard and mean at times. But in those times he remembered that she was always looking out for him or trying to show him the maths and history and languages he couldn‚Äôt learn on his own.  *She always knew what to do* he thought.

As Kieran sat contemplating the sacrifice Voss had made, he heard the well-known trumpeting call of the city watch summons. *They must have heard the noise.* With the watch coming, what was he going to tell them? A mysterious hooded sonofabitch killed my master and my best friend before turning into dust after I somehow survived the ordeal? No, Kieran wasn‚Äôt even sure he believed it. Without the body, there was no evidence for what had transpired. The watch had always been superstitious around the Magus and his apprentices, they wouldn‚Äôt understand and they wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to mark Kieran a mad criminal once they put the pieces together. Kieran was running out of time.

A cell in a dank dungeon didn‚Äôt sound like much of an option, so there was but one thing he could do. *I‚Äôve got to run.* With that, he picked his dagger off the ground and stood up, sheathing it behind his back. The storage room with most of the clothing and supplies was usually well stocked and Kieran would need a fresh set of cloths and some packs. He didn‚Äôt know where he would go but he couldn‚Äôt stay here, that was for certain. The black scroll was perhaps his only lead and he‚Äôd need someone to help him understand what had happened.

The spiral steps were as they always were, flickering in blue torchlight and echoing Kieran‚Äôs quickened footfalls as he hurried down the tower. There was something else this time though, something that was just beneath the surface of Kieran‚Äôs perception. It was a whisper in words he didn‚Äôt know but somehow understood as it danced in verse at the back of his mind. He could feel the tethers that suspended him one again over that great blackness, but those words that could cut them were now his to speak. Kieran could almost place what he was thinking about; it was a sentence perhaps, something he had heard in a different life or maybe in a dream. It seemed important and he was sure he‚Äôd remember it, it was on the tip of his tongue."

Just keep at it and spend the gold on it once you get it. If you're really desperate to have it, look at some older crafting materials (herbs and ore especially) and farm those.

Just remember - gold gets easier to make the higher level you are (at least IMO) so I would HIGHLY recommend spending the time leveling and worry about the gold later instead of stopping leveling to farm for 280% flying...

However, this in no way means that an MMA fighter/person can't recognise that sometimes the ground isn't the best option. 
I often feel that TMA/RBSD people often make comments on MMA based on perceptions or third-hand experiences that are wholly untrue, whereas  MMA folks actually have a bit more experience in TMA's/RBSD systems. Our MMA gym has two 3rd degree TKD blackbelts, a JJJ blackbelt, and lots of people who used to do Krav-type stuff. It almost always is the case that MMA and its little cousin BJJ are the final place for martial artists.

jordanFromJersey,Marvel,1390999625.0,"Like you, I absolutely adored the Hickman run on F4/FF, so I was skeptical as I moved into the Fraction run. 

I was particularly worried about his FF since(from previews) it didn't appear that it was about the kids anymore, and that was my favorite part of Hickman's run. 

So it was a pleasant surprise to find out that not only were the kids heavily featured in Fraction's FF, but that he also had a great grasp on their individual voices. 

All in all, FF was consistently a delight to behold on both the art and writing fronts. 

However...

While I didn't expect Hickman level epic-ness, characterization, or intricacy from Fraction's F4, I also did not expect the bland, boring, and mostly pointless book we got. 

Don't get me wrong, the first and last issues of Fraction's F4 were pretty good, and there were a handful of interesting moments in the 14 issues in between, but the book as a whole was a major disappointment. 

In summation: Fraction's F4/FF run was not what I expected at all... for better AND for worse...

Avistew,sex,1390999932.0,"He looks at other women and find them attractive because being in love with you does not turn off people's senses. That does not mean he loves you less, or finds you less attractive, or that he'd want a relationship with any of the other girls/women he likes.

Think about movies or books you've seen or read. Have you never thought a guy was cute, dreamy, romantic, etc? That doesn't mean you don't love your boyfriend, just that hey, this guy in this story is hot, too.

The only relationships I know of where neither partner finds anyone else attractive are relationships between asexual people, who don't experience sexual attraction.

He's right to say he can't control it: it's like asking him to stop thinking his favourite food tastes good, or to stop enjoying the smell of food cooked by someone who isn't you.

He can control his action, and if it makes you insecure that he tells you about who he finds hot or sexy, then you could ask him not to tell you. Just be aware that it's not going to turn off his thoughts.

Take a deep breath and remember that he's chosen to be with you, and not with any of these other women you mention. He has a sex drive and that sex drive will be triggered by other people. That's normal. But you're the one he wants a relationship with, because you're the one he loves (on top of finding you attractive).

He doesn't seem to be very understanding, and that's a shame, but the truth is, there probably isn't much he could say or do to make you feel less insecure. Unless he's actually neglecting you, that is. Yes, he should be there for you, hug you, kiss you, say he loves you and that you're beautiful. But expecting him to stop looking at other people is unrealistic, I'm afraid.

Try and plan a date together for him to make you feel really special. Tell him you've been feeling down and you want to feel beautiful and loved. Maybe that will help."

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1391000859.0,"Your modular arithmetic is not working. If you have pi mod (2pi) = -pi mod (2pi) = pi.

Let rays m and n have common vertex A, and let rays r and s have common vertex B, such that they form right angles.

We may assume that mAn measures pi/2 (if it measures -pi/2, then flip the labels of m and n). Similarly, we may assume that rBs measures pi/2.

But if two angles have the same measure, then they are congruent.

More formally, let line c connect A and B. (Axiom 2).

Translate the angle rBs along c (or lines parallel to c) to r'b's' so that B' coincides with A. (Axiom 1).

Rotate the angle r'B's' about B' to r""B""s"" so that r"" coincides with m (Axiom 3).

Then since r"" coincides with m, B"" coincides with A, and the measure of both angles is the same (pi/2), then s"" coincides with n (Axiom 3), and the angles are identical, implying the original angles were congruent."

&gt;Step 1: Drive slow. Marked 55? better go 30, tops.

No, just no this will cause accidents.  5 under or 10 under if the conditions are terrible.  You should only be driving 25 under if it is a blizzard and or complete ice with no traction.  Driving that slow will cause people behind you to hit there breaks and or possibly swerve even more so if visibility is not that great and or your driving 20 mph under.  I hate changing lanes in icy conditions just because someone is trying to cause accidents.

&gt;Step 2: Drive as close to center lane as possible. When the snow obscures the lines fuck the rules. You're minimizing the risk of being in ditch country, damn it.

NO!  Causing a head on collision because you can't drive is a terrible idea.

Or - having been in similar situations to yours, this is what I'd think it was - you've just transferred all your desire for intimacy onto this new girl. When you're scared of being alone or not having anybody for trust, a lot of people latch onto the next opportunity they have and immediately feel very intensely towards someone that they barely know, hence the worrying that her lack of prompt texting means she's not interested and you'll be 'dumped' (for lack of a better word) again. It's not a bad thing; it's human. But if you think this might be what's happening, you need to take a step back and set boundaries to stop yourself.

These accidents are cause by people panicking and driving way to slow to handle a hill.  Hence you see a bunch of cars swerving to avoid it.  This can also be caused by an asshole driving in the center of the road.

Blindocide,DebateReligion,1391002243.0,"None of this has anything to do with what I've been talking about. You were the first one, I want to point out, to bring up Hawking in this discussion, and I merely agreed with you because of this quote from Hawking: """"If the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be.""

Which I got from [this page](http://www.ipod.org.uk/reality/reality_block_universe.asp).

I do not know how the HH model interacts with B-Theory, or how B-theory interacts with any of the competing models. I'm not sure it matters, here.

But what I do know is that: there is no objective thing known as the present from our current understanding of physics. (not conjecture, understanding)

from this, B theory is what accurately models our understanding of time.

If B-Theory is true, and it certainly is more likely than A-Theory and its undefined metaphysical creation/annihilation interactions, then there is no ""present"" or ""future"" or ""past"" or ""beginning"" or ""end"" as we understand them.

And that's simply that. I've explained myself enough times."

mczbot,soccer,1391002802.0,"I'm not sure how often i had to write the exact same comment pretty much again, but this transfer is HIGHLY unlikely to happen in the winter.

Noone really wins:

- We would be out of our only left winger
- Julian's chances to make the WC squad would be highly reduced
- Despite ""Media Reports"" Arsenal would have to overpay massively
- Julian is still injured and not allowed to play CL for Arsenal

I'm especially not trusting of these kind of media reports that suggest that both T√∂nnies or Heldt are suicidal enough to let Julian go for less then the release clausel just 1/2 year after his so celebrated contract extension.
Schalke is a very emotional club, and our fanbase can get very worked up and probably even mental. If Julian would be a player at another club, or just a normal player here on schalke, noone within the supporter ranks would give it a second thought selling him for the money Arsenal offers. We would probably even celebrate that someone really would pay that amount of money for a highly talented and gifted, yet right now very mediocre player.
But he isn't. Julian is a homegrown player and despite Meyer's suprisingly quick rise still the face and indification figure for the ""new Schalke"". He is a beacon of hope for us fans, so to speak. Both on the pitch aswell as regarding a future transfer. If he were to transfer for the release clausel, we loose a lionsshare of our debts instantly.
However, we are not in a position were we have the need to sell him. Especially for less then what we can get for him with the release clausel. And the supporters know that. Letting Julian go right now will cause enourmous pressure on our management and i would actually say that they wouldnt recover from it - unless with resignations that is."

oi_rohe,changemyview,1391003114.0,"I would say that you are wrong when you claim an armless person is 'less human'.  Humanity isn't measured by physical prowess but by mental abilities, most relevantly demonstrated by Steven Hawking.  He's a genius, he's furthered humanity's scientific endeavour by a huge amount, and he's totally incapable of taking care of himself.  Physical disability is no reason to consider a person to be less.

Mental disability could be considered to reduce a person's humanity, but in my opinion any amount of suffering is better than not existing so it's no reason to abort them either, assuming they can be taken care of beyond some base level.

I also take issue with your claim that the existence of disabled people is degrading to 'normal' people.  The existence of a chihuahua isn't an insult to saint bernards, but they're both dogs.  Dogs with drastically different abilities, but both appreciable and desirable to some people.  It translates to people too.

EDIT: Your view can also be simplified (poorly, but when has that stopped political movements?) to 'let's kill these people I don't like'.  That's really fucking dangerous.  Don't go there, WWII wasn't fun.

but seriously. ~~what sort of bike do you have?~~

NM, i looked through your comments and found it.

[Virago 250](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_XV250)

Although you do seem to be skirting the idea of buying some sort of HD. 

FYI:

HD 883: 53 HP @ 6000 RPM, 48.5 FT LBS Torque @ 4100 RPM 

Virago: 23 hp @ 8000 rpm, 15 ft lbs torque @ 6000 rpm

Yes, the numbers are better, but the HD would ""run out of steam"" sooner, which is the ultimate issue with getting them running fast on the interstate. 

I think what people are saying when they say ""it's not much of an upgrade"" isn't commenting on the difference between the bikes, but more a comment referring to your development as a rider.

For japanese sportish road bikes (my experience on HD and cruisers is limited): A 250 bike is great to start on, and jumping up to a 500, the 500 seems like a HUGE upgrade, which it is comparatively. But imo, what they are trying to say is that you will be past the 500 soon enough because of your riding skill development curve, which starts to ramp up more rapidly after you get past the first thousand miles of mixed riding and have a few close calls, maybe a spill.

Once you reach plateau phase in your development you will yearn for a bigger, more challenging bike. This is why they say ""it's not too much of an upgrade"". Your skills are gonna be upgrading faster than you going from a 250 to a 500/883. That's why i suggest stepping up a bit more. 

IMO, you should get a bolt or a t100. if it's got to be a HD, get an older 1200. but to each his own. btw, a lot of us older riders yearn for the good old days you are currently in. back when it was all so new, exciting and stimulating. *le sigh*

If it was a cold day and I had to run the heater, I would watch the meter go down-- and have to plug in at work or I wouldn't make it back home at the end of the day.

Thornnuminous,changemyview,1391004765.0,"&gt; My reason for not dating a woman who has had an abortion is simply because a woman who has had one, is already more likely to have another than a woman who hasn't.

Based on what? Each woman is an individual, and her reasons are never going to be exactly like someone else's.

You are cutting yourself off from many potentially wonderful people by this arbitrary point.

For example, what if she was 16 and knew she couldn't handle it, but wants to be a mother later in life, and chose to abort rather than ruin her ability to gain an education that would allow her to get a job and make her a *far better* parent; one who is stable, emotionally, professionally and financially?

By prejudging a woman who has had an abortion, you are defining her by one moment in time, and not taking into consideration the context of that decision, who she was then, and who she is now.

yanarchy,singapore,1391005994.0,"Mm, I think in regards to Singaporeans with Chinese-Chinese spouses, it's normal? As in, it's no more significant than couples in other countries with a multicultural demographic. Also, given the close proximity of Singapore to China, the exchange of workers, and the fact that most Singaporeans claim ancestry from China, doesn't seem like it's a huge stretch nor anything particularly notable.

Also, with regards to ""ang-mohs"" getting more attention from women, I think it just gets exaggerated because of the visibility of the expat scene--it attracts particular people and you see it more because the expat-heavy areas are the central areas. Also, interracial couples stand out much more and in my observation, Singaporeans tend to pair off fairly early (in their mid to late 20's and often after college) and drop from that nightlife scene that we see. So the group that you're left with are the ones that dominate nightlife. You should also factor in perception bias for yourself--you often see what you want to see. There may have been a see of Asian-Asian couples but the 2-3 interracial couples stand out the most and your brain zooms in on it. Everyone is guilty of this, it's natural.

If you start working now and don't drink your money away at the local bar every night, you can be a very wealthy man. 

Plus you'll probably be happier than getting some know-nothing degree from a community college or state university that shovels you right into a shitty sales job in corporate america where your soul is sucked away from you every day.

Go to work, save your money, pat yourself on the back when your college educated friends complain about their student loan debt and their shitty job that isn't even related to what they studied.

Edit: The meat from the study

&gt;Consider four equally talented 18 year- olds -- Joe, Jill, Sue, and Matt. 

&gt;Jill chooses medicine. Sue and Matt both get bachelor‚Äôs degrees in education at the same expensive college Jill attends, but Matt spends an extra two years after college getting his masters. Joe takes a pass on attending college. Instead, he decides to become a plumber.

&gt;Jill, the doctor, has the highest living standard. She gets to spend $33,666 year in and year out from age 19 through 100.

&gt;Joe the plumber‚Äôs sustainable spending is almost as high -- $33,243

&gt;Sue, the teacher? Sue has less spending power -- $27,608 -- than Joe.

&gt;Matt, with his masters? His spending power is even lower than Sue‚Äôs, at $26,503.

&gt;All those grueling years of study, exams, late-night emergency calls, and Jill gets to spend a measly $423 more per year than a plumber."

The thing that wins games in 3v3 are junglers.

I'm Gold last season in ranked 5s (Silver this season so far since I haven't played after placements due to having a horrible losing streak).  When I took a break from SoloQ my friends and I played ranked 3s and went 5-0.

I jungled and I noticed that the jungler has the highest impact on the 3v3 game. 

Top tier junglers:

* Lee Sin (ban or 1st pick, no excuses)
* Xin Zhao 
* Diana (after lvl 6)
* Jarvan IV
* Udyr

Build them bruiserish.  Warwick is good if your team can lane safe until level 6 and Volibear is good if you end up with Yasuo.  I think Shyvana and Skarner can be sneaky good, too.

Top lane:

* Yasuo (ban or pick)
* Renekton
* Tryndamere
* Wukong
* Riven

I've seen Darius do pretty well, too.

Bot lane:

* Cassiopeia
* Lulu
* Annie
* Morgana
* Syndra

Other strong champions in the game are Fizz and Ahri, but not as good as the 5 above.

There are a ton of other good champions, but generally these are really strong picks.  You obviously want to pick champions that combo well together.  The 3v3 map lends itself to what people would consider ""lane bullies"" for the solo lanes and ""counter junglers"" for the jungle, although there are exceptions.

The most important thing is for your jungler to live in their jungle.  He should never be farming his own camps, only theirs.  If you control their jungle as a group then you will win very easily. "

Blindocide,DebateReligion,1391007127.0,"Why do you keep arbitrarily defining the singularity as the starting point?

Because you experience ""later"" states that remember ""previous"" states? Because entropy? Because of the size of the universe at the time? 

These are not objective ways to distinguish ""the beginning"". What you're noting is a peculiar arrangement of matter and energy.

&gt; ""This point in time has remarkably low entropy!"", you say

""ok, and?"" I say.

&gt; ""Therefore it's the first point!"" you say

""That's a non sequitor"", I say.

Because it is. There is literally nothing about the singularity that tells us anything more about the universe than any other point in time. The singularity isn't special just because it's the singularity and things get all wonky. Heat Death gets pretty wonky, too, but I wouldn't call it ""the end"" either.

Ok, I think this bears elucidating.

The B-Theorist (me, not you, so shut up and listen) knows that you can use spatial references to explain the spatial relationship between two objects. These are words like ""left"", ""right"", ""up"" and ""down"". However, there is no such thing as an objective ""the left"" or ""the right"". Do you disagree?

Of course you don't disagree that there is no objective ""left"". If you disagreed with that, you'd be an idiot.

But we can say ""the can is to the left of the kettle"" because it's ""to the left of"" another object. That's how directions work. No objective North but we can draw a map and use GPS coordinates perfectly fine.

Ok. So the B-Theorist (me still, not you still, please listen still) also knows that you can use temporal references to explain the temporal relationship between any two points in time.

""two days ago"" refers to a point in time that is two days prior to the time it was said. There is no objective ""two days ago"". There is no objective ""tomorrow"", because every day is tomorrow. Every day is also yesterday.

You with me, still?

Cool. 

Now, what you'll say is:

&gt; ""Blindocide, it's so simple! There is no objective ""one second ago"", but we can look back until there isn't a ""one second ago"". That's the first second!""

***Please pay attention to this***.

Entropy is asymmetrical with the time axis, whereas physical laws are not. For whatever reason, one state of the universe has remarkably low entropy and another state has remarkably high entropy and there's a bunch of states in the middle that have ever-increasing (or ever-decreasing) levels of entropy.

Ok.

Entropy has been directly tied to the information content of a system. This is fact. As entropy increases, information increases. I like to think of this as a sort of ""quantum memory"", where all the information of the physical interactions that happened ""before"" are accumulated. 

In reality, most entropy is just heat which doesn't really give us much information, but shhhh.

Memory, like your human memory, is the byproduct of the physical system of your brain. As entropy of that system increases, so does the information that system contains. And lo! You are always gaining more information over time, visual information, auditory information, etc. etc. and this is being processed into your memory.

And since we do not feel the passage of time, we only remember ""previous states"", this is nothing but a byproduct of the curious phenomenon of a low entropy state. ***So when you say we're looking at ""one second ago"", you're really saying ""one second in the direction of lower entropy"", that's not ""ago"" objectively. That's just what we experience because of how our brain (a physical system) accumulates information***

There's a lot of words here so I guarantee you're just gonna skip most of it, but whatever."

&gt; Personally i think it is a form of welfare for the wealthy. Devaluing the dollar and slowing down the economic recovery in the process.

Those are the effects, but weren't the intent.  The intent was to force and keep Treasury Security rates low.  When those rates go back up to historical average levels, we're going to be on the hook for trillion dollar interest payments within 3 years, more over time even if the debt doesn't go higher - and of course more as the debt goes higher.

Given that our revenues are only $2.5 trillion, we can't make those kinds of payments."

For us he would likely be coming off the bench so we would spend 19.45 of his 20 on the pitch wondering why the hell he was walking around and .15 hoping he gave us a moment of brilliance.

Even the most ardent Ade supporters will tell you that there are games where he can disappear. Berba on a bad day is 10x worse than Ade on a bad day. He is completely missing from the pitch.

We look like we are going to have nothing short of a knock down drag out fight for 4th over the remainder of the season.

Kevin has beef with him (plus a lot of people got pissed about his Hollywood Babble-On appearance) so Smodco is out. The only large network I can see where the majority fanbase wouldn't potentially be biased against Adam is Deathsquad.

I think what will end up happening is that Adam will do the kickstarter or whatever and make the rounds on other pods but I don't see them being active participants since it's not yet their battle. I don't know if I even agree it ever will be. Personal audio successfully sued Apple, if there aim is to build on that why didn't they sue Stitcher and then libsyn, etc.? Why did they jump to content producers? I really don't know but following that logic they may just sue Carolla and Stuff You Should Know and then move on to another angle."

As for more skill, all sp in eve does is provide you with different options. Some of the low skill ships can be incredibly dangerous in the right hands

You don't understand.  Money and time can put you ahead of someone with a few friends and skill.  And if that person with money and time has friends as they do from playing the game they will have an advantage.

Trying to say skill is worth more than money and time in in eve is ridiculous the game is all about money and time.


EVE would be straight pay to win if it was not for the amount of time required to skill up.  Entire wars can be won by throwing numbers at other armies.  Lose a ship fuck it buy another one.  Someone with no bottom to his bank and no life would have an extreme advantage over someone with similar time constraints and no extra cash to burn."

Most of the studies which are currently available are limited to observation of the development of children based on self-reported use during pregnancy.  It doesn't inspire a lot of confidence for me, particularly with smaller sample size.  I think the study in Jamaica is the one I see come up most often. 

My experience makes me leery, I know a kid who's mother smoked pot heavily while pregnant, and he struggles with developmental delays and has asthma.  Neither of which are necessarily *known* to be caused by pot, but according to his doctors it is generally believed to be associated.  I'm not one to judge from anecdotal evidence, but it does make me worry when there just isn't enough good science out there to come to any definitive conclusions.

It's really unfortunate that marijuana is becoming more accepted and commonly used as an anti-emetic when there is so little data available about the effects.  Pregnant women, and especially those who are really ill, are vulnerable enough without having to accept that they shouldn't use a medication that they know will help... but there is no science actually telling them why they shouldn't use it.  That's just not fair.  Hopefully this will help.  Shameless plug: Diclegis is now available in the US and it's category A, explore other options before you get desperate!

That this is a place for intelligent discussion, or in fact any discussion at all really. Anyone who spends more than 5 minutes here will learn that that is not the case.

Reddit embarrassed itself time and time again with witchhunts, the rape thread fiasco, boston bombing and we all know the rest. The more time goes on the more people will see reddit for what it is and leave, the content has already degraded too much. 

This is not something that will reverse itself as reddit by design makes people fit into what's popular right now due to the karma system. Mindless memes, puns, jokes, recycled content cycles over and over. The site is now too big to stop it, the attention you can receive for doing that is too great.

You got to remember that what you are saying is that people get things for free no matter what job they have right? So lets say a cleaner will get the same benefits as a CEO of a big company. How would that be fair? The CEO is obviouslly working harder and is more skilled thatn the cleaner but is getting the same benefits as they do.

gingerkid1234,Judaism,1391010039.0,"&gt;Your statement would mean that you know of at least one example of an Orthodox beit din asking a Conservative convert, ""did you study, go before a beit din, get snipped and get dunked?"" with no follow up questions asked about the details of any of those rituals, and upon hearing four yeses, the Orthodox BD accepting the convert's geirus as valid.

Not necessarily.  The Orthodox would also ask about the witnesses.  If they were male and observant (family purity/Shabbat observant/Kashrut observant), they might accept it.  It's unusual, but possible.

I don't know of any examples of it, sure.  But the issues aren't with it being Conservative itself, just that Conservative conversions tend have issues that Orthodoxy generally thinks matter even after-the-fact.  But the issues are with consequences of Conservative halakhah, not with the fact that the BD isn't Orthodox.  Hell, without a standard definition of ""orthodox"" there's no way of effectively saying what an Orthodox BD is that doesn't also include some Conservative ones!"

vehementvelociraptor,AskReddit,1391010090.0,"It's hard to explain to someone who hasn't grown up around guns, you would need context to understand...  Plus there are *HUGE* differences between our cultures.  This explanation is going to ramble a bit, and for that I apologize.  (it's also 0745 here, higher brain functions haven't kicked in yet)

Think of it like this.  Guns are very ingrained in American culture, whether for good or bad.  We've had a right to own them for ~230 years here, again, just a fact, good or bad.  Being that they've been widely available, people own them, a LOT of them.  They're easy to obtain here, legally or illegally, sadly.

Please see this [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1wdd04/whats_something_most_people_are_scared_ofweirded/cf1i3lv) I made in reply to /u/KingKongsBong, it does a good job of explaining the patriotic ""Murica &amp; guns 'n shit!"" sentiment in a more... reasonable and tangible (read: less redneck) approach.

You're up north, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, etc.  Your people don't have this experience.  There are also other consideration, such as in the US, the majority of gun homicides are gang related or suicides.  Unfortunate, but that's our culture.  Northern europe has taken awesome strides to combat their social problems, and your economic successes are enviable.  If America had your culture and our current gun ownership, I guarantee you that gun violence would still be an issue, but it would be significantly less.  

Also read that comment I linked in reference to handgun violence vs *all other guns*.  The gist of it is, that all guns that are not handguns: rifles, AKs, ARs, 'sniper rifles', high caliber guns, shotguns, etc.  ALL of them combined account for less fatalities here than knives.  And that's what people want to ban.  nobody is talking here about banning handguns, but they focus so hard on AR rifles, which account for &lt;1% of firearm deaths here in the states.

What we gun owners hate around here is the proposed legislation and mindset of the anti-gunners.  Most of us will reasonably admit that gun violence is a problem, but all of the proposed legislation will do virtually nothing to curtail that.  Legislation does these things:

- Makes it difficult to legally purchase a firearm, while doing nothing to combat illegal purchases of firearms.  **AND THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE CRIMES HAPPEN**  Think about it, they're only taking away the guns from the people that *won't* murder someone with them.

- Looks to ban weapons that aren't even marginally part of the problem.  It's so easy to point to a military 'looking' rifle and say it should be banned, but in reality they're the smallest problem we have.

- Shoes a staggering ignorance about modern firearms.  Lots of examples in this thread, take a read.

So, I know this was rambling so let me **TL;DR**:  Pro-gun advocates admit gun violence is a problem.  Proposed legislation does not even remotely come close to curtailing that, if anything it only puts law abiding consumers at a disadvantage while doing nothing to address the illegal obtaining of a firearm.  Guns have been around us forever, we like them for the sport, and if you want to take away our passion for no good reason (read: ineffectual legislation) we're going to be pissed.

honestly that comment I linked does a better job of explaining all this.  I'll end it the same way:

&gt; So listen man, I don't think I've swung you to the pro-gun side, and that wasn't my intent. But hopefully you have gained an insight into our thought processes. If you still disagree with me, that's awesome and I'm glad that you can stand up for what you want. But now I think you have a better idea on how to frame your opinions, with regard to ours."

newer automatic transmissions have paddles that are right by the steering wheel that you can grab to choose which gear you'd like to be in, giving you more control like a manual transmission.  manual mode is the same thing, but instead of having the paddles to shift, you use the actual stick to choose which gear you want to be in.  manumatic is another word for the manual mode.  very few transmissions these days are like the old slush boxes where you had drive, 2, 1 and could only select to stay in first gear, or first and second, or full automatic.  you have a lot more control over the gears, and shifts are generally much faster.

sorry to see the ranks of manual drivers falling by 1, but take care of yourself.

edit:
see [those silver bars](http://media.caranddriver.com/images/media/52267/2008-mitsubishi-lancer-evolution-mr-steering-wheel-and-paddle-shifters-photo-53215-s-1280x782.jpg) right behind the steering wheel?  those are the paddles.  sometimes they're built right in to the back of the steering wheel, sometimes they're like that.

and i forgot to add, all of these are options, you can certainly stick the car in drive and it'll go just like a regular automatic, but if you're in ice or snow and want to control the power delivery, you can choose to go in to paddle or stick shifting mode and control the car like you would a manual, just without a clutch pedal and actually having to row the gears."

thunderburd,FeMRADebates,1391011140.0,"&gt; I feel like all you did here was admit that you believe a bunch of rape myths.

I feel like all he/she did here was show that those specific questions are poorly worded at best and utterly dishonest at worst.

Specifically, I also take issue with the following two questions:

&gt; If a girl initiates kissing or hooking up, she should not be surprised if a guy assumes she wants to have sex.

I have quite often assumed a girl kissing/making out with me wanted sex.  That assumption was usually pretty accurate.  And in the cases where it WASN'T accurate it certainly didn't lead to rape.  An assumption can be followed by questions that confirm or deny that assumption.  You know, something like ""want to come back to my place?"" or ""How far do you want to take this?""

And hell, all the girls who *I've* kissed pretty much assumed I wanted sex, too.  Very few took the assumption too far.  Most confirmed their assumption verbally.  The assumption itself is not *bad*.

&gt; Girls who are caught cheating on their boyfriends sometimes claim it was rape.

If this said ""ALL girls who are caught..."" I would agree that it would be a myth.  But the statement as is is PROVABLY TRUE.  There are documented cases with evidence where this has happened.  So believing in something that DOES provably occur != believing in a rape myth.  It just means that calling this a ""myth"" at all is a flat out lie."

&gt; The whole ""NFL is a non-profit"" complaining is kind of bullshit and extremely misleading. ""The NFL"" that's being referenced is simply the head office of the NFL. This is separate from every team, and their job is to make the league rules, negotiate with the union, and negotiate contracts with sponsors and media. It's organized as a non-profit because it actually makes no profit. All profits that are made by ""The NFL"" are passed on to the individual teams and taxes are payed at the team level. So to answer that question, it's because it wouldn't really matter. If they reclassified as a for-profit organization they still wouldn't pay any taxes since they make no profit."

It is fair to tell someone you want to be in a relationship with that you want children, and if they don't, to move on to find someone who does.

Or maybe you're not.

The bottom line is you're a 33 year old virgin who just got dumped by someone he really liked and you're unhappy. Your life choices are making you unhappy.

It is time to reexamine what they all mean and if they really are working for you or not. Putting cherished beliefs under a microscope is scary, I get that. Questioning things you've based your life on is scary. I completely understand.

What if you decide you have been wrong? What does that mean for who you are and how your life has been led? 

The question is, are you brave enough to sort through these values and give them serious scrutiny, and face the potential truth that you have been mistaken? Or if you were not mistaken originally, the values that are hampering you now have outlived their useful life?

Nothing is forever. Nothing is set in stone.

The important thing here is to decide what it is you need to be content and happy and at peace with yourself. 

Don't let fear of failure, fear of truth, fear of learning things you have tried to avoid learning stop you from living your life.

Mid game: Hood is ok to make you tankier, but it doesn't change the spell's HP cost, and you are probably not going to get enough farm to make a shiva's by mid game.

But think of your future self rather than your present self: will she be happy hearing about how your ex has moved on? About how your ex has fallen in love with someone else and gushing about how wonderful it is to you? Being friends with someone when you want more and they don't? I'm guessing she won't be.

Maybe you're right about the reason she chose not to be friends. But doesn't that say something? She knew you guys wouldn't work as friends, so she hasn't made an effort to be friends. 

One day you'll move on, but if you're cultivating a friendship with the ex in the hopes (deep down or not) of getting back together, it'll take a very long time for you to move on and probably a lot of heartbreak on your part. My advice would be to not think about friendship with her now. Remember why you broke up. Focus on the future rather than the past. Maybe one day you can be friends again, but not while you have feelings for her still and that will probably take years."

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1391012592.0,"&gt;I've always looked out for her best interests, and I feel torn here. Should I go for it, or keep hanging back and encouraging her to break up with him? Or just tell him?

She has a boyfriend and she's hitting on you. Does that sound like she's worth your time? Because if she's doing this to him, what makes you think she won't do it to her? Even if she breaks up with him, her behaviour is showing you what kind of girlfriend you can expect her to be. If her solution to dating the wrong man is to cheat on him instead of doing the adult thing and ending it so she can be with someone else, she's not girlfriend material! She's too immature and/or selfish to be in any kind of lasting relationship...it would be a waste of time.

If you go for it, you will be pretty much as crappy as she is - you know she's taken, you know it's wrong, and if you do it anyway. I hope you are better than that, because it's a selfish and dishonourable thing to do. The fact that you've had the hots for her since high school is totally irrelevant. It would still be a lousy thing for you to do. 

If you hang back and wait and she breaks up with him, you're going to be dating a woman who pursues other men while dating, and that's not going to be a lasting, happy relationship, now is it?

If you tell him, one of two things will happen: he gets angry and assumes you're lying and there's a big fight; or he believes you, dumps her, and then you may lose her friendship because she will blame you for the demise of the relationship even though *she* is to blame. 

If it was you, and your girlfriend was hitting hard on another man behind your back, what would you want him to do? Bang her, because he's wanted her for so long and feels like he doesn't owe you anything? Encourage her to ditch you so they could be together? Tell you, so you could cut the cheater free and find a woman you can trust? Whatever you would want another man to do in your situation, with *your* girlfriend, that's what you should do. Personally I'd go with telling him...he deserves to know the truth and there's probably no way she'd ever tell him."

keypuncher,askaconservative,1391012959.0,"&gt; She is socially liberal, but understands that economics and money managements are things that can't be described with simple labels such as conservative and liberal.

It is pretty rare for liberals to be that open minded.  Your cousin is a lucky guy.

&gt; Her major concerns are that even if we manage to cut enough spending to eliminate yearly deficits and even move into surplus is that the interest payments are going to break the budget.

This, exactly.  We're paying around $225 billion in interest payments right now on the $17 trillion debt - but that is with a 1/10 of 1% interest rate on short term debt.  When that interest rate goes back up to the historical average of 5.7% (and it will, if not higher), we're going to get hit with $1 trillion interest payments within 3 years, as the short term debt matures and is rolled over at the new rates.  Those payments will go up as the debt continues to increase, as longer-term debt matures, and if interest rates increase further (interests on Treasury Securities went as high as 16% in the 1980s).  The only ways to deal with that interest are to increase taxes by 40%+ (on everyone), cut (current) spending by 25%, borrow the additional money, ""print"" money to pay the debt, or default - and that doesn't get us to a ""balanced"" budget - that just keeps us at the same deficit.

Of course, that kind of a tax increase would wreck the economy, requiring an even larger tax increase to get the same revenue.  

Politically, cutting spending by that much is not possible - we couldn't cut future spending increases by 1/10 of that amount without wailing about how it would be the end of everything, much less actual current spending.

Borrowing the money would add to the debt much faster, causing interest payments to exceed revenues in about 10 years, give or take.  Some time before that happened, investors would flee, forcing us into another mode.

""Printing"" money to pay the debt would put that money directly into the economy, massively increasing the money supply and causing high double or triple digit inflation.  Investors would flee, pushing us into default.

Default is the (IMO inevitable at this point) end scenario, where our money, because it is a fiat currency based solely on the belief that the government will pay its debts in something worth more than the paper it is printed on, becomes effectively worthless.

Technically this scenario is still avoidable, if draconian moves to balance the budget and begin paying down the debt are made before interest rates go back up.  In practice, I do not believe the political will to do this exists in our government.

&gt; She says and I agree with her that the only way we are going to be able to make our payments is with a combination of reforming the tax code to bring tax rates down while increasing revenue and slashing spending. 

Yep - the problem is our politicians are too used to using effectively unlimited Federal funds obtained from borrowing to buy votes via continuing payments.  Doing what is necessary would require ending that practice, and our current politicians will not.

&gt; She also says that the current debt figure is misleading.

Yes, very.  When the difference between future obligations and what we are collecting to pay for them is figured in, the official debt is low by a factor of about 10.

&gt; From the way she explained it to me (and I don't completely understand so I might be communicating this incorrectly) is that we actually owe our selves a nice chunk of money. The way to government has cooked the books over the past 20 years has caused us to owe the Social Security Fund around $4 trillion dollars...

The Federal Government collected payroll taxes to put into the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, with the idea that money in those funds would earn interest and be paid back to us later.

In practice, the government sold those funds ""non-marketable securities"" (basically IOUs) and then spent the money obtained from the sale.  The non-marketable securities earn ""interest"" that is paid for with Income Tax revenues and borrowing.

Since 2007, payments to Medicare beneficiaries have exceeded revenues.  Since 2010, payments to Social Security beneficiaries have exceeded revenues.  This is not expected to change.  When the government has to cash in those non-marketable securities to pay benefits, it has no money to do so (because it operates at a deficit) - so it must either increase income taxes or borrow more money to do so.  The Social Security Trust Fund was $2.8 trillion on paper, the Medicare Trust fund, $800 billion.

So, we gave the government our money to invest for us, and it took and spent the money, taxed us more to pay interest to ourselves on money they took and spent, and will tax us even more to pay back the money it took and spent.  Some of the money to pay back what the government took will be borrowed (which means we will have to pay interest on it also), and will have to be paid back later."

DozerandDaisy,GlobalOffensive,1391013232.0,"I'm sure somebody else can explain it better than me, but I'll give my best, layman's explanation.  Tick rate refers to how frequently a server updates the information it's taking in from each player.  Each ""tick"" is a new frame of reference based on player inputs, and the server will compute all of this incoming information to create the playing field in each new frame.  

Obviously, a server with a higher tick rate will update more frequently and therefore be a more accurate representation of the congregate player input.  The standard matchmaking servers run at 64 tick, which many players view as insufficient.  And it's true; a lot of times, a 64 tick server may create an inaccurate event based on its slower intake of information.  For this reason, many high-level players who rely primarily on split-second reactions and extraordinarily fast responses prefer services other than matchmaking, such as ESEA and altpug.  Both ESEA and altpug servers primarily run on 128 tick servers, which provide a smoother and much more accurate experience for players who have a computer that can handle the increased strain.   "

Is this very common in the US? I've heard a lot of stories on the internet about stuff like this happening (for straight men at straight clubs and girls at gay bars) but I'm glad I've never experienced it myself. The gay club I go to the most has male and female staff who serve you in order and two large, gendered bathrooms and a larger unisex one. I've heard of some clubs in London not letting people in unless they look/seem queer, but only on specific nights and that's about it.

As a lesbian, I do find it slightly frustrating when the women of the club are like 70:30 straight to queer women and I very much sympathise with this article's rebuttal; I've seen straight women behaving that way to the gay men and it must get beyond annoying. The first article just confused me, I'm glad to see one arguing against what seems to me to be obvious flaws in it."

Irrelevant, and definitely not the case nowadays or for the last century. 


&gt;My point is that it being benevolent depends on your point of view. For women it's benevolent because it's not a form of malevolent discrimination, but it's still sexist. For men it's a form of malevolent discrimination because it's putting them in danger of bodily harm - except we can't dismiss the reasons why that is.

I certainly wouldn't call men's advantages over women ""benevolent"". Qualifying another's, possibly deadly, disadvantage as ""benevolent"" because it doesn't harm you is unforgivably selfish. It equates ""morally good""
 with ""good for you, others be damned"", which is fundamentally immoral. Who says you have to be partial? Morality is about *everyone*'s well-being. 


&gt;In fact, one of the, maybe the most, elementary of moral principles is that of universality, that is, If something's right for me, it's right for you; if it's wrong for you, it's wrong for me. Any moral code that is even worth looking at has that at its core somehow. Chomsky

This is embarrassing. Go ahead and look down at your keyboard while you type. Now, turn the keyboard 180 degrees while its sitting on your desk so you're looking at it from the opposite angle.

Now, tell me, from ***YOUR PERSPECTIVE***, what side of key S is key A on? 

Hell, I'm doing it right now and A is to the right of S.

So, again, is there something called ""the left""? Can you show me, objectively, that something is to the left of something else? Or does it all depend on your perception of their relationship?

To elucidate further: you see two cars parked next to each other. From your perspective, the blue one is to the right of the red one, and vice versa. Now, walk to the other side of the cars, and what's happened? Now the blue on is on the left side of the right one, and vice versa! Is this magic? No, it's perception.

Do you think humans discovered the North pole? We labeled it the north pole. We could have called ANY POINT ON EARTH the ""north pole"" and then drawn our longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates from there. It just so happens that all the people who drew maps agreed on this one starting point. There was probably a couple wars fought over this, to get all the mapmakers to agree to it.

So, there is no ""objective"" north, something that has northlike qualities. There are just positions on the globe that we label and agree to.

Many employers are dumping employer-provided healthcare because the premium increases caused by Obamacare make it too expensive a benefit to offer.

The CBO recognized this would occur, but assumed the number affected would ""only"" be around 7 million - I suspect that in the end the number will be far higher.

&gt; Keep in mind that if an employer decides to cut peoples hours in order to make some sort of ideological statement, that's the employers decision and not something Obamacare forced on a business.

No, it is a recognition that if they have too many employees, working too many hours, the law puts very high costs on the business that it may not be able to afford.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,Parenting,1391014108.0,"I totally understand how you feel. We've had a couple experiences like that. The worst one was last spring, when my son had a serious (yet ultimately not that serious) accident. He was on a trampoline with his friends...he got bounced up very high and his face hit the metal bar when he landed. It smashed out four teeth, three of which were adult teeth, and left his gums lacerated down to the bone and his lips mangled and swollen. I wasn't there for it - my husband was. I was out of town for the evening, and by the time I got home (he phoned right after it happened so I turned around on the spot), he was already at the dentist for x-rays and stitching. 

Anyway, it was traumatic for *me* just seeing his face all smashed and bloodied. It was much worse for my husband, who had to deal with all the blood and screaming, and the terror of the other children who were around our son when it happened, including his little sister. Apparently the kids were all running around and shouting in a blind panic, and our boy was mindlessly wailing while his mouth dripped blood. Hubby said it was like a war zone for a few minutes, but he got everyone calmed down and our son to the hospital to be examined. His injuries could have been much worse; he is now short a few teeth, but his gums healed beautifully and there were no fractures of his jaw or face bones, and he had no concussion. He was alright once they sewed him up, and he enjoyed living on pudding and popsicles and jello for a week while his mouth recovered. 

But for my husband and I, the trauma lingered quite a bit. I felt the same kind of grief you did, and for a few weeks I couldn't bear to look at pics of him with teeth. I was sad and anxious and tired, and my husband was even more so. It was brutal. But you know what? It will pass. Your kid heals and you will heal too. 

You were careful; you did what you believed was enough to protect her, not knowing she'd be able to squeeze through the gap like that. So you need to stop blaming yourself. Nobody was at fault here. Sometimes things happen despite your efforts and your best intentions, and it doesn't make you a bad parent. And she's okay. She's *fine* - no damage, no real injury. It's all okay now. You're shaken up because it could have ended differently, and that's normal. It will get better. In the mean time, keep hugging your baby, and please, talk to your wife about it! You guys are partners and friends, I hope, and you need to let her help you and comfort you. Chances are good she's freaking out a bit too and it might help you both to open up. If the weather's good, take your girl out for a walk or go to the park - exercise has always helped me to put life into perspective and to clear my head, so maybe it'll help you too.

EaglesOnPogoSticks,Fitness,1391014113.0,"&gt; I'm scared of that piece of metal falling on my throat, not being able to get it off, and not having anyone around to help me. I realize this isn't an issue when I'm lifting nothing, but what happens when I eventually am lifting a significant amount? Is that a problem, is there any way to avoid that problem?

If you aren't being completely reckless about loading too much weight (which should never happen if you start with an empty bar and slowly load more each workout as beginner programs like SS and SL dictate) and you're not using the suicide grip, then this is an extremely rare type of accident. If you are eating and resting properly (read: not catastrophically bad) then there is basically no chance of you accidentally dropping 60kg if you successfully benched at 57,5kg the last workout.

[This is what happens when you fail a rep without a spotter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qohvvfv0OwA), and it really isn't any worse than that. If you're unsure whether you can complete the rep you slowly lower the bar and then you just roll it down your body. 

And that's just if you don't have a power cage. If you do have one you should be able to set it up so that the bar touches your chest when you arch your back and push out the chest, but it gets stopped by the side rails when you lie flat.

Lastly, you can often ask some random person at the gym to spot you for a set. If you're doing a beginner program like SS or SL then you should only need a spot for the last set anyway. Explain clearly when you want them to help, like once you actually say ""Help"" or once you touch the chest again without completing the full ROM.

&gt; I am also intimidated in that there is no way for me to tell if I have good form or not.

Make a video and post for a form check."

What do you mean when she ""might have cheated"" on you? Is looking at guys cheating? Is going on a date while you're on a break considered cheating? Or did she have inappropriate physical or emotional contact with another man while you two were monogamous? 

The reason I am asking is because you didn't really give us a lot of information here. Saying that you're not insecure doesn't necessarily make it true. Men I have dated have gotten upset with me for 'flirting' when I was actually just being friendly, which I am, and making silly conversation with the human beings I interact with.

rmigz,leagueoflegends,1391014536.0,"So I generally have been having success building Machete + a Doran's item for early strength champions with high sustain.  I go straight up Spirit Stone (+2 hp +1 mana pots) on champs that need the sustain for mana/hp, really only done this on Diana so far.

Machete + Doran's Blade + 2 hp pots = Lee, Udyr, Shyvana

Machete + Doran's Shield + 2 hp pots = Xin, J4, Voli

I think that I would only go double Doran's Blade on Lee or maybe if you are jungling Kha'Zix/Riven, though for Riven/Kha'Zix it's probably better to go double Longsword +3 hp pots so you can get Elder Lizard faster and have early damage.

At level 1 I will clear Wraith camp, go auto+auto+Smite Big Wolf to get fast level 2 and the HP/Speed boost in the center to meet with top lane (leave little wolves you can clear later).  The top lane should be shoving quick at this point to deny farm and meet you in the enemy jungle where you will often catch their jungler finishing wolf camp or starting big Golem camp and you can FB or deny farm/xp to both top and jungle.  At this point just sit in their jungle, farm it, and deny.  Bot should be ready to rotate fast for a fight in their jungle.

3v3 is all about forcing fights 2v1, 3v2, etc. and controlling the enemy jungle (including the altar).  Be ready to fight at their altar any time they try to reclaim it.  You also want to all 3 base at the same time, so that you aren't ever caught out as there is no ward coverage."

For the last year or so I've been doing [StitchFix](https://www.stitchfix.com) and I'm in love with it. They send clothes and accessories based on the style profile they have you fill out and your Pinterest board. Each box is $20 and you receive 5 pieces. If you end up buying anything the $20 fee for the box is applied to your check out total. If you don't keep anything, you eat the $20 but I've always liked at least one thing in my boxes. 

You can select the range for the clothes and accessories you receive but it isn't super cheap. Most of my stuff ranges around the $30-$50 range. I used to just shop at places like Forever 21 though so I definitely feel the difference in quality. I like it because I actually end up shopping less. Since you get the box at home, you're able to try stuff on with pieces you already have in your closet. They've also sent a few things that I never would have even tried on in the stores but I ended up loving them. 
They include little cards with pictures that show ways you can style the piece and you get a prepaid bag to send back whatever you don't keep. If you keep all 5 pieces, you get 25% off the order. They do pretty well of sending things I like but you just have to make sure you're super detailed about what you liked and didn't like about everything in your box when you're checking out. "

2) Start with the sure-fire varieties for your area.  You can see if there is a master gardener organization in your area that has published info on planting times &amp; plant varieties that work well in your area - or contact them via web, phone, or email to ask!  Your local county extension agent can probably also give you this information.  (They also provide soil testing service, which is a good way to see if your soil needs any kind of supplementation to work well for you:  but honestly, I have grown gardens without getting the soil tested - just added a few inches of compost - and they did fine.)

3) Some plants do better from transplants (in my opinion, tomatoes, eggplants &amp; peppers, and a lot of the herbs), but those cost more, so you could save yourself a bit of money by starting just with things that grow well from seeds. To give yourself confidence, without spending a ton of money, start with plants like leafy greens (spinach &amp; arugula), summer squash, zucchini, beans, cucumbers.  Whatever you plant should be something you actually like to eat.  Oh, and plant yourself a row of flowers too, to brighten things up:  zinnia or cosmos for example."

**If you or your SO were pregnant right now...what would you do?**

Why would you choose that?  Who would you talk to?  Why?  How will this child impact your life?  How will it change your life now for not having this child?

There is no right or wrong answer here...the individual involved will have to make the decision for themselves.  Maybe the abortion is the best option for Person A but not for Person B.  Every instance is different for that person.

I personally find the idea of abortion repugnant.  Some people can get pregnant at the drop of a hat, other it can take years and 10s of Thousands of dollars.  There are plenty of support programs for those who do decide to go through with the pregnancy(at least locally here).  I would prefer to see abortion to look like a less attractive option by having a strong social safety net and option available for those who are considering abortion.  But that is just not the case.

We have lost 4, we can tell each other names, and when they were supposed to be born, it's not something I would wish upon anyone...I can only imagine the grief and remorse one would feel is even worse when you are the one who decided on ending it.

johnnytightlips2,Documentaries,1391015921.0,"Interesting to hear. I haven't studied history to any great level (except for a few classical history courses that quite obviously focused on the Romans and the Greeks) but what we did study in school was rather British-focused. I remember there were courses that focused on Italian reunification and I attended a history club where we studied Vietnam and the Cold War, but as early as I can remember it was the Norman conquest, then the Kings up to King John, the Crusades, the Tudors, the Civil War, Victoria and then the First World War; the Second World War was generally too broad to cover.

We did, however, spend two years covering the inter-bellum period and specifically Germany in this time, with Versailles and the Weimar republic all the way up to Munich and finally the outbreak of war, and in some depth; daily German lives, Kristallnacht, things like that. So to say that the history I learned was purely based on British history would be disingenuous, but I also think it's only natural that each country focuses its attention on its own history.

Making yourselves out to be more important through that history, however, is a different question."

zkkk,AskMen,1391015979.0,"Man, that's such a hard question and it really depends on the person and it varies from person to person. It happened to me last year, really similar to you but in a shorter time. We used to do the same things as you did, our story is basically the same but the friendship lasted 1 year, it took me 6 months to tell her my feelings but she was just not into it, she did not have the same feelings. I gave it a break, and I step away, I stopped calling, hanging out etc, and then she called me two weeks after I told her my feelings, and she said if we could continue our friendship because it was something that she did not want to loose, and being friends with me is all that she wants and she enjoys being with me. So I tried to make things work again, but it just got weird, we would hang out, but it would be different, she would talk less so do I, and then she SMSed me telling that she was moving to another state, after months we would talk less and less, and as for this day, it's been 2 months we do not say a word to each other. Last week I saw her facebook page been updated, she is now in a serious relationship with another guy. So I guess that's it, it was just not meant to be.

You steping away might make her think a bit, wait if she will get in touch back with you, if she really values the connection you two have, she will call you back. But there will be up to you if you will be able to handle things, I just could not look at her and just be friends, the only thought that would come to my mind is a more serious relationship, but by knowing she was not up to it, it would break my heart constantly so it was better for me and for her for us to end the friendship."

I'm not a big fan of looking just at turnover rate because it doesn't show how much of a passing role he has for the offensive system he is in. Paul George's role is not a distributor, it's as a scorer. That's why I put AST/TO ratio.

Anyway, he's got pretty good numbers offensively, and of course he is great defensively. How high you rate him really depends on how you value each part of each player's overall game when comparing and ranking."

bloop24,leagueoflegends,1391016049.0,honestly if I were you and really wanted to get out of bronze I would stop playing adc.  you have to play near perfect to carry some games as adc in low elo because if even one tank on the other team gets fed it makes your job 200% harder whereas dealing with a fed adc isn't too hard to do as a lot of champs.  Another reason adc can't carry that hard at lower elos is you just cant affect other lanes that much since you are bot and don't power spike till later on usually.  In my experience mid or jungle are the easiest roles to carry a game with because you can exert so much map pressure and snowball other lanes as well as your own.  anyway thats just my 2 cents good luck!

keypuncher,askaconservative,1391016086.0,"&gt; It is going to take some work but I(and her) think it is possible to do it. We just need to act now. 

Our politicians don't ""act now"" on anything that hasn't become a crisis in the immediate sense.  They've been kicking the debt can down the road for 56 years.  The won't deal with it until it becomes a crisis (e.g., after interest rates go back up), by which time it will be too late.

Tea Party politicians are serious about government fiscal responsibility.  Few others are, regardless of party - and the Tea Party doesn't have the pull required to make the others deal with it.

I like a lot of the proposals you lay out for ways to fix things - they make sense.  Unfortunately, they aren't politically feasible as long as there are enough Democrats in government to stop them.

&gt; We don't need to worry about immigration reform. We need to take steps to increase revenue every we possibly can without doing damage to the current economic structure.

Yep.  The problem with *just* increasing revenue is that the Federal Government sees increased revenue as a license to increase spending even more.

Before we even think about increasing revenue, we need a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, with teeth.

&gt; Raise the Medicare and Social security tax to make them self sustainable so they can be excluded completely from the federal budget.

Pretty sure they can't be raised high enough to deal with the expected cost curves, without huge cuts in outlays.

Of course, the moment you start talking about cuts in outlays, the histrionics come out, painting anyone who wants to cut as evil and heartless.

&gt; She said it is actually high. The current debt of $17 trillion is more like $13 trillion once the Medicare and Social Security trust funds are excluded.

Pretty sure this is not correct, but I'd be interested in seeing where that comes from, if there is data to back it up."

He is not allowing for the fact that just because a woman had an abortion in the past doesn't automatically mean she'll do the same again. His post doesn't discriminate between reasons for abortion, just abortion full stop. 

My argument is that he is walling himself off from potentially wonderful women because he seems, based on what he wrote, unwilling to make those distinctions. 

Additionally, if he wants children, whether or not she had an abortion in the *past* is immaterial to whether or not she wants children now. If he says, ""I'm looking for someone to have children with.""  and she agrees that she wants that too, and they are compatible about how and when to do that, then her past is not relevant to the now except that it allowed her to make the choices in her life that led her to this present moment in time.

Most companies that have employer-provided insurance cover 80% or more of the premium cost.  For a large corporation, that is a non-trivial expense.  When premiums go up by 20% or more, as happened because of Obamacare, that can make a huge difference in the bottom line.

People aren't just warm, neutral, cool. I personally think this color analysis in seasons is more beneficial. It breaks down warm and cool tones to different seasons and what colors look better for each. 

The best way to figure out what color looks good on you is to just trying a bunch of different colored items :/  
For me, I look better with off white tops than pure white tops, which drains my face of color. So I knew I leaned more towards warm than cool. It made sense then, when i wear barbie pink lipsticks like pink pout from revlon, i look like a fool."

daisyismydog,Indiemakeupandmore,1391017044.0,"I think this is a perfectly valid question. Personally, for me, I don't buy from Urban Decay as they're owned by L'Oreal (does animal testing). Otherwise, in general I'm not interested in either the Naked 3 palette or the Silk Naturals dupes but I think another reason you may purchase from Silk Naturals is if you're interested in just specific colors. 

Additionally, Silk Naturals does seem to advertise their alternative as a better quality:  

&gt; Compare our Bare Necessities Palette to the Urban Decay Naked 3 Palette.  They're every bit as gorgeous but with more pigment, no talc, bismuth oxychloride or preservatives.  They're also Vegan and cruelty free.  

&gt; Typical pressed shadows contain up to 20% fillers and binders.  Silk Natural's loose shadows are packed with pigment and blend beautifully 

I'm not sure exactly what Silk Naturals is trying to get at because they list the ingredients of both their products and UD's and there's no bismuth oxychloride in either list. But talc is the first ingredient in the UD shadows so that's a legitimate point. Some people do avoid one or the other due to being sensitive or for health concerns so there's another reason someone might purchase SN. 

There are likely other reasons someone may purchase the Silk Naturals version over UD but these are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head. "

Regarding physical disability- perhaps in situations where quality of life would almost definitely be painful without much hope of medical solution and the child would suffer/die very soon rather than simply live differently? 

From a strictly genetic standpoint, I sort of understand the... intention... behind cleaning up the genetic pool from lighter genetic deformities (from autism to epilepsy/etc)... but it's certainly not something that could sensibly become more than personal choice (research into the genetics of your spouse before children, etc). *shrug. My husband is epileptic- can't work a regular job, drives rarely, medication won't control it. We will probably never have children for that and other reasons. Personal decision.
