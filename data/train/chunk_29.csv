herps,Libertarian,1390081755.0,"I more more or less directly accused u/wharAREyedoing of enjoying a state subsidized education earlier in the thread and he did not refute it or attempt to explain that he went to private school in his response.  But you are right it is an assumption so let's examine both scenarios.

K-12 tends to be funded at the local level with some state and federal level subsidies thrown in.  u/WhatAREyedoing parents paid taxes at the time of his education which funded schools, police, fire and other municipal services.  However others also paid those same taxes for those service and did not have children.  So in effect his public education was subsidized by those with no children currently in the public education system.  As the price would have been much higher for u/WhatAREyedoing's education if he had directly borne those costs.

If u/whatAREyedoing went to college in the 60s or 70's chances are his state college education was also heavily subsidized and he paid very little of it out of pocket.  If u/whatAREyedoing went to college in the last 30 year's he probably shouldered a increasingly  larger burden of those costs, but he still received a subsidy from the taxpayer if he had in-state tuition.

If whatAREyedoing was blessed with parents rich enough to afford private school then great, good for him.  But he always had the public safety net of attending a public school and receiving a education.

Now that u/whatAREyedoing has received these educational  benefits from his parents and their generation, he wants to cut these same benefits off for those who come after him because he doesn't want to pay taxes.  To me that's morally repugnant but that is only my opinion.  If u/whatAREyedoing wants to try to convince others to join him and elect someone that will do away with public funding of the educational system then he is free to try that.  But there will be those like me who will stand squarely in his way and personally I think we will win.  

If u/whatAREyedoing can't stand the thought of paying one more dime in taxes for the public educational system and can't convince others to join him in repealing those taxes then he is free to renounce his citizenship and live in a country that has no such system.  Best of luck to him."

I thought, ""oh shit, these guys have been here for over a year, and they're scared? Oh shit. Sniper. Oh shit oh shit oh shit."" The shooting stops, and we're all on top of the wall surrounding the base, and it turns out that the Jordanians had never taken fire before either, and were just being women about it.

Lluxx,actuallesbians,1390081933.0,"Aw, this sounds horrible. I really hope things get better for you guys. 

My advice is it's time to have a very frank discussion. Something like, 'Girlfriend, I know you say you still love me, but I feel like I'm being ignored at the moment and it doesn't seem like you're happy. We need to talk about this.'

Ask her about the lack of intimacy, how she expects you guys to see each other, the visiting ex's Facebook page. It'll be hard, but try not to get angry, accusatory or upset; stay calm and voice your problems clearly. 

If she won't talk about it or gets defensive, it's time to take a break from the relationship. Maybe - like another poster suggested - she is depressed or just feeling crap, but if she can't discuss her feelings with you like an adult, she can't expect you to stick around for something you don't understand. 

If the talk goes well, both of you need to make concrete plans on how to change it. Sort out how frequently you should see each other and how you would both like to be treated to the other. Again, if she agrees to something and then continues not to make an effort it's time for you to move on. 

It's also okay for you to just leave her, though. It doesn't sound like she's making you very happy and being with someone who doesn't seem to want you can really do a number on self-esteem. You deserve better than this and to be with someone who can communicate their problems with you. "

Well, as soon as you can provide evidence that this is an effective treatment, I would support it. However, since it's NOT an effective treatment (unlike transition for trans people) it wouldn't make any sense to support it.

&gt;But the mind wants that.

Right, which makes perfect sense for a woman's mind. Again, perfectly normal working condition. It's a mismatch issue, not a ""one part is wrong"" issue. What's confusing about this? 

&gt;not because the science or an inherent change in it, it was because people thought it was offensive to categorize it as such.

As a matter of fact, this statement is incorrect; the science supports the current conclusion, not the conclusion from 50 years ago.

&gt;Like I said, if you say something is impossible you are almost always going to be wrong.

When I say ""this particular method of accomplishing something will never work"", that's something I can often say with a great degree of certainty. 

&gt;. The consensus is not a true consensus because enough research hasn't been done because of the societal hurdles in doing so.

... Quite frankly, this is fantasy land level shit right here. Up until this point, you were at least trying to be logical, but I don't think you realize how many people would LOVE to fund anti-trans research. If this is the shit you are going to say, I'm done with this conversation. If we're ignoring current research, there's really no point in even having the conversation; at that point, we're just making shit up and pretending it's real.

If Americans sound now as Brits sounded originally, then why do we have dialects like New York and Boston where they drop the R's as in British English?  America is a metaphorical melting pot of cultures from all over the world.  This means that people from Germany spoke their own English, people from France spoke their own English, people from Italy, Spain, Portugal, and so on.  American English is just a jumbled mess of different people speaking different English until it blends together.

Renner1,OneY,1390082517.0,"&gt; But the point is assumption of intent is a big deal, so just assuming someone is dressing the way they are to get attention is how a lot of harassment starts.

Not really. I don't buy into third wave feminist statistics, for one thing, largely because they're bunk. Claims about ""I was harassed 50 times in the past week by nasty men leering with their eyes"" are also largely rubbish- hysterical and overly hyperbolic.

I fail to see any other reason why someone would dress in a way that shows off their physical assets. 
""I want to feel good about myself""-- yeah, because you know people think you're sexy. 

&gt; Basically, 'she obviously wants us to look, look how she's dressed' is weak. It's assuming her intent, and extrapolating based on that assumption. 

It's the same sort of thing as men in perfect physical condition walking around with little on-- there's not other explanation then ""they're showing off"".

I don't mean wearing less if you're a man working on something overly physical and it's preposterously hot out-- I mean men just going down the street with their shirts off. 

If they're in top physical condition you're going to assume that they're actively intending to show off.

&gt; The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009.

Minimum wage laws apply to everyone, FEDERALLY.  That includes Tennessee.

&gt; An employer may pay a tipped employee not less than $2.13 an hour in direct wages if that amount plus the tips received equal at least the federal minimum wage

You still have to receive the federal minimum wage, BY LAW.  A portion of that can come from tips, but you still have to make the minimum.  There are lawyers who would LOVE to sue on your behalf if your tips aren't making up the difference.  Many restaurants get shut down for that bullshit.

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1390083508.0,"The O2 sensor is on the exhaust pipe. Bank 1 sensor 1 means it's the one before the catalytic converter, but before you just go sticking an O2 sensor on hoping it solves your problem you may want to do some more research and diagnosis before you buy something you don't need. Especially considering all the other codes you have. Alternatively I would google all those other codes you have. They look to be all EVAP codes.

http://www.obd-codes.com/p2195

**O2 A/F Sensor Signal Biased/Stuck Lean (Bank 1 Sensor 1)**

&gt;**What does that mean?** This code is a generic powertrain code. It is considered generic because it applies to all makes and models of vehicles (1996-newer), although specific repair steps may be slightly different depending on the model. On some vehicles, such as Toyotas, this is actually referring to A/F sensors, Air/Fuel ratio sensors. Which are basically more sensitive versions of oxygen sensors. The powertrain control module (PCM) monitors the air/fuel ratio of the exhaust using oxygen (O2) sensors, and tries to keep things at the normal air/fuel ratio of 14.7:1 via the fuel system. The oxygen A/F sensor outputs a voltage reading that the PCM uses. This DTC is set when the air/fuel ratio as read by the PCM has strayed so far from 14.7:1 that the PCM can no longer correct it. Bank #1 is the side of the engine that contains cylinder #1. This code specifically refers to the sensor between the engine and catalytic converter (not the one behind it).



**Causes**

&gt; Potential causes of a P2195 code include: 

&gt;Oxygen (O2) or A/F ratio sensor or sensor heater malfunction 

&gt;Open or short in O2 sensor circuit (wiring, harness) 

&gt;Fuel pressure or fuel injector problem 

&gt;Faulty PCM Intake air or engine vacuum leaks 

&gt;Faulty fuel injector(s) Fuel pressure too high or too low 

&gt;PCV system leak/fault A/F sensor relay faulty

&gt;MAF sensor malfunction 

&gt;ECT sensor malfunction 

&gt;Fuel pressure too low 

&gt;Fuel leak Air suction in air intake system



&gt;**Diagnostic Steps &amp; Possible Solutions**

&gt; Use a scan tool to get readings from the sensor, and monitor the short and long term fuel trim values and O2 sensor or Air Fuel Ratio sensor readings. Also, look at the freeze frame data to see the conditions at the time the code was set. That should help determine if the O2 AF sensor is operating correctly. Compare with manufacturers values. 

&gt;If you don’t have access to a scan tool, you could use a multimeter and back-probe the terminals on the O2 sensor wiring connector. Check for shorts to ground, short to power, open circuits, etc. Compare specs with manufacturers specifications. Visually inspect the wiring &amp; connectors leading to the sensor, check for loose connectors, wires rubbed/chaffed, melted wires, etc. Repair as necessary. Visually inspect vacuum lines. 

&gt;You can also test for vacuum leaks using propane or carburetor cleaner along the hoses while the engine is running, if the RPMs change you likely found the leak. Be very careful if doing that, and have a fire extinguisher within reach in case something goes wrong. For example, on a bunch of Ford vehicles, the hose that goes from the PCV to the throttle body can melt causing P2195, P2197, P0171, and/or P0174 codes. If a vacuum leak is determined to be the problem, it would be prudent to replace all vacuum lines if they are getting older, becoming brittle, etc. Use a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM) to check other sensors mentioned such as MAF, IAT, for proper operation. 
Perform a fuel pressure test, verify readings against manufacturers specification. 

&gt;If you’re on a budget and you only have an engine with more than one bank and the problem is only with one bank, you could swap the sensor from one bank to the other, clear the code, and see if the code is followed to the other bank. That would tell you it is the sensor/heater itself that’s failed. Check for outstanding technical service bulletins (TSB) for your vehicle, in some cases the PCM can be recalibrated to fix this (not a common fix though). TSBs could also call for replacement of the sensor. When replacing oxygen / AF sensors, be sure to use a high quality ones. In many cases non-OEM sensors are of lesser quality and will not perform correctly. We strongly recommend you stick with OEM brand replacements.

I would imagine quite a few of them were. Stands to reason, anyways, considering that the red pill as a thing is fairly obscure.

&gt; I don't watch the show, are the characters naked a lot?

I haven't watched it either, but apparently that's a big part of it and it's left people confused as to why it's in it.

""Because people are naked sometimes"" doesn't cut it at all as an explanation.

&gt; If someone calls one of the actors ""slutty"" or something for appearing nude on camera often, which I have seen people do. There's really no point in making those judgements. If that's what someone chooses to do, that's up to them. 

In this case it's just something that a lot of people aren't getting.

I haven't heard people calling fictional characters ""sluts"" or anything else-- but I don't think it's unacceptable. 

For example, if there's a character that acts a certain way and their shit choices come back to bite them in the ass, it's not rude in any way to call the character an idiot or careless, or thoughtless.

If there's a character who acts like a huge cocktease, or who's partially based around being someone who makes extremely poor decisions in the sexual sense, and then can't deal with the fallout, then I see nothing wrong with people discussing it in the context of the show or just talking about the character.

&gt; I don't think I remember that, I'll have to look it up.

It's not that newsworthy as it is, apart from the hilarious squawking from Denham and her associates.

 &gt; That's a good point. Although the most graphic sex scenes in the show were Tony's dreams, and not women he had sex with in real life. Still, there was a purpose to the story line for the sex scenes. 

Exactly, very different then if the show just decided to have tony taking a shit every other episode because ""mob bosses go to the toilet in real life"".

&gt; Well, he did walk around outside in the morning in just a robs and boxer shorts, but that's not really nudity. 

Yeah, and it wasn't like they focused on him going to get the paper or looking at the ducks on an excessive basis.

&gt; It doesn't really bother me, I just think it's kind of egotistical of her to claim that her show speaks for everyone. I don't know of any other TV shows that make that claim. 

It's just Denham being a moron, and likely the rest of the primary cast and the producers and other people deeply involved in creating it.

Her stupid-level feminist thing, especially the ""I'm super thin skinned but BODY POSITIVITY"", is also a big part of it. She thinks she can speak for a plurality of women when she can't.

If you're going for *bright* then Sugarpill is probably what you're looking for, and OCC is also technically indie but those two are more mainstream. 

If your giftee is part of any fandoms (Doctor Who, Harry Potter, etc.) I would also check out some of the more themed shops such as Victorian Disco Cosmetics. "

Renner1,confession,1390084526.0,"&gt; Some non-white people were very successful in the US prior to the Civil Rights movement. Unfortunately, they were still not treated the same as white people. For example, a hospital might have hired a black doctor, but they would still be expected to use a separate bathroom. I saw a movie once, it was a true story, about a surgeon who experienced segregation. He actually had to use a separate entrance in the back of the hospital to go to work. 

&gt; In most places though, they would make every attempt to hire a white person. Not to mention the social prejudices minorities faced every day. 


I'm not saying it wasn't a major issue in America at the time. Apart from the cold-war political paranoia (and I don't bring this up in defence of the SU or communists in America, as I don't agree with Soviet-style rule as it was or pure Communism in general), the issue of segregation in the South and the attitude towards some black people in America in general was the main issue in terms of overt and sometimes widespread discrimination.

Which isn't to say that a black person couldn't become very wealthy or successful or held in high esteem by the public-- it largely did depend on where they were living, although what you said about it not all being as simple as ""South-- bad, North-- good"" is something that should be taken into account.

&gt; I actually read somewhere, I don't remember where, that some scientists believe women and men used to actually be fairly close in strength and height, but centuries and millennia of separate gender roles and performing different tasks.

Sure, especially the precursors to homo sapiens would be more physically similar in different factors-- roughly the same size, more similar looking in terms of bone structure and appearance in general, things like that.

&gt; Still, I can see why men were considered the strong gender, and women physically weak, but I never understood why women's role in society was considered less important.

I don't know if you could say that they were considered less important, even if they didn't take prominence in terms of leading a community (although female community leaders obviously wasn't unheard of in different situations) or defending the community or civilization or whatever.

I don't think saying that the sexes are important in different ways (in context of the time, the beginnings of permanent society and the development of society) automatically would mean that one is by default less important."

&gt; For him, the girls in his life are no more complex than the ones in his games, and that's a bad message to send since in this universe, he's always right. His equating of 2D and 3D girls and the fact that almost no one calls him out on it is what ruined the series for me.

I totally understand this criticism. However, I'd like to mention that the entire third season is basically that entire premise getting ""called out"". If seasons one and two are satire, season three is deconstruction. I won't spoil details, but basically, the girls actually have agency, Keima's actions catch up to him, his plans fall apart because he created them assuming that his conquering targets were much more simple than they actually are, and the series ends on a rather low note, with Keima basically questioning his lifestyle.

duggtodeath,atheism,1390085947.0,"&gt; Faith doesn't necessarily mean religion; although it's most often tied to it.

Perfectly fair point. I only used religion in my argument.

&gt; Science uses faith; one of the basic principles of science is that you can't prove anything, but you just gather as much evidence as you can to convince people that it's true.

I have to stop you there. This sounds flowery and agreeable, but it misses something huge. I also think is an apologist tactic. Lemme clarify. I;m not that smart, so I gotta steal this:

""One of the more common strategies employed by religious fundamentalists to undermine science is to mischaracterise it as a faith-based belief system, the equivalent of religion. When the best argument to advance the religious cause is to pretend that science shares its strength, this may be an indication that fundamentalism has run out of ideas. After all, fundamentalists cannot honestly argue that religion leads to better societal outcomes than science. This is not what the record for the past several centuries show. Most people today, including their shrinking base of low intellectual achievers, know that it is science, not religion, that is responsible for humanity's greatest achievements.""

""[Now], many early advancements were made by scientists with religious leanings. But what they seldom acknowledge is that all of these scientists, like their secular colleagues, relied on the scientific method. None derived their discoveries from religious insight. Furthermore, some of them, including Copernicus, Galileo and Darwin were successful, in spite of, not because of their religious affiliation.""

""For example, when scientists say that a Big Bang, occurring roughly 14-billion-years ago, triggered the formation of the universe, they do so, not as an expression of a new religious faith, but because they have found evidence that leads them to that conclusion.""

""Therefore, there is no inherent conspiracy against religion when scientists doubt the creation story in the Bible. Scientists doubt it because there is simply no supporting evidence, and what evidence they do have, points to a Big Bang, a far different account. The same is true in archaeology.""

""[So, can] science and religion belong in ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" or non-competing spheres? Why can't we simply live and let live? Unfortunately, fundamentalists rarely confine themselves to their sphere, where they are free to engage each other in pointless theological and philosophical debates, searching in vain for ""wisdom."" When they encroach into areas like science, which are outside their capabilities, the result is often to discourage the development of the technical talent that we need, in addition to promoting social disunity, an us versus them.""

See? Science is not faith-based! Lemme steal something else from someone smarter than me:

""The scientific method makes one assumption, and one assumption only: the Universe obeys a set of rules. That’s it. There is one corollary, and that is that if the Universe follows these rules, then those rules can be deduced by observing the way Universe behaves. This follows naturally; if it obeys the rules, then the rules must be revealed by that behavior.""

""Now think on this: the computer you are reading this on is entirely due to science. The circuits are the end result of decades, centuries of exploration in how electricity works and how quantum particles behave. The monitor is a triumph of scientific engineering, whether it’s a CRT or an LCD flat panel. The mouse might use an LED, or a simple ball-and-wheel. The keyboard uses springs, the wireless uses radio technology, the speakers use electromagnetism.*

""Look around. Cars, airplanes, buildings. iPods, books, clothing. Agriculture, plumbing, waste disposal. Light bulbs, vacuum cleaners, ovens. These are all the products of scientific research. If your TV breaks, you can pray that it’ll spontaneously start working again, but my money would be on someone who has learned how to actually fix it based on scientific and engineering principles.""

""All the knowledge we have accumulated over the millennia comes together in a harmonious symphony of science. We’re not guessing here: this stuff was designed using previous knowledge developed in a scientific manner over centuries. And it works. All of this goes to support our underlying assumption that the Universe obeys rules that we can deduce.""

""Are there holes in this knowledge? Of course. Science doesn’t have all the answers. But science has a tool, a power that its detractors never seem to understand. Science is not simply a database of knowledge. It’s a method, a way of finding this knowledge. Observe, hypothesize, predict, observe, revise. Science is provisional; it’s always open to improvement. Science is even subject to itself. If the method itself didn’t work, we’d see it. Our computers wouldn’t work (OK, bad example), our space probes wouldn’t get off the ground, our electronics wouldn’t work, our medicine wouldn’t work. Yet, all these things do in fact function, spectacularly well. Science is a check on itself, which is why it is such an astonishingly powerful way of understanding reality.""

""And that right there is where science and religion part ways. Science is not based on faith. Science is based on evidence. We have evidence it works, vast amounts of it, billions of individual pieces that fit together into a tapestry of reality. That is the critical difference. Faith, as it is interpreted by most religions, is not evidence-based, and is generally held tightly even despite evidence against it. In many cases, faith is even reinforced when evidence is found contrary to it.""

""To say that we have to take science on faith is such a gross misunderstanding of how science works that it can only be uttered by someone who is wholly ignorant of how reality works.""

This is way too long, I'll address your other points in separate comment."

True enough, but that's different from cultural attitudes toward sexuality. For example, you don't need to know about how women only drop one egg a month to know that our culture says that men are successful if they have sex with lots of women, but women are supposed to have sex with only one guy.

&gt;OOhhh yeah. I really think the gay rights movement being somewhat normalized is helping it more than anything imho.

Also feminism's efforts to normalize female sexuality. You know, convincing people that the clitoris exists and stuff.

&gt;I... don't think those two words really work together

(normal and sinful) what I mean is that there's an overly moralistic group in our culture that says ""hey that's a sin!"" and guys are embarrassed about it (like we're embarrassed about people seeing us poop) but it's kind of an accepted thing by most of our culture that guys masturbate.

temp9876,relationship_advice,1390087166.0,"So you went back to a failed relationship to try to fix it... with someone who is currently not rational.  Gee, how surprising that it went wrong.

She is probably right more than you want to know.  She knows you're just there for the baby, there's no way you're hiding your feelings from her.  And you're doing it when she's in an emotionally compromised state that puts strain on even the healthiest of relationships.

You've got to make up your mind.  If you're going to be there, BE THERE.  That means coping with her pregnant moodiness and humoring her bad moods and placating her irrational demands.  If you don't care enough about her to do that, don't be with her right now because you're making it worse.

Ask dads, even in healthy relationships women go a bit crazy while pregnant, and yours was no where near healthy to begin with.  So in or out.  But there really is no benefit to what you're doing right now."

eighthgear,asoiaf,1390087566.0,"&gt; There's a mystery there on how the retargs got so dumb so quickly when it came to their dragons.

Having the dragons outside of the capital would increase the risk of rebellion and civil war between members of the dynasty. Indeed, a civil war like that did occur - the Dance of the Dragons - and the fact that many dragons were at Dragonstone played a big part of it.

Most of the dragons perished during this war, the king who took the throne after the conflict, Aegon III, had an active fear and hatred for the creatures, due to various childhood scars from the war - most notably, the fact that his mother was eaten alive by a dragon in front of him. The last dragon died during the reign of Aegon III. Some speculate that the maesters colluded, perhaps with Aegon III, to either kill the dragons, or ""reduce"" them - making them smaller and more docile - through poisons."

Avistew,polyamory,1390087793.0,"I think you feeling like a burden and him feeling pressured are probably related, or caused by the same things.

I think you guys are being too... pressured is a good word, really, about sex. Sex isn't about making each other come, or about coming. It's about sharing an intimate experience. In established relationships, it's also about sharing affection.

When you hug him or kiss him, you probably don't worry if you're using the exact amount of pressure that he likes best, or if your hug or kiss is somehow not perfect. You're just hugging, kissing, because you feel like it, because you love each other.

This might be a bad example because when sex life and intimacy goes down, hugs and kisses tend to as well. But the idea is... be affectionate for the sake of it. Don't worry about orgasms.

Yes, she comes more often and/or more easily (at least with him). Good for her. But it only points out issues you were already having, so I agree, leave her out of this. Their relationship seems to be going fine. Now, if he starts refusing sex with you, and in the middle of it going to have sex with her instead, then yes, it's a problem, because he's running away from fixing your issues. Otherwise, she's not causing any problems, just making you realise some were there.

I would suggest being affectionate (without sex) more often. Hugging, kissing, snuggling. Rubbing his shoulders or whatever. Have more touch, more contact. Some dressed, some naked.

If at some point sex happens, great. Don't focus on it being perfect, finishing a certain way or another, or whether you guys will come or if he's staying hard. Just keep snuggling and being affectionate and let things go the way they end up going.

Later, if you want to take off the pressure, you could start with getting yourself off instead of doing it after he's passed out. Lots of guys find that very hot, and there would be zero pressure to make you come if you've come already.

Waiting until after he's come is just a bad idea. Some guys just fall asleep and shut down once they've come. It looks like he might be that way. And he doesn't have the excitement and adrenaline of a new relationship keeping him up.

In short, my advice is to be more affectionate, first in non-sexual ways, then let it move on to sexual ways. Don't set goals about orgasms or specific acts and enjoy whatever happens, and make sure he knows you're enjoying it. It's quite possible he took your feeling like a burden as a challenge, but as he could never make you stop feeling that way, he just stopped wanting to try that hard because it was discouraging. So work on that together.

Some women never come at all, and that doesn't mean they can't have or enjoy sex. And they're not a burden, and neither are you. You need to really accept that before you can have a satisfying sex life.

I would be interesting in knowing more about your relationship with your boyfriend, too. How do things go with him?"

Irrelevant, I'm talking about consumers, not producers.

For the rest of it, there's a fair amount of feminist literature answering all of those points. I'll try to link to a couple articles demonstrating the industries saying they're completely uninterested in exploring female audiences, to their financial detriment. Also a few demonstrating how unwelcome females feel in these areas.

&gt;Do games need to be covered in bows and ponies so that we will know that they are in the target market? No! Women will adopt creative products which they find appealing and not necessarily only when they are pandered to.

Have you seen Anita Sarkeesian's videos on tropes in video games? She has a bad rap but nothing she says is unreasonable. In the third one she talks about how we don't need the color pink or hair bows and makeup to tell us someone is female, but developers use those things as gender markers anyways. I don't *want* everything made for girls to be pink. It's the people making things for girls that seem to think we have to have everything in pink. You know what it takes to target a female audience? A realistic, relatable female heroine.

IAmNotAPerson6,videos,1390087930.0,"Reddit is much more like mainstream culture than we like to think (there are some things that are far from it, but most of the time it's in sync). Sure, we aren't fond of religion, being an atheist is the norm here, but we don't talk about it. The lore is that it used to be common here to be all ""I'M AN ATHEIST, FUCK RELIGION."" But even so much as mention being an atheist around here now and you'll attract loads of ""DAE Euphoria?"" type comments. Same with any comments hating a religion in particular. So yeah, atheism and anti-religious sentiment is the norm here, but only acceptable if you keep it to yourself. Disliking Christianity follows the same rule. Say you hate it, you get ""Le fedora"" shit inundating your inbox.

Islam is the exception though. Mass Islam hate flowing around here. I very strongly suspect this is because of what I mentioned before, reddit being much more in tune with mainstream culture and popular views in the media than we let on (meaning we're also more conservative than we think most of the time). So obviously those ideas will seep in. Anti-Islamic sentiment is a *very* strong idea these days in many cultures and in the media, so it only makes sense that it would be pretty pervasive on reddit as well."
temp9876,Accounting,1390087941.0,"I think it's laughable. I strained my eyes rolling them too much and had to stop reading.

Automation has already happened to the accounting industry, several times.  As a profession and as an industry we are constantly learning and evolving.   It isn't making people obsolete.  It makes certain skills obsolete, but not the whole person.  The more automated it gets the more technologically savvy we have to be.  

Even the simplest tasks have more to them than people realize.  Sometimes I get annoyed at having to use ""efficient"" processes like data analytics or the great synergy that is our Indian subsidiary.  It's a huge pain in the ass vetting the data that comes back!  I find that people really underestimate the human element of data entry and clerical work.  

I don't think anyone has anything to worry about unless they resist the changes as they come.  It's like working in IT, you think they can finish school and just rest on their laurels?  No.  You keep learning and growing or you become redundant, but your job doesn't disappear, you just lose the ability to do it if you aren't growing."

So before this thread is swallow with downvotes and shitty posts, while not trying to say this post is less shitty:

For my experience, you'll have to see what type of girls are generaly more attracted to you (if you're lucky it's the same you do are attracted to). And that means what do you have to offer to a relationship that differs from the other guys, and what you do have that is attractive. I'm not talking about compensating, I'm talking about looking into yourself and find out what you can use in yourself to conquer or attract a girl. For example, if you're at lunch break in your job and some girl is reading a book, talking about that book it's a good way to start a conversation, as it is a easy. This means, if you are a reader you can use it in the datting field. So if there is this girl all alone that is reading ""Farewell to Arms"" and you go and just ask ""Hemingway?"" at try to talk about it it's a easy way to make a connection. I've never done this, but once I was reading Fitzgerald on the subway and some girl asked me about it and we get to know each other. The same thing for music or movies or any common interest you know you both have. People always like to talk about what they like!"

Also, the difference between 60lbs and 100lbs is a lot, and carrying a person puts a different strain on your body than carrying a pack which has straps to distribute the load evenly and correctly.

Unless this guy was one of the strongest people on the planet, there's no way he could carry your 100lb sister for 5 miles in knee-deep snow.

mislabeledhuman,asktransgender,1390088350.0,"&gt;I'm terrified of becoming a girl and never pass.

Almost everyone is worried about that. There are lots of things you can do to make yourself pass better: HRT, make-up &amp; hair, clothes, surgeries, etc. Genetics and age are just kind of a starting point for you to go off of. Some people get bigger head starts and have an easier time than others.

&gt;Any late transitioners here?

Yup.

&gt;Any links to late transitioner timelines, youtubes, etc?

I posted [mine](http://imgur.com/a/ARHgD) recently. Still doing boymode. You can also search on /r/transpassing and /r/transtimelines, people usually put their age in the title.

&gt;Is it really that bad being a guy? 

It was for me. It just got to the point where I just couldn't deal with it anymore. Worrying about passing stopped me from transitioning for a long time.

&gt;Hard work being a guy (or girl) so either way I have to do work to be pretty or handsome, right?

True, but would you rather spend your effort being pretty or being handsome?

Honestly, 27 is not old at all. And if you pass 80% of the time already without HRT, then you'll probably get the other 20% with it."

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390089024.0,"&gt;TL;DR - If all the thumbnails for the highlight videos on your stream is of your tits, you're an attention whore not a gaming stream.

Why do you presume she cares enough about you that she does it for ""attention"" (imo a pretty damn vain way to look at it) rather than her doing it straight up for money/because it is the thing that works for her in regards to making money? 

There is next to no ""only for attention"" in the world of streaming because in the world of streaming attention equals money. So within the meta game of who can make the most money on twitch, shouldn't it make sense for people to optimize their strategies?  (consider people like Madonna or Lady Gaga who specialized in manipulating attention)

=&gt; I'm bringing this up in the context that the implication seems to be that ""the wanting attention"" accusation attempts to paint people in a childish/not to be taken serious when really underneath is the ""wanting money"" motivation, a highly grown up motivation. "

Etymology of place names is somewhere between funny and disappointing, in my experience.

If you're stumped, only foreign places or ancient places will have conlang names. Everything founded recently will have a name made of very comprehensible words. If you've got a common language, or trade language, then every place will have a *unique* name in your trade language, which is often unrelated to its real name.

I felt the same way before my first.  Vaginal delivery holds such an incredible range of possibilities, while C-sections give you the reassurance of knowing what to expect, it lets you feel in control. 

But as you know, there are advantages to a routine vaginal delivery over a c-section. If you're going to compare the being sore and healing part, you've got to keep in mind that vaginal delivery is what your bits were designed for, which is going to affect the healing process.  

I delivered vaginally and it was not what I was afraid of.  I won't deny that it was hard, but my body handled it.  I squirted the little beast out and had a super shitty period for a couple of weeks.  I was mobile almost immediately, bounced back right away.

eighthgear,asoiaf,1390089924.0,"I guess a lot of knowledge was lost with the Doom. Of course, the Targaryens lived on Dragonstone for quite some time before conquering Westeros. I guess the arrogance that comes with power meant that Aegon the Conqueror's descendants came to simply rely on their dragons (and these things live for huge amounts of time - Vhagar, from the days of the Conquest, was still active during the Dance) without putting much thought into the process of raising them. The Dance likely saw the death of most of the war-capable dragons, and Aegon III clearly had no interest in dragon breeding.

Dragons seemed to have thrived on Dragonstone before the Dance, and furthermore, they seemed to have been much more ""tame"" than one would expect. I mean, they are still dragons, but Dragonstone was home to many of them, and they didn't seem to go after the local population or anyone who wasn't provoking them. So yeah, Dragonstone is where you would want to raise dragons."

TheTempest510,AskReddit,1390090910.0,"TLDR at the bottom,

I tried when I was about 14. Parents divorced when I was two, mother was beaten by first step-dad and I felt like it was my fault because I couldn't protect her at age 8-10. They divorced when i was 10. My mom abandoned my little siblings and I on my 13th birthday. 

I blamed myself till I was about 16. I thought back to every time my mother told me to be quiet, or stop running, or go to my room, and I believed that I forced her to use the drugs she did, forced her to abandon my little siblings and I. I felt that I took my little siblings' mother from them.

I went to live with my dad and his wife. I rebelled due to depression, anger, pain, etc. My new step mom left my dad, saying she couldn't handle me. 

My dad put me in a troubled kids correctional home, where I tried to kill myself by playing Russian Roulette. I'll explain that now.

 I believed and believe suicides go to hell. I'm not preaching, just my belief. So, I decided I'd leave one round in the six-shot revolver that I stole from the Correctional Home's office, a building separate from the actual home. it was in the Staff President's lockbox. I don't know why, but the key was left right on top of the box. 

Anyway I decided that if I spun the chamber, pulled the trigger, and spun again, five times, then it would have enough chance involved that it wouldn't be suicide, more accident.

Well, apparently I'm a boss at Russian Roulette, because here I stand an almost 20 year-old Marine.

I met the love of my life recently, and while there are still days where the straggling suicidal thought comes by, I no longer take action or want to. I'm actually happy.

TL:DR; Bad childhood

Moral of the story being believe it or not, eventually, things do get better. No matter how deep you get buried, you can always come back up. Suicide really is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

You statement is ignorant and wrong.  Do I sit here and pontificate on Yorkshire pudding or whatnot?  Or fish and chips or curry?  Not really, because I do not know enough about it.

From your flair, I'm assuming you live in the UK, though I suppose you could also be from Canada, NZ, Aus, etc.  I've Lived in the UK, the quality of your beef is ATROCIOUS.  I'm quite certain the rest of Europe would agree with that statement, and generally, beef from the Western Hemisphere is going to be better than most of what you would find in Europe (excluding some specialty breeds).  So I could see why you would think the meat would be bland, but I can assure you it is not.  The same would go for top quality deli meat (pastrami/brisket), where at most you would put on some mustard.

So really, like the woman above who apologized after she admitted she knew nothing about beer and was just having a bad day, you should not speak of that which you do not know in a sub which exists to mock ignorance.

Deezl-Vegas,changemyview,1390091855.0,"There's several interesting points to be made here. Firstly, more is communicated in writing than words alone. Every piece tells you something about the writer. Using improper grammar can leave the impression that the writer didn't care about the message enough to proof it or that the writer is less educated. For instance, if you're resume is trying to communicate that your experience is sufficient, improper grammar within will lessen its effect.

Secondly, improper syntax leads to a lot of rereading and slows down the reader. Every time you read through a typo or misplaced comma, your brain usually makes the correction to the right understanding of the phrase. However, it also notices the mistake, and the reader needs to reread the sentence to make sure that everything was understood correctly. It's much more of a chore to read error-laden work because of this. If you're writing something, it's assumed that you'd like it to be read, so I feel that it's discourteous to the reader to not proof your final statement.

The third reason is that you can do more with your words when you have correct grammar and an understanding of the language. You can make puns and interesting lyrics, of course, and many entertaining playwrights have used grammar in their plays to great effect. However, more than that, the way you use your punctuation plays into your tone and rhythm. The better you know the rules of language, the more you can play with in your writing.

I'd agree, strictly speaking, if you're trying to pass someone a quick note to communicate something, it's only important that the message be clear enough to communicate your point. I noticed that you made many mistakes in your post, and I didn't mind at all, despite working as an editor. Just know that there's a lot to be said for correct usage and proper grammar, and know that you communicate more with your speech and writing than just your words and their intended effect."

redyellowand,TrueAskReddit,1390092972.0,"(I'm speaking about Western middle-class society here because I don't really know about sports in any other cultures. Actually I don't know much about sports, period.)

People have been watching men play sports for over 2,500 years. There are a couple of instances of women competing in the ancient Olympic Games, but women by and large were not even allowed to watch.

I have no freakin clue what went on from 500-1500 in terms of how people lived their lives, but I do know by the 1500s women's dress became more constrictive, and constrictive dress conveyed status (because it implied your wife/daughter did not need to be working). So women weren't even allowed access to organized sports.

Susan B Anthony said something about the bicycle being a tool of liberation for women, and that happened in the 1880s-early 1900s. By the early 1900s, it was acceptable for women to do sporty things like hiking, and there are a few photos from my college of women playing basketball from the 1910s. 

To add to that, Title IX wasn't passed until 1973, so women's sports at the college level didn't even have a lot of funding. I feel like it's really hard to get good at sports (or anything) without proper funding.

So maybe ""women suck at sports"" but there's also just a multi-millennium history of men playing sports while the same opportunity has really only been afforded to women in the last forty or fifty years or so. "

It's like most countries follow a flow chart of 

Problem that needs fixing -&gt; Soliciting expert advise -&gt; Figuring out how much it will cost -&gt; Writing a bill that allocate funds to implement expert advise.

Whereas the US is

Problem that needs solving -&gt; Ignore it -&gt; Did it go away? no? -&gt; belatedly form a committee in the House and Senate -&gt; Listen to expert advice -&gt; Find out that expert advise will cost too much -&gt; Get advise from X politically and financially motivated PAC that promises they can do it at 1/10 the cost -&gt; Implement ridiculously convoluted bill to implement PAC's plan -&gt; Act shocked *shocked* when cost balloons over 5000% over budget and fails to fix the problem in the first place -&gt; Run for office saying you plan to cut taxes because of waste such as X PAC's plan.

TL;DR: The US government would work much better if it just spent money in clear and direct ways with the advice of experts. Instead politicians are so obsessed with cutting taxes that they'll ignore actual experts and instead listen to corporate con-men."

The [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/2010/12/30/freakonomics-radio-you-say-repugnant-i-say-lets-do-it/) team discussed a slightly less, er, ghastly solution to the problem - a paired organ exchange:

&gt;The Harvard economist Alvin E. Roth, a specialist in market design, helped invent a “paired donation” organ exchange that finds matches for compatible organ donors.

&gt;Here’s how it works: A willing donor enters the exchange along with a person she wants to give an organ to (her husband, for instance) but with whom she is biologically incompatible. This pair is matched with a similar pair of people so that each pair’s donor is compatible with the other pair’s recipient. Although this organ-for-organ transaction is in fact a sort of market, it doesn’t provoke the repugnance of a cash exchange.

StuHardy,WritingPrompts,1390093655.0,"Thanks for choosing to fly with RyanAir!

Before you embark on the holiday you need from your hectic 9-5, we just want to remind you of a few things before you reach your seat:

* Make sure to print off your boarding pass before you arrive. Remember, printer ink is expensive, and even though bulk buying for a company is far cheaper than buying a personal cartridge in the long run, you will be charged for not bringing the boarding pass to the gate, unlike any other major airline.
* If you're checking in luggage, ensure it fits the Nazian weight and size limits - this is to ensure that everyone can have their required luggage space, even if they don't use it. Failure to comply to our sizing charts, much smaller than other airlines, despite our main competitors using the exact same planes as us, will resort in us charging the maximum amount for baggage.
* Carry-on luggage must adhere to weight and size restrictions, again to ensure it all fits within our flight cabins. Our number one measuring too is our patented 'SodKnowz', in which our flight attendants just guess if your luggage is oversized or not. Failure to comply (say it with me) will resort in us charging the maximum amount for cabin baggage.
* Our staff are here to ensure you get on to your flight as quickly as possible. In order to be our most efficient, our staff have had certain aspects of their presentation removed. This includes smiling, being approachable, having life in their eyes, not-being-condiscending and kindness; all to ensure your flight takes off as soon as possible.
* Our announcements will let you know the great offers RyanAir has, such as being on time 90% of all flights. We'd like to remind all customers that this has nothing to do with adding an extra hour to journey times to accommodate the runway being 'busy', or that our pilots filate Michael O'Leary before take-off.

Did you manage to get all that? If not, you can print off a copy, for a charge of £4.95+ tax.

Thanks for choosing to fly with RyanAir!"

AlfredHawthorneHill,AskReddit,1390094401.0,"It is waaay less expensive and complicated to call it off now rather than after you marry.  You owe an explanation to nobody except to her - and it sounds like she already knows what is wrong.

I notice that this is not your first post about having reservations about tying the knot with this girl and about having problems in your relationship.  She certainly sounds like she is in denial (at least) and like you rather would not deal with the embarrassment and aggravation that cancellation will cause.

Let me put it this way:  if you were arguing - with increasing vexation - with someone for months on end, would you start a business with her?  Would you buy a house - or even sign a lease - with her?  Marriage is similar - except once you marry and live together you arm her with the ability to accuse you of things that, conveniently, nobody else could witness and therefore dispute.

Everyone has an opinion, but you are and should be in control of your own life.  Letting other people force you to marry or not is a bad idea.

It might suck for a while - and I say ""might"" because it seems you will feel a rather large sense of relief once you call it off - but everyone goes through ups and downs in life.  Again, calling it off now is infinitely less problematic than after you marry.

Nobody likes to admit to being wrong about anything - particularly about a public declaration of who the woman is with whom he will vow to spend the rest of his life - but nobody is perfect.

Tired as the cliché may be, it is true that time heals all wounds.  Things might suck for a bit, but this is the end of one (increasingly unpleasant) chapter of your life, not the end of your happiness or chance for better things to come."

**YES**, significantly.

I tend to recognize and memorize most of the smart devices around me and this year was crazy. Nobody I knew from university even heard of the Nexus 4 and nobody cared.

Four of my best friends now own a Nexus 5 and three of them are women. No iPhones, one GSIII, two galaxy aces and one very old sony android, and two dumbphones.

My guess is that my friends bought into the smartphone game one generation earlier at the low-end (Galaxy Ace1) and now realized that they really loved a smartphone, so they got the best one if you're cheap-ish. For 350-400 bucks, there just is no contest. the 8GB iPhone 4S costs that.

I guess it helps that I confirmed that it's a great device, but they didn't know about it from me. They just all asked one time ""okay to get that?"" and then one after the other used it from a friend and fell in love with it. Fascinating.

OP might be able to find some local fly by night tranny guy in his area to rebuild his transmission for $1000. But that's probably with little to no warranty, **and** if OP does the labor of pulling the transmission and putting it back in himself.

Keep in mind that the ex police cruisers also have reinforced frames and the transmission cross member is usually welded to the frame for extra reinforcement. Which requires taking a cutting wheel or torch to the cross member to get it out. I hate working on these things for that very reason. It's an extra hour of labor.

Although OP states the transmission has been out before, so the cross member shouldn't be hard to get out."

""Bryllana, I don't want to remain a virgin for the rest of my life."""
sexandtacos,OkCupid,1390096532.0,"&gt;Why do you use the site? What is its purpose?

Sheer.  Fucking.  Boredom.  For a while it was like ""YAY meet new people, try new things, explore!"" -- this quickly devolved into ""log in, read creepy/uninteresting messages, answer some match questions so I can pretend like someone wants to hear about my life.""  When I get REALLY bored or skeeved...I deactivate.

&gt;How frequently do you come across a person who is worth chatting with?

Maybe once every two months.  Shit has really dried up for me after unsuccessful first date #23 when I really, really stopped caring if I ""chatted"" with anyone...if he doesn't want to meet up within the first 5 messages, I move on and utterly forget about him.

&gt;How frequently do you come across a person who is worth meeting in person?

About the same as the ""chatting with"" option, except that the meeting-in-person plans do not always come to fruition.

&gt;How many time have you met up with people?

I've been on 23 first dates since I signed up in late April/early May.

&gt;Is it a spammy place?

Depends on your definition of ""spam"".  I have not encountered any tinned pork product on OKC, but there have been plenty of gross or threatening messages.

&gt;What are the pros/cons of using this site?

Pros:  potential to meet someone you would not ordinarily encounter in your day-to-day life.  Some people really do have success (I've heard).

Cons:  everything else.  Rude people, threats of physical violence after polite rejection, the motherfucking fade, being catfished in one way or another, risk of taking it too seriously and feeling bummed when stuff doesn't work out...

&gt;Would you say using the site is overall constructive or destructive in terms of building actual relationships? Friendships and serious relationships. A social network, Twitter/Facebook/Reddit type of thing? Are you supposed to use the website lightly and not take interactions seriously? Is this for flings?

I'd prefer it not be for flings, but I seem to be alone on that one in my area among men with whom I'm compatible.  It's possible to make friends through OKC...more on that below.

&gt;Have you had any true successes with making virtual or actual friends/companions with this website?

Yes.  Met someone who has become one of my closest friends/sometime FWB via OKC.  Still the only person I've ever rated 5 stars, and that was before we met in person.  He's a chill dude and a solid friend.

&gt;What are your bad experiences?

Too many to list.  Highlights:  guy who came off very smooth and chatty online could answer nothing but ""yes"" or ""no"" to just about any question I asked in person; the multiple men who've expressed how much fun they had, made tentative second date plans, and then were never heard from again; the one who still contacts me on the regular for sex even though I've turned him down every. single. time; the one who told me that he was emotionally abusive, the one who stood me up...

&gt;What are your good experiences?

The friend I've made and the rules I've set for myself re: dating and standards -- the latter being to have some."

He mentions how the federal government wanted the border to be on the ridge of the Sierra Nevada, but settlers in California had been earlier, mined a lot of gold and became rich. When the Federal Government wanted to introduce them as a state, the land they proposed was rejected by California. Notice how every state is almost the same size west of the Mississippi (bar Texas and Idaho/Montana, but that's a whole other thing). The Government wanted to split California, but California gave an ultimatum. They demanded the whole mountains. The Federal Government conceded they had nothing to bargain with. To show army force, they'd have to go around Tierra Del Fuego or across the Sierra Nevada - which was dangerous in those days even for seasoned travellers.

Now, the government of California could easily gain assistance from European powers, a couple of whom were also involved in land grabbing in the Pacific and Oregon Territory, and the USA really wanted some west coast, so they did what they had to do to secure the area. Let them keep the land. Let them keep the mountains. Let them keep the mineral wealth. The Federal Government couldn't make another deal to appease them.

I'm not saying the country is weak (fuck knows why all the downvotes), but it's true that California was smart and made a good deal to remain a powerful place in the union."

*He emptied the contents of his dick into her.*"
lorelei_,Feminism,1390096877.0,"&gt;My question to you is, I want to do the right thing here. I understand that cat calls are offensive and I look down on people who do the old wolf-whistle out the window as they drive past routine. But, is what I did any different in that sense or is it still as offensive? If it's the same, is there a way that I can compliment someone on their appearance without it being offensive? I would and do the same thing to guys as a straight guy by which I mean to imply that I have non-sexual intentions, just an appreciation of the effort and genetics that goes into making someone look like they do.

I can only comment on this from a personal perspective, obviously, but the short answer is no this wasn't a dick move on your part in either case.

The slightly longer answer is this: complimenting a woman on her physical appearance isn't - in and of itself - a sexist or offensive thing to do. What shifts a compliment from being just a compliment into the realm of dick-ery is context. For a lot of women, if you compliment them whilst leering at their cleavage/legs/$other_body_part then this will immediately get you written off as a creep because it comes across as a) objectifying them and b) trying to hit on them even though they're not interested. Based on what you've said about the latter incident, you didn't do this so you're good. 

As for the former encounter - this is more difficult because women are told by the media to interpret all social interactions with men they don't know via other friends as being sexually motivated and that can lead to massive amounts of misinterpretation re: motives if a man does something like ask them for their number. Whilst I would say that you didn't do anything dick-ish in this situation either, it might be worth (assuming you haven't already) clarifying with the waitress that it's a friends only sort of deal. If nothing else this will avoid any future awkwardness if she has assumed that it is sexual and tries to make a move on you at a later date. 

TL;DR - don't worry about it, you didn't do anything wrong. "

keypuncher,conservatives,1390097040.0,"&gt; Find me a regular, non-NAMBLA style publication for gay men where they advocate having sex with children.

- Journal of Homosexuality, volume 20, numbers 1/2 1990 - a double issue devoted to ""Male Intergenerational Intimacy""

-  In 1995 the homosexual magazine “Guide” said, “We can be proud that the gay movement has been home to the few voices who have had the courage to say out loud that children are naturally sexual” and “deserve the right to sexual expression with whoever they choose. …” The article went on to say: “Instead of fearing being labeled pedophiles, we must proudly proclaim that sex is good, including children’s sexuality … we must do it for the children’s sake.”

- Larry Kramer, the founder of ACT-UP, a noted homosexual activist group, wrote in his book, “Report from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist”: “In those instances where children do have sex with their homosexual elders, be they teachers or anyone else, I submit that often, very often, the child desires the activity, and perhaps even solicits it.”

- Homosexual newspapers and travel publications advertise prominently for countries where boy prostitution is heavy, such as Burma, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

&gt; Furthermore, those male pedophiles often don't identify as gay the same way rapists in prison don't identify as homosexual.

[Per this study](http://www.homosexinfo.org/Sexuality/Pedophilia), among those caught and incarcerated, about 33% of male pedophiles molest boys but not girls.

[Per this study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01542053), about 30% of incarcerated male pedophiles who molest boys self-identify as homosexual.

Lastly, pedophiles, whether they are homosexual or heterosexual, are outliers and don't represent the whole

Homosexuals in general are outliers and don't represent the whole.

&gt; The fact that some male pedophiles are gay doesn't make all gay men pedophiles. To insinuate otherwise as you have just done is pretty offensive to me.

I didn't say all gay men were.  I said the incidence was higher.  Nice strawman though.  Fortunately there is no 'right to not be offended' in the Constitution."

* My first one when I was 12 lasted for 11 days. My mom didn't really say anything because she didn't want to worry me, but I could tell that she (who only has 3-day periods) was wondering if I was broken.

* Maybe a year later I was having bad cramps at school and my dad had to bring me medicine for some reason instead of my mom. He brought me ""Tylenol PM"" instead of ""Tylenol PMS"" and I fell asleep in my food at lunch and then later yelled at my social studies teacher, who, fortunately, allowed me to sleep at my desk. Did I mention that I took the full dosage and only weighed 80 pounds at the time?

* I was staying in a mostly empty dorm one summer in high school and had one so bad that I pulled out a few small chunks of hairs and ripped the collar off the t-shirt I was wearing (I was biting it and pulling on my shirt).

eighthgear,badhistory,1390098244.0,"[Here is a very fascinating State Department document that covers a discussion between Henry Kissinger and the Thai foreign minister in 1975.](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB193/HAK-11-26-75.pdf) It makes several references to how the US wanted the Chinese to have more influence in Cambodia and Laos as a counterbalance to Communist Vietnam. Here are some quotes:

&gt; Secretary Kissinger: ""We would prefer to have Laos and Cambodia aligned with China rather than with North Vietnam. We would try to encourage this if that is what you want.""

&gt; Secretary Kissinger: ""You should also tell the Cambodians that we will be friends with them. They are murderous thugs, but we won't let that stand in our way. We are prepared to improve relations with them.""

[I found that document here.](http://www.yale.edu/cgp/us.html)

Not all commies are the same. In particular, the Sino-Soviet split caused a pretty significant divide in the communist world. As Moscow and Beijing began to see each other as rivals, various other communist states and non-state actors picked sides. Vietnam chose to remain close to the USSR, whilst the Khmer Rouge chose China. The two had cooperated during the Vietnam War, but the Cambodians suspected that the Vietnamese sought to establish hegemony over Cambodia and the region as a whole, and after the Khmer Rouge seized power in Cambodia in 1975, they quickly began to antagonize the newly unified Vietnam through cross-border raids and skirmishes. At the end of 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia, and by 1979 they had conquered much of the nation, establishing a puppet government that would rule for the next ten years.

Given that the United States began to improve its relations with China during the 70s under the Nixon administration, the US did indeed find itself supporting - politically, at least - the Khmer Rouge over the Vietnamese and their Cambodian allies. Democratic Kampuchea, later known as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, which was controlled by the Khmer, retained its seat in the United Nations with the support of the West, despite the fact that they were a government-in-exile.

Pol Pot himself lived in exile in Thailand, and considering that Thailand had good relations with the United States, it is certain that if the US was fine with this arrangement.

In short, the US certainly did not like the Khmer Government, and was aware of its crimes, but the US saw the expansion of Soviet-backed Vietnam's regional influence as the greater evil, and worked to support the Khmer as a counterbalance.

I should clarify that I don't work in the tech world, but I have various friends who do - almost all of whom are male, but that's a discussion for another time - and almost all of whom don't support the use of booth babes. In fact, based on my very limited conversations with them about the topic, they all seem to be of the opinion that a company who uses booth babes to sell their product is probably a company who doesn't really know their shit. Although, that's not to say that all attractive young women in small outfits at tech conventions are automatically stupid/uninformed - I have heard tell of such phenomena as typical booth babes who also know their stuff technically, but I think they're quite rare and mostly get brought out to attract people with T&amp;A rather than the fact that they have specialist knowledge about the product/service their promoting.

Imo, it represents wealth, materials, and goods flowing from new world provinces to historical nations. The result of selling goods back to colonies would have been insignificant from the trade you could make selling them to further european nations.


Now, to represent where this breaks down in EU4, EU4 is not a game based on 100% history. The Cherokee can be a mightier empire than England, with that accomplished goods would have flowed bi-directionally or even in the direction of the Cherokee, this makes the trade lanes incredibly flawed.

Or at least how, contemporarily, the Palestinians are expected to come to the negotiations table with zero preconditions, but have to accept each and every Israeli precondition.

Blissfully,SkincareAddiction,1390098991.0,"Hello my dear. 

My mother when I was younger believed mostly in holistic medicines or natural remedies. Using mostly products with little to no chemicals. 

Anyway I say all that to say, I would try washing with African black soap like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0eI74fS.jpg) and follow up with a deep moisturizer like pure shea butter like [this](http://i.imgur.com/vdn8hfN.jpg). 

My brother had chicken pocks when he was younger and you'd never guess he picked. In the black community we moisturize the heck out of our skin and I believe that helps smooth pores and skin. Of course that would only fix the outer appearance. I would definitely seek help as others have suggested for mental/emotional support. 

There's also a super gentle buffing creamed bar found on Lushusa.com called ""Buffy"" that combines the best of both worlds in the products shown above. But the exfoliating properties are a bit ""harsher"". 

Best of luck!!"

lorelei_,Feminism,1390099069.0,"Interesting question. As with all things, it depends entirely on interpretation of the show and also wider context of the GoT world (and period of real world history that it's based upon).

I know that there's been a lot of hue &amp; cry about the amount of female nudity in the show compared with that of the male cast members as well as a lot of posturing over both the inclusion of Esme Bianco's character (Ros) and the fact that the women in GoT use sex as currency. However, for me this doesn't make the show out and out sexist because of the context of the GoT world and the historical period that it's loosely based on. At that point in time, women had two ways of getting ahead in the world (one if they happened to be commoners) sex &amp; murder - therefore the GoT women using sex to buy themselves power and security isn't as blatantly about male wet dreams as it initially appears. 

The problem, IMO, is more that as a society we interpret the idea of a woman exchanging sex for material gain as a bad thing and something that makes her a victim of the infamous 'patriarchy'. Now whilst is some contexts - e.g. sex trafficking - this is certainly the case, this cannot be applied wholesale to the concept of women using sex to get what they want or need. To me, the women in GoT are not being forced to use sex as currency, they are choosing to do so because they know damn well that this is where their power base lies and frankly, that's a pretty damn empowered decision to make if you ask me. 

Also, not all the female characters are sexualised. Arya for example, isn't being treated as sex object/potential future sex object in the series - and AFAIK this is also the case in the books. Yes, she is only one character and it would be nice to have another kick-ass female character in the show who isn't built up to be the object of lust at some point in her story arc, but actually the fact that she exist at all (given the historical context of GoT) is a bloody miracle so I say celebrate it!"

Renner1,OneY,1390099891.0,"&gt;  The assumption is built into it. You see something you like, and assume they did it for you. That's just silly. 

Where are you getting this personal level from?

I'm not in any way going to assume that someone who's dressed overly revealingly is doing it so that I specifically can see or admire it. I may be missing something in what you wrote, but I don't understand how you think I'm saying ""it's for my enjoyment, specifically"".

I stand by what I actually did say, because I think it's a valid point and is fairly obvious. What other purpose does more-cleavage-then-normal or tight spandex pants serve apart from to show off physical assets?

&gt; And if you can imagine literally no other reason someone might wear scant clothing, you lack either empathy or imagination.

No, I really don't see any other purpose, and I don't think it's unimaginative or non-empathetic to say so.

I don't think ""showing off"" by itself is a negative thing, as long as it's not ridiculously excessive and the person in question doesn't act like being noticed is the same as being viciously gang-raped.

 &gt; And I'm saying this is a mistake. Because you find someone attractive, and they are wearing revealing clothing, does not mean they're doing it for you. It's... I don't know, selfish? Like the only reason people would wear something scant is for your benefit?


I think you're really trying to find something to take issue with where there isn't anything. I'm hardly egotistical enough to even think that ""women who show off are doing it specifically for my enjoyment"".

Maybe if I were in a relationship right now, and the girl in question started putting on a show, of sorts. That sort of thing is different.

&gt; I'm not saying you can't look at people, because that's certainly acceptable. I'm saying ""well, obviously it's what she wants"" is a toxic attitude, and is the thin edge of a wedge. By all means, look and appreciate. But when you start projecting intent, you're messing with someone else's agency. 

Again, I think you're really taking what I wrote and turning it into something that I wasn't actually saying."

&gt; I keep trying to tell myself when I'm not feeling down (which is most of the time) that it's still early in my recovery.

Were you already feeling down? And if I may ask, what's the story behind getting your vasectomy? 

&gt;I did attempt to talk with two urologists but they didn't have much to say and just wanted to put me on more drugs. I just know the penis sensitivity issue isn't psychosomatic, though. I noticed it right away after the procedure.

Are you still taking any medications? Opiate-based painkillers can affect sensation, I found that out later when I had to take them after another surgery (not related to the vas) and sex wasn't quite what it should have been while I was on them. I wasn't in a relationship when I got the vas (I was single for another six months, so I had plenty of time to acclimate and get back to normal before I had a partner), but if I had, I may have been a bit disappointed in post-procedure sex since I didn't know all of this at the time.

PM me if you have any questions or otherwise need to talk about it (like if there are things you don't want to disclose on the boards).

"
S7evyn,rpg,1390100291.0,"If you want to steal from videogame design, a boss is basically a test. You learn various things from previous challenges, and then are required to execute them with skill on the boss.

So, don't focus on making the boss gimmicky. Introduce a gimmick before the boss, use it every now and then, and then dial it up to 11 for the boss.

Example: if you have elite mooks with big shields that have +10 ac from the front, the boss is a big crustacean thing with +25 ac from the front that also reflects spells. Your players will get what they're supposed to do, but the margin for error will be less, so the fight will still feel hard/tense.

EDIT: Dialed up to 11 doesn't just mean a bigger monster; using the shield example, fighting more shield guys than the party could easily manipulate and surround to hit the weak point for massive damage would also be a boss fight. If a party of 5 only ever fought 1 or 2, throwing 3 or 4 at them would be just as hard as the giant enemy crab, and might be more interesting. Alternatively, fighting them in an environment that heavily favors the bad guys could also be a boss fight. If a pair of shield guys are in a hallway just wide enough for them to effectively block off access to their unshielded parts, that's a boss fight (so one 2x2 guy can block off a 4 wide hallway, or two can block off a 7 wide one)."

*How to write good grant applications including some spec applications for people to use as templates - this is harder skill to master than people think.

*How to keep funders engaged with your project/organisation *even if they don't* give you any funding &amp; why this is important.
*Evaluating your work for funders inc example evaluations for different types of project - a lot of organisations fail to realise that a) funders like feedback on their investments and b) that just plain stats doesn't do it any more. Be creative. 

Erm, I think that's it. There's only really so much you can put in a DIY guide for this sort of things as each funder will be different so you generally have to tailor your approach to them rather than other way around.

hrtfthmttr,GirlGamers,1390101213.0,"Well, u/ruteqube almost touches on it before backing away, when he brings up ""authenticity"" of the communication, and u/starfirex actually hits on it with the example with children. Attention is essentially a form of power, at the core. It's what affords you livelihood, influence, and ultimately is the delivery vehicle for your success as a person. We want to have control over our lives, and the first thing we can do is to control the people around us who define most of what we value in that life.

The issues come when the means to secure attention appear far outside the norm of daily social interaction. We draw arbitrary lines about where this is, surely, but we can all point to things that cross that line. Marketing of household goods to kids during cartoons to build life-long brand recognition is a perfect example of something that feels wrong. It's taking control away from individuals in a very biological way, and the motives are very transparent. The same situation if you had a family member pushing a pyramid scheme on you because they want to get rich. The point is that attention that benefits these seekers becomes invasive, and transparently a bid to remove power from you and give it to themselves. What differentiates these from someone writing a persuasive essay is that the medium of attention gathering is centered on the content, not the communication method or elements of the presentation that exist outside the content. Games are the content of the stream, sex is the controlling presentation.

What does this have to do with lying for karma? It's the fact that the producer of the lie is sacrificing all manner of authenticity of the content in order to maximize the end result alone: more power. This is problematic only in so far as we morally feel bad about power for power's sake. And I don't think that's a misplaced argument. 

Why do people accuse without evidence? Because they're reacting to an immediate loss of power and attempting to regain it. There are countless reasons someone might do this. Too many to list, and I'm sure you can think of many on your own."

Ah yes, the old ""All Arab countries are lawless/unstable dystopias"" and ""Arabs society is Wahhabi/Salafi Islamist"" talking points.

An exaggeration on my part, but that's essentially what you're trying to entail. 


&gt; You can bring up things that happened in 1948, so could I. Where does that get us? It just ends with both of us angry.

There's a hell of a lot to bring up that's far more recent then 1948. My point in bringing the early days up was to illustrate, partially, the reason for my ""one-sidedness"" in support for the Palestinians.

&gt; All I know, is both sides are at fault, deeply so,

Bullshit. 

Yes, the Palestinians are at fault for not liking the idea of millions of Jews living in most of the country and taking all of the best, most developed land.

They're at fault for their large-scale ethnic cleansing and displacement at the end of the 1940's in the period 1951-55, and in 1967.

Do you hear yourself talk? 

I may be biased myself, but to say that the Palestinians are ""equally"" at fault as the Israelis for the overall situation sounds pretty disingenuous to me.
 
&gt; And can we not pretend that the ""Palestinian right of return"" means anything but the destruction of The Jewish state of Israel? Because both sides know that's what that means.

Well, it really doesn't-- but if you want them to stop talking about it then what's fair is you end the Jewish ""birthright"" program.

If Palestinian families that lived in Palestine 70 years ago have no right to return to Palestine, then Jewish families who have, at best, a connection eroded by over two thousand years (assuming they are actually of Palestinian Jewish lineage) have absolutely no right to live in Palestine."

The idea behind the film, based on what I read about it before seeing it as much as anything else, is that it is an exploration of female sexuality told through one woman's sexual experiences throughout her life. As far as the point of it goes, I imagine that von Trier wanted to try and push people's buttons - in various ways - by portraying both sex explicitly on screen in a non-porn context and having those sexual encounters come from a female perspective.

Fractions do not come in to play because it is an approximation of time and the statement ""1.5 hundreds of years"" is nonsense. In this context the ""hundreds"" can only be 200 or more years.

Neither of these obviate a label of ""attention whore"". A scientific article extolling the virtues of sterilizing a kitchen sponge to kill bacteria is not the same as a company marketing Pledge during smurfs cartoons because they know the brand loyalty methods work extremely well on children's absorbent psychological states.

Both cases involve a group promoting a possible similar end result, but the motives are far, far different, and the content in the first is much more important than the second. However, the *delivery method* is what clearly defines the incentives, since the advertisement doesn't have to convince anyone of anything to increase their likelihood of making money.

And why is this bad at all? Because I come to look for game content, not to submit to instinctual tendencies for someone to make more money. It's the perversion of my intent into something I wouldn't value in order to benefit someone else that makes this problematic."

Max crosswinds I've regularly landed planes in were full 30-ish knot in both a 172 and Caravan...  about 25 in a Piper Cherokee.

I was instructing at a place that, for the first 3 months, would close the runway that favored the winds. Nearly every day I had to land in 15 knot winds. It built proficiency, which is what got me safe.

I'll have a go at anything up to 30 for that reason.

Straight down the runway, I would be comfortable at 40. Beyond that, good luck taxiing straight in anything light.

Furthermore, it is simply not rational to believe that her wish not to live on life support would extend to pulling the plug at the cost of the life of her child.  It is unconscionable.  For a comparison, imagine she was an organ donor who did not want to live on life support.  Which of her wishes then takes precedence?  Could they keep her on life support until it is possible to harvest her organs?  Or let her die removing that possibility?  That's really the question here.  It is conflicting wishes.  Her wish to be allowed to die is in conflict with her presumed wish to protect her child.  Since it is the family of that child calling for her to be allowed to die, which is also in conflict with the presumed wish of a family to protect their offspring, it seems kinda reasonable to me that the hospital isn't just going for it.

Obviously I'm biased because in her shoes I would want them to save my baby, but I find the debate about ""her wishes"" rather odd given that we can't really know what she would choose."

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1390103157.0,"You still don't have a fucking clue what you are talking about. A different speedometer gear, accumulator spring, separator plate , shifter linkage, etc doesn't make it a completely different transmission.

You're a fucking moron who has no idea about rebuilding transmissions. You take one out one crown vic, and another out of a different crown vic and they're the same exact transmission.

furthermore you're telling OP he's going to get a quality rebuilt transmission for $1000 and that's just untrue. That's really the only reason I responded to you in the first place. It doesn't bother me when people disagree with me, but it bothers me when people who don't know what they are talking about spread bad information.

Everyone on here thinks you're just going to get a quality transmission for $500-1000 dollars. Everyone thinks rebuilt transmissions are so cheap. But the fact of the matter is they are not. Maybe if you want to have someone who doesn't know anything and will only replace what's broken. not give you a warranty, and you have to put the transmission in the car yourself, you might get a transmission for $1000.

It takes a lot of labor and a lot of quality parts to build a transmission that's going to stand the test of time. And you're not going to get that for $1000 or less.

So yes, when someone who doesn't have a fucking clue what they are talking about when it comes to transmissions and tries to tell me that the transmissions I know inside and out and the labor involved with them can be had for $1000, i'm going to call bullshit.

&gt; Transmissions are cataloged during vehicle manufacture according their model number. The difference between different models may be something as simple as a different speedometer gear, a different accumulator spring, or a .001"" difference in a seperator plate orifice. But the model number difference might also signify change something major like a different output shaft, torque converter or shifter linkage.

SentientBagOfWater,AskMen,1390103648.0,"It's a funny thing.  Back in the day, online dating was seen as the option of last resort.  A magic bullet for the nerds, the unattractive, the unwashed and ultimately the undateable to find each other.  Over the years it seems to have become a more socially acceptable thing in most places for ""normal"" people to be involved in, though there is a little remaining stigma.

Based on my personal experience and discussion with friends, I think you've got it the wrong way around.  Men who have terrible luck/skills when it comes to ""real world dating"" seem more likely to continue having problems online.  In addition, some men who do quite well out in the world will fare surprisingly poorly when they go online.  There are others who do well in the world who continue to flourish when they go online and I haven't ever pinned down what makes the difference but I imagine it's to do with how well their positive attributes can be communicated in the profile/pic/message format.

As others have pointed out the ladies you are probably contacting on dating sites are inundated with hopeful messages which makes it more likely for you to be overlooked on criteria that just don't come up the first few times you meet someone in person.

The upshot is that I don't think you can really judge either way.  You might do well, you might struggle, but your online dating experience isn't a good predictor of how it's going to go."

23skiddsy,SubredditDrama,1390104078.0,"The fact is, that it really isn't as simple as that. In my perspective, intersectionality ought to be about how things differ when you meet at certain points, not just stacking oppressions. We can look and see the intersection of being black and male has a TOTALLY different set of problems than being white and male, or being black and female. Being male and gay has different problems than being female and gay.

It's not about the stacking, but how things function for different intersections of things. Which is why as an egalitarian, I think that feminists are completely ignoring intersectionality when they brush off men's issues. You can't claim to be intersectional and not actually look at the intersections going on for, say, male and poor, or male and elderly.

What I enjoy the most about my channel is doing whatever I feel like and knowing the views will come in. What I dislike is the amount of comments I get telling me what to do, granted only about 10% of viewers comment so I generally don't take much out of them unless I get a lot a lot. My big break happened around the time I felt like quitting. I had gotten a (relatively) ton of views/subs over the summer and by the time January hit I had subjected. I honestly felt like giving up. On a whim I did Minecraft: Galacticraft, a series I grew to hate, but ultimately relaunched my channel. When I decided to cancel MG, I thought that was it. I consistently got a ton of views on those videos but I could no longer put myself through making them. I asked for a suggestion to replace the series, and got tons of comments saying Minecraft Comes Alive. Surprisingly, that got even more views than MG. Now, MCA is getting long in the tooth, and the time to end that is upon me. That's my ""success"" story I guess, although I still strive for more &amp; better I'm ok with where I'm at now.

postExistence,AskMen,1390106114.0,"I am trying real hard to think of something to say. I am not going to tell you that you have to work through this. You know that already. You just don't know how.

Assuming the funeral has come and gone, here is what I want to say:

You cannot be by yourself all the time. Build a support group out of your friends, family, in-laws, and your late fiance's friends. They think the world of you. You are their hero. Lesser men would have found a way out of it and cut their losses. It might not seem that big a deal right now, but you *chose* to stay with her knowing it would be painful. And they want to support you. And they probably think by being closer to you they are somehow closer to your late fiance. They probably need you right now.

Also, find a support group. Lots of people go through this, and it can be a good opportunity to listen to other people's stories. It will help you learn you are not alone, and they will want to help you overcome what you've gone through. I think it will also help you put your grief into words, and you can better overcome some of that pain.

This is the hardest part: don't push everybody away. You might not feel up to socializing with other people, but it's so important. You may want to drown in your sorrow and spend the rest of your life thinking about how wonderful your late fiance was. It's easy to just sit alone and reflect on precious memories of you and your love, but that won't make your future better. It will make you feel hollow, attempting to relive the past. It's gone. It's a very, very hard thing to accept. But I think you have the ability to move forward.

I wish what I said will help you find your way. I wish you good luck with the future.

And also, I want to direct you to two important subreddits. The people there are very supportive, and they will help you. Try Cross-posting this question to /r/needadvice. Also, if all else fails, there is /r/suicidewatch. I think you are a very special person. The world needs more people like you. I just hope the tools I've given you can help guide your way."

Cars and housing is an issue, but if one does have liquid wealth on hand, they can whole sale buy if they wish. This is unlikely however, since it would pretty much cause first houses to happen around when the typical person finishes their mortage, and first new cars around the time when the typical person finishes paying off their car. 

Actually the car situation could happen, three years of savings the typical monthly payment can do that. "

Just because they SAY it's never been in an accident, you can't know for sure that you can trust them... And car seats are a one-use kind of deal, like a condom. If it's been in an accident, it's dangerous. You should never take a used car seat from someone that you wouldn't unconditionally trust with your baby's life.

You don't know if they submerged the straps... And if they have, those straps are now unsafe and can't be trusted to hold up in an accident.

Please please please, I'm begging you, acquire a new car seat. Even the cheapest car seats on the market are safe and will protect your kiddo better than one with an unknown history. There are also many places to get a new safe seat for free or for the ""cost"" of taking a lesson with a licensed child passenger safety technician. (And most CPSTs don't charge for their services... It's just a passion. :) There are maybe 5-10 who charge in all of the US.)

If you need further help, please join the FB page ""Car Seats For The Littles"" and tell them about the make/model of your car and your budget, and you'll get wonderful informed help from experts.

And if you can't swing the cost of a new seat or find a good resource for donated seats, PM me. It might take a bit, but I **will** put my money where my mouth is and help out before your due date. Your child's safety and health is my priority, and I won't let finances be the reason he's at risk. :) You wouldn't be the first person I got a car seat for online!

Wardenclyffe56,Advice,1390106908.0,"&gt; it is completely unfair for a victim to feel like she needs to follow her rapist around for the rest of his life to protect everyone else

Agreed. I should've said OP's not obliged to tell the guy's new girlfriend about what this dipshit did, but it'd be cool, at least give her a warning and if she does not want to take OP seriously, then send her on her way, she's on her own.

For example, my sister was sexually abused by my grandfather when she was 12, then he died some years after that. +15 years later, she has recovered herself. During those +15 years, my mother (daughter of my grandfather) found some cousin and updated on eachother's life, and finally, said cousin told my mother my grandfather abused her too. Now, as I think what my grandfather did was extremely bad and sick for a grown man, years of therapy and pills could've been avoided if anyone knew about this (granted, not the same situation, but to give some story I'm familiarized with).

Again, a rape victim **IS NOT** obliged to tell everyone who their rapist was and what they did, but this can save lives and/or prevent new victims, who that, in the possibility they become victims, there's a chance they won't tell anyone about their rapist... and the vicious circle goes on and on and on."

Until now, I expected them to gradually complete the game and come together at a final fight against the black king, following a set storyline of something like say Avatar: The Last Airbender. This showed to me that the story in itself was not going to follow it's own rules and anything could happen.

**Blazing Transfer Student** -- Two episode Gainax OVA heavily inspired by the works of Go Nagai. Prepare for sideburns and manliness.

**Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou** -- Four episode slice-of-life OVA taking place in the post-apocalyptic Japanese countryside. Outstanding animation, wonderful soundtrack. And the manga is even better.

**Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still** -- One of those series that are comprised of a bunch of movies. A super power show where the protagonist's power is owning a giant robo. It has a similar ending to Panty and Stocking. Gorgeous animation, awesome throwback style.

**Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise** -- The first anime Gainax ever produced (not counting the DAICON shorts). My personal favorite sci-fi anime film from the 1980s.

**The Rose of Versailles** -- Raised as a man from birth, Lady Oscar Francois de Jarjeyes leads the French royal guard in the years leading up to the french revolution. In hope you like COURT POLITICS.

**Space Battleship Yamato** -- One of the four most influential sci-fi anime series ever produced. Recently had a remake that I've heard is fucking excellent, though I can't personally vouch for."

James_GAF,TinyHouses,1390107656.0,"Personally, If I could build on the RV trailer I would choose it for the extra space. I'd salvage as much as I can to keep it out of the landfill. Use anything I'd like to keep, sell what I could and donate the rest. Here are some of the questions I think it would be useful to answer for yourself.

How much will it cost you to demolish and dispose of the waste on the RV? Those costs will factor into building on your current platform.

Can you salvage anything inside the RV for reuse? If so that's a value add to keeping the RV for your build.

What will it cost you to refurbish, list and sell your RV? If it's more than $1,500 + demo/disposal costs on the RV you'd be paying to downsize your trailer.

How much will you be moving the new house? I'd expect transportation costs of the smaller 20' trailer to be a fair bit less. The more your drive it, the higher your cost of ownership.

Is the additional costs of ownership and building a larger 32' home worth more to you than the savings going with a 20'? You'd have potentially 60% more interior space. That leaves open quite a few layout possibilities you'd not have on the smaller platform. For instance a full size bathroom. Perhaps even a bed that doesn't require a loft or more room for stairs to the loft space.

Solor,battlefield_4,1390107946.0,"You do realize that there is a drastic difference between software development and your generic office environment when it comes to deadlines right? How often do you see games get delayed? Fairly often. How often do you see Day one patches released? Certainly isn't uncommon in this industry. How often do users encounter relatively major bugs at release? Unfortunately this happens fairly often as well. Look at all the recent major AAA title where a main component involved multi-player, and I'm certain you'll see they all had their problems, or a large majority did. You may also notice that the ones that generally have more issues than others tend to come from the pushy publishers (EA/Activision, etc.)

Back to EA and Dice though. EA is the one that sets the deadline and Dice has to meet that it. Not only do they have to meet the deadline, but they have to stay under budget. They go over budget, they're going to have to start cutting the fat from the company, which ultimately may end up causing even more trouble.

So now we have a company that is trying to balance their deadline with their costs. You may suggest that they hire a few other developers, and even if it was technically possible to do so while staying under budget (for now), it's not as easy as that. The larger your developer base, the more fragmented your code gets. The more fragmented the code is, the more likely you're going to run into issues. So not only does Dice have to worry about the budget and the deadline, but they need to watch their development and keep the fragmentation to a minimum. This is probably another reason why game developers generally work 6-7 days a week, and consistently pull 12+ hour shifts. Work the dev's harder, pay them a bit more for the OT, but you get less fragmentation across the board. It's a balance, and unfortunately Dice couldn't get a solid balance and faltered at the finish line. Had they been given extensions, had EA not given them an unreasonable deadline for the size of the project, then the game would have had a much better release. Hell, even giving them an additional 2 weeks and have it launch to coincide with the next gen release (Nov 15) could have done wonders."

Willravel,TrueAskReddit,1390108092.0,"I's well documented and understood in the behavioral sciences that the key determinant in whether women are aggressive on an individual or societal level is whether or not they are living under patriarchal societal norms. In societies which tend to be less patriarchal, there's a positive relationship with women being active in war, in sport, and demonstrating what we consider to be aggressive tendencies. Native American cultures offer prime examples of this in individuals like Lozen, Fallen Leaf, and Running Eagle, just to name a few. These women were famous warriors, leaders, and one even had two wives. Women being involved in hunting, leadership, war, religious leadership, and medicine was the norm for women in many Native American tribes, even at the same time it was largely unheard of in Europe. It wasn't until these Native American nations were desiccated by disease and then brought under patriarchal European standards that suddenly their women were demure and reserved. 

Women do not inherently lack aggression, violent tendencies, or competitiveness. The idea that women do lack these things is not not basic science, but rather *bad* science. "

mmmsoap,personalfinance,1390108218.0,"After graduating college, I had an apartment with some friends for about 5 years. During that time, my brother got cancer and passed away. About 6 months later I moved back into my parents house for 9-ish months. 

**The good:** bumming around in my 20s, I was living above my means, and that (almost) year helped me get back on track. They didn't know I had any financial issues, but they also didn't charge me any rent. 

My mom fixed up my (other) brother' sold room, which was on the opposite side of the house from their bedroom. I had a semi private entrance through the garage, so I could come and go at all hours without worrying about waking anyone. She also ended up making me lunch a lot for work, since my school doesn't have a cafeteria (the alternative was grabbing takeout, etc). I think she really liked mothering me, and I didn't mind letting her. 

**The bad:** it was really easy to slip back in to old patterns, and at times I felt like a high school kid. Bigger problem, my parents had a *very* hard time remembering that I was a grown up (they still do). They had just lost my brother to cancer, and I was now the youngest. 

There was a built in end date to the whole thing, as they were selling the house so I had to find a new apartment the same time they moved out. I think it would have been a disaster for my mental health, social life, and relationship with my parents if I had state longer than I did, as I would have gotten into a rut where I became that person who *lived* with my parents instead of just crashing there for a few months. That being said, I'm very glad I did it. Getting my debt paid off lifted more stress than I ever thought possible. "

Not_Han_Solo,Netrunner,1390108424.0,"I was playing with 3 Lawyer Up at a tournament today, and did quite well.  When the card was relevant for me, it was incredible.  When it wasn't, it was mediocre at best.  My thoughts on Lawyer Up overall:

Following an Account Siphon with Lawyer Up is absolutely backbreaking.  Every time I did it, I was able to do absolutely whatever I felt like to the corp the next turn, because I had lots of credits and cards to do it with.

I never once re-played Lawyer Up with Same Old Thing, despite having several opportunities to do so.  Having to pay three clicks instead of two makes the card dramatically less attractive.

Lawyer Up has lots of randomly useful utility against Weyland &amp; NBN.  I played it a few times to remove a tag I'd randomly picked up, and even when it only removed one tag, it felt powerful and aggressive.  Similarly, it makes several common pieces of ice, such as Data Raven, MUCH less intimidating.  It was, however, much less useful against HB and Jinteki, because the only way for it to gain value by removing tags was through my own Account Siphons.

Lawyer Up is not an economy card, and cannot replace economy cards.  It's a draw card with a powerful and relevant bonus.  Replacing an economy card with Lawyer Up so seems like a recipe for disaster to me.

When I couldn't/didn't want to Account Siphon the corp and wasn't getting tags otherwise, I wound up discarding Lawyer Up to hand size limits more than once.  Again, when it wasn't removing tags, I found that I always, always had better things to do.

Overall, I like it a lot, but that opinion comes with the aforementioned cautions.  In the right deck, it's a solid card that becomes outstanding in the right matchups.  Those matchups, interestingly, are generally considered to be the strongest corps right now, so take that as you will.

Also, did you want overall commentary on your deck, or just Lawyer Up?"

Finding a partner and having children at 39 is tough. Even if the next guy she goes out with turns out to be the guy she likely wouldn't even conceive until well after her 40th birthday.

Even though you went along with it as a kid, it wasn't your fault - you were doing it to spare yourself the consequences of defying her. It's your parents' fault for allowing her to be ""queen bee"", really. 

The only thing you can do with a person like this is stand your ground and keep saying no. You aren't her doormat and she desperately wants you to be. She made her choices; if she's not happy with them, that's her bed to sleep in. You don't have to be unhappy too just because she is. Like I said, she sounds like a narcissist. You have no reason to feel guilty - you did nothing wrong, you have your own life, their demands are selfish and entirely unreasonable, and the only real reason you feel bad is because she's good at manipulating people into blaming themselves for her childish tantrums. You deserve to be happy; she wants to rob you of that, and if screaming, crying, blaming you, and leaving nasty voicemail for you will do it, that's what she'll do. Don't let her.

rassae,AskReddit,1390109330.0,"Well, I could probably think of a lot of things. But the first one that comes to mind was the first shirt my boyfriend gave me. After our first prom together, he let me borrow it and I never gave it back (oops!!). I took it a lot of places with me because I was still really excited that I had it.

Well, a few months later my town had a huge huge wildfire. I was at my grandmothers house at the time, and we were evacuated. Our car was stuck in traffic and smoke was getting in the car and my lungs were super irritated, so I took that shirt and covered my face with it. Technically it means very little, but for some reason it means a lot to me.

And I suppose that qualifies exactly for your question- I grabbed it as a fire approached the house (the house was fine). I was worried about a lot of things, but that was one of the first things I grabbed.

Maldevinine,australia,1390109518.0,"So, some time spent with the Australian Bureau of Statistics and there is actually some truth to this.

In Australia in most age groups there are more females then males. Assuming that monogamy is the standard and the homosexual portions of the population will cancel each other out that leaves a portion of the females that cannot be in a long term relationship at any one time.

Interestingly, statistics on marriage from the census say that there are more married females then males. Now we don't have polygamy or homosexual marriage, so this must be a reporting error of some sort. Wish I could explain that one.

The point where this becomes a serious problem is where the majority of rural jobs (farming and mining) are overwhelmingly male. Somewhere around 90 to 95% depending on the location. So a female looking for a future moves to a big(ger) city where more typical jobs are available. Females also outnumber males going to university, and so leave home to attend. University is 3 or 4 years of your life during a major developmental period, so social bonds made then tie you to the place where you went to university. The end result is that the population of females is more extremely skewed towards the coast and major centres then the general population. As the article points out large coastal towns can be 60% female, while small mining towns can be 80% male.

So solutions, something the article is notable short on. The first thing is to acknowledge that while this is a problem, it is a problem that we have mostly created for ourselves. As a long term worker in the mining industry across most of the eastern half of the country, I accept that my decisions impact on my ability to date. The rest of the country needs to accept the same thing, even if their limitations are not as strict as mine.

Next I would suggest more effort by state governments to create regional centres which are actually attractive to females and young families. Townsville is a fairly nice place and acts as a support system for the mining further inland. Other cities around the country need to be upgraded and supported to become similar. I'm thinking of Port Hedland first, but either Cobar or West Wylong would make a good one, as well as more investment in Kalgoorlie and Mt Isa.

And lastly, a dedicated campaign over probably two decades to publicise the country lifestyle and show the things that are available in regional areas. I've been a member of more social groups and events here in my reasonable sized NSW town then I was in Adelaide, and I rarely have trouble finding interesting things to do in a break between shifts. For example there's a giant Lego model of the Roman Coliseum in the next town that I'm going to see on Tuesday."

I do not dress, socialize, or behave like either of those stereotypes (though I have most certainly come across them though, and yes I agree the stereotypical 1% outlaw biker gangs give that misogynistic vibe you alluded to), yet I am consistently lumped in with them right off the bat.  After a brief explanation that most riders simply enjoy their hobby and do not associate with a ""lifestyle"", people will understand that it should be categorized more like fishing, boating, or skiing.

In short, I'm not trying to change your mind and tell you to date a rider, but I am trying to say that for most of us this is our hobby, and not a lifestyle culture choice.

Absolutely not. And maybe there's a place for sexualized gamer content. Maybe that place is here. For me, it's the implicit denial that this is sexualized content. The attention this garners is different for a reason, and I do think people are right to ask why. I'm not saying it's wrong, just dishonest in the same way advertising to people's fears provides a psychological barrier that's much harder to overcome than a scientific report on the content.

MR502,AskReddit,1390110693.0,"(Former nightclub security here)

The one thing that stands out was on new years eve 2013, the club was 18+ to enter and 21 to drink. I see each under aged guy get shot down hard by the women for one reason and, one reason only. They want to drink and drink for free. 

So I see this guy who must have done his homework on the place, because this club used color wristbands and the nights color was red. There was no special markings or anything to even prevent what was about to occur. 

This guy struts up to the bar entrance where I'm standing guard. I'm about ready to deny him entry but he shows me the wristband and it's legit. This guy keeps his strut on and goes up to the bar, and that's where the whole act starts to fall apart. 

I keep on watching him from my post knowing something is amiss but I don't he hasn't done anything wrong yet. What I notice is that He's taking forever to order a drink at the bar and doesn't know what to drink. He's a complete noob and keeps the bartender waiting (which is a big F'N mistake) So she's getting pissed off at this guy for wasting her time, every time she comes back to him. 

So she asks for his ID and low and behold she motions for me to step in. ""He's gotta go."" Is all she says, and I escort him out of the club, so watching him go ""Uhhh, ummm, what do you have to drink"" ""I don't know what to drink"" being reported over and over was bad to watch."

OP, if worse comes to worse and you can neither be a non-matriculated student or be apply for as a spring semester transfer for the college you're hoping for, my best advice to you is to attend a class at sister college that is associated with your dream school (like one of the Seven Sisters if you wanted to get into Smith College or another SUNY if you want to get into SUNY Albany, etc.) or do an internship, job or volunteer work related to your major to strengthen your application.

Sahil17,Catholicism,1390111054.0,"There are a few things about the Catholic Church that I find more appealing than Protestantism and other branches.

1. Apostolic Succession: The Church can trace its roots back to Jesus Christ himself. Whether you believe the Church is Jesus's Church still, it was the original one he set up. 

2. Faith and Reason: The Church loves the sciences, with PJP II even saying that evolution is pretty much a scientific fact! Also Gregor Mendel is an amazing Catholic Scientist. He now regarded as the Father of Genetics because of his experiments which form the foundation of Modern Genetics. Also going with reason, the Church generally seems to be more accepting with questions. St. Thomas Aquinas, for example, championed questioning the Faith, because it allows you to grow more in it.

3. The Church is Catholic: Its amazing just how universal the Church is. I currently live in the States but I am going to India this summer, and I could very easily attend a Mass. And it would be just like the one here in America just in the vernacular of whatever region I am in. 

These are just a few but there are many more. However, don't just take my comment. Do some research, read up on some history of the Church in its religious practices and its involvements in the secular world. Whether you end up converting to Catholicism, just learning the history of the Church is very much worth it. "

MasterDignam,gainit,1390111286.0,"Hmm, well, this one's a challenge. I can't really help with programming but here are some suggestions for exercises. Please, no gold, just save the money and invest in a pullup bar and some sandbags/tires.

Shoulders
- handstand pushups are your best bet. ""Kick"" into the wall so that your heels lightly rest against it. These are tough, so you may have to work up from 1, but they are awesome
- military press with a barbell or dumbbell military press until they are too light. If they are too light to start out, stick with handstand pushups

Chest/Tri's
- like above, bench with barbell or dumbbells until they're too light. 
- pushups will be your staple. When these become and endurance exercise (once you can get around 50), switch to ""clap"" pushups (where you explode off the ground for a clap) and even one-handed pushups. 
- for tri's, ""diamond"" pushups, and again as as above, eventually switch to ""claps""

Back
- use that pulldown bar if it's any good, but you're really going to want a pullup bar either at home or to put at that gym
- is that a rowing machine? Awesome. Your main pulling exercise can be sets of rowing sprints for 30 or so seconds. If you want to work your cardio in, just go for longer
- Dumbbell rows, barbell rows. If these get too light, switch to one-handed barbell rows. These are super tough to balance at first, but can be your next level up after regular rows are too easy.

Abs
- super easy, just look on youtube for ab exercises and go to town

Legs/Full Body
- obviously the biggest challenge here. Start with cleans and snatches with the barbell, but that will soon get too easy it seems. Switch to one-handed dumbbell snatches. To be honest, you will not see any leg gains in this ""gym""
- if you live in a hilly region, do hill sprints. These will make your legs much stronger and add size.
- If you have a yard or nearby useable field, buy a couple of heavy sandbags. You'll need to get creative with this, but just carry those sandbags around, lift them and throw them, put them on your shoulders and run with them, do lunges across the field, make like you are a competitive hammerthrower and throw one of them (then run to it, pick it up and throw it again). Squat with them, pick them straight up a throw them over your back. If you don't like sandbags use rocks, and if you don't like rocks use tires, chains, etc. 

To be honest, I would spend at the most 2 days a week in that gym. The equipment is horrible, but more importantly it does not look like a good place to work out psychologically. It looks boring and empty and depressing. I know you want to do bodypart splits but until you move away, that is going to be difficult. If I were you I would do two days a weeks in there doing a push/pull combo and some rowing, two days throwing sandbags and tires around, and one day doing a form of running. Goody luck and think outside the box!"

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390112230.0,"CEO's usually collect most of their pay as stock options, rather than as direct salary, whereas most employees are paid cash (for which in many cases companies do get tax subsidies). 

Different types of compensation have different tax costs.  If you have to pay my company for my management services  then it is a business expense rather than a salary expense, even though I am a one person company that spends 100% of my time working for you in this calendar year.  (Most CEO's don't do that, they actually sit on boards of multiple companies). 

CEO 'pay' is really the fairly complicated compensation agreements that companies make with their executives, and can include things like paying for the CEO's house or private jet or travel or food, or parties etc. etc. etc.  Unless you're a union employee you do actually negotiate your own contract individually with a company.  But of course if you aren't an executive or key employee at risk of leaving the company basically says take it or leave it.

Snort some coke, or whatever drug you've secretly always wanted to try, but were too afraid of consequences. The sea of people surrounding you, eyes locked on the sky.

Humans are not that easily defeated.

We still live!!!

We've known about this planet for years.

We took measures to ensure the survival of our race. There are now colonies, hundreds of colonies in space. Colonies with the most advanced technology in the Solar System. Petty arguments between countries were put aside years ago. There hasn't been a shot fired in war in over 30 years. All resources were devoted to developing new technologies. With this new-found peace, we as a species advanced hundreds of years technologically. The colonies now prosper and seek out new homes. They will find a new Earth.

We will overcome.

eighthgear,anime,1390113397.0,"I guess that's what happens when a studio decides to air a show out of order.

I found Haruhi Suzumiya really strange as well. A lot of people absolutely love it. The two individuals responsible for getting me into anime - my sister and my friend - love it. For me, it's, well, *eh.* The out-of-chronological order thing just seems like a gimmick. *In* chronological order, it makes more sense, but I just don't see why people think that it is brilliant, and why they constantly clamor for more. The show felt like it lacked an overall direction, and it was really carried by the internal monologues of Kyon, who I did like. Haruhi, though, I found to be largely unsympathetic character. Furthermore, she isn't that complex. She is a bored girl whose boredom basically creates bizarre things that Kyon has to navigate. She is a walking plot device, her purpose being to create the premise of each new arc. And that's about it. There were a lot of funny Haruhi moments early on, but by the end, the humour seemed repetitive. Mikuru's purpose seems to be pure, *creepy* fanservice, given that she basically spends most of season one doing nothing and being harassed by Haruhi (one of the reasons why I find Haruhi unsympathetic). Nagato was a pretty flat character, by design, until the movie - which I will admit, was *way* better than either season of the show. Overall, besides Kyon, the only character I liked was Koizumi. Overall, though, I just didn't find enough to like in the show to form any sort of attachment to it."

Worry more about keeping the party buffed and healed, especially in a boss fight. If you have it, and there are no SMN/SCH int he party, use virus cross class on a boss (but only if neither of the above are in the party. Arcanist based classes get a trait that enhances the effects of virus, but once it's used creatures are immune to it for a long while, so it's better to let arcanists use it)"

hakujin214,everymanshouldknow,1390113682.0,"Hiragana is usually used for words that are native or not explicitly loan words (aside from kanji compounds). As far as writing goes, aside from certain slang (いく, to go vs イく, to ""cum"", comes to mind) and loan words, does not differentiate between hiragana and katakana so ねこ and ネコ would be the same thing. Writing in all katakana however would be akin to writing in all caps or unusual spellings, making ネコ into ""CAT"" or ""kat"" and ねこ the more reasonable ""cat"". You'll see it used this way a lot in advertising and manga and other places that'd make use of it. Kanji, on the whole is a lot more formal and sometimes masculine looking. You'll see girls use a lot more hiragana and non-Sinitic words more than boys do. Latin-derived words sound more technical and formal in English, and Sinitic vocabulary in Japanese plays a similar role. 猫、ねこ、ネコ would all be read the same way aloud.

As for kana being derived from Chinese characters: Japanese used to (think over a thousand years ago) be written using Chinese characters phonetically, with no regard to the semantic meaning. The characters used this way were eventually simplified until they resembled modern hiragana and katakana but included many alternative characters (hentai-gana) for each sound. Which characters were used when was determined by aesthetic sense as hiragana was written in a connected style, not dissimilar to cursive in English, making your analogy serendipitously accurate. When the government decided they wanted to modernize, one of the changes they made was to standardize the kana syllabaries. Spellings were further standardized during the American occupation (apparently non-phonetic spellings were ""un-democratic""), leading us to the form and use you see today. You can still see relics of the original use in words like 亜米利加 vs アメリカ vs あめりか (America). That example is anachronistic, but I think it illustrates the relationship between the kana and the characters they were derived from well. 亜→ア、あ. 米→メ、め．利→リ、り．加→カ、か."

keypuncher,conservatives,1390113815.0,"1. ""You are a special little flower"" - that was hyperbole, of course.  The examples he gives after those words are less so.

2. ""Social Security and Medicare will be there for you"" - this is implied by the rabid liberal attacks on any attempt to reform the cost of these programs.  Liberals believe that the math will work itself out somehow, and that they will never actually have to pay the bill.

3. ""Faith isn't relevant anymore"" - I *have* heard liberals say this one - and again, the examples in the article are well-taken.

4. ""The government is your friend"" - if liberals don't believe this, why do they keep pushing for more government, intruding into more of our lives?

5. ""Morality doesn't matter"" - actions speak louder than words.  A Republican politician can be destroyed by a moral failing - Democrats shrug them off and keep on trucking.  It takes repeated, unapologetic moral failings, followed by a news crew following you around capturing how awfully you treat your staff to sink a Democrat's political career nowadays - and 5% of the electorate still voted for Weiner.

6. ""Politicians are investing in your future"" - what do you think the $trillion invested in the ""stimulus"" was, if not this?  How about the $billions invested (and lost) in ""green"" energy projects, if not this?  How about the $billions more invested in the Head Start program, the benefits of which evaporate within 2 years?  How many more $billions are being spent by the Federal Government as incentives to push states into Common Core indoctrination programs?

7. ""The world owes you a living"" - College students are all about how unfair it is that they borrowed and spent 5 or 6 figures getting college degrees and the cushy 6 figure incomes they were promised never materialized.  Many believe it is unfair that they should be expected to pay back the money they borrowed expecting to cash in.  They were told they would get jobs where companies handed them wads of cash just for showing up, and feel very put out that the world is not as they were told it would be.  Welcome to the new Democrat line on envy and greed: ""income inequality"" - where if someone has more than you, it is unjust and they should give it to you.  It doesn't matter if have it because they earned it and you didn't.  This is the theory behind all liberal wealth redistribution programs, from Welfare through Obamacare, to student loan forgiveness."

walkingparadox,Music,1390114983.0,"Recording to tape is a huge deal. You can't get the sound of tape just by fucking around with your EQ. There are a few major differences between recording to tape vs digital. 

Tape has a natural noise floor, where as digital audio has an infinite noise floor (aside from equipments self noise). When tracking to tape you get a really nice smooth compression, or you can slam your inputs and utilize it as an effect. There is also tape saturation, which to my ear is less noticeable but a lot of cats sweat by it. 

The huge one with recording to tape, for me at least, is workflow. You can't sit in pro tools for hours editing sloppy performances to emulate talent, the band actually has to vibe it out and be on top of their shit. You also can't do take after take and save all your work. Most bands record at 15 or 30 inches per second, that gives you 30 or 15 minutes of recording time. A reel of 2"" tape goes for 330 some odd dollars these days. 

In the end, it takes balls, and it takes dedication. It's an artistic choice at the end of the day and a self imposed limitation that really requires forethought and technical ability.

I love your movie pass idea - wish we had something like that here. Given that your goal is to try to be happier, I'd consider sitting down and jotting down what happiness looks like to you, what your ideal ""you"" would be. Doesn't have to be an essay, it can just be a mind map/point form/whatever. Then set some short term goals that will help you move toward that. If you'd like to be more fit, for example, set a goal that for the next month you will work out 2 - 3 times per week. Keep track of your progress (whether checking it off on a calendar, using an app, whatever), and then at the end of the month re-evaluate what worked for you and where you want to improve/move from there and set some new goals. This way you're consistently working toward being where you want to be.


Also, while you are off right now, remember that you want to make use of the time but you don't have to cram everything into this year. You'll be able to take vacations, sabbaticals, etc. in the future too.

http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/01/03/fancy-an-upcoming-tweak-that-colorizes-ios-7/

""Fancy is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that allows users to colorize certain prominent iOS 7 features. This means that you can colorize things like Notification Center, Control Center, banner notifications, Volume HUD, the dock, and more.

Fancy features the ability to set a global tint color that will apply one color to all areas influenced by the tweak. While this is the best way to ensure tint uniformity, some may desire to have different colors of tint apply to different sections of iOS. For instance, you may wish for Control Center to have purple tint, while the Notification Center has yellow tint. That’s totally feasible with Fancy, as long as you take advantage of the individual section overrides.

Included with Fancy is the ability to add color overrides to the following sections:

•Banners

•Notification Center

•Control Center

•Dock

•HUDs

•Spotlight

•Assistant

•Keyboard

Each of these sections can take on any of the following colors:

•Red

•Orange

•Yellow

•Green

•Blue

•Light Blue

•Purple

These colors can be applied as a global tint color, or can apply to the individual sections mentioned above on a section-by-section basis. As you might imagine, none of the tint changes require a user to respring his or her device, the color changes are instantaneous and made in real time.""

Now you'll probably get mad that I'm pointing this out but the joke goes: if a man calls you a horse, you call him an asshole. If another man calls you a horse, you punch him in the nose. But if a third man calls you a horse maybe it's time to start shopping for a saddle. Next time you post, run your text through a word processor for spell check and grammar, make it a little more readable (try reading it out loud and see if you run out of breath), and don't come in with a chip on your shoulder. I'm not pointing this out to be a dick or ruin your day but a post like this would get chewed up and spat out of most auto forums that I frequent. And you'll definitely need their help for something like this so might as well start playing their game.

All that being said, I'll try to lend some guidance anyway.

* Why are you considering running AWD? A lot of added complexity that will probably not aid performance and certainly won't be period correct. It adds at least 3 more custom driveshafts and accompanying CV/universal joints and there are almost no mid-engined AWD layouts to steal parts from. An SBC isn't a bad option as far as cost and parts availability but a 6 speed box will add a lot of cost, while a Tremec T5 is readily available. Also if you're going for the real '60s F1 feel it won't be particularly correct, but neither is two seater so maybe that's not a big deal. The trickiest thing for the mid-engine F1 layout is that the engine puts power down through a transaxle; a gearbox mated to the differential and housing (looks like [this](http://www.duneguide.com/images/SSSS2007/VWBusTransaxle.jpg)). These are not common or cheap transmissions; I spent many hours searching for one to adapt into a friend's Lotus Europa project. The only common places to get a tranny even somewhat similar to this would be a Porsche 924/944/928 or Alfa Alfetta/GTV6/Milano, all rear transaxle cars. The issue with those is they output for the halfshafts at the rear of the box ([Alfa transaxle](http://www.hiperformancestore.com/images/gtv6trans.gif)) instead of the front of the box ([Ford GT40 transaxle](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v668/dvdt/Transmission/FordGTTrans.jpg), this unit costs $14,5000). This moves your whole powertrain forward and all of a sudden is like 5' long, plus seating for two and you have a long long vehicle. Your best option would probably be a motorcycle powered machine. Take something like a Hayabusa motor, easily capable of 170+ hp, and now you have a ready to go lightweight and compact engine with a built in transmission. You only have to worry about a differential, which could be chain drive or the engine could be mounted inline and have a shaft driven diff. The good news is motorcycle engine swaps into cars are becoming popular enough that there are off the shelf differential solutions that have a built in electric motor for reverse (remember the bike tranny won't have it). But expect to pay for a unit like that.

* How much ground up fab are you thinking about doing? If you're talking about fabricating your own suspension and chassis then you'll have to do a lot of engineering to make it even somewhat passable as far as performance (source: FSAE), let alone safety. If you want to go tubular chassis then you'll need TIG welding and lots of it. Let me put it like this; a Formula SAE car is about 400 lbs, 60"" wheelbase, and uses a 600cc motorcycle engine. My team put 5,000 hours of shop time into our car in 2012 and that doesn't include design time. Suspension design is a relatively straightforward engineering process and there's a lot of resources available but get ready to hit the books hard to produce a custom suspension that will be drivable.

* Your much better bet is to recycle the chassis and suspension from a preexisting car. This has long been popular with VW Beetle chassis' but the performance is meh and the rear engine layout won't be very racecar like. It will also always look like a Beetle chassis with a new body slapped on, no way to get around that. As others have suggested you should look into Locost/Westfield or the Exocet, all of which use the Miata running gear and suspension in much more racy bodies."

AngelicMercy,AskWomen,1390119127.0,"Every week on one of his days off my husband drives to McDonald's before they stop selling the breakfast sandwich I like, knowing I won't wake up for another two hours. It's there waiting for me when I wake up and he's just across the room playing video games with his headphones on. When he gets up early for work he tucks me into bed and kisses me goodbye and I love it every time, even when he frets about waking me up. When he's driving us around in the car he's usually holding my hand or resting it on my leg, which I think it really sweet. We hold hands a lot when we're out and when we're watching movies together. 

Then there are times when I'm having issues with PTSD and it doesn't really matter what anyone is saying- extra stimulation just riles me up more because what I need is quiet safety. He has to navigate through that and make sure I'm okay and bear those moments where I'm not kind because I'm in fight mode for whatever I think's coming. He just get's me, it's not easy, but he puts up with my episodes and doesn't make me feel like a crazy person. He is my rock and pulls me back into reality when I'm flinching from ghosts by being there and being patient and guiding me back to the present. He's basically more aware of my moods than I am and checks in when he thinks I'm stressed and tries to make sure that I'm okay or offers help with something. Those moments are priceless to me because I know he truly cares about me and what I'm going through, I know that I can rely on him in a real crises because of the way he handles these little glitches in my brain. His faith in me is sometimes the only faith I have and that is the sweetest thing he could ever give me. It's the most important thing that I can give back to him. 

There a million little sweet things that he does just to make me happy. I have a video of him making funny faces to Thrift Shop from one day when I was working on a sad piece of writing and he kept thinking I was upset so he came over and interrupted me to put that song on and just make me laugh. He looooooooves puns and makes this ridiculous shit eating grin every time! Basically, he is fucking hilarious and knows I have a hard time controlling how I feel, so he's just always making me happy. He's always trying to make me laugh. Too much, I tell him that all the time. I'll be trying to kiss him or have a serious romantic moment and he'll lean in and start giving me those ridiculous little fish kisses. We don't really have those crazy mad passionate kisses, but he usually makes me laugh and there's a lot of giggling involved. (If he made out with my face the way he made out with my vagina I'd stop teasing him, but I think he likes that I even have to say anything like that. I guess I make him laugh too.)

And all of these sweet little things are so special because he's basically kind of an asshole who hates everyone except me. He loves being that guy who hates everything you love, lol. But with me, he's basically a ray of supportive fucking sunshine and I don't know why he's just as addicted to me as I am to him, but I'm wise enough to realize I'm fucking lucky as hell to have such an amazing partner.

xakh,changemyview,1390119230.0,"The goal of it is actually to make high end, powerful gaming hardware functional in the living room. The goal of the Steambox (rather separate from the SteamOS) is to give incentive to developers, not really to gain support by that many new gamers. The goal is simply to get more people developing for Linux, showing them just how simple cross compiling code can be, and that using a system that uses significantly less overhead to run the same systems (performance gains of OpenGL to DirectX are rather high, sometimes doubling performance on identical hardware with comparable settings). The main goal of the SteamBox to a consumer is that it enables a ""set it and forget it"" system to be plugged into your TV, hooked up to the internet, and left there, capable of running however many games you may have in your Steam library that you've gained over the years (I have 159 on mine, about 130 or so of those have Linux support already). In a nutshell, it gives you, your friends, your family, and anyone else who might be in the living room with you a chance to try and play these games that you possess. It's effectively the anti-console, where instead of trying to get one person to play as many games as they can in one way on one specific system, it has a heterogeneous library of hardware, that in turn hooks into 500 available games now, which is constantly growing as older games are ported over, and newer ones are released, at a rate of about 1-3 a day. The goal here is to enable PC gaming to come to the living room, and not just on the antisocial geek's laptop (guilty as charged), but in a way that organically fits in with the rest of a home.

millenialwoman,Fitness,1390119296.0,"as a woman with IBS, I vigorously disagree that this looks like an eating disorder. Unfortunately, for some people, getting healthy control of your digestion is as difficult and time consuming as it is for anorexics and bulimics. My body refused to tolerate almost everything I ate for years, until I was reduced to eating boiled carrot and honeydew melon. It was at that point that I realized that I had to make some changes 

1) Prepare my food every morning and bring it with me, so that I never had to resort to eating the food that was available in public - inevitably food that would make me sick. At this point, cured meats, white bread, most sauces and tomatoes were all making me sick. 

2) Only eat things I knew for certain were safe. Yes, this means eating almost the same thing every day. 

3) Most importantly, ignoring the fuck out of people who criticized my eating habits, accused me of having an eating disorder, or tried to pressure me into eating the food they were eating.

I've been skinny my whole life. I used to eat whatever I wanted-in fact, I sort of felt that I had to, in order to prove to people I didn't have a eating disorder. As it turns out, my body refuses to cooperate when fed that way. Constant diarrhea is a situation you can become eeriely complacent about. Until it's too late and you're bedridden and living off of boiled carrot and honeydew melon. 

OP, I really hope you see this comment and take it seriously. It's really, really dangerous to jump to the conclusion she has an eating disorder and stage some sort of goofy intervention. If she does have IBS, it could further prevent her from taking control of her illness to be accused like that. "

It makes some hormones in your body just skyrocket, to hundreds of times the amount that is naturally produced by your body, specifically estrogen. High estrogen levels have been correlated with breast cancer. 

Personally, I don't take hormonal BC because the amount of estrogen in your body is *so* insane compared to natural levels. My anthropology teacher once showed us a chart of the difference (as off-topic as that was) and it was incredible. I honestly can't imagine that adding such a massive amount of hormone to your body would *not* cause something to happen.. I mean, I guess it causes you to not ovulate, so there's that. It wouldn't shock me if it was more than that, though. Like, fuck, you're tricking your body into not ovulating. Holy shit, right?

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1390120199.0,"There are so many things that makeup can do to change your appearance/make you look younger. Focus on the things that change as you age, some things I've noticed are thinning lips and eyebrows and more pronounced cheekbones. Therefore, to address these concerns I'd avoid dark lipsticks and perhaps use a bit of lip liner to overdraw your lips (Lisa Eldridge has a video on this), fill in your eyebrows, and avoid contouring. I'd also switch over to mainly cream and liquid products as powder can settle into fine lines. 

Brown can be softer than black depending on your natural hair color. For me, I personally rarely use brown unless it's brown black because my hair is naturally black. However, for someone fairer and with blonde hair they might use brown for a more natural look.  

Yes. If they're more arched it would make your face appear more angular and generally round faces are more youthful. If your eyebrows are on the thinner side, that can also be a sign of age."

kowalski71,projectcar,1390120303.0,"Just wanted to throw in a bit of a vote of confidence for you on the rings. Trust me, after the first one the intimidation will go away and it'll just be tedious. As you may know, the whole end gap thing is so that the ring can thermally expand and not interfere with itself but still make a good seal. The ring manufacturer will have some kind of formula based on the material of the rings and how they'll expand. The formula is some multiplier times the bore of the engine, that gives you the desired end gap. Then it's just filing, and dropping the ring into the bore (no piston) and measuring the gap with [feeler gauges](http://www.amazon.com/25025-26-Blade-Master-Feeler-Gauge/dp/B000BYGIR4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390119496&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=feeler+gauges). I usually put my file in a bench vise so I can hold each side of the ring on each side of the file and take them down that way.

Your machine shop will most likely make note of this but in case they don't or you weren't aware: new rings will necessitate breaking the glaze on your cylinder walls. Even removing the original rings should almost always be followed by breaking the glaze and installing new rings, because the old rings will most likely not get installed in the exact same location. The glaze is essentially hardened (Crystallized? Burned? Polymer cross linked? Not sure of the chemical process, tribology isn't my field.) oil on the walls of the bores that develops to match the specific profile of your rings. Your rings will also have some metal shaved off and moved around to match this process. This is part of the 'breaking in' procedure of the engine and aids in maintaining a high compression ratio, which is the source of horsepower and thus all dreams and joy. Low compression ratios and poor piston-cylinder interference is a leading cause of cancer, divorce, and economic collapse. To remove the glaze you'll take some form of hone (diamond ball hone is common but it depends on the specific cylinder wall material or coating), mount it in a power drill, and just run it up and down the bores a few times to mar the surface. Easy, no problem, tons of information on the internet. And if you're super confused you can message me.

From what I'm reading in your comments you're more than capable of this job. And the learning is the fun part anyway!

Some other little tips:

* Get some [shop towels](http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-clark-Corp-75040-Sheets-Towel/dp/B000OAT0RU/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390119730&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=shop+towels) (they're at Home Depot and auto parts stores) and expect to kill a roll or two. When I assemble a little 600cc motorcycle engine I go through almost a roll. Cleanliness is next to ~~godliness~~ horsepower. Latex gloves might be a nice investment as well.

* Since your engine is already disassembled this might not be particularly useful but I dig [magnet trays](http://www.amazon.com/TEKTON-1903-Rectangle-Magnetic-Parts/dp/B000NPXHEI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390120191&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=magnet+tray) for not losing hardware. After everything comes out, or even while it's coming out, I like to take pieces of cardboard and push the hardware through in the approximate bolt pattern it came out. This is really useful for something like a cover that has many pieces of uneven hardware. Then make notes on the cardboard with sharpie of where everything came from.

* If cleanliness is next to godliness than torque specs ARE godliness. A good torque wrench is a great investment, a sheared off bolt in the block is a huge PIA and a bolt coming loose can be quite expensive.

* Mental preparation is surprisingly useful for an engine build, or any unfamiliar complex mechanical process. I like to read through the process in the manual once or twice before I even have the parts in front of me. Take note of the overall order and anything that looks critical. The excitement of having parts in your hands can make you miss a torque spec or something like that. Maybe even write an ordered to do list if you're concerned.

* Building an engine is a crazy satisfying experience, I just walked a new guy on my Formula SAE team through an engine build today (took him 10 hours but it's together) and it's wildly satisfying to have touched every bit of hardware in your mill and see the thing come together. Watch [this awesome video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daVDrGsaDME) for inspiration.

PS: If you're really worried about the rings you can buy [Total Seal gapless rings](http://www.amazon.com/25025-26-Blade-Master-Feeler-Gauge/dp/B000BYGIR4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390119496&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=feeler+gauges), get an increase in piston sealing and thus compression ratio, and not have to worry about gapping them. Still have to break the glaze on your cylinder walls though, not getting out of that one so easy."

Given that he met personally with the Muslim Brotherhood leadership in 2009, when they were still outlawed in Egypt as a terrorist organization, yes.  Particularly given that doing so was a snub to President Mubarak, given that the occasion was a speech he gave in Cairo to which the Brotherhood was invited - meaning that Mubarak could not attend.

&gt; Isn't that theory kind of shot in light of the military coup and repression of the Muslim Brotherhood that Obama has refused to cut military funding for (in violation of US law)?

solo_sysygy,Military,1390121822.0,"The real reason restrictions exist for U.S. Army helicopters: the fuel and hydraulic systems are not designed to operate in high or negative g forces. The UH-60 can use both positive pressure (with pumps) and negative pressure (with no pumps) for its fuel system so it will *probably* continue to work, but the Army didn't want to pay the money to get it tested and certified for those kinds of maneuvers, because it figures they're not really necessary.  There are a lot of additional checks and safeguards (both technical and procedural) that need to be in place to loop around.  Incidentally, one of the Blackhawks that crashed in Afghanistan did so when the crew was demonstrating combat maneuvering flight, and the wheel chocks floated up into the cockpit and got lodged under the collective (which is part of the flight controls).

However, fully articulated rotor systems can support some fairly extreme maneuvers, and if you look online you may be able to find videos of Sikorsky and Boeing experimental test pilots doing loops, rolls, hammerhead stalls, etc. That said, a rigid rotor system (like the one the Lynx has) is even better for crazy maneuvers.

I was filling a syringe with MeMgBr 3.0M in THF, and something clogged the needle. I pulled the plunger more and the syringe detatched from the needle, the back pressure caused the solution to come out of the container through the needle and spray directly in my face. After a few seconds I saw smoke rise off me, and a few seconds later I started violently shaking after realizing what occured. I was quite lucky.

Another time I was doing a 30g scale reaction, and I had all my material in the sep funnel. Well I was staring at it, and the bottom 1/3rd of the glass just snapped and fell off, causing ALL of my material to spill all over my (at the time messy) hood. Took me hours to recover all of it, but managed to get about 70%. It was more annoying cause the reaction is super clean, and I ended up having to do a column on it which I normally wouldn't need to.

When I was an undergrad with a year and a half of experience under my belt I had to do an LAH reduction. Well, it had been a year or so since I had done one. I knew you had to quench it very slow, but I forgot that slow meant a drop. Well I was derpy mcderpface, and I go and take about 2mL or so of water and plop it in (this is a 10g scale or larger reaction). Then the entire contents of the flask bubbles, then leaps forth like mount vesuvious all over everything and frothed onto the floor as well. I then ran around the lab like a doofus freaking out that it would catch on fire. Luckily I mopped it up without event."

TheeLinker,oots,1390122488.0,"[](/ajbook) My theory is that he's mostly making stuff up to mask his real qualms about the situation. 

Namely, that Belkar has been trying to be a good member of the team for some time now, which is something that that doesn't come easy to him whatsoever. He's saved their lives, he hasn't run off when he had the chance, he's worked with them without issue... and despite this, they still don't trust him enough to give him even the benefit of a doubt when he comes crawling around a corner, a sneeze away from death, saying an ally's been taken from them.

And then an *evil, blood-drinking, spawn of darkness* comes around and everyone is instantly willing to accommodate him and be his best friend. The same creature that almost *killed* Belkar.

To you or I, obviously, this all makes sense, since there's extenuating circumstances involved. But Belkar has a basically non-existent sense of empathy and little concept that something like a *vampire* could still contain someone the party cares about. ^(I mean, he's barely able to grasp that *anyone* could be someone the party cares about.) Every day is a personal struggle to hold himself back in order to get the party to accept him (even if only for his own selfish needs) and a creature that literally walks around with evil glowing red eyes has managed to do in minutes what Belkar couldn't in weeks.

It's just a theory, of course. But I'd think that would *sting* for someone like Belkar, and would foster plenty of resentment. Time will tell how right I am, but this is clearly fixin' to come to a head sooner or later..."

The case-of-the-week was also surprisingly good on the whole, because it kept us guessing and wasn't overly predictable. Of course, I did kind of figure it'd be the colonel as soon as we saw him get out of bed and pour himself a drink (proving he wasn't in the hospital), but I still wasn't sure how it'd play out.

More importantly he just gave you all kinds of insecurity issues and trust concerns that are making you nervous. You need to talk to him about those pretty plainly. Communicate how it made you feel. He absolutely disrespected you. There's a difference between not being able to help getting turned on by a thought that tumbled through his head and actually acting out on something. He got caught acting out a bit of fantasy that was inappropriate. He didn't have to be doing that...he chose to and others might want to say let it go, but I would at least talk about it first and find out what the hell was going through his mind that he would go that far. 

Try and work through this together. Let him know he's got some major ass kissing to do and that he needs to make you feel like a fucking princess.

Set up the Assassins as the Katipunan. There you already have assassination plots, and a mentor in the form of Gen. Aguinaldo, like how Machiavelli is to the Italian order. It would play out like Brotherhood's general story, with the Assassins fighting on two fronts: revitalising the people underground, eliminating key Spaniards and guerilla warfare. If Aguinaldo is the sword of the revolution then you're the hidden blade that strikes beforehand.

Hell, take someone from the Spanish Order and bring the Creed here.

With weapons, I would say invent the butterfly knife early on as a replacement for the second hidden blade, and a machete. If we want to be inventive as hell, get the chained scythe that the Japanese have. Muskets are definitely in as a Spanish weapon."

&gt;In the 1980s, at the height of the Cold War, Phil Donahue and Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner co-hosted a series of televised discussions, known as the U.S.–Soviet Space Bridge, among everyday citizens of the Soviet Union and the United States. It was the first event of its kind in broadcasting history: Donahue hosted an audience in an American city while Pozner hosted an audience in a Soviet city, all on one television program. Members of both audiences asked each other questions about both nations.

Aside from the technological factor, Earth is a pretty fantastic world from an Imperial perspective. We are human only and have no alien population, and an ignorant population that would buy into propaganda about 'alien subversives.' Not to mention we don't have any Jedi for them to hunt down.

After a couple of generations of diplomacy, the Imperials would have a fantastic new training world for Stormtroopers like Carida, with very little investment on their part. No need for saber-rattling.

The Empire does have a diplomatic corps, after all.

People who have the skill level to get there but don't have time to play an upwards of 500 games to get there are going to have a bad time. You say it only took 100 games to get there but you went from B4 to S2 (not to belittle at all). For a player that has to go from B1 to something like P2 this is a fuckload of games playing versus players who are likely the same skill level as them (since their MMR remains the same from what I've heard), whereas when you went from B4 to S2 you were playing against B4 players and then progressively more skilled players. Consider also that if they actually belong at whatever MMR they were last season and not *higher*, it's going to get harder and harder to consistently beat players of *similar* skill level if you keep winning games in a row regardless of division.

edit: Yeah I just sat down and glanced over the amount of games needed to promote for perspective. If a person was Plat 2 before, and got placed into Bronze 1, assuming no division skips when promoted (since I cant really predict this in general let alone without knowing the person's situation), and *assuming every single game in between divisions was 100 LP gain*, **that person would need to win 44 games in a row to return to the ranking at which they are actually the same division of the players they would be fighting**."

Gaming is not a sign of addiction. However in his particular case it was probably the forest hiding from the trees, so now that he's not gaming as much as before his attention has turned to something else: sex. Addiction to gaming might be interpreted as something else, but when it comes to sex the inappropriateness becomes glaring. I don't know...does it makes sense? I don't think the sex is the problem, it's his reaction to it. If sex became unavailable, he could find something else  to get addicted to...the same way some struggling recovering alcoholics turn to drugs because they just need to be on something. It's compulsive.

I hope I'm wrong. We're just strangers on the internet, we don't know you guys. I would talk to him and point out that his sexual behavior is worrying. It's not supposed to affect his ability to function at work to that degree IMHO. It's not going to be easy to convince him but he might need therapy.

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1390130593.0,"I'm guessing there's a lot more going on here, history-wise, that isn't begin discussed in this thread.  Am I wrong?  The OP alludes to getting a lot of play outside of the relationship, and you have mentioned wanting to close the relationship when you were having a hard time, but he wanted to remain open so you put a bunch of boundaries/rules on the table to try to deal with it.

In addition to the impulse control issues, I'm wondering if you're resentful from having a long period of time of watching your husband with other women when you were having a really hard time dealing with it, and maybe because of that you feel it's entirely fair for him to have to deal with feelings that bother him wrt your relationship with your bf.  

I also wonder if your husband doesn't want you to break up with your bf because he knows his dry spell will end soon, and he wants you suitably occupied and not feeling insecure when he's getting laid.

edit: I also really don't know if it was a great move for the OP to seek advice knowing you and your bf would read it here.  That move seems somewhat passive aggressive.  It was entirely predictable that you'd get a rash of shit from the posters here, so your husband gets to look like the ""good guy"" for having a well-articulated post and ""forgiving"" you and seeming totally reasonable, but you still get ""punished"" by seeing everyone here call you heartless, awful, etc.

I could be totally off base here, but it seems to me there's a little something deeper going on that helped contribute to this situation."

Sexual activity, for most of us, makes us want more sexual activity.  My husband and I have found that we both want sex more regularly when we're both masturbating regularly, too.  

Based on ""when it get into it, I get really into it"" you  might have a responsive libido.  http://www.thedirtynormal.com/2010/02/27/do-you-know-when-you-want-it/

Are you and your wife OK with her initiating most of the time?  That might be what you require to ""get into it"".  A lot of women desire to be desired though, so this may not be a lasting solution.

At the very least, if you're not in the mood for sex but you know her needs aren't being met, you should be willing to help her get off.  You can give her oral sex, sexual massages, use a vibrator on her, etc.  Assuming this doesn't make her feel worse  - which it might if her issue is not just getting off with you, but wanting to feel desired by you.)"

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390132115.0,"It doesn't make you a bad person, but it isn't neccessarily the best route, either.  Here's why:

1) There's a good chance, if you cheat regularly, that your gf will catch you cheating.  If that happens, she might very likely break up with you, which will affect your access to your kids MORE SO than if you have an amicable split before you cheat.

2) Plenty of kids have parents who aren't together and are fine.  The key is how the parents handle it and how you prioritize your kids above everything.  I don't know the legal situation for unmarried parents in your state, but you should consult a lawyer to see if you have a good shot of getting equal custody of your kids if you were to split up.

3) Kids aren't dumb.  They can tell when their parents don't have a loving relationship, and modeling that for children can have disastrous consequences.  Your kids deserve to see their mom and dad happy, in loving relationships so they know have something healthy to model their own relationships after.  Kids who grow up in a home like yours will suffer from it - I speak from personal experience.

But you're already feeling unwanted, seeing him with another woman, especially if he was way more into her than you, will make you feel like shit, and there's no reason this would make him want you more.

A MMF threesome, on the other hand, would be far more likely to make him want you more, because of the aforementioned sexual jealousy.  But that effect is temporary and really isn't a fix.

Would he be open to swinging?  It might work out well for both of you, provided the jealousy jolt is FUN for both of you, and wouldn't exacerbate existing problems between you."

There's no way to make him change.  If you're not willing to leave, you have to learn to accept that this is how it's going to be.

Also my gut feeling makes me think that he's almost certainly hiding something from you.  I've been in a similar situation and getting angry/upset about masturbation doesn't work (for most people, if they want to have good partnered sex, masturbation helps them keep their libido up, it doesn't make it go away....I had sex with my 37 year old husband yesterday 20 minutes after he'd finished masturbating!).  

It's a sign that he's not interested in sexual intimacy WITH YOU.  It could be he's not attracted to you.  It could be that he's emotionally abusive and keeping you feeling insecure about sex and off balance is a way of controlling you.  It could be he has a fetish or desire that he doesn't believe you're capable of satisfying and that's the only thing he's interested in.  But you're not going to find out what the issue is unless he's honest with you, and this guy has no reason to be honest with you because you've shown you're willing to put up with this situation and you're unwilling to leave."

AkiraZXE,AskReddit,1390133445.0,"Eh? Not who you're responding to, but at least how it works in the US, CRTs aren't obsolete at all. The cable (or antenna) runs into a box, which then runs to the TV. For the antenna, the box can be built-in or not, doesn't matter. The box converts the digital signal into an analogue one, and that's sent to the TV. You actually just change channels on the box, not the TV, a fact that has confused some older members of the population, if my experience with them is typical.

The only way I could see CRTs being obsoleted by a move to digital TV is if there's a digital TV standard in Australia, and all TVs can decode it, meaning you don't use cable/antenna boxes. I have a TV that can supposedly handle some digital signals, so that's what I'm basing that off of, but I've never found a use for that feature. My newer TVs haven't had that feature either.

(All applies to satellite as well.)

Mostly though, I use them for older game consoles. Other than the lack of delay, older games just generally look better on them. Nothing looks worse than a horribly upscaled and filtered texture in an N64 game on your HDTV."

UlgraTheTerrible,bipolar,1390137424.0,"I had quite an extended stay... In and out three times in quick succession (first was for depression while pregnant, they didn't catch the bipolar then)... 

They woke us up for vitals around 8 am... Breakfast/morning meds was at 8:30, but you didn't have to go to meals if you didn't want to. (They did rather insist you took your morning pills) Sometimes they had a half-hearted attempt at group exercise in the morning. 

Saw the psychiatrist between 9 and 11 am if you were awake. 

Lunch was at 12:00.

Supper was at 5:30.

In between was pretty much free reign. They had some crafts and puzzles and paints and games you could use if you felt like it. There was an abundance of old VHS tapes and a TV room, but no cable or antenna, so it was just the movies. 

They also had a full kitchen that was in the common area, and you could give them a list of what you wanted and make practically anything anytime (within reason)... I made brownies and cookies a lot. They checked on you pretty frequently but let you sleep through meals if you wanted (you could always make a sandwich if you missed lunch or something)... I kinda figure they were well familiar with the people coming down from mania needing to catch up on their sleep, and how drowsy the meds make you. 

There was a small patio to smoke on, high cast-iron fence. Had to ask for your cigarettes/lighter, but they pretty much let you out whenever you asked. You could wash clothes if you felt like it. 

Night meds at 10:00. 

Ultimately, it was boring as fuck, but a decent facility, and the staff were often happy to talk. Psych nurses get a little more training than regular ones where I'm from. I wound up sleeping a lot mostly to pass the time.

People saying that Apple could ""patch"" it more easily because it is open-source: ***wrong***. Seriously. It's like the difference between a wrapped hershey's kiss and a hershey's kiss that is already unwrapped. Sure, Apple has to go to a tiny bit more effort (unwrapping a chocolate candy) to get the data - but it's still so incredibly easy for them to see what is happening that it doesn't matter. 


Open Source would be much more helpful than detrimental, in the grand scheme of things. 

Please note that I am neither for nor against this site. In the end, it didn't really help with the jailbreak - the evad3rs were going to release it either way. 

However, they are **not** dirty liars. Everybody knew exactly what it entailed when they donated, and one of their main points was that it had to be opensource. The people behind this site have maintained their stance, and that should be admirable. Even though a pay-for-jailbreak is not ideal (saurik explains this very well in a few other comments), it doesn't mean they aren't allowed to stick by the rules they themselves imposed.

MaeBeWeird,BabyBumps,1390141749.0,"&gt;so what are the odds that I'll handle labor and especially this dreaded, mysterious *transition labor?*

100% chance that transition will not defeat you. Asking for meds is not being defeated. Screaming that you cannot do it is not being defeated.

Transition for me:

As far as ive been educated transition can only come after active labor as it is the final ""push"" to fully dilated by your body.

Most of labor had a break between contractions where there was zero contraction pain and i could relax. During transition, this break went away. It also didnt last more than 15-30 minutes (consider that if you got a kidney stone the pain would be constant and longer than 15-30 minutes before you can get pain meds... and from what ive heard way worse than labor, with no baby at the end, and this doesn't defeat women OR men who go into it without months of preparation)

And then when it ends, everything stops and i get a 15 minute or so break from all contractions (luckily i was with providers who are educated and didnt claim that was sudden labor stalling and try pumping me with drugs or rush me in for c section... it is NORMAL)

And then boom, contractions hit again. But this time my body was pushing baby out each contraction... itself. And i helped push. This is called spontaneous pushing and part of what i contribute to pushing out an 8lb12oz baby without even tiny tears."

IrideTheDirt,Welding,1390141854.0,"Here is the Most detailed yet relevant account of my experience with Everlast. 
I began researching tig machines that would ""do what I need"". Basically I wanted a dual voltage machine (119/220) AC/DC high freq. foot pedal, AC balance control and post flow timer. I also wanted to keep as tight a budget as possible. I found the Everlast Powertig 185 and while the website claimed this machine lacked a few items I wanted, it had almost all of my requirements. 
I kept searching the web looking for reviews. Most of them were old... Complained of stuff like poorly packaged products, or less than stable arcs. I saw welding tips and tricks  review this machine and put it directly against a miller diversion 180. I am familiar with the miller diversion because the shop I work for has one. He basically says they are pretty damn close in performance, but the miller has better low amperage control in AC mode.
True to a point.
Here are my impressions of this machine as a professional welder:

First, I do not believe there to be a better bang for the buck machine out there in this class. Under $1000.00 USD to my door. Including foot pedal, finger switch, torch, gas regulator, a few consumables and the wall plug adaptor for the dual voltage feature. The miller diversion is around $1800, nearly twice as much, and it lacks a few features of the Everlast. 
The reason is, it's manufactured in China, which is where this saga gets a bit more interesting...
My machine arrived seemingly pristine, and I noticed right away features not mentioned on the Everlast site. Post flow time adjustment, and after setting it up, that the foot pedal IS limited by the panel readout. After using the machine for a little bit, I went to put it away, and I heard something rolling around inside the machine. Call to Everlast had their tech Ray on the phone easily and quickly. He said open it up, find them, we will figure out what they came from. ""They ARE made in China he said"". They turned out to be stray screws... Cool no big deal. However while the cover was off I noticed that the tray that holds the transformer, several circuit boards and heat sinks, was bent. The explanation of how this happens is a serious fall landing flat on the bottom, the weight of the components bends the frame on impact. I emailed photos to Ray, and was informed about how it occurs and that he has duplicated the result himself but it takes quite a drop to cause it. I was told that since nothing is touching each other or crushed it should be fine, and indeed this little machine can crank out some amps! Basically, that 5 year warranty has me covered, and that's enough peace of mind for me.

Bottom line: these machines seem excellent, and I am happy with mine, and my experiences dealing with Everlast directly. I've never seen a machine this capable when running on 110! "

Just consider the ideal starting strength progression, you should be able to get to 350 or so lbs in around 4-6 months followed by getting to 500lbs with following TM in another 6-8 months. In an ideal world, of course. 

Mind you, this is hitting Deadlifts for reps. If you want to do a 500lb single you could probably cut a month or two off the ideal estimate."

So what I think is that they should make it so that you actually have to work on your car to make it work.
It also has to be done by visual interaction points like in this mod: http://youtu.be/xwR0mfjwibc
but instead of only entry points, they could be maintainance points such as: sparkplugs, tires, rims, brakes, battery, fuel tank, oil-dipstick, etc.

also there should be ways to mess up a repair job, for instance leaving the batteries attached whilst working on the wiring or changing oil whilst leaving the engine running. A lot of small things to keep in mind.

To make all of this work there needs to be a couple of books explaining how to repair/maintain a car, which can be found in garages or the cars themselves. this will make it so that it requires a certain skillset to repair cars, without any gamy skill-trees.

So we were talking, eating, drinking, and listening to music and we had the same taste in both music and beer. I pulled up a satellite schedule from heavens-above.com and we watched the ISS streak overhead. We eventually get busy in the aft berth. Pretty awesome sex too. Probably the best I've ever had.

redundanteater,bicycling,1390142992.0,"I've looked into this and the physics are a little complicated. What happens is that the weight of the parts that move is very important but only when actively accelerating or de-accelerating, so a weight savings on the wheels or crankset is more meaningful than simply losing body weight sometimes...

Weight is not the whole story though. If one were to save 5 kg off a bike, that would involve a radical upgrade in parts and technologies, e.g. moving from a super heavy square tapered crankset to an external bearing crankset, moving from standard pedals to clipless pedals (which will in turn allow much more efficient leg muscle use). Better bearings will mean that the wheels will coast more efficiently and smoothly, allowing the rider to preserver more energy. 5 kg will mean a much better cassette, a much better set of smoother shifting mechs, tires that inflate to 120 psi and keep their pressure, and so on…

I know this because I've done it. I took my 2011 Trek 8.3 DS from an Acera group set to a Deore XT group set, replaced the Tektro brakes with Avids, replaced the massive bontrager wheels with velocity A23s, replaced the seat, seat post, bars, stem… everything except the frame itself. The change in the bike's rideability is profound. It is faster in acceleration, quicker and more trustworthy in braking, more nimble in turns, rolls more easily. I had been riding the old version of the bike for a year and a half, about 70 miles per week or so. I slowly purchased the new components and when I had the whole group set, I took them into an LBS, the parts were replaced and boom, I was nearly 1/2 hour faster over my 20 mile circuit. That's a dramatic increase in speed. Instead of cruising at 16 mph, I was cruising at 20. Instead of nearly dying going up part of Washington Heights, I made it easily. And it's not like I was slowly losing weight, and the change was gradual. I'm still a very below average guy. I'm 190 at 5'8"", which is fat as far as I'm concerned, and it hasn't changed in two years now. Yeah, my legs are obviously quite strong and my heart works okay, but those things didn't happen overnight.

If anyone says that weight doesn't affect the bike differently than the rider, I think that they're not considering how the quality of parts contributes to speed. Even a more smoothly turning jockey wheel will lessen the effect of friction on the entire system. That should all be obvious. Every part of the bike is important. e.g. those of us with mountain bikes will know how much of a difference there is when we remember to lock out the front suspension when climbing a steep hill on the road.

So yeah… in my anecdotal view, bike weight is hugely important, almost to the point where I almost think some people are being deliberately misleading when they say it isn't."

Not_Han_Solo,Netrunner,1390143991.0,"I'll comment on your runner deck, then your corp, okay?

I'm not a fan of forged activation or emergency shutdown.  I know that they are worlds class cards, and how they are used, but my experience with each has been mediocre at best.  If you are running a tutoring suite for your breakers, I've found that it's just better to put your rig together and face check with cash.  It saves a lot of deck slots and it's what you wanted to do in the long run anyway.

I'd like to see more econ in your runner deck.  As it stands, you're leaning very, very heavily on event econ, as most Andy decks do.  This is a gambit for a big early game, and the price is that if you don't have 4-5 agenda points by the end of turn 10 o so, you're likely to just peter out.  I run a much more long-game Andy deck, and actually won a game yesterday that went so long I drew through my entire deck with Professional Contacts.  Food for thought.

For your corp deck, you're frighteningly light on ice.  The strategy that I've found works best with Wetland is to have a modular strategy: pick two things that the corp can do well, and be ready to do either at a moment's notice.  Right now, you're tag n bag, and that's pretty much it.  If the runner opens with a pair of Plascrete Carapace, you've lost already.  At the same time, you're ignoring a lot of the outstanding ice that Weyland has access to.

I run Weyland Tag n Bag myself, but I do it with 20 ice.  That way, if the runner is ready for my blowing up his apartment complex, I can just build an ice fortress and advance to win, HB style.  I like a lot of your econ; my only suggestion there would be that you might drop Restructure for Cadeuceus; both make you money, but only one also costs the runner cash.  Shadow and Data Raven are also outstanding Ice for Weyland, whether you're running a hard Tag n Bag or if you just want to keep your stuff safe.

The other thing that I've moved to as Wetland is an almost entirely economic agenda suite.  I tried The Cleaners, and never really liked it, and now run Government Contracts instead, which has been great.  Geothermal Fracking has been similarly great for me, and I reccomend the full 3.  The other agenda I've been running, actually, is Posted Bounty, as an in-faction way to push a tag onto the runner.  It allows for double scorched just as well as Sea Source, and can be sacked to Archer if you don't have the kill ready when you score it.

As for your primary strategy with the corp, I'd like to see a third Sea source.  Yeah, it blows to have two in hand, but you absolutely have to have it for the classic kill, and it's safe discard fodder.  I'd also suggest Punitive Counterstrike as well, which generally acts as Scorched 4-6, and has been a solid card for me.

Hope this helps!"

There is a difference in weight, but there's also a huge improvement in fit and ergonomics (which is why I bought it, not for the weight savings). The new saddle is fantastic. It feels so much better, sits directly under my sit bones, and allows better leg motion and riding position. The same goes for my carbon bars. Sure they're a lot lighter, but they fit me better, and have been measured and cut by the mechanics who fit me to the bike.

distinguished-gent,dirtypenpals,1390144344.0,"The system over there is not the same as the one you propose here. Why? Because the interactions that get deltas over there are public. Visible to all. Anyone can see if they agree with the deltas given. It wouldn't be so here. The interactions would be private, with no ability for one to see those interactions. 

Furthermore, those deltas say ""this person made a great and thoughtful comment"" and nothing more. The deltas here would imply ""this person is worth interacting with"" which is terrible. 

Why? Because people will be less likely to attempt to interact with people without deltas making it harder for them to get one. Someone without a delta in CMV simply needs to post an insightful public comment. 

Furthermore, someone who has deltas will be even more swamped and probably less likely to be able to respond to everyone in a timely and appropriate fashion. Given the entitlement that already exists on the men who get mad that they've out in effort to responding to a woman (as if effort were the only factor), we'd only likely see an increase in such entitlement.

Smokeahontas,MakeupAddiction,1390145209.0,"1) I just learned this thanks to r/skincareaddiction. SPFs don't stack. You have to be applying a 1/4 a teaspoon of product on your face for the SPF to be effective, and you aren't applying 1/4 tsp of primer or foundation -- and if you are, STOP. 

That's why it's recommended to wear sunscreen everyday. So what I started doing is applying 1/8 tsp of sunscreen after my moisturizer, let that dry and sink in for a bit, and then apply another 1/8 tsp and let that dry. Then I apply my makeup like normal. 

Head on over to r/skincareaddiction and check out the sidebar for more info on SPF and sunscreen. "

UlgraTheTerrible,raisedbynarcissists,1390145311.0,"Okay. You can't do anything, because you won't. 

You know what you do? You find a friend with a couch you can crash on, you look on craigslist for roommates (and really, the odds that someone on craigslist will be any crazier than your family is slim to none) and you stop thinking that your parents are going to give you anything simply because they do sometimes. 

But this is reality. The only way things will change is if you get out somehow, so you can begin to build your life the way you want. 

When you find a few roommates and a place to rent for an amount that's doable, you get the fuck out. 

Oh, and you stop thinking like you're going to get anything from the sale of the house. You won't. And if you do, it'll be lorded over you for *years*... 

You seem like you're kinda still in the codependent cycle... 

So what will it take for you to break it? If I told you that your very sanity depends on getting out of that situation, would you swallow your pride and live with your father? (Who might or might not help you much, but sounds like he might *at least* let you get some decent rest)

So I guess it comes down to this: You do what you can, and live with the consequences, just like the rest of us. Sometimes there's no easy choice, but I think, for you, the *clear* solution is to do what you need to to get out of that house -- up to, and including finding a better paying job, or multiple roommates to rent a place with you. 

Once you're good and *out*, you can start thinking about visiting a psychiatrist to help you with the issues you've picked up.

Directors are often male nerds so sci-fi/fantasy-films are often very elaborate and well made. Many directors are also into the more arty side of filmmaking so of course the Oscar-contenders and arthouse films are often good. 

But which directors get into film because they really loved all those crappy rom-coms and horror films? A few, but not many. Peter Jackson loves silly horror films, but hasn't touched the stuff since he made it big.

So it's an endless cycle of one genre not getting the attention. Personally I don't mind. Don't care for horror or rom-coms, love sci-fi. Sucks to a fan of those genres though. "

Exactly. Why would he explain to Anderson at all? Only if it served Sherlock's needs:

I think it was for the video camera. I don't think he was trying to impress Anderson, and there may be truth to some portions of that story, but I think it was mostly contrived to be made public on video…perhaps to provoke a response from someone.

Sherlock had been pulled out of his activities dismantling Moriarty's network early, and near the end of Empty Hearse, he tells Watson he doesn't know who was behind the whole terror plot…it's possible that this was a classic ""make the bad guy look like a buffoon, a tool, in public to provoke a reaction out of them"" — whoever the bad guy proves to be.

We could have assumed it was Magnussen, except that he's dead and *coincidentally* the specter of Moriarty shows up? What do the Holmes boys say about coincidence?

Imagine 2nd and 3rd coming in at the same time, and one of them had to dodge the guy, that wouldn't be fair at all. But just running into the masses of people doesn't work, either, because the runners are really exhausted. They need water and some rest, so jumping straight into the masses of people doesn't work. Thus, you show your appreciation of all your fans at the last stretch of the track if your advantage is big enough.

This way just does work best. It's not the first time a runner celebrated before actually winning and it won't be the last. Yes, it's been a bit unfortunate this time, but 2nd place obviously remembered ""fair play""(you can see him slow down even before he got blocked), and that's a big part of this sport. I'd hazard the guess he wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if he would've come in first place, and a lot of people would've seen him as a huge douche."

The very foundation that has always been stressed to me is keeping a regular sleep and eating schedule — because I spent my days in bed, not eating.

If you're function fine on that low level, I'd focus on your therapy and think about the topics discussed there and branch off from that. Just think about it and take notes if anything seems significant.

It seems to me that you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself, which could be problematic — like you said. Don't be too hard on yourself.

But those that did got away with it because of the want for revenge, and they thought that violating women would make up for their villages being burned and their wives and children shot.

Based on my college experience, as well as friends' experiences at different schools, local police don't care to spend the time and resources stopping every house party in a college town when they're not hurting anyone but themselves. 

If the cops do bust a party, they can arrest/ticket (likely ticket) minors for drinking underage. They will also probably ticket the owners of the house for supplying alcohol to minors, and for whatever actually got the cops called to the house (noise ordinance, a bad fight). They won't confiscate the keg, because the person who rented it had to be 21, so they won't take it away.

Gebbeth,funny,1390148226.0,"Ok, let's create a hypothetical situation.

We want to know if Usain Bolt is the fastest man alive.

Let's say he uses doping. Then it would be safe to assume that other top sprinters do too, where top sprinters are the sprinters who make it to the finals and semi-finals. Thus, we get that all sprinters who get to the finals and semi-finals use doping.

Let's say the amount athletes use is normally distributed, where the amount is measured as the effect it has on the body rather than mass of the substance, and there is a threshold at which a runner gets caught. Then Usain Bolt is under that threshold and so are almost all other top sprinters.

On one hand, since he's under that threshold, but no one who's above it can beat him, we can assume he is faster than all the people who use more doping than him. 

On the other hand, since we know all top sprinters use doping, if we take into consideration the human limit, we know that they all use around the same amount. Also, since sprinters who do not get to the top run significantly slower than Usain Bolt, we can assume that if no one was on doping they still wouldn't get close to Bolt's speed. Therefore Usain Bolt is faster than all top sprinters who use an amount under the threshold.

Because Usain Bolt is faster than sprinters that use an amount above the threshold and faster than sprinters that use an amount under the threshold, we can conclude that he is faster than all sprinters.

Thus Usain Bolt is the fastest man alive.

Willravel,TrueAskReddit,1390148503.0,"&gt;These are some ticky-tacky things, but: Women's soccer and most women's sports across the board haven't seen any meteoric rise in popularity. Women's soccer saw a slight boost in popularity in the United States due to our success. When it comes to a world event, Americans (like the residents of most other countries) will jump on any opportunity to root for their representatives. Mia Hamm no longer plays, Hope Solo is exiting her prime, other nations have caught up in skill. As long as we are still near the top, you will continue to hear about Women's soccer in the US whenever the summer olympics roll around, but, the world over, it's a marginal sport.

Yes, I don't think there's a meteoric increase in the popularity of women's sports, rather it's been slow, as far as I know, a gradual increase in popularity. But there is an increase. The biggest change I've seen is in young girls playing sports, especially soccer. 

&gt;Regarding your response to /u/davanillagorilla, I don't question that societal roles play a large part in determining the attitudes of and towards women, but you've gotta provide more than you have. Native American cultures can almost certainly be taken as an outlier. You throw away ""European"" patriarchal society as its own type of outlier, but that disregards the independent creation of patriarchal societies the world over. African, East Asian, Middle Eastern, South American, other American societies, various unaffiliated European societies...most were patriarchal once they had reached their agrarian stages. My current personal beliefs fall in some sort of...sociobiological grey area. I am of the belief that there is some sort of advantageous genetic determinant that gave men an upper-hand at a certain stage in a society and that the opportunity was taken to seize control (this could be that men were better hunters--eh--or that the death rate soared at some point in each society's history (due to drought, famine, whathaveyou) and some sort of greater emphasis was put on the nurturing of children to their own childbearing ages--fathers die, mothers die, but we have to keep the mothers alive to make more mothers, so mothers are tasked with babymaking and babycaring and fathers take on some of the more dangerous roles). Taking the second, more likely possibility into account, look at your statement of Native American women becoming demure--a Native American cultural trait I wasn't aware of, but I will take your word for. Could the rampant disease, threat of war, and potential for agrarian society brought over by the English-French-Dutch-Etc. been the impetus for a change in Native American gender roles as much as European custom 

The Native American populations I described were one example among many, actually. Societies in Southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, some areas of Northern Asia, Southern Africa, and Eastern Europe had less patriarchal societal norms. I don't have my notes with me, but there's a whole list of nearly-egalitarian societies which have existed in human history, and in almost all of them women have been prominent in leadership roles and in combat. It's one of the methods (among many) by which sociologists and archeologists determine how patriarchal a society was. 

Neither, however, was Europe an outlier, in fact patriarchy has been basically the norm for most of recorded human history, and some of it is really, really bad. 

My response to DaVanilla was more about his incredibly lazy post, though. ""Nope, science."" isn't an answer, especially on /r/trueaskreddit. 

&gt;You mean like...the second half of the 16th Century when a woman was the most successful ruler in the history of one of the greatest Empires in the history of the world? That period in Europe?

No, that was great, don't get me wrong, but look at it this way: if Hillary Clinton is elected the next president of the United States, that won't mean the culture in United States suddenly isn't patriarchal, or even that it's much less patriarchal. In fact, if her presidency is anything like that of President Obama, it's going to bring sexism that we largely can't see how out of the woodwork and into the open, much the same as President Obama's presidency has done with racists. It would be a step in the right direction (leaving aside questions of whether or not she's personally the best choice for president), but I doubt it would put us even on par with the Crow society of Native Americans as far as egalitarianism, which is something to be pondered. 

&gt;A lot of this is beside the point, the patriarchy is just such a hot button issue right now, but I feel the discourse on it is a sort of echo-chamber, and I saw this as an opportunity to inject maybe just a slightly dissenting perspective. The issue of why we don't like women's sports is too often kept with in the rhetorical grounds of our own patriarchal society and how to work in to our existing value set an appreciation for women's sports. You cut more to the heart of the matter than most people here by suggesting an issue with our value set and a possibility--or perhaps a need--for a sea change. I think a movement needs to occur, but I think we hold it back if we assume that things things were wrong all along. I think there were justifiable reasons, perhaps wrong in hindsight, that partriarchal systems existed, and the best way of making it beyond those systems is to acknowledge how those reasons are no longer applicable and build a society on a new set of more fitting standards.

I think we should make a distinction between justifying patriarchal societies and understanding why they were patriarchal societies. The latter is sociology and history and archeology, about understanding ourselves and our past. The former, however, is on shaky ground. Put another way, I can't think of any reason to think men and women aren't of equal intrinsic value. A man's life is no more or less important than a woman's. A woman's opinions are no less or more important than a man's. The rights and societal standards we enforce should treat people equally as a default, only being changed for individual issues, like if someone breaks the law or something like that. 

Getting back, sports, I suspect, are one of a whole myriad of indicators as to where things are right now. Granted, physical differences between men and women likely play a role in the popularity difference between men's sports and women's sports, but I do believe there's an aspect of societal gender roles at play, and we can't gloss over that because it makes us uncomfortable (that's not aimed at you, just the thesis of my first post).

Willravel,TrueAskReddit,1390148860.0,"&gt;Look, as a guy, I consider myself a fairly ardent feminist. I'm also a sports fan with a limited amount of free time. In that free time, I have a choice of things to watch, and when I watch women's sports, the quality is almost always about on par with men's high school sports. It's just really not even close to the same quality, and as such I have no interest in wasting my free time watching it.

So you only watch games between the very best teams? Or do you love your own teams and watch their games whether they're doing good or bad? If it's the first one, that's an interesting way of watching sports, one I've not really seen before outside of people who really aren't very big fans of the sport. If it's the second one, then you're not actually watching because of quality, which undercuts your argument a little. 

&gt;This is probably due to a combination of factors, including the potential for strength, quickness, and possibly other factors that aren't yet fully understood. What's clear, though, is that the best women are simply worse than the best men at most physical activities.

We've found a way to deal with this, though, in the form of gender segregation in sports. Almost universally, women compete against women and men compete against men. This is a non-issue, as far as I'm concerned. "

If that really sucks, it's hard to play the game, the sound is quite the same, if they do some weird annoying noises all the time, that game would be destroyed, no matter how good the rest of the game is. If there is only one ugly sprite, which is seen in a few villages, it wouldn't be such a high priority, but this stuff is visible all the time, that way it can ruin the game for a lot of people."

Chinstrap6,AskReddit,1390149240.0,How could I get into this?  I've been working in Oilfield Water Management sense I graduated high school (2 years ago) so I have some experience in treating water- but it isn't potable water.  Every company I've seen requires 2 years of potable water treating experience.  Do you think they'd accept this?

Unfortunately it's very common to have to try different antidepressants and vary the dosage. So don't be too disappointed if it doesn't work initially, just be patient and focus on therapy in the meantime.

Hope you get better soon. :)
