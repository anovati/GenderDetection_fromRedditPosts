Kayge,awesome,1389286389.0,"We had something similar, for my wife and I to officially get married, we needed to have an officiant (Clergy, or in our case Justice of the Peace) do something from a legal standpoint, but the ceremony was done by a friend.  

It made more sense, neither of us are religous, or grew up in the church so there was no church type person who could talk about that.  All we'd get from them would be ""I remember first meeting Kayge and Other half, 3 months ago when they came to my office.""  So it was way more special to the 2 of us to have a friend do it.  It's something we still talk about.

When you hit the early modern period governments started *self-defining.* If your world has *any concept* of nation-states, then you should expect them to *lie.* The Nazis were not socialists, Stalin was not a communist, lots of 'republics' are dictatorships. Spain and Britain are 'Kingdoms' with impotent monarchs. Russia calls itself a 'federation' despite being highly centralized and tight-fisted about territory. And you also have complicated definitions, like Israel, who called itself a ""Jewish and Democratic State"".

metamongoose,AskMen,1389286533.0,"Nothing makes it intrinsically wrong. However, a large age gap and a very young girl brings with it the possibility that the relationship was arrived at through some kind of position of power, either one held by the older man, or one ascribed to him by the younger girl (if she has emotional issues relating to her parents, or was a victim of abuse by older family members). 

In the former, it is very difficult to see how a relationship could form without there being some abuse of power - if he is in a position of authority over her, then naturally she will look up to him, but to take advantage of this is an abuse of power. 

In the latter, the girl is not emotionally mature enough to realise she is projecting other problems onto him, but he is, and if he doesn't prevent it happening, then this is also abusive, as he is taking advantage of her vulnerability.

Both these forms of abuse aren't limited to younger-older relationships, and can happen at all ages. It's just that in this situation it is very unlikely that a relationship will have formed free of anything like this. The fact that people know this will make it doubly difficult, as this kind of relationship will constantly need to be justified and legitimized to family and friends of those involved, which must be a huge strain."

Sir_Dude,AskMen,1389286699.0,"In high school, I was fairly unpopular. 

One day during study hall, I somehow wound up sitting at a table with 3 other people, one of whom was a girl. She wasn't exactly a popularity queen, but she was up there. She was fairly good looking, too (7/10 for high school), but kind of a spiteful and angry personality. 

I can't remember how it started, if I pissed her off, or if she was just in Ultimate Bitch Mode and looking for trouble that day, but she tore into me about my being a nobody, and was my penis only an inch long? And other shit about me being a loser. The other two people at the table (basically her male social equals in HS) just chuckled quietly and uncontrollably the whole time.

I think this was the first time a girl ever made fun of me, I was used to it from other guys, but never with the precision and spitefulness that she had. Never experienced anything like it since. 

I had no idea how to respond, I wanted to slap her, or do something out of anger, but I was too shocked at what she said and the way she spoke about me.

IIRC, I think I just sat there, mouth hanging open, not sure what to say or do. May have gone to another table or ditched study hall.

mycroftar,feminisms,1389286741.0,"One of your other comments in this thread seems to have been deleted, but I typed a response so I'm putting it here!

&gt;...I was recently banned from /r/offmychest too, and not for being an asshole - I was discussing race, and saying that racist remarks aimed at white people is not ""reverse racism"", but actual racism, and one of the mods decided that she was beyond pissed that I could ever think that and banned me. Totally unjustified, and I contacted the mods to tell them so, but no joy. Not everyone who gets banned deserves to! Sometimes moderators abuse their power and let their personal feelings cloud their judgment.

&gt;saying that racist remarks aimed at white people is not ""reverse racism"", but actual racism

Words can have slightly different meanings/definitions in specific academic fields.  Racism is one of those words when it comes to feminism.  

Subs like that exist to facilitate discussion around those definitions and meanings.  You are not coming from the same knowledge base, you haven't made an effort to build the foundation of theory required.  

An fundamental part of racism, from a sociological standpoint, is power.  Without power to back it up, racism is empty.  

The reason you were banned, though?  From the sidebar:

&gt;We have no tolerance for oppressive attitudes, and expect accountability for any oppressive behavior.

By not using that definition of racism, where power dynamics are an important part of whether or not something is racist, and insisting that comments about white people are racist in the same way that comments about people of color are racist...you are invalidating the experiences of PoC who experience actual racism, rooted in power structures, on a daily basis. 

(Not to say that racism against white people is impossible - but in the US, it is nowhere *near* as meaningful or powerful as racism directed at PoC in almost all cases.)"

THE PANTHERS FANS BELIEVE THAT CANTON LOST SOMETHING PRECIOUS: THE ELEMENT OF HARD WORK, OF DETERMINATION, AND OF CHANCE. WHAT IF A TEAM WILLED THEIR WAY TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT ESPN INTENDED?

WE HAVE ENDURED MANY HARDSHIPS TO REACH THIS POINT OF NO RETURN. WE HAVE THE HOPES OF THE 0-FERS RIDING ON US! WE SHALL PAVE THE WAY FOR NEW TEAMS TO STRIKE DOWN THE OLD GUARD OF THE NFL.

TODAY IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE PANTHERS. IT IS ABOUT THE LIONS. IT IS ABOUT THE BROWNS. IT IS ABOUT THE EAGLES. IT IS ABOUT THE JAGUARS. IT IS ABOUT THE CHARGERS. IT IS ABOUT EVERY TEAM WHO'S BEEN TOLD THEY DON'T BELONG. EVERY TEAM THAT'S EVER BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DRAFT IN WEEK 10. 

WE WILL SET THE NEW STANDARD.

LED BY THE EMBODIMENT OF CHANCE, INSPIRED BY COURAGE, AND HARNESSING THE POWER OF THE MYTHICAL, WE SHALL CHARGE FORWARD AND SLAP DOWN THE MIGHTY HANDS THAT OPPOSE US!

dirtyewok,coys,1389287123.0,"i think that absolutely is part of it.

With the current scheme we have been running we are allowing Eriksen to move inside and be forward.  It opens up the left side of the defense that in itself can be difficult to contend with, add in Dawson's lack of pace on the right and by dropping Vlad back you are asking him to be a last man/safety in front of Hugo, his pace allows him to cover a massive amount of ground so he can try to react and deflect an attack that gets by Rose.

Bentaleb played much further up the pitch than i would have expected and you can see the massive amount of space behind Bentaleb and in front of Vlad. Then you see that Walcott was slightly shaded to that side of the pitch, Gnabry was sitting in that space with Rosicky shaded to that side, which would allow them to attack that space. Particularly with Gnabry this looks like an attempt to capitalize on that space whereas against United Valencia/Januzaj looked to exploit Rose more out on the wing. 

I think when we use Sandro you will see him sitting deeper and possibly shading a bit to Rose's side.  This obviously supports Rose but allows you to move Vlad a bit further up the pitch and shade him more towards the middle of the pitch."

CloudDrone,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1389287714.0,"EDM music genres are created with a certain purpose in mind. You wanted to be able to mix records together and match BPM, so to keep with the same vibe and the same tempo, with the limited technology, you would make everything the same tempo and similar drum beat.

Would you criticize Phillip Souzas marches for all being 4 on the floor at 120 BPM? They are created with a purpose in mind. A lot of Jazz would fail miserably at the club, because it can't do what EDM is capable of doing.

I think criticism by comparing the two genres in such a broad way doesn't really bear any fruitful resulting data.

Aint nobody gonna dance to avante garde microtonal free form jazz. But being able to set up expectations with rhythm requires repetition.

But a skilled musician can take the constraints of a form, which is just a suggestion, and play with your expectations in such a way that is simply different than the openness of free form jazz would allow. Some musicians will choose to rely on cliches, no matter what genre, and lower skilled musicians will always treat the same water that the skilled musicians already pioneered.

But cherry picking instances and putting them together for only one genre is not a good way of demonstrating that it exists in EDM more than other genres. Just as someone pointed out with the Axis of awesome 4 chords.

Or How about this video?

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1389287728.0,"I'd tend toward a lot. More like ten. But there's a question of the conception of race. If you've got three races of 'elves,' then they're all likely to interact with on another, and probably also with humans. If one of your races is snake-people, then they and the humans might have instinctive friction and not interact in a friendly way until the early modern period - or at all.

There are hundreds of world religions, but billions and billions fall into [the top ten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups#Largest_religions) - which is an interesting list, because four are Middle Eastern, three of them are from the Indian subcontinent, two of them are practiced almost exclusively by certain countries and people descended from those countries.

Groups that *aren't* interacting will not have the same religions. Where you live is a bigger statistical determinant of your religion than what religion your parents were. Groups coming into contact may have end up having syncretic faiths - Shintoism and Buddhism, Confucianism and Chinese traditional religion and Buddhism, Native American traditional religion and Christianity... there's a huge number of examples.

I'd start from the beginning. Groups which are isolated will develop separate religions. if they're trading or communicating with other groups, they will integrate aspects of other religions and philosophies. But some religions may be compelling enough to dominate political spheres and become global. But that's all dependent on who is politically involved with who.

You might end up with very few big ones with the remnants of folk religions, or you might end up having many enclaves of different religions. Both exist in different parts of the world."

It took an hour or more for the situation to normalize. 

The other was at my Brothers wedding when we all got back to the hotel and she locked me out of the room cause she thought I had been drinking too much and was out of control. I was pretty buzzed but not out of control.  I had to have security come and the cops to open the room which happened to be in my name. The cops asked her 2 questions and made her let me in.

We hear comics talking all the time about how *hard* it is to write jokes, and the concept is just the starting point *because there may be only one or two ways* to present the concept for max humor.  Seems to me all jokes about the same concept, when presented by similarly talented comedians, will tend to converge toward similar presentations.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,feminisms,1389288289.0,"&gt;This is actually backwards--what I've said is prejudice targeting an oppressed group is not the same as prejudice targeting the majority. 

...which means the same thing as what I wrote. And it still means that you are justifying some prejudice while condemning other prejudice, which I find to be an indefensible position.

&gt;If a paramedic shows up at the scene of an accident where a motorcyclist got hit by someone driving a car, should we demand they treat both people's injuries equally? Or should we expect the paramedic to do proper triage, treating the most serious injuries first?

Comparing social ideology to a triage situation is illogical at best. 

&gt;Uh, no. As long as privileged people refuse to treat marginalized people like human brings, it won't end. You can't blame oppression on the oppressed.

Dude, nobody in this discussion is blaming oppression on the oppressed. I do, however, blame racist people for the existence of racism, and I do so with no regard for the colour of their skin. Minorities are capable of perpetuating racism too.

&gt;TIL We're not allowed to resent people who treat us like shit. Good to know.

It's one thing to resent a specific individual who is actively treating you like shit. That's reasonable. It is not, however, reasonable to not only resent that individual, but also every individual who's the same colour or gender as the one who is actively treating you like shit. 

For example, I do not feel that white people who are alive today automatically deserve to be resented by, for example, native people, because not only did none of them take part in the historical oppression of natives, but in many cases their ancestors didn't even live in Canada at that time. Mine didn't. Half of mine didn't even arrive here until after the second world war.

And you're doing it again - you are excusing racist attitudes and remarks from a minority as just ""resentment"" that's justified because they are being treated like shit by those people.

&gt;Yes. That's correct. If you're racist, your opinions about race are worthless. If you're sexist, your opinions about gender are worthless. People who defend oppression don't deserve to be welcome at the table of reasonable discussion.

Obviously, but that's not what I was talking about. I'm talking about people who are not sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. but because their views are a little different from the moderators and the popular kids in the subreddit, they get booted out.

sockmonkeysaurus,relationships,1389288312.0,"&gt; The thing is, I always thought I believed in not changing yourself from someone.

Change can be a good thing. If you're changing drastically for someone, where your personality is completely different to suit theirs, it's not healthy. Part of growing is changing though. You're maturing your thoughts and beliefs and developing your personality more both in and out of relationships. Sometimes though, relationships can get in the way of self-growth, so it can be good to take a step back for a bit, grow as a person, and see if the relationship can work out while at the same time being able to grow as an individual. There needs to be a balance between self-growth and the growth of a relationship. 

&gt; i thought if a couple felt they needed to take a break from each other, then the relationship wouldn't work out in the first place if you can't work on things together.

Taking a break can allow you to reset things, so to speak, and clear your head a little. Sometimes the things you need to work on together can't be resolved with the other person, and have to be resolved within yourself."

phaqueue,WoWGoldMaking,1389288488.0,"Fair enough:

I solo on my Prot Pally and Blood DK, but on a clothie:

Anyone should be able to solo any of the raids up through Black Temple or so (I think BT could be done, might stumble a little depending on the fight) - I'm only going to cover the ones I actually do (for instance, I already have Attumen's mount, so I don't really do Karazhan at all)

some standouts:

**Blackwing Lair**

 Might need help for Razorgore... you need to be able to stand there and take the mobs hitting you (not a big problem) the problem comes in that you need them to be hitting you and not Razorgore... as a pally I find that if I toss on RF and heal Razorgore (you can cast instant heals on him) I get aggro pretty solidly...

Also - the suppression room. My suggestion for this (just figured this out) grab one of the groups of dragonkin from the room before it (down the stairs, there's 2 groups of them) they punt you a long distance. Then make sure they're behind you and face the boss (the room goes down the hall, then you take stairs and turn around and come back so you can see the floors from each other, the boss is actually lined up about with where you start the room at (hard to explain, look at a map or watch someone run it). The dragons will punt you up to the boss through the openings, and you skip the entire suppression room (so you don't have to walk 90% slower forever)

**AQ** 

If you want to kill Viscidious, you need frost damage of some sort (I usually just skip him on my pally honestly).

For Twin Emps, you will just need to out-DPS their heal (did this with an iLVL 450ish blue weapon with a couple cooldowns, shouldn't be a problem for any class)

Also - if you are a class with a pet, you may want to dismiss it before the first boss, he will mind-control - but doesn't do it if you are the only one (pets count as another person)

**Tempest Keep** 

You only really need to kill A'lar and Kael'Thas here (you can skip both of the other bosses) so look to see if you want any loot from them, and if not feel free to skip them. 

For A'lar - I don't even bother to pull the trash in the room anymore, but you might want to clear out some space if you're not a tank class or don't have a way to heal yourself. Also, you will get punted in this fight at least once or twice, make sure you position yourself to not take a ton of fall damage and die...

For Kael'Thas - you don't need to kill the trash here either if you can kill him on his platform. I don't anymore. When I first started I needed the whole room. The easiest way is to kite all the advisors but the mage chick to the back of the room, and put the mage chick up front on Kael's platform. This way, when he rezzes them, you can blow up the mage quickly (she's the most dangerous of the 3) they all have some sort of CC they will try to use on you, hers is a 9 second disorient and generally if she gets it off on you twice or so, you're going to get chain CC'd to death. You want her dead, also a PVP trinket (or human racial) is useful here for the CCs of the advisors. Personally, since I run on a DK and a Pally, I don't pick up any of the legendary weapons, but YMMV depending on your class and what weapons you can use...

**Black Temple**

Not much to be afraid of here... For the first boss - try to kill him before the shield comes out, but even if it does, you can still beat him through it (he heals while it's on, but you should deal enough damage to stay ahead) If you have a pet, you can get spiked, so make sure to dismiss your pet for this fight.

On Reliquary of Souls, his phase 2 will kill you if you're not careful - you take damage for the damage you deal, so you can't just blow him up quickly. You will need to throttle and use and self-healing you have to stay alive. (You also lose max mana during this phase, so don't take too long - never had that become a problem though)

The Trash before Mother Sharaz can stun you - so don't pull it all at once or be prepared to possibly watch your character slowly slapped to death...

For the council, the pally will BoP other members and the priest will heal. They share a health pool, so just focus one for the most part (cleave/diseases/etc on the others do help though) if you can't survive, kite the paladin up around the ramp and behind them then back down around the outside of the room until they die. You can easily outrace the heal if you keep dealing damage (again, did this with a weapon left over from leveling, like 2.5k DPS weapon or so) depending on your DPS and self-healing abilities you can just stand there and burn them down (I recommend focusing the pally because he never casts BoP on himself

Illidan isn't tough for the most part, except the flames. Save all your cooldowns for this and blow them up as fast as possible. They don't really hit hard unless they enrage. If you're a mage or ranged class, max range them and blow them up as quickly as you can, if you're melee, pick one and wreck it, then drag the other back to his blade (they do more damage when they're farther away from the blade)

These are the ones I can think of that I've done that anyone should be able to do... TK can literally be done in under a 1/2 hour easily if you skip the 2 middle bosses and just do A'lar and Kael'Thas... Black Temple takes a bit, Aq takes a while just because it's a LOT of running...

Hope this helps! Any questions or want to tag along on a run to see how it works - hit me up on bnet (phaqueue#1767)"

Why are you concerned about her weight? Is it for her appearance or are you worried about her health? If you truly love her, then you should look at her appearance and weight last, it's what's inside that matters.

Now if you are worried about her health, and you lead an active lifestyle, then talk to her about ""her health"". Don't use the words weight, overweight or anything like that. Suggest fun activities that are active that you two can do together; going to the gym, hiking, etc. Cook healthier meals together.

People who reach their thirties without ever having suffered a crisis of vocation scare the hell out of me. Imagine being born into this world and never having a problem with anything you see. *Shudder.* College is one place where you can learn to be critical of all the things your world is trying to get you to believe.

That being said, you're correct that not enough students take that next important step, which is to figure out how to make their newly discovered selves a part of their society. This is a tough step for English majors in particular, because the sorts of books they're reading along the way do a fair job of convincing them that that society is corrupt and pernicious. They envision themselves as revolutionaries against or at least as conscientious objectors to the world of money and empire. 

What's easy to forget is that even revolutionaries make their compromises with the status quo. Those English majors who are ambitious and creative figure out ways to work for things they believe in without starving: they join non-profits, they become teachers, they start good food movements, etc. But too many of those who never put thought to the future end up just working less lucrative versions of the corporate dronedom all their friends from ""practical"" majors are doing, which is unfortunate."

When the Doctor has background knowledge of things he suddenly remembers at the end of an episode to save the day, it nullifies him as being a protagonist.

Once more, this has nothing to do with the focus of the show, who has the most screen time, who has the most impact on the story, etc. It is more of a thematic point.

Japanese leadership refused surrender at the advice of Japanese military heads like  Soemu Toyoda, who told the emperor that even though america had one nuke, they could not have any more.  This is aided by the fact that the first nuke dropped *before* the soviet union declared war on japan.  Even once the Soviet Union attacked Manchuria, Hirohito told his advisors to ""handle"" the situation rather than demanding peace."
streakybacon,Games,1389289286.0,"&gt;  Rezogun is good example of the type of particles I am talking about. Just generic particles.
&gt; We need better particles!

[Resogun actually uses Voxels](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-vs-resogun) (think 3D pixel) for it's environment:

&gt; Housemarque's approach in realising the digital carnage is intriguing: environments are created from hundreds of thousands of cubes, each of which is individually animated by GPU-accelerated physics.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The entire environment - everything - is built up from these voxels,"" explains Kruger. **""All of the cubes that you see flying around - there's no gimmick, no point sprites, it's not a particle effect, they're actual physical cubes.** In gameplay, dynamic cubes with collisions, floating around, you can get up to 200,000. Our engine supports up to 500,000 but in actual gameplay scenarios, it rarely goes over 200K."""

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389289303.0,"&gt; A lot of dating profiles read like rants about that person's past relationships.

Ugh, that is annoying. If someone walked up to me in a bar and started ranting about their past relationship experiences, I would be turned off. Why wouldn't someone assume the same from a dating profile? I know some of the conventions are different online (since you can list your dating preferences outright online but not so much in person), but it just seems like positivity should be a given when you're trying to attract people.

And I still have to question someone who is consistently dating actual assholes and crazy people. Either they jump into relationships way too quickly, they're attracting the wrong people somehow, or they jump to those conclusions far too easily. I can understand getting lots of weird one-off messages, but if everyone you choose to actually connect with has the same thing wrong with them then the common factor is most likely you."

S-Flo,Games,1389289555.0,"I have to disagree with your assessment of Final Fantasy XII attempting to remove control from the player (although I'd say you're right that XIII did try to remove control with the dumb auto-battle thing).

Final Fantasy XII actually gave you more control over your characters than any game in the series. I mean, they allowed you to [completely program the AI of your party members from the ground up.](http://i.imgur.com/CKYbhJL.jpg) You can also issue direct commands to any character at any time that take priority over Gambits or disable a character's Gambits altogether.

It got especially interesting with difficult boss fights (particularly in the optional content), the fights themselves were too difficult and hectic for the player to be able to keep track of more than one character's commands at any given moment. To win you had to experiment with different gambit setups, and even after you had a winning setup for that boss you constantly have to provide input to keep your party alive as the fight inevitably went awry.

Sure, your characters would plow through weak enemies with little to no input from you, but what are you missing out on? In more traditional turn-based games, you typically just sit there mashing **X** over and over until you've attacked enough to kill the mooks that just popped up in the random encounter. The real interesting encounters (things that require strategic thinking on the part of the player) in both types of games are typically things like bosses. Hell, most dungeons in these types of games are just challenges in resource-management (can you make it through this area without expending all of your MP and healing items?), not difficult combat.

XII just gave you the option of programming an AI that could mash **X** for you. You still have to manage resources accordingly to survive and bosses are still challenging encounters that require your complete attention to win."

Like some of the other users have mentioned, some girls are like that too. I was one of them, not too long ago. The notion of a relationship can be scary. Commitment can be scary, especially if you aren't sure if you're 'ready' AKA if you are unsure of yourself, your life, or the other party involved. I swear though, there are people out there who will want to a relationship, not all attractive men are pump-and-dump types, and even if they are, the novelty and excitement of it tends to wear off after a while. 

Casual sex is different than emotionally involved, relationship sex. Living the carefree, single life, is definitely different. Some people prefer to explore their options, some people prefer to find someone who's stable and wants exclusivity. 

Keep your chin up, OP, you'll find your guy - just don't settle being a casual relationship just because you really like someone. You should only get yourself involved with someone if both of you are completely comfortable with the terms of the relationship. Keep dating, the guys you want exist, I swear.

**TL;DR - Some people prefer casual, some prefer exclusive committed relationships. There's a broad spectrum of choices out there - make sure you don't compromise your values for someone else's.** "

I tried paleo not because everyone else was doing it, but because I liked the idea of eating unprocessed food - and to me, white flour seems processed. I'm definitely skeptical of some of the paleo philosophies (I just don't believe rice, peanuts, or beans to be THAT bad) but I dropped 25 pounds in 3 months doing paleo 80% of the time and 4x week crossfit.

hrtfthmttr,sex,1389290025.0,"&gt;It will also be interesting to see what the rates of male compliance are- as the article mentions women already often miss x3 pills in a month.  Men, being more risk tolerant and generally less compliant, may miss more.  Since male fertility is 'always on' and not 'maybe' like female fertility, this may be an issue depending on how the possible solution interacts with missing a dose.

It's really freaking frustrating when people comment and clearly have not read the article. It's not a pill, it's a device, and it doesn't have any scheduled maintenance. It's a single injection good for 10 years.

Not even to mention, all of your criticisms can be said about the pill for women, including the moral hazard argument (it's happening right now with the morning after pill). Would you argue that these methods shouldn't have been funded at all, then? No.

Quit regurgitating Catholic propaganda and think for yourself a little, *after* actually doing the required reading.

Johnzsmith,wicked_edge,1389290677.0,"The biggest single issue as many have explained, is the drying nature of canned creams.  Due to the propellents used to make them squirt out in an aerosol form, canned creams can end up being drying on the skin.

Now, with that being said, IF you properly moisturize before and after your shave, you should really have any issues with drying.  IF you don't have sensitive skin, you probably won't have any issues with drying.  IF you value convenience over tradition, you probably won't mind the minor drying effects of the canned cream.

The bottom line really comes down to preference.  I love my shaving soaps, creams, and sticks.  I love my boar, badger, and horse hair brushes.  I love the ritual of the shave.  HOWEVER, sometimes I wake up late and don't have the extra few minutes it takes to shave properly, yet I still need to be shaved.  These are the mornings I still grab that can of Edge Gel.  It doesn't happen very often, but it is not like it turns my world upside down when it does.

I have no idea what it costs to buy/make cloth diapers initially these days though so factor that in.  When I did the math with my son the price difference wasn't what everyone seemed to think.  People just seem to ignore the ongoing costs of the cloth diapers and the cost of the disposables they used occasionally when comparing.

For me the cost savings is not sufficient to justify the extra work.  Handling them while soiled, the added laundry, the occasional stripping, it just wasn't worth it.  But I will not stay home so that is a major factor in my decision.  My husband and I both have sensitive skin and we did have some trial and error finding brands we like but ultimately had no issues with skin irritation (I love baby bottom butter).  Also, nobody disposes of the poop in the toilet like you're supposed to.  Just nobody.  Which is a major factor in the convenience of disposables."

What you are thinking of is the Focal Character (character who has the spotlight). In 99% of stories, yes, the Protagonist is also the Focal Character, but they do not need to be the same. Sherlock Holmes (the novels, NOT the shows/movies) is a prime example of this. In fact, that is one of the things the books are known for. Protagonist: Watson, FC: Holmes. This is a well known literary case, not me saying this. Doctor Who on the other hand is me speculating, yes.

I have definitely noticed a shift towards what you are talking about. In more recent episodes, the Doctor has taken on both roles as Protagonist and Focal Character, which I believe (and is pure extrapolation/opinion!) is a large part of why so many fans are disgruntled by recent episodes (yes, 90% of the fanbase loves the show more than ever, but not what I am talking about right now :)."

Things like: If your testicles haven't shrunk in size significantly and are still firm, you have no difficulty in getting or maintaining erections, you have a reasonable sex drive, etc. Then it is more likely that you would be able to produce viable sperm, since these are evidence of higher testosterone levels/functioning gonads.

Glance at him to make sure he's actually checking me out, then look away, then look back to see if he's still checking me out, then keep doing what I'm doing because I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do about this particular scenario. That's the default.

If I were interested and not feeling totally awkward, I'd meet his gaze, smile, and maybe raise my eyebrows or something.

If I were not interested and also feeling awkward I would attempt to get myself out of his line of sight somehow, which would probably involve trying to turn my body in such a way that I both can't notice him and am not giving him a view of my butt...which would be awkward and difficult.

If I were not interested and feeling not awkward, I would look back at him, give him a smile with a little roll of the eyes (of the friendly/teasing kind), and then look away.

Therapy won't fix him. He's damaged, and if you stay, you will be too. Now is your chance to leave - you have no kids with him, you can see that his behaviour is dangerous, and right now he isn't as abusive as he will be. This is your chance. You *have* to leave him and you have to do it now, because when he escalates it will be much harder. Right now he hasn't isolated you from your family and friends. Right now he hasn't got you convinced that the abuse is all your fault, although when you say ""It's not just him"" it feels like you are halfway there (nobody is perfect but that doesn't make his behaviour justified or reasonable or acceptable!). But that won't always be the case. He will decimate you with his words. he will make you hate yourself and have you convinced that you deserve this and could not do better than him. He will break your body along with your soul. IT'S NOT OKAY. It's not fixable. You need to get out NOW. It's not worth sticking around."

Bad posture likely contributes by basically compressing your chest cavity (and the viscera in it) for long periods of time. Muscle pains and aches also happen, and you're probably not getting the best blood circulation with extremely bad posture.

How would you feel if the right-wing packed the courts and started ""interpreting"" things like reversing Roe v Wade, etc?  There's really nothing stopping this from happening, structurally.  Thankfully the courts tend to honor precedent but there is no law that they have to.

This is why, as a proponent of democracy and the rule of law, I find the idea of activist judges abhorrent.  These judges are accountable to no one, and they should think long and hard before settling important legal questions of the day.

However, differences in location and behavior create ""walls"" that officially separate them. Subspecies don't tend to have these walls. 

And then you have things like ring species...

But differences between subspecies largely have no major phenotypical differences, unlike the hybrids of different species that remain fertile. (A Serval looks radically different than a domestic cat, but two subspecies of wolf generally have similar appearances, behaviors, and anatomy.)

gazork_chumble_spuzz,feminisms,1389292460.0,"&gt;If a bullied child strikes back at their bully, they have both engaged in bad behavior, but they are not equally to blame.

So native people who tell their kids not to play with their white neighbour because he's white are just practicing some form of self-defense, much like a child who's hitting back at his bully. Right. If that is reasonable to you, I don't even know what to say.

Do you not see that those people are perpetuating racism in the lives of their kids by telling them things like that? It isn't a case of ""hitting back"" because *they aren't being hit*, especially not by that lonely white kid in particular. Can you not see that it is racist to treat people in that fashion? Can you not see that ""your skin looks like the skin of people who have oppressed us so we're doing to hate you"" just isn't reasonable?

&gt;the existence of racism (as an act of oppression) is not the fault of minorities. It's the fault of the dominant group.

Those minorities may not be oppressing the dominant group, but that doesn't mean they are not capable of perpetuating racial prejudice, mistrust, and hate. Oppression is not the only thing that matters or that is worthy of eradication. Hate matters too, and it doesn't matter how small a minority you belong to, you are still capable of hatred and of perpetuating that hatred. It should not be overlooked or excused because ""it could be worse"".

&gt;You really must not think oppression exists if the only thing you can think about is ""historical oppression"" in the case of ""ancestors.""

That's an odd thing to say in response to my words. Do you think that white people automatically deserve to be regarded with suspicion and resentment just because they're white, due to history and its effects on modern-day society? Because I don't. I think it is unreasonable to be frustrated with a system and take that out on individuals. I think it's unreasonable to dislike people who have given you no reason to do so other than the fact that you don't like their skin.

DevilGuy,SubredditDrama,1389292842.0,"maybe, but the alternative is no one shovels the street, you can't get a snowplow in since there's too many parked cars, an no one's going to get out there with a shovel in the morning if they can't reasonably expect a parking spot when they get home.

The whole thing with the chairs and objects reserving spaces is just what people came up with to make sure others aren't unfairly taking advantage in the absence of any official protection.

I see a lot of sanctimonious people talking about how the whole thing with saving parking spaces is bullshit, but the reality is it's just people saying ""don't take advantage of me"". It'd be one thing if that was california (where I live) and there was literally zero work involved in maintaining your patch of sidewalk (note: if you own property you're responsible for maintaining the sidewalk) but that isn't the case, if you're in chigago, or anywhere it snows heavily really, every open spot that isn't a giant pile of snow is someone's hard work. The real problem is that there isn't enough parking, and some people *will* take advantage of their neighbors work and get offended when you call them on it, probably a lot of people acting offended in that thread are acting that way because they know damn well their guilty of taking advantage of others and don't want to face up to it.

So, the OP there is guilty of overreacting, but that's it, ethically, there's nothing wrong with his contention that since he did the work of clearing that patch of space for parking, that he should have priority over parking there."

Describing 11's era is delicate, for there is a hell of a lot that it got right. Smith was an amazing actor. Many story beats were hit. The character grew and evolved. But acknowledging the hiccups and errors of the show does not diminish any of those. Bringing up what did not work does not impact what did work what so ever. Elements can be 10/10 while other are 2/10. There were definitely things that could have been done better, and better to an extent that they have become an elephant in the room."

Sit down in a quite place, close your eyes.  Breathe in for 5 seconds.  Hold for 5 seconds, and release for 5 seconds.  The actual amount of time is arbitrary, do whatever is comfortable for you.  The goal is to simply focus on the breathing and only the breathing.

If your mind wanders, don't get mad at yourself, just make a mental note, ""my mind just wandered to thinking about arguing with my friend"" and then bring your focus back to your breathing."

As OP already noted, they appear rather suddenly.  Also, they have a language and culture distinct from the Canaanites.

&gt;Noete: just to check, Palestine and Philistin are quite close. So they they must have a common origin, right?

Indeed.  When the Philistines were integrated into Canaanite society, the entire area became known as some version of ""Palestine"" to Greek and Roman authors as a geographic term.  After the Jewish revolt of 135CE, the Roman province of Iudaea was renamed ""Palestina"", which formalized the term."

I like the silent alarm, and sleep tracking, though it took some getting used to to wear it to bed. 

It's kind of a passive motivator, since it sends you a report every week telling you what day you were the laziest.

I don't use the food tracker, because I personally find it an unhealthy experience. My friend tracks food though, and says the library of available food in the database is pretty limited. She syncs it to another service (mynetdiary) you can also sync it with some other popular services. Fitbit lets you eat back some of your calories based on your activity level, which is probably helpful for people who use this feature.

Johnzsmith,wicked_edge,1389294222.0,"Boar brushes tend to smell pretty funky when they are new.  This isn't harmful or unusual, it is just the way they are.  When I get a new brush, regardless of whether it is boar, or badger, or horse, I will first soak it for half an hour or so in some nice hot tap water.  Sometimes after such a soak you will notice that your soak water is now tinted yellow brown.  Glad that didn't make it to my face.

Next, I take some shampoo and really work it into the brush.  Then, I let it sit for half an hour or so with the shampoo on it.  Then I rinse.

Next, I take some conditioner and work it in as well.  No need to get expensive, just use whatever you use on your own head.  After working it in deep into the brush, I will let it sit for an hour or two, sometimes overnight if I am not in a hurry.  Then I rinse.

At this point, you should notice that the brush feels a little softer than before and has mostly gotten rid of its dead animal smell.  If it is still a little funky after all of this, I will soak it again in the hot tap water, only this time I will add a little bit (a tablespoon or two) of white vinegar.  Let it sit in the vinegar solution for an hour or two and then rinse.  If you don't want to use vinegar, you can use Borax.  Either one will help cut down the odors and soften the bristles.  Now your brush is ready to use and should smell a lot less offensive.  Regular use will take care of any residual odor.

Every 6 months or so, I repeat this process with all my brushes.  As I use them, water deposits and a bit of soap scum tends to build up on the base of the knot near the handle.  If this goes on long enough, the brush loses some of its ability to properly build lather.  By stripping these deposits you restore your brushes ability to do its job properly.

Good luck!"

But usually you have some level of medical supervision by at least 12 weeks to rely on if something is not right, and it doesn't sound like you do.

13 lbs is not a lot, but your body has added weight as your placenta develops and baby grows, so it actually represents a greater loss of body mass in some form than what you see on the scale.  For that reason it is best to talk to a doctor and monitor your health to be sure that if there are any red flags you can address them.

If you've got a phone that has GSM, it may be capable of use with a SIM on there though it will need to be carrier unlocked.

Pageplus uses the Verizon network and you can get as cheap as $0.04 per min/text on prepaid. Generally 3g verizon branded phones that are clean can be activated online for free by some online resellers and programmed over the air. Data is expensive, but can be disabled along with MMS(also data) within the account settings. With this the less you use the less expensive it become, though if you're needing lots of talk and text an unlimited plan through an MVNO(virtual companies that use big networks to deliver service) you're very likely to spend less.

For a trans person, they are *born* feeling a certain gender. The problem comes in that their body does not match what their brains are telling them. 

Studies have shown that the brains of trans people resemble the brains of the gender the trans people feel they are. A male who feels that she is a woman has a woman's brain, for example.

Transition, the physical changes the body goes through via hormones and surgery, is not changing the person to something. It is changing the body to match who and what that person has always been.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,feminisms,1389294971.0,"&gt; You keep conflating the general with the specific, which is not conducive to mutual understanding.

The general is made of the specific. When you look close at the general it consists of individuals.

&gt; It's perfectly right and acceptable for oppressed groups to feel resentment over being oppressed.

Of course it is. My problem is when people take that resentment and aim it at *individuals* and make ugly comments *at them*. 

&gt;This means the solution to that problem isn't to play to the fallacy of the golden mean and attack both sides for being hateful (ignoring the very real power discrepancy that exists and disproportionately harms the marginalized)--it's to undo the oppression.

Why can we not do both simultaneously?

&gt;but it isn't ""racism"" because ""racism"" is an act of oppression,

We are never going to agree on this definition. I reject it as too limiting. You think it's apt. There's no reconciling that."

Terrorism isn't as much of a threat to america as the media, the government, and the the like would have us suspect.  Bigger threats are things like large corporations and the rich lobbying the government to influence policy to help them profit.  See the cutting of funding for things like nasa and food stamps while corporate subsidies (which were already something like twice as large as welfare) continue unabated.

aDDnTN,nashville,1389295751.0,"http://www.nashvillemta.org/Nashville-MTA-Maps-and-Schedules.asp

there is a link. with a quick look i see the following routes going in and out of GH: 2, 7, 21, and the #8 is not too far (on bicycle).

Honestly, you will probably want a car to get around nashville. It's not as bad as houston (as far as the necessity of owning a car), but the MTA is by no means comprehensive or complete. And for any trips after 10pm (maybe as late as 11pm, if everything is running right) you will want a car/motorcycle or you will have to take a taxi.

But the #7 runs ever 20 mins during working hours and every 40 mins before/after that. But with at least 3 buses coming near GH every 15 mins or so, you should be fine.

FYI, the bus is $1.70 one way or 5.25 for a day pass. The fares are priced for the system to be self-supporting and not rely entirely on gov't funds, so it isn't super cheap, but it's certainly better than nothing. http://www.nashvillemta.org/Nashville-MTA-bus-fares.asp

My guess is that charger you just took to the nearest bonfire that i hope is not your house is charging your Lithium battery as a NI-MH/NI-CD battery.

The Doctor has taken over as the sole protagonist, and now provides the narrative and the focus. As I agreed to in the previous post, the doctor **was one** of the protagonists, but not the only one. Now I will address your points in greater detail, I did not mean to offend! I am open to having my opinion changed, I love discussing writing styles and elements of the show deeper then its plot points and continuity!

&gt;The Doctor is the only consistent character in the show's fifty year run. He regenerates, yes, but his core personality is always the same. The Doctor is constant, his companions aren't.

He is a living setting. The focus of the story. A constant.

&gt;The Doctor tends to be the deciding factor in where the adventure is taking place. Occasionally he'll ask a companion what they want to do or where/when they want to go, but most episodes start out with the Doctor introducing his companions to the locale of the week.

The driving force of the story.

&gt;The reoccurring villains all pretty much target the doctor. They are the Antagonists, the Doctor is the Protagonist. The Daleks never shrieked in fear of Rose Tyler, they mobilize entire armies when the Doctor is around.

An antagonist is whatever provides an obstacle by which the protagonist can gain character develop meant. It does not need to be a person, or even actively against the protagonist, merely a device for the protagonist to overcome. Sometimes the antagonist is a good guy, and the protagonist is a bad guy, as in Macbeth. It is a widely used convention for a good protagonist to be pitted against an evil antagonist. Keyword: Convention.

&gt;The companions don't get specials. There isn't The old companions or Day of the Companions. There's The Three Doctors and Day of the Doctor.

Refer to first point.

&gt;Meta: The Doctor always gets top credits. When the names swoop in during the theme song Tom Baker came in first, then Elisabeth Sladen. David Tennant then Billie Piper.

Once more: convention.

Now for my ""evidence"" (can I call it reasoning? Evidence is such a condescending term. It make me feel like I am at war with you.)

* If a new (in this case novel or unencountered situation) obstacle (antagonist) is encountered, the audience (viewers) needs a character who also does not know anything about this novel situation. If there is not one, then writers must use forced exposition, which comes across as clunky (show don't tell, see Star Wars: Phantom Menace). The viewers naturally tend to grow a bond with this character, and it is known as the protagonist. All of this is used to create an organic feeling experience in which the universe feels alive. Like it is not something that is written, but living and breathing. This is good, traditional writing. Other methods can, and often are, used. Though the bond tends to give a focus bias, clever writing can be used to shift the focus to other characters, even though the exposition is still being given to a different character (known as the Narrative Character, a sub class of Protagonist)
* How does this apply to Doctor Who? The companions *usually* know nothing about the TARDIS (""Its bigger on the inside? Whaa?""), and thus make a natural stand in for the viewer. The easiest route is to make them the way through which exposition can be organically given.
* The Doctor, by definition, knows a massive amount about the universe. About science. About time. About things we could not possibly comprehend. Exposition would be forced and clunky if it was explained to him. Why would he need to be told something if he already knows about it? The way around this is if it is a novel situation.
* Notice how Season 6 has a twisty turny, timey wimey plot? It was to keep every situation new and fresh to the Doctor, to prevent him from having random knowledge he could throw at the episode (which would kill the audience stand in bond). By this point in the show, he has become the main protagonist, both narrative and focus wise. This is all well and good, but one must be careful not to let the story become convoluted.
* Season 7 did the same thing with Clara. The Doctor was given a mystery at the same time as us, the viewer. This once more allowed for him to become sole protagonist. He had no knowledge of Clara, we had no knowledge of Clara. Everything he found out about her happened on screen, at the very same time as we learned about her. Due to this, Clara had an air of mystery around her which gave the sense that she knew something the audience did not, thus disallowing her from becoming a protagonist.

By season 7 you are most definitely correct, the Doctor **is** the protagonist."

bechampions,soccer,1389295954.0,"In that case, the idea of national teams is an antiquated remnant from the old world and are practically pointless

Edit: Let my clarify my point. If guys like Costa, Deco, Eduardo, etc. Are refusing to play for the country of their birth, where they were raised both literally and culturally, for a country of superior economic resources (Spain, Portugal, Croatia, etc.) Then that means that these countries hold an unfair advantage in terms of recruiting players and in turn, international football will resemble club football with the best players representing the nations that give them the best economic opportunities. 

As things stand right now, the lines are pretty blurred with the vast amounts of immigration occurring throughout the world with players like Ozil, Zlatan, Nasri, etc. born in the countries they represent being the children of immigrants. But at the very least, these guys are born and raised with the culture of the country they represent, they grew up in a footballing sense, in that country. 

Theoretically, you can have an entire national team represented by 11 Diego Costas and it would be a false representation of the country's footballing strength and national identity, which is what makes international football so fun and interesting. A national team of 11 Diego Costas would be a club team and would defeat the purpose of international football."

Also, that argument is simply not valid because Akira did not create BOG, the latest canonical installment. And BOG is still canon. (Also, he didn't create Episode Of Bardock neither, and it's still canon.) With BOG he simply edited to make it more family-friendly after they approached him with the movie. He deemed it too dark at first.

This is all documented facts so no matter how hard you die-hard GT-haters stomp your feet, it's not gonna make GT non-canon."

Misinformation or not no one can tell them they have to take your add. In fact I bet you could ask them to advertise a pool noodle and they would still be right to reject your add. Noting you can do about that.

So what Google has done is taken a stance of well these could be eventually under all the same laws as leafy green tobacco products. So instead of having to refund millions maybe even billions of dollars for adds if or when e-cigs become ruled tobacco products they took the safe road that prevents lot's of refunds, lots of lost revenue from a lack of adds, and the rush to refill lost adds.

There are more reasons there than GOOGLE IS MISINFORMED. No they are proceeding with caution. Google may be very pro vapes once they are regulated properly. However Google has also chosen very wisely to not partake in hosting vape and e-cig adds."

TerminalStar,EatingDisorders,1389296486.0,"I think I fit into the kind of person you're asking after: I'm on a waiting list for professional treatment (got a message about it earlier, might be happening soon! :D) but my anorexia and bulimia have definitely quietened down over the past few years. I don't think it'll ever be possible to call myself healed, or to say I've completely overcome these issues, let alone based on the progress I've managed - but I am at a point where I'm not suffering lots of physical side effects and I definitely eat more.

The first thing I remember really getting to me is when I first started dating my last boyfriend. He said he'd done some research on bulimia, and had read up about the side effects. As a result, he asked me to stop; the look on his face and tone of his voice broke my heart, he was so worried I'd end up with some real, permanent physical problems that I couldn't bear to keep on. So, I made a real effort to become healthier, mentally.

You've started working out what your triggers are, which is great. It's the best first step. Other than trying to control that, I found it helped to keep myself busy. No time to sit and think ""I've eaten X calories today, ugh, that's way too much, I need to purge"", instead realising you're about to go down that path and saying no. As soon as I get those thoughts, I'll find something, anything, to do. Sometimes it's even just getting up and walking round my flat!

Even if you find it hard to learn to love yourself, learn to be at peace with yourself. This isn't something I can really explain how to do, but basically I've gotten to a stage where I hate the way I look, but it is what it is. I  may not like my body, but my health is more important. My parents are getting older, I need to get through university, I have too much relying on me being healthy and able to function.

A third thing that (hopefully) can specifically help with bulimia and binge/purge cycles is to not have food you can binge on in the house. Fancy some chocolate? Get a small, single serving bar instead of a big one you'll be tempted to binge on later. This applies even more if there were specific foods you used for binging; I wouldn't be surprised if you consider those a trigger!

As well as you can, just be nice to yourself. I still find that really, *really* hard, but we are our biggest critics, I think especially when it comes to physical features. I do encourage you to pursue professional treatment when you can, but good luck in kicking bulimia's arse by yourself. :)"

rmigz,leagueoflegends,1389296621.0,"TBH, if the pay were competitive, I would consider taking a job as a manager in the e-Sports industry.

The problem is that e-Sports do not offer a viable career path for educated, experienced managers.  I don't know much about the pay, but I can't imagine it would be competitive with other *""real world""* careers.  It also doesn't seem like there would be much job security when you see the high turnover at the organizational level; seems like several multi-gaming organizations go belly up before they get a chance to grow.

I used to compete in e-Sports years ago when CS 1.6 was still a highly competitive game, so I have the passion.  I'm not saying I'm up for a job or anything, but the only organizations I would accept a position with are TSM, EG, coL, CLG and possibly C9.  Crs seems volatile, I'm not sure what to think of XD.GG and I don't know much about Dignitas.

There would have to be some financial transparency from the hiring organization for me to take the job considering that this is a budding industry and these are relatively young organizations when compared to traditional career paths available to trained, educated and experienced professionals.

Edit:  Forgot to add EG, they've been doing this a long time.  I would also consider coL since I know Jason Lake has been doing this for a very long time, however, I'm not sure how he treats his employees.

To expand on how I consider a job opportunity, being someone who is currently a manager in the finance industry, I tend to peel back the onion a bit and try to understand the financial stability of a potential employer.  This type of research isn't really available for e-Sports organizations as they don't have established credit profiles, ratings or any type of financial reporting that could be available to the public through reporting systems like Moody's, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Standard &amp; Poor's, etc."

prettyladythrowaway,asktransgender,1389296687.0,"I just decided one day that I'd had enough and went full time with little preparation and only going outside presenting female a couple of times before.

In retrospect, I wish I had done more to prepare myself.  I looked like a girl but going from not going out at all to going out all the time meant I didn't get a chance to build up any nuance.  That kept me from passing or at least looking good enough to elicit positive responses from people.  I would get a lot of weird looks when interacting with people and most compliments centered around me being brave.  Luckily though, I was mostly ignored by people when just walking around on the bus or whatever.

It took a long time to get the social stuff more down, to get the clothes down, to get the hair down etc.  Now things are a lot better and I'm getting a lot more positive attention and compliments.  Hardly any weird looks ever.

Another thing that's happened is being presented with social situations that I've never had to deal with before.  Like other women acting really openly around me in public situations.  There was a whole lot of me thinking 'what's appropriate for me to do in this situation?' 

I also had weird situations where women were snotty to me until they found out I was trans and then they became a lot friendlier.  I think it was because, in retrospect, I was dressing like someone who had no idea what she was doing.  Women judge each other for what they are wearing a lot.  That was a major adjustment.

The lowest lows mostly came from when I thought I was passing well then getting misgendered.  

And that's the other thing, it's actually kind of really hard to tell if you're passing (as a white, middle class person).  Nobody gives actual feedback.  Almost no stranger says explicitly mean or misgendering things.  Friends aren't likely to tell you either way.  Along with the huge bias in perception you and anyone you ask for feedback may have.

DreadfulRauw,AskMen,1389296761.0,"Jesus, let's see.

I've done a lot of the dominant bondage/bdsm stuff I was interested in.  Not necessarily every specific scenario, but similar ones.  

Anal is good, but overrated in practice, I think.

Blowjob while I'm drinking a beer and playing a video game: check.

I try not to let fantasies fester too long.  I've got willing partners.  So far the ones I've not really had a chance to indulge in are:

A fair amount of my more submissive BDSM fantasies.  Most of my partners tend to be more submissive themselves, and I'm a switch, so I usually end up taking the dominant role.

Playing a game/having a contest where you win the other person for the evening.  I like the idea of not knowing where things are going, literally putting your ass on the line in a contest.

Also, my girlfriend and I are planning a pretty involved costume/roleplay/bondage/sensation scene, but it's going to take a lot of stuff and really deserves an audience, so that hasn't happened yet."

Edgar_Allan_Rich,musictheory,1389296974.0,"IMO:

A song should have one melody.

See [the wiki article and definition of a melody](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody).

More than one melody will confuse the listener. Do not confuse melody with harmony. Do not confuse melody with theme. Do not confuse embellishment with melody. If you have more than one melody to fit a chord structure, why not write two separate songs?

If perhaps you mean ""How many *themes* should a song move through?"" then the answer is quite dependent on the end-goal. Traditionally, themes are accompanied by key and tempo changes; an effect which is very distinct and doesn't happen all that much in the pop song form. Furthermore, new themes tend to be developed, exploited, and then embellished (Disney movie ballads, Danny Elfman). I think most would agree that a pop song should have one over-arching theme that flows together across sections (50' pop, Bruno Mars, James Brown, Randy Newman), but that may depend on your definition of theme.  A progressive rock song on the other hand may actually have multiple themes like an opera or symphonic suite (Yes, Dream Theater, King Crimson, early Genesis) . Songs take many forms (AAA, ABAB, ABABCADCC, etc.) Often a song may contain an idea that is so idiomatic that it could barely warrant being called a theme or a melody (generic blues, Alice's Restaurant, or the verse from the Talking Heads' And The Days Go By). And yet another thing to consider is that even a band as crazy as The Mars Volta tends to stick to traditional song form: ABABCABCDC, a broad arch over 7 or 8 minutes with 4 or 5 separate themes throughout.

TL;DR: 1 melody, many themes if you are into that sort of thing and know how to develop them.

I'm aware that people do that, which is why I've always found those threads spectacularly unhelpful.

&gt;You may find it weird, but in my experience it is common for both genders to behave that way, and to judge the behavior of one gender differently from another seems like a double standard.

Uh. Yes. I'm not saying I judge my male friends any differently from my female ones. I think you're reading that because the topic happens to be one that's directed to women about men. Just because I say I judge men one way doesn't mean I judge women differently...we just don't happen to be talking about the way that I judge women at the moment. In both cases if I was talking to my friend and he or she said ""I don't want to date someone crazy,"" I would ask them if that was a particular concern for some reason. Because otherwise I don't know why they'd bring it up."

b00tler,actuallesbians,1389297731.0,"Well, I wouldn't say the 10th circuit is just a formality, for two reasons:

1) The 10th circuit's ruling (either way) becomes binding on all federal courts in all states within the circuit (Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah), unless &amp; until it is reversed by the Supreme Court, so a favorable ruling would bring marriage equality to all those states even before a Supreme Court decision.  (The only reason this isn't true with the 9th Circuit ruling on Prop 8 is that the S Ct ultimately held there was no standing.)  

2) if other circuits rule differently, a split of authority among the circuits makes it even harder for the Supreme Court to not take up the case the next time it is before them."

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389297862.0,"You know what? Some people are moody. Some dudes have inconsistent moods too. Crankiness is not always a result of PMS, and in many women is not a symptom of their period at all.

Furthermore, PMS does not *create* emotions in most people. At most, it amplifies them. Which means if she's really annoyed by something while PMSing, she's at least kind of annoyed by it when she's not. So please don't assume she's only annoyed because of a period.

It's a normal thing that most women go through on a regular basis, not a medical condition or something. Most women experience very minor PMS symptoms if they have them at all, and are quite capable of managing them appropriately.

I say this because we get a lot of questions around here that seem to treat PMS/being on one's period as if it's a major medical or psychological event. For some women it's pretty severe, but for most women it's just a minor annoyance."

The fields of math that I'm interested in researching are primarily published in online journals, rather than in print.

&gt;**Jets Receiver David Nelson Offers Autograph, Aid to Haitian Orphans**

The New York Jets may be out of the playoffs, but that doesn't stop many fans from showing pride for their 8-8 team.

Three days ago, a Reddit user with the optimistic name JetsWillWinSuperbowl sent out a request on the site under the title ""Anybody have a hookup to get a ball signed by Geno?"" 

He makes his plea: *""I'm not gonna give you some sob story or anything. I'm just a 21 year old kid who loves the Jets and Geno Smith. I know a lot of people on this forum have connections and of course I would be willing to pay. Thank you very much, this probably gets buried but even if one person who might be able to help sees it that would be awesome.""*

One user replied, telling JetsWillWinSuperbowl to wait and see if an autograph from Geno is ever worth anything. Ouch. 

But it became clear, the 21-year-old-without-a-sob-story was just looking for a piece of Jets memorabilia, replying: [""Not about what it's worth. Would just love to have it. Good or bad, he'll always be a part of Jets history.""](http://us.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/1uer0j/anybody_have_a_hookup_to_get_a_ball_signed_by_geno/cehpqqd)

A few users took notice, as did Jets wideout David Nelson.

Nelson, who's also known for his charity work especially after [he gave 15-year-old orphan Davion Only a tour of New York](http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2013/12/jets_receiver_david_nelson_honors_orphaned_boy_with_a_simple_touchdown_celebration.html) last month, responded to the request.

""Hey man, I saw this post and love your spirit. I'm no Geno Smith, but if you're interested in Jets autographs, I can offer you mine. Email me your name and address and I'll send something out to you. ... Thanks for being a great Jets fan, and I hope you're excited for next season like we all are!""

Nelson would return to his comment, adding *""My [IndieGoGo campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/house-the-vision) is ending soon and we haven't reached our goal yet. If you guys could help me spread the word, or even donate just a couple of bucks, I would appreciate it more than you'd know.""*

Turning his focus during the offseason to helping orphans in Haiti, Nelson is asking anyone interested in accompanying him and his brothers on a mission trip to inquire at info@imme.org.

Next time you speak to one of them, let them know that you need to maintain some space between yourself and them, because of their negative behavior and how it's impacting your life. They will be upset, but *you are an adult* and you can act like one with them. Just stay calm, keep it short and factual, and not emotional. Then just don't answer when they call or text. Imagine that they are not your relatives, but some people you used to know, who treated you badly and you therefore had to cut out of your life. Let them know that when they are ready to treat you like an adult, then and only then will you include them in your life again. Be prepared that this may not happen for years. And consider looking into counseling at your school. If you rely on your parents for financial support, you may have to also start looking into other ways to finance your schooling.

This is going to get better, it really is! The best part is that you are learning how NOT to be a parent, and if you ever decide to be one yourself, you're going to do *so* much better than your folks did with you. Hang in there in the meantime, because it really will get better."

Burning Target-retrograde to zero equalizes the velocity variable.

Assuming you are not in identical places in space, the direction variable will be off by an amount relative to your separation.

This difference is negligible (for KSP docking purposes) when you are within a few hundred meters, but it in itself does not mean your orbits  ""become identical""...

keypuncher,politics,1389299126.0,"&gt; For hundreds of years, since United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the 2nd Amendment was interpreted by the SCOTUS to refer exclusively to ""well regulated militias.""

Several problems with this statement.

1. At the time the Constitution and 2nd Amendment were written, ""well regulated"" meant ""well trained"".

2. The militia, at the time the 2nd Amendment was written, included all able-bodied males between the ages of 17 and 45.  That continues to be the case, except such women as enlist in the National Guard are also included.

3. The language of the 2nd Amendment does not support requiring membership in a militia as a requirement to keep and bear arms.

4. Prior to the 1876 decision, the 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms was considered by the courts an absolute right - exactly as the founders intended.  Subsequent court decisions that allowed gun control were made to keep guns out of the hands of blacks to prevent them from defending themselves, not on any reasonable Constitutional grounds."

I spent 5 years in the sports journalism field. I got my AA in Journalism, transferred to a state university, worked for the university sports department, interned at ESPN and CNN Sports, worked at ABC sports for 2 years and **I quit because of this right here.**

Taking a story and slanting it to make it in to something it totally wasn't. The guy wrote 2 paragraphs about the actual exchange of comments on reddit (leaving out the important ones), then added 3 quips about Geno Smith being a bad QB. **AT NO POINT IN THE REAL STORY DID ANYONE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT GENO BEING A BAD QB**

It might not even be the writer's fault. When I worked sports journalism, it was often the editors who would come in and add their own sensationalized headlines and tell me to ""fluff up"" the bad stuff. Controversy breeds curiosity and that brings in users to their site. 

But I sincerely hope the writer fixes this story in to what it should be: praise for Good Guy Nelson and /u/JetsWillWinSuperbowl- NOT bashing Geno and making Nelson seem like he's a part of some culture of Geno-bashing.

However, when it got down to the *details*.... Well, she was *supposed* to be giving me some goals/direction, but wound up with a bunch of vague ""suggestions"".... If I followed them as exactly as possible, and it didn't work as she wanted, it was my fault it hadn't worked... If I instead went with what *I* thought was along the same lines but more sensible and it *did* work, well, it was wrong and we shouldn't do it... 

Basically got the sense that most ENFJ's want to *feel* right and valuable even if they're *not*, which can lead to problems for those who are super insecure (like my boss).... And I don't have time for that shit. 

Ultimately, as I understand it, every type has some negative characteristics/weak aspects, but it turns out that when you get an ENTJ that is sick of the bullshit and an ENFJ that feels out of the loop and undervalued into a working relationship, the balance is very very delicate and doesn't take much to derail entirely... 

It's been enough for me to just ultimately decide that ENFJ's are so uniquely ill-suited to *my* personality type that it's best to avoid them so we don't bring out the worst in each other... 

I now mostly stick to XXTX types, and it seems like everyone is happier for it. I can get along with most other F types okayish, but not such great choices for close friendships."

The R word is such a condemning concept, you can't possibly use it to describe behaviors that are ""sometimes ok, depending on context.""

That is why time and again, when this question is addressed in the subreddit, people find it disturbing to have the R word used to describe dating preferences. Not that everyone is conscious of the sexual assault example, but that everyone has some sense that this is an intensely private, feeling based process that doesn't conform to public/society-wide social norms.

It always trivializes the word to use it this way. As my asian friend from rural florida reminds me, the real and painful and violent aspects of racism persist, in public and in the context of social norms. He's virulently anti-racist and left florida for good because of this, but still admits ""dating a white girl is the holy grail"" for him. Literally uttered those words."

About fifteen minutes after it hit my tongue, I was like *oh shit, I'm going to fuck up my glasses!* So I went into the bathroom and proceeded to spend half an hour putting my contacts in, playing with the globby little things and examining my face in the mirror. At times it was the ugliest I've ever seen myself, and seconds later I was marveling at my features and wondering how I never noticed how breathtakingly beautiful I was. 

Then I stabbed myself in the eye a few times, put my contacts halfway in and had them fall out, and somehow managed to get them settled in place. I don't remember if I washed my hands first. Dear god I hope I washed my hands.

*I almost forgot about this one - thanks for making this thread and dredging up pleasant memories :) 

Another time, the first time I took shrooms, I wound up in Wal Mart. For some reason I felt like I had peed my pants, so I crab walked to the bathroom and started staring in the mirrors doing contortions to see. I hadn't of course. Then a Wal Mart employee asked if I was okay; I guess I didn't look okay. I rambled, saying I was okay, I was fine... then realizing she could tell I wasn't fine, so spouted something like this

*yeah I'm fine, really, I mean I'm not fine but I am fine, like... my boyfriend just broke up with me, so I'm not fine, but it's a normal not fine, not a bad not fine, like you don't have to do anything about it, I'm ok... oh those guys outside waiting on me? no no no, I know them, they're my friiieeennddsss, you don't have to worry, I'm not hiding from them, they're waiting on me, they're saaafffeee, really I'm fine...*

We all profit from someone else going off and doing something like that. But I feel people get caught up in it too. At the end of the day, you are born alone and die alone. You have relationships with people of course but you are alone in your head.

STOP. This is extremely disrespectful and hurtful. It doesn't matter if it's a phase or not, or what ""it"" is. If your kid has told you te refer to them in a particular way, respect that. By wilfully ignoring your child, you are hurting the kid, and sending messages of intolerance, nonacceptence. And not-love. You could be causing your kid a lot of psychological distress. 

As for trans being a phase, could be, or it could not be. You're still better off supporting your kid. If it is a phase, she'll know her parent loved and supported her, no matter what. If it isn't a phase, he'll know his parent loved and supported him, no matter what. 

Also, a lot more younger people are discovering they're trans because they actually have access to the terms and what they mean. Before, all anyone may have heard about tramsgender people may be stories of cross dressing men, or the ""narrative"" popularized by the media of kids knowing they were ""trapped in the wromg body"". In reality, trans experience is a lot more diverse, and it's not always obvious. And it's hard to know you're something, when you don't even know the something exists.

It's entirely relevant here, because we are trying to determine what the 2nd Amendment means, and you pointed out that ""the militia meant everyone."" It meant everyone because they never foresaw having a standing army of the time that we currently have. 

&gt;And its completely applicable to today, if Afghanis can hold off the most powerful military in the world, the biggest population of armed citizen could too.

So then we don't need access to the same weapons the military has?

...except that when the money is being created out of thin air (as it is when banks lend), they don't have to worry about making money on existing money.  The money is created from nothing when they lend it, and has zero value before that.

&gt; If you really believed that you should be maxing out your personal leverage as you can pay back in the future with cheaper dollars.

That's the same argument used by people who say the US ought to be borrowing like crazy while the interest rate is 1/10 of 1%.

In a personal sense, the problem with that argument is that if my income should go away - as it might if there is another economic bubble that bursts - I would be ruined and lose everything.

From a national perspective, the problem with the idea is that we don't ever pay back the money loaned.  We roll it over - and the problem with that is that when the interest rate goes back up, it will be rolled over at the higher interest rate and the US won't be able to make the interest payments."

livecontent,AskReddit,1389300883.0,"I'm pretty sure I've seen UFO's twice. Once I was in my apartment and I happened to look outside and saw something. No idea what it was. It flew about 100 meters over top of my apartment but was completely silent. It had three lights, two blue ones and a white one. I called my boyfriend over and we watched it fly away and we were totally transfixed. After it was gone neither of us could figure out why we didn't grab a camera. It was like our minds were blank. Disclaimer: we were also high so that might have been it...

The second time I had just pulled into a campsite after driving all day and was setting up my tent for the night. I looked up and over top of some cliffs that were near the highway I pulled off there were two lights moving in odd directions, looping and moving not like airplanes should. Then they dipped behind my sight line and didn't come back.

Keep in mind though, in the first story I had just smoked a bowl so that could have been a contributing factor and in the second story I had just finished driving for 13 hours. So you might have to take these with a grain of salt. "

In other words, if they're not the kind of person to study something just because they're curious, then you sort of have to wait for some *other* issue to become a wedge for them, then maybe you can go back and tackle evolution once they've opened up to doubts.

ProfessorZoom,explainlikeimfive,1389301043.0,"The GW Bridge is a Port Authority bridge. All bridges and tunnels going into NYC from NJ are toll lanes. They're either staffed lanes or E-ZPass lanes. So if you shut down a few lanes, and now the massive, massive, massive amount of people going into the city in the morning, who normally just for example have seven lanes to work with, now have to merge to three lanes, you're going to have to major traffic congestion. 

Now, from what I've read, the lower level employees were strongarmed by Christie's guy in the agency to just close the lanes and I think they were told to not tell anyone. Times are rough and jobs are scarce. I don't know about the PANY/NJ, but toll workers, road crew, admin staff for the NJ Turnpike and Garden State Parkway are paid pretty well. So no one is trying to fuck up their job. Now there is supposed to be notification so that the city can properly set up detour routes to help alleviate any congestion. But it was done at the very last minute which is why they were all caught off guard. 

And even with a basic level of determination, the Port Authority is a bureaucratic mess and no one knew what the hell was going on."

aDDnTN,nashville,1389301084.0,"have you actually ridden either of those systems you mention or are you just regurgitating something you read before?

Nashville MTA is a hell of a lot more convenient that NOTHING. it's better than something like what knoxville, nashville or even atlanta offer (ATL's got more covered stops and buses, but the service is pretty unreliable). nashvills mta only suffers from a lack of affluent interest, which is odd because a lot of affluent parents seem to have NO QUALMS with sticking their 6th grade and up child with MTA for 2-4 trips a day.

also, chicago's infrastructure was built with mass transit in mind originally. they have a strong multi-modal system with many different systems all working together. And have for some time because that city became huge before the interstate system was created or even before cars became popular. But anyone one of chicago's many mass transit systems by itself isn't as good as all of them together.

we don't have any of that in nashville and we had city planners that thought it was a lovely idea to run 3 interstates directly through downtown! in hindsight, we know that to be wrong. furthermore, we did have trollies up and down all the major thoroughfares, but paved over them when GM bought out all the trolly companies in the 30's and 40's. so this whole ""in general the public transportation in Nashville as a whole, is pretty shoddy"" concept is only a new thing (historically), and comes from a local gov't that has been completely uninterested in providing anything but scraps for it's underclass for decades. Doesn't hurt that that local gov't has long been making back room deals with whichever rich-capitalist-in-a-suit is willing to line their pockets today.

Banner_Free,Frugal,1389301462.0,"I'm kind of a cell phone enthusiast (I really need better taste in hobbies...) so this is a topic that's near and dear to my heart. To my understanding, here's how switching over to T-Mobile would work for you right now.

**Early Termination Fees:** T-Mobile will reimburse you for your Verizon ETF, so you don't need to worry about that (unless you don't have cash on hand to pay the ETF). You will have to trade in your Verizon phones to T-Mobile for this.

**Service Cost:** Three lines of unlimited talk/text/data, with one line getting 500MB data and the other lines getting 2.5GB data, will cost $110/mo. (Source: [T-Mo Plans](http://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/family.html) )

* *Note that all lines have technically unlimited data, but they throttle your speeds down aggressively once you hit the ""limit"" on the plan.*

**Phone Cost:** An iPhone 5S will cost $25/mo with $0 down. Three of them would cost $75/mo. (Source: [T-Mo Phones](http://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phones.html) )

* *Note that they have many cheaper options, e.g. iPhone 4 for $16/mo with $0 down.*
* *Note that you can also buy a phone up front instead of making monthly payments.*
* *Note that you can also buy a compatible phone from a third-party and bring it with you.*

**Total Cost:** $185/mo assuming all three of you get iPhone 5S. You get unlimited talk and text, plus 2.5GB data for you and your sister and 500MB data for your mother.

In short, for zero up-front cost, you can reduce your monthly bill **and** get brand-new phones. If T-Mobile service is good in your area, it's a pretty sweet deal.

Edited to add: *(Thanks, /u/Red0817 !)*

**Trade-in Value:** T-Mobile will give you account credit for your old phones. For example, an 8GB black Verizon iPhone 4 is worth a $50 credit. (Source: [T-Mo Trade-in](http://www.t-mobile.com/DeviceRecovery/cell-phone-trade-in.aspx) )"

Hell look at the very villain you're comparing him to: When people want a terrifying villain that can cross lines and outthink their hero, they borrow the Joker.  The most notable comic arc of Batman's existance is arguably the Killing Joke.

Meanwhile the two most notable story lines of ironman are Extremis and Demon in a Bottle, neither of which features the mandarin in a meaningful way.  Most people have never even heard of the mandarin.  Even fewer know that he relies on his rings for magic power and that he is no longer a fu manchu racist charicature.  The mandarin just doesn't have the sort of villain power people seem to want out of him."
LizzieDane,AskWomen,1389301574.0,"&gt; Because there is such a thing as video game addiction

Yeah, there is. But ""trying to cut them out"" doesn't mean you have one. No, I didn't say the support groups were the defining factor. No, ""most people"" do not suffer from addiction. They might do things often that they think they should cut down on, but that's not *addiction.* ""I guess I could drink less,"" is not alcoholism.

I know people use the term colloquially to mean something they maybe indulge in a little too much, but that's not the way I'm using it. Actual honest to goodness addiction is something people are desperate to stop because it's impeding their ability to function. I can't be around people with addiction problems. People who treat every day without &lt;problematic behaviour&gt; as a roaring success are incredibly triggering for me.

How did P.J. Tucker go from making 22 threes in the entire 2012-13 season to becoming one of the top corner specialists in the league?

Constam,Planetside,1389302051.0,"&gt;Really worried about the lack of lock on changes

They are changing them. Maybe not as much as some people would like, but most of the changes they mention sounded good to me.

First there's the bug fixes:
&gt; fixed the issue with [stealth] not always granting the lock-on increase.

&gt;Changes to A2A missiles for PU002 were not intentional and being addressed.

Then there's this completely new mechanic:

&gt;We implemented the new lock-on mechanic that adjusts the lock-on speed based on the distance of the shooter to the target.

Not sure what effect this will have in game right away, that depends on the speed, but it sounds like something that can be adjustable to make them easier or harder to dodge/escape in the future. If it's implemented well, or tinkered with when it needs to be, this could be a very balancing mechanic when it comes to A2A.

And there's these changes for helping pilots be more aware of where lock-ons are coming from, which should help avoid them or at least avoid going back to that area and getting locked on again.

&gt;We added the lock-on indicator for third person view and we made missiles appear more accurate on remote clients.

&gt;Displaying missiles that are tracking you on the mini-map is still coming. There will be a small red dot on the map for each missile currently locked on to you. This gives pilots information on which direction the missile is coming from, how far away it is, etc.

&gt;We are also still working on displaying more detailed information about what is locking-on to you. Such as displaying what type of rocket it is or how many hostiles are attempting to lock-on to you. We are still finalizing what specific information we want to display here.

Those all sound like good changes to me.

As for the new missiles, they could be done well or not, that remains to be seen. Coyotes *say* they have low damage and short range but it had better be pretty damn low and pretty damn short or they're going to be the next most OP thing in the game. The guided missile doesn't sound that overpowered, if it requires you to keep your cross-hairs on the enemy the whole time then it's not much different than emptying your nosegun at them.

Overall, it's a step in the right direction. They aren't going overboard and just removing lock-ons altogether despite the passionately vocal minority that wants that. G2A lock-ons aren't nearly as big a problem as A2A anyway. By giving pilots new weapons to choose from and making A2A slower at range they might no longer be the best choice."

But when you transition you feel so much fucking better and it seems that before you were looking at life through a foggy window. Also the whole children thing, there is always saving sperm and ftm can go off hormones for awhile and get pregnant if they wish.

EByrne,AskMen,1389302372.0,"For the most part, guys don't really meddle in their friends' relationships. To put it bluntly, they don't really care, although that sounds a lot more callous than it is. Really, it just means that if their buddy is happy, then they recognize that that's really all that's important.

In my experience, pretty much the only way that a guy will speak out against a buddy's girlfriend is if he gets the sense that she's taking advantage of him, cheating on him, or manipulating him (trying to isolate him from friends and family, lying, persistently undermining his confidence, etc.). And when that happens, most guys will assign a lot of weight to their friends speaking out, precisely because they almost never do speak out. It's also probably worth noting that how good of friends they are matters a lot. I have lots of guys that I would consider friends, but only 5-6 that I'm close enough to that relationship warnings/advice could conceivably be 'in-bounds'.

In my dating life, I've only had one girlfriend that any of my friends expressed reservations about (and they were right to; we weren't good for each other). Conversely, I've only spoken negatively about a couple of my friends' girlfriends, out of dozens. 

That's why the brief description that you gave seems unusual, when stacked up against my own experience. In my experience, none of the guys that I know would seriously try to convince a buddy to dial back his relationship, presumably so that he'll be more available for hanging out. They'll tease him for spending all of his time with you, but no more than that.

Just based on my own experience, I'd say that either the friends have more serious reservations with you that your BF isn't letting on (less likely) or your BF wanted to back off and it was easier to scapegoat his friends than be honest (more likely).

Or, alternately, his friends just aren't very much like the guys that I've been friends with.

Another way of thinking about it is, as linked elsewhere in the thread, there are studies that suggest that trans people have brain structures closer to the gender then identify with than that they were assigned at birth. As such their brain has a different road map for how the body should be than it actually is, causing considerable distress. It isn't to the same degree for everyone, which is why there are non-op trans people, but for the most part by getting srs they correct the issue and no longer feel distress based on their body itself."

Goosemaniac,AskReddit,1389303370.0,"I worked as a telemarketer for a small mortgage company during the summer after I graduated from high school.

It was quite easily one of the most ridiculous places I'd ever been involved. The majority of people whom worked at the place, at least as other telemarketers were drug users; pretty much everyone smoked pot, but there were an incredibly large amount of cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy users. The month before I started, one of the employees whom had been fired, came to work on heroin, and was waving a gun around in the parking lot. Several occasions occurred in which the manager came in absolutely shit-faced; I'm not talking about a couple beers, he drank a full bottle of Jack Daniels. Quite a few of the loan officers, and even some of the management had been to jail; ironically, they were some of the nicer people at the company...

The owner had the largest lack of empathy I've ever seen of an individual. He purposefully promoted selling reverse mortgages to people whom would not have benefit, lied about his rates until it was time to sign the deals, and even fucked me over when tax time came; he paid me under the table, but when tax-time came I was stuck with ~1000$ bill which I was completely not expecting.

What you should do is back off and leave him alone. If it's important to you to talk, that's ok, but can you wait until he's done whatever thinking that he needs to do? You can assert your needs (to talk about Thing) but also have it be for when he's ready to do so, rather than Right Now. 

It may also depend on what he's upset about. Upset that the sink sprang a leak? Talking may just never really be a thing for that - that's more just a matter of fixing the sink and then calming down. Upset at you because of a thing you did? Then yeah, talking will probably need to happen, but it makes sense to me that he might not be able to do that right away.

kornberg,Austin,1389303658.0,"Check with Dr Harris or Dr Mouser at North Austin Animal Hospital (512-459-7676)--they can and will help you out. 

&gt; Isn't there ANYBODY in the Austin area that treats people like humans, where the life of the animal is more important than whether the vet gets paid today or next month??

Vet hospitals are small businesses with very high overhead. They don't get the funding and state money that a hospital for humans gets. Additionally, if you'd ever been to an ER with no insurance, you would know that all they will do is what they are legally required to do (stabilize you so that you're not actively dying) and discharge you unless you can pay up front. My husband broke his hip a few years ago and he had to pay almost $1000 out of pocket, up front before they would look at him. 

Vets have staff and bills to pay too. They have to maintain licenses, inspections and pay for utilities and also keep medication and supplies fully stocked. Things expire and have to be thrown away if they are not used and they can't just not keep things on hand. Their staff rarely makes a living wage and rarely get benefits. Unless Austin Energy and HEB started taking ""the clients will pay at the end of the month"" in exchange for goods and services, the business has no choice but to be pretty firm on payment up front so that their staff can survive and the business is kept running. Additionally, lots of people don't actually pay once the service is rendered so the clinic knows that they are taking a risk. Clinics actually budget in unpaid payments into their yearly expenses because it happens *all the time*. How do they know you, a new client, is going to actually pay them? 

It's not the clinic's fault that you don't have emergency funds you can use for pet care. You made a commitment to your pet when you brought them into your home and it's your responsibility to make sure that you can get that care. It's not the job of the vet clinic to cover your ass when you screw up."

CadHuevFacial,AskWomen,1389303854.0,"My boyfriend was in the infantry, we've been together for about 3 years now. He was really my introduction to military culture and certainly the first person in the military I formed any kind of bond with, as very few of my classmates enlisted after HS. I knew long before we dated that he joined the infantry, and we spent his last two years of enlistment as a couple, a few months of which included a deployment overseas. To be honest, I was never once bothered by the notion that he more likely than not killed someone while in combat because I understood that, as an infantryman in the U.S. Army, his #1 priority was to fulfill his mission's objective and do so while ensuring his entire unit made it out alive, at whatever cost. I understood from the beginning that life at war is not something that is even remotely familiar in the civilian world, including actual combat and the sometimes endless hours of downtime between missions. 


Still, what helped reinforce my acceptance and support of his particularly dangerous line of work was knowing that he absolutely did not join the infantry because he wanted to kill people and shoot cool guns. He joined due to an overwhelming sense of duty, because for him, serving in the infantry meant adding credibility to his opinions regarding how our country is run. I certainly would have had reservations if he had joined for the former reasons listed above, even if every other trait of his remained intact. Still, I think it's important for civilians, especially those looking to date members of the infantry, to understand that war is not rational, it isn't fair, and it is not simple. It's important to understand that the action of killing in combat does not necessitate a violent and sociopathic ethic, and that in war, killing for the sake of living and protecting your brothers in arms does not by default make you an emotionless monstrosity of a human. 

My SO is the most caring, loving, funny, and passionately moral person I have ever dated or befriended. As in any other profession, he left his professional responsibilities at work, and resumed his personal life off-hours as a decent, normal human being with the same needs and personal responsibilities as anyone else. I know he has confirmed kills from his last deployment, but he told me about them without me ever asking. I was never planning on asking in the first place because, shit, I thought it was common sense that you don't just point blank ask someone if they've killed another human being. You never know how much weight that experience bears down on their life. I know, and am perfectly ok with knowing that for my SO, his experience just....doesn't effect him. It was his job, his life and the lives of his unit were on the line, and that's just what you do! It was what he trained for thousands of hours to do, and like the old joke says, the only thing he felt when he pulled the trigger was ""recoil"". 


It's been over a year since the end of his enlistment, and as far as I know, there haven't been any signs or symptoms of bad temperament and unpredictability. He's as sweet, strong willed, funny, and considerate as ever.


Anyway, I realize I'm speaking anecdotally, but what I'm trying to get at is, if I were you I wouldn't be too concerned about people suddenly cutting a relationship short or running away upon finding out you killed someone, especially if they knew you were in the infantry. To be honest, I'd find it difficult to put much time into dating someone who has no concept in the first place about what a job in the infantry entails. Please remember also that you absolutely are not expected or required to tell anyone about those events unless you are comfortable enough to do so, and even then only when you personally find relevant. I'm sure you feel it isn't something to be flaunted (I think that would send an alarming message), but really, it's up to you to decide if it's important enough to bring up or discuss. 


War has been the driving force behind our species' advancement for literally thousands of years. People should  realize by now that just because it doesn't happen in our backyards doesn't mean our next-door neighbors aren't firing/dodging bullets on behalf of all of us elsewhere."

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1389303987.0,"Thanks a ton for this update! I feel like this means tarte employees are probably browsing reddit right now so just in case they didn't get the message clearly enough:  

The fact that **the price remained constant despite decreased product is what we're frustrated about**. 

I personally will not be buying from tarte unless they get their act together and I'm sure there are plenty of companies that can fill the void. Here are some suggestions from the [previous discussion](http://redd.it/1umys0) on tarte:  

* /u/seashells15 mentioned [Little Sparrow Cosmetics](https://www.etsy.com/shop/LittleSparrowCo?section_id=14404747&amp;ref=shopsection_leftnav_1) for their lip jellies which are lip- &amp; cheek- safe (also cruelty-free if that was a selling point with tarte for you, and indie!) and Wet 'N Wild (CF) 
* /u/Vudell replied with a swatch of the WNW one [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1umys0/rant_tarte_cheek_stains_and_lipsurgences_12_the/cejv45e)
* /u/murphyrants mentioned the Revlon Kissable Balm Stains which she has tried and liked, and has heard about CoverGirl, Neutrogena, Jordana (also CF), and Rimmel having similar products  
* /u/sashimiplatter commented about the Josie Maran cheek gelees (CF) [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1umys0/rant_tarte_cheek_stains_and_lipsurgences_12_the/cek1jjl)  
* And /u/LSpeezy commented on the Illamasqua (CF) cream blushes [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1umys0/rant_tarte_cheek_stains_and_lipsurgences_12_the/cejs51o) 

Edit: These are mainly suggestions for the cheek stains, but if anyone wants to find a better value dupe for some of their other products you might request an indie/CF dupe at [this thread](http://redd.it/1ut9gh) over at /r/indiemakeupandmore! "

superspeck,texas,1389304084.0,"Then you're a fool. 

If you were worried about bland cars driven by stupid people, you would have said that you're worried about Nissan SUVs or Venzas or Priuses. 

If you were worried about old farts, you'd have cracked a joke about an old man in a hat driving a Buick who can't see over the dashboard. 

If you were worried about cars that go zoom without notice and are probably driven by someone who is aggressive and stupid, you'd have said Civic, WRX, or Mazda 3. 

If you were worried about people who get into wrecks habitually, you'd have said Volvo. 

You've misidentified your targets greatly. Accords and Camrys may be boring, but they're also sensible, and generally are driven by people who have two brain cells to rub together. 

The things that scare me most driving in Texas are, in order:

1. Bubba. Especially on back roads. Especially on back roads that bubba has driven on his whole life with a can of Lone Star in his cup holder, because his brother in law is the county sheriff and they play poker on Thursday night with the judge and JP. Since no one else drives that back road ever, bubba feels free to cut corners across the centerline and never signals. 
2. College girls in Lexus RX or Nissan Rogue/Murano. Ten to one they ain't paying attention to anything. 
3. Old men in non-cowboy hats. 
4. One parent with a suburban full of kids. 
5. A big domestic sedan full of men. (Race or culture is immaterial.) 

By far, Bubba is the biggest risk to my daily life given where I live and what roads I drive. "

Right on, and if he's so easily influenced that he'll break up with you because his friends wanted to spend more time with him, then that's pretty crazy. Either: 

A) he agreed on some level, and wanted to spend more time with them instead of with you. Attributing it to his friends just made it easier to explain, or
B) He has crappy friends and is too spineless to make his own choices

My guess would be that it's A, but in either case, life's too short to spend it with people who fall into either category. And FWIW, I wouldn't worry about this kind of stuff moving forward. Most guys understand that their friends are entitled to relationships and deserve to be happy.  

I'd definitely recommend that, going forward, you try to think of it as just a case where your priorities didn't happen to align at this specific time in your lives. For whatever reason, he wants to spend most of his time with his friends, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. There's no shortage of guys out there who are looking to get more involved in a relationship, and I'm sure you'll find one if that's what you're after. "

CadHuevFacial,offmychest,1389304835.0,"I'm sorry, but white and male privilege are absolutely real and inescapably apparent to those who are disadvantaged by it. 

As a white man, you are more likely to be the first person considered for a job opening in the highest-earning positions in the country and be promoted based on your potential for success instead of the actual work you do. Your gender and race are both represented by &gt;80% of congress, and 43/44 presidents got to that position because they share your physical characteristics. You have the privilege of not having to worry about getting pregnant or (generally) raped, and probably don't know what it's like to go a single day without the very real and constant fear of being sexually assaulted then later being blamed for it. Your experience is represented in almost every movie and television series more likely than not as the lead, or in a position of power. As a white man, you are also part of a demographic that gets away with criminal activity more often than literally any other. 

If you don't think those (few) examples seem like such a big deal, then that is the ultimate sign that you are privileged in a way you don't even understand. White men are the least marginalized group of people in the U.S., and as a white man, you live in a society whose social, economic, and political conventions systematically benefit you while disadvantaging literally every other kind of person that lives here. You have the *privilege* of not having to deal with those things."

turbotong,AskReddit,1389304880.0,"Not an employer, but I was once an waiter at a restaurant.  The cooks were all Hispanic.  One day, some world soccer cup was on and Mexico was playing, so the cooks brought in and set up a tiny TV in the kitchen to watch the game while cooking.
One of the managers decided the cooks were not cooking fast enough and that the TV was plugged in across the hall, creating a tripping hazard.  He went into the kitchen and told them to turn off the TV, or else he would do it.
The Hispanic cooks stopped what they were doing.  They all (about 6 of them) turned their head toward the manager and stared at him.  Those who were busy cutting vegetables or meat picked up their knives.  Those who did not have a knife in hand picked up either a knife or other blunt cooking utensil within arm's reach.  They stared down the manager.  
The manager held up his hands and slowly backed out of the room, keeping his eyes on the employees as he left.  He then told the rest of the staff not to mess with the TV."

Tannekr,DaystromInstitute,1389304928.0,"I do agree that ship and weapon strength has been fairly inconsistent in *Star Trek*, but your examples don't persuade me otherwise on what should have happened at Veridian III.

* *Reliant* and *Enterprise* are too close in size and strength to disqualify them as examples.

* 1) Kruge was only successful because *Enterprise* was **extremely** undermanned. 2) The difference in size and strength here isn't as disparate as it is in *Star Trek: Generations*. If we also assume that Kirk and company would have fared much better with a full crew, it just shines an even poorer light on the Veridian III battle.

* Crews on both the *Defiant* and *Lakota* were clearly uncomfortable firing on each other and weren't likely pressing their attacks as much as if it had been a normal enemy engagement.

* The Regent and his crew were clearly out of their depth.

* If the Duras sisters would have made a suicide run, that'd be different. They didn't. A better comparison would be the battle between the Jem'Hadar and *Odyssey* before the kamikaze attack. Odyssey managed to survive attacks from three Jem'Hadar attack ships. Ships that were likely more powerful than the Duras BoP. Sure Odyssey was in really bad shape, but they were still operating. Not only that, Captain Keough ran through the entire shield spectrum, and without prior knowledge that he'd need to do so.

Despite all of this, it doesn't matter. The problem is Riker didn't even *try* to fire back or change shield harmonics. There's no downside to doing either that I can see. You mention that rotating shield frequencies isn't necessarily a one-button operation. If my memory serves right, virtually every time we see it done, it's a very simple procedure. So why didn't Riker at least try?

JOlsen77,goodyearwelt,1389305636.0,"I'm not aware of any ""bad"" C&amp;Js. There's benchgrade and handgrade, the latter of which is much more expensive. The following is from a [discussion thread](http://www.styleforum.net/t/3589/handgrade-vs-benchgrade/0_20) on SF:

""I've always thought of myself as a 'student' of this board rather than a 'teacher' but here goes based on my meagre experience: Both are machine-made shoes and are goodyear welted. The handgrades use finer calf leathers, asymmetric lasts, oak bark tanned soles and have a channeled sole. The handgrades, the brown and tan ones at least, are also antiqued (though not to the level of Edward Green). The benchgrade C&amp;Js are good shoes though not nearly as elegantly styled as the handgrades. I have a couple of pairs of the benchgrades and like them as I find them attractive and comfortable and feel they represent good value (much cheaper than Church's and with better quality leather). They definitely don't have the 'wow' factor of the handgrades on the 337 last.""

Edit: 6t5g just reminded me below; my C&amp;J shell definitely doesn't shine like my Alden shell."

But as a dad of a 5 year old boy who got suspended, just wanted to remind you to take the long view. The best advice I got from a child psychologist was this:  How much do YOU remember from when you were 4?  

Totally reasonable your kid has issues.  But kids from any background have issues. Prying out reasons from the past doesn't seem as helpful as moving forward with love and understanding.

The one trick I've had some luck with is switching the dynamic to the third person.  Instead of ""you need to do this or else this"", which is inherently a me vs. you dynamic, tell your son you are ""trying to be good dad"", and if you let him act out and get kicked out of school, would you be a good dad, or a bad dad?  Ask HIM what you should do, just as an experiment.  Might not work like magic, but it might flip the dynamic away from a pure battle of wills.

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1389305782.0,"I agree progressive tax rates are better. Mainly because they allow a gradual approach of the top marginal rate limit, no sticker shock to the taxpayer and allow for setting a top marginal rate effectively a maximum income. Personally I like pairing UBI with exemptions set equal to the annualized minimum wage beyond which the marginal rate increases at 5-10% every time non-ubi income doubles while eliminating other deductions and credits. 

So, if you don't work you get UBI. If you do work you get at least UBI  + up to minimum wage before you're taxed at all. After that a gradual progressive tax code that sets effective maximum incomes by on the marginal rate.

&gt; Flat taxes are NOT progressive or regressive by definition. I'm not sure you understand what progressive taxes are.

Mathematically speaking a flat tax with UBI or even large exemptions/deductions can mimic the effects of a progressive tax code in its effective rate. An income of $0 begins with effectively a negative tax rate that nets UBI. As taxable income rises the effective rate approaches 0% up to the point tax liability equals the UBI. Beyond that ones rate approaches a limit of whatever the flat tax rate is as income approaches infinity. The effect mimics a progressive code, but isn't structurally so and the rate at which flat approaches the limit is quite fast relative to the UBI.

Politically though I don't think there's a chance in hell of the US going from where we are to a 40% or 50% flat tax necessary for a significant UBI. Working people won't see the math that says they'll come out ahead. They'll just get sticker shock and call you nuts."

Albums above singles. Now you can't always have that, but I generally stray towards bands who create and experience rather than a couple of good tunes thrown together.

I used to listen extensively to the vocals (not lyrics), harmonies and the beat. I was never really a guitar man. Apart from solos the instrument held no instrument for me. After eventually getting stuck in a music rut. Listening to the same bands over and over. I decided to expand, didn't really know where to start. Asked my brother and he suggested Robert Johnson. So that's what I did, I tracked each most influential guitarist in order up to today, finishing with the likes of Rodrigo Y Gabriela and Jack White. Weird mix right.

Don't take any bait that she launches at you. Don't fight. If you guys get too heated/upset, take a break. This is your future--this isn't a who is right sort of argument. Being right is pretty lonely. Being married is about figuring it out as a team. 

So go off and you each write out a list of 5 priorities and how you plan on making that happen. So if she writes down having another kid and buying a house, she's going to have to figure out how to make that happen--financially, logistically and pros/cons. Also address reasonable contingencies--what would we do if the kid was sick or if a common natural disaster ate a new house. Obviously you are never totally prepared for things like that but it's always a good idea to talk about things like that.

From someone who values character over physical attributes, thank you for sticking to your guns and reinforcing my hope for a world where more people reach such a place of understanding and positive action. :) "

OswegoWriter,WritingPrompts,1389306445.0,"Prompt #2 - Upon Waking [490]

The man continued. ""The last I remember, I was drifting off on a flight to London. I was reading a book-- can't remember which one now. So finding myself plummeting toward the Atlantic is something of a shock, amiright?. The air is thin, making it hard to catch my breath. It's cold, too. Really cold. *It's Summer*, I think to myself, *it shouldn't be this cold!* Funny what goes through your mind at fifteen-thousand feet.

""I ain't entirely sure how I ended up there. Well, by 'there' I mean, 'falling through the air'. Obviously I flew there. On a jet, smart-ass; if I could fly, I wouldn't have been in that predicament. It was a normal business trip to Berlin, with a layover in Heathrow. I'd kissed the wife and kids goodbye, ate some crappy take-out at JFK; what could I have done that brought me... 'there'? I was one of a million businessmen on a plane, just doing their job. Happens every day.

""*Patriot Games*! That's the book I was reading! Someone had left it in the airport, and I didn't have anything to read on the flight, so--. Look, that ain't important. I managed to focus, take inventory of my situation: no one else is falling with me, I'm alone. There ain't no flaming wreckage, no screams of terror. I ain't even wearing a parachute. The ocean is getting closer, fast. What few options I had are kaput.

""*A dream!* I start thinking, *I must be having one of those falling dreams!* I begin to wonder if it's true that you die if you don't wake up before you hit the ground. I tell myself, *I just have to wake up before I hit the water.* But you got to remember, those planes fly high, so even though this ocean is just rushing towards me, I'm falling for a long time. And I'm just telling myself, *wake up!* I don't even realize it, but I'm screaming it at the top of my lungs: 'WAKE UP! WAKE UP!'

""And that's when she catches up to me. The flight attendant. I got to tell you, she had the loveliest set of tits I'd seen in forever. And she just comes up next to me, and we're falling together, and she says to me, 'sir, you're having a bad dream.'

""It turns out it was a dream. All of it. The flight, the take-out, *Patriot Games*, everything. I wake up, and my wife's standing over me, looking all worried. I'm in my own bed, tangled up in the bed sheets, and she says I was screaming in my sleep. I ain't never done that before; it's got to be some kind of sign. So I called my boss the next morning, said I can't go to Berlin.

""And you know what?"" the man asked as he sipped his beer. ""Not a damned thing happened on that flight. Not. A. Damned. Thing."""
B68B,tall,1389306460.0,"I consider myself to have pretty good posture. For the first while I had to make a conscious effort to pull my shoulders back and stand up straight but now it just happens (happens even easier if you have strong shoulders and back). Don't worry about looking smug. Looking confident is 10 times better than looking like some hunched over sap. With regards to the neck, I think my neck sticks out as well but I will be looking down at things for the rest of my life so I don't think there's an easy fix there. Pulling your shoulders back should create a zone where your neck feels comfortable and probably doesn't look too weird.

Tannekr,DaystromInstitute,1389306601.0,"&gt; Catastophic would have been the loss of all hands on Enterprise and the loss of the Veridan system. Riker saved all of that with the saucer sep &amp; destroying the bird-of-prey. No shame in winning a hard-fought battle.

I guess what I meant was that while the results weren't as bad as they could have been, it still shouldn't have gotten to the point it did. It shouldn't have been a hard-fought battle. Even with the *Enterprise* shields down, the Duras sisters were way outclassed in just firepower. Riker doesn't use this to his advantage for some reason.

&gt; I'm sure there was a board on inquiry into the loss of Enterprise. If I was a board member, my main question would have been - Why the hell wasn't CAPT Picard on the bridge and Riker on Veridan III??? Blame (if any) rests on Picard, not Riker.

If we really want to put the blame on Veridian III on someone, it's the writers. But, I know how everyone hates the it's-a-TV-show-argument. But, if we forget about that. Yes, Picard shouldn't have beamed down. However, the fact is that he did and Riker was responsible for the safety of the ship. Something he *should* have been capable of as XO.

&gt; It wasn't Standard Operating Procedures to rotate shield harmonics with the Romulans, Cardassians, or Ferengi in battle. Why would it be for Klingons? There must be a reason why this wasn't just commonly done.

The argument that rotating shield harmonics depends on the culture your dealing with doesn't make sense to me. Unless you're giving vague examples of when those cultures penetrated shields and shield frequencies weren't rotated (which I would love to be reminded of, because I can't think of them off the top of my head), it has nothing to do with that. It has to do with the fact that the enemy is penetrating your shields. The episode *The Jem'Hadar* came out four months before *Star Trek: Generations*, and we clearly see Captain Keough running through shield frequencies, with apparently little trouble, I might add.

&gt; Anyway, it is easy to arm-chair QB this in post, but in the heat of battle, I don't think they had any reason to suspect this tactic would be more effective.

The enemy is shooting through your shields. You should have EVERY reason to suspect rotating shield harmonics might help.

&gt; Either way, this should have been Worf's recommendation from minute one.

I agree, but this doesn't change the fact Riker didn't think of it either.

&gt; In addition to firing the 4 rear-facing phaser arrays.

I only remember one phaser blast.

&gt; Riker ordered Troi to get them out of Orbit.

That's fine, but why aren't we firing everything we have simultaneously?

&gt; We can only operate on what data Riker had at the time. He made the best calls he did, and won the battle with his ingenuity.

You're still not getting it. Riker doesn't need to know they had access to Geordi's VISOR. The data Riker had was that a Klingon vessel was shooting through your shields. Rotating shield harmonics should have been the **very first** thing ordered. It's some pretty lazy writing on part of the writers and poor commanding on behalf of Riker."

My advice is not to lose hope. Stay focused on high school for now, as you've still got a few months left. Contact admissions if you'd like.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389307275.0,"dbbbbb just told you in a nicer way what I'm saying - you need to have a little more empathy for your partner.

In terms of concrete advice, which I gave, was to take sex off the table if what you say you're craving is just intimacy.  Ask him to have nightly make out sessions with you, or naked cuddling, without expecting sex to result.  That will take a lot of pressure off him and make him feel loved, too.  

You haven't said anything that makes it sound like your guy has an LL, just that he's got a health issue and is often exhausted.  It's really important to be tuned into that.  I say this from experience.  I have been with my husband, who has Rheumatoid Arthritis, for 9 years.  He has up days and down days with regards to his disability.  Sure, it's hard on both of us, but it's harder on him.  It's my job, as someone who chooses to be with him, crippling joint pain and all, to sometimes put my needs aside as long as I know, overall, he'll move the sun and the moon to make sure he's meeting my needs as best he can.

It seems as though he could use some comfort.  If he doesn't like to discuss these things, consider sitting him down and at least expressing your *acceptance* of his fantasies (at least in the sense that you won't judge him for them).

You can't realistically go from an 18 to a 14 at the same time. an 18g is 1.0 mm, and a 14g is 1.6mm, at larger sizes you can do 1mm stretches at once but at such a small size you'd likely end up damaging your ears. 

You could also let your 18g holes close up and be immediately pierced at a 14g or bigger, but at this point it would be faster for you to stretch your current piercings at about 6-8 weeks per size. 

If you're thinking you could potentially go bigger than a 14g look at your 18g holes and make sure they're centered in your ear lobe, or have a piercer look at them and tell you if they're placed properly for stretching.

He is Pagan so he has trouble championing Alfred the Great's cause, and his heirs(Edward and the Aethelings).  Granted it is fictional, but you will definitely feel like you are IN Saxon England and his battle scenes are especially brutal and gory.  His descriptions of the ferocity of the shield wall, the desire for glory and reputation, the yearning for a good death with sword in hand....they are second to none.

Like, I might give them my ""I am only smiling because it's polite to smile"" look and redirect them onto another subject. Or I just react as if they'd commented on the air conditioning or something. Basically, I take it as neither a compliment nor an insult, but just act like it's a remark that I don't have a particular response to.

For most people, just the fact that I'm not responding positively is enough; I don't actually have to respond negatively. They get the hint once it's apparent that I'm not picking up what they're doing. If someone persists past that, then I don't think anyone would blame me for getting a little more direct about it. It is important to be pleasant when in a receptionist position, IMO, but there are ways to be direct without being unpleasant.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,malehairadvice,1389307966.0,"Nope. The style itself looks well done, but it consumes your look. I have no idea what you're going for but that style might not be for you. We have the same hair type. Here's what I see:

You look too old and too young for that cut at the same time. It's a cut for wealthy young children or old-fashioned dudes who are just trying to ""get by"". It looks like you're in costume for a movie set in a 60's business office, and without a more definitive clothing statement, it doesn't come across as hip. There's little life to it and frankly that mustache doesn't make you look cool or manly; it makes you look like a child molester. I suffer from the same mustache condition as well, unfortunately.

You look like a pretty young dude. I'd go for something with more life and energy and maybe even a little ""edge"". If that's not your thing, try some products that give you some body and shine.

You can't be an attentive dad, try as you might, with that schedule, which is one he's unlikely to stop doing any time soon, so him not wanting kids is a similarly responsible thing to do, even if it is coated with some selfishness (which is all the more reason if you know that about yourself, to not have kids).

TheWorldIsAhead,movies,1389308226.0,"Directing is very much a technical job most of the time. My interest in film is also very technical. So since everyone in this thread is choosing directors based on their vision and great films moreso than skill at directing (i.e. techincal understaing of directing acting, editing, vfx, music, cinematography, action etc.) here are my three: 

- J.J. Abrams. Abrams is underrated as a director actually in my eyes. His movies might be a bit too trivial, “mainstream” and forgettable, but the directing is always top notch. Super 8 has hands down the best child acting I have ever seen. There just isn't a false second in those actors performances. Like watching real kids interact. And the script was written by Abrams himself. His understanding of lighting, editing, 3D-space, scale, VFX and pacing is also stellar and look no further than the opening scene to Star Trek 2009 which is in my opinion one of the most gripping opening scenes to any film I've seen. Perfectly constructed in every way (Abrams said on the commentary they spent about 50% of editing just editing that scene, and 50% on the entire rest of the film), and every time I show someone Star Trek I say “Just the first ten minutes and then you choose if we go on.” They always say: “Well now I HAVE to see the rest dammit!”. The only other director I know who makes getting the technical side of directing flawless look so effortless is Edgar Wright. 

- Peter Jackson. Extremely technical. An innate love of VFX. I can't find the quote at the moment, but he has said he got into film first because of his love of visual effects. He is also a very calm man. So calm that in super stressful, super demanding shoots like LotR and The Hobbit he is confident he will come off so well on camera doing his job that he gives us unparalleled insight into filmmaking on hours of documentaries on the Extended Editions of the films. Filming very open and honest accounts of troubles and triumphs they had. If he wasn't such a cool guy films the size of LotR could never had been made. Other directors would not keep it together. 

- Joseph Kosinski. Again very technical. Works with superb cinematographer Claudio Miranda and together they work to figure out new ways to make EVERYTHING in the film and in the frame symmetrical. His Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder way of framing shots and choreographing action in Tron: Legacy and Oblivion appeal to me. I hate gritty and random. Give me symmetrical and polished every time. Also a love of electronic music. When I watch a Kosinski film I always find myself thinking if I was a big shot director this is almost exactly what my films would look like. Polished, symmetrical, heavily featuring steel, acrylic glass and robots, and with electronic music. So naturally I love his films. It feels like he really loves the same stuff I do. "

dirtyewok,coys,1389308400.0,"Not sure if Siggy is more talented than Holtby to be honest.

Siggy has more technical skill in terms of his shot but isn't particularly skilled in much else.

He is a CAM who should sit behind the striker and be asked to shoot. We continue to put him on the outside where he has no skills that are suited to play on the wing effectively wasting the skills that he does have.  He is not overly creative, lacks pace, is an average passer and not a great defender.  He is very controlled and has good discipline.

Holtby may not have as good a shot as Siggy but is probably equal or better on the other skills. Though is less controlled and disciplined than Siggy.

Between the two of them Holtby probably makes more sense to keep around as Siggy doesn't bring enough to the game as a winger and we don't/haven't utilized the type of CAM/support striker role that he would be very useful in.  Holtby on the other hand can help for depth in a CM, CAM or B2B role.

Truth is, with the players we have both Holtby and Siggy are seemingly down the pecking order in the middle of the pitch, which is where they would both be suited to play which makes both (unfortunately as i really do like both players) potential loan/sale bait."

There was a post about not running after dogs you're trying to catch because they think you're playing a game and keep running away.

On the other hand, a dog is obviously able to outrun a human on speed, but a reasonably fit, athletic human would be able to outmarathon the dog, so you could always run after it at a steady jog and carry it back to your house after it collapses from exhaustion.

Probably not good for the dog though."

I'm pretty sure all those bullet points are in fact the same group of people.  The majority of human beings continue to fantasize about and be attracted to people regardless of being in a monogamous relationship.

As for the 'full' feeling, I found that whenever I was overwhelmed with it I would just let myself eat a small amount of a food I considered 'safe' and force myself to realize that I felt much more stable afterwards. The paranoia of fullness often arose in me when I hadn't eaten in a while, and I was feeling pretty anxious and fragile. I would eat a bit in those situations and establish the link between healthy eating and an improved sense of wellbeing, and once I was in that rational state of mind I was more able to eat normally.

A lot of folks will enjoy talking to this guy and find him intriguing. Turns out just as many people don't want to talk to him at all, because he's completely boring. To those people. It's sort of like a mathematical equation. You balance the equation by finding the sort of folks that you enjoy and who also enjoy you. Maybe you don't tell witty jokes to each other, or come up with deep thoughts. Maybe you just talk about movies or sports or whatever. That's OK, as long as you are comfortable being yourself around these folks, and likewise for them to be comfortable around you. That's been my experience, anyway! Don't feel like you have to be a certain way--instead just be what makes you comfortable and then find others who share your feelings on the matter. You don't have to keep hanging out with friends (or even family) out of a sense of duty. Better to spend your time with people who get you.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,Austin,1389309031.0,"Having been to Chicago a few times, you should expect our ""mass transit system"" to suck donkey balls compared to what you're used to. Our train takes you nowhere you will want to go, the bus system will be ridiculously confusing and slow, and most areas will not connect seamlessly to one another as one would expect for a city of our size. Cabs on weekend nights are unbelievably unreliable when you call them (by phone or by app) so only expect to get one if you are literally downtown and surrounded by cabs. It's better than nothing, but man I wish our system was actually reliable and clear-cut like they are elsewhere.

All this and more are why I agree with audiomuse1 that bikes are a great option. Parking isn't so horrendous here yet so you can still drive a car pretty much anywhere you'd want to go and still find a spot. A rental car or Car2Go may work too.

Areas worth exploring on foot would be 6th &amp; Comal (hipster 6th), 6th &amp; Red River (dirty 6th), 6th &amp; Congress, Congress &amp; Monroe (SoCo), 5th &amp; Nueces (the warehouse district), Zilker Park (Barton Springs), North Loop &amp; Ave F (and the neighborhood to the south). You'll find lots of cool Austiny stuff if you just kind of wander from any of those spots. East side of the highway tends to be the more ""dangerous"" part of town. Anywhere else you can pretty much walk around without a care in the world on acid holding a wad of cash and you'd be fine.

vorpalblab,explainlikeimfive,1389309110.0,"Here are a few guesses.
We are not direct descendants of apes, they are a different species, though similar.

We separated long before.
Our body shape and surface characters developed shaped by other environmental forces.

We seem to share some development with Cro-magnon and similar hominids, and find they, like us roamed and hunted larger, high risk high reward game.

Our hunting success was helped by acquiring voices for long distance communication through language, better tool making, which was in turn supported by developing higher intelligence, bigger brains.

Over a couple million years of development our better nutrition grew a bigger animal. With wider hips on the female due to the bigger heads.

It is due to natural selection in that men seem to naturally select women to breed with that are more beautiful according to the needs for survival.

All animals select breeding stock according to how well the prospective mate represents the ideal for the breed.

Beauty across most human cultures away from the equator favour lighter skin, lower body hair, hip waist ratio suitable to head size, smaller stature. 

Bigger men compete better amongst themselves for mates, and have some advantage as hunters. Look at different male body types to see where they fit in the range of hunting on wide savannahs or in tight forests, living on small rations versus fighting big prey like mastodons.

Advantages to a smaller woman is less nourishment to provide, longer endurance of hard times.

Selection for less hair is due to less parasites hiding near the skin and also because the move north favors clothing whilst the previous range favored loss of hair so the skin can sweat. 

Human ability to sweat for cooling enables us to outperform our prey over long distance hunting, and travel over large hunting territories. We also out perform other hunters with the same advantage, the furred animals lose heat through panting, and other minimalist ways, so heat build up from long term exercise is mitigated by the ability to do short burst ambushes.

And don't forget we are pretty big land predators on the planetary scale, only bears, lions, tigers are bigger off the top of my head.

That heat advantage was adjusted by wearing clothing rather than shedding and re-growing fur every second day. As clothing improved, our hunting range widened north to the glaciers and even out to sea in boats.

Our women have kept pace in size, and with wider hips, but are still smaller and easier to feed. We breed out ugliness. According to our eyes.

So - girls?  Ignore what the other women say about your beauty. Its what the men say that counts. Comments from other women are designed to shame you into looking less beautiful.

And as far as bod hair goes? Most guys like it the way it comes. We been selecting for it for thousands of years."

When FFXI launched, the JP players got a core experience - wasn't Rise of the Zilart the first expansion? That's what shipped to North America for the release. Keep in mind the NA release was almost one year after the JP release. 

We had access to Sky then, and after 75 you could start socking away xp to modify how your character played (using a sort of bonus level/prestige modifier system, if memory serves). Dynamis existed, I think -- for a couple hours, twice a week, if you could afford the Hourglass (and had 50 or so friends handy). 

Chains of Promathia came later -- again, almost a year out -- and was the first NA expansion, bringing Sea and the Emptiness. PVP started to show up around that time? Fishing underwent and overhaul to make it less bottable/more engaging..

Then ToAU added a ton of shit, but I stopped playing then. 


Anyway, from JP release (Nov 2002) to NA release (Oct 2003) was almost a year; from NA release to first NA expansion (Sept 2004) was almost a year more. 

The ""king"" of horizontal content didn't get there overnight. It takes time to add all that shit in.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389309371.0,"My parents split when I was 15, and I was glad, but my dad, who intiated the divorce, felt guilty and decided to explain everything that was wrong about their relationship to me: from the fact that he never loved my mom (and never told her did) to that they only got married because she got knocked up with me when they were stoned after a few months of dating to the fact that they had a bad sex life.

Needless to say, this was pretty awful for a 15 year old to hear.  I mean, for starters, I knew I was the reason my parents were together in the first place, which was miserable for all of us.  That guilt is crazy.  Secondly, it's just that your kids don't need to know about your sex life.  Not as teenagers.  Maybe not ever.

Wait to spill the details.  Maybe, when they're in their early 20s, IF you have the kind of rapport that would make this kind of conversation seem natural as opposed to weird and out of the blue, you could mention the reason, in as vague as terms as possible.  But seriously, kids of any age do not want to know much of anything about what goes on (or doesn't!) between their parents sexually.

Edit: I'm not saying btw, that you should make sure your kids know that sex is important in relationships.  I'm pretty hippy dippy sex positive in that regard.  Tell them that a sex life that makes them happy is something they should require out of relationships, absolutely!  My stance is just that connecting that inherently to your own situation is a little TMI.  "

PlushieChomby,relationships,1389309618.0,"You've explained what *you* view as the ""practical uselessness"" of showing her the logs. Having been in a similar situation in the past, I went through and read every comment before chiming in myself, to make sure the little I have to contribute hasn't already been posted in a clear cut manner, so here goes: 

Your wife was wrong. You know it, she knows it, you're dealing with that part like adults, so I'm skipping over all that and going straight to why you should let her see the logs. 

Three years into a relationship that I thought was going swimmingly, my boyfriend used my desktop to check some stuff online, of which I thought nothing. Next morning, I found he'd minimized rather than closed out a tab where he was having a chat, and when I went to close the window, I also saw my name, got curious, and did the bad snooping thing, where I found he wasn't remotely cheating - much like your wife, he was just bitching about our relationship. To a girl in his class that I knew for reasons I won't go into here liked him. Without consulting strangers on the internet, I confronted him about it when he got home. We talked, we cried, we worked shit out and without my prompting, he promised to cut off contact with her, which he did. I'd had his passwords for as long as we'd been together, and he'd often encouraged me to check his email, phone, whatever if I felt suspicious, but the truth is, I'd just never bothered checking anything because it didn't fit my personal moral code. 

To my surprise, he said he wanted to read the texts and emails and chatlogs between two of my exes and me. I hadn't saved the chatlogs, or most of the texts, but my relationship with him was so important to me that I wanted him to know he could feel safe. I had nothing to hide, so I readily turned over *my* passwords, and gave him carte blanche to look through whatever he could find. *Because I had nothing to hide.* Like your wife, he went as far as asking me to save future chatlogs for him to read. I thought it was weird, but again, knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I hadn't been saying anything to anyone that would upset him, so it was easy to let go of my tiny bit of tugging pride on the matter and let him read what I was saying to others, specifically two exes who turned into friends. Fine by me, he wants to read boring chatlogs and do what I viewed initially as wasting his time by doing so. 

He saw me giving relationship advice to them. He saw me saying how much I appreciated him. He saw me talking about stupid shit like cat pictures and shared scientific articles. A little over two weeks in, he quit reading our conversations. Why? His need to know that I wasn't wronging him was sated. He told me he felt guilty for ever suspecting me in the first place, and that reading my conversations with others made him love and appreciate me more, because I wasn't badmouthing him or taking our problems elsewhere to be solved, and spent the next few months trying to make up his breached feelings of trust to me. 

We weren't even married, just engaged. It *astounds* me you aren't willing to do something so simple to make your wife feel loved and secure in the relationship, and does indeed make me wonder if she wouldn't find unsavory things you've said to this female friend, about her, about the relationship, about your feelings, whatever. Because when you're theoretically sharing your life with someone, refusing to share something as stupid and trivial as chatlogs seems, as one other poster put it, not the hill to die on. Do you value setting your precedence over your wife's trust and perceived safety? The reason people are downvoting and pestering you about this particular line of reasoning so much is because it's petty and simple to fix, but you seem unwilling to do so and give off the air of *really* not wanting her to read your conversations with this other woman - naturally leading readers to question *why*. 

If you can't lend your wife peace of mind in such a simple, easy way as this... I don't know what to tell you. For me, letting him read my conversations and saving chatlogs for him to peruse was an incredibly simple way to lull a wounded beast back into a sense of safety, and it worked way faster than I thought it would. If I'd ""stood on principle of personal privacy"", God knows how his unfounded suspicions would have grown or morphed, or what effect they would have had on our relationship - but they'd not have been positive effects, that's for sure. 

You think your wife is mostly upset about the bounds of broken trust by you reading her text conversations - and you're probably right. But your comments seem to be discounting the likely idea that she's also at *least* a little upset that you've been able to read *her* conversations while you're denying *her* the ability to read *your* conversations. For all you know, she's also deeply upset at the unfairness of you putting up a Moral-Highground-Wall, on the other side of which you're talking about God-knows-what with a woman you said yourself in another comment reminds her of a girl who caused problems with your relationship in the past. 

You have a kid together. You have seven years together. This is something to martyr yourself on a sword over if you're in junior high, not as a mature adult. Please reconsider giving her peace of mind, or at least get the two of you into counseling, because between this hiccup and the communications problems you mentioned having in the past, the relationship's going nowhere good without both of you deciding to do your parts and make whatever concessions you can to make things better for both of you and by default, your child as well.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389309788.0,"My issue is you're not defining your terms.  

What is ""aggressive"" in this scenario?

There are times where my husband starts pawing at my ass or something and I'm not in the mood so I kind of ignore it, but if he keeps at it I realize, ""Oh, he really wants sex.""  And I start to wonder if I'd be interested in having sex or not.  And sometimes he'll keep it up and make out with me in a really hot way and I'll realize, hey, I'm getting into this.

Is that what your SO means?

Because in that case, not being met with acceptance is not the same as outright rejection.  If you take her not ripping your clothes off at the moment you start showing interest as rejection, and as a result get pouty, yeah, that's a huge turn off.  I'm not saying to sexually harrass her either, though.  You've gotta gauge her response as you try to seduce her and not necessarily give up if she doesn't show interest right away.  She might be one of those people (there's lots of us!) who really want to feel wanted to get turned on. A lazy ass grab says ""I want sex cuz I'm horny"" - it comes across as selfish.  Actually trying to turn her on turns it into  ""I want YOU so badly I can barely stand it!"" which may be what she means when she says you need to be more aggressive.

I hope I'm being clear.  If she's outright rejecting any advance - swatting your hand away, saying no, etc - then she's just playing games/making excuses.

But getting cranky/pouty when rejected is always a turn off.  If you don't want obligation sex, don't react that way, it puts her in a hard place as AsAlwaysItDepends mentions in their comment.  If she's afraid you'll get difficult if she doesn't get turned on right away, you're creating a situation filled with anxiety, and anxiety is the killer of libido."

I don't mean say you should push past clear non-consent.  I'm just saying, from my perspective, laughing doesn't mean she's not interested, it means she feels awkward in that moment.  Try showing her how much you want her by being able to deal with that awkwardness anyway.  If she makes it clear she's not interested by saying ""No"" or ""not now"" then absolutely stop.  But don't take a laugh as rejection.  That's her showing that she feels awkward, it's not a rejection.

An educated Atheist will most likely argue that Atheism is the default position. That until evidence is available for the existence of God, the true position would be disbelief. For example, if I said I have jersey signed by Wayne Rooney saying ""You are my favorite fan. I love you -Wayne Rooney"", you probably wouldn't believe me until I showed you the jersey, or some sort of proof that I have such a jersey. 

Now with Atheism its similar. Atheist do not believe in God. Atheist do not believe there is no God. Atheism is not a belief, its not having a belief. So Atheists don't have to disprove God's existence, because they don't believe that there is no God. They just don't hold in a belief in God. Does that make sense?

gazork_chumble_spuzz,feminisms,1389310477.0,"I have been thinking about this in the 4+ hours since I wrote my last reply. I think I understand the problem.

We are both using definitions that aren't adequate for the scope of the problem.

I thought about it and realized something: it seems to me like there are two different kinds of racism. There is institutional racism, the kind of systemic oppression that pervades a society - prejudice plus power, as you said. But there is a second kind of racism, and that is individual racial prejudice, the hate that an individual feels for members of a particular group, for whatever reason. 

You are correct that people in a minority group *cannot* practice the first kind of racism (prejudice + power), and my definition didn't quite capture the difference between that one and individual prejudice. But individual prejudice fuels institutional oppression - it would not exist were it not for the racism that already existed in the hearts of the people who have the power to enforce that oppression.

&gt;My problem right now is that you assume I don't see a problem with that.

It's not that I think you have no problem with that - it's that you have continually minimized it, as if it doesn't really count as racist because of things like historical oppression or current oppression that the person faces from their society in general. Under your definition it would not, I suppose, but the kind of racism you describe is not the only kind that exists. Prejudice plus power would not exist without prejudice...and minorities are still fully capable of having all the prejudice of an oppressive minority. The fact that it isn't backed by power makes it less of a ""threat"", if I can use that word, but it doesn't make it any less racist, any less repugnant, any less wrong."

Pity? No. Recognition that the owners took on a huge amount of risk in starting the business I work for? Yes. Grateful that in 2014 I have a job? Yes. I have family who own small businesses and you think the people who work for them-- and might not be employed otherwise-- are upset that these people took the risk to open a business?

&gt; But you can't leave. Because you need money. Good god...

Since I've worked at my job, I've had 5 recruiters try to get me to leave and come work for them. I can leave any time I want... but I don't. I enjoy my job, it's fulfilling and pays well. Why would I want to leave, outside of an adolescent understanding of how business and life actually works?


&gt; Again, its to protect you from your employer. Working that much is proven to be unhealthy.

I'm an adult and can decide when I've worked enough. My last job I was overworked, so I left. Others did the same. It self-regulates. At my current job I don't work nearly as much and still have time for dating, friends, cooking, hobbies, going to the gym and traveling. Again, who the fuck are you to set my hours? What other parts of my life do you want to legislate? What other parts of my life do I need the State's interference in?

&gt; I'd rather prove my own value
&gt; Bullshit.

Do you not understand how sales works? Have you ever held a job?

I bring in lots of business. I get commission based on what I bring in. I make even more money. If not in sales, I have good ideas, put in good work and prove that I'm a valuable employee, giving me leverage to either move up or leave. 

Hence I prove my value in sales on a daily basis and am thus rewarded.


&gt; Nobody would do that you idiot.

Google ""GM"". You think it's sustainable for people to put bolts on a truck for $80,000 a year with no other skills or education? Why do you think this shit gets outsourced?

&gt; You can't quit! Because you need money!

And I voluntarily work at my job. So I can leave for another or start my own business. So, yes, I can quit.


&gt; Because you can't handle it yourself! You cannot force your employer to give you more money!

Again, I work in sales. Do you not understand how sales works? How about commission? In most any job you can ask for a raise yourself. Unless you're a horribly incompetent human being who sucks at their job, you can negotiate a raise.

Here's how it works, something you may never actually understand. You prove your value in a job. You receive a raise after negotiating with your employer that you offer value and require the additional money. If not? You leave, leverage your experience and get more money.


I honestly can't tell if you're a 14 year old who is practicing with anarchism or socialism, but honestly your lack of understanding of work, value and negotiations is startling.

we're a growing garden supply company (we supply stores like home depot) so we are based in an old GM factory with a few other companies. We had to upsize our floor space which meant they took a big saw and cut through a wall in a few spaces and we rented the room beyond.  Now, the room sat empty for a little while as it was decided HOW to use it, and it got brought up to code for the fire system.   
One of the managers noticed a female employee had been seen recently, so he took a stroll around, and walked back there. he found her in the corner of a 20,000 sq.ft. room, with her shoes off, smoking crack. she was literally the only thing in the room at that time."

dirtyewok,coys,1389310733.0,"&gt; If Siggy isn't going to play this season, I'm sure Swans would love to take him back for another spell on loan.

I think Laudrop actually said today that Swans need to bring in 2 players on loan than can have the impact that Siggy did when he was on loan.

I like Siggy but he is very much along the same lines as Dempsey in that we just don't play in a manner (that we have seen) where his skills will ever actually be used effectively.  It makes him a square peg in a round hole for us.

Holtby's skills may be easier to come across than Siggy's, but he is also better suited to be used in our way of playing.

The thing that has me slightly weary about all of this would be the idea of calling Carroll back from loan and sending either (or both) Siggy/Holtby out on loan.  Carroll has potential to be very good but needs regular time to progress and just like Siggy/Holtby he will be down the pecking order in our midfield.  It would make more sense to keep Siggy/Holtby in house and have them play while Carroll is getting regular minutes for QPR and then make decisions in the Summer one who stays/goes when we determine if Sherwood is the manager or we opt for someone like LVG.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,feminisms,1389311146.0,"&gt;according to your definition of prejudice person B is in the wrong. 

Yes, they are, because unless/until person A has actively done something to warrant that kind of reaction, person B is treating them in a manner that is inappropriate. If we examine person B's past, their reaction might be understandable; we might well have reason to pity person B for something they suffered which made them react so strongly. That doesn't make their behaviour any less inappropriate, and person A is still innocent and undeserving of being shunned.

&gt;To conclude, kids on a reservation not wanting to play with the white children which might hurt their feelings is in no way comparable to the systematic genocide which has been perpetuated against native peoples in the Americas for the last 500+ years.

Systemic oppression is not the only form racism can take. And that systemic oppression/genocide is fueled by the same kind of racial prejudice that shuns and hates a family for no reason other than the colour of their skin. The oppression is what you get when that prejudice is allowed free reign - and while a minority group lacks the power to enforce their racial prejudice on others, they are still fully capable of feeling the hateful prejudice (racism) against another group of people. Prejudice plus power isn't the only kind of racism. 

And it's ignorant to totally invalidate someone's experiences with racism because it wasn't as bad as it could have been.

Banner_Free,Frugal,1389311602.0,"&gt; their website boasts no annual contracts? Is that true?

Yes. The explanation requires a little background:

Let's say you sign up for ATT/Sprint/Verizon service, and they offer you an iPhone 5S (or Galaxy S4 or Lumia 928 or whatever) for $200. You're not actually getting a $600+ device for $200. You pay $200 up front, and the remainder of the device cost is baked into your monthly service cost. This is why they have two-year contracts and early termination fees: to prevent you from signing up, getting a $200 iPhone, and leaving after a month.

T-Mobile does it differently, by treating the phone and the service as completely separate items. Here's an example of how that might work:

First, you decide what level of service you want. Let's say you want unlimited talk/text/web, with throttled data after 2.5GB. That's $60/mo.

Then, you decide what you want to do for a phone. If you have a compatible phone you want to keep, you can pop in your T-Mo SIM card and you're all set.

If you want to buy a new phone, you can either buy it outright or finance it over 24 months (typically with $0-100 down payment). An iPhone 5S, for example, is $25/mo for 24 months with $0 down.

The device financing is the closest they come to a contract. If you cancel your T-Mo service before you've fully paid for your phone, you do have to pay the remaining balance.

&gt; If I am looking to get out of my Sprint contract and go to Republic Wireless, what is stopping me from going with T-Mobile for a few months then dropping them for RW?

Nothing. You would have to do two things, though:

First, buy a T-Mobile phone to use for those few months (I'd buy a cheap used one from a site like [Swappa](http://www.swappa.com) ).

Second, buy a Republic Wireless phone when you switch to RW, as you can only use their approved phones on that network."

This isn't quite an answer to your question, but as a person who is used to drinking black tea with milk and sugar, I've had success reducing my sugar intake by simply by reducing the amount of sugar I put in my tea gradually. There is no need to go cold turkey.

There is a Japanese tea called [hōjicha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hojicha), which is basically roasted Japanese green tea. I've found it to be a good medium between green and black tea. Like green tea, it is drank without sugar. However, the overall flavour is a bit more close to black tea than many green teas, making it perhaps a bit more to my taste. It isn't as strong as black tea, so milk sugar is not necessary. Hōjicha isn't that expensive, either."

A few days after hiring him, I get a phone call at one in the morning from a local cop. He's at the gas station and no one is there.  He walked through the entire store and nothing.  This cop was a nice guy and was genuinely concerned that something bad had happened to this guy.  I go in and check the cameras.

piggybankcowboy,amateurradio,1389311964.0,"There's a Wiki page on the sidebar that is chock full of the info you seek. I've only been around for little over a year, and I can already tell you that there is no end to new stuff to learn, or directions you can take the hobby. 

I feel that it's hard to talk expense without knowing what you plan to do. What I recommend is reading the heck out of the Wiki to get an idea of the types of questions you need to ask. I could tell you that you can get into radio for less that $100, but at that point, we're talking about you passing the technician class test, and getting a $50+/- handy-talkie so you can jump on your local repeaters. Not that there's anything wrong with that, since that is *exactly* how I got into radio. 

One thing you can do is start looking online for local radio clubs in your area. The sooner you get into contact with them, the better, as they are likely who you'll be taking your exams with anyway. They are also the folks that will be running your local repeaters if you go that route, and it's even possible that an elmer (a ham who's got lots of experience, basically) will take you under his or her wing. If they have events or meetings, ask if it's cool to show up even though you're unlicensed, so you can learn learn learn. 

I cannot stress that word enough. *Learn.* Don't just memorize the test questions. Learn the principles, the physics, and at the very least the operation of the tech. There are multiple study guides to help you do this, some are free, some are not. I believe the Wiki lists a few (I have not looked at it in awhile). 

I guess the short answer of how it breaks down is this; if you've got $100, you can afford to get into ham radio. The test will cost you $14, a radio $30-$60, and $30 for the ARRL license manual for technician level licensing. That is, in my opinion, the absolute bare minimum to get in. 

However, that won't be enough to quench your thirst if you really find radio interesting. Trust me. I want to do about a hundred things that my wallet just won't allow...yet. So I made a Rainy Day Radio Fund that I toss money into whenever I can, and my interest only keeps growing as I continue to save and explore. Really, the sky's the limit. Well, unless you want to contact the ISS, then I guess low-earth orbit is the limit.

Lokipi,chess,1389311993.0,"Hi there, hope you are still checking this AMA, Im a little late to the party.

Chess.com is the main site I use to play on, and i suppose that speaks for itself in terms of quality, the one fault I find is that some games get really repetitive as I see the same openings over and over again. Really the only thing I would change is adding a few more game modes into the mix.

Although it would be challenging to accomplish. I think a community driven section of the site where people can suggest new game modes would be great as it eliminates reliance on opening theory and puts the focus back on pure skill, maybe some kind of  rolling replacement system where the game mode would only last for a month or 2 and keep only the really popular ones permanently.  I would definitely get upgrade my membership to support something like that.

A couple of modes i would love to see. Chess 960 is an obvious one, very fun and im sure it would be popular.
Another I have always wanted to play online would be a mode where the board is set up in an equal position from a GM games, so you play on from a complex position.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389312277.0,"I think it boils down to my own totally unscientific idea of chemistry.

When you guys were newly in the relationship, you had this thing that poly people call ""new relationship energy"" although I prefer the old term infatuation.  It's a crazy chemical cocktail that makes you do crazy things.

When that wears off you're left with something else.  A sexually successful long term relationship will go through ups and downs as everyone has natural libido fluctuations, but what you describe isn't that.  It sounds like you two literally have no chemistry anymore.

It could be fixable.  Our emotions influence our brain chemistry which influences how our genitals respond.  There's all sorts of feedback loops that go on.  It's absolutely possible to reignite a spark in a dead bedroom when both partners have reasonable libidos and want to do so.  You guys might be good candidates for a 'sex challenge' where you agree to have SOME kind of sexual activity with each other - note I didn't say PIV or intercourse - every day for a set period of time.

But you just also might not be sexually compatible in a chemical sense.  I know this sounds all ""woo woo"" new age but I'm convinced there's a serious biological element.  Dan Savage has referred to as ""liking how your partner's spit tastes.""  That's kind of weird, but it makes sense to me.  There's something about my partner, at a basic level, that turns me on like crazy.  The scent right around his mouth.  The smell at the back of his neck.  He has a similar thing for me although it's in different regions and I'm not going to share that here.  Point being: despite ups and downs in our libidos there's something basic, biological, and chemical that keeps us coming back for more with each other.

You have to figure out if you guys have that or not.  I am really convinced that LTRs that are sexually happy most of the time have this basic component.  But emotions, resentments, and failed sex can get in the way of that, too.  You have to try to rediscover each other sexually to see if you can get it back, or if you're just better off being great friends.  "

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389312304.0,"I don't know that there's much I can do as an actual romantic interest. As a platonic *friend* or family member I think it's good for me to help keep these guys a bit more grounded. Resentful men often have trouble seeing women as real people because they don't have many strong connections with women, so I think supportive platonic relationships help a lot. 

When guys I know in that way (family members, etc.) have gone on similar tirades, I think my influence as an actual woman who cares about them and happens to know the types of women they want to get with has been helpful. I can interrogate their assumptions without making them feel threatened and give them some perspective from the other side. I can also help them remember that those women are complex individuals just like I am. Sometimes flipping things around helps - anything from ""How would you feel if some guys said that about me?"" to ""What if a woman you weren't attracted to walked up to you and did that? Would you date her?"" or ""So are you obligated to take out [woman I know they aren't attracted to]?"" That kind of stuff.

For men who are actually trying to pursue me when I'm not interested in them, I honestly can't think of anything outside of being kind to them. And if they're being jerks about it...I don't know, maybe direct feedback would help. Like, ""You know that's really rude, right?"" or ""OK, doing that does not make me want to call you.""

But honestly, I think the thing these guys want from women they're attracted to is for those women to return their attraction, and anything other than that is going to feed their resentment on some level.

EDIT: I also find that they are usually much, much, much more likely to listen to men than they are women when it comes to their attitude."

I started crying when I was reading them, and continued up until I walked out of my house. I'm super emotional and I know if we don't talk it out, it'll get worse. 

If you're already paranoid and get jealous easily, talking it out with him after what you saw him writing back and forth with her is unlikely to soothe those traits over altogether, regardless of what he says to you about the situation. I'm not saying don't talk it out with him, I'm just saying I've seen a lot of friends in your shoes, and the ones who left the guys (and girls) that gave reason to ignite those feelings in them (like yours did) did a lot better in the long run than those who stayed as long as they could stand it and tried to fight intrinsic parts of their nature in the face of a deceitful partner. 

He didn't even tell you about a wedding to which he invited another girl. He *knows* you want to go places with him but blows it off. He's telling some other woman he loves her and that she's beautiful, for crying out loud. If you stay with this guy, will you honestly ever stop wondering if he's still telling her these things? Or worse, new female friends who come into his life? 

There's a lot of solid advice in these comments, and I hope you listen to it. Having libido incompatibilities and self-esteem issues... I honestly hope you split from this guy and seek out professional therapy to help build your self-esteem to the point where, if someone ever tries to pull this same shit on you in the future, you don't even have to wonder if it's worth staying because you'll immediately recognize that it isn't. You've put in eight months already - please don't give your future self the opportunity to regret putting in any more.

I think it's kind of shitty to take table scraps from a show that wants to mess with fans but is inherently cowardly.  I have no problem with people writing fic (other than the fact that most fanfic is poorly written) or wanting to see these things in the show, I just find it annoying when people act as if something that is NOT happening in the show and is in fact just played for laughs is an actual thing.

Sherlock and John aren't in a romantic relationship and there's a 99.9% chance that canonically they won't be.  So it's not a poly situation.  Poly people who want to see themselves represented in the media shouldn't pretend that something that jokes about it is actual representation and should instead support - or create - media that is actually poly.

Practice making budgets and sticking to them. You're young, so it's OK to be wrong. Figure out where any budgeting mistakes lie and learn how to fix them. If you can graduate with 4 years experience in managing your finances you'll be years ahead of most of your classmates. /r/personalfinance is a great resource for any questions you have.

For the love of all things holy stay out of credit card debt. Learn to use credit responsibly. Pay your bill in full and on time at the end of every billing period. You don't want to be paying off freshman year fun when you're 30.

Anyone who forms their opinion on the basis of a program on a channel synonymous with somewhat exploitative reality TV arent going to be swayed in their belief however erroneous by opinion pieces on a left wing blog or in the guardian. Calling attention to something that's courting controversy has two effects. one, getting everyone in the same mind feeling all self congratulatory which doesn't achieve anything other than a liberal afterglow. Two, it increases publicity and gets the producers who came up with this shit rewarded for their endeavors with a nice ratings spike, reinforcing channel 4's obsession with making the programing equivalent of bilge water.

Additionally, the police would have some trouble questioning or arresting a suspect with only anonymously provided evidence. And they certainly can't get a search warrant with anonymous evidence, unless there's something independent to verify its authenticity.

True, true. However, my complaint is more about how gorgeous dramas like *NagiAsu* or *Kyousougiga* couldn't even beat *Blazblue*, which is as phoned-in, ugly and incoherent a video adaptation as I've ever seen (ironic, considering the endcard for the first episode was Tomokazu Sugita saying this anime will break the curse of shitty fighting game adaptations.) It really felt like ArkSys just threw some cash and a few copies of the videogames at whatever studio they could scrounge up who wasn't busy, and then told them to go make something. And *NagiAsu* and *Kyousougiga* couldn't even beat *that*? C'mon, man...

And I'd honestly love to buy DVD's, but being the broke-ass motherfucker I am, I really can't put my wallet where my mouth is. You have no idea how much my trigger finger itched when I saw *Birdy the Mighty: S.A.V.E edition* was on sale on Amazon for like $20; I've had to save every penny I can.
"
piggybankcowboy,amateurradio,1389314283.0,"The exams are generally offered by radio clubs with permission to do so. There are three levels: technician, general and extra. They go from basic knowledge in both radio physics and law to advanced knowledge in the order I listed them. I should note that there is no required classes that you have to take. You can study on your own, and take the exam, or, if classes are offered, you can opt into them. Up to you. 

Basically you're under the umbrella of the FCC. I can't say the government makes a lot of money off hams, unless we're violating rules and being fined for it. The ARRL is an organization that helps shape the laws and policies that effect us and allow us to do what we do. A very simple way to look at is that the government needs to protect the airwaves for various reasons, so if we're going to use them, we need to know what we're doing. 

The ARRL puts out the licensing manuals, which I highly recommend investing in. It's an extra expense, I know, but worth it for verified information. After all, you never know what you're getting on the Internet. That said, there are indeed a number of wonderful study guides out there put out by other folks, and prices may vary. 

When you get licensed, you get a call sign, which is a series of letters and numbers that identifies you as you, and you must use this call sign when on the air. You also get an actual paper copy of the license, which you must produce should you ever be asked for it by an official. Without a license, the *only* thing you can do in radio is listen. "

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389314433.0,"&gt;In the formation of many of these countries, there were disputes, which are still going on today: the UN created 2 states--Israel and Palestine. War began less than a day later, and has been continuing, on and off, since.

It actually was a longer conflict throughout the late 1940s.  Post-war the Civil War in Mandatory Palestine escalated between the Jews, Arabs, and British, followed by a UN vote, the British effectively withdrew from the civil war, Israel declared independence, and full-on war broke out. Obviously one-sentence summaries gloss over things by necessity, but I think given OP's question it's worthwhile to point out the scale and duration of this conflict."

I do take note that the people who most often obsess over clothes being worn/scream about it the loudest in this situation are going to be the likes of the Salafi, as I said, or conservative Islamists, or otherwise people trending towards being overly conservative in general. In that vein, I certainly don't agree with the conservative Islamist's ideas of narrowly defining ""what's acceptable for society"" or their saying ""all of X group really should dress like this"" or whatever.

Otherwise, I'd actually really love to see a loose, bare minimal dress code where I live, at least to stop people dressing like slobs or from trying to look attractive and failing and looking tacky or slutty instead. People should try to dress well whenever they're able to, and that if someone wants to make themselves look more attractive through dress then they should do it in a classy way.

EByrne,AskMen,1389314453.0,"I couldn't even begin to put myself in the head of a 40-50 year old woman who's been married for half of her life and is looking for a divorce, but just as a general sentiment, I would be extremely suspicious of anyone who was so back-and-forth, without explanation, about whether a 22 year marriage was worth saving. 

Even if it isn't an affair, that probably just means that she figured she could ditch you and go find some hot guy to have a good time with. She probably ignored the simple reality that men tend to do better in the dating world after age 40, but as the expiration date got closer she finally had to take an honest look at the situation.

I hate the idea of giving any kind of advice here, since I'm a 20-something guy who's never been married. I just haven't lived enough to put myself in your shoes, and I have no idea what my opinion on this would be if I had another 20+ years and a marriage under my belt. 

So instead I'd just say to trust yourself and don't over-think this. From what you posted, it sounds like she had no problem wounding you pretty deeply and discarding you without a second thought when she thought it would be advantageous to her. And maybe I'm reading way too far into the tone of your post, but it sounds like you think you deserve better than that and are confident that you can find better than that. 

And anecdotally, I can assure you that you can and will be okay. My father was in a similar situation a few years back, after my mom had an affair and left him and after the last of his kids was out of the house. He was a stable, well-employed, fit, kind-hearted guy with some well-raised, grateful kids to show for his parenting efforts. And he does *really* well on the dating scene, because why wouldn't he?

For a while I wanted to kind of gently let her know that maybe that dress might not be the most flattering on her (I found her attractive, but I figured that it wasn't how other people wanted fat women to look).

Eventually, though, what I realized was basically this:

good on her for having the balls to wear what *she* liked. A lot of people, of either gender, and of any size, could learn a few lessons from that. Who's to say what's ""flattering"" and what isn't? Doesn't that depend on which traits you want to highlight? On what you want to look like? If a person feels comfortable, and feels that they look good in a certain outfit, then why on Earth should they *not* wear it? What's ""appropriate"", and what's ""flattering"" is subjective, and why not let the person wearing the clothes make that call? It's certainly not something random people on the street should get to decide for you. Who cares what *they* think? 

And, ultimately, my ex was fat. She knew it, I knew it. We were both ok with it. So why should she dress as if her being fat was some terrible secret that should be hidden as much as possible?

For me it took some getting used to this line of thinking, but I'm glad I did. If she felt good about her body, and I liked it too, why would either of us care that she wasn't wearing clothes that fat people are ""conventionally"" supposed to wear in order to look smaller or, let's be honest, to make them less noticeable?

Of course, it is somewhat different in that my ex knew perfectly well what she looked like, and had just decided not to give a damn and dress how she wanted, whereas your wife might not fully realize how she looks in those clothes (so if she is confronted with it from someone less friendly than you, she might be in for a rude awakening). But still, it may be worth considering this angle.

And as many others have said, there probably isn't a good way of breaking it to her in any case."

I'm no expert in software, but my father, who is an expert, basically espouses establishing a solid process with many checks, preventing nasty surprises. Set a budget, break things down into definable milestones, and keep the client updated on whether you're on/behind schedule. Try to forecast problems and setbacks, and mention them to the client. For example, ""I started working on X, and it's apparent this is going to require more time than expected, pushing the deadline and budget to a and b.""

TheBishop7,TheMassive,1389315193.0,"It's really hard to say *exactly* what position Higuaín plays. The fact is he's somewhere in between an attacking central midfielder and a center forward. Or at least that's how he started the game the last year and a half. His position also seems to change drastically depending on where he is needed due to the scoreline and the opposition.

We depend on him far too much. Berhalter needs to figure out how to use him effectively without overly depending on him. Anor and Trapp have proved reliable in my mind and I think Arrieta and Oduro both show flashes of brilliance, but cannot be depended on (yet) if the supporting staff is not perfect.

It was common that we lost the games in which we were the better team on the pitch. Unfortunately the opposite does not hold true. This, in my mind, is due to the fact that we have one weapon with a *decent* support system that had too many variables. We need to sign someone who can either be a strong, dependable support, or defer the attack away from Higuaín. That, or Berhalter needs to tinker with the formation. In my opinion, both need to happen.

Also, I know you were joking, but Arrieta has gotten his offside behavior very much under control. For the type of player he is, 1.14 offside calls/90 minutes played is really not bad enough to complain about. In 2012, however, he averaged 2.41 offside calls/90 minutes played. That said, he had 9 goals and 4 assists last season compared to 3 goals and 4 assists this season. And he played over 300 more minutes this season. In 2012 the only person who averaged more offsides/minutes was Marco Di Vaio and it was by a slim margin. This season Di Vaio was offside *36 more times* than the next player. Maybe Jairo should be offside *more* in 2014."

dewprisms,changemyview,1389315338.0,"I worked at a large regional grocery store (about 215 stores). Every week they would send giant batches of price changes that were pushed down from corporate to the stores. The tags were on giant sheets that needed to be torn into individual tags (I think 7x7 or so?) and the sheets were already perforated. If a store put an item on sale themselves, lost a tag, or needed to replace a tag, they could print them in store the same way you described.

Because hundreds, if not thousands, of items price change on a weekly basis, they would print batches of all the sale items and ship them out to each store, along with the paper signs for special ad items that needed to have special displays built, etc. The tags and signage came with the other inter store mail.

They could theoretically send files to stores that they adjust and then print themselves, but that would require new specialty printers to be outfitted in each store, to install the software used to create those tags at corporate in each individual office (often on shitty old computers that can't handle a lot to begin with) plus training all the scan coordinators on the new software.

The scan coordinator who made sure all pricing in the store was correct, made signs and tags that needed updating, applied the batches of changes in the computer system, etc. full time, solely printing that many tags in store would take an absurd amount of time, and potentially a second employee to assist with the work."

Pogglewoggle,SkincareAddiction,1389315360.0,"Not sure about the redness but for scars I've been using a gel called ""Contractubex"" since I've been a teenager (in the early 90s). I had a very deep flesh wound on my arm after falling onto broken glass. The wound had to be fixed with 12 stitches. I remember the stitches got even infected because I went swimming. The scar nevertheless healed very quickly and it was completely flat within a year. Today you can hardly see 3 tiny discolored dots (from the needle) and some smooth stretched skin which is only really visible close up and when I'm tanned as it is a bit lighter. But most importantly is that it is absolutely flat which will be important for your face. By comparison, my cousin had nearly the same wound at the same age and she has a very deep indent and her stitches a very visible. She hadn't been using such a gel but her skin is also lighter as mine.

I finished up the tube of Contractubex for my acne scars and I don't have any deep dents from the scars. As a teenager, I was approximately 3 times per year for 2 weeks exposed to extreme sun, saltwater and beach sand which probably could be counted as some sort of dermabrasion treatment, too. Usually my skin would be very even and balanced after spending a few weeks at the beach.

With audio it really comes down to being really CPU intensive. Something with an i7 would be best, but he could make due with a 2.4 GHz i5.

What audio work is he planning on doing? If he's just wanting to record and mix then 4gb of ram will be fine. If he is wanting to use a lot of software samplers/instruments though then he should look into something with 8gb. Although he could make due with 4.

One thing that is important is he'll want a second hard drive. Pro Tools doesn't like recording on the hard drive it's installed on. An external USB 2.0 hard drive will work but I'd strongly recommend USB 3.0/fire wire/thunder bolt/express port. Also the hard drive should spin at 7200 rpm. I've never tried recording to a drive that was 5400 but I've heard a lot of issues.

With all that being said if he's planning on never tracking more then 2 tracks at once and never mixing a song that has more then 24 tracks then you can get by with a pretty low setup. An i5, 4gb ram, tracking to an external hard drive connected by USB 2.0 would work fine. Although even then shelling out extra for something with an i7 would still be worth it."

techlos,LSD,1389315851.0,"LSD will have either no taste, or a slight bitter taste from ink. If you swallow the tab, it'll still be active. 2cb won't fit in a tab.
Any of the nbome's (25b, 25i, etc) will be inactive if swallowed, and makes your mouth numb.

As for effects - extremely subjective. For me, LSD comes in gentle waves, has a peak an hour or two long, then gently fades. Total time around 12 hours. 25i-nbome is similar to LSD, but much less introspective and much more visual imo. 2cb lasts a shorter time, and ramps up and down smoothly in intensity. 2cb also has a similar ""magic"" compared to MDMA, and you're likely to love everyone and everything on it (although trips can always go bad).

EDIT: I looked up what you are talking about and it appears that the theory is that herbivores need large guts, both for digesting vegetables and to get enough energy from relatively low-calorie food sources, which requires energy. This energy = less energy for brain development.

But today things are different. As the poster above me said, we can get all of our nutrients and calorie needs through our foods, vegan or not. Our digestive systems would work the same either day."

Can you count how many times saying that to an angry person calmed them down? I think it's understandable why someone would get angry at what's happening to her. I know I would. I'm pretty sure you would too. While she does work for a corporation, she is also a human.

Kylde didn't only forward her profile to an Admin. He publicly stated he reported her. Granted, I don't really frequent these parts of Reddit, but who does it benefit publicly announcing that you reported a user to the admins? How would you feel if it was publicly stated you were reported to the admins? Probably bad. I get the vibe that etiquette recommends not publicly announcing those reports. I could be wrong.

You can say how you'd act... but until it happens, don't act so high. Feelings get hurt, your character gets insulted, and emotions sweep over. She's not being an ass over nothing. She's visibly upset for an understandable reason--a reason many, many people would be upset over. She's a person, not a company.

* The gap between S2 &amp; S3, as you've so eloquently mentioned, is 2 years - both in real time and in canon. This is the pay-off for those watching since the summer of 2010, and it's clear to see how the fans have had an impact on the show itself.

As another example you can look at Brazil where there are 28+ unofficial categories when it comes to skin color. [Wikipedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_Brazil#Controversy)

Racial categories are arbitrary at times as well and often were used to discriminate or promote groups in a less civilized period of our history. In America we went through an era in which only 'whites' could own property, so many groups petitioned the government to be considered 'white' (good example is the Syrian American population making all 'arabs' into caucasians).  We also had/have a brief but ongoing discussion of whether or not President Obama is black/black enough. This goes back to the cultural aspect (""acting white"")

The reason I felt emasculated was because I was insecure and here was a woman hitting the subjects of my insecurity (the social stuff, not size) with laser precision. What's more, she did it with impunity, knowing that there was nothing I could do to stop her or hurt her back. She was accompanied by two men that would take her side.

That day, I felt *impotent* more than anything else because I was powerless to stop her or even respond. 

I'm glad I didn't do or say anything to her.

Now I don't look back on that and feel emasculated because of her words, but because I let the words affect me. I've matured a lot since then, she was just a bitch, probably trying to impress one of those guys by humiliating me. "

YoungFolks,asktransgender,1389317326.0,"* When you learned what ""transgender"" is

I've known since middle school, when I learned about the LGBT community at large.

* Figuring out when you would officially label yourself as transgender

About 3 months ago. I honestly had no clue I was trans, despite presenting and prefering to be treated like a guy for the past couple years.

* What you did after labeling yourself as transgender

Research the shit out of it, and do tons of questioning and introspection. Tried to figure out what I wanted. How far to take the transition. Came out to some poeople, talked to people, talked to a counselor, bought a binder. 

* How has becoming transgender affected your relationships?

Not much really. Those who know sometimes have trouble using the right name/pronoun, and they'll ask me questions, but they treat me the same. Which is good - they treat me like me. 

* What is your current state? Are you happy with it?

As full-time as I can get with no medical intervention or being out to my family. The medical will hopefully change soon. I'm happy, but also really nervous and occassionally plagued by doubts. 

* Where do you want to be in your transgender life? (Certain body features, attributes, relationships, etc.)

I want hormones. I really want stubble, a deep voice, male muscle development and fat distribution. I want to get to a point that new people I meet have no idea I'm not a cis dude unless I or someone else tell them. I want the world to treat me like any other guy. I want good friends to stay good friends, and I wanna make more good friends. I'm asexual and aromantic, so I don't really want a romantic partner or sex.

Special education is just not physical disabilities and children with profound deficits. It's also for children with learning disabilities (who may actually have a 160 IQ), children with behavioural problems, etc. 

A child with dyslexia and is extremely smart, for example, could have two outcomes: 

1. Does not receive any special education, and in turn, becomes so frustrated with school that they eventually drop out of high school and therefore have few job prospects in their adult life (obviously worst case scenario here people...). 

or

2. Gets their dyslexia diagnosed, and eventually reads close to or at their grade level. They flourish and their grades rise as a result of the extra help, and are able to handle post secondary endeavors when the time comes.

Yahbo,AskMen,1389317644.0,"My very first girlfriend completely destroyed me while hanging with a couple of our friends one night. We were fresh out of high school (i was late to the girlfriend scene surprise surprise) and her and her friend came over to my friends apartment to hang out with me and him. We were all drinking and me and her kept slipping off to the bedroom to fool around a bit. But her friend kept pulling her back because she apparently didn't like my friend and couldn't just make conversation for a while.

We eventually ran out of booze but there were some 20something guys across the street drinking beer in the back of their truck. Her and her friend got the bright idea that they would go hang out with those guys for a minute to get some beers. I didn't like the idea and told her so (in retrospect it was a very whiney begging way that I went about it). We got in some sort of argument over it but they did it anyway, then she called up her weed guy and had him bring some pot over for her and her friend and told me to go away or he wouldn't give it to them. As if I weren't already emasculated enough at this point basically witnessing my first girlfriend throw her self out there to guys right in front of me for booze and weed. She then smoked the weed and spent the rest of the night being super mean and saying hurtful things to me and basically talking shit about me with her friend. We crashed for the night, woke up so hung over that I walked her and her friend to her ""friends cousins house"" about 2 miles away and then walked back to the apartment and slept it off.

She then cut all communications with me for about 2 or 3 years, wouldn't answer the phone or respond to any sorts of messages I would send her. I started smoking a pack a day and my social anxiety shot through the roof for quite some time after this.

The worst part of it looking back on the whole thing is how horribly I acted. I mean sure she did some really shitty things that night, but when I imagine that night... I get more mad at myself for not having any self respect or dignity than I get at her for being an immature asshole."

While he ~~must~~ most certainly harmed you, a mental disability must regularly impede the person's daily life. His dissatisfaction with his marriage could very well be enough for him to act in a way he might not normally act, but does not warrant enough to be considered a mental issue. 

Instead of seeking companionship from someone else, he should have talked to his wife and/or gotten them in couples counseling. Again, I have no intimate knowledge of him or what transpired.

I can't say that it's often been an issue for me in Buffy though. Off the top of my head scenes that I feel it in: Willow and Veruca at the courtyard table, Harmony trying to hook Cordelia up with Big Gulp Jonathan, many of Xander's inane and immature jokes. I also used to get extremely embarrassed in every scene where SMG had to run and wished she looked more badass and athletic, but I had a recent realization that this is likely exactly what Joss intended; the whole point was for this small blonde girl, who runs all gangly, weak and helpless-like, to not be what she seems. That's all I can come up with in 5 minutes. 

Unrelated to vicarious embarrassment, but I found out from this sub that Him is an unpopular episode but I loved it. The timing of the episode was a hilarious and welcome breather from all the serious business going on.

StarHeadedCrab,AskWomen,1389319427.0,"I'm asking for your ideas, but;

My opinion: Give some indication as to why they weren't attracted (while still being polite) to give some direction to the self improvement you want to happen spontaneously. I think you should actually ""owe"" that if they ask. Even better (though not always practical for a stranger) would be to use the ""kiss, kick, kiss"" principle, where you would tell them things that you did like about them as well. Often this information is used as a threat, but it doesn't have to come out as a barrage of insults.

Also if women were more open about what they were and weren't attracted to (particularly the former). This would include the media as well as life in general. There isn't as much variety as idealists here would like to think, and it would be good if men could be aware of things more than vague words like ""confident"", especially if they were actually coming from women and not male PUAs.

Also more to emphasise that just because someone doesn't find you attractive doesn't mean that they think you're a bad person. Particularly within friendship groups, women need to be able to say to their male friends (who may be in the friendzone) that they don't find them attractive and exactly why; but there also needs to be a way to make it clear that changing won't change that particular person's opinion (although why that's a bad thing I'm still not entirely clear on, when it comes to things that are largely considered bad/dealbreakers and not just personal preferences).

Personally I would rather have the bulk of the new tax burden on personal property tax rather than business zoned areas, which would get a smaller increase, as both of those got direct benefits from the police over the past bunch of years causing the debt problem but the businesses weren't able to vote for the people running the deficit. My philosophy is that the people who probably currently own property voted for people who overly provided benefits without increasing taxes. It isn't that the police don't deserve the benefits that they are getting but if the people who live in the town then wanted to guarantee 10 years of premium retirement pensions then they should have prefunded for them. That way if the next generation(my generation) came in and thought those benefits we stupid we wouldn't still be on the hook for paying for them. Pretty much the entire country has gotten in the habit of having their cake and eating it too by offering pensions that they aren't prefunding and the transition to prefunding is doing to be extremely painful because it will have to happen almost all at once rather than over the 10+ years of employment.

irrational_abbztract,battlefield_4,1389319792.0,"Yeah. I've got two SSD (500GB and a 250GB).

As an example of the performance difference:

Windows boot time: HDD = 1.5 minutes. SSD = 10 seconds

BF4 Rush time until spawn: HDD = ~1 minute SSD= 10-15 seconds MAX.

Autodesk AutoCAD: HDD = 2 minutes. SSD = 10 seconds.   

With an SSD, you are essentially guaranteed a performance boost. An SSD, from a price to performance boost perspective, is the best possible upgrade.

It is ridiculous how much faster things open up but it is only obvious in things that would normally take a lot longer to start. So for something like opening up Chrome, you won't notice a big difference because its only reading a small amount of files anyways but if you look at the AutoCad or the boot times, you realize how much faster it is.

For BF4, if you're playing Rush or any other objective based matches, an SSD will allow you to capture a flag...while the rest of the players still wait to load the map from their HDD.. *That* is how significant the change can be."

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389319821.0,"I would caution you about buying any of it before the baby arrives.  Swings, bouncers, exersaucers, walkers, it's all stuff that will vary from baby to baby.  My suggestion is to start with a bassinet/moses basket/laundry basket and then go from there once you see what your baby likes.  

Some babies want to be held all the time, want you to keep moving and don't like to lay down on their own.  For those babies I'd recommend a wrap and a good swing.  For calm babies that don't mind being put down or mostly still, a bouncer/rocker will work just fine.  Some babies like to be upright vs laid out, some babies like more color and sound and distractions than others.  By the time you are looking at exersaucers and bouncers they are a little bigger and you can even take them to look at things and see which ones catch their attention.  

The exception here is that if you KNOW there is a particular activity you want to do with the baby, go ahead with that gear.  Things like baby carriers/wraps, strollers or bike trailers, you can research in advance what works best for the activity and that's what is most important.  But for day to day, what matters is what baby likes.  

Buying all of this stuff before getting to know the baby feels like being prepared, but it ends up being like someone else doing the shopping for your breast pump, glider, nursing bras, baby bath, carrier/wrap and travel system, all without ever consulting you.  Maybe they splurge on something you never use and cheap out on what you need the most.  I think most of us know how annoying those kinds of gifts can be, and it works the same for baby!

So that's my tip - procrastinate so baby can have some input.

Besides which, I don't want to deal with guys thinking that they can have another shot with me if they just change a couple of things.

And that's assuming that there is just one easily stated reason I'm rejecting the guy. A good amount of the time, we're just not clicking and I'm just not into him. That can depend on a huge number of factors, including personalities just not being compatible.

Maybe if there's something universally unappealing about him that he could potentially work on, and he seems receptive to hearing what that is at that moment (which most men in this situation are not), then it'd be better to tell him.

I think the problem lies in the fact that my face has crappy texture from having very naturally dry skin/genetics and I have tiny wrinkles because of that, so the foundation was still clinging to those problems even with moisturizer and primer.

It doesn't help that the word itself has fem in it, leading some to forget it's about equal rights, not female worship. 

I honestly think the term needs to be retired and replaced with something that screams equal rights, which is really the whole point anyhow. 

Either that, or I'm as misled as other men about what feminism is. *shrug*

The_White_Baron,cheatatmathhomework,1389321293.0,"First take the derivative

f'(x) = 3x^(2) + 2ax + b

Find the roots (after simplifying)

x = -a/3 +/- sqrt(a^(2) - 3b)/3

Since 3b &gt; a^(2), you have complex roots. This tells us that our polynomial is *never* zero. So if we can show it's increasing on *one* point, we've shown it's increasing on *all* points. Why? Because if it were decreasing on some point, and increasing on another, it would have to cross the y axis at least once, and that would imply we have a real root, which we don't. This argument relies on the function being continuous, which it is.

Well, the easiest point to take is x = 0.

f'(0) = b. Since 3b &gt; a^(2), and a^(2) is always at least zero, we know b is a positive number. Therefore we found one point where f'(x) &gt; 0, and hence is increasing. So it must be increasing on the *entire* interval."

keypuncher,politics,1389321750.0,"&gt; US does not have debt problem. Never had. Just unfortunate string of very irresponsible tax breaks and inexcusable wars mixed with few financial meltdowns caused by idiotic attempts at deregulation. 

The last time the US paid down the Federal debt was 57 years ago, in 1957.  At the time, the top tax rate was 91%, where it continued to be for the next 7 years... and yet we never paid down the debt again.

When taxes were cut, revenues went UP - so the tax breaks were not the problem.

Military spending in 1957 was 63% of the Federal budget, and yet we still somehow managed to spend 6% of revenues to pay down the debt, and not run a deficit.

Military spending in 2013 was 24% of the Federal budget, and tax revenues, adjusted for inflation and population, have nearly doubled since 1957 - so we should be swimming in money.

The problem is that spending, adjusted for inflation and population, has more than tripled in the intervening time - and because spending has risen faster than revenues, the excess has accumulated as debt.

The reason the debt matters is that we have to pay interest on it - and while the interest rate is currently at historically (and artificially) low levels, that will not and cannot last.  When the interest rate goes back up to the historical average, we're going to get stuck with $trillion/year interest payments.

That's why we have a debt problem."

I know that hockey players have to score with contact  but they also are wearing much more protective equipment.  Basketball can't really be played with large pads and helmets so taking hard shot/falls onto a hard surface is dangerous for player longevity.  Especially when you have players jumping into the air. Imagine if you could simply hit a player, who's essentially defensiveless, when he's driving to the hoop and jumping.

Ashprism,TrueAskReddit,1389322497.0,"They're levels put in place that students are supposed to achieve. We have the program partly in place at my school.

Everyone hates it. We have pre-tests in each class, wherein we waste time and fill in the answer forms incorrectly as a form of protesting the idocy. It doesn't count for a grade, but it's supposedly a marker for where we are as we start out. This happens in every. class. Including gym/physical education. 

We then have periodic tests throughout the year- midterms I believe, which once more don't count for a grade. No one tries on those either. 

And then there are the required finals. Every teacher in every class is required to give a final, no matter what they think about it. And it counts for some percentage of your final grade- I believe it's around 10 in our district. They're giving these tests to all of the grades, and there have been tales of the younger kids panicking and vomiting all over the tests.

The teachers hate it because they're forced to teach to a test they haven't created with a curriculum they don't care to use, all after wasting class time to administer a test they don't care for. Students hate it because the teachers do, and we don't care to take more tests. It's especially bad for any AP/IB students- on top of those tests we then have to handle some bullshit test from the state. And we cannot opt out without our grades being damaged. 

TL;DR- Way too much testing that no one tries for or enjoys renders any and all statistics the administration may collect completely useless. Common Core is silly. "

RUistheshit,magicTCG,1389322793.0,"First off, I'd add more dual lands, up it to at least 23-24 because your deck is so creature heavy. Mistcutter Hydra and Skylasher can help you in matchups against Blue. For control, i'm assuming your opponents could use RWU(America) and BWU(Esper). Their mana base can be shaky at times, so I think Burning Earth could help you greatly there. You don't have too many dual land so the burning earth wouldn't do too much harm- i guess it depends how much mana you have on the field and when you choose to play burning earth. 

Destructive Revelry can help in America control and destroy their D-Sphere's and Bident of Thassa.  I'd definitely put in Mizzium Mortars for creature heavy decks/hexproof assuming you can cast the overload cost.  I'd replace savageborn hydra with Polukranos, world eater because you can take out pesky creatures your opponent controls depending upon the size. 

I'd add more dual lands, maybe some elvish mystics so you can ramp early, use nykthos, and cast a hydra or ember swallower to cripple your opponent mana wise.  Wasteland Viper and Sylvan Primordial could help you out too (I'd sideboard them). 

Overall for control matchups, you could halt the opponent with Burning earth, ramp early and pressure them with early creatures like cackler, emissary. Cast bigger creatures early due to nykthos and overwhelm them. I'd consider adding Nylea, God of the Hunt and maybe Nylea's Bow to give your attacking creatures deathtouch. Slylvan Primordial and arbor colossus can help against neightviel specters or cloudfin raptors. So cut down the forest and mountains, add more nykthos, temple of abandon/stomp ground. Ramp up more, maybe replace a couple tuskers with elvish mystics. Take out the fanatic for nylea/polukranos. I'd suggest at least 2 copies of Polukranos if possible. Add in 1 more domri and 1 more xenagos to help with ramp. Add some mizzium mortars, destructive revelry and burning earth, sideboard mistcutter/polukranos depending on the matchup. "

techlos,dogecoindev,1389323348.0,"wow, such generous!

So far, on paper it looks good. One issue i can think of however is the repeated hashing of the dogepile; i'm not too familiar with the scrypt algorithm, but it may be possible to 'spoof' an input, by finding a collision with the dogepile hash in the new block, and getting your collision validated before the real hash is validated. It won't allow double spending or creating coins out of nowhere, but it may be possible to hijack a transaction into your own account. Of course, this depends on the collision rate of scrypt, as well as sheer luck - it's unlikely to be a practical attack, without having a majority of hashing power. And let's face it, if you had a majority of hashing power, you're more likely to do a 51% attack.

I'll dig into the scrypt algo more later, and report back as i learn more."
fruitjerky,BabyBumps,1389323366.0,"I dealt with this, though I only birthed one instead of two. Don't be scared of the c-section; the recovery time is longer than for vaginal, but just take all the pills they'll give you and you'll do fine. Ask a lot of questions about what will happen to the babies right when they're born--they warned me that mine might have to be whisked off real fast, but she was doing okay so they let me hold her before she went. She did need to go to the NICU and get hooked up to a CPAP though, so I didn't get to have her with me in recovery. If the twins are looking fine, they should be able to bring them to recovery--I've even heard of women being able to do skin-to-skin right there in the operating room while getting sewn up!  
  
If they do have to go to the NICU, pound it into your husband's head that he needs to text you like literally every 30 seconds. I admit I was pretty lonely in the recovery room and it took me awhile to get an update from my husband.  
  
Also be sure anyone who's in the waiting room knows your rules about the NICU, about pictures, and about social media. The large group that showed up to the hospital (quite a few I didn't even know were there) followed my daughter right into the NICU, took pictures, posted pictures of her being hooked up to machines on Facebook... Ugh. And then they felt bad when we told them to stop that and take the pictures down, which I don't blame them for because they were just excited, but, still... Ugh."

Well, I doubt this will change your mind, but it is significantly more annoying on a motorcycle.

Here's what you do in traffic when you're...

**... in a car with automatic transmission:**  
1. You press the brake to stop(right foot)  
2. You press the gas to go(right foot)

**... in a car with manual transmission:**  
1. You press the brake and clutch to stop(both feet)  
2. You release the brake and ease up on the clutch to go(both feet)

**... on a motorcycle:**
1. Squeeze the clutch(left hand) and front brake(right hand), while stepping on the back brake lever,(right foot) to stop  
2. Ease up on the brakes(right hand, right foot) while putting a foot(or both feet) out to balance while waiting to go  
3. When you finally have room to move, you ease up on the clutch,(left hand) while balancing, bringing up your feet once you have enough forward momentum...

Essentially, in a car, you remain in the same position on your seat at all times.  On a motorcycle, you have to do different things with all four limbs, so stopping and going requires a *lot* more movement.

Like I said, I doubt I'm going to change your mind, but hopefully now you know."

SilentLettersSuck,fitnesscirclejerk,1389323762.0,With the amount of gear people wear to spar in the first place there is no room to bitch about getting hit in the head. Important to train to take a hit just as much as we're training to give them.

If it makes you feel any better, my dad isn't talking to me because of Facebook. Well, it's because he posted that homosexuality is mental disorder and I told him ""You're full of dookie"" and apparently that was a *grave* offense. I like Facebook most of the time, but I wish I could just ban certain people from using it. Using Facebook as a soapbox for your bigotry? Banned. Using Facebook to find reasons to be a judgey bitch? Banned!"
