Pipstydoo,changemyview,1390411073.0,"It isn't made for musically illiterate people.

It's made for mass reproduction and profit.  ""Blah blah blah corporate music blah blah,"" you might think.

Look at it from their perspective though.  How do you increase your profit in an industry ""threatened"" by file sharing, and how do you make faster money?

Well, you strip musicians of all creative control so you can both anticipate, plan, and speed up the pace of production.  You simplify the musical composition for the same reason.  Once you've reduced these things to a simple, easily modded format, all you need are ""artists"" to market your product.

They don't have to be talented ""artists.""  Sure, talent makes pitching these ""artists"" to the public much easier to do, but you can simulate talent in production anyway so what does it matter?  All you need is ""the look"" and you're on your way to sales figures.  Just lock them into an incredibly prohibitive contract and loan them a massive amount of money for their ""chance"" at the ""big break"" and you've got a peon class of ""artists"" and a massive ROI.

Not only are you going to milk them for at least three albums, but they'll be paying you back the studio loan plus interest *and* you can charge the ""consumer"" as much as you want while stifling dissent against manufactured music through a false controversy like, say, ""piracy.""  You can marginalize counter-culture musicians by either co-opting them into the mainstream or making it impossible for them to distribute their music on wider platforms.

To top it all off, you can market clothes, shoes, jewelry, cars, and many other products through your ""artist.""  And because your musical formula is so simple you can license your music to other organizations engaged in the very same behavior.  Like a clothing store, or a car company.

And, over time people start to grow up with your music and they don't even realize they're listening to something which has been scientifically synthesized and precisely simplified so that the listener can always be directly marketed.  Suddenly, it seems, your 4-year-old niece knows all the words to ""Roar.""

This music doesn't cause the ""consumer"" to question or wonder or even think.  It's always there as background noise or at the club or in the mall or on your radio.  It's always there so that future listeners will never think it otherwise.  Not because it's the ""best"" music, but because it's the cheapest to make and the easiest to sell.

Someone like you, who was probably born in the 80's and grew up in the 90's and lived part of his or her life without the internet and the smart phone and 36 televisions in your restraurant, wonders what *in the fuck* is wrong with music today and why do so many people like it?  And the answer is, you were born and grew up when the transformation I described above was taking place.

Make no mistake though.  This kind of music the only stuff out there, but I bet you've never had to work so hard to find the alternatives."

piggybankcowboy,nursing,1390411272.0,"Hi there. Non-nurse, here. Long story as to why I've been in this sub for so long, but the short of it is I really respect what you folks do. Anyway, I'm curious as to your thoughts on my opinion, since it is something that has deeply concerned me for awhile.

I'm not sure Dr. Oz is entirely to blame, though he is, no doubt, a shitbag for taking advantage of the situation. I think a good portion of the blame lies with our cultural attitudes and education here in the US. 

We want quick fixes, and we want free advice from authority, no matter how much we try to deny it. I have my own hypothesis about where this ""convenience demand"" came from, but we won't get into that now. Couple that with the apparent demand for golden calves, or this idea that there must be a people's champion to fight against ""big bad science."" 

I think this is happening for multiple reasons, one being a lack of scientific education with a focus on the philosophy of science (essentially why it does what it does). Medicine is, of course, a science, but we've got half the people believing that science means ""infallible"" and the other half denying science as an arbitrary authority just trying to sell us something. With some very loud voices shouting from both ends, it's arguably difficult for many to decide who to believe. 

Look at it from the perspective of the type of person mentioned in the top comment; the stay at home moms. The TV is likely going to be on quite a bit, and if you've watched any daytime television in the US, you know that you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a prescription drug commercial. So they see the ads, and hear that dreaded laundry list of possible side-effects without understand that is a legal caveat that *must* be disclosed or where those statistics came from. It is all taken in at face value, and has even become the punchline at times with the attitude of ""look at these doctors, giving out drugs that just make us sicker!"" 

More rational people know that those potential side-effects generally only happen with a small percentage of the population, and that since each human body is not an exact replica of the next, there are bound to be some variances with *any* consumed substance, including pharmaceuticals. We also understand the other caveat that the commercial is indeed trying to sell something, but that should never override the judgement of a medical professional that knows your patient history. This is all largely lost on a disturbing amount of people in our society. 

And people like Oz only make it worse. Now we have these forced authority figures freely dispensing medical information to a population that not only doesn't understand where the information is coming from, but that Oz is not their personal physician, knows nothing about their patient history, and is basing most of his claims off assumption. They also don't understand that this isn't how science works, and that science should constantly doubt itself until verifiable results are accepted among peers, and at *that* point, substance X can now be called ""medicine."" 

Oz got famous by taking advantage of the ignorance of his followers, but as Obi Wan says, ""who's more foolish? The fool, or the fool that follows him?"" I'm of the mindset to blame the population more for not taking the time to educate themselves with resources at their disposal. We're interacting right now on what is possibly the greatest tool mankind has ever known; the Internet. 

That doesn't mean jump on and consult Dr Google, either. That means learn how to discern productive information from misinformation or just plain falsehoods, which is another area where a disturbing portion of our population fails. Many people have trouble discerning fact from opinion. For example, the book I just wrote is largely my opinion based on empirical evidence that I have noticed...that does not make any of what I just said fact, but simply my take on what might be going on for the sake of discussing what I perceive to be a problem in our society. Many people also have trouble sorting verified information from misinformation, and don't realize the many ways that language can be manipulated to *sound* like truth, when in reality either nothing is said, or a falsehood is delivered as trusted fact. Again, it brings us back to the problem of who to believe, but now there's an added twist; taking an hour of one's time to sift through public information and cross check these claims made by TV doctors or other self-proclaimed health analysts is, by one excuse or another, too much to ask. 

I think you all likely see what I'm getting at, by now. I'm presenting this because I want to know your opinions on the matter as medical professionals, given that you deal directly with this attitude that ""somehow science is bad"" yet the same people seem to be yelling ""fix it! fix it! fix it!"" when something goes wrong.

Lionflower13,yoga,1390411567.0,"I don't know why this post is being downvoted. I think you ask relevant questions.

I would recommend taking a class at a yoga studio for at least 8 weeks so you can learn proper form. Practice what you learn on your own daily. If you like the interaction, you can keep up the class or you can continue your practice at home, at the park, where ever you like.

Yes, it is normal to be unstable and shaky at first. As your form improves and your core muscles get stronger, you will shake less. If you practice every day, you will notice BIG improvement in about a week.

You may be getting a headache because you are pushing yourself too far too fast. Listen to your body. If you need to take a little break in the middle of class, assume Child Pose and catch your breath. This is perfectly acceptable to do for anyone who is feeling strained. Try to hydrate well before class (and make a trip to the bathroom before class starts - hee hee). But, I suspect that you may be over doing it a little.

Remember, yoga is about improving your body gently over time. Don't try to keep up with the people around you. Modify the pose if you need to so that you get its benefit without hurting yourself. Your instructor can show you modifications to do.

Whether what Dolph said here had anything to do with his de-push, no one outside of the company can know for sure (though I tend to think that it didn't, but it didn't help him either). 

As for those who think that he is being punished for this, and that the company doesn't understand how to work the internet and the sheets in a ""Kayfabe 2.0"" way, let's for argument's sake say that you're right and he has been punished for this...the next question is why? Is it because he talked shit about Orton? I doubt it. Or is it because he wasn't penciled in for a feud with Orton any time soon, and his off the cuff worked-shoot could have taken the focus off of the Orton-Bryan-Authority storyarc and cost them money? That's far more likely. 

TL;DR - If this is true, Dolph isn't being punished for what he said, but for trying to get himself over at the expense of an invested storyarc that was in its infancy."

ballookey,exjw,1390411931.0,"My advice to just about everyone, regardless of whether they're a JW, exJW, or never been one, is to de-prioritize the relationship search. There are safe ways for you to get out into the real world and meet people.

Not necessarily for relationships, but just to get to know people, to get used to the social adjustment of relating to ""worldly"" people. 

Eventually, as you work on yourself, you might find someone. And if you don't, the online dating sites will still be there for you when it is 100% safe for you to be present on them.

Think about your interests and see if there are ways for you to socialize within them. For example, I attend a monthly Women's Beer Forum, I go to classes to learn about crafting techniques like mold-making, I go to game night with friends, etc…

It's a slow process, building a social network outside the JW's, and right at the very start is probably not the best time to be pursuing a long-term relationship."

Now, people who are in that ""negative"" class usually use those words with one another, and it's cool, because it's coming from a place of social equals, and not the historically oppressive class. This is why women can call each other bitches, gays can call one another fags, and blacks can call one another niggers. 

Being a dick? [Little digging](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2030/what-came-first-dick-or-dick) into it's etymology points to the idea that it might be short for dickhead. Or that it might be a riding crop. Or that you're acting like that asshole Richard. No one seems to know. 

A woman calling a man a dick has the same sting as a black person calling a white person a cracker: about none. There's no historic context of oppression behind it.

Myuym,AskMen,1390412357.0,"&gt;A lot of guys (at least in my area) describe themselves as average and normal. To me this equates to boring and dull, wouldn't you want to be perceived as above average and super cool?

Average and normal doesn't mean boring and dull, it means they are seeing themselves as mainstream. Not a weird subculture. No weird quirks. You shouldn't see average as a grade, where they should try their best to be beyond the gray masses. you should see it as: ""there is nothing wrong with us"". 

&gt;Guys who have on their profile that they are interested in long term dating (if we assume these ones are not just looking for hook ups) just write messages with ""hey"" or ""how are you doing tonight?"" Why would they expect that girls would respond? I have absolutely nothing to say to such messages, it is just so boring!

We don't expect girls to respond, we expect them to maybe look at our profile and then decide if we look good enough. Would you type a very long (personal) introduction if they would just ignore it. Also when you get an message back from the other party that might indicate an interest, it is a change in the positions of power. If you are writing very long introductions then it could look desperate, So if you essentially start of uninterested with a ""hey"" message, then wait for those that reply, then they are kinda initiating the conversation, because the ""hey"" that is sent to 1000 girls isn't really the start. Makes you seem less desperate. 

&gt;Some tell really weird, not funny or offensive jokes in the first messages. While humour is subjective, I am talking about the ones that very few people would find funny let alone understand. (I just had one go on a tirade that dinosaurs didn't exist, that Satan put the fossils there to test our faith etc, only to turn around and say it was all a joke and that religion was dumb). It makes me think they are unintelligent, mean, rude or just really strange.

Women like to laugh. those who sent the messages are probably thinking they are hilarious. So they think ""Women like to laugh"" + ""I'm hilarious"" I got this cat in the bag.  

&gt;A lot of the pictures I see make no sense to me at all. Some guys just make no effort what so ever: obviously dirty clothes, bad lighting, blurry web cam etc. While others are downright terrifying like photo shopping the picture to look like a zombie. Why would they not want to put their best face forward so to speak?

So if I would take myself as example. I don't have a real camera. 2.0 megapix on my phone where every picture looks bad and a webcam that's build into my laptop. My possibilities for taking pictures are limited so to say. Now If I would want a picture to use somewhere I would need to use my laptop. Laptops can be moved, but I'm not gonna go around with my laptop in hand to look for the best lighting. And as a lack of camera's might have indicated I'm a complete newbie on the whole photo's thing, so I wouldn't even know what good or bad lighting is. Also If I had a blurry webcam I wouldn't know how to unblurry it.  


&gt;Then there are the seemingly never ending pictures of cars. Of all the women I have ever met, sure a few care that a guy drives a nice car, but I think only one I know of actually cares what kind of car it is. Why do guys think posting pictures of their car (sometimes that will be the only pictures they have, and it's not even a nice car so it doesn't seem like they are pandering to the superficial crowd) is something that will interest most women?

I actually don't go to datingsites, but a car can be used to measure the success and wealth of a person. And success and wealth certainly do interest women (and men too I think) especially if it's ""not done""to say pick me, I'm rich and make X dollars a year. Also wealth and success is relative. if you are really poor an ugly car might still seem good, because ugly car is better than no car. 

&gt;And finally, the pictures with other women. Are they trying to look cool and prove they are desirable to women or invoke some sense of jealousy in me? It makes me feel like they think I am too stupid to notice this attempt at manipulation.



&gt;&gt;Some men skip from relationship to relationship, never once staying single, because they always have a girl waiting in the wings. We tend to hate these guys, but it might be our fault they exist. Social psychologists at Oklahoma State University published a report in the current issue of Journal of Experimental Social Psychology on “mate poaching.” Participants in their study were shown the same picture of a moderately attractive male or female, depending on their gender, and some were told the person was in a relationship. Then, participants indicated how interested they’d be in pursuing a relationship with the person in the photo.The study found that single women were more interested in the guy when they were told he was already in a relationship. In fact, 90 percent of the women were interested in him when told he was taken, compared to 59 percent when told he was single. Men didn’t show any preference for the women as related to their relationship status, and neither did women in relationships.
“This finding indicates that single women are considerably more interested in pursuing a man who is less available to them,” reports Dr. Burkley. “This may be because a man who is attached has already shown his ability to commit and, in a sense, has been pre-screened by another woman.” Unconsciously, we’re screwing ourselves. By finding guys who are able to commit more appealing, we’re overlooking the ones who are available. Brains are useless when it comes to matters of the heart. [source](http://www.thefrisky.com/2009-08-12/mate-poaching-single-girls-are-more-interested-in-taken-men)

So the photo's with women is more a ""look I can have normal relationships with women and I even got through the pre-screening from one, I'm a safe pick""  "

For years and years I have been telling those poor nerds who say: ""Boba Fett totally survived!!!! Maul got robot legs!!!!

Even stuff like The Force Unleashed has nothing to do with the films.

So great, you had your fun with the books, but Abrams and Kennedy owe the fan-fiction universe less consideration then a comic book movie owes the source material (and we all know how loosely adapted those are). 

EDIT: Didn't expect anyone to read this, but here is the official story on what is canon in Star Wars: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Expanded_Universe#Official_levels_of_canon

As you can see Abrams can do anything that doesn’t contradict the very top level of canon. Also it is up to Kennedy and Disney what is canon now. ""The Lucas top level of canon"" was over the day he sold Star Wars. And before that Lucas himself was free to contradict anything (even change the original films). So my point stands that Star Wars canon has always been tier-based. Even the films themselves haven't been safe from changes and contradictions. "

Jacksambuck,SubredditDrama,1390413256.0,"&gt;Internalized sexism in men tends to manifest itself as gender policing.

I'm not asking for ""gender policing"", I'm asking for ""internalized sexism"" in men. It's important that it is those exact words, since my argument relied on the fact that only in women is sexism ""internalized"", ie men are the source of it, while women are vessels. 

I'm sure you and other feminists can bullshit for hours on all sort of made-up terms. So your books are irrelevant to the matter at hand. So is that Justin Bieber piece, no mention of internalized sexism. Please, keep your eye on the ball.


&gt;Then there is internalized heterosexism and homophobia

Not the same thing. This concerns gay men specifically, an oppressed group. Only because they are gay are they allowed the ""internalized"" qualifier. 

&gt;You claimed here[3] that most feminists think women can do know wrong

It is apparent to anyone outside of the feminist bubble. Let me just list some facts. 

Feminists

- believe that women cannot be sexists towards men

- believe that women who are prejudiced are merely channeling male influence

- named their movement after women, and oppressive gender roles after men(patriarchy)

- have always blamed men historically (look up the declaration of sentiments)

ulvok_coven,AskHistorians,1390413345.0,"First of all, you're referencing the Manifesto, which shows your knowledge of the topic is *extremely* limited. The Manifesto is a polemic and not a philosophical work. Not only have Marxist thinkers repeatedly brought up problematic aspects of the Manifesto, *Marx himself* criticizes his earlier thought in *Grundrisse,* which was the extensive outline of his thought which was incomplete as of his death. I suggest *Capitol,* which is usually the main reference for communist thought, and clearly outlines his definition of capitalism *and* its relationship to feudalism, which is the case being discussed.

&gt; You see, I said what I did because you acted arrogantly and rudely towards what I thought was a well-constructed, informative post by a flair-holder (who put in their time to earn that)

I'm hardly arrogant or rude for calling out someone who is wrong. His flair isn't in communism, and being a flaired user doesn't make you a magic expert on everything. They are not gods, they are people who are well-studied in particular topics and have a cursory knowledge of many other things.

I have a much deeper knowledge of communism than many people, but my knowledge of the transition from feudalism is limited. I came to this thread seeing if I could get a good critique, and what I get is people taking a Roman historian at his word when his basic understanding of the topic is *flat wrong.* In the interest of facts and spurring the analysis I would really like to see, I have to criticize analyses which are incorrect.

ToastyXD,AskReddit,1390413395.0,"I think it's hard because as we grow up we learn that friendships are more than that casual drink with friends and that it's something that needs time and emotionally invested. 

Look at the friends you have from your grade school days and who are still a major part of your life. How much do you care for them? Friendship gets harder as we start to learn that we can't accept things for face value and we are less trusting as we get older. There are also less opportunities to meet and hang with someone as we are all focused with our job, our home life, and our financial problems. 

A friendship isn't something that's easy. It's something that can spontaneously, but it can also dissipate without warning. There are good friends and bad friends, there are the ones you'd save from a speeding train and ones you hope end up working in McDonald's forever; whatever the case, a friendship needs you to be invested and to be active in keeping it, if it is worth keeping.

I can without a doubt say, my best friend of my life, Timothy, will be my best man at my wedding. He's been there for me when I was down and when I was up. I was there when he was down and when he was up. Sometimes I was a total dick and I need to make up for those times, but it's amazing because what is an amazing friendship all sparked from me joining an out of school choir and cozying up to one of the most intimidating guys ever. He's helping me get in shape, he congratulates me on my longest relationship, and he puts up with my idiocy. I love him and I wouldn't give him up for the world. 

Friendship: it's a beautiful thing that needs you to be fully invested. If you aren't, sometimes you lose someone and you don't know how much they meant till they're gone. "

In fact, perhaps you can start with couples' therapy, because this is clearly effecting you both, and it may be helpful for her to know she isn't walking into it alone."

BelleLune,beyondthebump,1390413675.0,"Sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's not. My children are ~5 years apart. Before I had children, I didn't want them to be that far apart. My sister and I are 5 years apart and I always felt resentful towards her, in a way. When I was pregnant, my energy level was very low, so I often felt bad that I couldn't play with my son as much as he wanted. But it helped him learn that he's not the center of the universe. And hubby helped ""make up for it"" in a lot of ways. Throughout my pregnancy, my son was so excited. He told everyone that he was going to be a big brother and that mommy had a baby in her belly. I was worried that he'd change his mind once the baby was actually here. When my daughter was born, he couldn't get enough of her. He loved her so incredibly much (and there is just nothing sweeter than watching your children fall in love with each other). She is 5 months old now and, already, they just have such a great bond with each other. She's been smiling for a while now, but she only laughs at him, nothing else. She in content just sitting in her walker/bouncy seat/swing and watching him play. He constantly wants to ""play"" with his baby sister and snuggle with her. If she's being particularly fussy and me or my husband seem to be getting frustrated with her, he always stops us and says ""it's okay, she's just a baby, maybe she wants me to play with her!"". He takes care of her as best as he can and I've never felt like either one of them was neglected for attention. 

Now the age difference would be very different for you, but people do it all the time, so it can't turn out too bad, right? lol.

And a cute sibling story just for good measure:
My daughter has been nursing like crazy lately (teething and/or growth spurt, I think). One day, she was taking forever to nurse and just playing around with it, so I said ""okay, I'm cutting you off now"". My son had been sitting nearby playing and gets extremely angry, stands up with his fist cocked back like he's going to punch me and screams ""NOOOOO!!!!!!"". So I look at him and say ""whoa! What are you doing??"" and he says (completely serious and very angry) ""YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CUT MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!"". So I had to explain what ""cut you off"" means, but he was indeed ready to try to hurt me to protect his little sister. And my god, it was adorable."

biffysmalls,lifehacks,1390413893.0,"- If you work in an office environment, there will printers and thus paper. Those paper boxes are a perfect size for moving most things. While this may not be able to help OP right now because of their short notice, if you know you're going to be moving even three months ahead of time, that's enough time to stockpile a few boxes a day.

- If you're on a tighter schedule like OP, while liquor store boxes are pretty clean, they're also pretty small in most cases. What I used to do is go into Staples, specially the Copy Centre and ask for all the boxes they could spare. The staff there will gladly give them to you (unless one of them is moving too) because a box they can giveaway, is a box they don't have to breakdown for the compactor.

- Using newsprint to protect your breakables isn't a bad idea, but I submit that for a few pennies more, you're better off with dollar store paper towel because you won't have to rewash the ink off of your glassware plates, etc

- U-Haul is cheap, but they are cheap because they do not maintain their vehicles, and any ""damage"" (read: being the unlucky bastard who rented it when it finally broke down or the engine caught fire, and yes, this happened to me in university) is the renter's responsibility. Assuming it's an in-city move, rent a panel van for a day or two and resign yourself to multiple trips if you can't afford movers. 

- For tangling jewelry and the like, again, the dollar store is your friend. Simply pick up a little kit that's designed for kid's crafting and art supplies, put each piece in individually in the tiny boxes and then tape them shut.

- Label all of your boxes with at least the room that the contents belong in. If you can, also a list of its contents. Be more specific than ""Stuff that goes on shelves"". I love my wife, I really do.

- Take apart your bed(s) the night before the move. Sleep on the bare mattress or an inflatable one for that last night.

- The entire week before the move, resign yourself to take-out, microwaved meals or pre-made frozen stuff you pop in the oven, and use (as environmentally friendly as you care to) disposable cutlery, cups and plates. Packing up ones kitchen takes a lot more time than you realize. Factor in that money into your moving costs.

- Buy a rolling wardrobe closet that will fit all of your hanged garments (preferably one with a zipped cover. This may seem like a luxury, but if you only have one moving day and it's in the middle of the week and you have to be at work the following day, it will come in handy. You will also inevitably use it again for your next move or future garage sale.

- If possible, use the day before your move to clean your new home. Nobody cleans their old place to their own standards.

Another way is to clear the wave quickly and then roam into the enemy jungle around the 7:00 or 12:00 mark.  There's a good chance you can either win a skirmish over their bottom side buff or you can pull the enemy ADC away from the lane to defend while the wave dies to the tower.  You can also do this with dragon if you know their jungle or mid laner is away from the bottom half of the map and/or they lack vision over the dragon pit.

To do the second one even more effectively you can do a mini-slow-push.  Start with the lane pushed to just in front of your tower around 6:00, then kill the enemy caster creeps quickly while just last hitting the melee ones.  Two waves later you should have an enormous creep wave built up provided you can zone them from being able to thin the wave, just in time for you and your support to either make a play inside the enemy jungle or call your mid and jungle to make a play for dragon.

Be careful not to get baited into a fight inside the enormous creep wave if you try to build one up to hit the tower.  It's easy to underestimate creep damage.  If you're going to fight, make sure you do it far enough away from the wave on either side to avoid making creep damage a factor."

DangerAndAdrenaline,KerbalSpaceProgram,1390414164.0,"&gt;How do you get the intersect distance that close? When I get into orbit, I'm using a maneuver node to try to get them closer, but I can't seem to get them to line up, while still maintaining orbit.

Get one portion of your orbit touching the target orbit. So that you have intersect points (even if they are far apart).

Time-warp through a few orbits until they are kind of close-ish.

Fiddle with the maneuver nodes until they are reasonably close. 

Start doing steps 1 &amp; 2 in the chart.


&gt;Similar to 1, if I'm burning retrograde to decrease the difference between my speed and the target speed, I end up killing my orbit, and being drawn back towards the Mun surface. If I burn towards my target, I push my orbit into a really lopsided shape, which messes up my intersect points...

Stop worrying about your orbit once you are close enough to do steps 1 &amp; 2 in the chart.

1. Kill relative velocity.
2. Burn towards target.
3. Wait until you stop getting closer and go back to step 1.

Everytime you finish step 1, your orbits should be a little closer to matching."

If I wanted to walk around, they encouraged it, but they didn't force anything on me. Once active labor hit, I just wanted to lean over the bed and wiggle my butt, they were cool with that. 

I don't know what type of pain you are having, but it might be sciatica? I have problems with my left hip due to my scoliosis and after walking sometimes, it'll swell and feel like a shooting nerve-type pain down my leg (which is what I hear sciatica feels like??).

Nope, you're going in the direct opposite direction of the person who'll say ""each and every gay is a walking mincing caricature"".

I attended a pride parade once back in 2006, and that was once too many times-- claiming that there aren't a dearth of people encapsulating every negative stereotype-- ones that do nothing for the gay movement in general, except set it back, especially in the eyes of everyone but the extremely socially liberal, is to be untruthful about the event in general. Might as well have Zippers put up on a bunch of floats and paraded down the street.

&gt; try to paint the whole thing as some evil movement by homosexuals to get your children and shove their genitals in everyone's face. 

Well Gay Pride and the militant LGBT movement in general doesn't really help dispel any of that sort of thinking, does it?

Not in the slightest.

&gt; and yes, someone representing our country is outspoken in calling a segment of our society ""unnatural"", that is going to cause people to ""flip out"" and rightfully so. 

Right, *that's* the issue here, on this trip. *That's* the problem that's being created with Harper's delegation that claims to represent all levels of the Canadian population /s/.

Give me a call when this guy starts bulldozing the gaybourhood and beats the snot out of anyone who doesn't like it (or kills them), and Harper stands by and says he ""refuses to condemn it publically"".

Until then, I'm going to play it safe and concern myself with the real problems this Harper delegation cause and their lies about ""Harper and the Conservatives are representatives of Canadian opinion. We are best friends with Israel and stand by everything it does""."

When I was about 5-7 I went to a nature camp that did a basic after school program in a cabin in the woods with 6 kids. When I was about 7-10 I went to the after school program that rented out a church hall with about 40 kids. Once I hit 11 my mom wasn't working anymore so I would just walk home the 1/2 mile and stay there. 

This probably isnt as common in the US because it is really expensive but most 2 working families probably send their young kids to an after school program until they are old enough or they have an older retired relative pick up their kids.

(the reason he builds Wit's End is more for the on-hit applications during his ult than the AS, in case you were wondering).

I'd personally recommend a very tanky build with a lot of CDR.  Warwick is basically his ult + his W in teamfighting so you want to maximize the uptime on those abilities.

For runes, I prefer flat AD reds, armor yellows, flat MR blues, and your choice of quints between armor, AD, MS and Hybrid Penetration.  The flat AD is very important unless you start Doran's Blade or something, since WW tends to get pushed into his tower and needs the help last hitting so as to not need to spam Q to avoid missing CS."

In a good RPG you should feel like you're a part of the world. You should be surrounded with characters that feel very real and personal.

ulvok_coven,AskHistorians,1390415875.0,"[This article:](http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050425fa_fact4) 

&gt;  Worse, from a strategic point of view, Mustasim had recently angered the Shiites by various insults and offenses, such as throwing the poem of a famous Shiite poet in the river. Now vengeful Shiites volunteered help to the Mongols in Mosul and other places along their march. The caliph’s vizier, or chief minister, was himself a Shiite of uncertain loyalty. Islamic opinion afterward held that the vizier, al-Alkamzi, vilely betrayed the caliph and conspired with the Mongols; an exhortation in Muslim school books used to say, “Let him be cursed of God who curses not al-Alkamzi.” As fighting began, Hulagu, acknowledging the importance of Shiite support, prudently posted guard detachments of a hundred Mongol horsemen at the most sacred Shiite shrines in Najef and Karbala.

I'm doing some searches on JSTOR but I can't find any primary sources in translation to back it up. Someone who knows the histories a little better could do a better job finding one.

I know al-Alkamzi is given various motives for his advice - which was *not* to raise a huge army to try to to defend the city, nor to negotiate with Hulagu (who it should be mentioned was riding with a truly massive army, not just an ordinary Mongol blitzkrieg) - and he's particularly vilified.

That being said, recruiting locals was a favorite Mongol tactic. Hulagu had previously offered the standard Mongol peace - pay taxes or die horribly - and the caliph hadn't even deigned to discuss terms with him, instead threatening and dismissing the most powerful military commander on the planet.

I don't remember the Secret History mentioning these Shi'a, which isn't surprising. However, I find it unlikely that this split was wholly sectarian - given the disinterest of the Empire in Islam, or really any of the religious groups they conquered. I would not be remotely surprised if these joiners were really a varied group of local recruits that were used by Sunnis to vilify Shi'a, particularly because references to Alkamzi often have anti-Shi'a subtexts. The Mongols are extremely hated in period Muslim texts, partly because of their brutality, but more because they were infidels who represented an existential crisis for Islam, which was conceptualized as spreading until it was the only religion on Earth."

She lacks a gap closer or a reliable escape prior to 6.

Her W (shroud) is her method of disengage while she waits for cooldowns.  You cannot trade vs her if you sit in the shroud letting her get another use of her abilities.  

Her ""combo"" post-6 is to hit you with a Q, then wait for 5 seconds for the Q ability to be available again while the first Q's mark on you hasn't yet worn off.  Then she R's to you, procs the Q, then Q's and procs it again for an enormous burst of damage.  Solution is to either be tanky enough not to care about her burst or to avoid getting close to her while you are marked.

The easiest way to kill an Akali is to bait an all-in and then have a pink ward or an upgraded sweeping lens ready to drop once she uses her shroud.  Since she has no reliable escapes apart from her W or R-ing to a nearby creep, you can often secure a kill by baiting her engages with your jungler nearby.

Otherwise, build MR if you want to continue to lane vs her past 6, or just clear the wave and roam or kill jungle camps if you don't want to build MR.  If you don't build MR, you cannot fight her."

eighthgear,anime,1390415970.0,"Time for more relaxation! Watching Inari, Konkon Koi Iroha is almost nostalgic, in a way. It reminds me of a lot of older shōjo series.

Anyways, as I expected, the anime has skipped quite a big part of chapter 2 and 3 from the manga: [](/s ""the part wherein Inari, in the form of Sumizome, confesses and then ""de-confesses"" to Tanbabashi."") I mean, that would have likely been in last week's episode anyways, but I was wondering if they were going to somehow wedge that in this week. Ultimately, though, I have no problem with that being cut - it really wasn't vital to the story. I'm glad that the manager reveal occurred this episode (as it should), which clears up any worries about a love triangle.

Inari as Hashimo was certainly as hilarious as it was in the manga. I thought that the whole ""test"" scene was a bit of a stretch, but it was accurate to the source material. I guess I find it weird that Amaterasu would be so callous, putting a bystander in harm, but I guess we have to assume that Amaterasu can't actually see everything and didn't know that was going on. 

As a whole, it was an enjoyable episode, and I am certainly looking forward to the fun things that are to come.

biffysmalls,Frugal,1390416484.0,"The breasts - eat one now and save the other for a sandwich or stirfry.

The bones - for making sandwiches or stock for soup where you add the shredded thighs and dark meat.

The drippings, gizzard and other guts - As you slow roast your chicken, make sure you pull out the gizzard and plop it into a pot with water on the simmer burner. As your chicken slow roasts, so too will the gizzard slow cook in the water. When the chicken is done, remove it to cool and seal its juices. Now take those drippings at the bottom of the pan and (either in a clean pot or same pan over two burners if your oven ware can take direct contact heat) add some flour and make a quick roux. It should look like paste. Then, slowly add water, a bit at a time, constantly stirring. Salt an pepper to taste, and take a stick mixer on low speed to it if you want to. By the time the chicken has cooled enough to carve, you have an awesome gravy for your chicken breast and potatoes (if you made them on the side) and extra for any sandwiches you can make from the rest.

Easy stock recipe: Buy two cheese cloths as it makes it easier. In the first cheesecloth, put in all of your bones, a child-sized handful of coarse sea salt and another similar amount of whole peppercorns. Tie it off with either silicone or traditional cloth ties. In the other cheesecloth, add one coarsely chopped carrot, two coarsely chopped celery stalks, half an onion and whatever fresh or dried herbs you prefer (I prefer rosemary and thyme) and tie this one up. Dump them in a pot of water, where the water comes to just about the level of the cheesecloth packs, and set to boil. Allow to boil for about 15 minutes, then lower the temperature. Cook for at least three hours. You can now simply remove your cheesecloth packs and without changing puts or straining, can add your ingredients for whatever soup you want to make, or freeze it as-is."

Renner1,CanadaPolitics,1390416516.0,"&gt; Not unlike the evangelical Mormons that haunt my bus stops and ring my front door every Saturday; on Sundays and at the Sky Train stops it's the Jehovah's Witnesses. I'm not about to engage in a campaign to halt their activities. I support their freedoms of expression, speech and association.

Why, though?

There are normal Mormons-- normal in the sense that they're not extremely enthusiastically evangelical and their lives and everything in them come first before trying to convert people to Mormonism or whatever.

Jokes about Jehovah's witnesses aside, I'm sure there has to be normal people who are Jehovah's witnesses somewhere.

I'm not advocating that the militant LGBTs should be shut down-- I'm just saying that they do that broader movement as a whole absolutely no favours. Aggressive, petulant, hypersexual caricatures running around and creating a ""popular gay culture"" and a ""gay image"" that absolutely do nothing to expend the gay rights movement or get them where they want to go in terms of greater societal acceptance, in any way.

&gt; On the other hand, I would question the merit of bringing an outspoken social advocate of any sort on an official delegation to another state; unless, of course, a purpose of that delegation was to engage in related social advocacy.

He's brought basically a pack of pro-Likud, anti-Palestinian Rabbis with him. The pastor is just also rabidly pro-Israel-- his delegation is certainly intended to send a message or set a tone."

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1390416640.0,"First off, French is particular in this case. I've done some research on French relationships with Great Lakes Indians, and while in translation the nearest word is 'nation,' it's not the same as nation in the modern English sense. It's probably closer to 'the crown' or 'the kingdom' or 'the empire,' but with some emphasis on the peculiar concept of France - a righteous Catholic Empire ruled by the king. It doesn't refer to *the French,* but instead, the French lands, or French government and their nominal holdings. The 'nation' of France *did not* exclude Indians, for example, and included them by default - it excluded Protestants, however. Brits, who later controlled the area and dealt with those Indians, *excluded* them from their conception of being British and British-Canadian, and made them an Indian out-group.

There is a historical conception of 'nation' but it's dissimilar from the modern one, which is why I hesitate to advocate its use. For example, Rome had a concept of Romans and not-Romans which was related to the extent of its territory, and not racial concerns - just like the French example. The same was true of the Holy Roman Empire, who considered it Rome's successor. The Mongol Empire was actually very much the opposite - the Mongols are steppe nomads, and all the rest of you are just client-states (which, towards the end, excluded their leaders, who were criticized for being culturally too Chinese). And, modern usage of 'French' - and Roman, and Persian - now have an emphasis on the history and cultural lineage instead of who-owns-what and the legitimacy thereof."

Every single good and bad thing that happens to you is no longer yours, it's for both of you to deal with together. 

That's all the married stuff, the serious things like bills, your house, children, etc, It's the stuff you'll deal with with your Wife/Husband and the things you'll argue over, but that's only a small amount of the time you'll spend together. 

The rest of your time is going to be spent with one another and if you aren't best friends, things aren't going to be easy. You *need* to have shared hobbies, need to like some of the same things, enjoy spending time together, are happy for each other to spend time doing their own thing... Exactly the same way you feel about your current best friend; you share some things, and don't others, but love being in each other's company. 

Except for my Daughter, my wife is the only person I spend every single day with, we've lived together for 18 months, married for 6, and is the only person I feel strange about not seeing for an entire day. If we didn't have shared interests, and if she didn't let me enjoy the ones she doesn't, the relationship wouldn't work. 

The other piece of advice we both think is brilliant, given to us by her Grandma was ""You don't always have to like each other"", and it's very true. We can argue like FUCK about the most petty things and can get quite pissed off with each other... but that's fine and you should expect that with someone you spend every day with, it's just a stupid argument.

If this is a pattern and not just an occasional foot in mouth misstep, the onus is on you to stop being a jerk. Think about what you say before you say it. It's difficult to make this a habit when you're used to blurting out everything you think, but it's important so you don't hurt anybody. Before you say something, think ""What if somebody said this about me?"" If you would be hurt by it, don't say it.

Second, educate yourself. I spend a lot of time reading about things that don't affect me. I identify as bisexual, but I've never had to face any issues that come along with not being straight. So I spend a lot of time lurking in LGBT corners of the internet, just reading what people have to say. Sometimes it challenges my worldview enough that I get angry, but then I realize maybe they have a point. (Not always, there are LGBT assholes too.) More recently I've been delving into the T area of LGBT. It's included in the acronym but hardly anybody talks about trans issues. By just listening to what people have to say, I've been making myself more empathetic towards what they deal with. 

Perhaps you need to do some listening of your own. Think about what other people have to deal with. I think once you understand people more, you'll naturally start being nicer."

She's not rejected you, she's still your friend. She's just turned you down for a date. She's probably sitting at home thinking *wtf, have I been girlfriendzoned here? Has this dude only been nice to be for the last 5 months so he could get into my knickers? Was our whole friendship a lie? How am I going to get over this?*

It sucks to be in the girlfriendzone, the more it happens the less you trust men. Seriously, it's shit.

Secondly, she's turned you down because she doesn't fancy you. She said it was because you didn't smoke because she didn't want to hurt your feelings, it was probably the first thing that popped into he head. 


So, then, OP- what to do? 

You need to remove this girl from your girlfriendzone. Let that shit go. Stay stoic. You can control how you feel, but you cannot control how she feels. Every time you catch yourself thinking about her, imagine her scratching her arse and sniffing her fingers, or picking her nose and eating the boogers- whatever it takes. For the love of God, **do not start smoking to impress her**. 

Romantic rejection sucks, bro, but it's not about you, it's about her- so there's nothing you can do.

Now's the time for a little self improvement. Stop using the term 'friendzone', when women hear it we translate as ""immature neckbeard with misplaced sense of entitlement"" - it's not attractive. Dealing with any kind of rejection is a challenge, and challenges are what make us tough.

I don't really recommend to come, nor to NOT come. Brazil isn't that mess as it looks, it's just ""regular""; I've been in ~15 countries, lived a couple of years abroad - I have some knowledge on it, but by far not an expert.

Things will be overpriced and stuff, but currency exchange will help a lot. BRL is on a quite low price (about 2.4 per USD), and I don't think it'll change much. Stadiums might be OK AND SAFE. Tickets aren't for anyone, plus it'll certainly have a huuuuuge security around. I wouldn't be surprise if they even use the Army on it. Get around might be a pain, but it's likely to be doable. I suppose it wasn't much different in South Africa 2010. Food, Stay, ... it'll be pricey but most of people that already paid thousands of dollars to get into the country wouldn't mind about pay 15$ on a meal.

Another thing, it'll be during a dry season (winter). In some cities, like Rio, they're facing some heavy rains by now. Like flooding and shit. But it won't happen during the World Cup...

I'm not saying that you should come, nor that you shouldn't. This is a huge country, we have very decent things, and shit-hole level things. But it's likely that you can sort it out.

BelleLune,Parenting,1390417406.0,"1) How seriously important is it to wait until we are ""ready"" in various ways; financially, physically/emotionally/mentally/relationship, etc. I've heard no one can ever be ""ready"" for kids--but I don't believe it's that black-and-white. Or is it?

I truly think you can never be ""ready"" for kids, but you can be prepared. I think it depends on what type of life you want for your children. I got pregnant when I was 17, so I was kind of thrown into it. But I now have 2 children (5 year old boy, and 5 month old girl) and I am only 23. We don't own a house, and I really wish we did, because I'd love to have a home for my children to grow up in and feel a connection with. Emotionally/mentally I guess depends on you. Children are exhausting; physically, emotionally, mentally. If you're feeling like you're going to miss out on all these wordly experiences already, then you may resent them for missing all that. I never felt that, I always just wanted children. Relationship-wise, you both need to be on the same page. Having kids will probably not help your relationship in any way, so if you guys are having issues together, kids will probably just amplify it. And you'll both need each other for love and support through the entire journey. So you both need to figure out what you want, together.

2) Any experience having kids when one person isn't thrilled about it or is questioning? Is waiting to see if things change a good idea or no?

When I got pregnant, when I was 17, baby daddy wanted me to get an abortion. He felt that he wasn't ready for kids, that WE weren't ready for kids. We were young, high school drop-outs. But I chose to keep the baby and he supported me in my decision. He was always ""there"" for me, but I could feel his disappointment in the situation and it made it hard. Once our son was born, his attitude changed a lot. That was his son, he loved him.

3) Are kids really, truly worth it? Regrets? (sorry to ask, but I'm learning)

I sure think so. They are a lot of work, but that's what makes it so rewarding. There are times where you just want to scream and rip your hair off, but there are other times where you'll never feel happier. Watching my son learn to talk or walk or ride his bike. Or recently, he's started to learn to read and write. It's magical, it really is. You view the world in a whole new way and really appreciate the wonder and magic that's all around you.

4) Any other insights you could share into the life of parenting or figuring out when or if to have kids?

I feel like it would be easier to be more established in life, to have a career and house and car and not worry so much about finances. I currently work full-time, while going to school part-time, and my husband works part-time during the hours I don't work. All to make ends meet. I wish we could spend more time together and didn't have to worry so much about bills. Regardless, it's all worth it when I see my children smile. And regarding pregnancy, labor, delivery and post-partum for your wife, I feel like being so young helped a great deal. I had smooth-sailing pregnancies, short and easy labors, quick and uncomplicated deliveries, and recovered pretty quickly afterwards. I hear it just gets harder the older you get."

Next week, increase X by 2 or 3, whatever seems reasonable to you (and builds up to a number that coincides with your test date - if you can knock out 18 for multiple times a day on March 10, you'll be able to hit 23x1 on March 12).

I mean for BC its a 4.5 billion dollar cash crop that isn't realized in tax revenue. If there was a 20% sales tax and a 20% export tariff on BC Bud that would be huge for provincial budgets and would make BC a much stronger province to compete against Alberta and Ontario as leaders in Canada.

&gt; Half the reason they called it was Rex told the refs before the game that your team tends to do that and they should watch out for it. I'm not saying BB was purposely breaking the rules but Rex noticed this in tape and took advantage, which is just good coaching

Sure, it's good coaching.  But the Pats still lost the chance to kick a fieldgoal because a penalty that wasn't otherwise applied was applied once, regardless of why it was called.  The whole point of refs is having consistent application of rules, and that rule was not called in other games."

Renner1,arabs,1390417997.0,"The ""Muslim Brotherhood"" killed the process but the revolution is not dead.

Send Morsi to tear out Zawahiri's throat with his teeth if the Muslim Brotherhood wants to gain any sort of credibility and tell the most urbane, technocratic members that they ought to repudiate any and all relationships with the assuredly takfirist, sectarian, or extremely conservative Islamist. 

Tell them that they're obligated to help the authorities destroy the Salafi Jihadis/Takfiris in the so-called ""Sinai Insurgency"", and that if they want to participate in any political process, they have to present the police and the army with trophies taken from dead takfirists they killed personally. Doesn't matter what the trophy is-- clothing, takfirist standards, testicles-- any sort of proof.

They should also endorse the idea that any sort of ultra-conservative influence, like the niqab, isn't actually a part of anything and that if the ultra-conservative wants to wear the niqab, then she has to accept that a headscarf or no particular cultural-religious garment at all are sufficient in the eyes of plenty of other people in the country."

The Star Wars universe is very large and I would like to see a story set there but, separate from the 'big story' of the original series. That story has been told. That they've started building a full scale Millennium Falcon indicates that they're going the other way. Rather than create new icons or have some fun and adventure in a well realized fantasy world they'll waste their time making stories that are too closely associated with the ones we already know and it'll feel borrowed.  
  
That's my fear. By putting a new story set near the main characters or events of the old movies when they can't ultimately contradict or undo their conclusive nature takes all the risk, danger and tension out of it. That's why I'd go with all new characters. Tougher sell, for sure but more rewarding if you pull it off."

MasterDignam,Fitness,1390418166.0,"I'm in a similar boat - had an ACL reconstructed in the past and the knee's not really the same - just as strong as the other one but just doesn't feel the same, and acts up when I sit to long or mess up on technique during the squat. Also recently suffered a shoulder injury - partially torn labrum, although definitely not bad enough to require surgery as of now. 

I wish you the best of luck on the MRI results (man those F'ers are loud) but if your cuff is totally torn then I would really consider surgery. There is some amount of strengthening you can do to get around in day to day life, but at 29 you're really limiting yourself down the line. Pressing things overhead will be damn near impossible from what I understand, leisure sports are mostly out of the question, and some activities just impossible.

I too take doctors advice with a grain of salt, but I also can imagine what life would be life without an ACL - sure, the muscles would compensate and I'd be able to get along mostly fine, but I wouldn't be able to now go snowboarding, play pickup basketball, do power cleans, etc. I thought about not getting shoulder surgery if I had a SLAP tear and not just a small anterior tear, but ultimately I would have done it. Rehab fucking sucks and a repaired joint is never 100%, but I think it's worth it. It's up to you, though - it sounds like you're able to do mostly what you want to do. I just didn't want to have to worry about a hard fall on the slopes knocking my shoulder out for months and setting back progress in an instant."

happycowsmmmcheese,funny,1390418200.0,"It's women (or girls, rather) like this that make responsible young mothers feel like they should be ashamed of their age.  I'm 26 years old, and my daughter is 8.  Feel free to do that math, I'll wait…  I was WAY too young, but I pulled my life together on my own, and I did what needed to be done to make sure that I could raise my daughter right.  Give her things that children need.  Not just material things, but the emotional stability that is important for all children.  And yet, even though I have one of *the most* intelligent, kind, and happy children ever to exist, I still feel shame, even now, about being so young.  The worst part of my day is often picking my daughter up from school when I have to stand by the door waiting with the other moms, all nearly old enough to be my own mother, and I always know that they look at me and think I must have been some cliche teen mom… But I wasn't.  My daughter was my priority from day one.  Did I have to give up on my ""teenage dreams?""  Sure!  But who doesn't?  Maybe I let them go a little sooner than most people, but honestly, those dreams were always just dreams and whether or not I'd had my child, those dreams would have still eventually died.  But, who cares?!  I have new dreams! Better, more realistic dreams!  Goals that I can actually accomplish!  And maybe being a young mother put me on the path to a more realistic future sooner than other people my age… maybe it gave me a head start in some way…  

But, I'm not saying I think teens should go all willy nilly having babies because I happened to be good at it!  Oh heck no!  I know I'm one in a million.  Most women who have children at the age I was at have to rely on their own parents for years.  I didn't, but I struggle.  Raising a child is the hardest thing you can ever do.  What I really wish is that women like this ""teen mom"" would just NOT even try.  If you aren't ready to be a mom, DON'T!  If it weren't for moms like her, then maybe moms like me wouldn't be judged instantly on age alone, but rather the quality of care we offer our wonderful children. 

On a side note, I did in fact consider abortion.  I'm a fairly intelligent woman, I think, and there was quite a bit of inner struggle when I discovered I was pregnant at 17.  In truth, my decision to have my daughter was based on my feelings about where my life would go and how I felt I could handle the challenges to come.  I contemplated these challenges for hours and days and weeks before I decided what to do.  Several years after my daughter was born I found that I have a genetic hormonal disorder, which generally begins to cause problems in women's 20's, only to continue to get worse over time.  What that means for me is that I have less and less estrogen in my body as I get older.  As of right now, my estrogen is low enough that I no longer have ""regular"" cycles.  This also means that I may be infertile, or will soon become infertile, and will probably go through menopause much sooner than most women, perhaps as early as my mid to late 30's.  If I had decided not to have my daughter, I may have never had another chance.  Somewhere inside me I have to wonder if the choice I made to have a child at 17 was a choice influenced by the incredibly fast ticking of my biological clock.  At 17 I was hormonally equivalent to a woman in her late 30's/early 40's, in the sense that my body had only about as much time to reproduce before natural aging would make it much more difficult…. Perhaps some natural force inside me knew this and influenced my thought process in deciding what to do. "

I don't think that the word is inherently insulting, however, and most people tend to use it as a compliment. Still, lots of people don't appreciate people commenting on their bodies/looks, period. Some people are also more insecure than others and will feel more affected by these comments. It sounds like maybe your friend is just a bit sensitive to the issue, OP, since you said that she has a hard time putting on weight. 

I have to say that I don't think that it's on the same level as fat-shaming, however. Yeah, it hurts to be insulted no matter what, but thinness is still the societal ideal, whereas fatness is absolutely vilified. Fat people are regularly openly mocked and dehumanized. It kind of bugs me when people equate the two. I don't appreciate body-shaming of any kind, but I don't think that the two examples are perfectly comparable. It also sounds like your friend is a bit hypocritical in expecting people to be sensitive about her body while she has seemingly no respect for overweight people.

Batman accepts, because dealing with stressful situations in an emotionally healthy way has always been a trademark of Batman.

saikron,truegaming,1390418651.0,"In UO there were special people, like server celebrities. Since fast travel was so limited and there were player shops and housing, most of the game kept you in contact with people that frequented your ""neighborhood"" - so even if people weren't famous UO-wide or even server wide, people would recognize each others names and clothes and remember the adventures they had together.

When I moved over to EQ I was turned off by the fact that everything happens in the chat box and despite there being a lot more people playing, I never just bumped into people or made friends because they had already figured out where they were going to meet people in the chat box and there was no reason to speak with the randoms on the way.

Jevia,RandomActsofMakeup,1390418874.0,"- Aquaphor!

- No distinctive smell or taste.

- Nope, it's not tinted. It's colorless and absolutely clear.

- I use it about once a day, mostly before bed.

- I don't believe it has any SPF. I live in cloudy/cold Michigan so I don't spend much time outdoors or in the sun, so SPF for my lips isn't a priority for me. Someone say in California though would maybe have to pass up because of this.

- I prefer lipbalms without taste, and I've tried quite a few because I'm addicted. I have Eos, Chapstick, BabyLips, Vaseline Lip Therapy, Aquaphor and Aquaphor lip at my disposal right now. The Eos mostly goes unused because of the strong taste. Chapstick use to be my favorite but I started having serious addiction-like habits with it, where I felt like I'd go nuts whenever I didn't have it on and I'd panic if I didn't have one on me when I left the house. I quit Chapstick and started on Aquaphor; fresh hydrated lips without having an itch to constantly reach for it or have it on me at all times. :) It's not as thick as the Vaseline therapy so it feels light and good on your lips, it applies smoother since it's a thinner formula than all the others, and it works so well as keeping my lips hydrated (a big problem I have). I absolutely love it.

- It doesn't come in a cute container. :c I love cute containers... And I believe it only comes clear/colorless so there's a tiny letdown that you can't get in sheer tints."

They also just seem so hypocritical complaining about jargon... There's jargon for *every* field. There are specific vocabularies, terms, theories, etc. within *every single field*! Why target the social sciences?

And of course they just can't resist getting a little potshot in toward girls/women (and their sexuality).

MasterDignam,Fitness,1390418948.0,"As an anecdotal counter - I gained significant muscle (or at least appeared to, as I lost fat an increased in size) during a month of completely ketogenic eating (basically no carbs or under 5g a day, just the trace amounts found in meat and a little in heavy cream and some cheese). I had no health problems, no lack of energy, and increased gains in the gym, and all I was doing for a month was eating fatty meat and drinking water. The reason I ended it was ultimately because I wanted to drink beer and eat cheesecake - though I had no cravings for carbs, I wanted to get wasted with my friends every once in a while, and I love cheesecake.

For me, I believe ketosis and keto-adaptation work well for adding muscle mass and burning fat, but I really don't understand the science behind it. That said, clearly  take what you read about carbs, or anything about nutrition with a grain of salt. Test different things out with YOUR body, and stop trusting that what works for others peoples' (or the averages of other peoples') will work for you."

My best advice is to participate in every activity, therapy group, etc that's offered to you. Some of them will be ridiculous in your situation. For example, art therapy consisted of coloring with deliberately dulled crayons. However, you never know when something helpful to you will pop up.

Best of luck. Please let me know if you need to talk about or have more questions. Yes, I was terrified to go, but it was absolutely where I needed to be at the time."

vorpalblab,AskMen,1390419291.0,"OK I am currently in a LTR with a woman I met online from a dating site (POF) and had a profile on OK Stupid as one o my female friends calls it, and others.

Having looked at thousands of female profiles I tried to not make most of the common turn off mistakes.

I did not look at the guy sites by posing as a female after the first time. The guys were equally clueless.

1 I never look at ads with no pic.

So I had some good candid shots that flatter me a bit, but are honest reflections of what I normally look like. Here is me now, but I ain't shopping, but would use it if I were to go online again.     http://imgur.com/a/Ms3cH

After that I took the time to compose as honest a statement of what I am, what I like to do, the kinds of people I like to associate with.

I also try to define who might interest me, including pointing out that - let me be the judge on beauty - as long as you are reasonably sane and healthy we should be good to go. Minor handicaps included as acceptable as well as children.

I also pointed out that a straightforward 'normal' person might find me a bit too difficult to accept as I am not the usual button down older dude. I don't even own a tie or a TV for instance.

Also I pointed out that I don't have the resources to rescue some penniless woman with six kids, but at the same time I can pay my own way, and if a trip to Inner Mongolia is in their cards - go alone or buy two tickets.

I also promised a reply to anyone who wrote - so why not write if you think you are even close to a fit?

I got between 150 and 200 replies overall. And read with care and attention the same number of profiles not to mention the others I wrote to first.

As for what I became sick of reading repeatedly because it had no relevance was:

cookie cutter statements 

jeans to ball gowns

proudest achievement is my (child)

mostly blank other than the implied statement ""I am female, that should be enough""   nope, not nearly enuff, lazybones

long walks, candle lit dinners, fireside bullshit

knows how treat me like a woman  ($$$$$$$$$?)

I love to travel

Most of this is about consuming a lifestyle sold to them by some social marketing agglomerate.

I wanna know what lights your fire, what have you read? what do you do voluntarily in your own time? What do you wanna do?

If the answer includes TV, movies, bowling, and stuff like that - thanx but no thanks.

PLUS I want a face to face meeting soon (This is what is all about) because writing skill is not the way to judge a social possibility? No pen pals please.

Then suddenly everyone is in a serious relationship so no one invites a few of their friends or that guy/girl they're trying to hook up with (and his/her friends). Instead they just bring their significant other.

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1390419627.0,"&gt; Currently the inflation level is similar in effect to about 5% flat tax on all capital. Making that progressive with other currencies around might just mean that people trade all their excess UBIcoin to gold. You avoid UBI-club inequality, but you don't avoid real life inequality this way.

I wouldn't want UBICoin to acquire it's value from a currency exchange. At least certainly not in the short term. The structure if it at least in the beginning would not be conducive to that type of exchange anyway. Since UBI distributes the reserve currency there's little impulse to acquire through trade. That would come later.

&gt; You could somehow try to stop trading UBIcoin to other currencies. But even if you succeed the fact that you would get 0$ with 1000 UBIcoin would probably mean that UBIcoin would be actually worthless.

All currencies are worthless until they establish an exchange value. There's little to no motivation to buy into a UBICoin until some exchange value is established by the founding individuals. Over time I'd expect people to trade the coins for other forms of currency, but unlike Bitcoin that would not be the primary financial basis. It's not as though currency exchange markets wouldn't take into account the progressive or even transactional wealth tax aspects.

&gt; U.S.S.R. communism was supposed to work on such idealism. And it did for a long time, but it was very inefficient and the result seems inevitable in hindsight. I really appreciate your attitude thought, world would be lot worse without idealism. But idealism is good medicine for change, it does not good fuel for long running schemes.

Your criticism isn't applicable. It's not meant to function on determination of founders in the long term. That's a primer for the system not a long term dependency. Over time the value of the currency would be determined by the exchange value established by trade encouraged by those founders. There's a transition based on use. 

Bitcoin had no different a journey. There was no value in it until people started trading it for currency and services. The big difference is I wouldn't like to see UBICoin structurally dependent on currency exchange value as Bitcoin was.

Honestly, you're worrying about problems years down the line that I've largely considered in the structure of the currency. The immediate hurdles would be creating a currency, verifying individual humans without double dipping and establishing exchange value within the network. Similar hurdles any alternative currency faces. "

Really? I never felt quite this way when playing it. I have no issue with games that let you choose what you become, as those are the best kind of games there are. A game where you are merely guided through a story without being able to make your own choices is dull.

Maybe it just isn't for me in particular, though from the sound of it the game should be exactly what I desire the most. But after I tried it out, I was very disappointed. The problem with M&amp;B is that you don't get to do enough. Like I said, the world feels flat and bleak-- no lore, badly scripted dialogue, flimsy-looking combat etc.

It's not as good as people make it out to be. And to correct you, it isn't exactly open world either. Most of the game is just a map view, no scenery or anything.

I know someone who went to a funeral they protested. My friend didn't even know they were there until afterwards he saw it on the news because they were so far off.

No.  It's the way the bill was passed.

I guess the bill should have foreseen that some wouldn't be able to afford Obamacare.

Instead they are blaming states for not signing up more Medicaid recipients.

If these folks do not sign up for Obamacare... they are violating the law.

In states that have accepted the expanded Medicaid... mass quantities of new people are qualified to get medical insurance at no cost to them.  But it costs the state.  The government is only going to cover the full cost for three years.  Then states are on the hook for 10% of the expanded cost.

Some states are legally required to have balanced budgets and cannot take on that massive new expenditure.

All of this ... the way the law written by Democrats and voted in by them is now being spun as Republicans denying insurance?

Nope.

Every material is going to have different surface properties, and some may need more finishing steps before the item is done.

Obviously those are not all done with the same kind of printer, and they all come with limits on the size of what you can make.  I'm pretty sure the nose cone of a Tesla would be considered a very LARGE item to 3D print.

Even if he did think she was consenting, which I highly doubt, I'm pretty sure his peeing on her and verbally abusing her takes him out of the ""good, law-abiding young man"" category. Regardless of your own thoughts, I don't think you need to be swearing at a victim of abuse."

I was *supposed* to do Gaussian dev for my BSc project this year. I'm writing my own code because developing for Gaussian is horrible and I don't want anything to do with them (and because it's quicker to write my own and I'm short on time, a bit). There are plenty of open source alternatives that are better for most things. I mostly just know these for inorganic problems, though. If I can get funding, I've got a job working for one of them this summer and the systems there would be biological, so I'm assuming that one (being ADF) is actually good for organic systems, too. *And* it has nicer wavefunctions."

I was standing on the side of a bridge looking down, and there were people falling. I told my sister and best friend about it, because I would sometimes be woken up by the dream five or six times every night and it was just so weird and scary. That summer, I went with my family to my grandparent's timeshare in Arkansas. One day, we went to go see a historic swinging bridge that had been around for a really long time. When I went out on the bridge and looked down, it was *exactly* what I saw in my dreams, other than the people falling, of course. I remember there was an empty gallon milk jug, and a blown tire down there. I absolutely flipped out, because I thought that the bridge was going to fall right then. I finally convinced my family to leave, and it was the only time I ever remember being completely hysterical as a child. Nothing happened right then, and they were all kind of laughing and teasing me about it. They were definitely not laughing a few months later when [the bridge fell and killed five people.](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Collapse_of_the_%E2%80%9CSwinging_Bridge,%E2%80%9D_Heber_Springs,_Arkansas) I also had a dream about the 1989 World Series earthquake the night before it happened.

ArnoldChase,tampa,1390422080.0,"Young Tampa Attorney here who has lived in Tampa and St. Pete.

I can tell you that most of my friends who practice in St. Pete also live in St. Pete.  The younger St. Pete attorneys live downtown.  There is a great bar/club/restaurant scene within walking distance.  The older St. Pete attorneys buy houses in North St. Pete.

As for living in Tampa... if you did live here, you would want to live close to South Howard near Platt and Azeele just because that is where most young professionals live.  That gives you quite a commute every morning.  However, there are more professionals in downtown Tampa (vs. St. Pete) and the Hyde Park scene has a lot of young attorneys such as yourself.

I would probably say get an apartment in Downtown St. Pete.  Over the course of your first year here, you will find out if you like St. Pete, or if you find yourself going out in Tampa.  If you like it, buy a condo downtown or a house in North St. Pete.  If you dont like it, look for a place in south tampa.

It seems to be happening. Every day there is a ""Was my account banned?"" thread, so OKC is banning users for some reason. Perhaps if that was clearly enforced in the user agreement, it could help thin the herd of offensive trolls. Conversely, they would likely just continue to create new accounts.

Therapy has taught me to actually do deep breathing. I do it when I'm in a situation where I can't do something else.

Piggybacking on that last point, positive thinking is insanely helpful. I didn't realize how negatively I thought about myself in situations (ex: this class has so many grad students-- I'm going to look so stupid). Instead, I've tried thinking things like, ""let's see how I can learn from them. Or there is always something I can learn from others, regardless of their academic standing.""

Renner1,CanadaPolitics,1390422839.0,"&gt; This may sting a bit but: gay pride is not for you.  We don't care about what you or others think about it

Then why throw a shit-fit if I say I think the excess is nauseating and that I think it's wholly counterproductive to the overall gay societal acceptance movement?

If I'm just one of those nasty oppressor-class heterofascists, then you can just ignore me or something, right? 

&gt; It's not for changing the mind of bigots. It's not to show the world what shining, stand-up citizens LGBT people are.

I wasn't aware it was ""bigoted"" to think someone dancing up on a stage wearing a pair of ass-less chaps or nipple rings is tasteless and pointless and counterproductive? Or that acting like debauched, hyper sexualized cretins in public was a mark of being a shining, stand-up citizen?

 I've worked with people who are gay and lesbian before, and I had zero problems with it. You know why?

Because that wasn't their primary identity, and they didn't spend their time screaming about ""heterosexism"" or destroying gender binary or anything else. They were actually extremely work-oriented people, which was extremely fortunate considering how short handed we were at work at the time.

Didn't even bring it up to me, because it absolutely wasn't an issue for them. They didn't feel the need to go around talking about their sexual preferences or even to go ""by the way, I'm queer"" or anything like that.

&gt;  It is for us. It is for self-expression. It is a celebration of the lives and survival of LGBT individuals.

God forbid that that is the culmination of ""LGBT culture"" or expression because that has about as much value as the worst sorts of tacky, vulgar, openly idiotic things in mainstream ""hetero"" culture.

&gt; I only rarely hear complaints about the sexualization of similar heterosexual events like Caribana or Mardi Gras. I've been to Caribana and Pride in Toronto, and the only public sex acts I saw were at Caribana.

Mardi Gras and Caribana do have more sustenance to them then ""Gay Pride"" does, anyone can argue. At the very least, it's not some petulant, childish, ""fuck you bigots you can't judge me"" that the ""Gay Pride"" so obviously is.

&gt;  Many of the queer community still hold an aggressively militant position. Not so many years ago, ""not in public"" applied to a lot more than dancing in thong, it applied to holding hands, mentioning our lovers and even being out. For many of us, we still sometimes feel like we're in a state of ongoing guerrilla warfare with ""heterosexual mainstream society"", with a ceasefire only recently signed. That kind of energy has a very dramatic release.

Know that I will never, ever side with the militant LGBTs, and I will always talk in the way that I'm talking now. If that's the way that you want to look at it. You're not helping anything-- I suppose you do get a wider range of people to accuse of being ""hateful bigots"" because they aren't on board with the militant LGBT game-plan and this idea that you're at war with ""heterosexual society"".

&gt; The blatant sexuality and over-the-topness is a loud metaphorical ""fuck you!"" to everyone that has ever said ""I don't mind, just not in public"". And again, that expression is for our benefit, we don't really care if bigots hear the message; just saying it is liberating and empowering.

Juvenile, intellectually insipid, and wholly counterproductive to the stated goal of achieving wide-scale acceptable of homosexuality and other ""alternative"" sexual feelings.

IOIM,GirlGamers,1390423483.0,"I found the picture of the man pretty silly and ugly because the picture doesn't highlight what is considered sexy on a man [although this is similar and does](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=54171913).  I mean it's a weird ass pose for a woman too imo, but you see a lot of that, so I tend to think for some reason that is some attraction for whomever likes women.

If they choose a picture of a man in a position that showed off his muscles, [eg this -- NSFW, sorry, picture goes down pretty low, no genitals showing though](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M5eqAauAZdU/UFQ0miMMDkI/AAAAAAAAK8c/y0NHVKuEgRo/s1600/Aaron-OConnell-2.jpg), this would not be a very sexy pose for a woman to pull off because it's angled for a man to be sexy, not a woman.  But a picture [like this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bbCnw55VaBU/Th8eGhynmQI/AAAAAAAAgpE/iPOgGQn1b68/s1600/ChadBuchanan.jpg) could have a man or woman posed, both would be sexy.

What I'm trying to say is, that pose shown wasn't what highlights the sexiness of men.  Search ""sexy male models"" and ""sexy female models"" - the poses are different, because our bodies are different and the opposite (or same) sex is attracted to us based on different things, such as a lot (obviously not all) women liking ripped men while a lot of men (again, not all) like not ripped women."

jewishjihad,Plumbing,1390424045.0,"If somebody else (or multiple somebodies) have their radiators turned off in your building, the steam has to go somewhere.  In other words, you're getting the steam that would have gone to their radiators since steam follows the path of least resistance.  The other possibility is that the main thermostat (I don't think the thermostat in your room is a true thermostat and steam isn't zone-able) is somewhere that doesn't get that warm, thus making the boiler constantly call for heat and you're receiving the brunt of that heat.  Either way, getting that radiator turned off will fix your problem.

FYI, it should take multiple turns (2-4) to turn off the radiator valve.  They're finely threaded and it's not a quarter turn situation.

It's also likely that with the valve turned off, you'll still get some steam since the old steam valves definitely don't seat that well, especially after 80 years of use.  It'll only be enough to heat up the first fin or two of the radiator though... probably just enough to make it comfortable!

If you (or someone else) can't operate the valve or it doesn't seat at all (rare), tell your landlord it's time for a new valve.

Good luck!"

Well, these legal barriers create psychological barriers within which disparities are both less legitimate and more noticeable. So, for an American not to appreciate the disparity between themselves and someone from overseas makes sense somewhat, because by definition the two are operating under different rulesets. But for a rich American not to appreciate between themselves *and another American* seems suspicious. It implies that there are unmentioned barriers between the two and that the ideals of equality and ""oneness"" among Americans is likewise suspicious.

Otherwise, I agree, though. A holistic viewpoint reveals a certain amount of privilege shared by the vast majority of Americans, simply as a result of being American."

Edgar_Allan_Rich,seduction,1390424325.0,"Actually, it doesn't because it's comparing apples to oranges. 

In the Dating Habits article, the girl was already interested due to the initial interaction. If the text interaction portrayed in the article actually happened, the guy would know 4 lines in that the girl was interested. It wouldn't matter what he did or said, she'd say yes to a date and she'd show up. I mean c'mon...that was the longest build to a date I've ever read. She's obviously into it. 

The text interaction from the article is wholly positive when compared to most followup text interactions which are generally haphazard attempts at regaining the girl's attention in order to set up a date. If the girl is giving out ambiguous vibes or seems uninterested during the followup, the tactics from the popular post would  be the better choice as they have a higher chance at being effective.

In case I've not been clear in my point:

The so-called ""trickle"" approach should be taken with a grain of salt because any approach works on a girl who is already interested. To me it reads like banter to be perfectly honest. Why not call her? If the initial in-person interaction had been mediocre, the trickle approach via text probably would have been ineffective. The tactics in the popular post on the other hand would be at least somewhat effective whether she was interested or not because it's *not* banter. 

Both are tools that can be utilized in certain situations, but they should not be compared to one another as black &amp; white contrasting tactics.

Renner1,CanadaPolitics,1390424445.0,"To be honest, the majority of the people in the Middle East couldn't give less of a shit about the war in Afghanistan, especially as far as killing Taliban or Al Qaeda is concerned-- which isn't to say that it's a matter of callousness, just a lot of people either uninterested, or worried about issues in their own countries, especially in those countries where there are cross-boarder AQ splinter groups, or with Zawahiri and the ""Sinai Insurgency"".

What is an issue is the lying and demonizing of people like the Palestinians and the Arab peoples as a whole, as well as the absurd stance that the Harpercons have on Israel and what Israel does.

But the people who'll accuse the Canadians of taking part in the Afghan war ""to murder Afghans and destroy the country"" that live in the Middle East are most often subscribed to some form of conservative or ultra-conservative Islamism and aren't exactly a liked or non-divisive group in the context of their home countries themselves.

Which isn't to say that the Afghan war wasn't handled poorly, or anything like that-- just that ""Afghanistan"" isn't an issue, especially considering Canada and foreign policy, in the Levant or North Africa."

IOIM,GirlGamers,1390424635.0,"&gt; In my experience, these aggressive-type of girls are exceptionally rare, young, and still figuring out who they are. They've never met other women like them, and bought into the belief that we don't exist!

Ex young gamer who hated girls checking in, can confirm this was a huge part of it.  I was at the big-girl age of 12 when I got my 360 and got so wrapped up in the bs that only guys played video games that I was an ass to any girl that was on as well.  Had a lot to do with the fact that every guy was so amazed and interested in me and would give me a shit ton of attention for it, and they would always say things that reinforced my thinking that I was some awesome and unique person.  Thought it all the way up until 14/15 and I realized what an immature brat I was.  

So yeah, it still happens a lot, guys getting so freaked out that girls are playing video games to the point that it can easily sway someone who's young (&gt;15) to believe that they really are something special.  Growing up is a prime time when people start realizing their worth, and it's not like they just suddenly up and believe they're something amazing.

BradPower7,TrueAskReddit,1390424736.0,"I think this has a very simple answer, which is the fact that reddit consists mainly of young Western liberals who have views at odds with the incumbent governments being revolted against. 

The past two or three generations have been the first in the world to have widespread coverage of many revolutions world-wide, and human society as a whole has grown very comfortable with anti-authoritarianism. We see this in the media, which has created a trope of the ""young revolutionaries"" fighting against all odds to change the status quo being maintained by the corrupt old men running the scene. Humans LOVE under-dog stories, probably because it affirms our own beliefs that ""hope is never completely lost!"" or ""never give up!"" etc etc. And really, there is rarely a situation where the ""corrupt old men"" are the ones without the means to defend/take care of themselves.

As a young Western liberal myself, I see videos of these events (such as what is happening in the Ukraine right now) and find it hard NOT to immediately side with the protestors. It doesn't help that reddit is a very circlejerky website, where giving eye-catching, semi-true titles positive rankings takes a person less than a second, placing it higher up so more people can see it. So this combined with our instilled instinct to play social role of the ""revolutionary"" makes it very easy to get behind a movement without thinking about it.

I personally don't try to take sides on this stuff, I try to remind myself the [riot police getting beaten by an angry horde of mob-mentalled protestors](http://youtu.be/dnlbgfFBpoA?t=1m10s) have families and stuff too, and that as biased young foreigners, we don't ACTUALLY know if the government is as bad as they seem. However, that is a very thin line to draw. Are the protestors over-reacting or under-reacting? What other options do they have? Are news sources always accurate? Is it the fault of the riot police for supporting a grimy government? These questions need to be asked more. An angry and armed populace is by no means an under-dog. And then again, neither is a corrupt ruling institution."

1. [Tanya Burr](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrIIH7yHQugaUuoTZDoEUuQ) is my favorite and the first beauty youtuber I followed. She just has the best personality and seems to be so happy! I can watch her videos all day. She is based in England so some items (like Rimmel's Wake Me Up concealer and foundation) can be hard to get for those in the US. Also, she is the soon to be sister-in-law of the sisters behind [Pixiwoo](http://www.youtube.com/user/pixiwoo)(which is great as well) and Real Techniques brushes. Focus on Makeup- Drugstore to Highend.  

2. [gossmakeupartist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA) is another top favorite. He has so many tricks and tips and posts a couple times a week. He is a little festy at times (love it!) and is also based in England. Focus on Makeup- Drugstore to Highend.  

3. [Leighannsays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA) is another great personality. She cracks me up with her mannerisms and quirks. Focus on Makeup- mostly Drugstore to Mid-range, but can dabble in Highend, she also has some hair and nails sprinkled in.  

4. [emilynoel83](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtC8m_F7jX2fGOQ3_nomg4g) (Beauty Broadcast) and [Beauty Broadcast Express](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtC8m_F7jX2fGOQ3_nomg4g) are the same youtuber. The first is more lenghty videos with hauls and tutorials and the second channel is quick 2-5 minute reviews on a certain product which are uploaded Mon-Fri (Friday tends to be her husband reviewing a ""manly"" product). Focus on Makeup- mostly Drugstore to Mid-range sometimes Highend.  

5. [missglamorazzi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5zSySQab9SA6Wz569WDgqw) typically has a good range of beauty items not just makeup. Her ""empties"" videos are probably my favorite ones that she does. Focus on Beauty- Drugstore to Highend. 

6. [Tati](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4qk9TtGhBKCkoWz5qGJcGg) is a new channel to me, but I love her reveiws, tips, and hauls. Focus on Beauty- Drugstore to Highend.  

7. [MakeupbyTiffanyD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrKdCadbo4eN_toHMa4-FSA) can be hit and miss with me. She sometimes can get really long winded about certain things and I have to just stop watching because I can't stand it. Be warned she is a very fortunate lady and talks about things that can make those who are less fortunate cry- lol. Not that she is rubbing it in your face or anything, but just she afford very nice things. Focus on Makeup- Mostly Mid-Range to Highend though not above drugstore on occasion.  "

&gt; This is a silly analogy. Let me be clear: NOTHING WAS BEFORE SOCIETY. There is no such thing as a date prior to society in which humans were humans.

Of course there was a ""before society"".  Whether you believe in Biblical creation or evolution, there was certainly a time when individual humans were alone prior to forming societies - unless you're suggesting that everyone evolved simultaneously on day X.

&gt; Yes, the solution was a compromise on the universal and inalienable natural rights of man.

Because it was necessary, yes.  The Founders were pragmatists.  What good would it have done to refuse to compromise, if the result would be the destruction of the nation and the loss of those rights for any survivors.  They did the best they could in the short term, with the hope of correcting the remainder later.

&gt; Natural rights are nothing resembling universal, and they aren't close to inalienable.

The easiest I think would be a gel pot with a small brush.  I've had the most success creating a smooth eyeliner with this.

Once you've gotten pretty good with that...or if for some reason it doesn't work, I'd try one of the ""felt tip pen"" liners next.  I use the Stila stay all day waterproof one and it has a super fine tip and I'm able to draw the line pretty smoothly.  Again, the primer is definitely helping the liner glide on smooth. 

I don't pull the lid or any skin out...maybe a LITTLE when I'm doing the flick at the end of a cat eye.  But with every stroke...I release the skin back into place to make sure it didn't go anywhere strange...and then pull it back again...and repeat.

I would suggest breaking each of the phases into individual sections, so you can quickly refer to what happens in that phase.


Examples can definitely help. Knowing exactly how graves work to playing cards will make it easier to grasp. From my initial reading, as the game goes on and you acquire more graves, you would need to play cards with a higher burst value in order to get an ally.



Second step should be broken down into each of its individual phases  so they can be quickly referred to for combat.


Where do I put cards that are now allies or graves? To the side? face up or face down? spread out so they can be counted? Is that information secret?




If cards are named, that may be an easier way to identify them as being the same. Two cards are the same if they share the same name.



Otherwise, it seems fairly easy to follow. An example turn, or of a specific event happening might help move along some questions."

superspeck,HomeImprovement,1390426601.0,"A [dado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dado_\(joinery\)) is a cut that goes part of the way through a piece of wood.

However, you have to be careful not to burn the wood when cutting a dado with a router. They make special stackable blades for table saws that you can stack to accurately cut a dado of a specific width in a single pass. 

Dido is completely different, although I do like her music. ;) 

If you look at the back of a very plain square picture frame, you'll find that there's a cut made for the glass, mat, picture, and backer to ride in. Then there are staples or other holding the backer to the frame. That's an example of a dado. Another place that dadoes are used is in joinery; you can do a single dado or a set of dadoes to join two pieces of wood at any angle. "

K2TheM,formula1,1390426618.0,"Interesting. It's hard to make out where the air gets into the system (intake). 

As I said elsewhere the pipe leading away from the turbo looks like the exit side of the compressor leading to a non visible inter-cooler mounted in the left side-pod. It looks like instead of having the MGU-H mounted engine side like on the [Renault](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/19dbp5q7uhgrpjpg/original.jpg) and Ferrari designs, the motor appears to sit in the middle of the turbo. This means that it could be pulling air through a pipe that lays under the airbox along the centerline of the engine. Though without seeing more of the engine I can't know for sure. This could give the engine a bit of an advantage by utilizing a kind of velocity stack (though a very long one...) for the turbo intake. However, I would think this would make for a packaging issue since the fuel tank sits directly in front of the engine, and the intake inlet is almost directly above...

It's interesting that they've opted for a single entry exhaust turbine meaning that gasses from the right bank make an extra bend and are potentially longer than the left bank (though the difference in overall distance is small, and could be ""absorbed"" elsewhere in the manifold)."

I wouldn't say it's to ""benefit"" the men as it is to avoid getting known as that place with just a bunch of guys which would deter guys from going there.

This was long after UO split into two rulesets, one where you were able to take aggressive actions against other players and one where you weren't.

When Garriott made UO his vision was that it would one day be a simulation of living in a medieval fantasy setting.

voxamps2290,AskReddit,1390426729.0,"It starts with the deductible.
 
Kind of odd questions, but important.

Do you plan on getting sick a lot? Have some health issues that requires you to go to the doctor a lot?

Basically, you need to try and predict how often you will use said insurance. If you plan on using it a lot, get a high deductible that covers 100% after that. You may have the high deductible (say 2,500), but every other cost is covered usually 100%. So if you know you will have 50k in medical bills or something, you only end up paying 2,500 out of pocket.

On the flip side with the 50k, let's say you have a low deductible plan, that then covers 80% of expenses (which I have). You would pay the deductible out of pocket (1,250 for example), and then 20% of 48,750, which ends up being 9,750. So you are paying 10k out of pocket on this plan, versus 2,500 on the other.

Learn to try and plan your needs, or at least predict them. You are pretty young (as am I) and can likely get away with a low deductible/low premium coverage because you are (I would assume) healthy."

I watched my mom yo-yo diet for 30 years.  She'd lose all the weight, but within months she'd gain it all back, and then some.  Always.  

Me, I'm fat but healthy (seriously, ask my doctor).  I don't diet, although I am working on making better food choices - not to lose weight, but to be healthy.  I've maintained the same weight for 10 years now (during a time period where most women start gaining if they don't start working out a lot/dieting) and given that I'm healthy with excellent cholesterol and normally functioning everything and no diabetes (type 2 runs in my family) and the fact that the women in my family who I tend to take after also tended towards my size and shape...I've pretty much accepted his is how I'm going to look.

If my health started to suffer, that would be something else entirely, but as long as I can still go on a good hike, work up a sweat in bed, and I don't have any negative outcomes associated with being overweight, I'd rather stick to just trying to eat healthily in a normal way than crash dieting and fuck up my metabolism forever.

And because we don't see men making these decisions in similar numbers, which says to me that there are unequal social pressures coming into play. There may always be unequal social pressures and constrains at play with parenthood - there's no getting around the biology that women gestate and that created unequal needs. But I'm annoyed that women are disproportionately affected in this way, and that the whole debate is framed as an issue women need to address or fix. 

I also think women opting out (whatever the reason - and the reasons may be very good) contributes to the lack of women in leadership positions in various fields. But this is not a problem any one woman can fix.

At a more basic, gut level: Imagine you've got a person who's excellent in their field and enjoys their work. Not a genius, but an individual who brings their own perspective and has worked hard to get where they are. Now imagine this person leaves the field because of family reasons.

notthecolorblue,AskHistorians,1390427227.0,"I see what you're saying, but the difference I would make is this:

If a personal anecdote were quoted in a history book then likely that book would have been reviewed, written, edited, or published by someone knowledgeable in the field, perhaps with a terminal degree. Someone who has devoted their lives to the study of history or whatever the field may be. 

For a personal anecdote written on the reddit we have no processes of verifying it's validity other than upvotes and comments from other random internet people, unless it's from someone that is a flaired user  whose detailed knowledge has been established on a subreddit like this one. If we're going off personal anecdotes we might as well cite wikipedia.

Then again, I come from the school of thought that the most knowledgable and therefore the most valid opinions on subjects are in peer reviewed scholarly journals written by people who have spent some considerable time studying whatever the subject may be, that likely have a masters or a doctorate, so some here might disagree with my take on what constitutes a knowledgable opinion.

I have major anxiety issues, and I found myself starting to act just like you're describing about a year ago, but I didn't peg it as such because it didn't feel like what I thought depression was 'supposed' to feel like.

Depression can be extremely different for different people. Personally, I'm not so much morose as I am just blank and utterly lacking in any motivation whatsoever. Sometimes I will get a wave of it extra hard and will even have trouble getting up from my seat.

I don't really have a good ""reason"" for it either- it's not like somebody died or anything- so I figured that couldn't be what was wrong with me, but as it turns out, depression can be a delayed reaction to a rough patch in your life, which happened to me about a year before I was actually depressed. It's often the case too that you are severely underestimating the impact of a negative event in your life.

Ultimately, the only thing you can do is get a psychologist and consider a psychiatrist to prescribe you medication if that doesn't work. The deal with depression is that it really can knock some shit in your brain out of balance and it can be entirely necessary to need medication to dig yourself out of it."

johnavel,Economics,1390427291.0,"This is a pretty awesome study. I find myself supporting a lot of gentrification projects in Los Angeles, but accepted as a downside that some people will have to move - but that apparently is a misconception:

&gt;Freeman's work found that low-income residents were no more likely to move out of their homes when a neighborhood gentrifies than when it doesn't.

&gt;He says higher costs *can* push out renters, especially those who are elderly, disabled or without rent-stabilized apartments. But he also found that a lot of renters actually stay — especially if new parks, safer streets and better schools are paired with a job opportunity right down the block.

And then more from the second study:

&gt;""We're finding that the financial health of original residents in gentrifying neighborhoods seems to be increasing, as compared to original residents in nongentrifying, low-priced neighborhoods,"" says Daniel Hartley, a research economist.

&gt;He looked at the credit scores of original residents and found that they went up — regardless of whether they rented or owned — compared with residents who stayed in nongentrifying neighborhoods.

JasonWaterfall,funny,1390427311.0,"Well, if there are many different categories and the score in each of them is random, then the average of all those scores will follow a normal distribution ([central limit theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)), meaning that yes, most people's overall score will be close to a certain average value (while there would be outliers of course).
The same is true for only three categories if a person's score on each is caused by many independently random factors, say many different genes in the case of intelligence or looks.

A caveat is that this all really only works if all the factors are independent, i.e. uncorrelated."
eddie8082,ptsd,1390427324.0,"You are most certainly not alone with this. Myself and many of my friends (combat veterans), all had similar issues. I have a hole in my wall, my grandpa (Korean war vet) slept separate from his wife until the day he died, and a number of guys have choked or hit their significant other. Heck, it's like a right of passage for the new guy on CQ to come and wake me up in the barracks to get the shit scared out of him because he doesn't know to wake me up by tapping me on the feet (arm barred the last one, regularly wake up swinging or winding up).

So no, you are most definitely not alone, it's common at least among combat vet, not sure on other causes of PTSD as I have less experience with that. But you definitely have to stop sleeping with any weapons anywhere near you, that goes for heavy objects as well. Trust me, it may be harder, but you will eventually sleep. Separate beds was necessary for me for a while, but I don't need it anymore and my girl still knows not to sneak into bed with me without waking me up first and my dog barks me awake from across the room rather than licks my face. But it's not really an issue for me anymore. Definitely check with your therapist/psychiatrist for options, and especially look at any med changes that may have coincided with their onset. Booze is a bad idea as well. A few of the meds I was on made it more of an issue.

Anyways, good luck. You're certainly not alone. And if it gives you any encouragement, it got better for everyone I know with the issue, to the point where it's mostly not an problem anymore."

There is also the nuva ring which my ex used. You put this in once a month, taking it out for your period. You're also allowed to take it out for a couple hours at a time. If it bothers you / her during sex, you can take it out and put it back in later. I personally never had issues with this, and only ever noticed it when I was fingering her. No issues during intercourse.

Seriously, have a read - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control

rec hlr and hole exhaust--not sure what rec hlr is, hole exhaust is going to be a small exhaust leak and can probably just be welded up.

the wipers can be done by you, or taken to autozone and they can install them for you.  

the tie rod end could be done by you if you have any mechanical knowledge and a halfway decent set of tools, otherwise you're probably looking about $100-150 in labor, plus the cost of the part($50-100).  


front tires, depends on what size wheels you have, but if they're not 17's or 18's they'll be less than $80 a pop for cheapies.  you can also get used tires for $25 a piece or so.  

the exhaust could be expensive, but a muffler shop could have that done for $150 or less. and a weld would be $20 or so."

However, the suggestions OP has proposed are really not practical in OKC for many of the reasons listed by several of the other commenters in the thread.

My counter-proposal is very simple and relies upon the user to take accountability. /u/SavageSquirrel has suggested a more radical approach that women can not receive initial messages at all and would therefore have to be the ones to initiate contact.

No, what I am asking for is to work hand-in-hand with an instructor or divemaster to ""incrementally add experience to my existing training and adding new skills"" just as you said.  And yes, that will eventually include more classes as well.

&gt;A swim-though is all you have the training for - and just barely that. 

Absolutely incorrect.  AOW is all the training you need for swim-throughs, and some operators won't even require that.  PADI wreck certification trains you to enter wrecks, albeit basic training and just the beginning.  Therefore I'm looking for light penetration (yes there is such a thing) in a low-hazard environment that's appropriate for someone with limited wreck experience.  

I'm trying to get more skilled, be a better diver, and do it conservatively where I'm not exceeding my ability level.  I really fail to see where the issue is.  Thankfully I've found an operator who agrees with me, and is eager to work on those skills with me.

As for your inquiry, the scale is somewhat irrelevant, you must remember that if you are putting muscle mass you are bound to gain weight.

As long as youre bulking or defining your muscles, ditch the scale. start measuring yourself and take body fat % into account."
thedictatorscut,AskWomen,1390428350.0,"Of course it's inappropriate and rude, but think about it this way. I'm white. In fact, I'm so white that it's ridiculous. I'm so pale that most makeup companies don't make foundation white enough for me. I can get a sunburn after spending fifteen minutes outside. Lots of colors don't look good on me - I can't wear white or pastels, they make me look sickly, and yellow (which is my favorite color) looks awful against my skintone. I've gotten teased and made fun of all my life, and strangers feel comfortable coming up to me and saying ""Wow, you're *really* pale!"" I've had people compare my skintone to Elmer's glue and mayonnaise, which I find really rude.

And yet despite all of this, I would never say that having people making fun of me for being pale is *as bad as* the prejudice and racism that black people face. The difference lies in that white people - and thin people - are nearly always portrayed as being desirable in mainstream media, and it's not socially acceptable to discriminate against them or make derogatory comments. It's like comparing a paper cut to a broken leg. They're both unpleasant, but one is a lot more so."

saikron,truegaming,1390428359.0,"Yeah, but all of those things worked together to make UO. Most of the mechanics were simple enough that you didn't need to plan much out or give people links to a wiki for you to succeed. And you didn't need an elite team of keyboard warriors, either.

A ""Hail sir! my bro Marcus Da Archer is on his way, but you can stick around and fight some skeletons if you stay cool. don't go past the water or liches lol"" is about all of the tactics you needed, and you could just tell the same thing to whoever shows up even if they have never been to that dungeon before.

LFG tools or channels, trade chat, dungeon chat, etc would have mostly been pointless in UO but are pretty much necessary in later games.

It's the same thing with loot grind + full loot. You can't have both or it would be maddening and always result in bands of OP players getting more OP. Loot grind also redefines the point of crafting in your game. So many of the design choices depend on one another."

Question for you-- if the Palestinians were to give up their right of return-- something that's far more solid and justifiable compared to the grotesque, laughable ""right"" of the American or French or Polish Jews to ""return"" to land that belongs to somebody else-- will Israel end the aforementioned ""right"" of ""return"" for any Jew from anywhere who asks for it? Will they stop teaching in Jewish community centres the world over that their ""right"" to Palestine takes precedence over the rights of Palestinian families that were expelled from Palestine in 1947-49, 1951-55, and 1967, and over the Palestinians who still live in Palestine as well?"

Can I ask where in the world you live?  Getting a slow cooker is the best of all worlds:  massive amounts of food, tasty, *ridiculously* cheap, and easy.  For calories you add beans + meat, then add veggies etc.

If you're in the US, you should be able to buy meat pretty cheaply.  Chicken is the best, and you can get pork shoulders for ~$1.50/lb.  If you're outside the US, I'd suggest making friends with a butcher and asking for the meat that was cut poorly.  It tastes the same and is great for a slow cooker, and they should give it to you pretty cheap.

Has nothing to do with ignition, so you either heard wrong or were misinformed.

&gt;**Evaporative Emission Control System Leak Detected (no purge flow or large leak)**

&gt;**What does that mean?** This indicates a fuel vapor leak or lack of purge flow in the EVAP control system. It means a large leak has been detected. The (EVAP) emission control system prevents the escape of fuel vapors from a vehicle's fuel system. Fuel vapors are routed by hoses to a charcoal canister for storage. Later, when the engine is running a purge control valve opens allowing intake vacuum to siphon the fuel vapors into the engine.

&gt; **Symptoms** You likely won't notice any drivability problems. 

&gt; **Causes** A code p0455 most likely means one or more of the following has happened:

&gt;A loose or improperly affixed gas cap 

&gt;A non-conforming gas cap (i.e. not factory/original brand) 

&gt;Other leak or damaged piece in EVAP system 

&gt;**Possible Solutions**

 &gt;With a p0455, the most common repair is to: Remove and reinstall the gas cap, clear the codes, and drive for a day and see if the codes come back. Otherwise, replace the gas cap, and/or Inspect the EVAP system for cuts/holes in tubes/hoses (you may hear a vacuum noise or smell fuel), repair if necessary

Solor,AskMen,1390428985.0,"Sorry If I came off as a jerk, I think I did. The Pill is pretty noninvasive, but not everyone can take it. My ex loved (still does afaik) the nuva ring. She tried the pill, however it caused her to get sick every time she took it.

She tried a few other methods which I'm not terribly aware of as that was before I met her. She ultimately ended up on the Nuva ring. As for it being 'invasive' I really don't think it is as invasive as you might think it is. She's not a big girl by any means. Only about 5'4"", and weighs maybe 115lbs... not that physical size has anything to do with vagina size in reality. But with that said, she couldn't feel it once it was inside her. It didn't cause problems when she went to the washroom, nor was it a problem during sex for either of us. 

Anyways, as we both know, there is no 1 birth control that works for all women. I understand that someone may not want to get a shot every few months, or have an IUD implanted, but for some it's completely viable and gives them the peace of mind that they don't have to worry about anything for a while.

As for the Depo shots, I have a friend who used the injections for some time, and she was perfectly fine. Ultimately she ended up getting her tubes tied, but the injections seemed to be fine for her.

Best of luck in finding a method works for you, again sorry for coming off like a jerk in my earlier comment. I'm at work, and was just taking a quick break, and somehow I managed to  read your initial comment as someone who was truly uneducated with female birth control."

skgoa,formula1,1390429006.0,"* Sutil: Has massive experience by now and has shown quite some talent. He was pretty much set to replace Massa at Ferrari before he got dropped by Force India due to his legal trouble. (Then Massa proceded to not be fired for 2 more years.) He was brought bach as soon as it became apparent that his trouble wasn't going to be that bad. His aspirations of a top team cockpit probably are a thing of the past now, though he still has lots to offer to any team that needs a reliable non-pay driver. And he has a few personal sponsors.

* Grosjean: Has been brilliant at times, sometimes he managed to beat Kimi on the track. He needed more experience and he needed to get into a less gung-ho state of mind. There is nobody left now who doesn't recognise him as one of the top drivers in F1. He also brings with him $15,000,000 reasons for any team to pick him up.

* Kobayashi: Whenever he had a car under him to do it, he showed incredibly talent. Still he has lots of room to grow, if he gets a couple of more seasons in F1. And he is a fan favorite as well. He brings a small amount of personal sponsorship.

* di Resta: Has shown none of that. He has consequently been beaten by his teammates. He hasn't improved all that much over the seasons he had. Neither the team nor the fans like him, as he (alledgedly) isn't communicating well to his mechanics and definitely comes of as a massive douche in the media. He only got a drive because Norbert Haug liked him and Force India wanted cheaper Mercedes engines. With Haug gone there is no point in keeping him around, as he has almost no other sponsors to speak of.


Other than UK media hyping him up, there really is nothing that speaks for di Resta."

DrPepperHelp,electronic_cigarette,1390429078.0,"I would say use some sort of enamel paint. Maybe do some test runs where you paint a test surface. Let it cure before doing any testing. After the paint is cured (not just dry, but cured) put some drops of various juices on the paint. Let it be for about 48 hours. After the juice has set for 48 hours try applying some heat to it. See if the heat affects it any.

Also before you do any of the painting double check to see if the paints you are using are heat resistant, or toxic in any ways. There will also be the need to rough up the surface you want to paint. If you want a shiny finish then you will need to coat several times then clear coat the paint. So you will need to test each part separately and as a final composite.

Good Luck."

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390429083.0,"That's true too!  In Western culture we often conflate extra weight with laziness or a lack of self-control - two things that are unattractive to most.  And sure, if a person is overweight because they eat junk food obsessively and don't get off the sofa, well that's not attractive.  (Unless you're a feeder fetishist, I guess, like the troll hanging around this post).

People can be attracted to whatever they want, but they often don't bother to push past societally-programmed ideas around overweight=lazy slob to objectively view the person as an individual.  

I actually have a preference for slender men - even more slender than society deems attractive, actually.  That didn't stop me from being in love and lust with a really fat guy for years because we clicked on the other levels.  Preference is just that: a preference.  Most people can be flexible on that if there's something else going on with the attraction.

Speaking in terms of pragmatism-- if they're so adamant that the Palestinians have to give up their right of return, if *you're* so sure yourself-- then what has to happen is the ""right"" of ""return"" for any Jews from anywhere has to be discontinued, full stop.

Yes.

It's wrong of you to *demand* anything of a partner when it involves things being stuck in their body.  Ever.  

But if you're going to be wrong, be upfront about the fact that, and it's up to women to decide if they want to take that risk with you or not.

Let's be honest if you don't have issues you are in the minority.

Now I'm not getting to know just a woman, but getting to know her kid(s) as well as her ex/babby-daddy/hook-up whatever. And I'm down for that but if anything there is not fitting the relationship obviously won't work.

Most of the time you are instantly stepping into a maelstrom of uncertainty, drama, and unclear expectations.

The best thing to do is be blunt and upfront. Don't lie on your profile, and don't make your profile all about your kid, but be upfront about it. Make sure to mention it on the first date.

wafflesquares,AskReddit,1390430044.0,"My own answer: My high school friends and I went out to celebrate the end of the school year, and I told them about the time I was four and ASKED for a surprise party and it all went terribly. So a boy I didn't know too well jokingly suggested that they would throw one for my 17th (my birthday is in July, so about a month after this happened).

Flash forward a couple weeks. I'm at my best friend's house. She goes to a different school, so she knows a couple of my friends. She asked me to look through her Facebook inbox to find something, and I see a group chat, with names of people that my best friend should not know, including the boy who'd said he would plan the party. Based on that and the message preview, I put 2 and 2 together pretty quickly.

My mom was involved too, and I had to act extra clueless when she drove me to a restaurant to ""meet her friend"" and proceeded to delay going inside while my friends set things up. They all totally bought my surprise (though I think I overdid the false ignorance).

To this day, no one knows...except the acquaintance who planned the whole thing, because for unrelated reasons, he is now my boyfriend.

**tl;dr**: acquaintance (future boyfriend) planned party for me, I saw he was fb chatting with my best friend about having a party even though they'd never met, and also I'm a fantastic actress."

GhostsofDogma,needadvice,1390430163.0,"Oh yeah I know how it feels to be a hypochondriac. I swear I went through a period where I went to the doctor once every week or two and visited the school nurse like every other day. I even got an EKG done because I couldn't be convinced otherwise that there wasn't something wrong with my heart.

I had anxiety as serious as you're describing in my senior year though I've improved loads since then. I pretty much hit rock bottom for about 6 months. I have OCD but I didn't know it at the time, and kept getting intrusive thoughts about killing myself. I couldn't figure out why I was having those thoughts if I didn't want to do that, so the only thing I could come up with was that I was either insane or in wicked denial and it could at any moment take over and make me commit suicide. I kinda stopped being able to do anything, really. Could you imagine having that kind of incredible fear for your life on *top* of being a hypochondriac whose own heartbeat scares them? So I did have the stomach thing and everything else. 

The only thing I found that worked for the acid thing was Zantac. Pepto didn't even make a dent. Shitty pills, though. I don't know whose bright fucking idea it was to make a [pointy pill](http://www.commonsensewithmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/zantac.jpg). Since I almost stopped bothering to eat completely at this point, I started living entirely off of Ensure drinks and cheerios. You'll feel shittier without any protein or any solids in your stomach. At a certain point I figured all the acid was killing natural bacteria too and that's why other things got worse too, so I started eating yogurt and that seemed to calm my stomach a bit too. 

In terms of the hard core worrying, you need to take some time to *relax* and clear your head even for a minute when it starts to get out of control. Try googling ""progressive relaxation"". I KNOW it might sound really dumb, but it's a really good way to force yourself to concentrate on your body in a positive way and give yourself a break from the hurricane in your head. It's sort of like a car accelerating out of control; the longer you let it keep going the shittier and more painful it's going to get. It's not going to improve if you don't put the brakes on.

If things REALLY get out of hand and you feel disconnected from real world, do a grounding exercise. The one my psychologist gave me was sitting in a chair, planting your feet on the ground, and then trying to find six objects in the room that are the same color. Again, it might sound dumb, but it puts you back into present time and present place very well.

Lastly, since you have all this time on your hands-- One thing I was doing with my psychologist during the summer when I didn't have school going on and fucking it up was something she calls 'stretching'... Her analogy was that getting back to normal was sort of like learning to do a split. You don't start by slamming yourself to the ground and tearing all the legs in your muscles. You go just a little farther each day, just enough so that for that day you've hit the point where it hurts, and eventually you make it all the way... And you can't stop and take a week off or you'll lose progress. 

That's what you have to do with yourself. You have to do one thing each day that makes you uncomfortable. Anything, even something minuscule. 

Learn to start at step one instead of step five. Don't hurt yourself worrying about the Big things. Worry about hygene. Worry about eating. Worry about sleeping. You have to get all of those kinds of things down before you will be on a foundation stable enough to worry about making it to your dream job."

Just because it doesn't help you get a job doesn't mean that it is worthless as education for education's sake. 

I am also only saying that the degree is less helpful because your competition for most jobs have a better degree than you have just like I don't stand a chance on paper when applying for an electrical engineering job as a computer science major and all the other applicants have electrical engineering degrees and experience. 

You are correct that philosophy majors got employed in a job market desperate for people but they always had a higher level of right out of college unemployment than other majors. The only different you have in a money flooded job market is that more of them get hired. Right now you can get hired as a humanities major but you do that by showing value above ""I have the piece of paper that holds no relevance to the job I am applying for"". You still had to do that in a desperate for worker job market but the criteria was ""oh they might work hard and can learn"" rather than ""they know humanities"". The fact that you know humanities is not the plus that will get you a job so the humanities part could be replaced by anything and that is why it is the worthless in getting employed part."

Getting my hormones was pretty scary at first. However, I went with a letter from my therapist though, so that helped my confidence. Also, my doctor's office (http://lyon-martin.org) is a place exclusively for women and transgender people.

Talking to them wasn't too bad. I explained what I wanted without going into too much detail. I also had some tests before starting. Look for a place that has informed consent if you can, that's what mine is. They will make sure you understand what the hormones will do and then give them to you, barring any medical issues. If the place doesn't do informed consent, I would either go with a therapist's letter of recommendation or just tell them what you want out of hormones and leave gender identity out of it.

Another thing to keep in mind, if one doctor doesn't work out for you it's not the end of the world. You can absolutely go to a different doctor after. You can also order hormones and self med, but I wouldn't recommend that. You wouldn't be getting tested and might not know if something is wrong.

You can do this though. As terrifying as it is, if it's what you what, don't let anything stop you. \^_^"
Zeydon,truegaming,1390430845.0,"If you like unforgiving MMOs, perhaps Mortal Online would be up your alley?

From the steam description:

&gt;Mortal Online is a next generation PC MMORPG both in terms of graphics and gameplay. There are no quests and no safe zones, only an open realistic world where you are free to choose your own path with as few restrictions as possible. Experience true real-time combat where you decide every move your character makes and where your personal skill really matters. Build your own house, shop, or set up a guild to build a keep and both claim and control real territory. With enough power, violence or diplomacy, you and your allies will be able to create and rule an empire. 

&gt;Choose from many different races and professions. You decide your own style of playing and whether to focus on PvP or PvE, both sharing the same game world free of instancing. Devote your life to crafting where there are millions of items to make, combat, magic, thievery, trading and more. Discover new skills, tools and resources. Or, be the first to explore new areas to put your name on the map as new locations are always being added without any announcements, so that explorers can truly be the first to discover them. 

&gt;Mortal Online is played entirely in first-person perspective for unprecedented immersion and is often described as a cross between Elder Scrolls and Ultima Online. "

BelleLune,beyondthebump,1390430868.0,"It definitely has its challenges. I work full-time Monday-Friday 8am-5pm (while pumping milk all throughout the day). Then I come home and nurse the baby, then eat dinner. Then I also take college classes online part-time, so I usually have to do a bit of schoolwork in the evenings (while nursing the baby). Bedtime routine now takes double, if not triple, as long as it did with one child. 6:45pm, we feed baby her oatmeal, then give her a bath, then I nurse her to sleep (she's usually asleep by 8pm) while hubby bathes the older child and gets him in his room for ""quiet time"". When I'm done nursing the baby, then we go say goodnight to the big kid and it's lights out for him. My husband stays home during the week and works part-time on the weekends. Without him, I'd probably lose my sanity. He helps keep the kiddies entertained while I do schoolwork and takes care of the housework so that if and when I do have spare time, I can spend it with the kids and him.

I'd say the worst thing that happens with 2 kids, is when they are both miserable and seeking your attention. Baby will be crying because she's tired and wants to sleep but is fighting it, so I'll take her to the dark bedroom and try to be calming her down. Meanwhile, my 5 year old comes stomping in, crying because he broke a toy and wants me to fix it. And if I tell him I'm busy, que more crying!

But, like I said, there is NOTHING sweeter than seeing your kids happy together. You know those feelings you get as a mom when you see your baby doing something monumental and it's just so magical? It's like that, except you get to watch both of your babies doing stuff together.

The second baby was hard step to make, but it was totally worth it. Am I exhausted? Yes. But we're moms, we figure it out."

DrPepperHelp,electronic_cigarette,1390431006.0,"Every vape shop should have some of each type of Mod and RBAs. In order of simplest to use to most complex to use is as follows.

Batteries:

The Cig-a-like - Joyetech eRoll (This is the only one from this class of vapes that I can even think of recommending) - A must have for those who want to have a small vape and show no interest in anything larger in size.

eGo Style - Joyetech or Vision are the two brands that I would recomend for this category. There are several varity get some of each in each mAh rating (ask me if you want more information on types of eGo styles)

Regulated VV or VW Mods - These are anything from a Vamo to eVic (don't stock any of Joyetechs larger mods they all kinda suck after you get past the eGo styles) to Provaris. Some others are of the box style MVPs or DNA20/30D boxes (some DNA chips do come in tubes such as the Wizard Evolved or the Cyborg).

The Mechanical Mod - These are just battery tubes that look nice, but have no circuitry or voltage regulation. Do not sell these to people who do not know about Ohms Law or how to do some simple math in their head.

The Home Brew Mods - The Duke, Bam Box, or any other device that comes in a Hammond Box of any size. I will also add that this class can be either battery powered or powered from a wall outlet. Don't even bother to sell these until your customer base starts to ask about them or just order them in runs of 5 or so for when customers do have cash ready.

As for topers you want some of each. Cartos, Drippers, Plastic Tanks, Glass Tanks, RBA tanks, and Carto tanks. Maybe even some ""rebuildable cartomisers"".

Most of all just listen to what your customers want, and have some stuff above and beyond what they are currently at. Give them something to look forward to should they decide that they want something with more oomph. "

What you said may be exactly what is confusing me, but I am just having trouble understanding the relationships between the torque forces on 'a' and 'b' in my drawing. I understand this is probably very basic stuff. Just to clarify, according to the AC-43.13 1B Advisory circular, the distance I marked 'X' is the only thing that affects the resulting gauge torque, regardless of any adapters pointing any directions(So in my drawing the x value would just be the length of the wrench). 

Edit: found a way better picture.http://imgur.com/ydS4Spm. (from the website it came from:) ""Notice that if the angle reaches 90°, the effective length of the extension becomes zero and the applied torque is exactly the same as the wrench setting.  It's like not using an extension at all.  This means that if you ever use an extension at 90°, just set the torque wrench to the desired torque and then torque the bolt.""

Here they are saying that for the calculation you only take into account the distance perpendicular to the force applied to the wrench, not at the hypotenuse. But I start running into problems picturing a longer and longer extension. "

2. An adult tells a teenager that he or she 'doesn't know any better', 'doesn't know what they are talking about', or 'isn't old enough to know better' which invalidates the opinion of that person. That person may not have enough experience because of their age, but that is not an excuse for invalidating the way that they feel.

http://andrewwarland.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/the-really-brief-history-of-the-origins-of-the-statute-of-limitations/

Has a long winded write up if you're interested. 

Basically, From 1189 to 1623 in the Common law system statutes of limitations only applied to the fairly complex business of sorting out who owned a piece of property and  money lending (complex in the sense of the literal maintenance of records  was challenging, and possession of private property prior to William the Conqueror and then notably Henry I was rather difficult, given that well, William the Conqueror did basically steal the country and allied nobles were given the  land of non loyal ones and so on). 

After 1623 lots of things came under statutes of limitation, slander being fairly sensibly short in duration.  If being slandered didn't do you any harm  for 2 years or you couldn't prove it within 2 years the courts didn't want to waste time on you.  And there were various limits for various things. 

Obviously the UK has revised their laws numerous times since 1623.   

Civil law has a similar history dating back to roman times.  

(This has nothing to do with the US constitution, it dates at least back to Roman laws, and entered into the US as part of English common law).  "

Once teamfights start Akali is very unlikely to be focusing you, so you probably won't need that much MR especially if Akali is their mid laner.

Usually people that do this are just trying to get sympathy from the community for the onerous task of carrying the bads they are matched with.  I get that you used a bunch of nice-sounding language, but fundamentally you're saying the same tired old stuff.

My advice to you is to not even worry about your feeding top lane and your feeding jungler.  Just focus on your own play.  *Not* just your mechanics.  Focus on your decisionmaking too, and your team coordination, your attitude in-game, etc.

I guess the real point underlying what I'm saying is that you are asking for advice about the wrong things.  You can get out of Silver just by playing better, you don't need to be a virtuoso of compensating for your teammates' mistakes.  To be frank, you are worrying about team cohesion issues that aren't a significant factor (when compared to personal mechanical and decisionmaking skill) until competitive, professional levels of play.  You can get to challenger on mechanics and good decisionmaking alone.  So focus on those, and stop writing the ""omg 1v9 gg can't carry these noobs"" stories, no matter how nice you try and make them sound."

I would say, it's mostly resentment, as you don't have to worry about making arraignments for going out. You don't have to spend extra money on entertainment or vacations, nor do you have to spend most of your income on raising a child. To them you are free of these obligations and in a sense you have complete freedom of finances and more importantly your time is yours. It's those freedoms they knew they were going to have to give up when they brought life into this world, so rather than accept this.

They justify their discord, by seeing you as immature and selfish and themselves as mature. So they go through the motions of being civil when in fact they are simply resentful and know it. "
sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390432889.0,"Real time streaming.  The TL;DR is that existing 1920x1080 displays at 60fps (for gaming) use 4Gb/s for just the display already, with no audio.  Video at 24, with compression can be successful at less than that, but there's a long way to go yet.  

Video streaming can be slow because it can be buffered and is actually at a fairly low framerate.  Anything interactive is actually quite a pain.

Let me crunch some numbers for you - I have a 75Mb connection roughly, it ends up about 9 MB/s transfer speeds.  That's fast.  But a regular old platter  drive can manage  about 70MB/s and a SSD 550-600MB.  

A 1Gb/s connection is only 125MB/s.  So why do you need or want more speed for anything?  Well who wants to do a 200 GB download at 10MB/s?   You *can* but faster is better.  Higher resolution content (4K tv), large games, streaming games  at interactive frame rates 

A 1920x1080 display at  32 bits per pixel at 60 frames per second, say a video game, is actually using 4Gb/s.  Now keep  in mind that you can do a lot to compress that data and so on (which is in large part what videos do), but raw data wise that's  a LOT of data.  And that's just one crappy display.  Multiple displays, multiple users, high res displays and 100Gb/s could seem inadequate in a decade.  Most displays are actually 24 bit colour displays (RGB each getting 8 bits, with the other 8 for padding/alignment meaning they are sent blank, but there are deep colour displays that use 10bits per channel for each colour, my team artist made me buy one as a graphics programmer, and honestly, I can't tell the  difference, but it makes him happy).  

HDMI 2.0 does 18 Gb/s - which is enough for 1 4K display at 60Hz  with some audio.  Imagine you, your spouse, and 3 children all trying to stream data at once.  100Gb/s and you are going to be running into problems.

Of course states said, ""Hang on...you can't bust our budgets like that!""

States are RESPONSIBLE for their budgets.  Of COURSE fiscal conservatives would see a Medicaid expansion as a budget buster.

It IS a budget buster.  It's proving to be as tons of new people are going on the exchanges and signing on for Medicaid.  This is NOT a good thing.  The idea was to have people on insurance policies, so that the government was NOT paying for their health care.

There IS Medicaid in these states, there's just no modified Medicaid that allows more people than before to sign up.

Don't you remember?  The goal was to get people onto insurance plans...not government-paid healthcare

Chances are if you show that you are willing to work with them, ask for help, and show then you care about your daughter they will be much more willing to work with you. Remember you and CPS are both on the same side: your daughter's. 

You're under a lot of scrutiny right now so you need to be on your best behavior. 

I think CPS will uncover the truth, if you tell them everything and well as you remember it, they'll probably realize that you are speaking the truth while your daughter is trying to further incriminate you by lying. 

In the meantime, someone needs to address your daughters behavior. Lying to a CPS officer to further incriminate someone and underage sexting with strangers (possibly child porn?) are dangerous behaviors that need to be prevented. However, given your current predicament, you're probably not in the best place have a conversation with your daughter. 

Maybe you could ask someone at CPS about how to help her? You could also raise your concerns to a trusted relative, counselor, teacher, clergyman ect. to have a conversation with her. You could even consider looking into counseling for her as well. 

Your daughter was right to go to the nurse with her concerns (though the lying was not justified) and the school was also completely right to ask CPS to investigate. 

If you are really concerned about this CPS investigation or about her accusations against you, remember you always have the right to remain silent and the right to talk to a lawyer for advice. That goes for all legal proceedings, not just issues of custody or abuse.

I don't really get this. It sounds like a cop-out. Do you see something and understand if it's good for you or not? If you genuinely do not know what is good and what is bad, it's time for you to do a little research. If it's just a matter of i-dont-think-i-just-eat, then you need to start thinking. You *have* to, if you want to get healthy - whether you're cutting or bulking, everything that goes into your mouth is important and is playing a role. Your diet is extremely important. Don't let this mentality continue if you really want to change your ways.

Anyway, MFP will allow you to enter recipes and then you can say you had a certain amount of said recipe. This is really helpful for homemade meals. I generally just eyeball exactly what I'm throwing together (well, eyeball the veggies and weigh the proteins and carbs) and get a basic idea of where I'm at. I'd definitely recommend using MFP though to track your food so you know where you're at. Don't bother with what they tell you you should be eating calorie-wise, just use it so you know what macros are going in.

kornberg,childfree,1390434133.0,"dude, why don't you just work with the bank and do a short sale? people are lowballing you because the other homes in the area aren't selling for the same price per square foot as what you're trying to get them to pay on your house. even if you got somebody to buy your house at the price you want, it wouldn't get past the appraisal because the comps would indicate your house is being sold for more than its value. it's not people watching too much hgtv, it's people not being able to get a loan on a house that is more than what the house is worth. if larger, nicer, more updated homes are being sold in your neighborhood for less than what you have priced your home at no one on earth ever is going to buy your house at the price you have listed. that's not Austin, that's math . 

You did not take care of your house, you can't expect to break even right after a recession in Pflugerville. the school districts in Pflugerville have low ratings, it's generally thought of as a poorer and less desirable area then Austin or Round Rock so it got hit harder in the recession than the rest of the city and surrounding areas and has not bounced back nearly as quickly.

I looked for your house on the MLS and I didn't see it, so I'm guessing you're not using a realtor. If you aren't on the MLS, then nobody is seeing that house up for sale, so all you're going to get is a bunch of crappy offers.

my advice is to get your listing on the MLS and to call your bank and see about arranging a short sale. you will sell your house for what it is worth, and the bank will either eat the difference or will split the difference and loan you what you owe if need be. sure, you lose some money in the long run but you haven't totally ruined your credit. the bank doesn't want your house, the bank wants the money it is owed. They will happily take a little bit of a loss to avoid the expense and hassle of having to try to sell your house. Foreclosures are well known to be a giant pain in the ass to purchase, banks are not equipped for selling property so they will usually do what they can to avoid having to do so"

spongemonster,AskReddit,1390434357.0,"Okay, here's one.  I won't even use a throwaway.

I went to school for electrical engineering. Graduated 2008, right at the beginning of the recession.  I did well, not amazing, but well enough.  Unfortunately, no one was really hiring right out of college.  I got a shitty part time job as a stock guy at a zellers.  It was just something so I could get by.

I received a call, it was a phone survey.  The survey was on behalf of my college, about post-graduate employment.  I didn't clue in to what it was all about until a few questions in.  They asked if I was currently employed, how skills acquired in college helped me get employed, etc.

The questions were phrased in a way that skewed it in favor of the college; even though I was working a shit-job with no future the college would be made out to look, statistically, like it got me some sweet career.  You've seen how schools advertise themselves with statements like ""85% of graduates from ______ College are employed within 1 month of graduating!""  Well it's these jaded surveys that allow them to advertise those numbers.

After I noticed what the survey was about, I got very agitated, taking my frustrations out verbally on the poor soul asking the questions.  Needless to say I ended the survey rather abruptly, and hoped that my information would be disqualified from the overall statistics.

The survey was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I wanted to get back at the damn money grabbing college.  Here I was, in an industry that was *supposed* to be booming, having graduated from a respectable college, and I had this shit job.  I figured I'd steal from the college.

Like any student, I spent a lot of time walking through the corridors of the college going from class to class, you learn plenty in passing about the where security cameras are pointing, which areas you have access to with your student card, what class schedules are like, etc.  I got it in my head that getting back at the school financially would be easiest if I just steal stuff.  Lab equipment, computers, and computer accessories were the first things that came to mind.

All of the computer labs had 1-2 cameras in them and just about every lab access corridor had cameras as well.  I noticed one lab didn't have very good coverage of the corridor entrance, so I figured that was the best place.  An added benefit of this lab's corridor was that it had exterior access to a courtyard that had minimal camera coverage.  This was also one of the labs that only had a single camera in it, and it was over the doorway facing into the class.  The outer casing of the camera blocked the camera's view of approximately a fifth of the computer lab (the majority of the first row of computers).

All I had to do was think of away to get the computers out of the school without looking overly suspicious.  A student dragging duffle bag from a lab, down two flights of stairs, and out an exit is not exactly subtle.  I can choose quiet times in the evening to do it in order to reduce any eyes on me.  Then I realized using my student card on any doors in the area shortly before or after the theft would link me to the crime.  So I had to do something for that.  Taping the door latches at some point earlier in the evening was a quick solution; No need for card access, and enough people would have passed through the area that I couldn't be linked to the taping.  Just had to hope no one takes the tape off.

I chose to do it in the evening; not so early that there would be lots of students/staff walking around, and not so late that a student would look out of place.  I approached the school on foot from the nearby student housing with a hockey bag stuffed into my backpack.  I didn't use my student card for anything.  I walked though the courtyard and carefully kept my face out of the line of site of the pan/tilt/zoom camera located there, but not in a way that would arouse suspicion.  I  entered through the unlocked door, made my way up the two flights of stairs and walked directly into the computer lab, again turning my face away from the corridor camera.

The lab was not empty, there were two people in the lab doing work.  Unfortunately, I didn't turn around there and go home.  I didn't recognize them so there's really no way they could implicate me in anything.  Anyways, I had decided to commit myself and wanted to get it done that evening.  I casually sat down at a station in the blind spot, logged in and killed some time until the people left.  Don't worry, I didn't use *my* log in information, I used a generic log in that's used for well...generic access.

It took a while, but the other students in the lab eventually packed up and left.  I took a peek out the door to see if there was anyone  around and then quickly disconnected the monitors, computers, and keyboards.  After another quick peek into the corridor I removed my hockey bag and started packing everything into it that would fit.  The hockey bag was full, but didn't look ridiculous, so I was feeling good about the situation.  It was heavy, but not unmanageable, so I opened up the door and headed out.

I headed directly for the stairwell leading to the courtyard.  I opened up the stairwell door an immediately heard someone coming up the stairs.  Fuck.  A series of scenarios immediately flashed through my mind, it's probably another student, what if it's a student that recognizes me, what if it's one of the students from the lab, what if it's a professor, what if it's a security guard, was I wrong about the cameras, is it the cops, is that even possible?

I've made my bed, time to sleep in it, so I say fuck it and decide to keep going.  I calm down and start walking down the steps to see what's in store for me.  The one flight of stairs it takes us to meet each other feels like the longest set of stairs I've ever taken.  Lo and behold, it's just a student.  Roughly my height, thin, blond, short hair - I don't recognize him.  He's got his head down reading something on his phone, barely notices me.  In fact, he doesn't notice me at all.  I know this because he bumps headlong into my hockey bag and loses his balance while dropping his phone.  I wish I could say the next few moments passed in some slow motion cliché but they didn't.  It was fast, and I only remember it because of the moments that immediately follow.

After being pushed a bit off balance by my bag and dropping his phone, I leaned forward and reach out to steady him.  But since I wasn't used to carrying such a heavy hockey bag around, I inadvertently pushed the bag into him even more and in the process sent him more off balance.  He fell backwards and started a short tumble down the stairs that ended with his head hitting the landing pretty hard.  I chased after him and put my bag down.  When I got up close I saw the small puddle forming behind his head. There was no sick crack, no yelp of pain, nothing to indicate he was hurt other than the still growing pool of blood behind his head.

I apologized profusely and asked if he was alright, but i received no response.  I thought he was dead, I froze.  I had literally no idea what to do - my mind was a mess of different things I knew I should do, but I couldn't make a decision.  Have you ever been in a situation where you realize there's about a dozen different things you should be doing but they all rank as equally important in your head (even though they're obviously not) and you can't decide which to do first so you just stand there motionless?  That's how I felt.  I was fucked.  Any way I looked at the situation I was fucked.  Call for help, fucked.  Walk away, fucked.  Stay here and do nothing, fucked.  I fucking killed someone - his life is over.  I've never seen a dead person before and here I was causing it.

But something kicked in, logic I guess or maybe it was actually disbelief.  I looked closely and noticed a rhythmic rising and falling of his chest.  The amount of relief I felt at that moment was...indescribable.  But it didn't last, because I knew I was still in shit up to my eyeballs.

I sat there, staring at his chest rising and falling for several moments.  And I couldn't help but think how close I was to actually killing this person, this random stranger.  I felt something in that moment that I've never since been able to replicate.  I was excited.  Inexplicably, incomprehensibly, excited.  It wasn't at the prospect of him being alive, it was at the prospect of me having almost killed him.  That I had come that close to doing something so permanent to someone else.  It was unlike anything I've ever felt before.

This whole time my attention had been split between the person on the landing, the puddle forming behind his head, and on the doors leading to the stairwell.  But after a moment my attention became more and more focused on his neck.  The steady heartbeat thumping away, the chest going up and down.

This is something I've told only one other person in the whole world.

I believe I experienced, in that moment, either a sudden lapse in sanity, or a sudden clarity.  I leaned over him and reached my hands out to his neck.  I slowly wrapped my fingers around it and started applying pressure, initially, not enough to do damage.  But bit by bit I applied more and more pressure.  I could feel the warmth of his skin, feel his pulse in my hands, feel the strain of his breathing.  It was like I was feeling the life in him, and the tighter I squeezed, the more I could feel in control of it all, the more *I* could feel alive.  I kept tightening my grip more and more until my hands hurt.  I don't know how long I knelt there, holding his neck, but by the end of it I couldn't feel a pulse, I couldn't feel his breathing.  As the lapse, or clarity, faded I put my hand on his chest and waited for it to rise or fall again. It didn't. I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling.  Gotta make you understand.  Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down."

NoStopImDone,AskReddit,1390434454.0,"So when I was five, we were sitting in a circle in kindergarten talking about what kind of punishments we received (Don't remember why, maybe it was in a book we just read). Now I had never done anything wrong, at least wrong enough to warrant punishment, so I had nothing to say, and I was jealous of the other kids who had their very own punishment.    
I decided to one up them all.    
I told the teacher that when my dad was mad, he would put me in a box and shake me around. When he was mad at my sister, he would stick her finger in an electrical outlet. Needless to say, my teacher was worried, so she had me tell the principal and then the superintendent, in both cases with me telling the same story with remarkable consistency.    
A couple weeks later child protective services came to our door to take me away from my parents. My parents had no idea what they were talking about, but since they brew beer for fun, there were empty beer bottles (Unused) lying around the house. You can imagine this helped their case. Anyways, the service interviewed everyone in my neighborhood, my school, and my family, and they all said my parents were completely normal. After a hefty investigation, it was decided that the five year old had merely told an elaborate story, so I was allowed to stay with my family.    
That night, my parents gave me my first time out."

Jesus. Half the people on the highways drive that much faster. In the US, at least in my area, typically you will see an entire lane going 15-20mph(24-32km/h) over the 55mph(88km/h) speed limit. If you do it at the right times you can drive past police going that speed and not get pulled over. In my state of Massachusetts you get a fine of $50(323.83kr) for the first 10mph violation and then an additional $10 for ever mph over the speedlimit plus a surcharge of $50.  So in total you only get a $150 fine for going 20mph over the limit. You need to be going well over 20mph on the highways to even be considered for a ""reckless driving"" ticket and even then it is subjective. "

She was found guilty because the court ruled that the law that you must fill out a census did not infringe upon her Charter rights. She has no ground to oppose the law as an infringement of those rights (which includes the right to not be unnecessarily searched, the right to expression of conscience, etc), and therefore broke the law without reason.

Her political griefs are valid HOWEVER, this does not give her permission to break the law. She has multiple ways of expressing her disagreement with the implementation of the mandatory census, but in no way was the judge going to allow her to not fill it out without punishment. The census is essential for all government processes, and allows the government to know the needs of its people. It is the one of the few mandatory democratic and civic elements of Canadian society as we do not have mandatory voting (as, say, Australians do). The other is taxes.

Now, **if she refused to pay her taxes** because she was upset with the government, would we even be debating this? **No.** It's only an issue because right now everyone is hyper concerned about the US's interest in collecting data on private citizens. The title is making it political when she is only using her politics as a justification to break the law, and the judge saw through it."

Until the bean counters want a sort of report on efficiency of patient service. It should be driven by the service providers interpreting the encounter for the time needed. A flat fee and limiting the hourly throughput would be my choice.

Buttercupslosinit,OkCupid,1390435385.0,"Your profile is vague and has quite a few cliches. Rattling off mundane adjectives doesn't tell me anything about you. I know your are thin, work in tech, and are new to the area. None of that makes me want to write you nor does it invite me to know more about you. Have you looked at the guidelines on the sidebar?

Starting from the bottom, message me if. I can't relate to anything you've written above, so that nixes the first thing. As for wanting to meet someone new to Austin, I'm sure that's nothing special. I generally recommend including a date suggestion, ""if you'd like to go to x to do y"" or if you have a rare interest, like herpetology or something, ask them to share something about that interest.

Most private thing. Leave it blank or answer it. I'll tell if you ask makes me want to smash my computer. You don't have to reveal your darkest secret, it could be something silly like, ""I like to watch musicals and know all the words to Oklahoma!""

Friday night. You do the same thing every other person on OKC does. Exciting! Going out? Where? Doing what? Tell me something you do or would like to do that makes me think I might like to do it too.

Six things. Boring and bland. This is a good place to be silly. I was helping a friend who is addicted to diet coke and he did not have that in his six things. Dude! You can't live without that crap, put it in there. I carry a tube of lip balm everywhere I go, I have a tube in my car, in my desk at work, and in my purse. That is on my list. This is a good place to be quirky and show some personality.

Favorites. Generally I skip these. Yours is ok except the music part. Take out the first two sentences. EVERYONE says except country. You are trying to stand out from the crowd and sell yourself, not be just like everyone else.

People notice your sense of humor? Can't prove that by your profile.

Doing with my life. This is a good place to include hobbies or interests outside of work. ""Looking for someone to have a good time with"" tells me you aren't serious about a relationship and are likely to hit it and quit it.

Self summary. Hardest part to write and also the most important. Yours is generic and boring. I don't know you well enough to offer any suggestions for this one.

Pictures are fine.

Questions. I don't have an account so I can't check your answers. Please google the steal/stale, wherefore, and number questions to make sure they are right. More people get those wrong than right and it's very annoying.

Overall, you are tall and attractive so you at least have that going for you. 

Good luck.

The_White_Baron,cheatatmathhomework,1390435882.0,"* y = 2^(x+2)
* y = 4^(3x-4) = 2^(6x - 8)

Set them equal since they intersect.

2^(x + 2) = 2^(6x - 8) 

Take log base 2 both sides

x + 2 = 6x - 8 

x = 2.

Plugging this in yields y = 16.

Being tangent to the x axis and y axis means it hits both exactly once.

So one point that the circle hits is (0,y0) and another is (x0,0). But the only way this can occur in a circle is if 

x0 = y0 = r = radius, meaning the center of the circle is at (r,r).

The equation for a circle is

(y - a)^(2) + (x - b)^(2) = r^(2) where the center is (a,b), or in our case, (r,r).

We already have a point to plug in (2,16). So, plugging in, we need to solve the following equation:

(16 - r)^(2) + (2 - r)^(2) = r^(2)

Solve it and you get r = 10 and r = 26. The smaller circle is r = 10.

The center is (10,10) and the circle has a radius of 10."

It was also really a short version of the stuff that went down and he said some pretty ugly things to me when he felt *hurt* which he already has said is something that still plagues him.

Whatever he does say or has said to his current gf is probably 17 levels of worse than what he's said about me. She's awkward and overweight and in debt by $100K+ so I assume he's really slammed her several times over verbally.

He would do that to me and then come crawling back with a feeble ""sorry bb I love you"" days or weeks after the fact. It's kinda why I have certain treatment of me dealbreakers now."

* Mood swings from day to day

It's really interesting to me [as an armchair expert] because the impression I get of Kanye is that he just generally puts his foot in his mouth a lot. I don't think he means the things he says literally, like comparing being on stage to going to war for example, but he has problems dealing with, and expressing his emotions properly.

The hate Reddit has for him is really something for me since they jerk so hard about any socially awkward nerd never being responsible for anything mean they say ever and if women don't like them they're poopie heads for not making allowances on a regular basis. The difference being of course that Kanye is incredibly talented and successful in spite of this, and they just can't stand it."

nesfor,Drugs,1390436295.0,"The thing about psychedelics versus many other kinds of drugs is that they really make you think and feel. In addition, they make certain problems unavoidable. If I have a bad thought when I'm smoking weed, I can just think about something else and in thirty seconds will have forgotten it; other drugs cushion your mind and make you feel good no matter what the circumstances. But on a long, psychedelic trip, any bad thoughts have an immediate and long-lasting impact on your happiness and your trip. It's an instant feedback system. When you encounter a thought that makes you unhappy, you have to figure out why, down to its very source, for better or worse.
That's why, for me, psychedelics are so worthwhile. You get to see some pretty colors and experience music, but you can also learn valuable things about yourself and become a better person that way."

If you're MtF, your dysphoria is either bad enough that you transition fully, or it's manageable and you continue living as male. There's really not an inbetween for us. That's why you don't tend to see a lot of MAAB genderqueer individuals.

From my experience, FtM's tend to have a spectrum where some decide to fully transition, some partially, some end up identifying as non-binary, or are happy without HRT. This just doesn't happen with MtF's.

You certainly don't need to care about ""fashion"" in the trendy sense, but you most certainly should pay attention to fashion in the ""how clothes look on you"" sense.

A lot of his female exes and friends use OKC and have told him what it's like being on there as a woman.

For me it's more that OKC is dating in a void. I don't know their social circles or how they talk to THEIR MOM or that they have a girlfriend or beat their ex fiance or spit on dogs until I'm already 1 month of dates in deep. I cringe at the idea of anyone hearing how I treated my first boyfriend and wouldn't want that as a testament for ""should I date her 20+ boyfriends later"" (random number of partners that isn't valid for me)? But still, seeing someone was engaged to some chick 2 weeks before you saw their message to you on OKC or that they were/are still legally married when you're not into dating Married Guy can help avoid awkward bad dates IMHO.

One guy wanted to meet at like 1am and there was nothing open. It was late summer.

He kissed me and immediately after I tossed a ton of cookies into the lake. I just lurched off the bench and heaved into the pond and then rolled over into a little ball of drunken misery. Dude drove me home and shook me awake (how I didn't end up dead IDK) and I stumbled into the door promptly slamming it in his face with a mumbled, 'thanks'. I also think I cried drunkenly about my ex who dumped me that night over the great banana peel in the wrong trash can incident.

The only remaining thing to try is this:

This story has seriously damaged the Society's reputation amongst many JW's. It's really *stumbled* many people. If the Guardian articles were slanderous, the Watchtower Society would be well within their rights to sue the Guardian on those grounds. ESPECIALLY in the UK where slander laws are skewed toward protecting the party that was allegedly wronged. (in this case, the Watchtower Society)

If the documents hosted at JWFacts are fakes or misrepresent the situation in any way, then again, the Society would be well within their rights to sue for slander and have them removed.

But they don't.

Why?

Because all entities involved know the documents are NOT fakes. Suing would only prove to current JW's that the situation was exactly as hypocritical as the critics said it was.

They have absolutely NO REASON not to sue if they are in the right. It's hurting their reputation every week as more people find out about it and their only defense is ""oh it's all lies"". 

If it were lies, they could even get financial recompense, but they don't pursue it? That's beyond belief."

There are some laws where being gender-different is either essential, or valid. Genderless parental leave would be nice, but no maternity leave is egregious because in *general*, women are the ones that need it. **Not just for child-rearing, but for the fact that childbirth is a physically traumatic medical event.** Women need time off to recover, especially if they have a caesarian which is a HUGE operation - you can't lift heavy things for months and months. If your job requires you to, and you have to go back to work two weeks after giving birth, you will lose your job. Plain and simple.

Also on top of that [unemployment is down 3.3%](http://portalseven.com/employment/unemployment_rate.jsp) from the height of the recession so we certainly can drop 3.3% of our employees again to compensate for wage increases.

bluesky747,MakeupAddiction,1390437631.0,"I've posted this before a couple weeks ago, but I've worked there and I think this will help you! 

I worked at a SiJCP for a while, but I can't imagine that the training for that was less than a free standing store.

I went in with an okay understanding of makeup and no professional experience in the field whatsoever. So if you're worried about not having enough experience, I wouldn't be.

They train you a lot on skincare and makeup. There aren't really lessons on DOING the makeup on clients, you kinda just have to do it and get the hang of it. There's also a test called a CMA (which is basically the 30min makeovers) where a Sephora Rep comes in and tests you while you do a full face on someone. I worked there for 6 months and I didn't have to do a CMA though. I did express services and some full faces during events.

Be prepared to watch a lot of videos and get a lot of knowledge of products thrown at you at once. There's a lot to know. The managers also make you do roleplay with them in order to help sell products better.

One of the best things are the gratis. Gratis are free gifts that the store gives you and they're usually full sized items. Skincare, makeup, brushes...anything! I got Philosophy's Time in a Bottle as a gratis once and gave it to my Mother in Law, and she never used it and now I'm kicking myself cause I wish I'd kept it.

Hmm..what else....every employee got a brush belt to use on clients. They teach you sanitation techniques and such. They teach you how to color match, use the Color IQ, and actually through experience you'll start to notice you can pick out people's undertones and surface tones by eye, almost perfectly, and finding foundation for clients will get much easier.
As a requirement, you have to go to work with a full face. So be prepared to spend 2-3 hours on your makeup for work. Sometimes there are specific looks that are agreed upon, whether for an event or for fun, but sometimes mimicking looks from instagram or a picture somewhere takes a while, so make sure you allow enough time for messing up, starting over, etc.

The best thing about this job is really the experience, skills, and knowledge you acquire (and the free stuff!) I'm WAY better at makeup now that I've had the experience, and it really has helped me on my way to starting freelance MUA. Oh, also, if you do freelance right now, be prepared to have Sephora tell you to stop doing it because it's a conflict of interest. My boss randomly came up to me one day and was like, ""You know you can't do clients' makeup outside of Sephora, right?"" It was odd cause I never hinted to doing anything of the sort, but after she said that, clients started asking me about it, so I'm pretty sure I'm going to do that. :) Yay makeup for a living!

Oh also...I don't know if you usually do other people's makeup but as someone who only practiced on themselves, doing makeup on other people is hard. Specifically eyeshadows and liners. And mascara. For SOME reason I can't put mascara on people cause their lashes just don't curl up. Maybe it's cause I'm too short...I have no clue. Aaaannnyway....yeah. Practice on your friends. A lot. And yourself. Practice, practice, practice!!

I can't think of anything else really, but if you have any other questions feel free to ask!"

Spend gems on rolling for heroes, you have a chance to get legendaries that way. 

Most people use upgraded archers or pyromancers, pick one of those and just upgrade them (and the better versions you unlock). But this is secondary to heroes, good heroes can carry you and higher level troops and higher level troop camps add Might giving you harder opponents. 

You may want to try and keep your Might down to have an easier time raiding. So look up all the things that raise Might and only do the things you really need, leveling good elite/legendary heroes is most important as they are the best for raiding/dungeons/HBM/defense. You can consume heroes that you have to get rid of the +Might they add. (Don't go below having 5 heroes though). "

If you do those things at the expense of the life of another human being, then yes, that is selfish. If you feel that another human losing his or her life is an acceptable price tag, that's selfish. Most abortions are not performed on women who will likely die without one, nor are most abortions performed on babies who are horribly deformed or not able to survive birth. Most of them are performed on healthy women carrying healthy fetuses, and are done because the mother would be inconvenienced by the child. Let's not try to pretend that most abortions are done for the good of the child, because that's not even close to being true. "

Plus, GB games tend to receive a greater ""CIB spike"" than games on most systems, and these are all in great shape from the looks of it. With all that in mind, I'm pretty sure $75 would be the bare minimum either one would realistically go for. More likely, you'd get around $100-$125 each. Congrats on a great find! 

Unfortunately, Tiny Toons is worthless even CIB. Sorry. It's supposedly pretty fun though, so at least there's that. "

* Charlie Coyle ($900K current, value: $2,925,000)

* Mikael Granlund ($900K current, value: $6,300,000)

* Erik Haula ($900K current, value: $3,500,000)

* Jonas Brodin ($894K current, value: $4,425,000)

* Marco Scandella ($1.025M current, value: $2,625,000)

On top of that, these guys are RFA after **this** year:

* Nino Niederreiter ($870K current, value: $8,475,000)

* Jason Zucker ($771K current, value: $2,500,000)

* Justin Fontaine ($600K current, value: $1,190,000)

* Darcy Kuemper ($776K current, value: $2,700,000)

All of the above with the exception of Fontaine and Scandella are entry level contracts.

We're going to need every penny we have if we want any chance of re-signing even half of those guys.  Zucker and Fontaine make good trade bait, though.  Especially for a ""rebuilding"" team.

It was talking about Neo-Nazis winning election in Greece, and Mein Kampf being a best-seller in the Middle East.  It was talking about rallies in Egypt calling for ""Another Holocaust"".  It was talking about state-sponsored Holocaust-deniers.

Actually we've been wondering if one of our kids has it - he has vomiting episodes where he wakes up around the same time in the morning, vomits violently for a few hours, and then recovers by lunch time. He gets dizzy too. [Here](http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/cvs/) are a couple of [sites](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20028160) with information that you may find helpful.

Beyond that, I don't know what to tell you. I'm not a doctor. I do know that CVS is tied in with migraines and exacerbated by anxiety or stress, though. I also know that it can be very hard to diagnose...often what happens is that you rule out all the other physical causes, and when you get to the point where there's no explanation and nothing wrong with you physically you are diagnosed with CVS. Definitely keep pursuing testing - make sure they look at everything, your liver and kidneys and gallbladder and ovaries and all of it.

The judge doesn't believe political opinions allow you to break a law which does not infringe upon her Charter Rights. This is what happened. If she had wanted to bring attention to the case, she could have plead guilty, because she had, in fact, willingly broke the law. Instead she (and her lawyer) argued that the census infringed on her Charter Rights, which is bullshit.

&gt; And as someone who happens to agree with her complaints, I think she has done a fine thing in bringing attention to this.

Then you're just as keen to waste time and money on something which is already deemed illegal. Why not spend that time and energy actually trying to change things rather than break the law? Why not write your MPs, engage in public awareness campaigns? Why not work from within a functioning democratic system rather than break the law?

nowthatihavefoundyou,RandomActsofMakeup,1390441259.0,"So, this is my current routine, but I am still working on finding HG skincare products. 

1. [Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes](http://www.target.com/p/neutrogena-makeup-remover-cleansing-towelettes-refill-pack-25-count/-/A-11536492?ref=tgt_adv_XSG10001&amp;AFID=Google_PLA_df&amp;LNM=%7C11536492&amp;CPNG=Health+Beauty&amp;kpid=11536492&amp;LID=PA&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=11536492&amp;gclid=CKfiwf2Fk7wCFa5FMgodRz0Awg) – I use these at night to take off face makeup. I just like to remove as much as I can before using a cleanser.  

2. [Clinique Take the Day Off Makeup Remover](http://www.sephora.com/take-the-day-off-to-go-P223704?SKUID=1123116&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=1123116&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla) – I use this at night on [Shiseido cotton pads](http://www.sephora.com/the-makeup-facial-cotton-P173726?SKUID=101220&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=101220&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla) to take off eye makeup. This remover takes off stubborn mascara and eyeliner like a dream- no scrubbing or pulling of the skin. The pads are amazing too- no scratchy edges or textures, just like a pillow for your face. I know the pads are pricey but I only use two a day (one for remover and one for toner).  

3. [Clinique 7 Day Scrub Cream Rinse Off Formula](http://www.sephora.com/7-day-scrub-cream-rinse-off-formula-P122661?SKUID=47936&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=47936&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla) – This use to be a nightly scrub, but now I only use it about one a week when I feel like the pads listed as #5 aren’t enough. It is an ok exfoliator, but the cost is not justified- I will not repurchase this once it is gone.  

4. [Clinique Liquid Facial Soap Mild]( http://www.sephora.com/liquid-facial-soap-P139000?SKUID=899336&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=899336&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla) – I used to use this daily morning and night, but just recently started using nightly only. I found my skin didn’t need the double cleanse every day.  

5. [St. Ives Scrub Exfoliating Pads]( http://www.target.com/p/st-ives-scrub-exfoliating-pads-60-ct/-/A-13903833?ref=tgt_adv_XSG10001&amp;AFID=Google_PLA_df&amp;LNM=%7C13903833&amp;CPNG=Health+Beauty&amp;kpid=13903833&amp;LID=PA&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=13903833&amp;gclid=CPPAncuHk7wCFc41QgoddBEAdw) -  I use these nightly after cleansing my face. This is a great AHA product. It is really gentle and has really calmed my skin down since starting it about a month ago.  

6. [Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2]( http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/clinique-clarifying-lotion/3146433?cm_cat=datafeed&amp;cm_ite=clinique_clarifying_lotion:336151&amp;cm_pla=skin/body_treatment:women:toner&amp;cm_ven=Google_Product_Ads&amp;mr:referralID=044a16db-83c7-11e3-9f1f-001b2166becc) -  I use this nightly after cleansing and exfoliating. I really love toners though some argue they are not needed. I just use a cotton pad and apply around my face and down my neck.  

7. [Benefit It’s Potent Eye Cream](http://www.sephora.com/it-s-potent-eye-cream-P283509?SKUID=1318344&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=1318344&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla) – I use this nightly. No special reason for this one in particular, it was just a deluxe sample from a beauty box. When this one is done, I will move on to the next sample.  

8. [Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion +]( http://www.sephora.com/dramatically-different-moisturizing-lotion-P381030?SKUID=1538354&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=1538354&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla) – I use this in the morning and night. I may or may not repurchase. I have alot of face cream deluxe samples waiting to be used.  

9. [Bye Bye Blemish Drying Lotion]( http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=prod5023023) – I use this at night for spot treatment though in the past few months, I have only needed to use this a handful of times- yay! It works really well at drying out whiteheads almost overnight and reducing the healing time for acne cysts.  

10. [e.l.f. Lip Exfoliator]( http://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-lip-exfoliator/-/A-14518360?ref=tgt_adv_XSG10001&amp;AFID=Google_PLA_df&amp;LNM=%7C14518360&amp;CPNG=Health+Beauty&amp;kpid=14518360&amp;LID=PA&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=14518360&amp;gclid=CKiN0qeJk7wCFcp_QgodTz8AhA) -  I use this nightly. I really love this to scrub off any dry patches on my lips.  

11. [Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Cream](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=prod2047623) – I use this day and night. In the morning, I will put it on before I do my makeup and just before applying lip color I wipe it away. It has really helped my lips. At night, I apply after exfoliating. My bf hates the smell though and always complains when we kiss. It is just a Vaseline smell- I don’t mind it, but he does.  

Missing from my line up is sunscreen. I know, I know I should be using it everyday. I am bad at wearing a separate sunscreen. I don't like the smell or the greasy feeling on my face. When I wear a full face, some of my foundations/bb creams have spf so there is that."

Now the best way to do that is far from a science, and I will not criticize your methods. I will say that I don't personally find an authoritarian-style, set the rules to the dumbest students style classroom to be effective in doing so. I prefer to start with looser rules, and take away privileges for those students that can't conduct themselves properly. By this method the message is that they are expected and assumed to be mature individuals from the beginning, whereas I personally feel that starting with all of the strict rules sends the message that they are expected to act like children and also serves to punish and belittle the students who do conduct themselves in a mature manner."

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskReddit,1390442017.0,"Whether you are with them because they tick all the little boxes on your Mister Right or Miss Right List, or because you are over the mooon with desire for their body, or because you love them for who they are as a person. If they were in an accident and were disfigured, would you stay? If they became disabled, would you stay? Do you really feel the level of commitment that powers the words ""in sickness and in health, for better or worse, in richer and in poorer, until death do us part""? Because if you don't really feel that way, don't get married. Make sure you are marrying your best friend. 

Whether or not you two can accept one another as you change - everyone makes it seem like you change in your 20s but that stops when you hit your 30s, but that's b.s. Humans, like trees, are a process and not an event: who you are right now is not who you will be in a decade, whether you're 25 or 55. Life changes, and we change with it, and if you cannot accept your partner with an open mind through those changes, do NOT marry them. Obviously there are a few changes that will be dealbreakers, like cheating or abuse. But other changes that aren't harmful need to be accepted just like you'd want them to do for you.

Whether you are sitting on your laurels expecting the other person to make you happy (or vice versa!), or you're willing to put in the effort and the hard work of keeping your relationship strong. Marriage is a slice of heaven when it's done right, but that's just the thing - you have to *do something* for it to be strong and happy. It isn't owed to you and it won't just magically happen. It's like a garden - if you just chuck some seeds on the ground and leave it untended, you'll end up with a patch of weeds and not much food. If you plant carefully in rows, weed it and water it, and shore up the weak plants that need more support, your garden will be beautiful and productive. Marriage is like that. If you aren't willing to put in the effort - if you can't communicate and aren't willing to compromise and be honest and tolerant and forgiving - your relationship will be a mess. So the two of you both have to figure out whether you're willing to do that or not. If you aren't willing to put in the effort, you will get divorced.

Whether you guys have an honest relationship or not. If you lie to one another - or if one of you does - marriage will be a mistake. If you don't feel like you can be honest with the person, don't marry them, and if it's because you're doing shit you know you shouldn't, they deserve to be with someone better. Relationships full of lies won't last. Being honest does two things: it keeps you from doing something you'd be ashamed to admit to your partner, and it ensures that you both have your needs met. Honesty, yo. It's relationship glue.

How you both feel about children - whose responsibility birth control is, whether you want kids, how many, how you feel about parenting (schooling, discipline, religion, etc.), all the important stuff.

Whether your life goals and personal values are a good fit...you don't have to be clones, but if your lives are going in totally different directions you may not be the right fit for one another.

Whether you trust each other or not. If you go into it thinking you need a prenup ""just in case"", don't get married. If you go into it thinking you'll just get a divorce ""if it doesn't work out"", you aren't ready to get married because that's quitter talk, and it shows a lack of understanding of the nature of marriage. Marriage doesn't just ""work out"" - as I said, successful marriages are made. If you don't get that you aren't ready.

Oh, and make sure the other person is not sexist (this goes for men as well as women!), because it will make your relationship resentful and unequal and will be a crappy environment in which to raise kids, should you have any."

Ajinho,talesfromtechsupport,1390442159.0,"Frustration understood.

&gt;The thing is however, regardless of the above, training a customer in something that an L1 would address if broken should also be a responsibility of an L1.

This is a very slippery slope and the very reason I disagree is represented in this rough outline of a scenario I saw happen in a previous workplace;

You have the person that doesn't even know how to right click so L1 tech teaches them how to right click, and suddenly they're calling the helpdesk to learn how to do more things every other day.

Then they hear of their office mate not knowing how to do this little thing; oh, helpdesk will help with that, call them.

So it goes until a few months down the track, 20% of tickets at L1  are instructional rather than break/fix, and they take on average 40% longer to close than break/fixes fixed on first call.

This stuff goes up the chain via metrics to Exec Mgmt, and suddenly the L1 staff are being told off for not working hard enough and not chomping through enough tickets per hour or some such shit.

Suddenly the manager of L1 negotiates with L2 manager that anything break/fix that is going to take more than X amount of time to fix automatically gets escalated to desktop support to take the load off L1. 

L2 start getting the shits with the extra tickets they are getting, complain to their manager, who suggests that L1 is fucked and don't know what they are doing.

L2 manager reports to Exec Mgmt and Exec Mgmt start an investigation into cost benefit of offshoring L1.

Fortunately in this scenario, offshoring didn't happen, but I left that company shortly after because of how this went down."

then i got to know how law enforcement really works when i tried to save a friend from an overdose, and again when i was raped.

the police are a necessary evil, but i am hard pressed to see even any good they are doing that is not far and away outbalanced right now by the evil they commit. when i think of the drug wars, the violent thugs we have in blue here in seattle, stupid shit like leaving shotguns on top of cruisers, the lack of courtesy they show towards women, the racism, and add it all up.... well, what do they do? pull over some speeders and drunk drivers? 

but then i remember that there are some situations where you really do need the police (such as, say, a bar brawl) and suddenly they seem a lot more useful. only, to what extent is that balanced out?

maybe i'm too jaded, but when i think about it what really irks me is that i hate that we NEED the police more than i hate them. so i'll try to live my life in a lifestyle where i need them as little as possible. and even if i ever do need them, i'll be skeptical if they're arrived to help me or to be the violent, brutish, power hungry thugs they've been made to be.

So when it's sexy for females to dress like little girls, how do the males separate sexy looking females from actual little girls? To me it seems like there ought to be at least some measure of confusion introduced with such a fashion trend.

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1390443235.0,"This is more an economics question than a historical one, mostly because those definitions are equivalent, albeit in a roundabout way.  The equation of exchange relates inflation to the money supply.  It says that  MV = PY, where M is the quantity of money, V the velocity of money (how often it changes hands), P is the price level, and Y is the GDP.  Fischer, who developed this theory in the 1900s, postulated that the velocity of money was constant in the short-term.  Converting this equation to a rate equation and eliminating the hypothetical change in V (if it's constant, it doesn't change), you get inflation rate = % change in money supply - % change in GDP.  So if all else is equal, an increase in the money supply leads to inflation.

Incidentally, the direct money supply-inflation relationship isn't exact in practice, it does a decent job of predicting inflation.  In real life, all else is not equal, but it's not a bad approximation.

And this connection is useful historically--apparently Aristotle noted the connection between the supply of money and prices, and an influx of gold to Spain from the New World caused a drastic increase in price.

in fifty years, the GOP will be viewed like the KKK is now: a once very popular, now rather embarrassing, group of racist uneducated rednecks who hated everyone yet somehow rose to wealth and power due to outdated racism and economic advantage.

no, really: i hope so. i really think the GOP is as bad as the clan, the tea party is their gruesome little grand wizard, and the can all roast in hell. and that goes for every single on of their supporters too, that wide base of fools and religious zealots. 

they would have me dead in the ground for my abortion. they would have my friends deported and dead for trying to get an education. the GOP and it's members are really some of the most delusional, two faced, worst people on earth. now, i'll not be doing the democratic party any favors here either, but i'll take that assortment of slightly incompetent but way less evil over the shitpile the GOP has become any day, and so would most of us who are not profiting from that shitpile or who are too ignorant to understand shit stinks. 

and it's supposed to be a surprise the GOP is unpopular? i don't know who is going to replace them but it's coming. the only reason they're so evil now is because they are like a dying and caged animal, most dangerous when fatally wounded. but they gotta bleed out sometime.

So what is a guy to do if he actually likes how a girl looks even though she's not the incarnation of the magazine's (almost cartoonish) standard of beauty? If he's percieved to be lying if he says ""You look amazing"" how else would he go about saying it? I can not really think of any better way than ""We both know you don't look like the girls on the cover of the magazines, but **I** really like how you look"". And that is what he's actually saying in the above example.

I really know nothing; I'm just trying to give my perspective. It just seems like a lose/lose situation to create for the guy addressing you if he's not allowed to state his personal preference as fact and not allowed to present his personal preference as subjective.

sexandtacos,AskWomen,1390443888.0,"Let's lead with the cons, just to spice things up!:

* I'm an introvert and require a little more alone time than your average bear to ""recharge"".  This sometimes makes people think I'm upset with them when I'm not.

* I'm not a big partier; I generally don't like being in big crowds of people.

* I read too much into stuff, and I worry a lot.

* I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about getting married/having kids someday.

Pros:

* I'm obscenely loyal...I won't even consider other men in ""that"" way once you and I are an item

* I am charming as fuck.  Your parents will love me (provided they're not exceptionally weird/standoffish).

* I'm hilarious IRL, OK?  Ask anyone.

* I will get super excited about good stuff that happens for you, no matter how small you feel it is."

The more *correct* information that goes out there, the better we are as a whole. Aside from the grammatical discrepancies in the article, it was very good. All this coverage of trans people is putting a face and a personality and a person to what was previously a dirty taboo word you didn't want to say too loud. 

I'm a trans woman. I fall on the intersex spectrum as well. I've done my fair share of activism in person and on the web. As such, I know the profound impact each little victory can have. I once educated one person who went on to educate ten more... and I've educated far more than that one person. Each and every encounter is important to building up an understanding of who we are and why these things are important to us. 

Think of it this way... each person we educate, and each person they in turn educate, is a new voter on our side to help shift the tide of things into our favor with greater frequency. 

You did come off a little strong, but I do understand where the passion and drive comes from. Just make sure you use that to address the things and people that need or deserve it.

K2TheM,motorcycles,1390444055.0,"Yes, the final drive speed is basically your ""actual speed"". As long as both wheels are on the ground your speedometer will show this.

As for how you match revs: Through practice. 

(note that speed for much of this really means RPMs or how fast things are spinning. Your ""actual speed"" is calculated on most motorcycles by knowing the circumference of the front tire and how fast it makes a full revolution. EG if the circumference of your tire is 10ft and it rotates at 5 revolutions per minute it is traveling at 50ft/minute)

When you are in gear, and the clutch is engaged (normal riding), your engine is ""rev matched"" to your current speed. This is because the engine is directly connected to the rear tire via the clutch/transmission/chain. When the clutch is disengaged this separates the transmission/engine from the rear tire allowing each to spin at a different rates. When you let the clutch back out after shifting up/down you are effectively rev matching the engine to the final drive (output shaft, rear tire, etc) through the clutches friction plates.

Over time you can take note of how many revs are dropped/gained when changing gears. With this information you can modulate the throttle when shifting to allow for smoother gear changes, and in some cases forgo the use of the clutch altogether once in motion (still need the clutch for stopping/starting).

Rev matching can be beneficial to both up shifts and down shifts, but is typically most noticeable when downshifting since you are going from a lower RPM to a higher RPM over the course of the shift. For up shifts this means letting off the throttle. For down shifts this means increasing throttle. Rev Matching is much easier on the clutch and generally makes your riding smoother. This is because you are ensuring the engine and the final drive are both rotating at the same rate prior to the clutch being re-engaged."
fiveifrenzy6,Guitar,1390444069.0,"I was in your same position once and I still cannot play gypsy jazz. But what I have learned is Jazz guitar and day by day I'm getting closer to that goal. Gypsy jazz is a style of jazz so when I tried to dive right into it i was finding that I knew nothing about jazz guitar and was lost. So what did I do? I took a big step back and started learning jazz guitar. It is definitely making my goal seem a lot more obtainable. 

So my suggestion, Start with the basics of jazz guitar. Jazz guitar is closely related to classical, metal, and blues somewhat, surprisingly. It uses runs on arpeggios and scales like you would in metal, uses a wide variety of 7th, 9th, 6th, etc.. chords like blues does, and is combine with classical technique in a way. So you have the skills to learn it. I would start by learning some jazz standards and licks. Get to know jazz a bit and what makes jazz, jazz.  Learn some jazz licks and work your way to gypsy jazz licks. There are a few key voicings and tones that make things sound really gypsy and you can pull those out of the licks/songs you learn along the way. 

Gypsy jazz typically has one person playing rhythm and another playing lead. Typically I've seen every teaching style start by showing rhythm first so you can get a feel for the chords and, well, the rhythm of the music because that is one thing that is most important to the styles sound.  So I take that as a clear sign to learn rhythm first. From rhythm then comes lead. Lead focuses on the chords rhythm is playing and accentuates the tones in and around those chords to create the wonderful solos you hear. Learning arpeggios for the jazz/gypsy jazz chords will be crucial to this skill. Identifying chords by ear will also be necessary if you plan on improvising. Jazz, in all honesty, will require a lot of theory understanding and ear training to be competent at unless you are just playing sheet music from sight. That is where I am struggling. I didn't learn much of that from the start so I am trying to really solidify my knowledge before I move too far. 

Anyways, that's all I've learned on my journey to gypsy jazz, the most elusive guitar style. I have some resources saved on my personal computer so once I'm home I'll see what i can provide if anything. "

keypuncher,askaconservative,1390444359.0,"&gt; The reason why we don't have enough jobs has nothing to do with trade. It has everything to do with taxes, regulations, and uncertainty associated with those things. Business simply don't see a return on investment in hiring more low-wage workers today.

You're right about taxes and regulations driving away jobs, but trade can play a part.

Free trade agreements are good for both sides, so long as there is an equal balance of trade.  When there is an imbalance, whichever side has the trade deficit is trading cheap goods for jobs.

To use your island example, imagine there are 6 people on each island, and universal demand for 1 each of both A and B.

On Island 1, before trade begins, there is enough of both A and B for everyone.  An oversupply, in fact, which drives down prices for both and causes some unemployment, because only a small fraction of the population is needed to produce all the A needed.  

On Island 2, before trade begins, there are shortages of both A and B.  Prices are high for both, but there is full employment, as all their resources are required to make as many as they can.

Then unrestricted trade is opened up between the two islands.

Island 1 now has an outlet for more of its A and B, and can put more of its people to work.  Because it is producing more of both A and B than it needs, it can sell the surplus to Island 2.

Island 2's market for A is completely swamped by the cheap A coming from Island 1.  Producers of A on Island 2 go out of business.  Island 2 imports B as well, since Island 1 has a surplus.  This causes prices for B to drop on Island 2 as well, and some of the B manufacturers on Island 2 will also probably go out of business.

In time, many of the unemployed on Island 2 will no longer be able to afford B even at the reduced price, because they have no income, further reducing demand, which will put more of the B producers on Island 2 out of business, increasing unemployment..."

temp9876,BabyBumps,1390444436.0,"This is one of those really tricky choices about babies.  There are so many MANY things you can do to be frugal and environmentally friendly, but they all require that little extra bit of effort.  You know?  Sometimes that extra effort is fine.  If you're staying home, don't have a laundry aversion, and don't have any other caregivers like your spouse or childcare provider that refuse, cloth is probably a viable option.  If you never seem to catch up on laundry and struggle to force yourself not to eat out regularly, it's a lot less likely that you'll stick with cloth over time.

Cloth has a higher initial investment, but costs less over time.  If you don't blow $500 buying them and you stick with it for 2-3 years, cloth is the cheaper option.  Disposables won't hurt your wallet as bad at the beginning, but they'll be inflating your grocery list every week like clockwork right through the end of potty training while cloth diapers are just using a little extra water and detergent.  Cloth is less cost effective if you're also buying and using disposables.

Even with disposables, you're supposed to dump the poop in the toilet.  I'm pretty sure nobody really does that though.  Which is one of the reasons they are so very bad for the environment.  Either way, they're really bad for the environment.

There are a few other links someone posted to other threads on the subject that have lots more info, there are other issues like skin sensitivity that people consider when making the choice.

For my family we just weren't up to cloth.  We both work full time and rarely manage to stay on top of the laundry.  We would have bought the cloth and ended up using disposables anyway.  So even though I think cloth is the better choice, sometimes you just have to recognize your limits."

Silly_little_pet,AskMen,1390444548.0,"One factor is, of course, time. Time always helps. Many problems can be solved by simply identifying how long you need to lay low emotionally and not take your own feelings to seriously. Remember that feelings are not sacred or special in any way. What you feel does not define you. Feelings are nothing but reactions to thoughts. If you think something else then you will also feel something else.

And that's the next point. Try to identify the thoughts that make you feel insecure and inadequate. Find out what those thoughts are and in which situations you're thinking them. And then start thinking something else. You can't just stop thinking these nonconstructive thoughts, but you can deliberately and methodically replace them with more useful ones.

It will feel weird and forced at first, but slowly you can get used to modifying your own patterns like this.

I wrote a massive wall of text, trying to give examples and provide almost step-by-step guidance for how you could go about this. Then I deleted it again. A stranger on the internet can not give you specifics about this without risking to either confuse or mislead you. Instead I'll urge you to look up some literature about Cognitive Therapy (not just a wikipedia article) and/or get in contact with a professional that specialize in it. It is a form of therapy that pretty much entirely disregards the reasons for why you are where you are, and instead deals with how you can move on towards where you *want* to be, with completely concrete techniques.

You don't need to solve all your personal twists with ""therapy"", but having a specific problem to deal with using these methods can be used for learning how to apply it wherever else you need it. It's a very helpful toolbox to acquire and is not something you only need if there's something ""wrong"" with you."

Also, being a professional prostitute shouldn't be glamorized and/or promoted.  You fuck for a living so people have something to jerk off to.  That doesn't make you special, nor should it be respected.

Finally, and probably the one that will get the most hate, but I think it's sad to see so many people with such low self esteem and self respect that they think showing themselves off in the nude will somehow make them a better person.

Also in Norwegian music awards there are extreme metal bands that receive rewards. I can't imagine a band heavier than Metallica or Megadeth getting such a reward. In Canada, we just recently added a metal category for the Junos.

Once I had a guy yell ""you're hot!"" at me from a ski lift (I was on the hill below), and last summer I had two people comment on my legs - one was a guy who said ""nice legs"" or something as he trundled through the intersection in his buddy's truck, and one was an older lady who muttered something to her coworker about how great my legs looked (I had to climb a ladder to get my kid's shoe off the roof of the building they worked in, and they held the ladder for me). Soooo...yeah. Small Ontario towns are nice like that - there's a lot less harassment and overall douchebaggery from men.

&gt;I often get comments from men along the lines of ""Nice tits"" right to my face, and I never know how to deal with it.

""Thanks, yours are nice too!"" might help. Tack on an over-the-top nickname like ""sugarpants"" and you might just get across to him that he's being rude.

superspeck,Good_Cop_Free_Donut,1390445742.0,"The traffic calming/coordination techniques that CA troopers and LAPD use are really fascinating. 

I've been on a freeway in LA and seen a pair of of police cars pull in front of me, and then turn on their lights and start swerving across all the lanes. Mind you, this is on a freeway that's at least six lanes in each direction, and they slowed us from ~70-80 mph to about ~25 mph. Just ahead of us, a car being chased by a dozen police cars pulls onto the freeway. While the chase was in front of us, onramps were closed using more police units. After said target, and it's trailing police units, exited, the police cars slowing traffic turned off their lights and exited. Someone, somewhere, coordinated the timing well enough that they slowed (not stopped!) traffic by the *bare minimum necessary* and also *closed as few onramps for the minimum necessary* to allow a police chase to enter the freeway, travel in it's own bubble without endangering anyone else, and then leave the freeway. 

I majored in logistics in college, did theater as an elective, and in the past have managed IT programming teams (the latter of which basically fall under 'Herding Cats' on my resume). The whole idea that someone can get the police units to the places that they need to be and doing what they need to do with that level of coordination ***blows my mind.***"

Renner1,syriancivilwar,1390446434.0,"Except when he says things that aren't factual, or only partially factual.

The opposition in Syria, although in a severe state of disarray, is by no means absolutely dominated by Islamist entities or conservative Islamist thought.

Likewise, Libya isn't in the best straits at this point, but the nation isn't ruled or dominated by Islamist or takfirist factions, and dangerous people or criminals not being dealt with or apprehended by the authorities isn't due to ""we don't care that there's Al Qaeda figure walking around"" as it is more to the less-then-stellar political situation, mostly related to the infighting and the people who want to secede from the rest of the nation.

Regarding Syria again:

I'm most definitely anti-JAN, IF, and obviously anti-ISIS-- although I do take into consideration that numbers of people possibly have joined these groups for pragmatic as opposed to ideological reasons. 

Saying this, one should say that these people in question should defect away from the groups they joined out of pragmatism, now that there are far better openings to do so. There's no real excuse to stick with them anymore as the openings for defection have widened considerably.

IAmNotAPerson6,funny,1390446434.0,"You must understand the way insults work though. When you use a word as an insult, you imply that that thing is *bad.* As other people have pointed out, we don't use words like ""nigger"" or ""faggot"" like this nearly as often because there's heavy emphasis on not being racist or not hating gays. This is because when you use ""nigger"" or ""faggot"" as an insult, you imply that it's bad to be black or gay. Same thing with any insult. So, since ""retard"" is a common insult, there is the implied meaning that being mentally handicapped is a bad thing (obviously people don't *want* to be mentally impaired, but you know what I mean).

Now I know we jokingly insult our friends all the time, I do it too. And I know you're not going to stop calling your friends retards. It's just something to think about."

Of course it is a valid argument.  The Social Security beneficiaries have a contract with the government to provide benefits in exchange for their payroll taxes going into the Social Security Trust Fund.  That corrupt government officials spent the money before it could be paid out does not invalidate the contract.

&gt; Most will also receive in more then they paid even after taking into account the amount they would have had if they had invested it.

Not when you count in the real inflation rate, as opposed to the official one, which artificially reduces the increases in food and energy prices.

I don't think we should do the Rome-analog / France-analog / Viking-analog / Caliphate-analog countries. I hate those. For me, it's really that people try to be really serious about their worldbuilding and then their countries are cartoon countries. If you're going to write a realistic reality, then you need to have realistic rules.

EDIT: And in my short experience as an aspiring writer, it's *hard* to write believable worlds that aren't like real life. The more and more you try to expound on cultures and races the further you get from your story, and if you don't expand, people hate your races and characters."

blaghart,gaming,1390447862.0,"It also has a far larger fanboy cult, since while many people like nintendo, they continue to maintain that the Wii and the WiiU is the console of ""casuals"".

couple that with the fact that the WiiU doesn't have a generic rehash of a previous FPS with some flashier graphics and a lot more bugs and it's not surprising why it isn't more popular.  No 12 year old wants a WiiU and Nintendo fanboys are buying DS's instead because DS's have things like a game resembling a Pokemon MMO and a new zelda.  Two things the WiiU doesn't have (no, Wind Waker is not a new Zelda despite how much Nintendo tried to hype it up as one).

In fact, Wind Waker for the WiiU is the exact proof of why the WiiU and Nintendo's fanbase is totally different from the PS4's or XBOne's:  While XBOners and PS4 fanboys will buy a console for the same game with shinier graphics, that's not enough to sell Nintendo fanboys.  They want actual gameplay additions, which the Wind Waker rerelease didn't have in the same vein as, say, Master Quest for the Gamecube."

Secret_Wizard,Borderlands,1390448106.0,"One thing you should know is that Rocket Launchers suck really badly in this game. They barely scratch anything. Don't bother with 'em, even the Legendary ones.

Second thing you should know is that gun brands don't have their own niches. Hyperion doesn't become accurate under sustained fire, Jakobs doesn't fire as fast as you pull the trigger, Maliwan fires actual bullets, Torgue can be non-explosive, etc. Oh, and weapon qualities are a bit more blurred. Expect to find blues better than purples, purples better than oranges, etc.

Third thing you should know is that, provided you have the Game of the Year version/own all DLC, you can pretty much max out the talent tree. No need to pick and choose a build in this game. You'll have more talent points than you know what to do with. Anyway, on to the characters...

Roland is the closest thing to Axton. His Scorpio Turret, however, is pretty dang bad compared to the Sabre. Roland can excel with Assault Rifles of all kinds and Shotguns, and has the power to increase the clip size of his guns by massive amounts, maybe even double them. Turn a 6-shot revolver into a 12-shot, a 32-round SMG into a 60-round bullet hose. Combined with some ammo-regeneration powers and fire-rate-increasing kill skills, Roland can just spray bullets all over the battlefield.

Lilith is stupidly powerful. Once you get some perks going, you're not going to die again. Phasewalk allows her to turn invincible, invisible, and super-speedified for a short while, and with the perks she can regain health and shields while phasewalking. She excels in Elemental weapons of all types and Sub-Machine Guns. She really plays like a twice-as-powerful Maya, except she can just go invincible instead of locking an enemy in place.

Mordecai can rival Lilith's raw power, but he is the most fragile and vulnerable character and he requires accurate aim to play. Bloodwing is pretty lame on his own, but with every perk that powers him up, he can practically fight everything for you akin to Axton's Sabre Turret. He excels with Sniper Rifles, Pistols, and Revolvers. Long story short, if anything gets crit-shot *once* by Mordecai, they're dead. One of his talents allows you to bypass shields and damage enemies straight to their health. Kind of mediocre except when facing Eridians, who have colossal shields but meager HP.

Despite his appearance, Brick is probably the least powerful of the four. That doesn't stop him from being my personal favorite. Where Lilith avoids damage, Brick soaks it all up and doesn't give a crap. The big man excels with Rocket Launcher (ugh), explosive element weapons, and melee combat. Unfortunately, his Berserk loses its usefulness fast and only serves as an out-of-combat health regen skill at level cap. Brick begins combat slow, but after a single kill, those ridiculous Kill Skills of his kick in and suddenly you are a living god of death and everything turns to red mist. If you manage to find yourself a half-decent Ogre (assault rifle that always deals major explosive damage), you'll be unstoppable forever.

Oh, one last thing... Maliwan Hellfires are absolutely stupidly overpowered. I had one that was level 12 and it lasted all the way to level 50, where I found a better one. If you find one, rejoice!"

The biggest problem here seems to be that most houses' panels are far from the kitchen, making the necessary extra home runs cost $100s in wire alone. In newer houses, they're putting the panel on the outside of the house at the kitchen, which is smart. 

Your city building department would be the one who could guide you most accurately in this issue. "

If you want to go by the whole ""Words are just sounds"" thing, sure. You can be literal and miss a ton of meaning.

If you can shake off any insult by just thinking that it's only a sound someone made with their mouth, great, embrace your inner stoic if you want. But people who can't do that and think about what an insult *means* and are affected negatively by it deserve better than a ""Get over it."""

If I'm busy, or just not in the mood to track everything for the day (it happens sometimes), I know the stats for these meals and can just have whatever combination adds up to my daily macros.

jpieples,AdviceAnimals,1390449210.0,"You can ALWAYS apply. It really can't hurt, plus if anything, you're grinding your interview skillz.

But good places to start are either hardware/software call center, or a helpdesk spot at a med/large company. They usually need at least 1 or 2 to do all the grunt work. Don't be surprised if you aren't making a LOT of money right off the bat. Do your time, pay your dues. Volunteer to help with everything. Absorb all the material you can like a sponge, and be ready to kiss ass and take names. The higher tier techs will usually be glad to teach you the things they know (mostly because it can lead to taking some work off of their plates) and sooner or later you will be eligible to take a higher paid spot. Taking some classes and getting a few entry level certs can't hurt either (A+, Net+, Security+, MCP for server or desktop, Vmware, and Cisco are all GREAT places to start.)"

Now you can have something be sexualized just as something can be gendered, but transgendered is no more appropriate than homosexualized would be.

1. The monster they are fighting is a boss, and combat effects will be less pronounced.

Now, the problem is, as someone who thought combat in the latest beta was pretty good, I can't really talk about it without breaking the NDA.

Our ""intuition"" is an evolutionary mechanism that puts us on alert, even if we don't consciously realize why.  Say there is a predator tracking you, and a few particles of its smell hit your nose.  It's not enough for you to consciously identify the smell, but your olfactory nerve  still senses it enough for your brain to sound the alarm.

Unless you're talking about how you somehow ""knew"" which door had the grand prize behind it.  That's just luck and confirmation bias."

jpieples,AdviceAnimals,1390450149.0,"I'll be honest. I started at a geek squad, but in a position labeled ""counter ops.""  It basically meant I got to be customer service and do little to no actual computer repair. I picked up slack where it was left off, but you're unlikely to get a position fixing computers in there unless you're already trained/certified, or your best buy is very understaffed with less than technical people. This would probably be more of a last ditch effort to get into IT. There are a lot of people out there that have a strong distaste for Geek Squad, and it could affect you getting a position somewhere else.

As far as call centers go. I mean find a company that has a computer related product. Medium to large software companies are usually good places to start (although if you can work for a call center for a company that makes computer parts and you have to troubleshoot drivers, that could work too). But realistically, any call center where you will have to troubleshoot problems with an operating system, hardware, and software.

But honestly, the most important part is the volunteering. I can't tell you how much it helped me. Literally, jump at any opportunity for extra/different (related to your position or the position you're trying to get to) work that comes around. Even if it means taking the crappy hours, or even working overtime/weekends when everyone else isn't. Initiative like that will get you VERY far in the helpdesk world. Especially considering that most IT jobs come with a 24/7 emergency on call line in your job description."

Neebat,todayilearned,1390450193.0,"Depends on the state/country and more importantly, it depends on the accounting!

Let's say you sold a widget with a brand name.

* The brand name is owned by the corporation in one location.
* The website selling the widgets is hosted somewhere else.
* The widgets are manufactured by people in China.

Now, where is the revenue happening when someone buys a widget?  

Answer: Where ever the tax laws are most favorable.

So, even if the revenue were realized in the location where the majority of the employees reside, the company they work for could be barely breaking even every year.  Sucks that they have a royalty agreement with another company to use the brand name and trademarks for the widget, and that agreement sucks up every single penny of profit.  And the company that owns that IP happens to be in a low-tax location, so turns out, neither company owes any taxes."

But I'm honestly wondering; is this prepared enough for a full-on horde invasion?  I have the Sunset Invasion DLC for the first time, and I'm not sure what to expect.

Also; as I have inherited the Byzantine Empire, I'm wondering - should I relocate the capital to Constantinople?  I have no wishes to form the Roman Empire and restore it to it's former glory, but rather just play as a 'really powerful Poland'.

Final question; if I do eventually convert this to EU4, will the Wendish Empire just have the standard national ideals, or will it be ideals of the Commonwealth/Poland?  And will me having two Empire-tier titles conflict with the transfer?"

Willravel,startrek,1390450489.0,"They're Ancient Sparta, or, at least, the popular modern view of Ancient Sparta. 

Sparta and Athens really came into their own around the same period of a few hundred years. They were both powerful militarily and economically, but despite this they were diametrically opposed as cultures. Athens had grown from a timocracy slowly but surely into a quasi-democratic city state. In the wake of the Persian Wars, Athens maintained the Delian League and became a substantial center of wealth, power, and culture. They developed the first schools of their kind, attempting to attract teachers from all around, and the emerging middle class was taken under the wings of the Sophists. Art, literature, debate, and philosophy were everywhere. Sparta, on the other hand, remained oligarchical after the Persian Wars, with a ruling warrior class of 'equals', and under them the Helots, a large, subjugated population. Just as Athens maintained the Delian League, the Spartans had their Peloponnesian League. Despite this, however, the Spartans remained essentially equal in power to Athens. 

This slightly over simplistic historical example is really great for understanding the relationship between the Federation and the Klingons. The Federation is quite progressive for its time, it's democratic, it values intellectual pursuits and has a thriving population overall. The Klingons are quite conservative and militaristic, with emphasis on ability to wage war and with a massive, largely unseen subjugated population supporting the bloated military state. 

The Klingon Culture, like Sparta, is based around their ruling warrior class maintaining order and being able to protect and pursue the interests of their houses and the state. It's a system which we might see as archaic and needlessly violent, *but it's a culture which has led them to great success*. Klingons' warrior culture was how they were able to defeat the Hur'q, how they were able to take to the stars to extend their Empire, to subjugate new worlds to support their ruling class. The Klingons are one of the most powerful civilizations in the quadrant, easily a match for the Federation or Romulans or Cardassians most of the time. The warrior culture has given them wealth, power, and security, and provides them individually with a sense of fulfillment and ambition to succeed. 

As for the bat'leth, of course it would be a clumsy weapon for humans. It's not the process of centuries of weapons evolution designed to be used by humans. It's a weapon meant to be used by humanoids with greater strength than humans, less shoulder range of motion (like having two humerus bones), and much, much stronger wrists. Like Klingons. 

Do you know what happened with Sparta and Athens? They went to war, and Sparta won. Athens surrendered in 404 BC and Sparta would slowly continue on for hundreds of years until it began to decline due to a number of factors. Something to think about. "

gingerkid1234,nfl,1390450598.0,"&gt;I feel like doing your HW on a game should affect the game, I do agree that if that call was against the Jets I would initially be upset. But in the end, Rex/Jets did their research in advance which is not much different from any team studying the other teams Offense/Defense (difference between sportsmanship and gamesmanship). 

It is, though.  It's not doing homework to know who to play, or what routes to run, or what plays to call, it's knowing what to say to the refs.  And that rubs me the wrong way.

&gt;You definitely make a valid point, but in the end I have gotten tired of Patriot fans taking every victory away from us (I understand I am stereotyping right now but the amount of times I have had patriot fans tell me after the jets beat them either ""we lost the game the jets didn't win the game"" ""the refs totally won that game for you"" ""the jets are no good you just got lucky"" is un-countable. You seem like a decent dude and made a solid point, I just have had to deal with too many NE fans while in college at QU that I have become agitated by teams taking credit away from us.

Heh...I've got the opposite problem.  I go to school with a whole bunch of Giants and Jets fans.

Anyway, I appreciate the comment.  Mostly, my griping doesn't have much to do with this game, either--I'm tired of fans in general, including /r/nfl, bitching at Pats fans for whining about calls when every other fanbase does the same thing.  The Saints and Browns fans did, too, and rightfully so, but I don't think they got the negative reaction we did.  And lord knows no one's forgotten the Tuck Rule Game, where fans have been complaining about us ""winning the super bowl on a bs rule"", even though we still had to drive to win the game, not to mention beat the Steelers to even get to the Super Bowl.  

Maybe it's because we're seen as the football goliaths, and I get that.  But the happiness of winning it all kinda fades after a decade of playoff disappointment.  We haven't won it since SB39, even though we've been to the playoffs all but one year.  That's approaching Bills-level playoff sadness.  And I've been surrounded by Jets and Giants fans for the last bit of it.

tl;dr I feel your pain.  I am also somewhat drunk.  Fuck the Giants."

Then F + f = C = R + r (because we started out with identical amounts of coffee and cream).

Also, F + r = C = R + f (because one tablespoon got transferred from one cup to the other, then a tablespoon went back).

So F + f = F + r.

Subtracting F from both sides yields f = r. So there is just as much coffee in the cream cup as there is cream in the coffee cup. And since that does not match either option (A) or (B), then (C) is the only possible answer."
