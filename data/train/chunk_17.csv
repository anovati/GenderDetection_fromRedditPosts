allenstenhaus,AskReddit,1389430714.0,"I have always been fat. Grew up with little in the way of money, so we ate a lot of empty calories. When I ate a lot, I was told by many I was just a growing boy and I would thin out when I grew up. When I was a teenager and even heavier, I was told not to worry because I would hit my growth spurt like my father and thin right out. 

Unfortunately, nobody knew I had PTSD, anxiety, and chronic depression. I rarely went out, even alone, because just dealing with people at school exhausted me. I led quite a sedentary life. I ate way too much because it was the only thing that ever made me feel better when I was down. 

Then high school was over. What little social interaction school provided me was over. I went into an incredibly deep depression that lasted over a year with not a single day of feeling normal.

Then I got into a bad relationship, which coupled with my depression wrecked me. Prior to I was overweight, but even a doctor would not have called me obese. This girl, though... I had no idea the damage she did to me mentally. In six months I gained fifty pounds. I hated myself and hated life. She cheated on me with a friend, so deeper down the hole of despair I went. My good buddy Food was at the bottom with me.

Another 30 pounds thanks to a stressful desk job brought me to 305. I wasn't muscular at all. It was all fat. Worst part was, I saw the number on the scale, but when I looked in the mirror, I didn't see a fat guy. I still saw the kid who was
80 pounds lighter. It was like being anorexic, but seeing a thin person in the mirror when one wasn't there. 

Then a few years later at 25 I blew out two discs in my back. I had never experienced such pain. Spent the next four years hooked on Vicodin, but on the plus side, I was more active since I was high all the time. I also ate less because the drug gave me what food gave me before. In this time I got down to 239 and actually looked damn good. Had I hit my goal of 225 I would have been very lean since I packed on a lot of muscle at the gym. 

Then two years ago marital problems kicked in and I went into another depression. I kicked the drug habit because it was starting to affect my mind in very real and scary ways. I ballooned back up to 275 in a few short months. 

Now I sit here hating myself again for being at this weight. I am trying to make progress, and like many, I started on New Year's. Only down two pounds, but a pound a week is a good safe rate. I want to get to 239 again and get down to 225 for the first time in my adult life. 

I'm afraid, though. I'm afraid another depression will hit. I'm afraid I'll lose the weight again and then go into another depression and put it all back on. I'm 31 now... losing weight is harder than ever. I'm afraid if I lose it again and balloon up again, I will give up entirely. That thought scares the hell out of me.

If only my depression and anxiety had a cure. They are the root cause of all my problems, weight or otherwise. 

That's my story. "

Norwegian grammar isn't very difficult, so it actually shouldn't take you very long. I used something called ""Norword lessons"" to learn the language at first, they may be very old (coming up on 20 years, and the website reflects that to be honest) but somehow they were pretty brilliant at getting me to understand the language. I'd recommend ignoring the poor transcriptions of how it's supposed to sound and just reading the theory bits.

Orangerrific,AskReddit,1389431147.0,"Even though my parents both grew up in the Deep South, they are both agnostics/atheists, so my brother and I just never really went to church. Religion was just something we didn't really care about, or even knew existed for a long time. Kids at school talked about ""God"" or whatever, but we didn't know it was rooted into something called ""religion"". We knew kids who went to church, but we just didn't know what churches were for. We didn't quite grasp the concept of religions until we were older.

The only time I ever went to church services was either when I was visiting family and they went to church (usually a Baptist or Methodist church), or if I spent a Saturday night at my best friend's house and sometimes I'd go to church with them in the morning (they went to a Catholic church). Even at a young age, it didn't appeal to me simply because I found services I went to extremely boring. Once I got into high school, I started learning about other religions through my history classes, and then doing my own research. It didn't take long before I knew religion just wasn't for me.

My parents, my brother, and I are probably one of the few households in the state of Georgia where everyone who lives in said household is an atheist."

LolaRuns,Games,1389431687.0,"I'm getting to the point where I think emotional response itself (or rather the way it is being handled in games lately) is a clichee onto its own. 

And while it might not be the first to do it, I think it can still stand as a noteworthy entry for: 

- Communicating these themes without cut scenes (compared to let's say Last of Us or Walking Dead). Sure one can argue that listening to an audiolog really isn't that superior to watching a cut scene (as you can still walk around while listening to it but you can't really interact with the audiolog itself) but at the point where it came out it stood out more because more games that were released around that time used the cut scene approach. 

- Communicating a story that is pretty atypical for games. Certain things like shooting or beating people, as well as racing or trading are very easy to gamify, mundane life or ""falling in love"" is harder to gamify in a meaningful way. (for example, how do you keep it from the typical quest/reward structure you find in games typically, something that many romance themed games from dating sims to Dragon Age struggle with) In that regard one has to wonder if it isn't cheating that they achieved that by having the love story be experienced by a supporting character rather than the main character, the main character just observing it rather than experiencing it. (and if you look at the game as the player having mixed feelings about ""their"" family, how successfully did it achieve that) [I do think it's kinda smart how the game plays with your expectations of it being about more typical game topics like superantural stuff and mystery and then subverting that expectation]

There have been other games with you exploring an interesting environment while a well written audiolog plays in the background (like the Mad Scientist House/Ghost Hotel in Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines or Bioshock) and a lot of those also start off with the environment being surprisingly abandoned. They usually use it to finally set up enemy encounters and Gone Home just completely omits that part. One could argue that that is fair since for many people who enjoyed those audiolog experiences the enemy encounter actually wasn't the point and exploring the abandoned location really was the most memorable experience. I do think that asking the ""do we really need that"" question can be worthwhile. 

But is ""doing this thing we have seen before and applying it to a topic less frequently explored in gaming and not necessarily explored in this combination of theme and mechanics"" really enough to be standout long term? "

Lodekim,AskMen,1389431764.0,"There could well be a failure to launch epidemic.  The causes can include difficulty finding work, low pay being the norm across a lot of fields, and some social factors as well.

There are a few important things though here that are relevant to your perspective.

First, the economy shit the bed HARD in like 2007/2008.  At 31, you got your foot in the door right before that.  If you started working without university you got in well before that.  Mid 20s means they graduated right as the economy was falling apart.  There will of course be fewer people seeing the same economic success as you and your friend.

Next, based on your post and answers, you are looking for a very specific kind of man and don't seem to be admitting it to yourself.  I believe you that it's not exactly about money, but it's about drive in a way that matches specifically with your values.  Ask yourself if you'd be satisfied with a musician who was mastering their craft while working at a supermarket.  Maybe they'll make it big, but the odds are against them, no matter how good or driven they are.  What about someone driven to succeed at a sport that doesn't bring in a lot of money.  Skateboarding, or lacrosse, or weightlifting, or whatever.  I'd wager these don't meet your expectations.  You're not after money specifically, sure, but what you're after pretty much leads to money, so you're going to have to accept that and look at the right place.

Note: I'm not trying to say you're looking and failing, I'm just telling you that the men who are going to match your specific criteria are going to fit specific patterns, and it's not going to be the majority of guys."

Not to mention who says that optimizing in itself isn't something that gives some people pleasure (just ask anybody to obsessed over their gear choice in a hack and slash or over their build choices in an MMO)? 

(and LLTQ is different from adventure games by having a variety of paths towards the same goals with a variety of *mutually exclusive* ""story pockets"" that the game strongly encourages you to explore via its achievement system which predates its steam version)

Yes LLTQ is a game that uses failure as a design mechanic. So what? It's a design choice like any other. As a balancing factor is makes retrying/restarting easy. (and the achievement system rewards you for failure in giving out achievements for getting all different types of death) Sure the game, imo, intentionally shits all over some beloved design concepts but imo it does so in service of the main theme and atmosphere (your main character is a clueless young girl surrounded by constant danger and intrigue, the game is not fair in the conventional sense, but neither is her position in life at that point and you have to navigate her world by (ideally) using common sense and paying a lot of attention to everything that happens around you =&gt; very thematic I would say).

I am not a fan of these backhand compliments either. 

That said, my favorite moment (among many) was a group of ""tatted up"" teens who got on in Watts giving a French couple (who barely spoke English, clearly tourists) directions on how to get to the Queen Mary from the train AND give them ideas for the rest of their trip in LA. 

My favorite train person is the Train Ninja. http://i.imgur.com/XsQQkdq.jpg I took this photo in May of 2011. He was very nice, polite, and was explaining to other passengers about his ancient herbal remedies in pouch handing from that cord around his neck. Suddenly he got his shit together, stood up (while the train was moving, hence the blur) and stood like this for a solid minute. My stepbrother, traveling with me, texted me ""If he vanishes in a puff of smoke I may lose my shit!"" and it took everything I had to not explode laughing. 

Also, give that the blue line is above ground most of the time, you also get some really entertaining one-sided phone conversations.

Because even if it is cheese, there can still be a certain purity in that yearning even if it isn't realistic. (and I doubt that they would be the first devs who channeled their own childhood and worked off what they would have dreamed off at that time) 

The question is whether it really is superior than any ""beating up the bully"" or ""getting the sweet yet hot girl next door"" or ""being special/being the chosen one"" fantasies in topic or whether it at least it was superior in the writing that went into making that topic come alive.

What purpose would it serve, evolutionarily?  We tend to rationalize and explain away the things we cannot lay facts to, and for some reason there is a subset of humanity that seem to be truly scared of admitting that ""we just don't know"" is a potentially valid answer to these things.  They must be explained (no matter with how absurd), and death is truly the unknown, and the reason a ""soul"" would be needed in the first place.  I believe quite firmly that most religions exist primarily to make people feel better about this, thus the ""soul"" thing as we can all see quite clearly that body doesn't continue on after you stop being.  This tends to make people fearful, so we've found a way to assure our minds that something must live on.  I don't think most of us are really capable of comprehending what happens when we die, everything stops, and we cease to be.  Along comes religion with an aha for you!

I was getting bored with SA and wanted to be a tank, so I decided to try out Gunlance and that change of pace was definitely troublesome to get used to, but now I pretty much switch to that GL set for slower / harder-hitting monsters, and use my faster moving SA set for monsters such as the Zinogre or Narcaguca. 



Long story short, it just takes patience and practice. Go to the Moga Woods at any time of day and practice whatever weapon you're interested in on the various monsters.

My bad health choices don't manifest in my weight, and I think I kinda lost what I was trying to get at here, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that I know how hard it can be to change your habits (especially with things you love, like junk food and cigarettes, that become so easily engrained in our reward pathways), so...

Nope! Not in the slightest.

&gt; Yes, i am confident, yes i love sports. But...... Still...

If you're all of these non-loser things, why would it make you a loser? All it means to be submissive, is that you prefer someone of your choosing to make the final call on stuff. That kind of delegation can be pretty liberating! It's not weird, or weak, or spineless, or anything else bad.

You have REALLY got to stop reading these bullshit articles like they're fact. Some men ENJOY being called losers, and these articles and that porn is *fantasy to arouse them.* Don't take it as scientific knowledge. It's smut. It's hot. It's not real. Some men *enjoy* being called grovelling lowly worms/worthless pigs - they don't believe it, it's just bullshit to get their dicks hard.

So when you read articles like that - it's a pro domme playing a role. It's fantasy. Sexy fantasy. Other subs might want to be mothered or treated like babies, or go for pain play and talk to each other like normal human beings goofing off having fun.

The resources you are using to learn about BDSM are not rooted in reality. At all. It's like watching The Simpsons and assuming it's a documentary on American life. Go. Join. Fetlife. Talk to real people in real D/s relationships that love and value each other."

You might need a few packs for long hair though and if you don't trust home bleaching then definitely go to a salon. I got my mum to do mine for me.  
Don't worry lots about toning it if it's quite yellow. The lilac dye tones your hair anyway.  
To make it lilac I use L'Oreal Feria lilac conditioner. Boots and superdrug sell it in their hair dye section. It also comes in pink and champagne colour. They say they're especially for pastel tones on bleached hair. What's great about it is that you can use the whole bottle (or 2) the same way you'd use hair dye to get an even and vibrant color first time but after that you can buy it and use it as you would a conditioner in the shower. I go through a bottle in a week or 2 (I wash my hair every day) and just use it like a normal conditioner. In the picture here I'd mixed the lilac and the pink conditioners together :)

But the truth is, you don't love *him*... You love the nice little mask he put up in the beginning, the one to get you hooked, the one that fooled you into believing that this was a decent person. 

For his part, maybe he did care about you, or thinks he does, but the truth is, this person is so emotionally immature, I doubt that he is even capable of caring about himself at this point, let alone another person. 

So you need to let it go. Let him go. Accept and acknowledge that you were really and truly in love... with someone who didn't really exist. But also accept and acknowledge that *none of it was your fault*... It was all his. *He* was the one that put up the false front. 

And you are absolutely allowed to love and mourn the lie he presented, so long as you remember who he *really* is, and don't make the mistake again. 

See, the thing about people, online or not, long distance or not, is that they rarely are exactly as we perceive them to be. A small discrepancy, a small self-deception, (say, looking over the fact that your S.O. likes watching bloody violent sports or eats meat when you think those sports are abhorrent or eating meat is morally wrong) isn't so bad and is even healthy for a relationship, but when the discrepancy between who we think they are and who they actually are is great enough and people are getting *hurt* by those discrepancies, it is ultimately time to confront the truth.

That was a Friday night. We texted all weekend and then decided to hang out in the city after work/uni on Monday. We were awkward for an hour or so and then just before my bus came he kissed me. That's what I really consider our first kiss. We were basically inseparable from that point.

It's at the point now where we have to send ours out on loan to keep them fresh, but when they get back they go into the reserves anyway. The only young player getting a chance atm is Haidara because Santon always comes off after 70 mins these days."

The reason I love it is because it makes me feel really close and connected to my boyfriend and I do really like it when he fucks me hard and good, but I think other people have a very different experience. I've been on the pill since the first time I had sex and I don't really know if it influenced me (although I think not), but you're saying you're horny all the time now since you quit the pill, assuming you weren't like that before you started the pill.

Tribute.

Long time ago me and my account tugabros here

We was hitchiking down a long and lonesome thread

All of a sudden

There shined a shiny badgunsmith

In the middle of the road

AND HE SAID:

Make the best comment in the world

Or I'll eat your soul!

Well me and tugabros

We looked at each other

And we each said:

OK

And wrote the first thing that came to our heads

Just so happened to be

The best comment in the world

It was the best comment in the world

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see

One and one makes two, two and one makes three

It was destiny...

Once every hundred-thousand years or so,

When upvotes doth shine and downvotes doth glow

and karma doth grow, ooh...

Needless to say

badgunsmith was stunned.

A whip-crack from his whippet tail

And the smith was done...

He asked us: (oink) be you admins?

And we said: NAY. We are but MEN!

ROCK.

we have a saudi personnel who gets double the pay of a expat doing the same labor job. Also we still have the issue of some jobs being taking up by Saudis that the employer just sits them at home just to meet the MoL's saudi employment recommendation. 

of course this has to be taken care of first since the large majority of the saudi work force are currently are in low paying jobs.

UlgraTheTerrible,wemetonline,1389442573.0,"Being somewhat experienced with more forms of abuse than I'd like, let me just say here and now that emotional abuse is *the most* insidious form. 

It's usually *not* deliberate, up to a point. It's easy to excuse. It's harder to acknowledge. *You doubt your own sanity*... 

My abusive relationship started with emotional abuse. It's been very helpful for my recovery to deconstruct everything I remember, to pinpoint what I did wrong... And make no mistake, I did do some things wrong, there are always two sides... But my mistake was excusing shitty behavior. My mistake was doubting myself. My mistake was ultimately as simple as ignoring my gut. When it comes to who did wrong, the majority of the blame lies on him, but if I don't acknowledge the mistakes *I* made, I just set myself up to make them again and again... 

It's taken a few shitty and more or less (as if there were a distinction or degree of horrible) abusive relationships to really start recognizing the patterns, and a lot of time to differentiate between what's a reasonable personality quirk to accept and what is unacceptable, but I feel like I'm much closer these days. 

See, there's a reason there's a *cycle* of abuse. When that's what you see modeled as a kid, it is *really hard* to wrap your mind around healthy relationships... Especially because even the healthiest relationships tend to have some imbalances here and there, where someone occasionally makes an accidentally hurtful remark, or yells during a fight, etc. 

But when you start frequently thinking, ""Well, at least he doesn't hit me."" that is a flashing neon ""Get Out Now"" sign. "
LolaRuns,Games,1389442581.0,"&gt;Because ""that issue"" doesn't manifest in the game, and being based on ""real experiences"" does not mean a story is worth telling, let alone GOTY status.

If it's personal to you, of course you (the dev) think it's worth telling. Whether it is GOTY, I agree it's debatable. 

&gt;None of the issues the girls face are unique to gay teenagers. 

Of course not. But if you are lbgt (like presumably some of the devs are) then it still matters that it's gay teenagers and not any teenagers. And the alternative theory I'm suggesting that that might be the reason why they went with it (same reason why they probably went with a 90s setting, because that's what fit with their personal bio). 

&gt;The outrageousness of their relationship has as much to do with the disrespectful manic-pixie-girl nature of Lonnie as with anything else. I

Oh, I fully I agree. I just happen to think that a choice like that makes a lot *more* sense if you are coming from a personal wish fullfillment place. (Occam's Razor)

&gt;That's why this is not an exciting game for me, and why I feel it was massively overhyped. 

Being overhyped does not equal ""the devs were intentionally duplicious (as opposed to: that's what they believe in their personal life as well) in their choice of subject matter in order to make it overhyped"". What specific reason do you have to believe that they went with that topic for insidious reasons (as opposed to the reasons why Jonathan Blow or the devs of Rain or Passage or Papo &amp; Yo went with their topics) other than that you find the topic/theme/game/presentation/publicity unsympathetic?  

IMO it's totally understanable for a dev to make a story about personal cheesy teenage wish fullfillment (and even hoping to find acceptance with that). It's a while different matter whether something like that should be hyped and praised. =&gt; though it should be noted that probably a lot of games feature some very straight forward/basic/cheesy wishfullfillment as their core theme (such as any game that features some sort of ""you are the special/chosen one"" story). 

Bottom Line: 

""The Devs put the topic in only because the topic is hip"" 

is not the same as 

""The critics only praised the game because the topic is hip""

If a person who is naturally pretentious in real life makes a game about a pretentious topic he/she is not being duplicious, they are just ""write what you know/what you care about"" (it will very likely still be crap, but that's a different subject matter). If an EA exec who doesn't care about pretentious topics orders a game about a pretentious topic because they read that that is what's hip right now, that is duplicious because they don't actually care about pretentious stuff.

phaqueue,WoWGoldMaking,1389442728.0,"Was browsing and just saw this post (even though it's a little old)

Some things you can get into to make gold...

I'm finding inscription is making me plenty of gold (depends on your server of course) but I'm buying herbs VERY cheap in some cases (bought a TON of Green Tea Leaf for like 25s apiece this morning) and I'm selling 2-3k worth of glyphs in a day... 

To note with this - I just leveled inscription a couple weeks ago on this server, so I don't have all the patterns yet

I'm also selling the shoulder enchants, even at 100g per, I'm making some easy gold off those. 

Enchanting is another good choice since it basically farms for itself - especially since as a DK you can solo anything you would need to level if you're more inclined to farm instead of buying the mats (not sure what your starting capital is)

I don't really even do enchants that much - but scanning the AH with TSM's disenchant search makes me plenty of gold, as well as using Abyssal Shatter and buying cheap MoP Epics and disenchanting them into Sha Crystals (you'd be surprised how many people post MoP Epics cheaper than the price of a sha crystal...)

Check out the transmog market on your server (use theunderminejournal as a good way to find deals) you can find some goos stuff like this...  (on one of my servers, I bought the warlock green fire book for 1k and resold for 8k - that TUJ deals page!)

Transmog you can also pick up while soloing for enchanting mats if you decide to go that route - a lot of the old school raids have transmog stuff that sells really well, and you can just DE the rest...

Also - check the prices of pets on both sides (again TUJ is really good for this). Even on the same server, they can be vastly different between horde and alliance and you can move them back and forth pretty easily (I've made a TON on a 2nd server doing this - like 20k in a couple weeks so far)

You can make gold buying low and selling high on the levelling/twink item market - people pay well for levelling greens from the next xpac (more powerful at lower level? yes please)

Also look for the ""bottlenecks"" in leveling materials for professions. Goldthorn is a great example, it's needed for leveling alchemy and on my server (high pop) they sell for upwards of 40-50g each (not stack...

Mongoosen42,vegan,1389444596.0,"5% is the percentage of calories as protein contained in human milk, and infants theoretically have the highest protein requirements because they are growing the fastest. That's where I got that number from.

But I did some research, and according to the World Health organization it's a bit higher. [On page 125 of this report](http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/nutrientrequirements/WHO_TRS_935/en/index.html) they list the average protein needs of a given individual as .66g protein per 1kg of body weight, and go on to say that .87g protein per 1kg of body weight will cover the needs of 97.5% of people. So, using myself as an example, at a bit over 60kg, that means that to go with their safer high estimate I need about 50g of protein a day. 1 gram of protein has 4 calories, that's 200 calories a day from protein, or 10% of a 2000 calorie/day diet, (although with my level of activity I need more like 2500 calories a day,  so 50g of protein would be about 8% of my diet. Either way, you are right that 5% was a bit of a low estimate. My information I think came from an older WHO report that has since been updated, so I do stand corrected."

AnotherCrazyOne,vegetarian,1389444848.0,"I think one of the most important points that can be made about this discussion is that most of America which is mostly omnivorous in general doesn't get enough Omega 3 fatty acids in their diet. The standard American diet consists of 1 Omega FA 3 to 3 Omega 6 FA, and it's usually bad Omega 6 FA that we ingest rather than good. This needs to flip to 3 Omega 3 FA and 1 Omega 6 FA, and it needs to be good Omega 6 FA. When I was a nutrition counselor at a nutrition store, I used to get all kinds of arguments and statements of fear regarding taking too much of this, too many combinations of nutrients, etc. Unfortunately, their arguments were not well reasoned. I'd get, ""Is it okay to take this much of so and so?"" Well, was it okay to eat at Jack In The Box, drink as much as you did last night, etc.? Did you ask yourself that before you did all that?

So if one is not a vegan or vegetarian, there's a good chance you're not getting enough Omega 3 fatty acids in your diet. The standard American diet is far more of an issue regarding health risks than being a vegetarian. If someone is vegetarian, it's likely they pay more attention to their diet than most Americans do, so they're more likely to be healthy...less obesity, less heart disease, less diabetes, etc."

LolaRuns,Games,1389445296.0,"I think one core problem is that the ending seems to clash with the overall atmosphere of the game. The game tries to be extremely realistic (no monsters, no fighting, no supernatural stuff) but this kind of ""and they ran off together and lived happily ever after"" ending would actually fit way better into a whismical fantasy setting ala ""and then they defeated the evil blob monster and rode off into the sunset on their sparkling pink unicorn"". (and questions like ""but how compatible are they really"" or ""what are the chances that they'll be able to build a lasting relationship/still be a couple 10 years from now considering that they are just teenagers"" don't matter because it's a fairy tale)

Personally, I don't think it's regrettable that it didn't have Sam kill herself (and honestly, would that have made the game less ""on the nose"" or ""now you go and feel bad about evil homophobes!""? I would argue it would have made the game worse/even dumber on a pure story level). But if we look at the game realistically, by its own mostly realistic standards, how would the story genuinely end? Realistically Sam would probably have called her sister 3 days later and begged her to pick her up, because she and the girlfriend have been fighting constantly and been at each others throats because of them not having any money and not finding any jobs. And then the sister would have picked her up, maybe hugged her in the car with some sort ""what you did was stupid, but I'm glad that at least you didn't kill yourself, idiot"" message. But if that is the realistic future for Sam, it seems kinda off for the game to end it where it ends. 

Storywise it probably relies too much on banking on the player's expectations, something that is always tricky unless you have a ""wow, the story got even deeper after I rewatched it after knowing the twist"" framework you are building on. 

And because of the rather unrealistic ending and the way the story is weighed heavily towards Sam it doesn't work as one of those ""unflinching look at a family"" kind of setups either. (again even if that had been the case it's debatable how praiseworthy that would have been but at least it would have been a structure that is familiar to people from movies for example)"

If you need week(s) 0, the sad news is there's no app and you probably need a stopwatch, but start with 15 seconds jogging and 60 seconds walking, for 10 repetitions. (3 times a week). 

The next week, do 30 seconds jog and 90 seconds walk, again 10 reps.

Personally, most of the time I don't mind The Swap where gender really is mostly just a symbol on your character sheet and the way your character looks. I feel like for most typical gaming narratives that is indeed enough (+ characters addressing them with the proper word aka Sir/Ma'am). I really don't need special responses or different stats because imo more times than not they can only be based off some cringeworthy generalizing assumption. 

Aka if I want to play character with high charisma and seduction skills, let me, but don't force me into it. 

(that said, I'm ok with some games that give you a (surmountable) penalty on interaction for being female to account for realism, like Crusader Kings 2, but anything that goes along the lines of ""well women get stuff cheaper!"" just makes me want to bang my head against the wall =&gt; what if I wanted to roleplay her as a ugly troll or as somebody who is very standoffish and would never take a discount cuz morals?)"

Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389450746.0,"There may be a correlation, but I'm not sure of a causal link. It's probably something more like, kosher rules disallow pork, and many pork products are heavily processed and salted (think sausage, hot dogs and bacon), therefore containing things that are bad for you. Also, depending on which circle of rabbis is keeping tabs on the production, some kosher meat may come from animals that are treated better and have less risk of illness. For example, animal contact with fecal matter is a big no-no that you wouldn't find on a kosher farm but you *would* see at a big industrial farm in China or something.

A better rule of thumb to follow is to get unprocessed meat - steaks, chicken breasts, and pork chops straight from the butcher section - rather than things like frozen nuggets or pre-cooked bacon. Prepare the food yourself, eat lots of veggies and whole grains, and don't add too much salt, and you'll be ahead of the game."

Also, by this time I had almost a C cup and my mom thought it was okay for me to wear those ""built in bra"" cami's that offer you no support.  So there were a lot of **[fashion mishaps.](http://i.imgur.com/cp4CFfk.jpg)**  This was all pre-braces so you can see how jacked my teeth were.

**Here are the braces years:**

* I have no idea what's going on with my look here but it's **[not a good one](http://i.imgur.com/0YB68ZC.jpg)**
* This is when I only wore vans shoes and thought I was **[alternative](http://i.imgur.com/8U0XUka.jpg)**
* I had figured out how to look happy but **[HOLY FUCK LOOK AT THESE EYEBROWS](http://i.imgur.com/3RI1Zl1.jpg)**
* I HAVE NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS LOOK.  **[Still gangly I see.](http://i.imgur.com/m8QG6Ks.jpg)**

But I'm really attractive now so don't worry about it.  If you happen to know me IRL I'm sorry I had to remind you of my hideous teenage years."

junkeee999,RedditForGrownups,1389452833.0,"Meh, I'm 52. Seen many waves of 'classic' everything. The term 'classic' in a commercial sense, musical or otherwise gets slapped on things approximately 20 years old. 

It makes sense when you think about it. The formative years of what will later be the good old days is 15-20. You are emerging from childhood to adulthood. Discovering sexuality and all sorts of things. 

The culture of that time is forever locked into your brain. Lots of tiny triggers. And guess what? 20 years later, those people are now 35-40, at the peak of their consumer power. Businesses understand this very well."
superspeck,texas,1389452841.0,"Ha. Huge culture shock. Tip: The guys who fly the blue Stearman on that discovery ""Reality TV"" (It's really, really scripted) show ""Airplane Repo"" are from Paris, and they are the epitome of the good ol' boys that you'll find down there. They really do talk just like that. 

My advice, as someone who went to grade school in Pittsburgh (McCandless Township) and has lived all over, is to keep your trap shut until you know what's what. I realize that this will be difficult for you, but people are going to talk about you in town even if you're just a college student, just because you're new and you have a different accent. If you get yourself a bad reputation by shooting your mouth off, you will be miserable the entire time that you are there. 

Two big red warnings: First, do NOT talk politics with strangers. If they start (and they will), just smile and nod and ask them a question that changes the topic such as if they've lived there their whole life. Second, you will be invited to church. If it is not your thing, politely decline. (Although I recommend going to a Pentecostal/full gospel/Apostolic church at least once if you're into studying culture and religion. The whole speaking in tongues thing is interesting.) 

And a third smaller warning: In southern culture, versus the yankee upbringing I had, people say things that are profoundly polite but are absolutely meaningless if you parse them the right way. This includes generic future promises of getting together. Unless someone gives you a specific time or date or task, don't expect them to follow through on something. And note that if you don't give a specific time or date, they won't expect you to follow through, and they'll be surprised or make excuses to get out of it if they do.  (""We'll have to get together sometime!"" means you probably won't, don't follow up on it. ""Let's get together for lunch next Tuesday"" means you will. ""Call me when you want to play poker"" means you should actually follow up with them.) This takes some getting used to. 

Paris is what we refer to as ""red dirt country"" Texas. The weird thing about Texas for most is that it's like multiple states glued together; D/FW and Houston are like mini Los Angeleses, West Texas is completely different, Hill Country is completely different, the coast is different, South Texas along the Rio Grande is completely different... besides the obvious differences in terrain, there are different accents, different types of country music, and different foods. I don't think that any one state has as such diverse cultures as I've found in Texas. While you're here, do try to spend some time in each culture. Also, you have to realize how big the state is. From Paris, Texas, El Paso is halfway to Los Angeles. It takes a long time to get anywhere else in the state. 

The good thing about going to college in Paris is that there isn't much to do besides go to school and drink. The bad thing about going to college in Paris is that there isn't much to do besides go to school and drink. (Yeah, even if you're underage. Like anyone hasn't.) You had better figure out how else you're going to entertain yourself, because you can't do school stuff all the time without frying your brain, and it's really easy to get frustrated and spend all your time screwing off when you're far from home and don't have all the things that have kept you disciplined in the past. Figure out how you're going to physically tire yourself out, figure out what else you want to accomplish besides coming out with a degree, and figure out what you're going to do with your brain when it's tired and doesn't want to do anything else.

Sure! They're just y'know, directly related to genitals and gender. So I don't wanna use your bathroom and keep out of my OB/GYN appointments. Other than that? People should act however they want. No one is saying everyone has to act the same. Just that how they act shouldn't be based on their genitals or anyone else's. You shouldn't feel restricted because of yours, and vice versa. Unless it's something explicitly to do with a penis, nothing should be penis-owner-only. Same goes for vaginas. Not a complex idea.

Othering is where there's us, and them. It's shitty because no, you are *not* the other. You are the default. It's not simply a separation, it's a hierarchy. You are the norm, and we are *not*. And it's shitty. You ever see anyone describe themselves as ""a guy gamer""? No? Because gamers are guys by default.. even though the numbers are actually about even.

Traits traditionally cited as feminine include gentleness, empathy, and sensitivity,[6][7][8] though traits associated with femininity vary depending on location and context, and are influenced by a variety of social and cultural factors.[9] The counterpart to femininity is masculinity.

I don't think anyone can answer that. I've worked at a supplement store for several years and I can't answer that question.

&gt; (Yes, I know it's better to always ask a Dr, but it's also not always affordable to ask a Dr.)

Save the money you would spend on stimulants for 6 months and use it to see a doctor instead.

You could try drinking a glass of green tea before exercise and see if that helps. With a high heart rate and palpitations why would you want to take this stuff without talking to a doctor about it? 

I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ioptn/iama_28_year_old_who_just_had_a_stroke/) because I know you mentioned Jack3d. 

You said the salespeople in the supplement store seemed to know what they were talking about, but when I worked at a supplement store we didn't get much more than general information about each product. I'm not necessarily anti-supplement but with known heart problems you're taking a big risk by adding stimulants.

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1389453480.0,"I always use the example of the X-Com soldiers. There is no difference between the male and the female ones except the voices and the way they look. To me, this is perfectly fine. These are professional soldiers who kill aliens. It doesn't cover any interpersonal stuff, it doesn't cover any home life. Maybe I can look at my female soldier and assume that when she goes home she hugs her kid or cries in secret while her male college maybe cracks open a bear and wanks to playboy. =&gt; but the whole point is that it this area is not covered by the game because it is not relevant. Regardless of what the soldiers do in their off time, it doesn't matter, because they all, male or female, tune that out when it comes to the job at hand, shooting aliens. In this setup it would feel forced if they tried to make any adjustments for gender (like Snipers can only be female or females get a debuff when it's around the middle of the month or whatever)

I feel even in RPGs, most problems (do I support the secret lovers or rat them out? Do I get rid of the evil Necromancer or take his bribe?) are so general or so cosmic there is zero reason why the response of a woman should be any different from a mans. To me it makes way more sense to think of this in generic terms like in general creating a high charisma path or having various paths for ""bloodthirsty""/""reasonable""/""haughty""/""peace loving""/""manipulative"". For the the number of situations I can think off where a gender locked response that is only available to men or women would make any lick of sense is so minimal (heck at the moment I can't think of any). 

I so think that men and women are reasonably different, but imo it's in the nature of a lot of game types that these areas where the differences would be most pronounced are not covered, hence diffences are unnecessary and often cringeworthy when they are done. I would say male and female behaviors are a spectrum, some men react more ""girly"" in some situations and some women act more ""manly"" in some situations. Like maybe I'm girly in 90% of all situations and yet surprisingly ungirly in 10% others. And somebody else has their 10% in completely different aspects in their life.

ConstipatedNinja,AskReddit,1389453570.0,"The first time I heard that song (mind you, I would have been 14 when it came out), I felt intensely bad for Andre 3000. I listened to a lot of dark music, but then hearing a pop song like that when I was finally starting to reach out really hit me like a ton of bricks. I realized how there were a lot of people out there who were truly, deeply, greatly sad, but held it together and still managed to make others around them happy and think that they are happy.

I mean, the song starts out with his marriage failing. He's holding on to the belief that his wife doesn't fool around while accepting the fact that she is learning to hate his guts, then it quickly flips before the first chorus to totally saying that his parents were in a loveless relationship AND that he himself is getting a divorce. At that point, the 'hey ya's are clearly him crying, but made happy-sounding.

Then verse two goes straight into talking about how even when you think that you have a wonderful relationship that it'll fall apart in the end, so why do we ever think that love is strong enough to hold people together if it's proven wrong time and time again? And then the second verse ends in pointing out that he's not happy being there at the show, and nobody else is either. Everyone involved (including him) doesn't want him there. Everyone just wants to have a moment to forget their world and dance. I swear if this didn't have such an upbeat accompaniment, this song could make people depressed from a single listen.

But the chorus comes back with his thinly veiled crying, 'hey ya.' In the back during this chorus, he's singing about one night stands. Specifically in the way of pointing out that it's not about love, just sex. It's relevant here because he's comparing one night stands to real relationships, and that the outcome is the same, but with less pain involved.

Then the bridge, one of the most quoted parts of the song, starts up. The lyrics go:

What's cooler than being cool?  
ICE COLD!

He's not actually singing about what's cool. He's talking about the ice-cold bitch that left him, and that some people believe that freezing over your heart makes you a stronger person because nothing can penetrate it. But he's sitting there, feeling the pain in his warm heart, knowing that although he is the one feeling bad now, allowing himself to feel is how he felt so good before. This is about as happy as the song gets. Except then it drifts back to one-night-stands for the rest of the bridge. He's set aside his feelings and decided that experiences may be better than love.

And he tries, he really tries to enjoy it, but he's called out to all of the ladies (particularly all of the Beyonces and Lucy Lius at the end) to dance. The same ones that he's trying to have one night stands with, but then also the ones that are just there because they're trying to forget their own world for the night. And personally, I believe that it hits him right here that he's possibly ruining relationships. These same people who are also there just to forget the world still have a world that they're going back to. Some of them are in their own relationships that are now crumbling to pieces.

And so he cries one last time, the chorus finishing the song.

Go back and watch the music video. While the main singer Andre is singing, he doesn't smile, even when he's moving around like the happiest person in the world. And during the chorus, he adds an ""OH ohh"" noise occasionally that sounds immensely like he's weeping. It's really intense.

* While Pinkie was concerned about Rarity becoming a crazy cat lady in [Suited for Success](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Suited_For_Success) (S01E14) she apparently has no problem with Goldie being one.
* Even though the reality is still unknown, Pinkie's included as an honorary Apple family member as in [The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/The_Super_Speedy_Cider_Squeezy_6000) (S02E15). (/u/silly_jimmies)

So I stopped at the stoplight and waited for it to turn green. I hear an 18-wheeler coming up behind me, then I hear the screeching of its brakes. I realized it wasn't really slowing down. At this point, I was out of options... I was going to be rear-ended into the middle of a highway at rush hour. That's it.

Luckily, the truck must've hit a dry patch because it suddenly stopped. The driver of the truck got out to make sure he didn't hit me; he missed by maybe 3 inches. I got damn lucky that day.

He based his scale on someone else's scale, which held that 0 had to be 'colder than it ever got in Denmark'. 0 was arbitrary. 

&gt;By and by Fahrenheit got ready to present his scale to London's Royal Society, the scientific big leagues of the day. It dawned on him that it was going to look a little strange having the zero on his scale just sort of hanging off the end, so to speak. So he cooked up the explanation that zero was the temperature of a mix of ice, water, and ammonium chloride.

In short, 100 means nothing at all on the Fahrenheit scale, 96 used to mean something but doesn't anymore, and 0 is colder than it ever gets in Denmark. Brilliant.

Because it's not a perspective thing, it's a fact of life in the patriarchal world we live in. I can perspective-away the fact that you *are* the default gender.

&gt;  All actors were men, then women entered the profession and got their own title, then much later women said ""why do we have our own frufru title?"" and demanded to be called actors. 

Uhhhh. You mean only men were ALLOWED to be actors, and then they allowed us as long as we were separate from y'all, and only recently have we used the gender neutral term whatsoever? That's kiiiiind of indicative of my entire point. It's not that we didn't want to act. It's not that we wanted to be different, we just weren't allowed to be the same.

&gt;  ""Girl gamers"" only came into existence because women wanted to be gamers but also be recognized as different.

Yeah no, this is hilarious bullshit too.

&gt; Carl finally stood up and shouted ""My sister is better because she's an acTRESS and that has more letters!"" and then stomped out of the room.

Cute meaningless anecdote. The cool thing about anecdotes is that they're not data.

The fact that our experiences are based on our genitals even when they're not relevant, is shitty. You're not as aware of that because you have the genitalia that *wins this crapfest.* You get the long end of the stick. Of *course* you don't think there's a problem.

&gt; None of it really makes any difference. I mean seriously, get over it. It's the past, it doesn't change. 500 years from now its still going to be just as true as it is today.

All of that geography/cartography crap presupposes two things: 1. you want your world to be realistic 2. you want the maps of your world to be realistic 3. you need to waste a few hours drawing a map that could be spent writing.

I'm 200 pages into a WIP right now on a world I built from scratch. Still haven't drawn a map.

But you write 'history' like it's equal to 'cartography,' and that's just.... oi. It's mindboggling.

I refuse to acknowledge a 'recommended reading' list because inevitably it will fuel one person's sense of worldbuilding and not others, and representing worldbuilding that way is not correct and may exclude some people.

EDIT: This is not a rant about the map people. You all keep doing your thing. But a 'recommended reading' will end up representing *you* first and foremost and not all the rest of us. Inspiration for fantastic elements is more than can be represented in simple guides, and we can't ask people to read dozens of novels and comics and play videogames. And by 'recommending' reading, we're representing that this is the *correct* way to think of worldbuilding. And we also compel people to understand all this nonsense we recommend, when none of it is *needed,* and only preferable for some people with some ideas."

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1389455143.0,"But why not just offer all dialog options for both male and female characters and just have the player choose what sounds the most right to them for their character? Aka maybe I want to rp my female as somebody who grew up in a house full of brothers, has a low brow sense of humor and who would since then totally be telling a ""Your Mom"" joke? Yes, most women probably wouldn't tell a your mom joke in this situation, by for the maybe 5% who would, why arbitrarily barr them from having that option? 

Same for your suggestion about female nobles vs. male nobles. Wouldn't that be much, much better covered by just having a pool of traits like ""heavy carrier"" or ""master diplomat"" and ""master fencer"" and then let people choose freely from that pool, rather than *forcing* people who play female characters to go with master diplomant and *forcing* people who play male characters to choose ""master fencer""? And it's up to your RP-ing prowess to pick the traits which you think would make the most sense for the character you are building with the kind of background you envisioned for them? 

Now I get that in reality there are limits to this system particularly a dialog system because you don't want to be scrolling through a gazillion of options till you find the right one. But even then, it seems to me in most cases just having an option for commanding and one option for more calm and letting people pick which one they like seems more sensible to me than having the dialog option only appear for one type of PC. 

(now again, this is for RPGs where I think roleplaying freedom should be among the highest priorities. Things are of course different for let's say fixed character action games where it's not up to your choice, but it's ""Lara"" or ""Kratos"" or ""Dante"", aka specific people with specific genders and specific fixed interests)"

When your resume doesn't do a lot to help you stand out, you're going to need to think about shifting your strategy. 

Applying to thousands of openings is a numbers game, especially in this still-sluggish economy. Of course, you've got to have an online search component, but if your entire search strategy consists of bombing out applications, that's perhaps the least effective way of getting hired short of being a superstar.

You might need to consider adding more networking into your search strategy. Connecting, with friends, family, alumni, people at the gym, whatever, who could get to know you and understand your value is more than what is seen on a piece of paper.

Can you tell me if you've been doing anything like this, and if so, how it has worked (or not)?

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1389456181.0,"Well, they could always crowdsource, ""aka so many people of your gender went with option A"" XD 

I forgot to mention, something like your Drow example or even the Qunari in Dragon Age, aka where the race itself has very gendered attitudes are kind of a different thing, whether playing as them or them reacting to you. 

Still, I feel that in many situations I think one shouldn't underestimate the kind of storytelling that goes on in a players head. Aka you can provide the same dialog option, but it means something very different depending on whether the player character is male or female. Aka let's say you play Drow and the character is given a dialog line along the lines of ""I think the members of the opposite gender are scum"" =&gt; for a female PC saying this would be roughly the equivalent of saying ""Pass me the salt"", for a male PC this would basically be sacrilege, but again, this ideally should be going through the player's head and it should make them choose the dialog option in different circumstances. 

Anyway, what I mean to say is that a lot of the time The Swap does not bother me because I think in a lot of games differences really are unnecessary due to the topic/scope of the game, aka just having generic forceful vs. diplomatic options are sufficient. That doesn't mean that I can't be flavorful, like in cases where you maybe play as a race with obscure customs like Drow or Qunari. 

BTW, Expeditions: Conquistadors is pretty interesting game that tried to have a lot of different dialog options for male and female (personally, I thought it came across as well meaning but still pretty cringeworthy). It's basically X-Com with you managing a squad as you complete quests and explore the jungle, except your leader character actually has a personality. "

I needed an operation as a baby to prevent me from puking all my food out again. So, for me, if you go back more then 50-ish years, the answer will always be that I very much prefer life as it is. "

mludd,funny,1389456285.0,"I'd like to extend this and say that I think some people assume that what they consider a comfortable walking speed is somehow the ""default"" speed at which to walk for everyone.

Of course, they fail to factor in that they're a 78-year-old woman with a prosthetic hip who needs a walker to even be able to stand up and I'm a 31-year-old 6'4"" fit male so I'm not actually putting any effort into walking this fast, I am in fact walking slower than usual and yet I have to slow down to half that speed when stuck behind her…

And for some reason these people always seem to not quite know where they're going so instead of walking in a straight line or at least following some path that's predictable they'll randomly stop or turn without warning."

KenuR,Cynicalbrit,1389456315.0,"More like an assassinate, except you have to wait one turn to make it active. A corruption always uses one turn, while a patient assassin can be played earlier and then be used at any point to instantly kill a minion. So, it's a corruption if it's in your hand and you want to kill a minion that's on the board right now, and an assassinate after you place it for any minions your opponent may play in the future. It also can't go through taunt, but that's not a huge detriment.

watermelonpaws,AdviceAnimals,1389456534.0,"I'm going to have to tell you that's a bad move. You're still looking for her validation, no matter what you want to do with it. Only this time, it's not mixed with love and concern, it's mixed with hatred.

Your self-worth is not linked with her. Just because this one woman hurt you doesn't mean that other women will do the same.

Moving on and letting bygones be bygones doesn't mean you're weak at all. It means that you have the strength to get through the heartbreak and build a braver heart for someone else who deserves it.

The truly weak action would be revenge. I know it hurts, and I've been there, but the moment where you decide revenge is the best option is the moment you hate yourself the most.

It's really easy when you're feeling like crap to take it out on someone else and then blame them, but they're not the ones who are responsible for picking up the pieces. You are.

It's fine to be angry, and it's fine to be sad. It's fine to acknowledge that it really hurts, and that you feel weak and emotionally distraught and that you're not at your best. In fact, it is best to acknowledge these emotions because they control you more than you think. But these emotions do not define you. These emotions are perfectly rational responses to the situation.

Our culture often teaches men that it's not okay to feel anything but stoicism, righteous anger, and frustration. But I can tell that you feel a lot more than that, and that it's eating you up inside. If you need someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM."

theCaitiff,AskMen,1389456859.0,"For most men, sex is a big thing and relationships need it to survive. For most men, sex is the conduit they use to achieve intimacy. The false culture of ""Real Men"" has twisted us not to show or experience emotions, so only in the throws of passion can they experience love or other ""weak"" emotions. It really all comes down to fear.

Intimacy scares them so sex is just a substitute. They've learned, like everyone else, that the people who can hurt you the most are the ones you let inside, so they stop letting people in. They only lower their emotional shields for a few moments in the height of passion, then slam them right back up as soon as the afterglow fades a bit.

I'm polyamorous and live some amazing people. As a tribe, we have rejected this false culture of fear. We are trying to get beyond it, but it isn't easy. Loving someone and letting them know it does allow them some power over you, this is true, but if they are good people your love gives you a bit of power over them too. It's a very strange two way street that until you get over the fear that they'll hurt you, you can't really see.

I'm a bit different personally. I need intimacy in my relationships. I want to have my soul utterly bare and naked before my partners, have them see me for all of my strengths and weaknesses, judge me, and accept me. I want to do the same for them. I want to mix our souls together until it is hard to see where I end and she begins. Ironically, if you've got a partner on the same page, it's easier to do that without sex. 

One of my two wives is damn near asexual. We only have sex once or twice a year at most, but we have regular date nights for quiet talking, holding, cuddling and the like. Another of my girlfriends is a victim of some really fucked up sexual violence, we've never had sex and might never, but again we find ways to be intimate and share each other without the need for sex. 

Sex is wonderful, and I enjoy the hell out of it, but many people use it as a crutch."

It seems like you want us to answer both your existential questions about meaning and beauty, and a whole set of history, sociology, and psychology questions on when and why makeup is used. That's a bit beyond the scope of this sub.

But to get a at a bit of it: Makeup is worthwhile in that it (ideally) makes the wearer feel more confident. It can be a sort of social armor. There are also studies showing that women are regarded as more professional while wearing makeup. So the standard of makeup is pretty entrenched in society and that is probably a big part of why specific types of makeup persist.

Makeup is also pretty worthless in an intrinsic sense, but so is pretty much everything if you look at it from that perspective. What's kinda interesting is that you've focused in on an almost exclusively female past-time, rather than asking why for example, sports, or expensive cars exist and persist in our culture."

Last year was a shitty year (breakup, depression, suicidal thoughts, et cetera), but this year is going to be great.

I now have a goal, a reason to live, as simple as it sounds. Yes, I did have something to do with my life, but it just wasn't enough to keep me motivated.. and alive. I'm working toward that goal, and the other goals that are included in the big one. It's occupying my mind, so I don't always fall back and think about *her*.

This goal represents a lot for me. It represents things I've always wanted to do and accomplish. Accomplishing that goal is a big step in becoming the person I've always wanted to be.

I would really recommend this to anyone who just doesn't know what to do with their life anymore. Find something you really want to do and work toward that goal. Even if it's a long-term goal, there are probably some small goals you need to accomplish in order to get to your goal. Do that.

Also, it's nice to share your goal with people around you so they keep reminding you of it. That way it doesn't get lost because you just dropped it. I'm a lazy person, so that helps a lot. People are asking how it's going and where I'm at; they push me in the right direction.

It takes about 10 minutes to bleach out my hair because not only is it light colored it's pretty fine, vs someone with dark coarse hair where it can take up to an hour before it gets light enough to dye a fun rainbow color. 

If you constantly change colors then you constantly have to rebleach, but if you keep the same color you can just re dye."

behindtimes,truegaming,1389459185.0,"As other people stated, not necessarily behind.  But as for the hardcore market, that would be the N64 era.  They've always been a family oriented console maker in the west.  While on the Genesis, games would include blood, the SNES had the games heavily censored.  Now, when the PlayStation came around, that's where the market started to diverge and more adults drift towards the PSX.

Around the time the PSX was introduced, you already had a generation of gamers now in their late teens, early 20's, who grew up with gaming.  Sony took advantage of this and started marketing more adult games.  Nintendo on the other hand kept their consoles youth oriented.  To me, this is readily apparent, as when I view reddit, I see plenty of nostalgia posts about the N64 and their childhood, yet I was in college around the time that came out, and I knew a total of two people who had an N64.  Yet I knew plenty of people who had a PlayStation.

The N64 also suffered from being cartridge based, whereas companies were starting to push FMV heavily in games, which just couldn't be done to any great extent on cartridges.  Also, cartridges tended to be significantly more expensive, alienating many 3rd parties.  The PlayStation also had a year lead on the N64 too.  So naturally, who would companies target?  A console with a larger untapped audience (adults) where you could have your game closer to your artistic intent at a cheaper cost, or a more expensive console with a smaller audience, and your games would go through heavier certification (and your game most likely censored)?

Finally, you also need to remember that during the NES era, Nintendo had a very non competitive clause which prevented any publisher from releasing games on another console if they wanted to develop for the NES.  This was overturned after a lawsuit though which helped bring about competition and start the end of the Nintendo or Nothing Days."

Our minds and bodies adapt to environments, and when we smoke in the same spot day after day our brains can predict what will happen in that familiar environment and compensate for it. What I mean is, your brain recognizes this is a smoking environment and prepares your body for the high. As a result you have to smoke more to over-come this adaptation, but instead of doing that get out and explore.

I always accompany my smoking with some physical activity, in the winter I go cross-country skiing/snow-shoeing with my dogs and MFLB. In the summer we go kayaking, hiking, jogging, or just explore cool spots.

Each time is a new stimulus (for the most part) and as a result I notice I don't need as much. But for my bed-time tokes, I need a bit more. (It helps my insomnia)

But it it's possible I always recommend a t-break to my frients. Or for a quick fix, eating mangoes an hour before partaking can increase/extend the euphoria phase, but I always recommend t-breaks: nothing revamps the old feels like a good t-break.

In mechanics problem, you set up the Lagrangian which is the kinetic energy minus the potential energy. There are so many problems you can set up. After you solve the Euler-Lagrange equations, the question often pops up: ""find the frequency of small oscillations.""

To do this, one method is to first find the critical angle about which the system oscillates. And then taylor expand the function around this critical angle. I.e. instead of a lagrangian as a function of theta L(θ), you do L(θ - θ_0), where θ_0 is the critical angle. Since it's small oscillations, θ - θ_0 is a very small quantity, so taylor expanding is a valid tool.

****

Alternatively, you can use it for number crunching. I don't like memorizing results like sqrt(3), etc. Unfortunately, I needed to know them fort he Physics GRE. I figured, hey, you know what, why don't I just taylor expand it?

I'm familiar with the expansion sqrt(1 - x) ~ 1 - x/2. So if I rewrite sqrt(3) in a more suggestive form, I can compute it explicitly by hand.

sqrt(3) = sqrt(4 - 1) = 2sqrt(1 - 1/4) ~ 2(1 - 1/8) = 7/4 = 1.75. This is pretty close to the actual result.

This is good if you're too lazy to find a calculator. Or if you want to impress your friends. "

lascalaveras,NoStupidQuestions,1389459845.0,"Are you in the US?

I've heard people whose employment has ended this way.  

I suspect it's a way to fire someone informally so that if the employee applies for  unemployment benefits the employer can contest the claim and say the employee has not been fired, just not scheduled. (I understand the employer has to pay more unemployment insurance if someone claims the benefit)

It may also decrease the amount of unemployment benefits for which you quality - which I think are calculated based on your average weekly wage during your employment.  (the weeks with no hours would drag down that average, of course).

I'm not sure of any of this, but maybe others know better how unemployment benefits work.  I've never had it myself, but have heard others dealing with it.

I would suggest talking to a manager and if they don't start scheduling you, apply for unemployment benefits asap. Maybe when you apply you can get some kind of case worker or consultation or at least see if your employer will deny that you've been fired?

I did help a guy that scared the shit out of me one night though.  Working late and the last to leave I get to my car in a dark empty parking lot.  As I start it a minivan comes speeding in and parks beside me as the driver jumps out in what I would call a panic.

He put his hands up I assume to seem nonthreatening so I rolled down my window ready to hear a garbage story about needing a handout.  Him and his wife were a good distance from home and had several hours to go trying to get to their daughter for the birth of a grandchild.  His wallet was stolen at a rest area and anything I had to offer would help.

The sincerity in his eyes and tone of his voice were heartbreaking.  I had $40 cash on me and handed it to him expecting no more than a thank you when he slid open the side door and handed me a case of redbull and a few 12 packs of mtn dew they had stocked up on before leaving home."

creepmouse,schizophrenia,1389460571.0,"These are all abstracts, but I'm guessing you have read each study completely. I can't access them on a mobile. How many people did they use in their tests? For how long? Long term? And they all are concerned with specifically the cannabis you've mentioned? 

Edit: I did read them. 

The last study for example, is for acute sz and schizophreniform symptoms, given to less than 100 hospital inpatients for 28 days and it's less than a year old. They were also not smoking it, and in the discussion it states that the use of the cannibidol is a possible complementary or alternative mechanism for the inhibitors they were specifically testing. It warrants further study.

I won't dismiss it for complementary assistance for SOME people, but certainly not all. It seems like the studies encourage further research but have come to no hard and fast conclusion. Perhaps this is why a doctor won't recommend it. The risks for most outweigh the benefit imo.

Willravel,ainbow,1389460571.0,"&gt;But she is not. She said she wasn't thrilled. She said she was disappointed and that ""this isn't the life she wanted for me."" She said I was too young to make this choice, even though it wasn't a choice.

I can't help but think of the ""when did you choose to be straight?"" question when people say stuff like this. Granted, your mother was probably upset, so maybe she wasn't thinking clearly, but the idea that sexuality is just something you decide one day is beyond silly. I wonder how many women your mother was with before she came to the decision she was straight. I'm guessing none. 

The problem, I think, is that people don't see all sexual orientations as being the same, even though they are. Being gay doesn't follow a different set of rules than being straight, you're just attracted to a certain set of folks, like anyone. Your attraction to men is no different than your mother's attraction to men, it's hard-wired. 

In any event, I'm really sorry that she had this selfish, immature reaction. You and your boyfriend deserve to be happy and to have a chance to find yourselves a healthy, supportive environment. If your mother won't be a part of that, then it's very much *her choice* which is the problem here, if we're pointing fingers about bad choices. "

dreamingofjellyfish,AskWomen,1389460849.0,"&gt;Mentally, that our expectations have been warped by the presence of something which is not always readily identifiable/attributable.

Maybe come up with something more focused here. People are social animals, and capable of generating abstract concepts. There is no way, short of total isolation from birth (really not healthy), that someone can exist without the influence of social expectations and concepts. We are all products of our social environment. There is no essential human existence separate from culture.

&gt;Or, in that we see ourselves as somehow inadequate in the face of some element of Nature - our own or other people's opinions of us in the case of make-up, or simply battling for survival/identity in a wild world full of genuinely intimidating things in the case of tribal applications.

I feel like this is getting at the delicate balance between healthy and unhealthy social message. Cultural obsessions with some topics clearly do lead to unhealthy behavior in some people. But I'm not remotely concerned about makeup in this context. The places where this alarms me are when it leads to things like anorexia or self-harm or social anxiety. Because we are social animals, it's really hard to pick apart healthy vs unhealthy social influences because there is no baseline. We don't have any reference for an ""ideal"" healthy person without social influences because that doesn't exist. 

It's made more complicated by the mutability of culture. Currently we have a lot of debate about body image and presenting a range of healthy bodies as good rather than one type as the idea for everyone. Again because we don't exist outside culture it becomes very hard to say what the best solution here is. But basically we're never going to live in a utopia where all negative messages are erased (largely because we can't agree on what negative messages are in every case).

&gt;Physically, that everything we've invented isn't necessarily good for us, every supposed advancement isn't necessarily positive.

&gt;Man-made chemicals, pollution.... Every element of supposed normalcy that is claimed to be so without real evidence. We have no idea what it was like to be alive 100,000+ years ago

So, we don't know what exactly life was like 100K years ago. We do know which synthetic chemical and products were developed when. And the vast majority of synthetic chemical manufacturing has been in the past few hundred years. So we can look at historical records before that. Natural compounds can also be very harmful. And you're correct, we don't entirely understand these either. If you're deeply concerned about this do two things: 1) study toxicology 2) listen to toxicologists when it comes to regulating chemicals.

Saying, ""hey chemical are bad!"" is absurd. Everything is a chemical. Many synthetic compounds save lives and drastically improve people's quality of life. But there is a lack of knowledge about some compounds used in luxury items. It's possible to minimize their impact by buying knowledgeably and promoting research. It's also reasonable to expect that these compounds may have an impact, but it is not a huge, catastrophic impact. We tend to quickly identify the compounds that are serious carcinogens or teratogens because the effects are major. 

What's less understood is the compounded impacts of multiple compounds. These can be different than the simple sum of those compounds individually. Again - research. (Disclaimer, I'm going into biological research and recently took a class with some toxicology, so of course I'm gonna say we need more research - aside from being socially valuable, it's interesting and it pays my bills.)

TL/DR: We can't disconnect from society or our environment, so everything's relative.

Willravel,feminisms,1389461707.0,"I'm totally fine with kids who have an interest in fashion or fitness or makeup having toys that cater to their interests, but there are two major problems here: 

1) Boys toys and girls toys. There's an image floating around Reddit which features a simple flow chart for children's toys by gender. If the toy doesn't involve genetalia, it's for both genders. If it does, it's not appropriate for children. Little boys should feel free to have dolls and makeup and fashionable clothing, and little girls should feel free to get toy soldiers and trucks and Nerf guns. These toys don't exist for the purpose of enforcing a strict gender binary, they exist for the purpose of being played with. That's it. Pink is not a girl's color and blue is not a boy's color. Colors are for everyone. The idea that girls can and should only be interested in dolls is stupid. I had a hot pink Barbie Ferrari as a kid, and it got along just fine with my Legos and my GI Joes. 

2) One norm of shallow beauty. Look at that picture at the top of the article. Size -2, big bust, huge eyes, flawless skin, long legs, generally white, and a whole host of outfits which are clearly designed to impress. When combined with the above complaint that seemingly dolls are just for girls, and considering dolls are about idealized physical beauty, this is a recipe for the super-shallow and it's deeply damaging. I'm glad Barbie and other doll companies at least provide their dolls with implied careers, but they do it only with clothing. A lawyer is not reducible to a pencil skirt and a blazer. A researcher is not reducible to a white lab coat and cute glasses. And, as it just so happens, they're all size -2, big busted, with huge eyes, flawless skin, long legs, and generally white. "

Fluttershyhoof,TwoXChromosomes,1389461936.0,"Well hey, everyone's on the fence about something, and trans folks are somewhat of an enigma it seems. The only coverage of us is as ""shemales"" or ""trannies"" or jokes about men that look like women, or women that look like men. It's very dehumanizing and downright inaccurate! You probably see a least one or two trans people in your daily life, and have no idea. Anyways, I appreciate the questions. A desire the learn is the first step in acceptance! So kudos for that! &lt;3 Noooow, lemme tackle these questions. 

1) Well, I actually did see many therapists. I was on medications, had therapy sessions, on and on... and I had no idea that I was even trans at the time. Nothing ""pushed me"" into being trans. It's something you either are or aren't... like being gay. 

I think in order to truly answer your question, I need to dive right into the mechanics of what causes someone to be trans, and what being trans really means. 

During development in the womb, all people start out as female. That is the default state. Androgens cause someone to be male, lack of them causes someone to be female. The body develops different parts at different stages, and one of those parts is the brain. Now, if in this stage a fetus receives the proper amount of androgens, the brain develops along a male path, not enough, female path. The rest of the body is the same way. 

So here's where it gets interesting. What happens if the brain gets different hormones than the rest of the body? A fetus that is otherwise female, gets enough androgens to make the mind male (FtM)? Or maybe for some reason the brain doesn't get enough of the hormones (androgen insensitivity, mother's diet, stress, etc) and the brain is left in the default female state while the body is male (MtF)? You get trans people. (I could go into XY females and XX males, but that's better left for another time)

We are born with our minds knowing they should be connected to bodies of the opposite sex than they are. This causes dysphoria. Dysphoria is like living life through a virtual reality machine. Everything you see, feel, interact with feels fake and distant. There's no connection between the mind behind the eyes, and the body it controls. When you look into the mirror you see someone else... a stranger. You get depressed and don't know why. Can't ever seem to be happy with your body. Feel wrong in your own skin. 

Well, in my case, I had a mild form of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. That means my body did not properly absorb and use androgens. Due to that, my brain developed along a female path, while my body developed along a -very- feminine male path. Even before HRT I had hips, boobs, sparse facial hair, no super deep voice, no adams apple, etc. 

So my whole life I experienced dysphoria and had no idea what it was. Finally, by chance, after a life of always wishing, wanting, and longing to be a girl... a friend asked the question I'd always needed to hear. They asked if I was transgender. I'd never heard of this concept. I didn't know it was a thing. I looked it up and was amazed! This was the word for what I felt! I wasn't alone, I wasn't some sexually depraved freak... I was just a person with a legitimate medical condition. 

So from there I decided to see a therapist, to find out if I really was trans. I needed to be 110% sure of it. Well, I fit the textbook definition for someone who was transgender, and -that- is when I started my journey. So, now when I answer your question simply, you'll get my full meaning. What pushed me there? Everything. Life. 

Hope that was thorough enough. \^_^ ;


2) My worries were pretty standard. What if I'm wrong and I'm making a mistake? (I wasn't and didn't) What if people hate me or hurt me? (hasn't really been a problem) What will my family think? (They struggled with it, but most are okay with it and many are very supportive) What about my friends? (Every one of them was hugely supportive) What about the cost? (health insurance covers it) Will I pass? Will I pass? What if I don't pass? I hope I pass. (That repeated in my mind for months on replay, even now sometimes I get self-conscious) 

It was a very worrying process with a lot of unknowns, but it ended up working out amazingly, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. 

3) The word choice is fine. \^_^ I foresee it being a lot like being gay. It's already starting to move towards that. People come out as gay now and it's like ""eh, good for you, I love you no matter who you love"". Being gay, in most places, isn't even a thing anymore. You mention being gay, no one gets mad, treats you odd, or makes a deal of it. 

I've discovered this has started to happen with being trans. Sometimes my partner or I will have to mention our trans status, and no one cares. It's just not a big deal for a lot of people anymore. As awareness rises and trans folks become more visible and mainstream for something OTHER than being sexualized or demonized, we will simply just be. It won't be a big deal anymore. 

4) Why would it feel strange? Trans people can look good. Changing from one gender to another does not exclude one from attractiveness. Some of the hottest people I've seen are trans. Please don't take this the wrong way; Don't think about what someone is or was. We're all people. Trans folks are no different from any other person... we just have to work a little harder to be comfortable in our bodies than most. &lt;3 

I hope I answered everything well enough for ya. :D

Riguy64,lifehacks,1389462863.0,"What actually got me to control my eating was to change my mindset about food. We've got to remember that food is something you eat to survive. When you feel hungry, ask yourself whether you've already eaten enough (for example, i use this at night when I've just finished dinner an hour or two before). If you're not going to die for skipping that snack, then don't eat it. Remember: eating is for surviving. Food is fuel.

It's hard at first, but within a week, you stop getting hungry at odd times. Also, drinking water when you feel hungry, and as the video says, chewing gum, also helps

Also, this is to just stop eating extra. Please eat the required daily amount. Don't starve yourself!"

GreatOdlnsRaven,tolkienfans,1389463049.0,"I actually just wrote a paper about this for one of my classes, this is just a theory of mine solely based on the hobbit, no one other back sorry involved: I wrote that gandalf picked bilbo because of bilbos mastery of words. From one of the very first encounters bilbo says good morning to gandalf, and gandalf responds with something along the lines of is it a good morning, or are you telling me that it is a good morning, or a morning in which to be good on? Bilbo responds with all of then at once. I chose to take this as gandalf testing bilbo with his words. And of course bilbo seemed to pass with his unlikely, yet clever response. Gandalf needed an unlikely person, a person that a dragon may not know or have very little knowledge about, but this person also had to be very good at riddles, because of course, dragons love riddles. 

Tl;dr gandalf chose bilbo because hobbits are widely unknown and bilbo had an amazing mastery of words.

&gt;Before you decide to do your own research, particularly on-line, please ensure that you have a good understanding of topics such as statistics, statistical significance, experimental design, data interpretation, correlation versus causation, journal review processes, referencing, impact factors and research funding.

What this says is that you shouldn't even do research, just do as your doctor tells you, unless you're well versed on a number of subjects that aren't generally taught below the postsecondary level in North America.  

While I personally agree that it is important to understand those things in order to evaluate the research properly, and I am fortunate to have the education and experience to do so, I am also very well aware of how infrequently people are in the same position.  I am often asked my opinion on articles or studies by friends who are intelligent, well educated, and skeptical, but know I deal more with it on a regular basis and want a second opinion.  I still don't trust 100% that I'm getting the whole picture when I do my own research.  

I would never give advice like this, because it discourages the average person from being proactive.  I would encourage people to be skeptical and willing to ask their doctor's opinion on the things they find in their research, and to talk to more than one doctor if they are getting conflicting info or resistance to engage.  

The second issue I have with this post is that it is telling you that nothing but reputable publicized scientific research has any value.  We all know that isn't true, because we're on a message board asking opinions from other preggos and moms.  I recommended a few days ago that people wait to meet their baby before buying certain baby items.  I can assure you that there is absolutely no reliable basis for that suggestion, it is purely anecdotal.  You know what?  It's still true.  There is value in anecdotal evidence.  Not authority, but still value.  This again is where healthy skepticism is valuable, read my advice and decide for yourself.  But with the above post, you're being told that your experiences and advice have absolutely no value, that no one should listen to you, that you have nothing to contribute.

It is very common for scientific research to be driven by controversial subjects.  People will do studies because informal communities like ours are buzzing about this issue or that.  Our buzzing has value, our stories have value, our contribution matters.  The Medela website says that the Freestyle has stronger suction than the pump in style, the reviews all say the opposite.  Sometimes it is important to identify where the anecdotal evidence indicates that there is something wrong with the authoritative source, that is what spurs further inquiry and review.  Standard birthing practices in North America are changing, and they are doing it in large part because people like us are driving change and pushing for better science.  Don't tell anyone to stop pushing for that!

So the fact that there was controversy about this doesn't surprise me at all.  Anyone that tells you not to do your own research is giving you bad advice.  Anyone that tells you that you aren't smart enough to educate yourself on a subject, is giving you bad advice.  Half the time people are joining these communities and support groups of ours because they don't want to be at the mercy of what the doctor tells them.  That's a good thing.  

Wow this got long.

**Tl;dr - I'm not surprised it was controversial, it is condescending and devalues communities like ours.  Everyone should do their own research, just be skeptical, know the limits of your own knowledge, and follow up on what you read with other sources!**"

piggybankcowboy,IndieGaming,1389463176.0,"Provided the videos showcased the gameplay and teased the story, I think this could be successful on Steam. From my perspective, I like a really good narrative, but if the gameplay is uncomfortable or clunky, I can't get into the story no matter how engaging it is, so this is what I'm curious about with your game. The screenshots, and your other comment makes it sound like something I would like to play, though. I'd just need to see more. 

Just do me a few favors if you put it on Greenlight; no dubstep, be thorough in your description (or showing off) of gameplay mechanics, and if you have a demo or intend to have one later, link it conspicuously at the top of the description. This is where a lot of games either fail or get annoying, in my opinion. 

That, and even if you do get Greenlit, you need to consider a realistic price point. This ultimately will make or break you (edit: strictly speaking with the Steam market, I mean), given that it's also available on mobile, which people tend to think of as $1 games, even though this is clearly not always the case. I've noticed a bit of a backlash lately about mobile games coming to Steam, as well as the plethora of zombie games, which results in some unfair judgments. "

Fun fact, I just checked, Machinarium WAS made in Flash. So there you have your answer, can you make Machinarium like games in Flash? Yeah.

I'm not too familiar with Flash content pipeline, but my guess is you'd have every game screen as a separate Flash scene, place your gorgeous art, use multiple layers and stuff. On the back you'd have a big ActionScript codebase which manages all the actions, switches between scenes, triggers the animations and all.

You could either use vector graphics, or just drop vectors and use spritesheets.

scooper1030,suns,1389463536.0,"We have 4 potential picks this year:

Our own: We keep it no matter what. 

From Minnesota: Top-13 protected. Meaning that, if they have a pick in the 1-13 range, they keep it. However, they would still have to give us that pick at some point. Either in 2015 (top-12 protected), or 2016 (also top-12 protected). If they still haven't given us a first-round pick by 2016, we get their 2016 and 2017 second-round picks instead.

From Washington: Top-12 protected this year. Since they're a playoff time now, we will likely get this pick. But again, they would have to give us a pick at some point if not this year. It will simply carry over year after year, and if we still haven't gotten the pick by 2020, it becomes unprotected and we get it no matter what. 

From Indiana: Top-14 protected this year. They're a playoff team, so there's about a 99.9% chance we will get this pick this year. But just like Washington's, if for some reason it falls into the protected range it will continue to carry over year after year until eventually becoming unprotected in 2020. 

Now to 2015:

Again, we will have our own pick.

From L.A.: Top-5 protected. Unless the Lakers are terrible, we get the pick. If we don't, it's top-3 protected in 2016, top-3 protected in 2017, and finally unprotected in 2018.

eighthgear,anime,1389464607.0,"Well, that was about what I expected it would be.

And that certainly isn't bad.

When the news came out that Shaft would be doing Nisekoi, most people acted as if it was some sort of bizarre match. And, I will admit, Nisekoi is decidedly more *normal* than most Shaft adaptations. Nisekoi is no [Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2605/Sayonara_Zetsubou_Sensei) or Monogatari. Nor is it even as weird as other Shaft romcoms, like [Maria Holic](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5030/Maria†Holic), [Arakawa Under the Bridge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7647/Arakawa_Under_the_Bridge), or [Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9379/Denpa_Onna_to_Seishun_Otoko).

Reading Nisekoi, however, convinced me that it was a show that would work well if given the Shaft treatment. The manga is fast-paced (in terms of humour, not plot development), relying on quick jokes followed by reaction faces, much like Arakawa Under the Bridge. The art style is conventional, but of a high quality, since Komi Naoshi is certainly an excellent artist. Really, for those who didn't think Nisekoi was a good fit for Shaft, I would recommend reading the first few chapters of the thing.

So, on to the anime. It was beautifully animated, with Shinbō Akiyuki using his trademark style on several occasions (loved the Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei reference). However, the Shaft flair never got in the way of the story, as it sometimes does in [Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari) (I haven't seen the other Monogatari series, so I can't comment on them). It was distinct enough to be unique from the works of other studios, without being bizarre for the sake of being bizarre. No fast-flashing text interruptions here. The landscapes were ethereal throughout dramatic scenes, and simple when the focus was more on comedy. This show will undoubtably be compared to Monogatari, since most people are familiar with Shaft through that series and [Madoka Magica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka★Magica), but in many ways Nisekoi reminded me of previous Shaft works, a sort of cross between Denpa Onna and Arakawa.

The comedy was straight out of the manga, and it worked pretty well. Considering that the manga only gets more outlandish as it leaves behind the first few chapters, I have high hopes for the upcoming episodes. [Tōyama Nao](http://myanimelist.net/people/11184/Nao_Touyama) (Chitoge) and [Hanazawa Kana](http://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa) (Onodera) carried out their roles with style, as is to be expected of two excellent voice actors, and [Uchiyama Kōki](http://myanimelist.net/people/1764/) certainly did a fine job as Ichijou, considering that Ichijou is supposed to be a more ""normal"" character (as romcom leads often are). 

What was a bit surprising, I'll say, was the soundtrack. I was expecting [ClariS](http://myanimelist.net/people/11746/ClariS), but I wasn't expecting pseudo-medieval style pipes/flutes. It worked, though, especially with the reverse-Romeo and Juliet premise of the show.

So, overall, I found the first episode predictable (given that I have read the manga) yet very entertaining. I'll be interested in seeing what Shaft decides to adapt, and what they skip, as the show progresses.

psychicsword,PoliticalDiscussion,1389465099.0,"Just because people rely on it doesn't mean it is the best system possible. A lot of people rely on the fact that they can go to the ER when they are about to die without insurance but we are changing how healthcare works and just because it has historically been a positive doesn't mean that it will continue to be a positive. Right now we are seeing a real shift where it isn't as good for people anymore and they would have been better off with an investment fund and a state disability program at lower taxes. 

&gt;Retired workers and their dependents account for 70% of total benefits paid.

If I had that extra cash in a forced like 401k program then you wouldnt lose any of the benefits. 

&gt;Disabled workers and their dependents account for 19% of total benefits paid.

So make it so those are the only people covered under a lower tax rate and the rest goes into the 401k like program. 

&gt;About 91 percent of workers age 21-64 in covered employment in 2011 and their families have protection in the event of a long-term disability.

If I had my cash in a 401k program I could pass it down to both my small children and even adult children through inheritance.

&gt;Just over 1 in 4 of today’s 20 year-olds will become disabled before reaching age 67.

&gt;69% of the private sector workforce has no long-term disability insurance.

Like I said above we can make that the only part that is a covered.

&gt;Survivors of deceased workers account for about 11% of total benefits paid.

Those survivors would have received a better inheritance if they had that money invested. 

&gt;About one in eight of today’s 20 year-olds will die before reaching age 67.

This seems like a negative to me. Those people cant even control the assets they are generating. I am 24 and if I die tomorrow my parents and brothers are the beneficiaries of all my savings and the 15k I have saved for retirement. If I did with SS they get nothing because they arent considered a survivor and I achieved nothing with the 6.2% of my hard work and labor over the last 4 years. 

&gt;About 96% of persons aged 20-49 who worked in covered employment in 2011 have survivors insurance protection for their young children and the surviving spouse caring for the children.

You said this one already. 


Overall what we are suggesting is that you run a disability insurance program at a 2% tax rate or something and then you force people to take 4.2% of their paychecks and put it into a state retirement fund that works like SS now or they can take that money and invest it into a private system. This system wouldnt kill off any of the benefits that you listed above. "

EvanYork,TrueChristian,1389465398.0,"&gt;What does it mean to take the Lord's name in vain? 

It depends on who you ask. I'd just summarize it as, respect God.

&gt;Stay away from the occult right?

Eh.  It's not that big of a deal.  It's just crazy people doing crazy things.  They don't have magic powers.  You can't be involved with it - that would be involving yourself in another religion - but it's nothing to be afraid of, because it isn't real.

Part of the Christian faith is accepting that the demonic exists.  But there is nothing that mandates that we take people seriously when they make ridiculous claims.

&gt;Saving oneself for marriage, God wants me to do that? 

The vast majority of Christian denominations would say yes.

&gt;I pray to God, but how do I honor Jesus as well? I'm supposed to right? 

You can pray to Jesus too.  Images of Jesus are encouraged as devotional aids.

&gt;Do I have to pray a certain way to ask God for forgiveness for my sins? 

If you belong to a community that practices confession, go to that.  If you do not, pray and ask for forgiveness.
  Like /u/zoziw said, practice forgiving other people.
&gt;Is it possible to make God angry? 

The Bible shows God as angry at groups of people sometimes, but it doesn't really ever depict God as angry at individuals.  I would hypothesize that you alone can't make God angry.

&gt;How do I overcome feeling embarrassed when I pray?

Pray more. Fake it until you make it.

&gt;Do I have to read the Bible in order?

Nope.  Personally, I discourage it.  Too many people seem to peter out in the boring parts of things like Numbers."

The reserved version: planning for your outcome will inexorably rely on relevant parameters.


There is too much empirical evidence of many supernatural phenomena to blithely accept the ordinary Western secular realism (with its pervasive emptiness and misery.)


Not least among these, is a historical person named Jesus who healed the deaf and lame, perfected the observance of the Old Testament, and rose from the dead (according to the official records of the state which spent the next century killing his followers.)


A somewhat bolder version:  I am enthusiastic about the Bible because anyone can read it and, paying attention to their life, find that its contents are all reliable and true.  (Everyone who begins to read it finds things they don't agree with, in part because its statements are mainly so definite and not esoteric or open to mysticism *at all*.)


Moreover, the ordinary cultural attitudes in fashion today lead consistently to misery and ruin.  By reading the scriptures, I am privileged to understand what factors are at work when everyone around me tumbles predictably into the same problems.

n88888888,WritingPrompts,1389466345.0,"It started as a tapping on the window pane. A crisp, startling rattle that made little curled hairs stand up straight on his neck. The knocking was harsh and attention grabbing, as though there was an accident in the field, and a young farmhand was trying to summon his aid. It wasn’t the kind of knock an old buddy would rap, hoping the farmer would take a break from his work to grab a coffee and burger at the local diner. It was too late, and it was much too urgent. 



They came to his eardrums in triplets, consecutive until the next pairing. 



*RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP.*



His back was facing the window, where the racket was singing in the same stale pitch of old, thick glass vibrating with haste, stirring his stomach. It was late, and he worried of what accidents may have occurred while he was starting seeds in his tool barn. Perhaps a fire in the community, or a vehicle crash at a dark intersection. It could be one of the animals. He remembered a heifer that had complications giving birth last spring. When they had found her the next morning, she was as rock-hard as a statue, and her little one looked as though it had been frozen in it’s most horrific moment, trying to pry itself out of it’s mothers dead corpse. He had lost them both, but the bodies, if nothing else, kept coyotes away for a day or two.  The old farmer had his farmhands drag them to the end of the farm where the forrest began. An easy lunch from an unfortunate loss. His stomach sank lower as his thoughts shifted from probable to tragic. He imagined his old wife, strong-willed yet frail in her stature, crumpled on the ground under a load too big for her to carry. He felt his mind race and muscles clench in the half-a-second it took him to turn to face the music.



As he turned, the rapping stopped mid-melody, and darkness filled the window where a human figure should have been. It was a windy evening, so the farmer dismissed the noise as twigs banging against the building. Squinting at the window, he sighed, thinking of the tragic death of a loved one he had fabricated in his head. He turned back to his seeds, but not before feeling slightly uneasy about the situation.

Sure enough, the second his back was to the window, the tapping began.
*RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP.*

The farmer twisted around sharper than a cowboy taking a barrel turn at the stampede. The window was blank. His heart sank, and he began to feel as though there was more to blame for the tapping than just the weather. He tilted his cap up to scratch his patchy head, taking a few steps towards the window. He put his hand to the glass, and his old grey eyes to his hands. Nothing.

He turned on the heel of his rubber boots to find a *RAP-RAP-RAP* gnashing as his box pleat before he fully rotated himself. The warm fleecy lining of his flannel shirt might as well have been left on the sheep, as his blood ran so cold under his skin that goosebumps has risen like a million little mountain ranges. He didn’t turn back right away. He waited and listened, a third time, to the rattling of the window.
*RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP.*

The longer he lingered, the louder the knocking became. 
*RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP.*
He feared the window may shatter under the force of impact.
*RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RA-*

He turned. 

In the time he had taken to allow the bashing to continue, he had prepared himself for who could be on the other side. An escaped patient from the local asylum? A demon, or the Devil himself? A prankster youth from the community? A bear? An infinite amount of brainstorming while listening to the RAP-RAP-RAPing couldn’t allow him to brace himself for the figure he would see as he turned to face the direction of his frustration and curiosity.

He gasped, face to face with the last person he would have ever considered he would come face to face with. One hand landed just above his heart, the other over his gaping mouth. Never taking his eyes off of the ghastly figure, he made his way to the tool barns entrance. A few slow, sideways paces got him to the exit, and the hand on his mouth slowly made contact with the knob, shaking en route. From here, a quick sprint of adrenaline rushed through his body as he yanked open the door and jolted to the spot outside the window to confront the intruder. 

Where there was once a being, there was nothing.

He looked down at the muddy ground to see a pair of footprints embedded into the soft soil. This was all that was left of the spy at the window. Cautiously, he fit his own feet into the stencilled impressions. A perfect fit. His heart raced. 

In his rush to confront the uninvited figure, he hadn’t switched off the barn lights. Movement caught his eye and pulled his attention from the ground. Cupping his hands over his brow to get a better look, he peered into the window, forehead against the glass as the face staring back at him had been posed. The light illuminated a large, broad figure in rubber boots and an old mesh ball cap. Could it really be what he was seeing?

He raised a fist from his face, and hovered it over the window. Then, *RAP-RAP-RAP-RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP.* The figure turned, placing a hand oh his chest. Slowly, his other covered his gaping mouth and deep, wrinkled features. *RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP. RAP-RAP-RAP.* He rushed to meet the farmer outside. 

As the door violently swung open, the farmer recalled the initial face looking back at him. The man who was rapping on his window. It was more of a reflection; a mirror image of an old farmer who was a striking image of the man with his seeds. The same cap, the same features, the same clothing and boots. In the second it took for the impostor inside the building to step out to meet the farmer, the farmers body shivered, remembering the bruising on the first ghostly face he had seen. There was blood trickling from his mouth and cracks in his skin. He had a look of death that was otherwise disputable because of the physical act of knocking and the figures open eyes. The farmer lifted his forehead from the glass to meet the impostor.

The boots and flannel shirt were replaced with a long dark cloak and scythe. The night was dark.  
*RAP-RAP-RAP.*

OlderThanGif,CFL,1389467469.0,"First off, I'd go through old posts on /r/cfl from ~8-12 months ago because I remember (I can't remember precisely when) we got a *lot* of posts from new American fans asking about the game, which team to pick as their favourite, etc. If you can find some of those old posts, you might find the discussion there interesting.

So, if you don't know already, the game is considerably different. Bigger field, more players on the field, only 3 downs, unlimited motion in the backfield, kicking game is different, timing is different, etc. So if you have any questions about rules or strategy, maybe that's a different discussion :P

As far as the league goes, we have 9 teams. They're divided up into 2 divisions, the West (5 teams) and the East (4 teams). At the top of this page, you should be able to see their 9 logos arranged from west to east (BC Lions, Edmonton Eskimos, Calgary Stampeders, Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Toronto Argonauts, Ottawa REDBLACKS, Montreal Alouettes). It is a legal requirement that you yell REDBLACKS as loud as you can when pronouncing the name of the team.

The West Division is traditionally the more competitive/dominant division. However, often times there's 1 *really* good team out of the East that will win the Grey Cup or make a good attempt at it. Montreal used to have sort of a dynasty as ""the team to beat in the East"" though I would say that's now switched to Toronto in the past few years.

Ottawa is a brand new team. They just finished their expansion draft a few weeks ago. They're looking surprisingly decent on paper for an expansion team. We'll see how they do.

Saskatchewan (in the West) is the current Grey Cup champion team and the team with the most/craziest fans. Throughout their (long, almost 100-year-long) history, they have *never* been a dominant team, though. They get one good year here and there and sometimes they fuck it up and sometimes they don't, but they've never been dominant. (Lancaster/Reed era is maybe sort of an exception)

I would say Calgary and BC have been battling over the past decade as *the* dominant team in the West. Both of them are consistently very strong teams.

The other teams, they have their moments and their ups and downs. Sometimes they're on top for a few years; sometimes they're in the basement for a few years. Currently Winnipeg is the laughing stock of the league. Not going to lie: I'm not expecting too much better from Winnipeg this year, either. I'll be legitimately surprised if they can manage to win 5 games this season.

As for playoffs, 3 teams from each division make it to the playoffs. There is a ""crossover rule"" that says if the 4th place team in one division has a better record than the 3rd place team in the other division, that 4th place team gets to ""cross over"" into the other division and play in the playoffs there. So effectively how it works out is that the top 2 from each division automatically make it and then the next 2 teams with the best records make it.

Since there are 6 teams going to the playoffs, the top team in each division gets a bye in the semi-finals week.

Other than that, let us know if you have any specific questions. The schedule hasn't been released yet but we're expecting the season to start around Canada Day (July 1) or maybe a week earlier now that the schedules weirded up by having an odd number of teams.

As for most championships won, there's no way that couldn't be Toronto. They're the oldest surviving professional sports team in the world. They've been around forever and picked up a million Grey Cups back in the days when they were just about the only team around. They're still a decent team. Sadly they're going to be homeless in a couple years and their city does not love them :("

JIVEprinting,Accounting,1389467661.0,"It would probably help a lot to hear where you are.  I changed majors in my senior year (from marketing) so my first semester as an accounting student was at the 300 level.


The most important thing by far is to do your homework, as well as everything else you're supposed to do.  If you do that you'll get A's and jobs will be handed to you on silver platters.  The entire shooting match is comprised in that -- do everything you're supposed to do.


Now.  To do that more effectively, I humbly submit three tips and tricks.


1  Do not struggle with something for more than half an hour.  At that point get help- preferably from an instructor or tutor.  Fellow students might help, but it's 50/50.  Reddit might help but it's too slow.  I wouldn't even bother with Google, and Youtube only contains introductory level content (everything Intermediate was exclusive to the UK last time I looked.)


Or pray, that's good too.  Then go do the dishes, call your mom (if applicable), or something otherwise responsible.  Maybe even nap, but do not start video games or internet.  Return to the problem.


2  Don't go home.  Go to the library, or a cafe.  If you go home you will suffer distraction in the magnitude of many hours.  Treat school like a job, and stay out there (and pushing forward) until 5:30 or some other applicable measure.


When doing practice tests (and possibly even some homework) mimic the testing environment.  Do not flip back in your book and find the answer; proceed as you would on a test.  This will give you a realistic evaluation of where you are and help your learning as well.  (It may be more time-efficient to flip back in the book as a ""normal"" approach, especially with tax, but do so with discretion.)


When doing actual (standardized, multiple-choice) tests, do not start at the beginning and proceed forward.  First flip through the test for an overview of what to expect (especially topical sections, or written problems) and then begin sniping off easy questions (or at least beginning the process of striking wrong alternatives out.)


Do this while you are still relaxed and calm, because once you start dialing in to difficult problems you will lose a lot of mental energy when you proceed to the next problem and have to evaluate (perhaps under growing stress) whether it is a difficult and stringent question or a casual one.


Do not fill in the answer form until the end.  Merely circle (or whatever) the correct answer on the test, then journalize all the correct answers (I like to use blocks of five) on the last page of the test.


Example:


AEDCC
BACCA
CDCAA


This makes it easy to fill in answers without making a ""bookkeeping"" mistake, and gives you more time and energy for the test.


For calculations, underline all relevant data in the problem and arrange your solution before you start punching on the calculator.  ""The wise solve before they calculate, whereas the ignorant calculate to solve.""  -- Sun Tzu, CPA


3  It is statistically unlikely that you will be in a truly challenging program, but if you are (and you're already doing the fundamental things well) then the following two game-changers can render your victory secure even in a hundred battles.


A -- Gleim's Exam Questions and Explanations (EQE) for Financial Accounting.  This one book covers introductory principles up through intermediate and beyond, and ought to be somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty bucks.  It provides exam-grade questions with answers on the facing page INCLUDING why the answer is right, and why the wrong answers are wrong, as well as a very concise overview of each topic (good for returning to it for reference after semesters have passed.)


B -- Tyrosine is the chemical opposite of melatonin; take 2-3 grams and you will focus better and erase the effects of fatigue for 6-10 hours without affecting heart rate or respiration.  You can get about eight doses on eBay in capsule form for something like $7.  Add a gram each of theanine and quercetin for further improvement.


Tyrosine is well-studied in scientific literature and featured in all effective study ""shots.""  Theanine is good by itself but works best with 1-2 cups of coffee (or a single caffeine pill, $4 at Walmart will get you about a hundred.)  If you feel sluggish for the first several hours you're awake and can't do anything productive, then you are getting older and require caffeine to get the most out of your time.


Godspeed.


**Edit:**  Shoot, I forgot the one thing I meant to say!


Get good at T-accounts.  Rely on T-accounts.  Whenever you have even the slightest hesitation what to do, scratch up a couple T-accounts.


At first it's boring and kind of needless, but it'll save you over and over later.


If you aren't immediately certain which T-accounts to use, start with writing the journal entry.



Gosh I wish someone had told me that.


If you're just starting out it might be 2 or even 3 years before this matters but you asked for tips and tricks, and thus you have."

Prodigy195,worldnews,1389467766.0,"My issue is that when the Pope says things publicly about loving gays, or how atheists can be redeemed through good works/deeds, or fighting to uplift poor it creates an almost cult of personality type persona but in reality nothing is really changed within the Catholic church.  The Pope can say all the greatest things in the world but unless he and the church make actual changes it's just lip service to placate people and repair the negative image that many have of the Catholic church after recent scandals.

Looks at some of his actual quotes 

*""If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?""*. 

*""A person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality. I replied with another question: ""Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?""*

Now these statements comes off as accepting and progressive but if you really examine the words he's not really saying much. Maybe what I'm asking for is unrealistic but he's just removing the onus from himself and placing the responsibility on god.  These come off as the responses of a politician not a religious leader."

Futurecat3001,DebateAnAtheist,1389468403.0,"Atheism is not a religion unless you expand the definition of the word ""religion"" to be so broad as to be meaningless.

Atheism is a positive truth claim: there is/are no god(s).  Atheism is not a ""belief,"" that anyone would uphold in the face of evidence to the contrary.  If the Christian God manifest himself tomorrow and explained that the Bible was indeed his word, then I would no longer be an atheist.  Until some God somehow makes itself known, however, I feel comfortable asserting that there is no God, because there is no evidence of one.

I feel the same way about invisible magic umbrellas that recite poetry in dutch.  They don't exist.  It isn't a religion, and it doesn't require faith, to assert that those magic umbrellas dont exist.  if I was presented with evidence to the contrary I would have to accept that they do, in fact, exist.  But as it stands today they don't, and I feel comfortable asserting that fact with as much knowledge as I can claim to have when asserting that I know anything at all.  Is it a religion to deny the existence of magic dutch-poetry umbrellas?  If it is, then it is also a religion to be an atheist.  But then the word religion just means ""a claim of knowledge that can be countered by the presentation of sufficient evidence,"" which as I said above is so broad as to render the word ""religion"" completely meaningless."

Perhaps if they were to make it a bit interesting, by just rendering you immobile? Blur your vision and keep sound on, so you can hear people talking, see them moving/transport you and similar. Also, it'd have to have quite a short range, otherwise snipers outside of the big cities could change to their tranq dart and just watch as zombies devours the poor sleeping people, who can do nothing about it. Perhaps an injection shot? So if people manage to get you hand-cuffed, they can put you to sleep for safe transport? Then you could even use it on yourself if you weren't smarter XD

I understand your distinction though. Beyond tolerance, there are other complex psychological factors to take into consideration. I believe that those are very subjective between users.

One of my friends is bisexual and her mother has some pretty odd ideas about it. She seems to think that bisexuals are gay or straight, but at different times. So for a while they're straight and then one day, for some reason, they switch back on over. 

It's very strange, but bisexuality is often misunderstood by people and it may be that all you can do is be patient and firm while explaining to her that there's nothing wrong with liking who you like and all you want is her acceptance. I know it's tough, though, but you said at first she didn't accept you liked girls; with any luck eventually she'll come to terms with it all. Hang in there and don't ever be afraid to vent - people rejecting your identity or making assumptions are horrible things to go through."

I fail to see how you can compare a handful of wealthy, educated expats that can probably speak the language to hundreds of thousands of uneducated, poor migrants who can't speak the language. 

&gt;Now that's anecdotal, I know, but every study out there says the same. They pay in and stimulate the economy way more than they get out of it.

So? There are more important things than money. 

&gt;The immigration ""issue"" is a cover for other issues. The (mostly British) bankers and real estate lenders fucked this country's economy up. MP's got an 11% pay rise, while still fiddling their expenses.

No, the immigration issue is an issue among many others. If you want to talk about bankers and real estate agents then you can, but this is a thread about mass immigration.

No one is blaming individual foreigners, can you find a reputable media outlet that does that? They're blaming the policy of mass immigration.

illiterate-,nursing,1389469882.0,"I'm Canadian, but we share similar nursing education. Where we are, we require a BSN RN to work in the NICU. Currently, I am in my 2nd year - last semester, my placement was on the pediatric ward. Sometimes, we were able to go into the NICU to do some placement hours. I'd recommend looking into the various nursing schools to see if there are NICU or peds placements. It will give you some experience in the area and you can decide for yourself if NICU is where you really want to be. Some people don't realize that you may be required to catheterize a 28 week old premie, insert nasogastric tubes, IVs, administer morphine to premies going through drug withdraw. (In my community, we have had our fair share of premies in the NICU due to mother's addictions - it was common sadly). Also, in the NICU, the premies require plenty of rest. You will not be able to hold these infants like you would a regular infant and will need to tell families to leave their infant in the bassinet because they are not thriving.

My experience there, was that it was a slower unit. A lot of documentation and careful assessments. I'm not sure about Chicago, I'm sure the NICUs there are a lot larger and handle more unstable premies than what we provide care for.

I'd suggest just jumping into the BSN program, but someone else might suggest something different. It really is up to you entirely. I just found that the BSN placements had a lot more variety. In our town, practical nurses were not permitted to work on labour and delivery, pediatrics, NICU, etc. But being an RN student allows you the experience.

There are advantages and disadvantages about going right into the NICU after graduating, but that'll be a few years away. Good luck!!"

TheMonologuer,gamingsuggestions,1389470003.0,"/u/MetaLandDivider is right, you don't really need to play them in a particular order to understand the story. Each can stand as an individual game. So, to answer your question, it depends.

Do you want to start off with a game with old-school Nintendo difficulty (i.e. banging your head against a wall and yelling obscenities at your screen)? Then go for the first one, Legend of Zelda. 

If you want something easy but still fun, go for The Wind Waker. 

The general fan favorite is Ocarina of Time. This one is moderately difficult, but not quite as hard as the first one. This is probably the one I would say to play first, as it is a fantastic introduction to the Zelda universe as it's challenging and just an overall good game.  If you play this one, it's a good idea to play Majora's Mask after, since Ocarina of Time is the only one with a direct sequel. 

I would start with one of those, then branch out. Here is a list of all the games with a quick explanation of each story. You can get most of these games on emulators or the Wii. http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_games"

There are also others there with similar, simple goals in mind to be healthy. We have common purpose, and just being at the, serves them as they serve me to strengthen our practice, our training. I'm at the gym to exercise. And it's more about the principles of exercise that I'm there to practice than any other. Gyms can be sick places. In other words, lacking a strong community of people, equipment, etc., such that I can't be healthy. Social proliferation is an important concept to consider in the gym. So I go elsewhere.

Church should also be the same. Social proliferation is more difficult to consider with more complex situations like the issues of how to live ones life and faith. But it still comes down to practicing principles and seeking out others in kind. If you absolutely can't find others however, one must feed themselves more with the Good Book and their walk with God, and remain a beacon for others. With the choices that do exist for many, church should be able to found that appeals to principles.

What is church? Plainly, the Bible says where ever two or more are gathered in my name, I (God) am there. What is one thing we do at church? Study the Bible. So start a Bible study. If it takes off, there other things like service to community as a group can happen.

Our walk aside from going to church is most important. Church should strengthen that walk for all members, the same as going to the gym is to strengthen it's members. Be careful about what is getting strengthened, taught or trained at any particular church. If you simply don't fit in at a church, make your own with a Bible study. The Bible along with the Holy Ghost to guide is all one needs to start."

n88888888,WritingPrompts,1389470515.0,"Disclaimer: I don't know too much about Sherlock, but I began writing and found it to be a fun prompt. Though factually, some things may be incorrect, I hope they don't completely take away from the writing.

They had caught us. But how? We were the greatest detectives, we knew the laws of crime. We, in theory, should have had this calculated so precisely, that the case would have never been anything more than a box of planted evidence for the police and detectives to scratch their heads over. Yet, *we* were caught.

I leaned over to Sherlock, giving him a sheepish smile. Yes, we were together in justice and in crime. It was comforting in a way, that we went down as captain and ship, *together for better or worse*.

“Well, sir, I guess this is the end of what we used to be.” I reflected on the incident and how it would shape the rest of our lives. If we had have gotten away with it, we would have been in another country by now. We would have riches to last us until our generation and the next were dead and gone.

“Indeed, Watson. And to think, we were caught by a rookie. We had specifically planned this to puzzle the best and most advanced investigators in the country, yet a rookie has played us to checkmate.” Sherlock had a way of being nonchalant in these kinds of situations.

I opened my mouth, but paused when Sherlock took a sharp breath in to speak.

“See, Watson. You know how we designed this crime?”

“To be a labyrinth to the best, sir?” I answered and asked at the same time.

“Indeed, Watson. To puzzle the best. Those who have the disadvantage of a mind already immersed in problem solving and modern-day crime.” He rubbed a portion of his ‘stache between his thumb and a finger, eyes sparkling in admiration and interest though our plans had been foiled, “Then they put a rookie on the case. Someone who has a fresh mind. Someone who doesn’t discredit the things we’ve been taught to ignore as detectives.”

I pulled at the cuffs of my jacket. I much preferred my grey woolen peacoat to the tasteless cream and black lined cotton rags. I felt like an albino honey-bee, segregated away from the rest of the world. It had only been a day and a half since our trial. There were many more days of striped cotton suits to come.

“See, Watson, they put that new boy, Arthur Doyle, on the case. That was something we couldn’t control. We *had* pulled off the perfect crime, Watson! We did it! But situational hazards do apply to even the most perfectly executed plans, you see.”

It was out of our control. We were not to know that they’d put Doyle in that role. Then he appeared a day and a half ago. During the trial, he showed evidence we had believed to be impossible to find. He was able to decode our plans that were written as love letters to a fictitious dame. They were not mistakes in our execution, but the mistake of overlooking who may be asked to interpret the crime scene.
“Watson, I have a confession.”

The echo of our voices resonated throughout the concrete dungeons. The city looked brighter than ever beyond the few slats I could see it through. Sherlock faced me, head tilted, hands clasped over his lap.

“Yes, sir?”

“You didn’t know Doyle before the trial. I had known him for quite some time.”

My brows furrowed, “Did you know he’d be put on our case, sir?”

Sherlock turned to look at the city, then to the bars of light shining onto the cell floor. He thought about my question, then answered with confidence, “No, good Watson, I hadn’t a clue. I thought he was an author, working in Scotland. There was little reason for him to find his way back to London.”

We sat in silence for some time. Water dripped, filling the cell with a rhythmically cadenced *‘bloop-bloop-bloop’*. I stood to look out the small window.

“So, Sherlock.” I began. I watched carts drive on cobblestone and people living their lives in a way I would soon come to forget. Lights were on in houses I had walked past but never seen. The sky was there, though I had hardly remembered to look up now and then to be enchanted by it’s beauty and marvel at it’s size. Framed by a cell window, it looked smaller than I had remembered, but what did *I* have to compare it too. I could hardly remember ever looking at it. Remembering I had trailed off, I began again. “Sherlock. Tell me more about Arthur Doyle.”

“Ah, Watson. I thought you’d never ask. Doyle was a smart lad, but had taken a different path in life before revisiting crime. See, he attended school with me, but had decided to focus on his fiction instead of law, as he had initially showed an interest in.”

“So he is a writer? Why now did he shift is focus, sir? It has been many years since either of us has attended school. Is he younger?”

“No, Watson, a peer of ours. His writing took on a nature that melded the fields. He began to write about crime and justice. As you can imagine, you need to become an expert in a field to write fictitiously about it, so to grow as an author, he decided to grow as an investigator as well.” Sherlock closed his eyes, as though to recall memories of many moons ago. “He was quite the goalie, too. I watched a match or two he was in. Goalkeeper. But I never thought he’d practice. At least not here.”

“Very good, sir. I see.” I paced, then regained my position at the window, “But how did he get us? We did so well, as you’ve said. We planted evidence, we got rid of fingerprints, we did everything in advanced codes.”

“Well, Watson. I am to blame. Do not be haste with judgements, but I developed those codes with my dear friend Arthur. We used to use our schoolwork to communicate with each other. We’d get a good beating if we were caught passing notes in school, Watson.  And you can imagine, speaking verbally was against the rules.” Sherlock raised a hand, then violently struck an imaginary set of hands. He raised his eyebrows. “I’m sure you agree this was a very intellectual project to undertake. Especially for boys out age. I should have known he'd have a memory. I should have known. We’d speak of our interest in crime.” Bowing his head, Sherlock spoke in disbelief, “I had told him my theories of how to catch the perfect criminal- us, Watson! Can you believe that the fates would line up as they have? I thought that Doyle was living in Scotland again, but he must have relocated to London.”

I was taken aback. Using a code that he had developed with the aid of another seemed to be a risk in itself. We were well known enough that word of our case probably would have reached Doyle, if not during the trial, than soon thereafter. 

“I trusted Arthur to hold true to our childhood friendship.” Sherlock joined me at the window. “But I suppose that justice rules all, even the mutual affection of friendship.”

There was silence. Now was not the time to turn my back on Sherlock. Perhaps his blunder had been the one fatal mistake in our crime, but we were once the men who stood for justice above all other temptations. I understood the actions of Doyle, and forgave Sherlock on his boyhood fantasy, which had not been as everlasting and merciful as he had remembered it as.

“Sir, one last question, if I may?” I returned to my seat, crossing my arms and leaning against the cool wall. A seam of concrete dug into my shoulder, so I shifted myself over to a smoother slate. Crossing my legs, I watched Sherlock pursuit his brain for answers to where he had truly gone wrong. Was it using the code? Or was it in trusting another being?

He spoke, “Watson, what is it?”

I cleared my throat, feeling hoarse. If I were in my own command, not that of the legal system, I would have ran a tap for some water. Things I had taken for granted. Licking my lips in attempts to achieve an acceptable amount of moisture, I began.

“This Doyle character... You said you watched a game he played in. Also, that your code was created in order to get away with communication where it was not permit-able. In school.”

“Yes, dear Watson. That is correct.”

“School. Is that where you met this man? Arthur Doyle. In which school did you meet?”   

With a smile on his face, Sherlock leaned back from the window. Smirking, he twirled his mustache as he shook his head. Our relationship and my last question were answered and represented in two words that spoke of our world before our crime. Sherlock opened his arms, palms up, and gestured to the town, beyond the tight restraints we had sent so many to.

bigtcm,nfl,1389470933.0,"Not necessarily.

Let's think about the 2012 projections of the 2013 season. No one really knows how each team is going to perform in the future, so the best we can do is to look at some metric of the 2012 season. You could use DVOA, Win-Loss, Division seeding, etc. Let's use Win-Loss just because it's easiest.

If you look at the 2012 Texans, their record was 12 -4, amongst the best in the league. If I'm making my own 2013 strength of schedule, I'd imagine that teams playing the Texans would have a harder time, since the 2012 Texans were so good (based off wins-loss record). I'd increase their SoS since they're playing the Texans.

However, the opposite couldn't be more true. The Texans sucked this year. Really bad. Schaub was terrible. Foster got injured. The defense turned to shit. Now that we know how each team since the season's over, we can go back and fix our projections. Now, instead of giving every team who played the Texans more points in the SoS, we're going to reduce them because well...the Texans turned out to be one of the worst teams in 2013. 

If you do all these corrections, the 2013 SoS changes drastically from the 2012 projections to the ACTUAL SoS.

James_GAF,jobs,1389471263.0,"I guesstimated and asked the question because there's not enough info to get an accurate effective tax rate based on a top marginal rate. Between exemptions, deductions and credits the taxable amount at both the state and federal level is difficult to estimate. Just based on the family size I would expect $20-30k federal deductions and exemptions at least. That number can go up based on lots of other factors. 

I can't even give a good number on payroll and Self-employment taxes because I don't know if that's a SE income, w2 employee or mixed income. Nor was a state mentioned to estimate that. Beyond that is a question of what sort of retirement savings they're doing and the amount of employer match going on. Same sort of questions on health insurance, because their out of pocket expenses can vary a great deal depending on how they're getting insured and what the policy details are. There's just not enough information, hence the questions. 

It sounds like a budgeting and debt issue, but that's only speculation with few hard numbers. 

Edit: There's also a question of how much retirement savings they're doing. That number could be quite massive relative to most peoples income between SS and I'm guessing 401k contributions. SS alone they're probably accumulating in excess of $50k/year retirement benefit from those taxes. Income which is taxed very low once attained. I mean if they're setting themselves up for a 6 figure income between SS and 401k in retirement that's pretty rich itself. More than the vast majority of people get."
chucky_z,PostgreSQL,1389471273.0,"I've been running pgtune and the configs seem to be way off.  Most of the tuning seems to be done in making the shared_buffers MUCH larger (1000mb -&gt; 5000-6000mb), the 'usable memory' to 3-4x the value, and 2-3x more assigned to the WAL log.  The main queries that give us problems are large ALTER queries.  What happens is they lock a table that is commonly used for SELECT's, and then a race condition happens and the ALTER locks itself while competing with the SELECT's.

Is there a way to avoid this with pgsql?  I know for MySQL it would be... not using an ALTER query (or working some InnoDB magic).  But unfortunately I'm dealing with a lot of premade mess that can't really be changed. :)

I don't want to talk bad about the previous admin, he really knew his stuff, but almost everything has extremely basic configs (not limited in any way to pgsql, apache is almost completely minimally configured and there is so much room for improvment across every bit of software)"

KidKangaskhan,AskReddit,1389471549.0,"This may get lost and you may never see this but I wanted share my thoughts. Your story hit home for me because I went through a very similar situation. I was a junior, she was a senior in HS. She was the first girl that really took notice of me. There was a mutual connection that just seemed to click and spending time together made me feel like the world stopped. When she graduated and went off to college we broke up and I felt empty inside. I sunk into a deep depression that took me years to crawl out of. Some of our circumstances are different (she cheated on me once) so the emptiness, longing, and jealously only fueled my descent. I was angry and developed a cycle of self-loathing which not only damaged myself but my family and friends during my senior year. I am telling you this not for your sympathy but to maybe help keep yourself out of the rut I put myself in. I want to emphasize that while things may get bad that they will eventually get better. I can't say that I am not scarred by those experiences but I have learned to love my scars instead of seeing them as points of shame.  Personally, I will feel like I will always love that girl but my understanding of that love has changed. I cherish my memories of her and what we had but that is different from truly missing her. Only time will help differentiate that for you, and since the wounds are so fresh it is too easy to mix those feelings. There may be times when you do truly miss her but recognizing the raw depth of your emotions for this girl is not bad but good. For me l needed to keep the perspective on myself. Knowing that the girl did truly care about you and was so emotionally bonded with you shows the depth of your character. Your abilities to be compassionate, caring, understanding, empathetic, patient, and most importantly loving are characteristics many girls or guys will find attractive. Never doubt your self worth when you continue to work through this. never. Feel free to message me if you want to talk more."

prettyladythrowaway,asktransgender,1389471829.0,"&gt;I like to think of it as ruthlessly honest. But if you want to think its shitty then that's okay. Same thing really.

People always think this when saying mean things.  There's no inherent truth to something just because you think the person doesn't want to hear it or it's controversial.  

&gt;I've met lots of happy well-adjusted passing trans and not one of them patted me on the head and went ""there, there. It's okay. Just be yourself"".

I actually know a lot of trans women.  I run a trans support group.  The ones that were happy were the ones that were OK with themselves, not much to do with passing.

&gt;I'm not even close to as hard as some of the girls I've met. I didn't want their sympathy. I wanted to pass like they did. I got good advice.

I mean you have this whole thing where you think sympathy is a bad thing and like powering through without weakness is a good thing.  And that is just a shitty, lonely way to go through life.

I do know that a lot of trans girls have trouble reaching out or not isolating themselves, and prefer to pretend they are not dependent on others for validation and support.  So I'm not surprised you met girls like that.

&gt;I think that's really a difference between trans who pass and those who don't. It's not luck. Or fortune. Or having supportive parents. Or being young. It's fear and need.

By and large, passing comes down to have the resources, body type, and desire to pass.  

If you don't think age, parents, and luck effect how well you pass, you have no idea what you're talking about.

The style does not look bad at all, and when the leather is an already darker brown it creates a nice contrast. I've owned a pair for months and they've aged nicely. I could argue that I'm just as attached as anyone else to their boots, and to say I'm not is blatantly ignorant. If you want to discuss the fashionableness (made that word up) of a style of boot, try starting a friendly discussion, instead of throwing aggressive insults.

Hey I'm not trying to tell you what to like at all. I haven't even offered an opinion on your boots. My comment was specifically directed at what compliments mean. Close friends (male and female, for what that's worth) have told me that they'll comment on something just because it'd be awkward not to mention it, and complimenting is nicer than saying ""wow, those boots/that tie//your face really stands out"".

The reason I ask is that in the Minguo calendar, a regnal system in use by Taiwan/RoC, the year is counted from the number of years that have passed since the founding of the Republic, making this the year 103 by Taiwanese reckoning. Prior to that, it was customary in China to refer to the year as the number of years since the current emperor came into power, for instance, when the Qianlong emperor first came into power, it would be the First Year of the Qianlong Era. 

This made it seem to me that, in Taiwan at least, the post-revolutionary era is just another age in Chinese history."

So they have a language in common, what is the issue? 

&gt;You failed to get my point. Immigration is being used as a scapegoat for what are inherently issues with the UK economy and UK greed - not the fault of immigrants. The current spate of EU blaming is the same.

No, you're trying to divert from one issue to another. If you want to talk about the miseries of capitalism we can do so, but that is not the topic at hand. 

&gt;Because in an unregulated capitalist system, employers pay as little as they can and bribe lawmakers to do their bidding.

Or perhaps it is because there is an extremely large pool of labour who are willing to work for very little. 

I'd just like to point out this little bit of cognitive dissonance: The economy is an unregulated capitalist nightmare full of greedy and selfish people that bribe the lawmakers to do their bidding, but immigration is a good thing because they make this economy stronger. How exactly do these two ideas fit together?

You obviously haven't understood my point about money. Is the rapid and *unregulated* change in Britain's cultural landscape worth it because CEOs and multinationals get richer from immigration? Now, you can brush aside a low minimum wage by inaccurately applying things I have said if you want to, but do you really think you should be doing so? Is it not the case that the principle cause of the left is the support and defence of the rights of the working class? Do you not think that a low minimum wage is very detrimental to the working class and that the reason minimum wage has remained so low is because there is a huge pool of exploitable labour? I mean, of course business will tell you immigration is great, they love that they can get some poor eastern european to work maximum hours for minimum wage and who'll think they're lucky for the privilege. But, what's great for business isn't always great for people.

AnotherCrazyOne,windows,1389473262.0,"This is pretty much expected at this point. I've committed my primary Windows workstation as it sits amongst five other machines of varying OSes to Windows 8.1 in my office. Getting rid of Windows 7 and moving to 8.1 is bittersweet. I'm doing all I can at this point to optimize for the desktop workflow as I build the machine up with software.

A tedious aspect of building up a machine's software workflow is having to go to the Start screen, then to apps, then to the Start screen again bringing with you the apps you want ready access to, and also putting primaries on the taskbar. This needs to be done better. And that app screen is dirty. It's something I want to hide from or least something that could offer more customization than it currently does. It's fugly.

PC Settings being tucked away as only a charm, while Control Panel has more global access is less than intuitive. Why are these two apps splitting the duties one would think should be all done in one place like System Settings are done on Ubuntu and Mac OS X?

Still no location manager type settings for moving around to different networks like on Ubuntu and Mac OS X. So, I use NetSetMan.

Finding my wireless printer, as there's now a lookup for that was a tease. I still had to add the address manually. Even my iOS clients find the printer automatically with zero config.

Aside from this though, some Metro apps are great and show promise. A couple are even elegant. However, it's the desktop I'm concerned with, and the underlying technologies of Windows 8.1. On the desktop Windows 8.1 seems to perform better than 7 so far, with a more elegant GUI that harkens my GNome themes on the other workstations I have. Windows 8.1 still lacks some of the style and workflow that can come from Compiz and other GUI/ workflow apps, as well as what OS X offers, but it feels and looks better than 7.

I'm looking forward to using it more and seeing what developers come up with. And there's something about using the OpenSSH client/server in Cygwin on 8.1 that's better than it was in 8. 8.1 is a lot snappier than 8. Not sure yet what that is but perhaps some TCP/IP stack changes somewhere. Something I'm gonna research a bit to see about.

8.1 is certainly not something to shout about to anyone yet. To other power users, I could at least say, give it a try. For others though, it's still unfinished .

Like I said, it's bittersweet. After using 8 for a little while on one of my other workstations and then getting rid of it, and working on 7, I realized I missed some things and began to hate the 7 GUI even more. So I'm taking the plunge. I hope it pays off. I know in some technical ways, it'll be more work perhaps. I hope a lot of that will be because of a learning curve rather than things actually being worse. I'm not holding my breath though after seeing the last AMA that Microsoft did here.

I guess I'm now just willing to put the extra effort in that I wasn't before. For Microsoft though, that's not much of an ad slogan."

Finally, it is ok if you don't make this a priority right away.  We all want to get back in shape and feel good about our bodies, but life with a newborn is already a major lifestyle change.  Avoid getting into bad habits, but be forgiving if you don't have the energy to start new good ones.  Don't neglect your physical health, but it is ok to let your mental health take priority.

behindtimes,short,1389473895.0,"Don't really know, but even with that, there's variance in terms of symptoms.  Some people have it and look normal.  I on the other hand look like your stereotypical nerd (coke bottle glasses and all, but not clothing).  Unfortunately, I'm not a candidate for laser correction, and can't really see with contacts.  I also can't really gain muscle.  (Tall &amp; lanky).

Disadvantages are not just in the dating world, but even in the job market and other areas.  It opens up your eyes early in life that people are fairly hypocritical and extremely shallow.  And I'm not talking about ""socially accepted nerd"" either that seems to have cropped up over the past decade or so.  There's a quote from the Simpsons when Moe is auditioning for a movie.  ""I wanted Mary Ann on ""Gilligan's Island"" ugly, not Cornelius on ""The Planet if Apes"" ugly. TV ugly, not... ugly ugly.""  The same holds true here.

To paraphrase one post below from GeoffreyArnold, we as a society have attributed negative connotations to certain appearances.  A shorter stature happens to be one, but it's not the only one with negative connotations.

And yes, it's possible to overcome certain obstacles if you can offset them.  When you bring up Nicolai Valuev, he has many traits which can perhaps counterbalance his face, such as body, wealth, vocation, etc.  Other people aren't so lucky.

It's like, even in terms of a job, my physical appearance makes people think I'm not capable of certain things, which thus puts me in a lower status job, which makes it harder to prove myself and get ahead.  (The ""Let's give that nerd the stuff nobody wants to do.""  ""Oh, he must like doing that stuff."" Etc.).

And it's difficult to break out of a cycle of negativity.  There are always the posts of ""Just change your attitude"".  Some people mean well, but are naïve imho, as they don't really have any point of reference in their own lives to comprehend the negativity.  Others just don't want to hear anything that disagrees with their world view.  It's hard to break years of resentment.  I guess the best way to describe it would be like having someone trying to change their dominant hand for every days tasks as an adult.  Sure, it can be done, but it's not easy, and there's always a chance it might never feel natural, and it's very easy to slip back to using your original dominant hand to write."

Also, just because she doesn't get involved in tons of extracurriculars or go out much doesn't mean she is immature or not ""growing.""

""Hey, you lily-livered coward. Come on out!"" yelled 'Madman' Maury. 

Randy knew his time was up.
""Alright. Alright. I'll come on out.""
Then he had an idea.

""Wait! Wait! I left the stove on!"" He yelled, as he high-tailed it out the front of the barn, right past the confused gunslinger. He stole a horse and rode West as fast as he could, narrowly avoiding his last day on earth. 

Meanwhile, Maury was relieved too. He was the town's doctor, not a Sherrif for Christ's sake.

""One less wound for me to treat,"" he thought. ""And it wouldn't have been on the outlaw!""

Give some extra thought to location, make sure there is reasonable access to medical services.  If you can find one that has decent bathroom and shower facilities that is ideal.  You want to be somewhere that you can bring extra baggage without having to carry it all in, by that point you'll have figured out what kind of support you need sleeping and you'll want to bring the extra pillows and whatever to keep you off your belly.  You also want to pack so that you aren't struggling with anything to heavy, more bags in smaller sizes.  Be extra cautious with food storage, make sure you have enough ice for the coolers and don't take any risks with how food is packaged or stored.  Don't go hiking anywhere that you can't bail out if you get too fatigued, at 25 weeks you will be in a sweet spot for feeling well and having some energy, but you'll also be carrying enough extra that being on your feet for extended periods and exerting yourself could have a very negative effect on your nethers and lower extremities.  You don't want to learn that 2 miles from the trail head.  Make sure you stay hydrated, always have snacks handy.

Finally and most important, make sure your friends are on board with helping you out and giving you a break.  You don't want to drag them down, that's no fun, so be willing to sit out a more strenuous hike or take responsibility for a little extra food and cooking so that the burden isn't on them.

I would certainly do it again, I get stir-crazy and impatient without activities to take my mind of the belly dweller.  I just pamper myself a little extra, and I go with my husband who is perfectly happy to accommodate me and totally willing to leave me back at camp with a book if I'm not up to an activity.

prettyladythrowaway,asktransgender,1389477140.0,"&gt;There's no inherent truth to platitudes either. What I said was for OP to feel better about being scared of not passing. Not passing scares me too. Some people need to pass. It doesn't have to be perfect; but for some people it has to work. I am one of them.

No one is saying platitudes besides you.  

It's not really OK to say what you said regardless of the justification.  

&gt;Some trans people will only be happy if they can pass and adjust to life in role. I'm one of them. Maybe OP is too. Maybe your girls aren't. Different people have different needs. If the idea of not passing scares somebody then they can use that fear to help them pass..

Sure but part of that is respecting others.  You can't respect others if you think it's a good thing that you're uncomfortable around them.

&gt;You don't know me. Please don't extrapolate my personality from a short message where I tell a random stranger online it's okay to be scared about not passing and that it can be a sign that they're serious enough to attempt transition. And that fear can be a good stimulus. Stick to your face-to-face support group. You were pretty wide of the mark btw.  

Like I'm sorry but the pattern of your advice is pretty easy to discern.  The advice you've given doesn't define you but it is shitty advice for the reasons I stated above.

&gt;I have some idea what I'm talking about. So do a few other people in this forum. I just happen to have a different idea to you. There is no right and wrong way to be transgender.

This isn't about ways of being transgender.  This is about you saying a shitty thing.

Unicornrows,self,1389477182.0,"I have been there. I have a slightly different take than many people on it. One that often seems to garner downvotes... but I'll throw it out there anyway.

I like to look at people from a biological perspective. I think our happiness is very much tied into our reproductive drive. From this perspective, a breakup is depressing because you had a mate and now you don't.  When you say you are depressed because you hate your looks, it's because you think your looks affect your reproductive chances.

On a chemical level, your body misses the physical touch, sex, her scent, staring into her eyes, etc., which all release lots of chemicals like oxytocin, dopamine, testosterone, and serotonin. That stuff made you feel good because your body is ""designed"" by evolution to reproduce.

 All the humanistic concepts like friendship, connection, and romance are generally built on top of this crude biological system. It's definitely nice to find someone with a compatible sense of humor and interests, but there's a reason relationships like Harold &amp; Maude are so rare.

So do what you can to feel good about your reproductive chances. Get another girlfriend who has whatever qualities you liked in the last one (easier said than done, maybe.) You have to satisfy your pair-bonding drive somehow. One night stands won't necessarily help this kind of thing; they make you feel good about your attractiveness, but they actually endanger your reproductive chances in some ways (you don't want to knock up the wrong girl). But they often give your biology that quick fix even though your prefrontal cortex knows it's a bad idea. Ultimately, I think that the solution is to find a relationship with a girl who meets your criteria of a good mate, whatever that means to you (not only physical, but mental and circumstantial qualities.)

And recognize that it's a biological &amp; chemical depression, not a logical one. Your body is giving you emotions and you are putting them into words, but they don't really describe reality, only your emotions (for example, thoughts like ""the world is boring"" is just a feeling, not a fact.)

 Your biology wants you to have kids NOW NOW NOW, even though that would generally be a dumb thing to do, compared to planning out a family when you have the means to support them. Just recognizing that fact makes me take those kind of urges less seriously.

lightningrod14,AskReddit,1389477381.0,"           reformatted to be easier on the eyes:

My story is a little long, probably cliche and in too much detail but it's my passion so here you go,

I met her freshman year in gym. 

From the first time I ever laid eyes on her, even then in my stupider and immature days, I knew she was different. She had a beauty I could feel. Her hair was so long and natural and amazing. Her striking blue eyes killed me every time they made contact with mine.

I did dumb things to try to impress her like any dumbfounded freshman would and none of it worked. A year went with no progress, we were pretty much still strangers other than the maybe once a week small talk conversation in the hallways. But I finally got a cell phone and the first thing I did was take it to her and without asking she put her number in it. 

There was maybe about 6 months of small talk texting that led nowhere but I was destined to comprehend her and understand all of her. We eventually started talking more and more and one night she called me and we talked for over 4 hours. At the end of the conversation she said ""I love you"" and me being stupid fucking me froze up and said ""wut?"" then she hung up. 

I texted her immediately and said ""I love you"" and she replied back and said ""Yes, that's what I said"" but I think I scared her because after that she was weird about getting emotional with me and told me that when she said she loved me she meant just as a friend. 

At this point i'm like heartbroken and feeling empty because all I ever did was think about her and think about wanting to be able to love her and being loved back. It was the first and only time I've ever felt such strong emotion from another person. We had so many things in common and we shared everything with each other. The understanding we had is indescribable and incomparable. 

Next we're juniors, age 16, we go on a coffee date, come back to my house and I take for a walk on a trail through the woods. We get 10 feet into the woods and she stops and makes the come fucking kiss me face. I hadn't kissed a girl a that point since middle school. I kissed her on the lips, like a tiny peck and stepped back nervous as shit. She said ""No, I want a real kiss"" so I tried but it was pretty much just me smashing my lips into hers with no other action so I stepped back again, trembling, feeling like my throat was about to explode and I could barely talk to stutter and mumble out ""I don't know how to do this, I don't have experience and i'm nervous"" She told me not to worry and said that she would teach me. 

I was so happy about everything that was going on. Life was great at that point. We had a weird relationship where we hung out sometimes and kissed sometimes but we were still just friends. She was cautious about letting me love her, I could tell she's been hurt before. It got bad like to the point where I would get angry because she push me away and rejected me anytime I even mentioned the word love. She kept telling me that she didn't want me to love her because she's ""not a good person to love"" But that only inspired the pursuit that much more.

I tried too hard though and I fucked up. I was high and said something I didn't mean at all but I said them because it's what I thought she wanted. She completely stopped talking to me for 2 weeks and those 2 weeks were dark. But I stopped her at school when I couldn't take it anymore and we talked, then she took me home. Got out of her car to hug me bye, but after the hug she looked up and said ""I really want you to kiss me right now"" so I smiled and I did and felt so great. 

Then everything went to shit for no reason. We didn't talk for months and I was devastated and felt so fucking horrible. I had a darkness over me and everyday hurt. I tried to make her understand but eventually she stopped caring. 

Now in the story it's around the end of the school year and we still haven't talked. Into June and she's got a new boyfriend. He's 19, long hair, guitar player with a tattoo. A fucking tool. But I knew what she was doing so I let her be her. June 30th is my birthday and she didn't tell me happy birthday until 11:59pm through a text. That hurt. 

The rest of the summer went by with not too much happening. But one morning we had another long phone call. She just randomly called me and it was still so easy to talk to her. We talked for a few hours and then started texting regularly, then texting each other every second of everyday. From good morning to good night. He doubts in her boyfriend increased as her newly found interest in me increased. She started taking me home from school so I saw her everyday, we were spending more and more time together. 
One day after school she said that she had nothing to do and asked me if I wanted to go somewhere. So we got frozen yogurt then sat in parking lot and just talked for hours. You should see the cycle by now. I had my best friend back and was pretty happy. 

A day or two later she dumped her boyfriend for no other real reason than well... me. I asked her to homecoming just as a friend because she was on the homecoming court and had no one to go with. We went out to eat before the dance and had the most fun I've ever had. We came up with a little plot to leave our waitress a generous tip and make her happy for the night, we wrote a note on a napkin for her and then went outside to watch her be surprised when she reads it and gets the tip that was twice the cost of the order. Making other people happy while you're with someone being happy is the best thing. 

We ended up leaving the dance after 5 minutes to go make out in her car. That was the most intense kissing ever. I felt high. Getting my tongue sucked on for the first time lol. 

An hour went by in what felt like 5 minutes and we both looked up, had forgotten where we were and realized we were still in the school parking lot at around 11. She took me home and I gave her a good bye kiss. When she got home she texted me talking about how great her night was and how great kissing was. She said ""You really love me don't you?"" Obviously I said ""Of course, more than anything"" and she said ""I could feel it when we were together"" I answered just by saying ""I love you Madi"" then I got a ""I love you too."" 

That's where I wish it ended. If I could of just been stuck in that moment of time for the rest of eternity I couldn't be happier. After 3, almost 4 years I finally did what I knew I could. She felt it. The pure essence of love. But love stories aren't love stories without bad parts. We were ""together"" now. We hungout everyday and effortlessly had fun. My parents made the mistake of leaving us home alone and I just so happened to lose my virginity. That love was incredible. Probably why the scars are so deep now. 

After a while Madi continued on the cycle of being Madi and started making up reason to doubt our relationship. She was making up problems and creating new ones just to have a reason for things to not be okay. She said she felt like we weren't progressing so she needed to stop loving me. Me being the understanding lover boy, was fine with whatever her decision may be. But she said to me the day before ""I always make plans with people but they're never there later in my life to take part in those plans"" So when she trying to pushed me away for the third time now I think, I said to her on the phone ""do you remember what you said to me yesterday, about no one ever being there? It's because you won't let them be there."" 

I know she started crying, because everything went silent. 

I said her name maybe 10 times and she didn't answer. then she hung up. I get a text 5 seconds later saying ""What's wrong with me?"" and we semi-solved her issues. Then the next time she saw me, she kissed me. 
I was so confused. We were together again but she was acting weird. She didn't want to hangout with me, or even sit and talk to me. She just wanted to go home to be alone. At least that's what she said. This part lasted about a week before she completely pushed me out. 

This time it was real. She wouldn't even have a conversation with me without turning it into an argument. Then she asked me if I wanted to go with her to my friends house. First I questioned why she wants me for anything and why would she want to go hangout at his house? 

After that day I figured it all out. We were there just chilling and she acting super cute and doing all of this flirty stuff, but not to me. To my friend. After we left I asked her a question I already knew the answer to. ""You like him don't you?"" And she got extremely defensive and got mad at me for even asking. She never ever answered what I asked. 

Now they're dating or hanging out or whatever and i'm almost sure she was talking to him before ending the relationship with me. She did to me to what she did to the guy before me. The bad thing is I'll know she'll do the same thing again. She'll come back to me because we know each other better than anyone does. I know I should move on because they're are so many beautiful people in this world to experience but when she comes back I won't have to power to tell her no. Love for her is the only thing I've ever known. She'll hurt me again and I won't do anything to stop her. If I could just spend 1 more hour with her to feel this hurt for the rest of my life, I would. It would be worth it just for the time. I love her.

And that will never change.

                     i also fixed a few typos and stuff, i hope that's okay."

Same sex marriage is important for trans people too. Plenty of trans people are bi or homosexual, and even if they are straight then if the state they're in doesn't recognize them as their identified gender then guess what looks like they need same sex marriage to get married in that state.

On top of that society kind of sees the lumped together anyway, so that helps link them. Also you have to remember being trans is pretty rare. Far rarer than being gay, so there are significantly fewer trans people than there are homosexual or bisexual people. The trans population isn't big enough to really get progress made by themselves, they need the rest of the LGBT movement for weight. They going for relatively similar goals, and are discriminated against for similar reasons.

Finally I kind of resent the fact that the black movement didn't help gays being used as justification for gays leaving out trans people. Just because another group did it doesn't mean that the LGB should kick the T to the side of the road, and possibly never come back."

keypuncher,conservatives,1389477675.0,"&gt; This piece is terrible. 

I agree.  What is going on is definitely terrible.  I'm pretty sure that is not what you meant though.

&gt; I don't think huge torrents of unassimilated Muslim immigrants is a good thing (as you can see in Paris, or Malmo) but the issue there is ultimately poverty, not religion. 

No.  There have always been poor people in Paris and Malmo - rape gangs and honor killings are a relatively new phenomenon that came with the Muslim immigrants.

&gt; As for this article:

&gt; * The U.S. is in exactly zero danger of having Sharia law imposed.

Overall?  I agree, for the moment.  Muslims make up less than 1% of the population here even with the tens of thousands imported in the last few years, and Muslims don't generally start being a big problem for a country until they hit around 5% of the population.  That doesn't stop them for agitating for Sharia however, or getting it in localized areas.

&gt; * The claim that there are ""a few"" who ""dare"" to speak again Sharia/Islam is laughable.

Given that it can cause loss of employment and threats from the Federal Government, not so laughable.

&gt; * Islam and Islamism *are* different things, analogous to Christianity and Christian fundamentalism.

Mmmhmmm.

&gt; * The evidence for creeping Sharia law or whatever in this article is largely anecdotal, cherry-picking incidents and outcomes without any context. 

Of course it is.  Any evidence of anything is going to be anecdotal - and what was presented was just from 2013.

&gt; The reason this country is in exactly zero threat of Sharia law is, of course, the separation of church and state.

Think about it like this OP:

If a Woman has a Baby, there is a 100% chance it is hers, right? A man has no such guarantee it is his. If he is to commit his life's work towards raising a family, how can he be sure (from a genetic standpoint) the kids are his? This is why past promiscuity is viewed so negatively by men who are seeking a long-term committed relationship. Thousands of years of human reproduction and evolution is screaming ""She's Risky!"" in the back of our heads."

This tooth color is normal even for a horse that regularly sees a dentist.  That's because a horse's enamel is on the inside of the tooth, not the outside, so they are more prone to staining.  It's not a big deal since it's just discoloration, and it doesn't indicate poor care or a horse in need of a dentist visit."

The general idea is to try and keep 3 minions on the board, clear when efficient to do or to stop being able to do it efficiently. If you have board control you don't need much removal really, you have backstab, evis, deadly poison, si-7 for anything big.

Generally for a deck like this you'd also run leeroy jenkins and 2 cold bloods for kill potential but I doubt you have him.

dinosauru,childfree,1389478380.0,"No, it's not. This is about urgent, nearly-irresistible body demands due to hormonal dysfunction.

Doctors/the media love to sell this idea that it's just about eating less and having self-control. It's not. I have been on both sides of this issue and have seen many many many people attempt to lose weight. When you do it the right way (cutting carbs almost completely), it does not require much self-control at all. Nor does it require calorie-counting or self-starvation. When you cut out carbs and your hormones are able to re-regulate themselves, you stop feeling hungry and fidgety and stressed about food all the time. Because that is a hormonal issue. You don't even have to exercise or self-limit your food intake, really. You just naturally lose weight and feel less hungry.

The people I've seen attempt to lose weight just by summoning ""self control"" and starving themselves and exercising more almost invariably cannot keep it up after a while, because it never gets easier. Sure, you can form habits and that makes it less of an everyday conscious effort, and you might even get used to feeling hungry, but you'll never rid yourself of the internal jittery desire to EAT EVERYTHING. You just have to constantly stuff it back down and form this elaborate martyr complex until someday, when you're vulnerable, it all comes rushing back up again and suddenly you've eaten the whole buffet and washed it down with a pallet of oreos.

Invoking ""self control"" in this manner is simply not longterm-sustainable because it's not fixing the actual problem. Every day will be an internal struggle until someday you can't take it anymore. And calling someone weak for not being able to carry on under that tremendous boulder every single day forever is, imo, not just hurtful and misguided, but just plain wrong.

I've lost 130lbs, and it was pretty easy. I'm now normal and relatively healthy whereas at one point I was 300lbs. I don't count calories and, at this point in my life, I eat pretty much whatever I want within reason. The thing is, I really don't want much sugar/starch anymore, so I just don't eat much of it. I lived for 2 years without it in an attempt to repair my hormones, and now I find it pretty uninteresting since my body isn't screaming for a sugar fix anymore.

My only rule now is that I don't eat anything I don't really want (I don't just shovel it in because it's in front of me if I'm not actually hungry for it) because food for me now is about enjoying the sensual experience, and why would I want to waste my hunger satiation on a sub-par experience?

I hate to be one of those people who's like ""I ALONE HAVE THE ANSWERS FOR HUMANITY"", but honestly, after watching so many people bang their heads against a wall, and having done it myself repeatedly for most of my life, and then finding a way that feels as natural as waking up in the morning, and having done a ton of research and reading, and having a partner who's had the same experience, and knowing a fuckton of people who have done the same thing, I'm pretty sure I know what I am talking about."

thenYES,AskWomen,1389478822.0,"I've got a few.

Woman Who Cowers in a Corner: in action scenes, when a woman is threatened or was about to be attacked but a male hero steps in and starts fighting the attackers, I HATE when the woman just cowers there, looking scared and breathing heavily. ESPECIALLY if the guy helping her is getting beat (before of course, miraculously mustering his strength and winning). She should either run away (to safety, or to get help), or she should help fight. It especially bothers me if the fight scene is in a kitchen or industrial space where there are plenty of weapons lying around that she could grab to protect herself/help her defender. But no, she just *has* to sit there whimpering. Screw that.

Fridging, or Revenge plots where a man has to revenge the rape/murder/abduction/torture of his wife/girlfriend/sister/mother/daughter. It's just overdone at this point, and it has ceased to be interesting. And it's really obnoxious and messed up when brutal violence against women is used as a plot point to give the male character a cool heroic quest/storyline. I loved the inversion of this trope in *True Grit*, with Mattie avenging her father's death. 

The Really Really Ridiculously Good-Looking Girl that somehow never gets noticed by men (or other girls)--usually because she's ""quiet"" or ""shy"" or ""awkward"" or some other weak characterization. Popular in a lot of high school comedies/dramas. *Easy A* comes to mind. This is just unrealistic to me.

This isn't a trope, really, but...how glammed up so many women look in movies/shows when it makes no sense for the situation. Like waking up in bed with a full face of makeup, including eyeliner and even FALSE EYELASHES. Really? I don't care if they stick some foundation and concealer on to even out their skin, but a full face of makeup after waking up or after getting out of the shower is just ridiculous. This is especially annoying to me because I feel like it's been getting worse recently, and the women have been getting more glamorous even when it doesn't make sense for their character/situation. It's unrealistic and distracting.

I recall reading an earlier post of yours, so I understand that this is not the first time you have felt that your needs were not being respected.  In any relationship there are times where we let things slide, and times when we push back.  I imagine the pushing back part can be rather difficult when you normally enjoy your submissive role, so I would suggest focusing on the communication here.

Take some time in a neutral setting to calmly and clearly outline that you don't feel your needs are being considered and met by your partners.  Be as clear as you can about what you expect.  What you are capable of doing and what you believe you should have to do with the support of a large and loving family are two very different things.  

When you as a sub find it necessary to stand up for your own needs, it means your dominant partners have collectively dropped the ball.  It's ok to point that out, you can do it in a calm and loving way, and give them the opportunity to fix things.  If you have to go so far as to make specific demands of them, your relationship dynamic is going to become problematic, so focus on clearing up the communication first.

While we don't have an official standard dialect, the de facto ""television standard"" is not based on Washington DC's dialect--it's from part of the Midwest.  Hebrew is another example, mostly because there aren't really geographic dialects in Modern Hebrew (though there are ethnolects), though it is a strange case anyway because the standard from the academy isn't the prestige dialect.

Also, many languages have a standard that isn't *anyone's* native dialect.  A number of countries have Standard Arabic as a standard, but that's not the dialect of anywhere, and is quite divergent from the dialects of some of the countries where it's spoken.  That's true to an extent for many, if not all, standard languages (the UK's standard is RP, not Estuary English), but Arabic is a bit extreme in that regard.

One of the smartest things I ever did was cruise the library at another school (and environs near the accounting classes) during finals week and rescue entire notebooks or stacks of slideshow printouts from the trash.  A few hours with these paved an excellent head-start into the intermediate topics, which is what you will need.  Hard material needs to be taken in turns: orient yourself with the topic, then examine it in detail to identify the internal logic and connections, and then drill the problems and calculations.  (The smarter you are, the more you can do all at once, but good grades in accounting will include the meta-skill of working with your own rhythms and learning mechanisms most favorably.)


Homework, by the way, is consistently the best use of your time you can possibly make in intermediate accounting courses.  These have a higher return than almost anything.


By the way, remember to sleep.  Once your efficacy drops below about 70%, you will only progress very slowly if at all.  Clean some house, pray, and go to sleep.  Staying up 2 more hours trying to push forward with low returns will rob you of 2 great hours the following morning where you can make some real inroads.


Be warned also that accounting at junior college is soft and weak- like cream cakes with fruit salad on top!- but junior and senior year accounting at a university will be relentless and fierce- like a storm coming down the face of Mount Fuji!


And if this has over-prepared you, then that'll only work in your favor.


Thank you for your reply.  I am glad to be able to help."

When he relaxes back down, reward him with a treat, and rinse and repeat as you try to get them closer (but not within range of those jaws).

I don't really suggest spending a lot of time in r/accounting but I did update a couple points, let me paste them:


Get good at T-accounts. Rely on T-accounts. Whenever you have even the slightest hesitation what to do, scratch up a couple T-accounts.

At first it's boring and kind of needless, but it'll save you over and over later.

If you aren't immediately certain which T-accounts to use, start with writing the journal entry.

Gosh I wish someone had told me that.

If you're just starting out it might be 2 or even 3 years before this matters but you asked for tips and tricks, and thus you have.




One of the smartest things I ever did was cruise the library at another school (and environs near the accounting classes) during finals week and rescue entire notebooks or stacks of slideshow printouts from the trash. A few hours with these paved an excellent head-start into the intermediate topics, which is what you will need. Hard material needs to be taken in turns: orient yourself with the topic, then examine it in detail to identify the internal logic and connections, and then drill the problems and calculations. (The smarter you are, the more you can do all at once, but good grades in accounting will include the meta-skill of working with your own rhythms and learning mechanisms most favorably.)

Homework, by the way, is consistently the best use of your time you can possibly make in intermediate accounting courses. These have a higher return than almost anything.

By the way, remember to sleep. Once your efficacy drops below about 70%, you will only progress very slowly if at all. Clean some house, pray, and go to sleep. Staying up 2 more hours trying to push forward with low returns will rob you of 2 great hours the following morning where you can make some real inroads.

Be warned also that accounting at junior college is soft and weak- like cream cakes with fruit salad on top!- but junior and senior year accounting at a university will be relentless and fierce- like a storm coming down the face of Mount Fuji!

And if this has over-prepared you, then that'll only work in your favor.

Thank you for your reply. I am glad to be able to help."

eighthgear,anime,1389481615.0,"&gt; stealth in warfare only came about after the middle ages since before then it was considered cowardice before an enemy to use any kind of means of conceilment.

I'm pretty sure the Germanic forces at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest weren't worrying about the Romans calling them cowards for using concealment. Similarly, Sun Tzu talks about using concealment of forces all the time.

There was not as much of an emphasis on stealth and concealment in large-scale battles because due to technological limitations, large-scale battles were generally fought by large blocks of men. It is hard to camouflage a phalanx, for example. But many groups have used stealth and concealment throughout history for all sorts of purposes."

Secondly, you should have let the car charge for a bit when you jumped it. As the car is running the alternator is recharging the battery. Get it jumped again and let the car run for a while 30-45 minutes for it to see if the alternator is going to charge it.

Once you've determined the battery is charged, i'd drive right over to Autozone and get your battery tested. How old is your battery? When is the last time it's been replaced.

Also, whilst China certainly deserves credit for gunpowder, invention and development are two different things. The use of gunpowder in warfare was only developed by the Chinese to a fairly limited degree, compared to how it would be used by other groups such as the Turks, and yes, eventually the Europeans. Whenever people talk about European innovations in gunpowder warfare, someone inevitably comes in and starts talking about how the Chinese invented the stuff. And that is true.

The way I see it, you have three choices:

1. Make one up, since one doesn't already exist. You can make all sorts of corruptions for 'jarl' which makes your setting marginally better because you're taking time to distinguish it from real life. Stealing real life words for fictional places? Come on. Once you've got a version of 'jarl' you like, then decide what the 'feminine' form of it would be.
2. Write in translation. The equivalent in English is dependent upon which sense you mean 'jarl.' While somebody else mentioned 'countess,' jarl can also refer to a king, so baroness, duchess, princess, queen... whatever you intend the title to mean in English. If you're going to do this, then consistently using English for titles would be the way to go. This is a good way to write from a single perspective.
3. Just use 'jarl.' Jarl was a genedered title because the political system was gendered. If yours isn't, then jarl can be neuter instead. They do that in Skyrim."

All in all, you have a large number of exercises going on here for someone who is starting to strength train. I think you would be best served by one of the linear progression programs, such as Starting Strength, Greyskull LP, Stronglifts 5v5, etc. Your current routine, I think, will see slower weight increases than one of the linear routines.

For diet, I would look and see how lean some of that food is. Also, figure out your TDEE, and start tracking what you eat. Set a weight gain goal and start working towards it. Myfitnesspal has worked really well for me."

Part One
----
Deep up the mountains, the sheriff of Buncombe County drove. His name was Sly Redmont, at least that's what everyone called him. As he drove, the sound of the radio became fuzzy and more difficult to hear until it cut to static altogether. Sly was too preoccupied to notice and let the white noise seamlessly sink into rhythm with his thoughts. He nervously puffed on a cigarette, the smoke trailing out the cracked window into the crisp mountain air.

Ten miles up the switchbacks and steep inclines of the Smoky Mountains was a small cabin where Sly's brother, Lincoln, lived. Lincoln sat at the wooden table he had carved himself, with the help of an old Cherokee man. Lincoln's wife was walking around the cabin, going through the various tasks wives often do when preparing to leave for the day.

“I just don't,” she huffed, wiggling her feet into her boots, “see why you need me to go to the city and pick up more supplies. I thought you had gotten everything for your camping trip on your drive downtown last weekend!” Lincoln looked at his watch and stood up, glancing out the window at his long driveway. He lit a cigarette, earning an immediate sigh from his wife. Born and raised in this town, her southern accent seemed to permeate even this voiceless expression.

“I wish you wouldn't do that,” she mumbled as she wrapped a scarf around her neck. Lincoln watched her with caring eyes, managing a small, brief smile. Distant pattering of feet could be heard nearing the back door. Two boys burst through the screen, loudly arguing about who stepped on whose toes.

“Daddy!” stomped the younger boy, “it's not fair!” and both boys began to talk over each other, competing to have their side of the story heard. Lincoln picked up the younger son and hushed them both gently.

“Boys, did you just walk in the house, right past your mama, and not give her a kiss?” Lincoln winked at his older son as his wife put her hands on her hips and raised her eyebrows. Lincoln set his young boy down and gave him a light kick in the pants. Both sons gave each other a final, quiet shove and the argument was over. Lincoln looked at his watch again. His wife noticed.

“Alright, we better get going, boys,” she said. “Your daddy has things to do, and doesn't need us around to bother him!” Lincoln didn't mean to come across rudely. He could tell she was a little offended, so he walked over and placed his hands on her shoulders.

“I love you, May,” he said softly, and kissed her. A chorus of “ew!”s came from the boys, but the way his wife smiled and rolled her eyes excused it. After herding the boys out the door and into the old blue truck, Lincoln's wife called for her sons to wave at Daddy. They waved obnoxiously and Lincoln stood at the door watching until the truck was out of site.

Sly drove closer up the mountain to Lincoln's cabin. With each familiar landmark, he grew more nervous. His mind was running back to the previous afternoon, when he found out what Lincoln did and subsequently what had to happen next. He was in the office, laughing about his deputy's deer hunting story when his old friend, Moe Jackman from the Asheville Police Department, walked pale faced into the room.

“Sly,” he said, “we need to talk.” Both men retreated to Sly's office where Moe shut the door and drew the blinds.

“What is it, what's the matter? Good Lord, you look whiter 'n a birch tree. Have some water.” Sly handed him a cup, which Moe took. He began pacing the floor, then stopped and sat down, inviting Sly to do the same. When both men were sitting, Moe leaned forward and asked if Sly remembered the murder a while back when that man's body turned up along the Parkway with a single bullet hole between the eyes.

“The Glady Fork Case. Of course I remember, on account of how it scared more 'n a few tourists,” Sly chuckled. He stopped when Moe's face drew tighter into a frown. Sly cleared his throat.

“I've been looking at the files, and I've triple checked, Sly, I've checked a million times...” Moe trailed off, looking intently at his friend.

“Well, come on! Spit it out, now!” Sly grew impatient, eager to hear what upset his former partner so much.

“I say I've triple checked the results, Sly, but—well, see for yourself.” He put the files he was holding onto the desk and pushed them towards Sly. Sly opened them and began to read. After a moment, he looked up with a shocked look on his face.

“I didn't want it to be true, old friend,” continued Moe quietly. These words would haunt Sly throughout the night, as he researched the case and did everything he could to prove to himself that his brother was innocent--but no, all evidence pointed to Lincoln. Moe had the courtesy to tell Sly so he could bring him in quietly. 

Now Sly was on that very path, driving up a road that seemed long on regular days, but like a cross-country trip this time. He had called Lincoln at 6 AM this morning, to tell him they needed to talk. Lincoln had given a one word reply after a long pause. He must have sensed the dread in Sly’s voice. Sly thought of May and the boys and how they would react upon finding out that their father was a murderer.

Honks of a car brought Sly out of his trance. He was stopped at a stop sign. Looking around, it wasn’t hard to spot where the honks were coming from, as there was only one other car on the road. Catty-corner to Sly was an old blue truck, with hands waving furiously out the window. It took Sly a while to realize who it was. When he did, his heart sank and his eyes grew wide. May had gotten out of her truck, still running with the hazards on, and ran across the backwoods intersection to Sly’s window. Sly suddenly realized his cigarette had been puffed to oblivion. He quickly put it in his ashtray and rolled down his window, taking care to hide his nervousness with a big smile.

“Sly! If it ain’t!” May took a couple breaths as she came up to the window.

“Well, how you doin’, Ms. May?” The genuine tone of Sly’s voice surprised himself.

“How funny to see you here! Didn’t you hear me honking at you like a maniac?” She smiled and pinched his arm that was resting against the window space. Sly started to stumble over an excuse, but May interrupted. 

“Good Lord, your car looks a mess. And why do you still have that radio going?” Her words brought Sly’s attention to the static playing in his car. He hurried to turn it off and grinned out an excuse. She asked where he was going and he replied that it was just a short trip to visit Lincoln. May was surprised that Lincoln didn’t mention it, but that must be why he pushed them out of the house.

“He’s always had such a soft spot for his little brother!” She winked and pinched his arm again. Sly let out a nervous laugh. The boys, still in the truck, began calling out the window. There was a polite “hi Uncle Sly” before howls for their mama to come back overtook the quiet mountain morning. May rolled her eyes, wished Sly a “see you later” after asking about his wife, and ran back to her car. As she pulled away, she honked a couple more times and all three waved.

Sly ran his hand over his face and let out a sigh of relief. He drove on. Five more minutes and he reached the driveway to Lincoln’s property. He paused a little longer than normal before turning in.

Lincoln watched from his window as the telltale dust came up from between the trees, telling of a car on the dirt driveway leading to the garage. He checked his watch again. 6:47 AM, and about the time he was expecting Sly. The phone call this morning has surprised him. He wasn’t sure what Sly was coming to talk about, but he had a feeling he didn’t like. He tried to tell himself there was no way Sly would know--but then again, if anyone did know, it was Sly.

Lincoln seated himself. He pulled his pistol out of his holster, took out the clip, checked the chamber for any rounds, and placed it on the table. He could hear the tires bouncing against the gravel slowing to a stop. Without looking up from the table, he heard a car door open and shut.

CrazyPlato,Cheap_Meals,1389483095.0,"Chili would be perfect. Don't go for meat (expensive), just veggies and beans. You can get a can of beans for around $0.80 each. Get some black or kidney beans, a can of tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, corn, an onion, whatever peppers you want to make it spicy, and a packet of pre-made chili spice from the store. If it's too much, you can take off nearly any of these ingredients and stick to just beans, sauce, and spice. If you're looking for extras, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and crackers are awesome with this.

The best thing is you can freeze the chili and eat it later. Get a bulk pack of sandwich bags, and fill them up with chili. Each bag full should be an almost perfect bowl portion."

* Day cruise to Cayo Costa State Park
* Picnic at Lovers Key State Park
* Walk the boardwalk at Corkscrew Swamp Audubon Sanctuary
* Kayak in Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and eat grouper at one of the local bayou joints
* Sample the nature trails in Big Cypress National Preserve off US-41/Tamiami Trail

Closer to Miami, the drive to Flamingo in Everglades National Park is fantastic and there are a number of short trails off FL-9336/Main Park Road to enjoy. Depending on the time of year, many tropical plants found nowhere else in the continental US will be in bloom. You'll probably see orchids growing out of trees!

In terms of shopping, I honestly just shop at the national chains if affordability is the key criterion. A quick smartphone search shows you're never more than 15-20 minutes from many stores at which you may already shop. If you want to shop at an indie place, many of the beach strips have surf shops and boutiques every several blocks."

If you take your dog for a walk before you let it enter your house, it gives it the opportunity to stretch its legs and be outdoors. More importantly, it can establish you in its mind as the pack leader. Don't let it walk out in front of you, leading the way. Make it walk at your side, always.

Sly walked up to the door and hesitated. He held up his fist to knock and before he could, the door opened. Seeing as his nerves were already high, this made him jump. Lincoln stood at the door, and said not a word. Sly panicked for a moment, his whole plan of what to say forgotten. Both brothers were unsure of what the other knew, making the first words out of anyone’s mouth that much more important. To Sly, Lincoln seemed bigger than normal. He was always taller with broad shoulders, but he seemed especially so now. Lincoln broke the tension.

“Well, come on in then.” He stepped back to allow room for Sly to enter. Sly entered, taking careful note of his surroundings. He noticed the gun and it made him nervous. Lincoln invited him to sit, but Sly declined. They stood in the room, facing each other, for a few seconds before Sly decided to speak.

“Is it true?” He had so many more questions, but this was all he could muster to say. At the words, Lincoln knew what he meant. His whole body relaxed as he collapsed back into his seat at the table by the window. He didn’t say anything, but stared out the window with a look Sly couldn’t help but term as despair. Sly walked over and sat opposite of his brother, knowing in that moment that Lincoln was indeed guilty. His heart hurt, finally letting go of the hope it had carried from the time he learned the news. Now it was confirmed. His brother, Lincoln, who he looked up to as a child. Lincoln, who married his high school sweetheart and never loved another woman. Lincoln, the brother that kept his family together. Lincoln, who shot a man and killed him.

“Why’d you do it, Lincoln?” Sly asked quietly. Lincoln felt as though a weight were being lifted from his shoulders to not have to keep the secret anymore, but simultaneously as if the world were crashing down around him.

“I--I,” he started, clearing his throat when his voice caught, “I got angry. He--he tricked me and I...I just shot him.” Lincoln broke into tears. Sly felt his eyes watering, but was unable to process fully what he was hearing.

“Dear God,” Sly whispered, hand over his chest, feeling as though it might actually break.

“I’m so sorry, brother,” Lincoln managed.

“Does--does May no? Or the boys?”

“No! No, they don’t know nothing about it.” Lincoln wiped his tears and became very firm in this moment. “They don’t know nothing, Sly, you gotta promise me ain’t nothing going to happen to them.”

“Okay, alright.” Another moment passed in silence. Sly pointed at the gun on the table. “Is this the one?” Lincoln nodded. Sly stood up. Lincoln did too.

“Is it time?” Lincoln asked, holding his hands in front of him. “I’m ready.”

“Dear God,” Sly said again, grabbing his brothers arms. “I’m not going to cuff you, Lincoln. Let’s go in together. I’ll just bring you down, we’ll get you a good lawyer, and everything will be alright.” Sly felt the tears now. Lincoln nodded, distraught. Sly put his arm behind his brother and walked them out to the car. He sat Lincoln inside and joined him in the other. Before Sly started to drive down the mountain to the County Jail, Lincoln cleared his throat and put his hand on Sly’s shoulder.

“I want you to know I love you, brother, and I know what I done ain’t worth no help from you--but can you promise me something?” Lincoln looked at Sly with a face more serious than he’d ever seen. He nodded slowly. Lincoln let out a breath of relief. “Could you--could you be the one to tell May and the boys?”

Sly nodded again and put the car in gear.

- - - -

Sly walked into the conference room with two coffees. May sat at the far end of the table. She was puffing anxiously on a cigarette. Her legs were crossed and she was shaking her foot. When Sly entered, she stood. Her eyes were red.

“You can’t smoke in here, May,” Sly said carefully. She scoffed at him.

“Don’t tell me what to do, you goddamned son of a bitch.” The pain in her voice was clear. She was at the point in her sorrow where everything was infuriating. The shock had worn off and she was left having to face the situation. Sly held out a hand with a coffee. May stared at him for a second before taking it. She sat back down. “What’s going to happen to him?”

“I don’t know, May, he’s talking to the lawyers now. It’s a difficult situat--”

“Difficult situation?” She laughed. “Fuck you, Sly.”

“May, take it easy for a minute.” Sly regretted the words as soon as they came out. May stood up with more fury than he’d ever known she could possess and smacked the coffee he had given her off the table.

“Don’t you goddamned tell me what to do! You ruined him! Your own brother. You had the information for what? A day? And you believed that sick son of a bitch--what’s his name--Moe? How could you, Sly!” Her anger started to break down back to pure sorrow. Sly took a step toward her cautiously, his heart feeling like it couldn’t take any more of this pain.

“He confessed, May.” She hit him in the arm.

“No! No he didn’t!” She was screaming now. The deputy opened the door. May screamed at him to get out and Sly gently asked him to leave. He whispered back, over May’s sobs, that the boys were here. Sly ran his hand over his face again, and through his hair. He turned back to May.

“May, you have to get it together. The boys are here.” At this, May immediately stopped crying, looking at Sly with her eyes wide.

“What? Why? They were supposed to be at my sister's--why are they here?” Tears began to flow again. “What am I going to say?”

“Sheriff Redmont?” The deputy opened the door and before he could stop them, Lincoln’s two little boys barged in the room. Upon seeing their mother cry, the youngest instantly started joined her in tears, although he had no idea what was going on. The older boy ran to her side.

“Mama? Mama, what’s going on? Where’s Daddy?”"

You are talking about push back from trans people and allies for suggesting the position above, so let me see if I can explain it to you.


So you can change the mind(well not right now, but let's pretend that is possible) or you can change the body. In both cases the end goal and result is having the person feel more comfortable in their body. People change their bodies all the time from tattoos and piercings to boob jobs and plastic surgery, and yes even grs. Changing the body is nothing new, it's worked out to be pretty safe, and it gets to the end result.

Changing the mind however is a little weird(still pretending, it doesn't actually exist/work). The problem with changing the mind is that you can't be sure that the person is really the same afterward. The mind is more or less who we are as people, and many see mucking around with that as destroying who we were and replace us with someone else. After all, do you consider yourself your mind, or do you consider yourself your arm or chest or genitals?"

Diagonaldog,politics,1389484348.0,"I would say they'd get, say 10-25% less than what they got for the first child, with a further decrease in support for any continued children. If they want to keep having children, it should be their problem, not everyone's. I'm not saying abandon them entirely, what I'm saying is reducing incentive to have further children when you have already proven you can't support the ones you have. 

""let them starve, force adoption / sterilization / abortion?""

Really? Do you have to use such charged words to try and paint me as a poor-hating asshole? 

They are letting themselves starve. If you already have multiple children, and admit not being able to support them (i.e. signing up and receiving government benefits to do so) and then continue to engage in behavior that creates children (i.e. unprotected sex. This would not exclude mothers of rape produced children, as that was not their choice)

Wouldn't incentivized adoption maybe be more preferable? Say, agreeing to find suitable parents and adopt your child to them could result in increased received benefits per current child for a certain amount of time to help recover expenses related to the pregnancy?

If the mother was interested in having her tubes tied, a plan that could cover this expense for them would likely be less expensive than continued support of further children while allowing her to maintain her lifestyle. This would be offered, but not suggested (unless inquired) or in any way ""forced"" or mandated.

Abortion coverage could be similarly applied, ideally within the first few weeks. This could be part of a general program of making contraceptives available, possibly even incorporating a sex education course to qualify for further assistance.

I'm not trying to punish people here, at a certain point you need to grow up and take control of your life though, you can't just always rely on someone else to pay your way. I think most people who have 3+ children while being on welfare since the first would fall under that category."

One thing I notice about your relationship with her is that you both seemed to have different ideas of where you wanted the relationship to go. You want to get a Ph.D and get more qualifications for your career before ""settling"" with a job, and she wants to have a provider now and not later. Obviously this isn't a complete incompatibility, but it causes friction.

Sorry to hear about the medical problem in regards to sex. Sounds like you had it worked out with her. I wouldn't worry too much about what a next girl might think about it -- it doesn't sound like a huge issue to me. There are lots of ways to show affection and pleasure a woman as I'm sure you know, and it sounds like you're also able to do some sexual positions still. That doesn't sound like it would be a deal breaker for most reasonable people.

I know how it feels to have your heart ripped out and lose a best friend. It sucks. I'm going through the same process. There's nothing I can say to ease the pain. Unfortunately, in life things change and people change as they go through it. She changed, you changed, the relationship changed. Don't feel like it's your fault for changing or her fault for changing, just accept it as an immutable fact about the universe. God, if you feel like crying when you think about it, go and find somewhere alone and cry it out. It's understandable. Other people have gone through it and things will be okay.

My suggestion to you would be to focus more on advancing your school/career, if for nothing else just to get your mind off of your girl. (Improving that GPA is good, too.) Perhaps start writing in a diary to collect your thoughts, especially regarding your career. You seem to be feeling ambivalent about your career choice, so it's good to think more about it and become firm about whichever way you go.

One of my friends is a 25 year old male with a BS in biology who's back in college for a BS in physics. He's already gotten one offer to work in a biophysics job for great pay. Maybe you could go a similar route by combining two interests of yours. Whatever you do, just make sure you're sure about your decision and do whatever you need to do to prepare for it.

You're leading a good life and you're successful. There's nothing that can take away the pain of losing someone you love, but you're definitely not a failure. Over time you will be back on your feet academically and emotionally, all it takes is effort and patience. Good luck to you, man."

That being said, if you want to move forward with your date, it may be best not to directly oppose her in those moments. Again, not saying to just roll over and let her trash-talk men the whole night, but perhaps try to change the subject, deflect onto something else. She said something dumb; we all do that sometimes. She's also trying online dating for a reason: she may not be very comfortable with dating either, and could say the wrong thing by mistake. Let it go just the one time, so that you can try to enjoy your date. If she keeps it up, she may not be the kind of girl you want to be around anyway.

If you really want to push back, maybe reverse the situation. If she makes a ""that's what men do"" comment, maybe stick a ""that's what women do"" comment into the conversation later.

NotSoSlenderMan,drunk,1389484793.0,I've never had sailor Jerry but I really like cruzan. And castillo. It's cheap rum that I could drink from the bottle. Kraken is like 94proof. even 2oz of it mixed with coke and you can really tatste the alcohol. I love it because of the branding but it too strong for a rum imo. a few months ago I would've sang it's praises. But I need something milder so I can get drunk faster. well I guess not *faster* but easier. It's still a decent spiced rum to have around and maybe theres a punch or cocktail it works in. But not a good rum to drink neat or straight. which might be the same thing. Idk. I'm drinking Bacardi Pineapple Fusion mixed with Mountain Dew Fruit Punch Kickstart and its' fucking amazing.

farfromhome9,LawSchool,1389484892.0,"There are a ton of bad reasons to go to or stay in law school - your parents thought it was a good idea, you want to be rich, you want the prestige that comes with a law degree, you had nothing else better to do, etc. In my experience, there are comparatively few good reasons to go to law school, namely that you really love the law and you want to work hard. 

Don't waste three years of your life going through the motions just for your dad. If you don't like law school now, it is unlikely to magically become easy and fulfilling in the future. Find something you really love to do, and focus on that. Law school is miserable enough for those who are good students, but worse for struggling students who graduate without a chance in hell of finding a job. That's the most depressing scenario of all - putting yourself through three miserable years of law school, only to find you're either doomed to be unemployed for a long while or will find a job that you will likely hate and leave in a few years anyway. 

My advice as to your dad is to come up with a plan. Think about what you want to do instead of law school and present it to him at the same time you tell him you want to leave law school. For example, ""Dad, I've decided that law school isn't for me, and I think I would do better with a business degree. I'm looking into graduate programs and plan on applying to one soon."" That way hopefully your decision to leave (if it ends up going that way) will be well thought through and you've already got a plan for what you'll do instead. "

vorpalblab,explainlikeimfive,1389485093.0,"I ain't super intelligent but the Stanford-Binet measurements I did for MENSA said 145, and when I was in school I was tested during an episode of depression which troubled the authorities due to my poor attention and behavior stuff. The answer (137) must have puzzled them as well. They assigned me to the slow class for remedial work.

So how good is my memory? Not so hot if I hear it at a lecture or on a video, or during a sales pitch on the phone or in the store. But if I have read it I can remember it pretty reliably almost word for word, and where it was on the page. Even years later.

Separating sheep from goats: At age ten I started to seriously read. About ten books a week. Call it 350 books a year to be conservative. I maintain an average reading of about that number what with the library, the Internet and so forth. I have now been reading extensively for 60 years. I read at 1000 words a minute which is expensive in the number of books per hour?

Do the math and I have read by now the equivalent of 21000 books. And my recall of the contents is good.

So it seems I know a lot. Because I am also curious and dig for answers.

Here's the rub. 

IQ tests measure several things and give adjusted weight to all of them.

One factor is your age, so what you know by a certain age, and what you can figure out by that age is a decent measure of your awareness of what goes on around you and what your education should have exposed you to- including math and analytic skills.

These items measure how your ability increases with age. 

Brain development does not finish until late teens and some mental skills keep developing past that age. 

Curiosity - (what you learn beyond your curriculum) - makes for better vocabulary and is a sign of superior intelligence when combined with enough caution to remain alive.

So memory and intelligence as measured by those tests is correlated.

Do intelligent people just remember more?

Nope. They can recall more than the average joe, but the amount of clutter in the brain is a lot more than what the average joe has so it just appears like they can recall more.

My ability to analyse depends on what it is. I am hopeless with higher math and equations. I am very good at shapes and spaces and make good dough doing arty stuff. I also write well, clearly and creatively.

This is first (and only) draft and not an example of either good writing or creativity by the way."

capughe,keto,1389485279.0,"&gt;I know I could just add fat by using more oil in cooking the chicken but that's also going to up my total calories (trying to stick to 1260) and I'm afraid that if I cut back on the chicken I'll still be hungry.

Fat should keep you fuller for longer than just lean protein so I think this might help. If you're talking skinless chicken breast, try going for skin-on thighs instead.

Like others have said, fat up them veggies. I noticed you only listed your lunch time salad. I would suggest you eat some veggies with dinner and/or breakfast. Broccoli, asparagus, spinach and green beans would be my go-tos. Sautee them in butter, bacon grease, or coconut oil.

Add some more fat in your salad dressing maybe? For example add some bacon grease to your ranch. That sounds good to me anyway.

I see you like cheese. Are you picking one with a good amount of fat in it?

Bullet proof coffee is a good suggestion too (as others have said), I haven't gotten into that myself.

Neiltheslayer,Fitness,1389485299.0,"&gt; micro weights

Generally, the smallest standard barbell weights are 2.5lb each. Which means you need to add 5lbs to the lift everytime you want to increase it. Microweights come in smaller increments, and allow you to make, say, a 2.5lb increase (2 1.25lb weights). If you are using some kind of machine, it may not have this ability, or may require something creative to add the 2.5lbs.

&gt; Chikfila, like 2 plain chicken sandwiches and a small fries.

Sounds alright to me, as long as it fits your macros. Macros being: the % breakdown of your total calories consumed for each of the 3 macro nutrient categories (protein, fat, carbohydrates). There are calculators for this, too. It's reccomended to get 1g of protein per pound of lean body mass per day (body weight * (100% - body fat %) grams of protein).

&gt;  I don't order soft drinks

Good, they are mostly worthless. Diet soft drinks are ok every now and then.

&gt; What's TDEE?

I think it stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure? It's the number of calories you burn on an average day, and is based on your height, weight, gender, and activity levels. There are calculators out there for it.

&gt; What's a realistic weight goal, in say 3 months?

Depends how hard you're trying to go. I would say, eat in such a way that you gain at the rate of .5lb/week. Make sure you are pushing yourself hard at the gym, though, and getting proper amounts of sleep. This will maximize the % of that gain that is muscle mass.

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389485587.0,"To add on to this, Sharon was not a stranger to controversy over the deaths of civilians.  He was the one leading unit 101 during the [Qibya massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibya_massacre), in which a large number of civilians were killed in an assault on a border village following cross-border attacks in 1953.  The two important differences were that Qibya involved IDF troops directly doing the killing, and that it achieved an actual military objective.  There wasn't an official inquiry there, but the unit in question was disbanded afterwards.

&gt;But let me be totally clear: Israel holds a direct responsibility for what happened in Sabra and Shatila and there are some very damning pieces of evidence that imply that members of the Israeli government and IDF were well aware of what was going to happen beforehand, most notably Ariel Sharon.

Well...that depends on how you define ""indirect"".  I'm not sure allowing someone else to do something makes the responsibility direct.

&gt;As for sources, should I just upload my Bachelor's thesis? It's not in English, though.

Say youre doing it for X, Y, and Z reasons and you are not trying to make anyone else follow this. If they ask more questions, just answer them, make sure to have any facts on hand that you need. if they dont, then yorue good. just say exactly what you need to, and nothing more.

3. slowly. i know people have differing opinions but i think a smooth transition is much easier than stopping cold turkey. im moving into a vegan diet right now, i gave up milk, then butter. next is cheese then eggs.

4. its never been a big deal, prepping dinner together is a tad different, like cooking the meat differently, but ive never actually had a problem with it. do you have specific part of the relationship you arent sure about? specific questions might help us help you more.

5. not at all. its a big change, especially in most countries which arent very veggie friendly. just make sure you start learning to cook veggie meals because trust when i say no one else will know how to. Reach out to that one veggie friend you have and say you are interested, i promise no matter how much shit you gave her she will be happy to help. its always nice to have someone you can be a veggie with.

6. i know this wasnt part of your questions but im adding it, its about getting shit. its going to happen, a lot. as a male vegetarian i get everything from getting my manhood being called into question to people think im going to die. just ignore it, its just a generic argument they make to try and make themselves feel less guilty about their choices. i do martial arts, shoot guns, shave with a cut-throat razor, and build combat robots, but im a pussy because i dont eat meat, go figure."

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389487546.0,"&gt;Essentially, I'd talk about all the science/coolness/wonder of being a medical physician without actually using the word ""doctor"". 

A lot of what's cool about doctors is that they heal people, not just that they know a lot about the human body. People develop relationships with their doctors that they don't with the other staff at medical establishments, which means that over time they start to see doctors differently. People trust doctors. Medical doctors are seen as dealing with people, not just their bodies. They are also more educated than orderlies and the like, and as such make the actual connections between information. It becomes both more interesting and more relatable for those reasons. If you're saying that you assist nurses and run blood tests, then you're leaving out a lot of the perceived coolness and wonder of the medical profession.

I'm not ruling out status or money, but there are many other reasons for someone to find your profession interesting. You are, in my opinion, being paranoid."

GeneralShivers,AskMen,1389487736.0,"1. We don't know that she's lazy. She agreed to the situation as it is, but that doesn't imply an unwillingness to change it given the change in circumstances.

2. It is my view that she *should* get a shitty job and start saving to take care of herself. However, the reality of the situation is that a shitty job won't allow her to have enough to pay rent, a down deposit, a method of transportation, food, other utilities, etc right away. And if she doesn't have a job, it is likely that she hasn't been building credit (and thus will not be able to get private loans for school.) And at least until age 25, financial aid REQUIRES the financial information of a parent/guardian. If this dude is as successful as he says and has been taking care of her, school is going to say that he is required to invest a portion of his income anyway. (Happened to me, although the dude happened to be my dad, who stiffed me on an $8000 dollar bill. Funny part was that I have had my own job and been taking care of myself for 3 years now. They still said my dad owed.)

And lets remember that none of the situations in #2 are going to be helped by her being homeless if he kicks her out right away. His obligation is to keep a roof over her head (in a roommate type situation) until she has had a chance to work her ass off and get something to provide herself with. It is not condoning laziness in any manner at all to say that he has that obligation for reneging on the commitment that the both of them agreed to."

Avistew,polyamory,1389488085.0,"Polyamory is considered to be either a relationship orientation (where the polyamorous person can have feelings for more than one person at a time, without ""choosing"" one) or a relationship description (where the polyamorous person has or may have more than one partner at the same time, openly).

It can be casual, or it can be committed (so, ranging from something close to dating around, to something more like polygamy, whether people choose to use the term or not).

It can range from completely open (sleeping around/ dating other people is fine, even without any sort of warning, on the spur of the moment), to completely exclusive (fidelity, sexual and emotional, is expected between the current partners).

It usually involves sex, but there are asexual polyamorists are well.

A polyamorous group, sometimes called polycule, can be made of people who are all dating one another, or are only dating some of the people in the group (sometimes only one of them).

There is a broad range in polyamory and almost every polyamorous person is in a different situation, and would use a slightly different definity for what it means to be polyamorous. But I hope I gave you some idea of the range of it, and that it's clearer for you."
