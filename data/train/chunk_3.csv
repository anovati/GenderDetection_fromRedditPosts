I have had a kelty backpack for years and the only thing that has worn out is the elastic in the side pockets  (they still work, just not as good for tall bottles).  This is not the exact same model, but it should fit your needs."
POGtastic,news,1388707466.0,"1 . Women have been in the military in some shape or form since the 1950s. This article was written in the late 2000s, and the problems he describes from his tours in the 90s are still rampant. It doesn't really have much to do with adjustment problems that diminish over time like racial integration; it's that women are mostly exempt from all of the discipline issues that are customary in the military.

2 . Take a group of people. In the military, we go by the 10-80-10 rule. 10% of people are irredeemable shitbags who need to be kicked out ASAP. They're garbage, toxic to others, and no amount of mentoring or instruction will convince them to change their ways. 10% of people are consummate professionals who constantly try to do the right thing even when no one is looking. The other 80% are somewhere in between. Military discipline (and workplace management in general) is about getting that 80% to do what they're told. Incidentally, I'm in the 80%. I'm above average, but I'm above average because I have a great boss who drives me to succeed. If I had a shitty boss, I'd be a shitbag.

That 80% is a product of the command. If the command holds them accountable, they do good things. If the command sucks ass, then they'll shirk their duty and be lazy. Unfortunately, the command has far fewer tools when it comes to women. As a result, they skate.

I'm good at dealing with men who think they can skate on duty. They find out very quickly that their lives are going to suck and act accordingly. Some of them are part of the 10%, and their initial fuck-ups are a sign of things to come. The rest of them smarten up and start working. Some of them even take pride in it and become excellent leaders.

What I'm basically saying is that in a perfect world, everyone would act like adults and do what they need to do. Unfortunately, it's more complicated than that. People respond to incentives, and doing the right thing is not always the easiest thing. Military discipline is supposed to make the right thing easy by making every other option painful. Unfortunately, it's more difficult to apply military discipline to women.

3 . Thanks to a certain organ that sucks up all blood flow that should normally go to the brain, men suck at dealing with women in the workplace. It's not just the military; HR departments everywhere have all sorts of fun dealing with sexual harassment, sexual assault, preferential treatment, and general asshattery. In turn, there are women who (being part of the 80%) take advantage of opportunities that are presented to them. The gunny's willing to let me skip out on sandbag duty? Well, filling sandbags sucks and he's willing to let me go because I'm a woman. Sweet.

I don't know how to solve this. Prostitution would do a little, (Good luck passing that with attitudes on prostitution the way they are) but unfortunately there are men who take advantage of their positions of power, and there are women who are attracted to men in power. You can't beat human nature. It takes two to tango, and both parties like to dance regardless of how bad dancing is.

4 . In the past, no one really cared what you did with your juniors as long as you got the job done. If I were in the military 30 years ago, I would be dealing with insubordination with ""wall-to-wall counseling"" (an ass-kicking). Due to people being idiots, the command has clamped down on things considerably with new hazing policies and increased vigilance toward people who mistreat their subordinates. The problem, of course, is that in a job like the military, people generally respond much better to pain instead of paperwork, and the new policies make it very dangerous for NCOs to actually enforce discipline. Some people quite frankly need their asses kicked if you want them to do what they're told. As a man, I'm able to read my juniors and figure out which ones are willing to accept pain and which ones just need to get busted down and kicked the fuck out. I just can't do it with women.

One last thing - Kratman isn't saying that women don't have a place in the military. He's saying that their presence opens up a massive amount of problems, and that we need to think about things instead of just going ""Everyone's equal yay equality let's dooo it"" while stifling all dissenting views and labeling them as sexist. Also, the Norse and Celt women were in strictly defensive militia roles. They didn't fight in invasions, and they were not given the same demands that are placed on soldiers who deploy to other countries."

Derailing is a big problem in this sub, but I don't think the men doing it realize that they're doing it. They're used to the conversations in most subs they subscribe to being about them, so they just get into the habit of talking about themselves. They aren't terrible people, but they are being rude. Invalidating someone else's experience (by telling them, often literally, ""No, that is not your experience, let me tell you what your experience actually is"") is not the same thing as sharing opinions. Neither is simply steering the conversation around to yourself or a topic you know about. A common example is when a woman here talks about the experience of being hit on and a man tells her to stop complaining because she doesn't know how hard it is to hit on someone and he would love to be hit on once in a while so she has nothing to complain about. Or just responds to her conversation with a long rant about how hard it is to ask people out in general. That is not discourse, it's derailing.

It's a fine line that ought to be pointed out. There are more men than women on reddit, which means it takes a much lower percentage of men screwing this up before you've drowned out the female voices and/or steered women away from participating altogether. That's part of why there's a lower tolerance for it here.

And I don't know that these subs technically are for discussion between the sexes. AskWomen is a place for women to offer their opinions or experiences in response to questions asked. AskMen is a place for men to do the same."

Ed - **None** - Actually I'm not convinced that Ed would have had any type of mental disorder, since over all he seemed to be happy with what he was doing at most any point in time, he doesn't rely on the other kids for validation, he just has fun with whatever he and the other Eds are doing, and he seems better tolerated than the other two Eds.

Edd AKA Double D - **Generalized Anxiety Disorder/ Social Anxiety** - Edd is smart, brilliant even, and yet he is unable to deal with situations he perceives as embarrassing. He is easily frazzled, and finds solace in more solitary pursuits. 


Eddy - **Narcissistic Personality Disorder** - Eddy is defined by his obsession with money, and his willingness to do anything to get it. More than that though, he has a self image that screams 'Napolean,' to anyone who watches the show for more than ten minutes. Eddy is obsessed with this image of himself as one of the cool kids, and everyone else is a loser. He has delusions of grandeur, and feelings of persecution when things don't go his way (it's never his fault that something failed, you'll notice). I'm not sure why, but while his behavior is slightly antisocial, I wouldn't diagnose Antisocial Personality Disorder, simply because he does care what people think of him, and can feel remorse.

StuHardy,WritingPrompts,1388708302.0,"""Oh, for the love of Sol, will you please shut up?""

""What's the matter? Is the fact you doomed humanity a bit upsetting towards me?""

""Look, Clytemenestra was considered sterile long ago. I know medical tests have come along leaps and bounds in our need to survive, but sometimes nature still wins. She cannot have children. The generations stop. It's...it's all over. 7 million years of pan-universal travel... for nothing.""

Agamemnon slumped back against the operating table. Clytemenestra was beginning to revive from the operation. Anaxbia, Agamemnon's sister, resigned herself and buried her head into her hands. The generational ship had survived civil war, solar diseases and the Cult of One Direction. But it all came down to the numbers. There needed to be at least 180 biologically different humans in order to prevent inbreeding. Now, there were only 179. One may not seem the difference, but with 13.05 million Earth-years of travel remaining, inbreeding would corrupt the biology of humans. If - and it was a big if - the inhabitants of the ship survived, they would no-longer be human. Just a scar of what humanity once was.

""So, should we just start having sex now, or wait for our respective grandchildren to start?"" Anaxbia asked sarcastically.

""Oh, will you please SHUT THE FUCK-""

""**UP!**"" roared Clytemenestra, fully moving once more.

""Oh Sol,"" Agamemnon moved over to his wife. ""How do you feel?""

""I feel...empty,"" she responded. ""I guess... we cannot have the future we wanted?""

""No, my beloved. It appears we cannot.""

She pulled her husband closer and clutched him tightly, sobbing into his shoulder. He held his nerve as long as he could, before breaking down himself.

""I'm just glad that the radio signals are down...they wouldn't be able to hear us on Earth now."" Clytemenestra said between the sobs.

""Wait...what was that?""

""The radio signals?""

""Yes...yes, yes, YES! Oh, you are a genius!""

Agamemnon kissed his wife, then ran out of the room. Rolling her eyes, Anaxbia followed him.

""Care to clue us in on what you have planned?""

""The radio signals!""

""There are none to or from Earth, you idiot!""

""True, but I'm not trying to contact Earth. I'm trying to contact the Seeker ship!""

""And what good would that do?""

""If we can track it's radio trajectory, we can find its location on Gaia.""

""We know its location, it's what we and our ancestors have been following all this time.""

""I'm talking about its planetary location. It's exact co-ordinates on the planet's surface.""

""And what in the name of Jupiter will that accomplish?""

""It'll give the engines a location.""

""No it wo- oh Sol, tell me you didn't-""

""It was a contingency plan.""

""You fitted the ship with a *Faster-Than-Light* ***Warp Drive?!?***""

""I did what had to be done!""

""The reason the seeker ship had an FTL warp was because everything inside it was mechanical i.e. not living, meaning nothing **burned to death** from the massive energy output the drive gave off when it travelled to the **FUCKING ANDROMEDA GALAXY, 2.4 SEXTILLION FUCKING MILES AWAY!!!**""

""We have been studying FTL for more than 700 years, we've been able to fine tune it-""

""Look me in the eye and tell me this is going to be safe. Tell me that we will survive the output the drive makes, and all will be right.""

Agamemnon paused, and looked his sister dead in the eye. ""I guarantee that if we just float here, there is nothing of worth anyone can do. Our history will die, our species will die and our future will die unless we do something. This is that something. So what do you choose - certain death, or possible death?""

Anaxbia stood still, silent. Eventually, she let out a sigh. She knew her brother was right. ""Possible.""

""Good. Call the populace, I'll be executing Royal order 251.""

""What's that?""

""If I'm wrong, I'll abdicate.""

""What will be left to abdicate?""

""That the beauty of this royal order; I get to say it's in the name of their King - just this once - and it will be obeyed.""

""The people will not stand for it, my King.""

""The people won't have a choice.""

And so, Anaxbia called the population. She told them to be with loved ones, hold each other close and pray to Sol herself all would be well. Agamemnon held his wife, knowing that this act could spell the immediate death of the remains of human life. With Royal order 251, the FTL Warp drive was activated, and with a light as bright as a supernova, their ship disappeared from space."

I was taught all the ""boy stuff"" (mostly sports and fishing) by my dad and I learned how to do the girly stuff too (laundry, mending, cooking), but more because I didn't want to be helpless than because I had to as a girl. If I ever did something that was really boy-like or very girly, I would always be chided by the parent of the opposite gender.

The only time gender roles were strict was the lengths to which my mother went to guard my virginity. There were lots of strict curfews and rules and my mother made no attempt to hide the fact that they wouldn't apply if I were a boy. The [horrid] justification was that ""Boys only want one thing. They will manipulate you and deceive you to get it and they'll leave once they do.""

In the end I have interests that span the gender spectrum, but mostly clump around the middle. I spent most of my teen years really angry at my parents because of their sexist rules and that probably kick-started my feminist/progressive tendencies.

It can be changed to consider the bias of women talking about romantic relationships in general once films start to pass more consistently, but for now and for such an easy test to pass, it's telling that a lot of movies don't pass it.  I'm not trying to say that every film needs to pass, or that it is relevant to every genre, but the widespread failure is just something that doesn't need to be happening with such an easy test.

I'm not even saying it shows any sign that a genre may or may not be sexist, horror traditionally does a great job of passing the test, but that doesn't mean that horror movies still don't have strange trends in their depictions of women."

PlushieChomby,childfree,1388708981.0,"Wow. I typed 2,000 characters out and accidentally refreshed the page. I might cry a little. 

Round two, here goes: I'll bite, and try my best to explain things from my point of view, though please feel free to ask questions if I don't provide total clarity on what I believe on the subject. I also apologize in advance for the length. :) 

First of all, I'm a ""Christian"", though I fall pretty far from the average tree. I despise what the term has come to mean, and view it as a far cry from the ""little Christ"" meaning that Romans used to mock the early church. Organized religion has done and continues to do a great deal of harm (and a great deal of quieter, less publicized good, I'll admit) to the world around us, which is pretty much the opposite of what I believe Jesus intended. Rather I follow in my father's footsteps, believing religion to be deeply personal and devoting myself to attempting to walk the walk rather than spewing the talk at others, only talking about my faith when I'm asked, like in this instance. 

That said, I'm probably not your target audience, since churches tend to make me nauseous and sad, but since I fall into the religious category I thought I'd answer anyway. 

Honestly, it sounds like your Christian friend believes in a tiny little powerless god by that statement, and I completely disagree with the sentiment that God couldn't have accounted for *anything*, much less how much we multiplied. Then again, I believe God exists outside of the space-time continuum, and it would therefore be impossible for It to *not* know exactly what would take place, beginning, end and everything in between. 

Galatians 5:13-14 is one of many passages I've always liked, stating, ""You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"" Mark 12:31 even says, ""The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."" 

Needless to say, I spend a lot of time examining my actions in light of these verses, and others along the same lines. Am I behaving lovingly toward others, especially when they upset me? Am I patient when tried? Am I kind even in the face of ugliness? Do I feel envy or pride? Did I boast or dishonor anyone? Were my actions self-seeking? Have I been easily angered recently? Am I holding any grudges? Am I seeking out good and uplifting where I can, or am I commiserating and celebrating bad things happening to people who seem to deserve it? Am I embodying the values in both mind and action that I value so much? 

As someone who tries her hardest to do as little harm to and as much good for the world around me and the people inhabiting it that I can, it's simpler than you might think to boil down why I don't want to bear children. Yes, at points in history, human survival has been a concern. We are undeniably not at that point now. Thanks to modern science and technology, we no longer have to fear that one family will pump out twelve kids and only two will survive to adulthood. I'm sure it still happens, but it's nowhere near the scale it was before soaps and medicines and treatments that actually work came along. Hell, now we're at the point where your body doesn't even have to do the work to survive it once had to do. We have machines that will push blood through your veins for you, breathe for you, clean your kidneys, even flip you so your body doesn't suffer severe atrophy... the list goes on, while both expected lifespans and populations increase drastically. 

Meanwhile, mother earth has trouble supporting all her inhabitants. In just over 200 years, we went from 1 billion people to 7 billion people worldwide. That is fucking insanity. Earth has kept the majority of us alive so far, but the scars of our rapid multiplication are more visible with every generation. Reason One for my not wanting to have children would be that I'd like to not contribute to that scarring. Multitudes of other people will breed and I'm only a drop in the ocean, but it's one small, loving act to which I can readily commit myself: not hurting others by not contributing to the problem. Loving the people around me by denying my ability to produce other mouths to feed and feet to trample and little carbon dioxide producing machines. 

The second reason is this, my favourite verse in the entire compilation of books the councils of Laodicea and Carthage decided comprised the New Testament canon: James 1:27, ""Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."" That's it: two things that both fall easily under the domain of practicing Real Love: taking care of those who have trouble taking care of themselves, and not losing yourself in a world ready to dilute you. 

I've done just about every kind of volunteer work possible. From suicide hotlines to pregnancy counseling to post-abortion counseling to multiple positions for battered women and children's shelters, from training dogs and cleaning their cages at the local shelters to AIDS walks and office work to visiting the elderly and doing their shopping/bills/taking walks with them, from doing music therapy and throwing parties and playing with children at the local mental hospital, to being a Big Sister and volunteering legal services and building houses with Habitat for Humanity. More than I've listed here, more than you'd care to read, and why? Because it's taking care of people. It's showing Love in a real way. The positions require exercises of patience, kindness, hope, joy... They exercise the things in me which I value and wish to continually grow, and keep me aligned with a very narrow, truly simple definition of the only ""pure and faultless"" religion. Helping the elderly and those in distress? Check. Taking care of orphans or those who might as well be? Check. Teaching adults to read, recording books for the blind... these all fall into the same category as the first two in my mind. I can make an impact, albeit small, on the world around me, by not having children - which allows me an incredible amount of time to make very real differences in the lives of those I can help. It feels more real, more honest, more loving, to take the time I'd otherwise spend training one or two spawn on how to be good people and instead devote it to enriching or positively altering the lives of people already *here*, rather than imaginary future children. 

I could be wrong, but I feel very strongly I'm on exactly the path which was meant to be most ideal for me, the path which spills the most Love into the world around me. Not having kids makes that possible in so many ways having them would limit for me. 

I guess I could have just summarized by saying, I personally think God's quite content, possibly sad about the sheer number of people that already exist on this planet, and is more than fine with my not contributing to the mass of people already here. 

Also, I'm 30, and while I've known for a long time that I don't want to bear children of my own, I can't say beyond a shadow of a doubt that in five or ten years I won't be in a place where adopting an older kid, not a baby or toddler, seems like exactly the right thing to do. I don't like small children, but I'm both a good disciplinarian and had an exemplary standard set by my parents on how to Love, which I've expanded upon greatly in my own studies and behavioral patterns. To be blunt, with over 100,000 children in America and an estimated ***153 million*** orphans worldwide needing adoption, it's incredibly difficult for me to understand how anyone who claims to follow Jesus Christ and wants children could even think of procreating themselves while the world is hurting so badly. I get it, lots of people want their own mini-me, they want to be pregnant or know they can breed, they want a kid from day one with the theory it'll somehow be special or different because they share DNA with it, but it kind of blows my mind how so many people can just skip right over something that seems so obvious to me. 

My aunt, one of only two who didn't pop out kids, was both a Christian and a social worker for decades. Although she was single, she adopted five children ranging from age 12-17 who desperately needed a stable home. I've seen the effects of how her being their rock, even in incredibly difficult circumstances, helped to shape them in amazing ways that I'm not sure would have happened had she not stepped up. She helped them with everything from PTSD to teenage pregnancy to getting them into college and helping them achieve their dreams. When she passed away a few years ago, I got to see all of them again (a few states over) and hear some incredible stories about how she'd permanently touched their lives and shaped their futures. I'd like to think someday I'll grow into being the kind of person my aunt was, but if I'm never in a place where adopting older orphans is viable, I'll still have plenty of time to help in non-parenting, positive influence, distress-relieving ways.... which, when you get right down to it, is what I believe God is asking of me. 

Wow, and I almost hit character limit. Sorry again for the length and I know I rambled a bit there, but it can be difficult knowing how to express things I generally keep to myself. I hope that provided a bit of insight into just this one religious person's view though. As Walt Whitman said, ""Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. (I am large, I contain multitudes.)"" But still, I'd be happy to answer questions if I was unclear or didn't make sense in any way. :)

There's also the fact that, to Summer, Coldhands smells like  ""dead meat, dry blood, a faint whiff of rot. And cold. Cold all over""
So he most likely is rotting, albeit very slowly. Over the course of several thousand years however, even in the freezing climate of the Land Beyond the Wall he shouldn't be much more than bones. Even discarding rot, the Land Beyond the wall isn't a hospitable place. I kind of doubt anything could spend several dozen centuries dodging direwolves, regular wolves, mammoths, superstitious wildlings without taking some damage.

We don't go too deep into the machine because not everyone knows everything about everything and we can teach you what you don't know as we cross that bridge later if you make it. 

Generally we start off with a few easy questions to get your nerves your and let you relax to figure out who you are and then we start to figure out what you know. We will ask you about some of the larger fundamental concepts to programming, ask you about OOP, if and when that is good and evil, Test Driven Development (TDD) and agile and what experience you have with them, we will have you talk about design patterns and previous examples of when and how you have used them. So not very technical at all. Remember, we are interviewing generally people under the age of 40, a lot of college kids without prior experience out of the classroom and of more and more often, contractors. While I could talk for days on what we could do to improve our interview process, it would do me little good (This is just part of our process and the powers that be like it) and it would not do you a lot of good.

I would say that if you have a project, that is great, and bring it up. make sure you review the bigger concepts, and review your design patterns. Can't stress that enough, because that will show your future employer that you are not going to spend their time and your energy reinvent a new wheel for each new thing. Review TDD, as it is getting bigger and bigger in our field and I don't see it going away any time soon.

Surely not an elaborate plan, looping in masses of people. In the mini webisode, he said lies are complicated. Too much detail would reveal he was lying. The solution he outlined to Anderson was complicated.

He only seemed to really know he needed help when he went to Molly, which wasn't that long before the rooftop scene, so the idea that this was all part of a plan that began when Mycroft had Moriarty in custody seems ridiculous. Additionally, he said that 13 potential outcomes were carefully planned for once he lured Moriarty to the roof...really? All 13, with plans, contingencies, and code names? In the thirty seconds it takes to ascend a stairwell?

Again, how doesn't really matter. But rather than wasting a lot of time on fantasy sequences, they could have just summed up the truth and moved on with a meatier story.

I'm also a ""Christian"" who strongly disagrees with the vile hatred he spews, and an individual who both believes in free speech and acknowledges that actions have consequences. I'd rather see him kicked off campus and physically unharmed than put in an I.C.U. by some guy whose girlfriend was raped who decides to turn Dean into a message for hatemongers everywhere. People get kicked out of clubs, cliques, colleges, businesses for less every day, and while I think having a law saying you could remove someone for saying things others don't like would be a bloody disaster in execution, I respect when a large group unilaterally decides to uproot a cancer like Dean. 

After all, as Voltaire said, ""Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities."" Words like Dean's are harmful on multiple levels, and the thought of them reaching someone easily influenced is both sad and terrifying to me. 

On the bright side, holding up those signs makes it pretty clear he's undesirable to the vast majority of the female population, and sometimes you've got to really dig deep to find out someone is that level of messed up. He should be commended for outing himself as being so hateful, but nothing more in my opinion, and while I know we'll have to agree to disagree, I honestly believe the university would be a better place without him clinging to, ""Free speech lets me spread a hateful message!"" on campus every day.

How to fix it? Personally, I take a break. But not a long one, maybe a day, or two at max. I don't do anything for my channel those days (except release a video since mine are done beforehand in batches) I don't check my subs, views, money, or watch any of my videos. I'm in survival mode, I need to re-energize. So I watch some of my favourite playthroughs, the ones that made me want to do LPs to begin with, and then I'll go for a walk or a bike ride and think. Generally before I finish my ride/walk I'm dying to record and want to get home ASAP. 


Here are the videos I use to re-energize (mostly minecraft but y'know, I like it):

irondal2,AdviceAnimals,1388714151.0,"&gt;I'm failing to understand how you think I made any factual claims in the first post. It was an opinion based on the thread title. Please clarify.

You've made no factual claim. This was all after I replied to your 1st post. I wanted cites to theories that counter the theories I posed. Specifically, I wanted reddit to read why my theories are bunk, but I covered that base.

&gt;""When your parental figure disregards authority, and thinks they're cool, it DOES NOT end there.""

That part could've been hyperbole (as was my narcissistic self-reference to the reddit handle I use nowadays). Most people consciously break laws and some laws are in effect that shouldn't be, ones that might've never been good laws. I'm not aiming to assert that I have the better answer to the current legislation, nor do I know everything about proper parenting. 

Aside from all that, one thing I do know after my thirty years of ups and downs is that having a good sense of humor can go a long way. I get it,  oneupmanship can get in the way of a healthful sense of humor, but it should not be the case. To explain what I probably shouldn't have to: A ton of my posts on reddit are tongue-in-cheek, but as we've established, I do try to sprinkle a good theory or two in with all the nonsense I write."

Tashre,nfl,1388714272.0,"&gt; . Wilson is never going to be a gun slinger. Never going to put up 5k yard seasons.

This is a big perception problem with Quarterbacks. To most people, passing is the only thing they're judged by. They go to stat pages and sort by total yards and that's how QBs are ranked. It's not a matter of if a QB is a gunslinger type or not, it's how *much* of a gunslinger they are. So many people go on about how Russell hasn't had a season where he's had to throw it out a lot, but really, why does he need one? A QB is still capable of being great at their position even if one of their stats isn't top tier.

If you've watched a significant number of Hawks games, you will easily be able to see why Russell Wilson is considered a great quarterback due to the way he plays, but if all you're going off of is comparing numbers on paper, you're going to get a completely different story. He isn't wowing anybody with his individual numbers like Manning or Brees, but he easily *is* a significant contributing factor to the success of the offense (as evidenced in the first half the the season)."

The Japanese consider a cup to be 200 mL, or roughly 7.04 fluid ounces.

In my opinion, the *proper* volume of a cup is the metric cup, which is 250 mL, or roughly 8.8 fluid ounces. This makes sense because it can be evenly divided into a litre, has a rounded volume, and is a decent amount of liquid for someone to drink out of a, well, cup."

This story is shit.

&gt;Obamacare tried to ditch those plans for a reason:

Bull.

http://www.propublica.org/article/loyal-obama-supporters-canceled-by-obamacare

Plans were supposed to be grandfathered in... but they ***changed*** the law after it was passed and millions were thrown off of their plans because the insurance companies had no choice.

http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/11/15/21482622-insurers-state-officials-say-cancellation-of-health-care-policies-just-as-they-predicted?lite

&gt;At issue is a so-called “grandfather” clause in the law stating that consumers would have the option of keeping policies in effect as of March 23, 2010,  even if they didn’t meet requirements of the new health care law. But the Department of Health and Human Services then wrote regulations that narrowed that provision, saying that if any part of a policy was significantly changed after that date — the deductible, co-pay, or benefits, for example — the policy would not be grandfathered.

This ACA is a bamboozle designed to fail and lead to single payer.

You ought to know how bad it is from how the president is illegally delaying parts of it until after the next election and giving waivers as favors.

Edit: Okay, here we go. Sorry for taking so long!

Let me start with a note/disclaimer: I am Canadian, not French.

I did [some research](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/search?q=dirty+talk&amp;restrict_sr=on) to find some dirty talk phrases (in English). Of course, the word ""fuck"" is used pretty often. But what's ""fuck"" in French? Well, the [direct translation](https://translate.google.ca/?hl=fr&amp;tab=wT#en/fr/fuck) is ""baise,"" but no one uses that. At least not my generation. There's also ""foutre,"" but that's used in ""va te faire foutre"" (go fuck yourself), so it doesn't really do the trick. We use a lot of English words and expressions, but it's hard to translate. It doesn't have the same meaning, the same connotation.

Here are some other examples with their translation and some explanation.

* Fuck me/fuck me harder/I want you to fuck me/please fuck me

  There's the word! I don't really know how to translate them without using ""baiser"" or ""foutre,"" but you could use ""to make love.""

* Your cock feels so good inside me/in my pussy

  What's ""cock"" in French? ""Penis"" is ""pénis."" There's ""queue"" (tail) and.. there's ""bite"" ([cock](https://translate.google.ca/?hl=fr&amp;tab=wT#fr/en/bite)). If you use ""bite,"" your partner *may* start laughing uncontrollably. ""Queue"" refers to an animal's tail, so that's kind of weird.

  ""Pussy"" and ""cunt"" mean ""chatte"" or ""minou."" This has the same meaning as in English, but I'd still find it funny.

* Fill me up/cum inside me/I want you inside me

  ""Fill me up"" could be translated to ""remplis-moi."" But that's too literal! Do you want to empty her and then fill her up with water or what?! You could say the same thing for the English equivalent, though. For ""cum,"" we say ""venir,"" which means ""to come,"" or ""jouir"" (this one doesn't exactly refer to the act of cumming, but the pleasure you get when you do). ""Cum inside me"": ""viens à l'intérieur de moi,"" or ""viens dedans moi."" Again, that's literal. Also, the wording is weird.

* I want to cum all over your face

  ""Je veux venir/jouir sur ton visage."" This is weird, but it's kind of the same thing as in English.

* You make me so hard/You're so tight/You're so wet for me

  If you say ""you make me so hard"" in French, it sounds like you're *really* hard. Also, it's hard to translate. The [direct translation](https://translate.google.ca/?hl=fr&amp;tab=wT#en/fr/You%20make%20me%20so%20hard.) doesn't make any sense. It could be ""je suis tellement dur pour toi"" (""I'm so hard for you""). ""Wet"" means ""mouiller."" But it really sounds like you have water or some other fluid all over you! ""Tight"" is ""serré,"" but we generally use ""tight"" anyway.

The following terms and phrases have (about) the same meaning in both languages:

* slut, whore, etc. (However, some people might argue that it's more degrading than the same words in English.)

* You're going to cum for me now.

* Tell me what you want

* Beg for (my [something])

Anyway, I don't know where I'm going with this, but here's what you should know:

1. People who try to learn French quickly realize that it's more complicated than English: verbs, syntax, etc. English is simple and short. French is more complicated.

2. English is a Germanic language; French is a Romance language. I won't get into details (because I don't know anything about that haha), but they're different. It's also possible that this has nothing to do with it, though.

3. Like I said, I'm Canadian. The Canadian French language is heavily influenced by the English language (and so does French from France, apparently). We use a lot of English words and expressions. Why would we use French words instead? We sometimes take the word in English and conjugate it in French.

  A given phrase in English can sound great, natural, and all, but the same thing in French can sound forced, too precise, or too literal (and degrading). (Cum, fill me up, etc.)

4. We are ~~maybe~~ probably spoiled by the English language.

  (Personally, I don't like to watch dubbed TV shows or movies. I watch TV shows and movies in English.)

This is less concise than I would've liked, but that's about it.

Bonus: In English, you can *like* something and you can *love* something. It's very different. In French, there's only one word for the two: ""aime/aimer."""

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388716170.0,"Only the official reddit admins and conde nast know for sure but a few basic things:

1:  Apps that duplicate the functionality of a website are essentially redundant.  It's easier to format a website for a mobile device than to write an app, and there's really no functional benefit you can't/shouldn't just offer over the web anyway.

2:  it costs money they don't have, or skills they do not have.  Particularly for android, testing is royal pain in the ass.  You need a lot of devices, screen sizes etc.  Also, like with RES someone else is doing it for free.  

3: 3rd party apps are 'good enough' (reddit feels they get enough out of them already, or that they cannot match the functionality.  This is unlikely for reddit since the front end of reddit and reddit apps are fairly simple, but certainly with other companies dealing with 3rd party scrapers or mods the method of aggregation may have a lot of design variation to it where providing that much choice to users is  hard). 

4: They might be working on one that relies on technology that is not widespread yet.  I'm not really sure what that would be (HTML 5.0 related perhaps, or maybe some database work on the backend maybe).  This doesn't seem like a great reason, but it's worth adding, particularly if you consider there might be some back end tools that require work that we don't see.  "

LyssaBrisby,AskWomenOver30,1388716630.0,"Feeling the need to plan ahead past the point of rational projection is totally a factor of anxiety-driven behaviours (again, I speak from experience). So is catastrophizing: thinking and/or obsessing about the worst possible things, so that you feel like you've prepared yourself for every circumstance, even if that preparation is artificial and unlikely to apply to real-world situations, which are notoriously unpredictable. Posting this thread is possibly part of catastophizing: ""if my 15-year-plan goes off as expected, what about XYZ secondary effect?? MUST RESEARCH!""

It is very familiar to me. ;)

Suggestion. If you do some work in therapy while you're this young, or even by reading some books on anxiety management techniques from the self-help section, that will probably be a bigger boon to you than any reddit thread can be. It's a lifelong education for anxiety sufferers, to learn that planning around or preventing problems or stressful situations is only one aspect of being successful in life. I'd argue a more important aspect is the ability to land on your feet when you fail, and to learn from failure. **And most importantly, not to perpetually avoid all problems but to *trust yourself to handle problems when they occur.***

I recommend ""feel the fear and do it anyway"" and ""taming your gremlin"" to start - the latter is a bit silly and yet I find myself mentally referring to it time and again."

First, are you happy with your grades? Whatever they may be, do you feel they could or should be improved?

* If not, probably the first thing you should do is probably work more study/homework time into your schedule to bring your grades up to wherever you feel they should be.

* If you're happy with them, see question two. 

Second, do you have a lot of free time? That is, do you spend a lot of time watching TV, on reddit, or doing anything else you wouldn't put on a resume? 

* If not, you probably have struck a good balance and don't really have room in your schedule to add more things. 

* If you do, maybe consider getting more involved. That could be working in a lab, joining another student organization, or even getting a job / internship. 


This obviously isn't a set formula; it's all about using your judgement (what you want grade-wise, what ""a lot"" of free time is, etc.) to evaluate how you're using your time, but hopefully it helps get you in the right mindset. No one can unilaterally say that you or anyone else is under- or over-involved, because it will vary person to person. "

Lets one doctor have more patients on the go than they could manage alone but also means you see a student who will do everything by the book and take a bit longer, they don't have the experience or intuition yet.  Overall I'm a fan of the practice, but I digress.

Anyway, in this particular case after going through my entire medical history with the student and what I had tried to manage the nausea so far and all the minute details of how it was impacting my day to day life, the doctor came in herself and just smiled and said ""you want the pills, don't you.""

Doesn't matter.  Boehner doesn't get to speak for all the other members of the House.  If he did, we wouldn't need all the others.

The Senate has to deal with the revenue bills sent it by the House - or as the case may be, not, and shut down the government."

MidnightSlinks,nutrition,1388718164.0,"It seems like looking for a lower-sodium meat for your lunches would be your easiest solution. I believe there are low-sodium options for certain packaged meats, but cheap/pre-packaged deli meat is typically not the highest quality meat so along with preserving food, the sodium is also there to mask the sub-par flavor of the meat.

It's a bit more expensive, but you could check out your store's deli and ask them for a cut of meat that doesn't have a high-sodium marinade on it. Fun fact: most large grocery chains keep a binder with their deli/bakery's nutrition information behind the counter and will present it upon request."

&gt; being treated like a guy just fill me with too much disgust and sadness to do much of anything. 

This counts as dysphoria in my book. 

&gt;I just don't hate everything about me all the time.

That's good! I'd be worried for you if you hated you all the time. It's perfectly okay to like yourself.

&gt;Sometimes I find myself doing something and just having fun without any internal turmoil or worse I just feel fine with my body and I feel like that just invalidates everything. 

It's perfectly okay to not hate your body all the time. After all, it's you and you don't hate yourself, right? Even after you transition, if you do, it'll still be your body. It's a part of you, it's just that some parts of it haven't developed correctly. Besides, it's not like most people think about their body all the time. Usually it's just there, and unless something brings attention to it, they don't think about it. 

&gt;Am I being a bit too hard on myself?

Yes. You really are.

cr42,college,1388718320.0,"The short answer is it depends. For undergraduate work? Not too much; the better campuses attract overall more competitive and talented cohorts, but the education received is comparable across most disciplines. For graduate work? A lot separates the different campuses, because even within the different campuses programs can vary greatly in their prestige relative to the rest of the country. 

Campuses like Berkeley (4.18 GPA / 31 ACT), LA (4.15 / 30) and San Diego (4.11 / 29) attract classes that are -- compared to their peers at other campuses -- more academically gifted as a whole. The numbers for the 2013 admit cohort to campuses like Santa Barbara (4.01 GPA / 28 ACT) Riverside (3.72 / 25), and Santa Cruz (3.84 / 26) are -- as you can see -- not as high as these other ""flagship"" campuses, though still pretty impressive depending upon who you ask. 

Looking at the courses across the different campuses (and especially now that they've added online courses open to *all* UC students, regardless of home campus), at least in the sciences, there is a lot of similarity between the programs. The quality of instruction and material taught across the different campuses is comparable, at least across the sciences -- there is more of a disparity across the humanities and social sciences, since most campuses don't put an emphasis on these disciplines. Again, this is all at the undergraduate level; it's hard to argue that the programs are similar in rigor and material taught across all campuses at the graduate level."

b00tler,actuallesbians,1388718578.0,"We tried using sperm from an anonymous donor, then discovered my partner (who was the one trying to get pregnant) had severe endometriosis. She went through surgery and a drug-induced menopause to get the endometriosis under control--and at that point we stopped because her doc had found during the surgery that she only had one patent Fallopian tube and wanted to do more surgery (to minimize chance of an ectopic pregnancy) and more advanced (expensive) fertility treatment. At that point, we decided to table the baby project possibly indefinitely.  My partner was in the middle of a grad school program, and it was just too stressful and we could have managed the expense but it just didn't feel right.

A few years later, my partner finished her grad school program and was approaching the age where our opportunity to have a child was shrinking (I am 5 years older) so we decided to try again with a known donor.  We asked the guy we thought would be ideal, he turned us down for good reasons of his own, and we figured, well, that's that. Our other options weren't even close to him in terms of someone we could trust and feel comfortable with. We had already decided to forego more freezer canisters and awkward doctors office insemination visits.

A year later, our prospective donor called us up and said he had not stopped thinking about our request, and that a few things had changed for him and were we still interested?  We calculated possible ovulation dates on the back of a napkin, immediately booked plane flights for what seemed like the right time, and to our amazement my partner got pregnant on that very first attempt.  We now have a happy, healthy &amp; adorable 9 month old daughter.

My general piece of advice, covering both the process of becoming a parent and the parenting of a newborn, is to not cling too rigidly to Plan A. Sure, you can aim to have the baby at a certain time, have  your child biologically rather than by adoption, have the gender baby you prefer, have a healthy and ideal pregnancy, deliver naturally, breastfeed blissfully, etc. But life gets in the way sometimes and you have to be able to be flexible and embrace Plan B or Plan C, D, or E sometimes."

Another way to look at it... have you ever gone under anaesthesia for surgery? The time you are not conscious could be akin to death. To me, the time between was instantaneous. I had a similar experience when I slipped on ice and lost consciousness. I was out for ten minutes or so. When my co-workers helped me up, it was like I missed nothing. 

Now, my perspective is non-religious in nature. Truth is, I find that less scary. Even if I'm wrong, surely a just god would accept me as I am. Or if reincarnation is a thing, you would either have no memory of your past life, or the transition would be instantaneous to you. 

The only reason to be afraid of death is the concept of hell, but i find that unlikely. A just god would either accept you as you are or send you back and basically give you a do-over. 

Now, if there is a god and he is not just, then there is little reason to fear the inevitable. Might as well enjoy the time you have.

But they do not call it goodness. They do not call it anything. They are not thinking of it.**

They are too busy looking at the source from which it comes. But this is near the stage where the road passes over the rim of our world. No one's eyes can see very far beyond that: lots of people's eyes can see further than mine."" 

Good for your dad! My parents had three of us and didn't adopt at all; even one is a huge difference in the life of that one, and I'm sure your family is better off for it. :D 

&gt; When there are 150million+ abandoned children who are up for adoption out there, and then you get Freddy McFrederick birthing 7 children, I don't understand. Why couldn't you adopt seven of those poor children?

My sentiments exactly, and I've struggled for a long time to understand it. Unfortunately, the more I think about it, the less it makes sense. Particularly in cases where a couple couldn't conceive without scientific intervention. IVF costs many times over what adoption from a county foster/adoption program would, even for just one treatment. Go to two or three treatments and it's just as or far more expensive than adopting a newborn from a non-profit or through an attorney. Non-religious people's decisions on the matter don't bother me as much (only so far as that there are still children needing help from someone and why not them?) because they don't ascribe to a holy book that specifically instructs them to care for orphans. Yet the few times I've politely asked Christian couples I've known were trying to conceive if they'd consider adoption based on the sheer need in a wounded world, I've been met with dropped eyes, shuffled papers, mumbles and eventual, insincere, ""Maybe""s. There's got to be a valid reason I just don't understand, right? I wish someone would freaking explain it to me without contradicting their beliefs, already. 

Perhaps a good question for CMV or the Christian subreddit or something. If I feel like getting good and flamed, heh. 

Three is a great age to adopt! Plenty of time to still actively shape and guide their psychological development in a way that can help them avoid lots of pain and unnecessarily harsh lessons while forming trust, instilling a sense of safety, and laying the foundation for a lifelong bond. I wish you all the luck and wisdom in the world for your endeavors, and have no doubt they'll be more rewarding than either of us could imagine. \^_^"
shoryukenist,cats,1388718825.0,"Exactly right, everything good for a human urinary tract is horrible for cats.  It pisses (heh) me of when I see these commercial for fancy brands like Blue Buffalo bragging that they have cranberries for urinary health, when in fact it causes sugar crystals and blockages.

I've actually read a TON on this issue, and you are correct it is partially from lack of water.  But it is also from grains, veggies and fruits.  Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they can ONLY eat meat (besides a little cat grass), and the rest of that stuff really screws up their system, esp. urinary tract.  And think about it, if you let your cat go outside, is it going to go in the garden and eat a pumpkin, or some apples or something?  No way.

So basically ALL dry food is terrible.  The cheapest store brand wet cat food (without veg/fruit/grain) is better than the fanciest dry food in the world.    This is sort of a ""new"" thing, and pet food companies are suppressing it, and even most vets aren't aware of it.  One of the sources I learned this from was a book by a former pet food company vet.

Personally I give my 7lb cat 2 cans of Sheeba Turkey Pate a day (she doesn't even finish it, she is so small), it is 60 cents a can.  If you have multiple cats, or large cats, or/and Sheeba is too expensive, I think 9 Lives and Friskies have all meat (and meat by product) wet food that is very, very cheap. 

The water thing is correct, but cats gets almost all their water from eating meat/wet food.  So even if you put water out, a little wet food and dry food, the cat will not get enough water.  The reason for this is that the original habitat for cats is the desert, and there was rarely water to be found.

Anyway, I'f be happy to PM you some links if you would like any more info.

Hope you kitty is doing great now."

only_a_name,AskReddit,1388718829.0,"In general, you'll probably find that you still have opportunities to do and achieve a lot more as an older person than you expected to. However, it's a good idea to do everything that requires serious physical energy/strength/endurance sooner rather than later. Say, trek the Himalayas, run a marathon, take up Krav Maga, etc. 

Those are from my personal list; I'm 43 and am thin and fit and pretty healthy overall, but I developed some joint problems early on, just enough that items 2 and 3 are off the list for me at this point, and I wish I'd gotten around to them when I was younger. Things like that can happen sooner than you think.

Oh, and fuck like a beast, as someone else has already commented. Good to do at any age, but often easier when younger, for various reasons. Also, if you're female, appreciate the sexual power you have over others! If I'd had the confidence I have now when I was younger and hotter I could have had an amazing time. Not that I'm doing badly now, but it's hard not to imagine what might have been.  : )"

bigtcm,AskCulinary,1388719069.0,"All beer is ""carbonated"".

Some are carbonated naturally in the bottle by yeast ""known as bottle conditioning"". As the yeast ferment the sugar, it produces carbon dioxide. If the carbon dioxide has nowhere to go (like in a sealed bottle), it ends up carbonating the beverage, leading to bubbly beer.

Kegs are usually forced carbonated, which means hitting it with pressurized CO2 for some amount of time until the desired carbonation is reached. Some of the high pressure gas works its way into the liquid, leading again, to bubbly beer. You can use the above bottle condition method with kegs as well, but the standard is to force carb it.

Most commercial breweries use this force carb method to make their beers.

Lastly, some beers aren't carbonated at all; instead nitrogen gas is added in rather than carbon dioxide (Guiness for example). The nitrogen bubbles are much smaller, leading to a creamier mouthfeel.

&gt;  One body does not get to control legislation. Why even have a Senate if they're simply expected to do whatever the House tells them to do?

Other types of laws can originate in either house of Congress.  Constitutionally, revenue bills must originate in the House.

That is actually one of the problems with Obamacare, that may yet invalidate the whole law.  It just hasn't made it to the Supreme Court yet.  In order to get around that restriction for Obamacare, the Senate took an unrelated appropriations bill stripped out the entirety of the language, and inserted the ACA as an amendment.  Were that to be argued in a court, it is likely the court would strike down the law due to the obvious attempt to circumvent the Constitution."

I agree in theory with the whole ""it takes a village"" philosophy.  but in reality, finding that right situation with multiple other people - who are stable, and emotionally healthy, and all that - is difficult.  

Also, I hate to be that person, but 38 is not mid-thirties.  If you want to carry a naturally conceived child to term,  you don't really have the luxury of waiting around for the perfect poly situation.  If you don't care about that and you're open to adoption or surrogacy, that's cool, but the gatekeepers of that route may not be cool with your poly family. My point is, if you want to have a bio kid, you don't have time to waste, and having a kid outside of the bio route may be far more expensive and difficult than you realize.

It's common to meet someone online by chance, for example on a forum or on a random facebook comments, get to know him/her and then meet up, but you just don't have the dating intention upfront.

At puberty, hormones drive them down one path or another in a more concrete way (sexual maturity and secondary sex characteristics). 

But at 8-10 years old a kid can also tell you what gender they identify with. And by that age it's possible to inform a kid about their health in an age-appropriate way and involve them in medical decisions. So there isn't a medical reason to hormonally determine an intersex person's gender/sex without involving them in the decisions."

The other possibility I can think of (keep in mind I don't have any particular experience with Shiro's Evolve) is that you might be over blending.

Saefroch,summonerschool,1388720929.0,"We're really delving into theorycrafting here, but that's okay with me.

I don't think many people would pick Orianna over other popular mids right now (Gragas, Riven, Ziggs, Kassadin, Ahri) if she didn't have an ult that could remove about a third of a team's health in one shot. An Orianna without the damage from that ult would die to any of the other FOTM mids level 6 all-in every single time.

I don't know enough about Annie mid, Morgana, or Galio to comment on their ultimates but I do know Galio's is easily countered by on-hit stuns.

Janna's heal has enormous potential, but I don't think I've ever seen somebody use the full duration on more than two targets, it's just too risky unless you're all the way in the back of your team.

Ziggs and Orianna can clear just as fast as Janna, allowing them to either follow Janna on the roam and have a bigger impact in the ensuing fight, or just warn their side lanes then use their passives to take down a mid turret (more likely, that mid turret is very important).

Of course, almost any support would become viable with very good scaling. Lulu has been played mid in Korean competitive. Karma is mostly played as a support because of her utility, but with better ratios could again be a viable mid. Nami's pretty much in the same place as Janna as well. Mostly the utility on her kit is what's used right now, but if she had huge AP ratios, her damage output would be quite respectable, along with having a full-team knockup and haste. While we're making supports mids, why not Soraka? She used to be a viable mid. Silence, walk up, spam Q."

PlushieChomby,childfree,1388721071.0,"I wish I did, but unfortunately I haven't. The number I've met who are on or around the same page, I can count on two hands with fingers remaining. But in all fairness, it's been many years, almost a full decade, since I regularly attended any churches. Before that, the topic didn't really come up as I was so young and concerned about multiple other things, so for all I know I missed out on collecting other friends and possibly mentors who felt the same way. 

The few times a year I visit churches, I almost always walk away feeling sad, upset, annoyed, put off... But about a year ago, the church my sister was attending at the time (one that's grown to be quite massive and was co-founded by Chris Tomlin before he left to start another church in Atlanta years back) did a 3 (maybe 4? I might have missed a week) part sermon specifically on the topic of adoption and how it's the church's duty to step up and diminish the number of children waiting to be adopted by bringing them into their families. I was elated at the prospect someone was actually not only bringing it up in a big way, but seemed to be trying to do something about it, so I came back week after week to hear the very good points being made until the series ended. 

Eight months later, I visited again and asked one of the church leaders how progress was going on getting members capable of adopting to adopt. He looked confused for a minute, but with a bit of prompting recalled the sermons to which I was referring and went, ""Oh yes... Well I'm sure it's going very well..."" Kinda made me wonder if any of the thousands of members of this mega church had bothered going the distance - meanwhile, small children and moms holding babies, small children and moms holding babies *everywhere*. Once again, I left sad and disappointed. 

It seems a lot of them think it's a great idea... you know, for *other* Christians. Hey, somebody else will do it, right? And then we'll cheer them on. Pardon me, it's our doctor's office calling back to schedule my wife's consultation for in-vitro, be right back. 

The ones I *have* met, I've actually met through volunteer work. You get to chatting, someone says something, a door is opened, then another, and you find you're not alone after all. Wish there were some type of group or gathering place for our kind, but the others I've met have been sort of like me - devoted to doing good and otherwise kinda loners. :\"

Appropriations bills must originate in the House.  The Senate doesn't have to passively accept them.  It can pass, vote down, or amend them.

marcm6246,gainit,1388721568.0,"Hi there! I know, it's *very* overwhelming isn't it? Don't worry though! It will make sense in no time. In terms of what to eat, like the others have said, find your TDEE, there's a few calculators out there. Once you do, add 300-500 onto it and eat that much calories in the day. Overtime you will gain weight with this, and if you do that in conjunction with working out, you'll be building muscle. Heads up though! You *need* to eat plenty of protein to repair muscle after a workout as well. Most people recommend 1g of protein per 1 pound of bodyweight (it took me the longest time to understand what this meant... If you weigh 145 pounds, eat 145 grams of protein). This can be difficult at times. Calories are fairly easy to attain, but protein is a slow one to achieve throughout the day. This is why many people drink protein shakes or eat protein bars, it's an easy way to boost your protein intake. 1 protein bar usually has roughly 15 grams of protein and are the size of a chocolate bar, shakes can have up to 50 grams! Just to give you an idea.

As for the exercise, if or when you join a gym, they usually give you the option to meet with a fitness advisor or a personal trainer to show you the ropes on how to use the machines and free weights if you request it. This was a *major* lifesaver when I joined the gym as I had 0 knowledge on how to squat, deadlift, etc... It was really helpful to have someone there to show me how its done.

I hope I explained this thoroughly enough!

And just a tip, try to get into the gym ASAP and not spend too much time analyzing. I bought my membership 3 months ago and i've barely used it because i've been too caught up in analysis paralysis. Fact is, if you're lifting heavy and eating, you *will* see results. Don't get too caught up on the math and science behind it. Go in for a few test runs if you can to establish what weights you can lift and to **get your form right**. Form is everything! Don't let those knees go past your toes on squatting!!

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388721953.0,"&gt;That may be, but it doesn't take away from the main point which is that users don't want to browse on a slow and cluttered mobile site. They want apps.

For the same reason old people store all their bookmarks on their desktop and have dozens of icons.  They're using  'apps' as bookmarks for a web  browser.  Writing your own browser as an app is actually a fairly terrible idea for performance and security, but making direct shortcuts to a webpage on mobile is not presented to you in a front and centre simple  fashion. 

&gt;Not only are they cleaner and easier,

Only if you suck at writing web apps.

&gt; but you can send push notifications, easily customize the layout and save your settings,

You can't do push notifications easily on the  web certainly - but then that's the kind of thing they could be waiting for.  There's no point in investing a bunch of money in an app if the web will do that later. Everything else you can do in the web though, particularly on a site like reddit where you have an  account. 

I've done enough web apps at this  point, some with fairly big dev teams that I'm convinced the only  reason  people use about 90% of their apps is because making a bookmark into an icon was not front and centre on the original iphone, so now everyone just uses apps.  Most apps are basically pointless.  This is part of why the windows store on Windows 8 sucks so much... because if you need native app performance (coming to mobile with native code  in a browser) you already have it, and otherwise... you have the web.

23skiddsy,movies,1388722717.0,"Unfortunately, those same large animals are the ones that don't have any room to survive out in the wild. Many animals are not nearly as territorial as we understand them to be, they just require lots of room to keep themselves fed. If you feed them (preferably through enrichment so they get the mental stimulation they need), they have less of a need to roam. Or at least many species do. 

Pacing and other such stereotypies have drastically dropped as enrichment gets better and better, and this is not just at San Diego, but at most accredited zoos and aquariums. 

By the way, are you referring to [melanistic leopards](http://www.wildlifetoybox.com/images/products/tires/Leopard2_Tire19HeavyDuty.jpg)? Or as a word for all members of panthera? There's no such individual animal as a ""panther"", so I'm a bit confused.

But when it comes down to be in captivity or die due to lack of space in the wild, I think the more humane answer is captivity with good enrichment and the best that we can provide. And while in captivity, those animals can help educate about why we need to preserve wild places for them. "

Oh gosh, it's hard to say without context. I guess if you're shaking hands when you meet someone that's a lead in since their bound to notice right off the bat. Otherwise, maybe in conversations about growing up, like if people are sharing stories out of childhood you must have one or two (hopefully some fun ones)."
redyellowand,feminisms,1388723275.0,"I agree with this to a point (probably because  I tend to go with the less-objectifying questions when I talk to children). I feel like a compliment on a dress, hairstyle, or outfit is okay because there's potential agency in those things. 

On the other hand, people constantly saying I was skinny fucked me up well into my high school years (do you want me to stay skinny? Is that all I am? Am I going to disappoint you if I'm ever not skinny? What about the rest of me?).

I think it would be great if we could veer away from appearance-related comments in general (again, unless they're agency related like makeup, hair, shoes, clothes, whatever), unless the other person asks. They might seem insignificant, but when I was in treatment for anorexia nervosa, SO many of my fellow...patients I guess would bring up specific instances of people saying things that might seem completely benign--""you've put on weight!"", ""you look healthy!""--that stuck with them for years later. 

""Observational"" compliments like that are weird anyway--how do you respond to them? ""Thanks, I'm skinny because my entire family has a weird relationship with food!"" Or things like ""your hair is so long!""? ""Thanks, that's what hair does!"" A lot of them are just like...to fill the air. 

Improved small talk would be a benefit for *everyone*, not just parents and children.

(Also, I don't like the use of ""objectifying"" here...)

(Also, sorry for the abundance of personal examples; I didn't want to speak for everyone, so I went with what I know, which is white, middle class, cisgendered, able-bodied and heterosexual. The thought that my privilege means I'm probably getting off easy is a truly horrifying one.)"

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388723818.0,"&gt;. With apps, you generally have a different one for each device. 

Yes.  Testing for android is a nightmare.  I picked up about a dozen androids last week, and people are still selling new droids with android 2.3 and everything up to 4.4.  Building apps, particularly for android is a nightmare when it comes to testing, a giant mess of OS's and screen sizes.  If you have a popular device on one of the major devices it's usually not so bad, for  everyone else the experience can be terrible.  

&gt;. Thus, the app can be perfected for each device individually, with the bugs fixed separately and the different features of the device used to their full potential.

Which wouldn't be necessary if Android and Windows phone took the behaviour of apple and pushed out updates.  

But they don't of course.  

You definitely do not optimize for every device, depends  how much money you spend, but say, games I've worked on where you're looking to move a few millions of units you might test on the top 40 devices or so and that's about it.  And even then keeping on top of all the operating systems they can have on all of the different carriers is quite challenging.  

&gt;A web application is slower and clunkier and because it has to work on all platforms

Er... no, not really.  A web app you need only format for the screen and you let the browser handle rendering performance and security. 

&gt; And that, coupled with limits in technology, is why notifications are not possible (and they're huge).

er...

There's no conceptual reason why you couldn't have notifications from a web browser.   Opera for desktop actually does that on its homepage if you have facebook or a few major mail applications and a couple of other  things.  That Google and Apple and MS don't let you is a permissions design issue, not a fundamental technical limit.  


&gt;For the record, I disagree with most of what you're saying, but instead of countering it 

Well obviously.  But we're trying to get into the head of why they're  making the choices they are, not whether or not they should be making those choices.   Reddit is  big on outsourcing  everything (image hosting, meme generation,  data storage and hosting through amazon etc.).  That necessarily limits them as a company.  As much as web apps are mostly pointless, if you're a multi billion dollar company with thousands of employees blowing a few  million dollars making an app is not really a big deal.  When you live on the edge by outsourcing absolutely everything  but the kitchen sink (and hell, maybe that) and are essentially a 3-5 million dollar a year actual studio spending a couple of million dollars on an app is tricky.  

I ran a (student project) in one semester with 30 undergrads who did a project far more sophisticated than any of the reddit scrapers, but that would have cost about 1.5 million dollars to actual do as commercial development, that's a lot for a small outfit.

cyranothe2nd,needadvice,1388723951.0,"I'm a college English teacher.

1. There isn't a lot of money in teaching. Tenure jobs are hard to come by and you really have to be willing to move wherever the job is, especially at college level. That said, you should only teach if you genuinely love it. A lot of people burn out in the first few years because they're paying student loans and making very little. Plus there's the bureaucracy to deal with, especially when teaching minors. A lot of people come to hate it. So, you really need to be passionate about this career choice. 

2. Science is in more demand that English right now, and is consequently paid more. 

3. For teaching middle or high school you will need a Bachelors in Education and a teacher's certification course (usually another year or two after your BA/BS). Many colleges offer the certification as part of the degree and will get you a teaching internship. 

4. If you're interested in going to college, go to community college. It's way cheaper and you can usually transfer with junior standing. 

5. Finally--I didn't go to college until I was 26. I couldn't afford it right out of high school and had no family support. Going to college was the best decision I ever made. It is a great experience and opened a lot of doors for me, both professionally and personally.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388724547.0,"&gt;. I'm no expert, but if the web app isn't connected to the phone (installed and periodically or always checking for notifications), it can't happen. Even if it could, it would still be from the browser and not as easy to tell from a bookmark or whatever.

Not really a complicated problem to solve, actually that would be a trivial first year first semester sort of problem for a student.  

But yes, you'd need to keep the web app open in a browser window, which is essentially what the phone is doing now to keep it running as it's own process.  You'd just shift the home screen to really being a browser window rather than a native desktop.

Ironically, this is essentially what microsoft tried to do with Internet explorer for years and never  managed to get it all to behave.  


&gt;There are downsides (namely publicity ones) to selectively optimizing for certain devices, especially if you pull the API to eliminate competition (and thus disenfranchise some smaller markets).

Uh...

No.  Nothing to do with the API and competition.  If you're trying to optimize an app for android 2.1 on a 4 inch screen it's a separate problem from a  5.3 inch screen on android 4.3.  The Google API's are different and you may need to actually write multiple apps, the security situation is a nightmare (especially on older devices).  On top of that, because every single type of phone is different (and sometimes the same branded phone has different internals in different markets) it's not possible for a small outfit to test enough hardware.  Our lab has about 60 or 70 devices in it for testing, and we could probably quadrupole that and still miss millions of devices and potential customers who we just kinda hope it works for.   "

OriginalStomper,pics,1388725077.0,"Let me reply again, but with a little more clarity:  in contrast to your [unsupported] claims of minimal retouching, I have seen numerous examples and reports of substantial retouching, as well as Cindy Crawford's quote indicating she does not even recognize herself.

So even if you are who you say you are, I do not trust your judgment about what qualifies as ""minimal.""  But look at it this way -- you start with photos of the most ""beautiful"" and photogenic people on the planet.  ANY touching up, no matter how minimal it may seem to your jaded view, is making those rare looks even more unattainable.

Yes, people can work at being fit.  I'm not denying or discouraging that.  People can minimize body fat by eating less, or eating a healthier diet.  Fine, if that's important to them.  But they still won't look like the idealized images they are bombarded with every single day.

Kids need to learn that these images are fantasies designed to sell stuff, and not the way real people actually look without a whole lot of effort AND some helpful PS.

That's all I'm saying.  I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to make a living using fantasy images to sell stuff.  Far from it.  I'm only saying kids need to learn the truth early, before their own body-image is damaged, and that requires constant education to counter the constant stream of images."

Renner1,AskReddit,1388725422.0,"&gt; The abortion question is one I struggle with. I'm a man so a very large part of me, tells me it's not my choice. I don't carry the child. My body isn't fucked up for months....etc.

As far as I'm concerned, abortion is perfectly acceptable in instances where the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother, or in the rare case of a pregnancy through rape or incest.

After that point, it gets a lot murkier-- and I have to say it really puts me off when there are certain elements that insist that a woman's entitled to a free abortion whenever she should ask, no questions or procedures attached. More disconcerting are those who would act in a completely irresponsible or outright dangerous manner sexually, and then feel as though they're entitled to an abortion for free and essentially as a form of birth control.

While I suppose you could say that a large percentage accepted slavery, though less than 50%.  Quite a bit of the rest of the country did not accept it, and we had quite a large war about it.

Mixed race heritage has also gotten a lot more common in my generation (owing in part to the 1967 [Loving vs Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_vs_virginia) landmark SCOTUS decision). I bet if I were a half generation+ older I'd have experienced more problems purely due to the novelty of it.

Now that I think of it, my sister and I went to a (primarily Irish) Catholic school in Medford and I definitely felt a little bigotry there, even as a kindergartener. Even my damn teachers joined in, although I didn't realize what was happening until years later, when I got a bit of perspective. My sister had it a lot worse though, being two years older. She got a lot of shit for bringing ""weird"" lunches (onigiri, etc.) and basically had a miserable three years. We moved to a far more accepting suburban public school after my first year, so I lucked out, but I can only imagine how shitty it would've been to be surrounded by that through my formative years.

The_White_Baron,learnmath,1388725896.0,"This is a really subtle distinction. The correct answer means that if you conducted your study 100 times, you'd expect 95 of those studies to say between 9% and 15% blah blah blah. Notice how this is a direct reference to *your method of investigation*. In a way, it's kind of a measure of how *consistent* your study is. 

The answer you selected implies that your study asserts a 95% chance of that happening. But that's hogwash. Your study isn't going to somehow alter reality. You're describing how confident you think your method of investigation is. 

If this sounds like splitting hairs, it kind of is. I'd caution you to think about confidence intervals as how consistent your study is. How is it different than saying event x will happen with 95% probability? You're no longer talking about the consistency of *your study* anymore. 

.... in a sense, all I'm saying is that correlation is not causation. If i tell you that I measured the relationship between red cars and car accidents, and give a 95% confidence interval that red cars are involved in 50% more accidents than yellow cars, it'd be ludicrous for me to assert that *if you get a red car, I'm 95% sure you're 50% more likely to be involved in a car accident than if you bought a yellow car.* Because red cars don't cause car accidents, and a yellow car certainly won't save you from a car accident."

PlushieChomby,neopets,1388726376.0,"I've had a few over the last decade, usually when I'm playing for hours a day on the site and find myself in a real life emotional state of some sort, so here are the two most interesting that I can recall: 

One of my worst nightmares found me doing dishes in the sink on what felt like a realistic sunny day. After a few, I flipped on the disposal because the drain seemed clogged, and this horrendous shriek-wail filled the air. Freaked out, I quickly hit the switch and stuck my hand down to see what the hell had happened, only to pull up bits of bloody Meepit, eyes still intact and staring at me. I look up and there's a Meepit looking angry on the other side of the window above the sink. *Oh God*... I took a few steps back, knocking into a kitchen chair while the meepit outside made angry ""MEEP"" noises at me. Something grabs my ankle from under the chair - another meepit. I scream and run upstairs as the ""MEEP"" sounds increase in number, seemingly coming from just around every corner. Yanking down the attic cord, I accidentally squish what's left of the baby-sized meepit in my hand on the stairs while grabbing a rung to climb. It wails again and now the ""MEEP MEEP MEEP"" sounds are chanting as one. Clambering into the dark attic, I realize it's not sunny out, it's pouring buckets of rain and the little window doesn't allow light in. My foot bumps something. 

It MEEPs. 

The MEEP chanting starts again, this time from inside the attic with me. I start scuttling back to the wall where the small window is, kicking rats aside left and right. Lightning flashes and in horror, I realize, *there are no rats, just meepits everywhere*. Hundreds of tiny pinpoints of light are reflections in meepit eyes, all staring me down, slowly advancing as they chant, ""MEEP MEEP MEEP"" in unison. They're melding together to form larger meepits until the room is full of knee-height meepits, still chanting and coming at me. Lightning flashes and I see them leaping to dogpile me, fangs bared, which is the exact moment I wake up screaming, ""I'M SORRY MEEPITS I DIDN'T KNOW!!!"" 

That was five years ago, but my ex boyfriend, who my scream woke up, still calls me from time to time, yells, ""I'M SORRY MEEPITS, I DIDN'T KNOW!"" into the phone, and hangs up while I hear him and his friends laughing in the background. He didn't even play neopets so that was fun to explain. It sounds silly now, but I was so terrified that I sat upright, covered in a cold sweat while screaming waking up. 

The best dream I can recall is a lot shorter. I was riding my plushie chomby, who totally felt like a real dinosaur in the dream but super soft and quilty, down to the rainbow pool because he told me his birthday wish was to be darigan. The rude faerie pointed to a ""No Chombies Allowed"" sign on the fence next to the entrance, and we were so disappointed we kept coming back to various points of entry wearing disguises trying to get in. His best was a mustache, tan overcoat, giant sunglasses and a massive puppet to disguise his tail, which he claimed to the faerie was a fifth foot. ""My amusement foot."" Bitch still wouldn't let us in, but coming up with disguises was a lot of fun and I woke up super happy and rolled over to hug what I only then realized was my totally imaginary dream best friend. Good times. "

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388726604.0,"&gt;Unless I am a complete idiot and you can explain very easily and very quickly with sources to back you up what goes in to this and how exactly it could be changed easily, I'm done here.

Perhaps we're not communicating what we're talking about here.

Passing a notification back from an open tab in a web browser would be very simple.  Literally you just leave a socket open, and if it receives the right signal you could pass a simply formatted notification out to the OS  notification system (I would built it to simply accept an icon and a number so you know which tab sent the notice from the icon, and how 0many notices you have).

&gt;network interactions on the scale of an entire OS (and potentially even the http protocol (and yes I know that's redundant

HTTP is only one protocol on the network, and you can send pretty much whatever you want down the pipe.  

Think of networking in layers (the proper  networking description of this is the OSI model with 7 layers though TCP/IP is only really a 5 layer model, either way HTTP rests at the top as an application layer level problem).  Notifications are all right at that top level - and actually building notification infrastructure into a browser would be preferable to the current method which is platform dependent.  You'd just need to *either* come up with a new protocol and open another socket to send a notification on that protocol, which is the hardway, or use existing AJAX/HTML5/similar connections with a custom formatted data packet that the browser knows how to interpret.  It's a really simple problem to solve, if you could get the browser vendors to agree on a standard for it - implementing it would be easy.  Getting browser companies to agree on a standard  for it, god knows, it could be a simple tag (which would be the easiest and safest way to do it).  


Actually bundling notification into a browser would probably be a good thing in the long run, because it would allow notifications  from the browser on the desktop.  


http://athousandnodes.com/article/html5-desktop-notification

Actually has a simple jquery to do desktop notifications outside the browser - requires HTML 5 and Javascript.  Requires a webkit browser and that you grant it permissions - it works in chrome for me.    That's roughly on part with the second assignment from a first year first semester CS student.   If you could get the webkit windownotifications as multi platform standard it could be  everywhere.  


&gt;And one other thing: if you'd need to keep the web app running in a browsing window to get the benefit, doesn't that just make it like a less convenient version of an app

More convenient not less.   But yes, exactly why apps are redundant.  The vast majority of them don't actually do anything you can't already do in a browser, and WebGL and HTML 5 significantly cut down on the stuff that requires native code for.   Unfortunately a huge chunk of the installed device  base supports neither webGl nor HTML 5.  



This is by the way, essentially rehashing the debate Apple had versus the world about flash.  It's redundant technology, if only we can get everyone to agree to a new scheme.  But Flash is actually fairly complicated, both in its ability to play videos and play games.  To just build in notification tools to a browser would be trivial.  "

OP:

It's a little weird just because you *were* asleep, and that type of thing would never be okay if it was just some random dude suddenly jerking off over you. 

But you guys are in a relationship. Things happen, you talk it out, and hopefully whatever made you uncomfortable doesn't happen again. Frankly, I love being woken up to sexy snuggles, so it wouldn't surprise me if someone in his past maybe enjoyed that as well. Or maybe just the thought of ""there's someone in my bed that means I'm supposed to act this particular way"" was going through his head, due to inexperience. 

If it happens again, then there might be some cause for concern, because he's now aware that it bothered you. If it *does* happen again, maybe then it's time to rethink your relationship. It sounds though that you like the guy, he just fucked up and did something you weren't fond of. He's probably learned his lesson, really not that big of a deal. Honestly, you guys had sex.

CrazyPlato,changemyview,1388727265.0,"When I was in high school, I had a similar view about going to college. IT's weird, but think about it: it's a giant change in your life, you know that it's going to happen (at least, it was for me, in my home), you aren't going to go back to the way things were, and (despite many stories from people who had been there) you don't *really* know what's going to happen to you there until you see it for yourself.

What got me through that, and through the concept of death as well, is the harsh truth of it: it's going to happen. We don't get a real say in whether or not we die, it has to happen eventually. That being said, what is the point of being worried about it? We worry about things because it helps motivate us to change things, but worrying about death won't help us avoid dying in time. The same with college: I decided to stop worrying about how I'd live in college, beyond doing the basic things I could do to prepare for it. At most, with death, you can put affairs in order for the day it happens, and wait.

But then, why simplify life as just waiting to die. If you think about it, death is supposed to be the end of the story. As far as we really know, there aren't any chapters beyond that (maybe there are, but that's just speculation on this side of the mortal coil). Isn't jumping to the end of a story boring? Who watches a film, skips to the ending, and calls it a night? We want the middle parts, the action, the excitement, the tragedy. They're what make the story worth anything. Why focus on dying, when you can be focusing on living your life? Go find a hobby. Meet friends. Go on an adventure. Get injured. Get laid. Whatever, but the point is to do *something* with the time you have, instead of using it to worry about what you'll do when you run out of time."

People said that about 10 years ago about blackberry as the greatest  thing ever for business.  If you wanted to develop for mobile you used QT  for noika devices for home users, and Blackberry for business.   I remember doing a very complicated project for QT about 6 years ago... that never even got deployed.  Contracts were signed and it had to be done, but in less than 12 months the market completely fell out from under Nokia.   

If microsoft hires someone competent at the top, or Samsung/Google has a significant change in direction we're going to see a major shakeup in how the whole mobile business operates.  

This bullshit of trying to develop for devices  that have different carrier issues on every carrier in the world, and operating systems that were released &gt;3 years ago and haven't been patched let alone upgraded is not sustainable, and someone is going to go for the jugular on that market and get  this sorted out.

The general  rule is that government officials are immune from prosecution for their acts undertaken as part of their duties as government employees when those actions have been lawfully approved above them.

So if the Supreme court were to rule that the government data collection was illegal and a breach of the  constitution *and* they continued to do it there would be a problem.  But at the moment  it appears the NSA is acting as lawfully chartered to do so by congress and under FISA courts - or at least they believe their actions are legal as per the legal advice from FISA  courts and the Attorney Generals  office etc.  

Besides that, Snowden would be on the hook for numerous computer breach issues which he really has no defence for.  He used his position as a system administrator to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and passwords on numerous occasions.  That it was so easy to get people to hand over usernames and passwords kind of makes a mockery of the law, but he'd still be in  serious trouble.  "

Jess_than_three,ainbow,1388728746.0,"No, I mean, about the things he claimed in his - essay? Things like:

&gt; Mike Priefer also said on multiple occasions that I would wind up burning in hell with the gays, and that the only truth was Jesus Christ and the Bible.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; During the special-teams meeting the following day, Mike Priefer berated me in an incredibly harsh tone the likes of which I've never heard a coach use about my abilities as a punter (and I have been berated before). The room went silent after he finished speaking, in a way that normally does not happen during meetings when someone is being called out.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; As we sat down in our chairs, Mike Priefer, in one of the meanest voices I can ever recall hearing, said: ""We should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows."" 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; On Dec. 13, during his weekly media session, Mike Priefer was asked about the patch in a joking manner. He responded tersely: ""I don't even want to talk about it. Those distractions are getting old for me, to be honest with you."" When asked if he had talked to me about the distractions, he said: ""No. He won't listen."" At no time during the season had Coach Priefer ever approached me about my actions, nor had he ever made any intimation that I was a distraction to the team. He also said: ""To me, it's getting old. He's got to focus on punting and holding."" Up to that point I had not dropped a single hold on field goals, and despite a shaky game against Tampa Bay and several substandard punts against other teams, both my net- and gross-punting marks were nearly in line with my career averages, which remain the best in Vikings history.

(key points: Kluwe not dropping a single hold on field goals, and having marks just slightly below his averages - the best averages in Vikings history; despite these facts, his coach saying ""He's got to focus on punting and holding"", as though he was having a problem with those things)

&gt; I had also been repeatedly instructed by Mike Priefer to dial back the distance of my kicks to give our coverage team a better chance at getting down the field, a request I did my best to follow despite knowing it would mean sacrificing my own averages and allowing people to fashion an argument against me based on those numbers. His exact words were: ""Chris, we need you to kick it higher and shorter, because our coverage team sucks. We need to force fair catches as much as possible."" I complied, as I had always been taught to put the team before myself.

(which is to say, his averages that season would have been higher than they were, had he not done exactly what that same coach told him to do)

This next point I don't feel like grabbing bits and pieces up and down the thing to demonstrate, but the gist is:

They brought on someone to replace him if his surgery went poorly, but it didn't; then, without checking on his progress or giving him any opportunity to demonstrate whether his kicking ability remained intact, they drafted a punter and cut the guy who was supposed to potentially be replacing him

&gt;  Multiple pundits questioned the Vikings' decision to draft a punter in the fifth round, as there were still several positions of need, and several players at those positions still available to be drafted.

(which suggests that sports pundits, some of them at least, considered that there were probably higher priorities for the Vikings than replacing Kluwe)

&gt; Rick told me that this was solely about competition and had nothing to do with my views. I do not believe he was telling the truth. I had not been approached about reducing my contract for cap-space purposes, nor was my punting average poor enough to justify spending a fifth-round pick on a punter for competition. (My gross average in 2012 was almost exactly my career average, and I had a career-best net average. Statistically speaking, I am also the best punter in Vikings history, despite seven years of coaches asking me to deliberately sacrifice my own numbers to help the team, a request with which I always complied.)

This isn't something I can quote as it's an impression I've gotten and not something he said, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but:

Between the time his surgery took place and the time he was kicked off the team, he was not given the opportunity to prove himself

(He does say ""At no point from the end of the season, on Jan. 9, 2013, to my arrival at OTAs, on April 21, was I contacted by Leslie Frazier or by any of the other coaches."" What I'm not certain about is whether he did have that opportunity between April 21 and either April 27th, when the new punter was drafted (clearly intended as Kluwe's replacement) or May 6th (when he was officially canned).)

And of course, 

None of this discussion of why he was let go has any bearing on one of his primary purposes:

&gt; If there's one thing I hope to achieve from sharing this story, it's to make sure that Mike Priefer never holds a coaching position again in the NFL, and ideally never coaches at any level. (According to the Pioneer Press, he is ""the only in-house candidate with a chance"" at the head-coaching job.) It's inexcusable that someone would use his status as a teacher and a role model to proselytize on behalf of his own doctrine of intolerance, and I hope he never gets another opportunity to pass his example along to anyone else. I also hope that Leslie Frazier and Rick Spielman take a good look in the mirror and ask themselves if they are the people they truly profess themselves to be."

I especially don't like talking about it on reddit for both of those reasons, but I really don't talk about my beliefs in my offline life either unless I'm with other people I know from church.

As for women who are waiting for marriage AND are asexual and/or demisexual?

Lots of people feel they have a lower sex drive when they're outside a relationship than they do when in a relationship, and it would make sense for some a/demisexual virgins (who are choosing to remain virgins until marriage) to actually be in that category.

(I recommend Jester814 - his videos are awesome.)

It also has a wonderful mission editor and some single-player scenarios if you're looking for a quick pick-me-up.

If all you're looking is a quick evening fix, I would typically recommend CoD, but from what I've read here and in /r/games, Ghosts has lackluster graphics, a crappy four-hour campaign, and messy multiplayer maps that don't lend well to the action.

phenger,sysadmin,1388729945.0,"Various security benchmarks are always good to look at. The DoD one that was linked above is a good one. I also like to look at the CIS benchmarks (https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/benchmarks/). Also, don't forget to harden your underlying virtual environment as well! VMware has some excellent hardening guides out there for their products (http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2013/10/vsphere-5-5-hardening-guide-released.html), and I'm sure Citrix and the like have guides too.

It's always a good idea to take the guides with a grain of salt, and to fully understand the implications of the changes you are making. This is one reason why I'm partial to the CIS guides - they do a good job of explaining why a change is recommended, and they offer hardening suggestions for both more and less sensitive environments.

This probably goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway - never think that simply hardening an OS is enough. You always have to take the Security Onion approach (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Defense_in_depth), and you can't just set it and forget it. Having and following well defined procedures for change management, patching, patch testing, security audits, etc are all very important. Even if you're not required to comply with certain regulatory standards (PCI, NERC-CIP, HIPAA, etc) it may not hurt to take a look at their guidelines to help you think of other ways to help secure your environment. I'd start with PCI, because it's the most straightforward to understand (PCI DSS v3 https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?agreements=pcidss&amp;association=pcidss).

Though the Mods complain that they can't make others believe they're views, which is why they ban non-believers of global warming, yet the majority of people who do believe in it can't be swayed either. It's just a cluster fuck of people that think they know what is true and best so they do whatever advances their agenda.

i think a firearm is freedom because it is the ultimate check and balance on the government. it is the ultimate form of self defense. it is more than just a tool that can help fight oppression and crime but a symbol too. i mean look at the AK pattern rifle. it has seen the fall of more governments than i could name. look at the AR15 pattern rifle. it saved lives in the LA riots.

i mean if you look at my post history you can easily see my bias, but if you actually do the math (beyond the correlation/causation studies politicians on both sides throw around) you can conclude, bare minimum guns dont increase crime.

a gun is what takes any two people, teen girl, handicapped old man, 200 lb ex convict, military men etc. and puts them on a level playing field. it lets you say ""hey, you cannot force me to do anything with violence because are equals now.""

What happened to all the cheering?! Did I not break it? I look down, and yeah, it was snapped clean in two... everyone's still got shocked expressions on their faces... I look down again... *wait*. IS THAT BLOOD?! WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?!

Conquerz,progresspics,1388730197.0,"Let me add my ""workout rutine"" and my diet:

Diet: Non existent, i tried, but i failed, and since i don't like many foods, i just stuck to 2 pizzas a day. Double cheese at that.

Workout: I work nights, so i try to workout in the early morning before going to sleep and after waking up (basically all my free time). So i started MMA and Brazilian Jiujitsu almost 2 months ago, at first it was somewhat hard because the first 40 minutes of each class we do ""warmup"" which consist of basically jogging for 10 minutes and then 30 minutes of HIIT (with rests in between ofc), now im able to do 2 classes a day really easy i just get exhausted when they put me in the cage to fight a competent fighter because they drain every little bit of strength out of me.

This month (or next month, depends on finances) i'll be starting Boxing and muay thai/kick boxing (again) and some swimming to enhance my lung capacity.

Basically i'll do boxing every morning from 9 am to 10 am, then go to sleep for 6 hours, and as soon as i wake up, have lunch and go to kick boxing practice, then run to the gym and swim for half an hour as fast and as much as possible, and then go over to mma and jiujitsu classes.

Don't worry i'll most likely do boxing three times a week and muay thai 3 times a week also, but switch the days, because after all of that, i'll be spent and overtrained in a week.

It'll add up to 4.5hours of martial arts training a day, and half an hour of swimming, plus my 9 hours of work and 1.5hours of traveling back and forth from work, thats 16 hours, i got 6 hours for sleep, and 2 hours for eating (half an hour each meal) and traveling to the various martial arts places (kick boxing is in one place, bjj and mma in another, and boxing in another).

Wish me luck!

(and yes, i'll try to diet, because if i want to be a professional fighter i will HAVE to diet to be better)"

Conceiving, expecting, and raising a child are all shared social experiences, and I think it's wonderful to use ""we"" for those... but a lot of people see pregnancy as a physical/medical condition that you definitely are not directly experiencing at all.

Jess_than_three,news,1388730733.0,"&gt; The point I was trying to make is that the coach may have had legitimate concerns about the cooperativeness of the player.

But like I said:

&gt; I dunno, he says repeatedly that he did exactly what they told him to, sacrificing his own numbers for the good of the team. I don't know anything about sportball - do you have reason to believe that he's lying?

Again, I know little to nothing about sportball, but to me, a player who's willing to consistently tank his own averages for the sake of the team isn't one who's a concern with regard to ""cooperativeness"" - especially when that's been going on for seven years.

And that seven year thing, I guess to me that's a big question. What changed that last year to make them can him when they didn't the year before or the year before that? Surely it wasn't his performance - which as he says was the best in Vikings history in that position. It's possible that it was because his salary increased, but he claims nobody approached him about taking a pay cut. It could have been about his surgery and their concern that he wouldn't perform as well after it, but he states that they didn't bother to contact him about that, and every indication is that they had planned to replace him pretty much by the time it happened.

So if it's not his performance, or his pay, or his potential future performance, what else is it? What changed that season?

It's very possible that there were other issues at play, but if the things that Kluwe has said are indeed true, I can't believe that that wasn't by far the biggest.

(That said, ""discriminatory reasons"" kind of glosses over what likely took place. His coach was, allegedly, a bigoted shitbag - totally. Let's assume for the sake of argument that that's true. So over the course of the season, he tries to bully Kluwe to stop speaking out, treats him like shit, whatever. Kluwe doesn't back down. Now the coach hates him and thinks he's an asshole, not because of his **view**, but because of the conflict *over* his view. Add that dynamic in, and the idea of his being fired over that issue gets a whole lot more plausible.)"

hylandw,DnD,1388731232.0,"The Black Room.

To be placed in a dungeon where a time limit is found. The players have to get going... or else. This hinders them.

The adventurers, going through the dungeon, go through a room with ebony floors and furniture, black painted walls, and a black ceiling. It is a cozy room, with a couch, and a warm fire. A skeleton is sitting at a desk. He is wearing casual yet classy clothing, and half-moon glasses, reading a book in an unfamiliar, ancient script. He looks at the lot of you and says ""Hello.""

Here's why this is, in my opinion, a good trap. You don't just have the players accidentally set off a trap - you must lure them in - ideally in a way where they don't say ""I check for traps!"".

A history or arcana or religion check will speak of the ""black room"", a place a peaceful wizard will go once he or she has achieved immortality to live cozy and easily. This wizard, lonely, will not seek company, but when company stumbles into their room, they will engage them and seek a good conversation.

""Hello.""

The second the PCs engage this skeleton, be it by saying hi, asking them questions, threatening them or throwing a mace at them, the trap is sprung. The skeleton waves his hand, and the latches on the doors click shut. Soon after, there is a whooshing sound. If a player unlocks a door, they will find they are facing a wall - the room has spun ninety degrees. The walls are thick and will take much time to break through. Teleportation requires a line of sight, and there is no line of sight to the outside of the room.

Preface this trap by at some point putting an emphasis on every PCs favourite drink.

The skeleton says to one PC, ""Why don't you pour some drinks. I like brandy myself."" The rule is that only the player who is completing the challenge can speak. The player must pour each player's favourite drink.

The skeleton says to the next PC, ""Tell me, how did you meet the other three?"" Correct answer required.

The skeleton turns to the next one. ""Tell me, where was (PC) born? How about the other two?""

The skeleton turns to the last PC (designed for four). ""So, why do your friends keep you company?""

Once all PCs answer a question, the skeleton opens the doors, and the walls directly beyond the doors are seen. He says, ""So, which one of you three would like safe passage?"" Here, if one volunteers, the brick walls unfold and both lead to a dangerous place. If the other PCs elect someone or decide to stay together, both paths are safe. They lead to the other side of the door (before spinning.)

This is ideal for high-level characters as it is jarring - they expect magic or a powerful enemy or a demon or something, but are instead given a peaceful skeleton. If the skeleton is killed (He goes down in one hit, and doesn't fight back, just insists you stop) the room does not spin, and the PCs must tunnel through a wall.

I like traps, but never use them in combat. It just makes things complicated."

It's faster gold than the jungle (as long as you aren't competing for last hits with your laning partner), and better for the team. He's great in a utility role with items like Mek: he can farm it quickly, and he doesn't actually have much of a right click anyway so I feel like building him as a traditional carry is a waste. I've seen people get shadowblade on him, which is viable, but I prefer blink. As always, bkb is a good item. 

Jungle doom really isn't all that great. He isn't very good at ganking from the jungle before 6 due to his low mana pool, so he's a jungler that will weaken your lanes, similar to Nature's Prophet. Many jungle creeps were changed to give less experience a couple months ago, and I don't think it's worth running him as a jungler now because of that (except in corner cases such as your team needs to give another hero a solo lane other than mid, and you don't want to trilane for some reason. in that case, you can jungle doom so that you have two solo lane heroes). 

There aren't really any ""core"" items for him. You can get drums, mek, pipe, blink, shadowblade, sheepstick, orchid, shivas, even refresher. Doom is a utility hero, and that means that he builds according to the match. Of course, every hero should do that, but the point is that his item builds can vary a lot more than that of other heroes. However, I will say that Radiance on him isn't very good unless you're going into a hard carry role, and even then I don't think it's great (especially since there are better radiance carries than doom). 

As for viewing, I don't really know any specific players known for playing doom. However, you can use [dotacinema's vod section](http://www.dotacinema.com/vods) and sort by matches that include doom. It's an archive of virtually all matches casted by English speakers in the scene. "

Edit: Ok, I googled: 

*disclaimer, I think they are all very pretty girls, and some of my info here is guesswork based on my past experience.  I'm pretty good at guessing weights and heights.  I think Tara and Christina are simply on the higher side of the normal BMI and Eva is on the lower side.  None of these girls qualify as overweight or underweight.  They are all perfectly normal healthwise, so after that point it's just what you prefer.  

Tara is a US size 10/12 and 5'10""/170cm. Can't find a lot of info, but I guess she weighs about 170. To me, she doesn't look overweight, but she looks close. Normal BMI weights for someone 5'10"" is 130-175 (ish)  

Eva's googling got varied results.  It's pretty consistent she is 5'11"" but some of her measurements are ridiculous.  Like one site said she weighs 180, which I seriously doubt.  I'm 5'11"" and if she weighs 180 that would be overweight.  One site said 124, which seems more correct to me based on the photos. For me at 124, I am a size 2-4.  She has a similar body type to me, which is why I don't think in that photo she is a size 6 and is closer to a size 2. 

Christina seems to be 5'8"" and is reported being a size 8-14 by different sites.  She apparently weighs about 150.  At 5'8"" with her body type at 150, I'd guess she's about a size 10.  I think she wears a lot of shaping undergarments which suck things in, which is fine, most of us do, but it can definitely skew results."

OmniaMors,funny,1388732896.0,"thats not at all true. you see a gun can be used defensively. an oppressive agent of the government is a lot less likely to bust in your door when there is a loaded gun on the other side. a nuke, however, cant be used defensively.

i mean you could also argue in the same direction, since we dont need guns we also dont need knives right? i mean there is a spectrum of self defense methods from nothing to nukes. you have to draw a line so saying drawing it at guns is the same as drawing it as nukes is the same as drawingbit at knives. its the same logical fallacy as when people say ""gay marraige? next people wi want to marry toasters?!?!?!""

and if you really dont think civilians with guns could take on the government you really need to relook at history. i mean with all our bombs and planes and technology the US hasnt exactly beaten civilians with guns. like in korea, or vietnam, or the entire middle east. trust me when i say i know military technology. but at the end of the size and armament of the US population would over power its techbology any day. and that doesnt even include the number of soldiers that would side with the people.

as for sandy hook. gun laws wouldnt have stopped anything. i mean in china a mmn killed more children in a school with knives. and hell with access to nearly *any* supermarket and some time i could mmke a bomb to kill twice as many people. do you really think takong away guns would end murder or just mutate it to another medium? i mean take the swiss (i think its them or sweden) who have a larger per capita gun ownership than the US but much less crime."
23skiddsy,movies,1388732897.0,"Since when is physically playing with toys all day not getting exercise?

I'm not trying to be combative about this. I'm just very much into zoology and conservation. I despise what places like Sea World do, but you seem very set on the idea that captivity sucks for everything. But the fact of the matter is that we're very well aware of what animals in zoological institutions require, and we do our best to meet their exercise, social, and mental needs (and food and medical care, etc). The whole point of enrichment is to provide ""toys"" that meet the exercise and mental stimulation needs of an animal without requiring acres upon acres of space.

I think it's unethical for a wildebeest, being migratory, but big cats easily meet their exercise needs with the proper enrichment. Nowadays, cheetahs even get dog companions that are not only social companions (because male cheetahs hunt in coalitions with littermates), but they're also ""running buddies"" and they play and sprint together their whole lives. It's a recent development, but it's now becoming standard for young cheetahs to help meet their needs."

Morning.

Breakfast. Meet the innkeeper. (*His ale shipments have been coming late.*)

Errand 1. Weapon/armour upkeep. Haggle with the blacksmith for a fair price. (*He wants to sell weapons with a special alloy made by the dwarves, but needs a supplier.*)

Errand 2. Adventure supplies. Streetwise/spot checks to find the market stalls in a busy market. (*Guards mention problems with the thieves' guild.*)

Surprise! A noble's purse is taken. When found, noble offers lunch in the castle or estate. (*He mentions that someone has been sending him death threats.*)

Errand 3: Rations. Go to the rough part of town, where they sell cheap bulk food. Muggers try and take your gold. (*One of them has a note which has a mysterious symbol written on it, as well as a date and street name - the date is several weeks from now (Or whenever is convenient.)*)

Walking around, they find a travelling merchant has come to town with magic items! Let your PCs spend their hard-earned gold. (*He speaks of a powerful sword hidden deep within a dungeon.*)

The day is getting late, so they return to the inn for dinner. (*A man in the corner is claiming his business partner has been stealing from the coffers.*)

As the night goes on, the ale runs and runs. Soon, a brawl breaks out! (Unarmed combat rules, also assume players are wearing either light or no armour. Have bloodied foes knocked unconscious or run away. Also, have them ""fight"" each other.)

""Intersex"" itself isn't a condition, so much as it is an overarching category of conditions.

The ""correct"" one is whatever the intersex person feels most comfortable with. Which is pretty impossible to say when they're newborns. Hence why intersex activists are generally opposed to ""corrective"" surgery (to make the baby's bits look more male or female - something potentially irreversible) on infants, and instead, if not life threatening, to let them grow up as-is and figure out what the want to be.

JAWJAWBINX,autism,1388734435.0,"The issue here is that everything is defined. Autism is defined so that the low and high functioning are both autistic, in fact current research is pointing towards the possibility that the low functioning are in some cases not autistic at all and in other have some comorbidity which explains their functioning (be it neurological or psychological, though signs lean towards the most common being severe abuse which are likely due to environmental issues). Your definition is not only incorrect but applies to a shrinking minority, one that has (at least the individuals who have been capable of communicating to the proper degree) been vehemently against any attempts at a cure and would rather die than be made an NT. Furthermore when people talk about curing autism (lest they are totally uneducated and only believe  that the autistic are as you describe) are not referring to just those you are talking about but all of us, and many of them would be more than happy for the cure to be as ""simple"" as an injection of trapanal (in fact there are many who have suggested crueler means with the same end).

Given access to the same button most in the spectrum would not press it but instead would destroy it. The neurotypes are rather well defined and the definitions are supported by science. Of note is the difference between ASD and NT, each neurotype has it's own unique brain structure. We are different on a fundamental level and it is not as simple as being introverted, asocial, or stimming. An a typical trait, even an a typical neurological trait or a disability does not make somebody autistic or not NT but it is specific differences. What you think on the matter is as inconsequential as what you think of the definition of aardvark, others with more knowledge have used that to simplify things to a set of descriptors. Furthermore if we are to be compared to any set of communities it would be racial ones, we are not so simple as a set of common interests and appearances but are complex individuals and connected by a single trait."

And because there's no way to tell what kind of mental body mapping they're going to have, it's hard to say which way they'll lean. 

As trans friends have defined it to me: Gender isn't really a ""social construct"", it's what the body mapping portions of the brain (Studies show a difference in BSTc regions) say your sex should be. It can mess you up bad to have a brain that says ""you should have a penis"" and when in reality you don't. It's a definable thing that causes distress (dysphoria) in those that have it, and it is best treated medically through hormones and surgery to make the body fit the brain. 

...Though now that you bring it up, the biological species concept is a pretty shitty definition, but it's the best we can do. Fucking ring species seagulls."

Throw out the present, your pregnant so sex is not on the table for you do to pain dont make that an issue. you could if you wanted to but you dont so dont use that as ammo if your going to have a conversation with him.

Just because he enjoys what he did in the past does not mean he does not enjoy what he does with you in the present and future. For some men its a all for one sorta deal and there partners either deal or get them to stop.

Its just like porn viewing... only difference is that hes in this one. Hes with you! not her. If he wanted to be with her he would be more then likely and not with you. Since he is with you i think its fair to say that your his pick.

Jeff reconnecting with his dad, however, was something that had been set up, so it's something that they had to tackle whether they had a plan to do that or not. I think they were shy, however, about taking big swings with anything, I guess because a big swing that misses is *really* ugly.

naeve,AskReddit,1388735475.0,"Didn't see the ""demon"", but I ""felt"" something evil standing behind me. 

Last time it happened, I had fallen asleep in my recliner. Half-awoke for whatever reason unable to move my arms, legs, or jaw, and couldn't scream: could only make panicked grunting noises not unlike a child with severe autism. The instant I realized I couldn't move my limbs or speak, I immediately recognized it as sleep paralysis; I knew that some people experience the freaky hallucinations, so the only thing that ran through my mind was *""Oh fuck, wake up, fuck fuck fuck, wake up, please god please, I don't want to see anything, I don't want to see anything.""*

Flopped around like a fish out of water, desperately trying to wake myself up completely. I could hear impossibly loud footsteps scraping along the carpet behind me despite the fact that I was alone in the apartment, and though it sounded terribly like the footsteps were at a distance getting closer and closer, it felt as though *something else* was standing not an inch behind my chair, excitedly waiting for me to turn around and look at it. 

**I certainly don't believe in the supernatural or anything like that**, and still recognize sleep paralysis simply as the brain going into some sort of chemical overload as a result of occasional sleep deprivation (not in everyone's case, but that's usually the cause of mine). That wasn't my last encounter with SP, but it was the only time ""something else"" could be felt in the room.

Nothing about the comment would lead anyone to believe it was an attempt to ""scolding an OP for knowingly driving while incredibly high"". 

That said, you deleted the comment. Now, since I didn't imagine a need for a screen shot before, it's up to others who find this mess to decide what's going on.

If it had been wholly out of context and a misunderstanding on my part wouldn't it have been to your advantage to leave the comment alone? That would have been the normal reaction. However, you deleted the comment BEFORE replying to me with the following comment:

moose_man,fantasywriters,1388736412.0,"Brother Leogun Asmundvard

Monk of the High One's Order. Discovered the previous Vessel of Athanasios in the cellars beneath the monastery on Mount Agda, at which point he became the newest Vessel, though he was unaware of his role. After several visions and accidents as a result of his position as host of the god of fire, Asmundvard fled the monastery. He is currently searching for the secrets of the Fell and his own nature. Leogun is unsure and scared of his own immense power, but his faith in his god guides him in his journey for truth.

Prince Ragh Zel

Prince of the Fell and leader of the Legion of Souls, an advance force of Fell commandos in the Fell advance on the surface. When he learned that the people of the surface had forgotten that they imprisoned the Fell, he departed the army to follow after Leogun Asmundvard in secret. Dedicated to his people before the cause, Ragh is zealous but more measured than many of his comrades- and his father.

Elror Enu

Elroy is the half-Southern son of a Northern woman. Due to his dual heritage, he was often mocked as a child, creating bitterness within him that was capitalized upon by the Ebony Blade, a sword containing the essence of the god of shadows. The Blade transformed Elror in a way similar to Leogun. Elror traveled to Orthel and became a vigilante, acting against criminals he felt the city guard failed to. His brutal actions put him at odds with Leogun, a man he deeply respected when they first met. He is at odds with himself due to the split between the vengeful Enu of the night and the kindly Elror of the day.

Taisa nor Radan

A magus in the court of the Shining Emperor, Abaus of Brym. Makes friends with Leogun during their stay in the city of Arkaius during the Congregation festival. When the Fell appear, Leogun and his allies save many lives. She goes on Abaus' orders to discover the origin of the Fell, and Leogun goes with her. She is often arrogant, but is dedicated to justice and truth.

Falyn Renda

A former bodyguard of the Reharlean king, Falyn's family was slaughtered by rebels during the Ryasen Rebellion. Falyn took to alcoholism and wandering in order to find the instigator of the rebellion. When he met Alaire Delais, who reminded him of his young daughter, he pledged himself to protecting her, which led him to the path of Leogun Asmundvard when they stayed in the same inn during the Congregation festival of Arkaius. One of the world's best swordsmen. He is cocky and reckless, but loyal, clever, and skilled.

Alaire Delais

A young woman from the Argessonian Empire. Was forced to flee when a loan taken from the crown by her father went bad, leading to the death of most of her family. Doted on by Falyn. As a devout follower of the Northern Faith, when she met Leogun Asmundvard she stuck to him like glue, amazed to find one of the few Northern monks living outside of a monastery. She is naive, but principled, dedicated, and forceful."

ProtoKun7,doctorwho,1388736438.0,"There was *Mawdryn Undead* in which the two Brigadiers had to avoid coming into contact, and *The Big Bang* when the sonic screwdriver coming into contact with itself caused a temporal discharge.

I believe it's because Kazran (and Amy in *The Big Bang*) were fundamentally different to the younger selves they came into contact with. The Doctor was meddling with Kazran's past and so the child became different to the adult (even though they would become one and the same). The isomorphic controls stopped working too because of how different they were.

Amy was unaffected because this version of Amelia grew up differently; she was from a world without stars while Amy wasn't.

Rose's case is different because there weren't any other changes in her life to make her any different. The lives of both Amelia and Kazran were altered from the versions they grew up as initially, making them slightly different people. Rose's life was unaltered.

The screwdrivers emitted temporal energy, as did the Brigadiers when they came into contact. Kazran and Amy didn't because the childhood versions of themselves they met were too different and I suppose Rose didn't because it was consumed immediately by the Reapers."

Secret_Wizard,skyrim,1388736462.0,"I am Sweet-Seeker, the Argonian. I wasn't born with that name, but it is what they call me.

I was just an ordinary Argonian child, born to poverty in Riften where I helped my dear father fish off a small rowboat. I never knew my mother. We lived a simple life, a hard life, but also a happy one. Eventually, though, my father fell into debt with the Black-Briars. I guess Dad borrowed coin he couldn't pay back.

Before I knew it, I found myself thrown into Honorhall Orphanage. The Black-Briars were ""kind"" enough to let me keep my father's old boat. I kept fishing, every moment I was able to, without rest. After the tragedy, all I wanted for my nearing Nameday was a sweetroll. My most cherished memory... My father and I, sharing a sweetroll down on the docks at sunset. I wanted that again. Every Septim made brought me closer to my goal. I carefully hid my stash under a rock at the bottom of the lake, where no one could find it.

My Nameday came. I had enough money - just barely. I was so happy. Finally, I would have my sweetroll. But it was not to be. As I emerged from the Bee and Barb, prized pasty in hand, it was pulled from my grip by a group of older children from the orphanage. I couldn't even get a punch in before I was shoved into the mud.

The wind was knocked out of me. I could only sit and wheeze out protests as the bullies walked away with my dear sweetroll. The only thing I could think to do was go to the city guard... But I was met with laughter. ""Let me guess, did someone steal your sweetroll?"" they taunted... it was too much for me.

I left Riften that day. Blindly, I charged into the wilderness without care, cursing the names of all I knew. I wandered far across Tamriel for years, haunted by the unkindness of the world and all it had taken from me. I became a ""lunatic"" and a thief, stealing sweetrolls wherever they could be found, constantly trying to recapture the joy of that first sweetroll... But none were ever as perfect, and I was never satisfied.

And so my ""mad"" quest to steal and hoard sweetrolls eventually brought me to seek out the pantries of the Blue Palace of Solitude, in the dead of night. It was there, through mistake and misadventure, where I found myself in Sheogorath's court. There, my madness was understood and rewarded. The Madgod himself, in infinite kindness, bestowed upon me the Wabbajack, and with this godly weapon I would turn flesh to dough. With this weapon, I would finally have my sweetrolls.

**I would have all the sweetrolls.**"

jordanFromJersey,Marvel,1388739306.0,"1. Avenging vs Superior: 
When The Amazing Spider-Man was the flagship Spidy title, Avenging was a team-up book where Spidy would join forces with various heroes in short adventures. It was a lot of fun honestly. I didn't want to buy another Spidy book, but Avenging won me over. When Amazing ended and was replaced by Superior, Avenging soon followed suit and became ""Superior Spider-Man Team-Up"". SSMTU is more or less the same concept as Avenging, except that Spidy has more of a tendency to team up with villains in one way or another due to the current status quo. It's still a really good book. 

2. Avengers vs Uncanny Avengers. 
Avengers is the ""main"" Avengers title(and it pairs nicely with New Avengers, both written by Jonathan Hickman). Uncanny Avengers is a sort of mash-up title featuring a team of Avengers and Mutants designed to strengthen relations between the human and mutant communities. It mostly focuses on X-Men topics I think. 

3. F4 vs FF
So in the last run of F4(written masterfully by Jonathan Hickman) one of the F4 died and the book was ""cancelled"". In its place FF was launched(also by Hickman) and continued the story of the team while also focusing on ""The Future Foundation"", a school for genius super-children that focused less on saving the world from villains and more on solving the world's problems with science and cuteness. 

Eventually, the dead member of the F4 returned(in the most non-cop-out way possible, really, I promise!) and from that point on Hickman wrote both F4 and FF with F4 focusing more on the superteam, and FF focusing more on the genius kids. The books were designed to read together as sibling series.  

Hickman's F4/FF run is one of the best comics runs I've ever read and I highly recommend it. 

When Hickman was promoted to writing Avengers and New Avengers, both F4 and FF were relaunched with Matt Fraction writing them. 

This time however, F4 focused on the team(plus Franklin and Valeria Richards) as they went on a field trip/vacation through time and space, while FF focused on the remaining kids from the Future Foundation and a ""replacement"" F4 team who filled in while the real team was away(the replacement team consists of Scott Lang/Ant-Man, She-Hulk, Medusa, and newcomer ""Ms. Thing""). 

Fraction's FF has been consistently fun and quirky and kept alive a lot of what I loved about the Hickman run. 

Fraction's F4 however has been kinda middling though, in my opinion. It's currently building to a decent conclusion, but it sure took a long, boring, and tangential trip to get there. 

Both F4 and FF end this month. F4 will be relaunched with a new creative team, but as far as I know FF is done after this, which is a crying shame. 

Hopefully that answered all of your questions. :)"

I think many of my fellow Redditors on this Subreddit would disagree. My last thing I would like to point out is Al Fakher is an Arabic product.

manbearded,40something,1388740131.0,"I experience this exact issue. 

Before explaining my take on it - let me notify you that it's a compliment. If your ego is not satisfied by the idea that a woman you find attractive also finds you so attractive that she wonders how you are still single and without baggage, well then, your ego can't be satisfied. 
However, it seems as though you are a balanced dude realizing how women see a guy they are attracted to. They think you are hot, or at least marriage material, so they wonder why you aren't. Like they'd be more comfortable if you had a wart they could point to, but without the wart they go looking. Why? I don't know. It doesn't even help us to figure out why. What helps us is to figure out how to keep her interested despite her dissatisfaction at finding a wart on you. A reason why you are still a great catch even though you remain available after all this time. 

The answer is; she already thinks you are a great catch, so change nothing. It has nothing to do with you. Godspeed. "

TheDutchin,gaming,1388740301.0,"&gt; I hunted them down because I felt morally obligated to do so

And there's the issue.

The reason you don't see the Vault Hunters as anti-heroes is because you projected your own intentions and morals onto the character, morals and intentions they lack.

At no point do any of the Hunters express a desire to do anything, they're silent protagonists after all.  We create their personalities ourselves.

But if we're going to say they have set personalities, then the only thing we can go on is the audio files of their pasts.  This is a bit trickier.

Maya, I would say, is a hero.  She rebelled against the order that raised her because she discovered that they were using her as a pawn in morally corrupt operations.

Zero, on the other hand, is at best true neutral.  He kills for money.  He is on Pandora to Hunt the Vault, for personal gain.  I'd say that makes him an anti hero, a ruthless assassin killing everything that stands in his way to wealth.

I didn't collect all of the audio files for the other Hunters, so I won't speak for them.  Point is, it's incorrect to say the Hunters were heroes, but it was also incorrect to say that they were anti-heroes, because they were four different characters who for the most part, lacked personality."

Another thing to consider is location. Stelio is shown to be talented at playground bullying techniques, while the chicken is better at large scale fights through multiple backdrops. The chicken has an advantage if Stelio lets the fight drag on into multiple settings.

statusrobot,AskWomen,1388742372.0,"Abuse requires a difference in power, IMO. Abusers manipulate their partners into a submissive or victimized status in the relationship and then prey upon them.

If you're mutually horrible to each other, I would say that your relationship is massively unhealthy but I wouldn't call it abuse. Abuse is persistent, demoralizing, and unequal. If one partner is afraid to behave in certain ways because they know their partner will yell at them, or if their self-esteem is damaged enough by little cutting ""jokes"" and remarks that they allow behavior they otherwise wouldn't, or one partner consistently manipulates and invalidates the other such that they no longer trust their own emotions, then I would call those symptoms of abuse.

If you know that things you say hurt your partner's feelings, then stop saying them, even if you mean them as jokes. That's what good romantic partners (and friends and decent human beings) do. If your partner is saying something that bothers you, mention it to them. If you feel like you can't say anything about it, then examine why.

EDIT: Think of the term ""abuse of power."" To abuse something means you're doing something you're capable of but should never do. You're overstepping your boundaries and/or violating trust. That's abuse."

That's actually almost the exact opposite of the conclusion I reached!  Interesting how that happens hey? :) 

Wouldn't it be the heavily scripted, linear protagonists that could be viewed as good guys?  For a poor example but the first one that comes to mind, the protagonist of Resident Evil 4, Leon Kennedy, is a hero.  No two ways about it.  He goes to the foreign land where people are being turned into zombies and rescues the kidnapped presidents daughter, saving the world from missiles carrying the virus in the process.

statusrobot,AskWomen,1388742544.0,"Your last question is confusing me a bit because I'm not sure what situation you want to know how I'd handle. In a truly abusive relationship, I would hope that I would come to the realization that the abuse was even happening and then take steps to distance myself from it (and the entire relationship) before addressing anything with my partner, if I felt safe enough to do so.

The only time I came close to being in a relationship like this I was lucky enough to notice the red flags early on. I knew the guy for a few days and he immediately started doing these little controlling things, weirdly twisting my words back around at me so that I felt like the crazy one when I tried to call him out on it or set boundaries on communication, subtly putting down me and members of my family...it was really freaky how close I came to letting him get away with it. When I told him to stop contacting me, I had to escalate to being very blunt with him before he got the message, and even then he acted like I was overreacting - and honestly, I almost believed him. After that he started showing up at my church, where people noticed he had a tendency to try to isolate the 18-19 year old girls (he was definitely older than that) and behave in really slimy ways. He was really good at what he did and I didn't really know how an insecure 18-year-old would handle him when I barely could as a fairly confident 24-year-old. Thankfully someone there had a history with him (through a friend) and could attest that he was a controlling, manipulative jerk with emotionally abusive tendencies, so I was able to get some of the church leaders to run (subtle but effective) interference for the young girls in the congregation. After a while he moved to another city, and I haven't heard from him since."

MW3 was just rubbish. 10000 rounds per second guns and sniper rifles that can kill you through walls. The killstreaks were even worse. Juggernaut. Really? Overhyped two legged hippo covered in armor with a machine gun.

BO2 was supposed to be a change with the new class system and game modes. It wasn't. Launch day, launch week and launch month, you were guaranteed lag, bugs and hackers. Nothing was fixed until people started raging on the forums at which point people started getting banned and having their threads deleted.

Ghosts. No idea how it is. Didn't get it. Not going to. Not getting another CoD game. Not until the CoD4 dev team is set back up to make another FPS independently.

bananaruth,AskReddit,1388743069.0,"Woman here. I can't even imagine falsely accusing anyone of rape. First there's the moral issue: If you wouldn't falsely accuse someone of murder/grand theft/arson, why the hell would you falsely accuse anyone of rape? Most people would not do that, no matter how angry they were at someone. Think to yourself: Would I ever be angry enough to falsely accuse someone I slept with with murder? The answer is probably no right? (Gosh, I hope it is.) 

Second why would I want people to think I was raped? So I can get labeled a 'slut' or 'whore' or have people tell me ""It must have been because of what you were wearing!"". Do I want people to think I'm weak? Do I really want the interrogation that will follow? These things are not as flattering as you might imagine. (Note: If you have been a victim of sexual abuse, it isn't your fault and you aren't weak.) 

When I saw ""people who cry rape"" so highly voted in this thread, I literally sighed and rolled my eyes. Certainly no one condones that behavior. People don't condone it. Get it out of your heads that they do. More people seem to condone rape if you look at the numbers. That's what should really be on this list: Raping people.

shinyquagsire23,Android,1388743774.0,"Let me give you a good rundown of all the ""top end"" Android phones there are currently, starting with the ones you mentioned and ending with some that are popular with /r/andoroid atm:

**Galaxy S4**

This one is good if you want a well-supported and popular (to a certain degree) phone. There's plenty of cases and lots of good features, although the UI can be annoying for anyone who is used to stock Android. The only problem is that the S5 may or may not be coming out soon and if you're anything like everyone on /r/android you'll want to abandon ship immediately and get the new one. But if you're like most people you won't care as long as the phone is stable.

**Moto X**

The Moto X is good for it's stability and ""vanilla with sprinkles"" interface, sticking pretty close to stock Android while still adding a plethora of good features. It's small, so if you like the smaller iPhone form factor you'll be right at home. Not to mention that it's price dropped to $399 as of late making it a much better deal if you're wary of going into another contract.

**Nexus 5**

This phone is probably the best phone you can get with your dollar right now. You get the latest specs for only a fraction of the price: $350. I personally ordered one because I didn't want to go into a 2 year contract in addition to being able to unlock and root my phone with ease. But from the average user's standpoint, this phone is *fast* and *stable*, and keeps it minimalistic with minimal bloat and a clean, smooth user interface.

**HTC One**

This was another popular phone that came out early 2013. Like the S4, another one might be coming soon so be wary of that. However, it comes in 32GB and 64GB, so you get more memory right off the bat. Not to mention the spectacular camera and BoomSound which seems to block any other phone's speakers out of the water in that field. The unibody aluminum chassis has also recieved a lot of praise.

**LG G2**

I personally haven't looked much into this one, but it's the non-Google version of the Nexus 5 having more features and a much larger screen.


**Galaxy Note 3**

If you want a phone that lasts all day or a phone with a large screen, the Galaxy Note 3 is what you're looking for. It also has a lot of the neat fatures that the S4 has in addition to the S Pen features.


**Moto G**

This is pretty much the cheaper cousin of the Moto X with it's price starting at only $100 off-contract unlocked. From what I've heard it's actually not all that bad for a cheaper phone, and it's much better than any of the cheapo Gingerbread phones that they still try and sell nowadays."

A little basics: when car insurance companies take in monthly payments, they keep a certain amount of it that they expect to use to pay claims. The rest goes into stock portfolios, mutual funds, etc. with the hope that they will see positive returns and make money.

Now here's where credit rating comes in: the lower your credit rating, the more likely you are to not make your car insurance payment. All of this money-moving takes careful planning, and customers not paying their insurance can throw a wrench into this planning.

bananaruth,AskReddit,1388744778.0,"I appreciate what you are saying and I definitely take precautions. My biggest problem with this is: How much precaution is enough? Is it enough that my shorts extend to the tips of my fingers? Should I not stay out past midnight (like Cinderella!)? Should I just stay home? Surely that's the best way to prevent sexual assault (assuming I live alone that is, significant others can rape too). Taking that into account, maybe I shouldn't date anyone. Or make any friends. Or speak to people. Or look them in the eye.

So what is necessary then? As soon as you set a standard for what is 'safe' behavior for women, that standard will be deemed not good enough. Why? Women will still be raped and if that's still happening, then women are still doing something wrong.

There is always risk in this world. Every time you drive a car somewhere, you run the risk of ending up on the wrong end of road rage. It's unpredictable. You can try to prevent it by being the best driver you can be, but there will always be other people who are pissed.

I disagree. It's something that makes the micro harder, and I am strongly of the belief that the last thing SC2 needs right now is changes that makes micro and macro easier. In this particular instance regarding burrow and unburrow, I don't really care either way, but I really wanted to object to the sentiment that it needs to be easier when people who want parity could instead argue that other things should be harder.

About the auto-splitting, I think that's a bad example. Sending your workers to mine is something that a platinum player can do 99% as good as a Code S champion, so it's nothing that provided differentiation anyways. The auto-mining is there in case one player has a small hiccup in their computer, where they automatically get set back a second or two because of something that's (mostly) out of their control.

Emnems,AskReddit,1388745600.0,"I think the main confusion that others countries have about the states is how ginormous it is. Because of the size of our country, we have drastically different cultures in the various regions. I'm in the Northwest, and we (Oregon and Washington state) are pretty relaxed up here. Obviously there is crime but outside of the big cities it's not too bad. I'm a 20/f, work nights,  and I've never been in a position where I was concerned for my safety. 

There are a few hippy communes scattered around the area I live in, but mostly they keep to their selves. Pretty sure there is a few nudist camps as well. Actually it's legal in my city to walk around naked as long as you don't show signs of arousal, though very few people take advantage of this. There is a naked cycling group that goes around in the summer though. 

Most of the ""bad crimes"" are in the larger cities around the country and it seems that the east coast gets it worse. They are a lot more...ummm... motivated (?) than us. Most of the big corporate business is done on the East Coast. It's a lot faster and more stressful pace of life IMO. But then again, I know people who come west and think it's boring and too laid back.

I was in Ireland when the Aurora ""batman"" shooting occured in 2012 and was dumbfounded about how much press it got that far away. It was a horrible horrible thing and I grieve for everyone who was affected but it seemed like there was more press over there than here. Granted, we have also become rather skeptical here of the media and what they show. When we want to have an unbiased report of new article that happened in our own country, we look to the BBC. It sucks, but you have to take the bad with the good I guess. Then again, Oregon is also kind of known for being liberals with no trust in the government."

Recovery after alcoholism is often like rebuilding yourself and personality all over again. Now you're married so it's harder to separate yourself from him, but it doesn't have to be for forever. Even a six month separation and living apart for a bit will give you time to recover yourself and focus on your own happiness.

As for your husband, he's depressed and he needs purpose again but he's not going to get it without motivation from inside and care. You leaving him for a bit just might give him the kick in the but he needs to learn to live without alcohol and not just survive. 

If he relapses (and statistics say he likely will) then you'll most likely be having to face this choice anyways. You deserve to be thought of as sexy and important, not just a companion.

sworebytheprecious,confession,1388748191.0,"I don't know how to say this without it sounding weird so I'll get to it.

I'm friends with some people who are swinger's and I've been to their events. A startling amount of these swingers were in recovery from addiction. I asked a few of them about it, and for many of the couples it was that sex became a way for them to bond and feel good without inebriants.

But I think, digging deeper, it was more likely that they wanted another activity to bond over with the person they loved. It just happened to be sex for them. 

I'm not saying to run out and swing. Just that the first step might be simply to find an activity you both feel passionate about
 and the sex will come naturally once he's confident about himself and you."
bananaruth,AskReddit,1388748226.0,"Going back to the car analogy: I don't think wearing a seat belt is a good comparison. Wearing a seat belt or not is not an expression of who you are. Wearing one might be a small physical restraint - but it really doesn't prevent you from doing anything you might want to do. That's why I chose car color in my example. It might only be a small thing and seem trivial, but a lot of little concessions made out of concern for safety add up. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you don't lose anything by wearing a seat belt. (Sorry if my words are a bit jumbled or my thoughts unclear. It is also 6:00am-ish here and I have not slept since last night. I guess we're birds of a feather.)

At heart I'm a cautious person and I really do mostly agree with what you are saying. Life is a constant balance between liberty and security. It really is difficult to know what to do. I've been perfectly fine walking alone in areas at night and I've been followed while walking with female friends in daylight. You'd think three people would be enough to discourage creepy people, but apparently not. That one still scares me when I think about it. 

So I guess the point I'm trying to make is that while it is good to minimize risks, you should be careful that you don't give up too much freedom in exchange for safety."

Keep an eye out for posts pointing out potential and actual scammers.

dada_pants,writing,1388749726.0,"Interaction can reveal quite a lot. For example, John is a liberal and his colleague Max is very conservative. In theory both can set aside their political thoughts and work effectively together but I would argue, whenever there's disagreement, their differing views are going to show up. Doesn't necessarily mean they are going lash out shouting ""fricking liberal!"" over work issues but it is going to go through their heads: ""John never comes on time oh and he's also liberal so he thinks I should give away all my money so fuck him"" which would cause Max to argue more agressively about John being late. This is what makes people human. There is never just a single thought on our head, especially not about other people. There are always memories, judgements and feelings which are going to affect on what/how you think about someones actions.

So to flesh out your characters, I'd set them in a room and ""see"" how they interact with eachother. Or imagine what would happen if you spent a day with one of your characters - how would they interact with you? Remember, in real life there are no sidekicks, everyone is the protagonist of their own story. So what is your characters story?

3) I can't stand working in corporate america and feel like my spirit is dying every day that I go into the office and put up with the bullshit I have to put up with from day to day.

4) No job/franchise/life seems interesting to me and honestly I just want to not work and chill out until something appeals to me.  But I can't afford to do that so I work in IT making over 100k per year and I'm bored....seriously.

I feel like I should be grateful for what I have and the job that helps put food on the table, a beautiful car in the garage and great clothes on my body......but I'm not honestly enjoying this life/this job/this stuff.  I urn to help people and have a job that offers much more flexibility than my 8-5 job I currently have.

But then I think about all those that don't have what I have and I feel ashamed for these thoughts/feelings.

I find that more and more often I turn to alcohol and video games for escape and to forget just how unhappy I am.

What the fuck is wrong with me??

Am I missing out on life?? and if so....what does that even mean??

It isn't, it's still fucked up. God decided to knock up a little girl. Back then people also hit puberty later than today so she likely hadn't even begun puberty or had barely begun it.

rkh00,Damnthatsinteresting,1388753588.0,"Say you turned 20 on New Year's Eve. On the New Year's Day following, you can say that you were 19 the day before yesterday (so, the day before New Year's Eve, when you hadn't yet turned 20), and since your birthday is on New Year's Eve, your 21st birthday is in the same year of that New Year's Day. Threfore, your 22nd birthday is in the next year.

Ergo, if you turned 20 on New Year's Eve, 2013, then on New Year's Day, 2014, you would've been able to say ""The day before yesterday, I was 19. Next year, I'll be 22."""

Infringe is an interesting word, not often used in modern speech.  It is useful to look at its meaning in order to understand what the Founders meant.

*infringe: to encroach upon in a way that violates law or the rights of another*

Well - there's another word that isn't used very often anymore.  Lets look at what ""encroach"" means.

*encroach: to enter by gradual steps or by stealth into the possessions or rights of another*

So, when the Founders wrote ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"", they didn't just mean ""taken away wholesale"".  They had in mind the restriction or removal of bits around the edges - because they understood how government works."

On kick offs like that, if you catch it in the endzone you can take a knee and this is called a ""touchback"" and your offense will start their possession at the 20 yard line. If you catch it in the endzone and then leave the endzone, you cannot take a knee for a touchback. It then becomes a safety. What he did here was he got possession of the ball as he was stepping out of the endzone and then he kneeled down back into the endzone, essentially a safety. Had he caught it in the endzone and never stepped out of the endzone, his kneel down would have been a touchback.

""This cloudy, starchy pasta water is the line cook's secret weapon. You see, pasta water consists of starch granules and water—the exact same ingredients that go into a cornstarch slurry.

You know—the kind you use to thicken your sauces? Well, aside from just thickening a sauce, starch also acts as an emulsifier. It physically gets in the way of tiny fat molecules, preventing them from coalescing. This means that with a bit of pasta water, even an oil-based sauce like say, aglio e olio, or cacio e pepe will emulsify in to a light, creamy sauce that is much more efficient at coating pasta, making your dish that much tastier. Think of pasta water as the diplomat of the pasta world—he's the guy who's there to help your sauce and your noodles get along."""

shoryukenist,newzealand,1388757818.0,"You are really oversimplifying the situation.  In the North slavery was not ""accepted"" at all, it was illegal.  You may be aware that the Northern states could not just make slavery illegal in the South.  If you want to say that the Northern states have blood on their hands for joining a country in which slaves existed, I suppose I can't argue against that.  But they knew that if they were going to defeat the British in the Revolutionary War, they were just going to have to joint together, and worry about slavery later.  Many knew that conflict over it was inevitable.

Just to give you some information on the North, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 banned slavery in the territory that was to become the states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.  This was was 46 years before England did the same.  By 1804, every state north of the [Mason-Dixon Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason-Dixon_Line) had passed anti slavery constitutions, or laws.  When the State of Vermont was founded in 1777, it did not allow slavery.  Massachusetts judicially outlawed slavery in 1783.

So as you can see, the Northern States were ahead of England in terms of abolition.  But try as they might, they were not able to abolish slavery until the Civil War.  This is much more complicated than saying that the United States loved slavery until 1965.

My 50% quote was probably an overestimate, since the Southern States had a lower population than the North.

As for saying that many of our founding fathers were slaveholders, this is something we LITERALLY are taught in first grade (age 6), it is not a secret we try to hide.

But where you really, really, stray far afield is this statement:

&gt;As a bunch of separate colonies prior to 1901, and later when Australia was Federated, slavery was NEVER widely accepted or practiced in this country.

&gt;So we have a very different cultural consciousness with regard to matters of racial acceptance and intolerance.

You honestly mean to tell me that all of modern America has a completely different (and implicitly worse) attitude than Australia because we had slavery in the past?  You are telling me, that in the wealthy suburb of NYC I live in, that has a very high population of Indian and Japanese/Korean business professionals, that they are less accepted because South Carolina had slavery until 1865?  That is truly preposterous.  I can tell you that here were are very happy to have any hardworking, taxpaying people that support the town, we would be worse off without them.

Slavery was a disgrace, segregation was a disgrace, there is no denying that.  If you comments were directed only to the American South, and not the United States as a whole, perhaps your comments could be supportable to a certain degree.

I think you will find most parts of this country to be very, very accepting of different cultures, despite what you may read in the comments on reddit.  Do we have some rural backwaters, sure, but where doesn't?  I think we assimilate immigrants as good as anyone out there, which would speak against the your proposition that we are unable to get past slavery, even in parts of the country that never had it."

trisight,tall,1388758404.0,"The first bit goes quick! I dropped 20lbs the first 4 weeks when I first lowered my caloric intake and stopped all the sweets/fat intake. When I first started I didn't weigh until I had been doing it for at least 4 weeks so that I wouldn't be distraught from not seeing any immediate results. Then when I weighed and saw 20lbs lost, that was enough to keep me going. After that, I've been weighing every 2 weeks (on the same scale) on pay day. It's important to use the same scale because some scales aren't calibrated the same and can be off a little here and there and might show you as being a lb up or down (or be REALLY off in some cases).

I'm expecting to have gained possibly another 2 or 3lbs because of the holidays but hopefully lose some by my next weigh in resulting in a net stalemate. If not, I'm not going to let it get to me. I'll just hold my head up and get back on the horse and get back into the game. 

[Here is my spreadsheet where I've been keeping up with my weight measurements if you'd like to see.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArA-4zTGkFl8dHNRUTVlSG5tYjlGOXJsVy13V2NXOXc&amp;usp=sharing) You can see the losses are mostly small, but they are pretty steady for the most part.

He can effortless destroy your ship at his whim, and your captain must now conduct the ""walk of shame"" via shuttlecraft. He hasn't just overwhelmed your defenses and destroyed your ship, he's rendered it helpless and you must now bow to his wishes for your very existence.

Simply beaming the captain from his ship doesn't have the same effect. Remember he wanted Spock to *see* his planet destroyed. He could have simply killed him but he didn't, he wanted to show Spock he's better than him because he has the power to take what was taken from himself."

So if you can, get the MGS PSN game and read the history of the series found in the special features, then play through that. Make sure to watch past the credits, as they put spoilers there to make you wonder about the next game. 

Then get the MGS HD set with MGS2, MGS3, and Peace Walker. Again, mind the release date chronology, not the in-game chronology, and play MGS2. Read through the special features (they contain news articles and a short novel describing MGS1 and expanding on the storyline in ways that will flesh out the story for the actual MGS2 storyline).

Play through both Tanker and Facility chapters of MGS2 (and when you get to the end, be ready for another LONG cutscene!). 

MGS3 Snake Eater is next, then I believe it goes Peace Walker into MGS4 (which you'll be wanting to see again in this new light provided by all the backstory). Also, Snake Eater has both Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake as special features, so if you want to go back to 8-bit Solid Snake glory, give them a shot (they are challenging for an old MSX game)!

PortableOps (PSP) fits in there somewhere but I've never played that so I can't say just how or when it fits.

MGS5 (Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain, both) releases soon enough, so if you enjoyed MGS4, get ready by playing through the others."

It's clearly stated by Scotty that the transwarp beaming equation has been confiscated/classified by Starfleet Intelligence, they either don't want it falling into the wrong hands or recognise that they shouldn't have access to this kind of science as it would violate some kind of temporal prime directive.

My point being that transwarp beaming isn't a standardised technology across the whole of the Federation yet, it's still a very experimental and top secret technology.

As for why they don't use standard transporters, it's because the transporter tech of the time isn't as reliable.

my experience:  when you travel abroad, just be prepared to get sick once or twice.  it's just my weird personal theory, but i just feel like the viruses, bugs and bacteria are sort of *different* in a new country/continent.  if you're going somewhere you've never been before, there's a good chance you'll pick up a bug unlike any your bodies natural defenses have ever run across, and will therefore take a day or two to fight off.  if you're traveling, keep in mind you may very well get sick at some point, to the point of being all but incapacitated for a day or 2. just be prepared to miss a day or two at some point in your journey, vomiting and/or shitting water all day?  it certainly happens to a lot of people."

Once it's shoulder length it weighs itself down enough that I can actually make it go where I want. So for my hair, long hair is less maintenance.

I know there's a lot of girls who don't like long hair, but a lot do if you keep it looking nice. I get attention from women, I'm just usually too oblivious to notice until after the fact. Short or long hair I'm always going to have that problem, so I might as well look the way I want to look."

BonzoTheBoss,DaystromInstitute,1388760324.0,"I always attributed that to the fact that Klingons are good at reverse engineering other species technology, but aren't so good at engineering their own advancements.

It's heavily implied that most of Klingon tech was taken from the Hur'Q. This explains why during the 22nd Century Klingons seem to be decades ahead of Starfleet, but by the 23rd they're on par with the Federation and by the 24th they seem to be falling behind a bit.

Just look at the major technological advance of the Klingon Empire, the cloaking device. They didn't invent it, they traded for it from the Romulans!

This isn't to say that Klingons are stupid. On the contrary we see very capable Klingon scientists through out the various series. But rather the socio-economic makeup of Klingon society has always been more biased towards conquest and ""the warrior class"". This comes in ebbs and flows, as Captains Archer's advocate Kolos in ""ENT: Judgement"" states that Klingon society wasn't always so militarily focused, but that doesn't necessarily mean more funding was allocated to research and development either, as even since the days of Kahless were the virtues of the warrior lauded.

So I can't really speak to his attractiveness to other women, though I assume he does quite well for himself.

As for why you say you've gotten pilloried for saying the same things Brand is saying in this interview - well, one of you is paid millions of dollars to say humorous, slightly inflammatory things, and one of you is not. It's the same reason that IAC woman got fired for making a racist ""joke"" on Twitter that wouldn't have raised an eyebrow if it were written by Rob Delaney or Anthony Jeselnik.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1388761501.0,"&gt;The main theory within the red pill narrative I guess would have to be hypergamy.

While this one definitely applies to some women, it also applies to some men, and certainly does not apply to all women. I've seen a lot of guys on that subreddit make it sound like this is the default setting for all women - that we are, essentially, a pack of gold-digging whores bent on marrying the richest man who will have us, and that our hypergamous drive will eventually kick in and destroy our current relationships if we have not already ""married up"". They take a social theory that has some validity and run wild with it, taking it to an extreme and turning it into misogyny. 

&gt;Other elements I feel are sound are the rationalization of changing feelings based on partner behaviors (i.e. that women's feelings are more about how the man makes her feel than any intrinsic qualities in the man himself)

Again, that has *some* validity. But to say that women in relationships base their feelings on what they get from a man and not on *who he is as a person* is not accurate and just comes off as pure misogyny. As a woman, when I think about my husband and the way I feel about him, my feelings are based on who he is, on the things about him that are wonderful and admirable, and not just on how he fulfills my emotional needs. I know that this does not in any way make me an unusual woman - from what I've seen, this is a completely typical way for people to feel (both men and women) when they're in a happy relationship. They do with this idea what they do with hypergamy - take it to extremes and apply it to all women as if it's just the norm for us to be that entirely self-focused.

&gt;the concept of The Wall (i.e. that many women who have not settled down and had a family realise that they are no longer able to attract men as desirable to them as they were previously able to aka All The Good Men Are Gay Or Taken) 

Now that one does seem to have more merit than the others. There is a lot of pressure for women to put off settling down and having a family until we've played the field and spent a decade focusing on all-important career advancement; by the time you realize you really, really want to get married and have a family, your options have narrowed because a lot of the men you used to be having flings with have settled down and partnered up. I feel so bad for men and women who put it off and put it off, and then one day realize they've waited a bit too long. It was one of the factors that figured into my own choices that I made in my late teens/early 20s. I didn't want to have that regret; I wanted to spend my youth with the man I love and with our children. I was 19 when I got married, 20 when our first child arrived, 21 when we had our second, and 24 when we lost our third. I turn 30 this year and I have absolutely zero regrets about spending my 20s in that manner instead of focusing on a career - the idea of still being single and unattached during this season of my life makes me cold.

&gt;that men can make themselves more desirable as partners by doing things that actually matter to women (and that these are not what conventional wisdom tells men they are)

This one is okay too, although I think they miss the mark with their concepts of what it is that women really want from men. It's true that conventional wisdom often gives men a bum steer where women's wants are concerned. But these guys are even more wrong. They insist that women don't know what they want, because we're just too weak to know our own minds, and are easily confused - *they* know what women want, and that is to be dominated and controlled, to be a man's housekeeper and sex doll who tows the line or gets kicked to the curb. We want to be disciplined and we all want to be with rich men who will spend money on us, and we're all totes willing to trade sex to get it. Yes, that's totally what makes women tick. We loved it so much when it was the norm for us to be treated like second-class citizens that we started the feminist movement and fought to have the right not to have to live under anyone's thumb anymore. 

It's like these guys come *so close* to getting things right, but their sexism and anger get in the way and cloud their vision, so they are always missing the mark and going off on a tangent."

I was up against a Bronze 3 Teemo and got absolutely dumpstered because of my shitty laning skills. He was making tons of mistakes but I just didn't have the laning mechanics to capitalize on them, and I ended up dying way too many times. However, despite me being incredibly behind I knew the Teemo wasn't going to be a huge threat late game because he just didn't know how to play very well and made a plethora of terrible choices. I was in a team of four and told them to keep trying because I was confident that we could win, and they did. The random that we were with flamed me for the first 25 minutes of the game and I just kept apologizing but reassuring him that we could win. Finally he agreed to trust me, and despite me being 3-13 (yeah, I know) at this point we all tried our hardest. Sure enough we ended up destroying the nexus at about 55 minutes and I was right, the Teemo hadn't had any idea how to transition to late game. I ended up out-csing him by over 200. What I'm trying to say is the game isn't over as soon as a lot of people think. If one of your laners is 3-13 many people will just say ""GG"" and surrender, but that's not always the right call. "

Believers should never let themselves get drawn into discussing their deity's existence as an empirical phenomenon when they believe their deity insists on faith.  Any deity which insists on faith would never let its existence be proved to empirical standards.

The non-believer's mistake lies in failing to address a deity's existence as a philosophical question.  Numerous philosophers have tried (and failed) to [dis]prove the existence of a deity.  Inductively, we can reasonably conclude that it can't be done, so we all just stake out the positions that work for us.  This is alogical rather than illogical."

sir_sri,politics,1388762227.0,"Wealth != income.  Wealth is the sum total of your assets - liabilities, income is how much you collect every year.  


Imagine a world where everyone at 25 had exactly equal worth and income, worked until 65 and had pay increases every year due increased efficiency gains from  experience (and everyone got the same).

You'd still have a 'top 20%' making more than everyone else - and they'd pay more taxes.  That would be everyone from 57 to 65 - the top 20% of wage earners.  

But because most young people need to get a mortgage they are actually net negative on wealth until they have been working for whatever the duration of the mortgage is (say 25 years).  

So the *only* people with net positive wealth at all would be people over 50, and the ones with the peak worth would be people at 65, as you start to draw down  saving after 65 to retire. 

In that situation it would be ridiculous for the only people to pay taxes to be the ones over 50 - the ones who have a positive net wealth.

When it comes to the real world the barrier for top 10% of wage earners in the US is only about 100k a year for a 'household'.   

Oh and rich people have much more volatile income and  'wealth' than the rest of us on a yearly basis - values of stocks fluctuate and income can jump around a lot as markets move.  ('wealth' as  separate from wealth because it's pretty easy to convert something worth a lot of money into something that is legally worth  very little but that will magically bounce back at the right moment.  For details ask Mitt Romney how he made 5000 dollar a year contributions to his pension that in 20 years totalled 100 million  dollars.).  

I'm not saying the rich shouldn't pay a  fairly significant portion of taxes, they should, IIRC the optimum top tax bracket should  be about 70% or 74% (Which is where France's Hollande is getting his 75% tax on millionaires from, though it should start lower, I think about 300k a year in France and 400k a year in the US).  But taxing wealth is actually quite problematic and doesn't actually make sense when you consider what wealth actually means.  


Oh, and if you have no debt and 1 dollar cash, you're likely in the top 50% of wealth holders in the US.  Which is essentially the situation of every university student the day before their first tuition payment is made.

itsjusttoored,AskReddit,1388762711.0,"I'd give him the drunk consent bit, as that's a tricky topic. Consent is easy - yes is go ahead, no is stop. But introducing alcohol makes it more difficult. How drunk does one have to be for consent to become invalidated? People handle alcohol differently, so where do we draw the line? How do people tell when someone is too drunk to give consent - should we all carry breathalysers and charts on (I'm not an expert, so bear with me) mass/consumption ratios on what is acceptable for consent?

Then there's both parties being drunk off their arses - was it a rape? Who raped who? Invalidated consent the morning after also complicates things, as women and men (to a lesser extent) can claim rape if they didn't enjoy the sex or if they felt they were too drunk.

I agree completely with the skin though. As a guy, I don't feel compelled to rape every person showing a millimetre of cleavage and being presumed to think like that is offensive.

Immediate ninja edit: Of course, if someone is black-out drunk (I'm looking at you, Steubenville), then they obviously cannot give consent, and any previous consent is invalidated upon this occurrence. I was talking more about 'functional' drunks, but I wasn't sure if this was clear.

Ninja edit the sequel: On another note, things get even blurrier if the guy in a heterosexual rape case was drunk while the girl was sober. With the whole ""he's a guy, he said yes so he wanted it"" thing, added to poor support for male rape victims, it's just a bit ugh. It's offensive to men and women - men are purely sexual creatures and since their consent stands while inebriated, women are less capable of making their own decisions and are seen as weaker by the double standard."

It's compelling, and I've actually had a hard time putting it down...until I literally fall alseep on top of it because of the tedious tangents and explanation (which is Banks' poor substitute for actual exposition).  

He tells you so much about this huge world and these thoughtful characters...but then none of them do anything novel or relatable or even indicative of the personality Banks has *told you that they allegedly have*.  They just kind of do stuff, and Banks tells you what they are thinking.  He'll build up some kind of suspicion about an opaque/ambiguous character, then just ruin it by literally telling you what they are thinking about.  

It's also a little over-literary, and by that I mean it extends beyond Banks' actual capacity for eloquence.  Every dozen pages or so you just get smacked with a string of adverbs or a glaring cliche (or both, like he was trying to avoid using a cliche by throwing a modifier in the center of it).

It is disjointed.  There are a number of long scenes that serve the purpose, I assume, of tying/sitting Horza down somewhere so he can think for hours/days about things that are mostly irrelevant to his situation and the story, but are cool bits of worldbuilding Banks didn't want to leave out.

Anyway, all that moaning aside, I actually like the book well enough, despite its flaws, which aren't as major as the moaning would suggest.  I *want* to get into it, so I'm defending it to myself as I go.  It's one of his older stories that he rewrote after finally getting his publishing break.  I'm telling myself that he'll get better in the later books.  The only thing I worry is beyond his fixing is the telling-instead-of-showing, which is a really noticable flaw in his case.

Why did the equation have to be invented by Scotty? Why not LaForge? I guess the writers thought it would be amusing if Scotty in the alternate reality used an equation he supposedly invents in the future, but it still feels sloppy."

He says that twelve regenerations would ordinarily allow for thirteen versions of himself. Despite this, ultimately that didn't happen because of what the Tenth Doctor did.

River Song burned through all of her regenerations to save the Doctor's life. She was still only on her third body, not her fourth, fifth, sixth, and so forth. You're only a new incarnation if you enter a new body. That didn't happen."

Sounds like you were against this guy from the beginning.  I wouldn't have mentioned the drugs to my boss at any point, just makes it seem like you had it out for the guy.

Prior to him threatening you outside of work that morning you got fired:  sure, hes doing drugs on the job. A lot of people do - if he's wrecking vehicles because of it, he's probably not gonna keep his job long.  Going and 'telling on' people like this isn't really looked well upon in this culture.  Sure, I might have asked to work with someone else after he wrecked the work truck(were you in it when he wrecked?) - but I wouldn't have tried to get him fired over it because he was on drugs.  That is the manager's job to deal with, and if he doesn't - its on him, not you.

As a co-worker of someone, I wouldn't 'narc' on someone to the boss about drugs - let the boss figure things out.  If he asks, and you don't like the guy, tell him the truth then.  Don't be the guy trying to get people in trouble - let the boss handle that stuff.

And then you start talking about going to your boss's boss - thats a very quick way to get fired.  Could be seen as trying to get your boss in trouble.  Who wants to keep around the employee who is trying to 1) get his co-worker in trouble(for something that may be illegal, but is usually not a huge deal), and 2) get his boss in trouble

Seems to me you've got a problem with drug-users - you need to lighten up, there are a lot of drug users out there, you're gonna have to be able to deal with them.  Most of them are pretty awesome people.  Some of them aren't.  This guy offered to share his drugs with you(sees like a cool thing to do), and in return you tried to get him fired.  I'd probably be kinda pissed, too.

I'm not saying you were wrong, or right, but just giving you some of my observations.  You didn't get fired because of his drug use, you got fired because of how you reacted to it.  You've got to use a bit of tact to deal with these situations sometimes.

Good luck on the job hunt brother."

Jewelry is hard for me. I'm allergic to silver and a lot of other metals, so I can only wear gold, titanium, glass ect.  I am stretching my ears, so I can't wear normal earrings, I wear a gold heart pendant that I never ever take off ever (Deep and meaningful blah blah), and I feel silly wearing two necklaces unless they balance. I like bracelets but I always end up not wearing them. I guess if I bought cheaper stuff specifically for outfits it might work better for me. As for rings, I own two fairly simple gold bands with gems in them.

my house has similar set up with similar issues. I think that my #1 issue is lack of circulation, second to that is putting the heat/hvac where it is needed more.

windows, even new ones, are not as insulative as a good wall. Mostly the heat exchange occurs around the frames (often aluminum), but glass is a pretty good heat conductor as well.

If you lack an intake vent upstairs, i would say that is the most important thing. Secondly would be putting it where it needs to be, which could be zone control or doing something simple like closing the vents in the rooms that are too hot.

On topic of diving, I have quite a few friends that played it in their teens in quite high level. The problem in soccer is that you are very unprotected during those plays, even small kicks to ankles will accumulate during the game, and when those ankles will start to give up, lighter and lighter kick will take you out of the game. And referees are quite easy on those types of kicks if you don't fall down. And then in professional level there are some guys there will plain try to hurt you(think of slashing in hockey). So sometimes you just have to flop.

Red has problems with MoW (except via Banisher Priest), black has problems with BBoV. I prefer red here since you have at least one answer to Master, but none for Blood Baron.

Avistew,sex,1388764971.0,"I have an app that I use, but because it's meant for people who are trying to conceive, it only has ""had intercourse"" as an option. That makes it tricky to know what to say, not just for every other acts (which I definitely want to count) but for things like ""we had intercourse but he didn't come there"" which would defeat the point if trying to conceive, but not otherwise.

Similarly, that app doesn't seem to care is sex happens once or more than once.

On that note, I'm curious about your reasoning for only counted times that led to completion. Do you mean completion for either one of you, both of you, or you exclusively? I note you did not count oral sex on her, which could be because you don't do it, but could also be because you focused on your ejaculation, rather than sex with your wife?

That last bit is also supported by the fact that you included masturbation, which I assume in a lot of cases did not involve her.

my issue is that my old house only has one set of ducts run to the upstairs, which was installed when the previous owner (renovator/flipper) upgraded the HVAC. Instead of running two ducts in the hole and space that was chosen, they ran one giant puffy insulated deal. i guess all i really have to do is pull that and run some bent steel ducts. i can reuse the current exhaust vent layout, maybe add one and install a some returns in the bedrooms and common area, then tie those in with the main intake vent. As long as that is happening, it might be wise to find somewhere to install another return on the other end of the downstairs.

The best setup's i've ever see had one exhaust and one intake duct going to each room, with two vents per duct. One at the floor and one at the ceiling. You use the floor returns and the ceiling vents in the summer. You swap and use ceiling returns and floor vents in the winter.

Immediately my head began to clear and over the next few months I saw her for who she really was: a lying, cheating,  manipulative women who had her boyfriend and several other guys, including myself, wrapped around her finger. She was a cancer in my life and I cut all contact. I barely dignify her with a hello now. 

I heard she's engaged to her boyfriend. I also heard, from her old roommate who is a good friend of mine, that there were more other guys than the few I knew about. During the period of time where I felt that I was in love with this girl, I ignored her cheating and never once let it bother me. I even started to get angry that she wasn't cheating on her boyfriend with me. 

She represents a dark and cancerous time in my life. It was after I cut contact with her that I met people I can truly call my real friends and I reconnected with my actual best friend from high school.

Sadly there are people of both genders who have this idea in their heads that if someone is actively looking for a relationship then there's something wrong with them.

With guys the idea (in my experience) seems to be that the majority of women can get any guy they want so any woman who has to look for a decent man is clearly broken and with women it seems to be some sort of ""well, a guy who is actively looking just comes off as too needy and desperate, if he was attractive then he wouldn't be interested"".

OriginalStomper,bestof,1388765942.0,"I do not have the hubris to define a deity, but later in this comment I will assume certain traits for purposes of discussion.  And technically, I am not debating a deity's existence.  Rather, I am arguing that the debate is futile, so that any position about a deity's [non]existence must be based on faith.

If a deity were *no more than* random effects, then it would only be a deity for those who worship Lady Luck.  I don't believe anyone would reasonably make that claim about a deity, whether hypothetical or actual.  As you concede, any deity would have to be sentient.

&gt;Additionally, I disagree with your assertion that subjective impacts are completely non-measurable or observable. They are absolutely observable, in that people can tell you them.

Um, yeah.  Billions of believers report their subjective faith experiences all the time.  They report that greater faith gives them greater strength, hope, love, joy, peace, and courage.

But scientists (including atheist scientists who are subject to confirmation bias just like everyone else) discount those reports as not meeting empirical standards.  Truly, there's no way to measure changes in the level of faith and compare that to changes in the level of (say) hope and eliminate other variables and compare that to a control.  There's no way to run a double-blind study and exclude placebo effects.

I am not making an affirmative claim about a deity.  Rather, I am arguing about the availability of proof for a deity's existence.  I am saying that we have no good reason to believe a deity's existence can be [dis]proved. We have inductive reasoning to strongly indicate that a deity's existence cannot be [dis]proved to logical OR empirical standards, and this is supported by the most commonly held beliefs about every deity -- that a deity is powerful, wise (or at least cunning) and *insists on faith*.  We certainly have no reason to believe that, if a deity exists, it would allow itself to be subjected to empirical testing, and in fact the inductive reasoning strongly indicates that no deity would do so because no deity has done so.

Godel proved mathematically that Descartes was right -- we all have to embrace some assumptions if we want to get past ""I think, therefore I am.""  Thing is, there's no logical justification for assuming (much less insisting) that everyone share the same assumptions.  People who start from different assumptions will logically reach different conclusions.

So if you start from the assumption that everything real can be tested empirically (Naturalist Philosophy), then you can logically conclude there's no deity because there's no empirical evidence for a deity.  If you don't start from that assumption, then you can logically reach a different conclusion.  The [non]existence of a deity cannot be established to logical or empirical standards of proof.

Sure.  That's a reasonable position for you to take IF you start from the premise that everything which exists is subject to empirical observation.

behindtimes,truegaming,1388766650.0,"I'm looking at overall impact.  By what I'm interpreting out of your definition, wider adoption = more influential.  I don't necessarily agree with this, as the latest and greatest will almost certainly have a wider adoption rate due to more people overall.

Now, I will agree to an extent that we can't just say ""Well, would this have existed without that?"".  Otherwise, Quake wouldn't have existed without Doom, Doom wouldn't have existed without Wolfenstein 3D, Wolfenstein 3D wouldn't have come into being without Ultima Underworld, etc.  There will always be some game that did something earlier or was influential on the later.

Rather, I'm looking at what brought in gamers and terminology into their lexicon.  While Wolfenstein 3D was one of the earliest FPSs, I don't think it was the most influential.  Sure, people were copying it, but the moment you could play against another player, people forgot about it.  No offense to id or anyone, but really Wolfenstein 3D has become forgotten.  But bring up Doom?  Everyone knows Doom.  It's similar to The Elder Scrolls.  Does anyone really remember Arena?

What's popular changes over time.  I'll admit, being a gamer who prefers older games I get a little distressed on reddit quite often when people say ""Hey, anyone remember this obscure gem?"" where the obscure game happened to be one of the most popular games of the day.  When I think of influential, I try to go back in time and see the earliest game I can remember that has public awareness.  The fact that people still know Doom two decades later I think speaks a lot about it's influence. (And yes, the game is intertwined with it's engine, but doesn't change it's influence)."

See someone who can. I know people hate the idea of seeing a shrink, but you're an athlete, if you broke a limb would you just sit there and wait for it to get better, even though you need it in order to be good at running?

It's good that you're telling people about how you feel. That means you want it to get better. If you want it to get better, find someone who can help you. And that's not a girlfriend, that's a therapist.

You're still young, seem healthy (body-wise), smart and nice, so I'm not too worried. But you should prioritise your mental health because that's what most likely gets in the way of changing your life for the better, or even just enjoying the life you do have.

If you meet someone, great. But as long as you're depressed it might not help that much. Your ""I'll never meet someone"" could easily turn into ""I'm not worth her, she's going to leave me"" or ""she'll realise she was wrong to love me, because I suck so much"" or ""she's not really attracted to me, she must have an ulterior motive"" or whatever.

And then if you do drive her away with constantly telling her she deserves better or questioning her love or attraction, then you'll be depressed about blowing it instead.

I understand being single sucks, and a lot of people have a partner before they're 24. A lot of other people meet their first partner later than that, and have happy, fulfilled romantic lives, so no, hope is not lost for you, to answer that part of your question.

But it's going to be hard for you to believe as long as your brain is making you feel like crap pretty much constantly. Get rid of that, and then you'll be able to make decisions with a clear mind.

The fact that you wrote a post means you want to find another solution, you don't want to kill yourself, you're just feeling like it might be the only way. Well the other solution is there, and it does take a lot of effort on your part to initially set it up, but then it will get better."

Similar to Irukandji jellyfish. Personally I'm more scared of all the sharks. In the far north I would be equally concerned of jellyfish and saltwater crocs.

Not sure what you are referring to here

Cone snails again are mostly I believe common in northern states however I think the blue ringed octopus is much more widespread. Just don't go wading through rockpools.

 There are many dangerous creatures here but you sorta get used to it. For example in summer eastern brown snakes are common where I live. If you see one outside you just keep away from where you saw it. There are too many deadly things to let them control your life. Just stay near the hospitals and you'll be fine :)

She still asked me to help her with stuff and hang out but if I mentioned I liked her she would say stuff like ""i'm not ready for a relationship right now"" blah blah blah. Which I totally understand. I wouldn't date me either.

Then we went to different colleges and I reverted to before I met her because she was a stabilizing force. I would stutter and throw up and cry whenever someone made eye contact. Then I tried to kill myself got removed from college and now I'm going back...tomorrow. 

EDIT: It felt hopeless.. But now your together.

Aprikoat,summonerschool,1388767999.0,"TL;DR: Nocturne because he is more well-rounded and trundle is a very very niche pick


Trundle sucks against everyone but melee AD duelists like lee sin or udyr and tanks because of his stat stealing (Q steals AD and gives it to him; ult steals % health and defensive stats and gives it to him) and his ganks are really unreliable because he has no hard cc and he can screw up the pillar pretty easily (his counterganks and counterjungling are fantastic though). He also takes it up the ass from poke comps because they can just poke for years and he has no answer to their harass come seiges.

Nocturne has way better pre-6 ganks due to his fear and spellshield and as long as you can aim Q he has stupid damage and post 6 he has some of the best ganks in the game because of his ult, which doubles as a fantastic initiation tool and generally good utility skill because of all the vision denial.

Both are rather snowbally and tend to fall off pretty hard if you don't stay farmed and make plays but nocturne still has better utility imo because of his hard cc, spellshield, and vision reducing ult whereas trundle has a pillar and superior 1v1/counterjungling."

Sexy Italian women? Well, every country has sexy women.

Italian art is art, and art is about sensations, even if they come from the visuals. Let's do a better example: Compare the mainstream italian movies with the mainstream american movies.

iloveteax,vegetarianketo,1388768352.0,"I used to do pescatarian keto. My diet consisted of eggs with cheese every morning for breakfast, string cheese or tofurkey deli slices with cream cheese for snack, salmon/tuna/tilapia for dinner with steamed veggies. Sometimes I would snack on berries, too. 

I lost quite a lot of weight, and I lost it quickly. For reference, I was about 140 when I started, and 130 about two weeks into it. The only downside is (and this is true for any sort of keto) the moment you stop the diet you gain all the weight back. Also, being pescatarian and doing keto makes your diet extremely boring. "

ahhh_ennui,electronic_cigarette,1388768408.0,"I use all the stock parts for my Protanks 1 &amp; 2 (EVODs are the same head, I think?) - I'm just replacing the coil and wick. The hardest parts for me (but by no means intimidating, just some concentrationface happens) are:

*  threading the cotton through the coil (can be frustrating, but it's usually an indication that I'm trying to stuff too much cotton in), 

* keeping the coils lined up while getting the rubber (silicone?) grommet and pin back into the housing, and

* trimming the excess wire to be completely flush once the bottom pin is in.

My tools: wire cutters, my MVP2 for making sure there's no short and I'm in the safe ohm zone, a small torch for heating the Kanthal (my favorite part), needle-nosed pliers (tweezers work well, too). I wrap the Kanthal around a 5/64 drill bit - 4 wraps gets me around a 1.8/1.9 ohm, 5 wraps gets me in the low 2.0s (roughly). Once I get a lower-gauge Kanthal, I'll try my hand at microcoils. I use a smaller drill bit just to thread through the coil and hold it in place while I curse at the grommet/pin to keep it lined up correctly.

Because I'm old, I must also have good lighting and reading glasses. "

Venne1138,AskMen,1388768452.0,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.
That said.
In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.
I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.
I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.
The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.
I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.

All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?

no_real_username,AskMen,1388768485.0,"Everyone has things they find attractive and things they see as unattractive. If that is *all* that matters to you, it's shallow, but that it matters *along with other factors* isn't (IMO).

Like others have said, talk about it with him. Neither approach is going to be pleasant for him, but I think if I were the BF, I'd rather have the one honest, direct conversation about the problem, than an endless stream of subtle and not-so-subtle hints that just wear me down and make me feel like crap all the time. Get the talk over with, once and for all, so it becomes a shared project you can both talk about openly, and not just something he feels he's being silently judged for. The straightforward ""I need you to lose some weight. Can we work on this together?"" is probably more productive than all the world's insidious ""should you really be eating that"", or ""why don't we go to the gym for an hour"" comments.

Hopefully, if you're supportive of him, you can work on the issue together. Worst case, he's going to say ""tough luck, I am the way I am, take it or leave it"". And then you'll have to decide whether to take it or leave it... (but then at least you haven't lost anything by trying the direct approach first)

If he's open to working on the problem, face it together. And try to put yourself in his place. You'll likely get farther by siding with him than just by pushing/motivating/whatever him to do it himself. And remember that there can be a lot of reasons for weight gain. Some genetic, some hormonal, some related to mental/psychological issues, and some just down to lifestyle/habit. There might be more to it than putting him on an exercise bike for an hour per day and eating only salad for a few weeks."

&gt;Nolan says most states are already working to help Medicaid recipients get care in more appropriate settings. ""Things like nurse-advice lines, trying to work with the community clinics and community providers to expand hours and make sure that people who are working two and three jobs can get access to primary care after hours and on the weekends,"" she said.
