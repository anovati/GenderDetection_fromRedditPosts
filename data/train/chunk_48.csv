http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/new-religious-movements/

""Today in Canada, the most prolific of the new religions are continental in nature and not essentially Canadian. Evangelical and Charismatic groups which attempt to recreate biblical, or ""New Testament,"" Christianity are the most common. An important feature of such churches is their global scope and willingness to adapt beliefs and practices from all over the world. One of the most successful of these movements is the Calgary-based Victory Church. It was originally founded in Lethbridge by George and Hazel Hill. Today it is a growing denomination with over 100 local congregations and significant international links. In 1995 the Victory Church movement, led by its Lethbridge congregation, successfully challenged the CRTC's ruling against religious broadcasting and is pioneering independent religious broadcasting in Canada."""

It's only a contract for men. Of course you're going to use the tag line ""There's something to be said for..."". Yes, there is something to be said for a man giving you everything he offers without legally enforced reciprocity on your part. If I could get that deal I'd be trying to add artificial sentiment to it too.

This is me. 

I can totally see your point man. But I need to tell you something important that I keep forgetting but keep having to remind myself, **this is your life**. Do what you want, go where you want, etc etc... Don't let your parents tell you what/who you should be.

I'm in the same spot though, money isn't too much of an issue, but I just can't decide what to do out of so many enticing options. It's rough. I figure I just need to get myself to university, just dive in and maybe everything will fall into place. That's all I can do. I thought about taking another year off, but really that would just make me more miserable. I'd be just as antisocial, just as undecisive. Yes, the time off would be nice, but i'd be in the same spot and I don't want that. I just want to be doing something.

If I were you I wouldn't hesitate seeing your doctor and talking about how you feel. He/she may have some recommendations for you. Just gotta get the ball rolling and hopefully the world starts to make sense for us.

Makeup is not part of that. I don't pretend to be anything I am not, and personal hygiene is largely something that happens to other people. It's not just makeup, any attempt in my mind to control what I present to the world is going to be offensive to me. Things that you normally would not think twice about, like shaving my monobrow.

You have a responsibility to your shareholders, your employees and your community to locate in a readily accessible location, and that is NOT the middle of a city.

I agree with the decision to live where you work.  I built my house as close as I could to where my employer was located.  But that's not just my responsibility.

But she does. And after about five of them it becomes clear that this is going to be an outstanding workout. Any passerby looking through the garden gate may think that she was jumping in slow motion. 
But was she? Her feet lift up from the ground and they don’t return when you would expect them to. 
It appeared to the outer world as if she is…flying? 
As soon as there is a steady feet of air under her soles the narrowed eyebrows turn into wide open eyes and red freckles showing up all over her cheeks.

Doxies like or dislike cats just like people do. A puppy may be far too rambunctious around a cat, for example, while a seasoned senior would probably be apathetic or at least tolerate them. Depends on the dog and their previous (or nonexistent, in some cases) interactions with them.

FYI: If you do a search on Petfinder, for example, there is a section where you can filter out ""good with cats"" (actually, it's called ""My Household Has Cats"").

Which brings me to a question for *you*...

If you already have two pets, will your apartment complex allow a third?

I've never known an leasing company to allow more than 2 dogs/cats per leasee. Not around my area, at least. Please double check on this **before** you go out and adopt/buy a dog! Your strong desire to be a first-time dachshund owner is not worth getting evicted over!

A treatable mental illness is more akin to a broken arm than a basic flaw in ability to think rationally, logically, or in a scene context.

A frank discussion of the particular illness, the treatment, and signs of relapse is important. Together a pair of knowledgeable people can deal effectively with many illnesses, some mental.

One must never never use the mental illness as an arguing weapon or shame tool.

&gt; And even if the pay gap is zero, even if men make more money, that's not an argument against Lilly Ledbetter right? All that the law does is make it so that you can sue someone for pay discrimination up to 180 days after your last paycheck was issued rather than 180 days after the decision to pay you that much was made. Who cares?

The Lily Ledbetter Act is actually a bad law.  It allows people to sue for supposed discrimination that occurred decades ago - as it did in the signature case, based on employment discrimination that supposedly occurred two decades before the case was filed.

In the interim, people involved in the case died and records were quite understandably lost.

Consider what would happen if you were to go back and file a lawsuit against a school you went to, based on a grade you got in the first grade on one particular test.  Do you think the school will still have records of the test?  What if the teacher doesn't either, or has forgotten or died?

It's why solving in your head isn't always acceptable; you get the right answer but fall to learn a method which you need to solve more difficult problems later.

In this case I see zero method arguments that could be made, especially since the principle of selecting either as a divisor arriving at the other is an important nuance to teach.

The only difference would be if they were solving for something  specific. Imagine: Jane wants her garden to be 20sq ft and needs one side to be 5 feet. How long should the other side be?

In this case, 20÷5=4 is correct and 20÷4=5, while not being  mathematically incorrect, fails to answer the question being asked.

Maybe I didn't get my point across in a best way possible, I'm just trying to say that Kendrick has more complex rhyme lyrics, while Cole is a lot closer and easier to understand because he's using less complicated rhyme schemes, metaphors,etc., and that doesn't make him worse rapper than Kendrick, just less lyrical."

There was no one in the store at the time and this urge just overcame me and I went over to her and dropped my pants. She was already wet and that got me hard so I just dove straight in and went to town. It was over in about 10 minutes I held my hand over her mouth to keep her quiet but there was still that smacking sound of me taking her from behind.

Read the opening and closing paragraph of every section. This should give you the key information of that section. You should be able to close the book and summarise each section in a few sentences. The remaining information (subchapters) are then the details within those sentences. So instead of learning the questions from statements verbatim, you should be learning their core arguments: the things **they** identify as important. 

Each section of a book should work on the same level. So paragraphs: key information should be introduced in the first sentence, and concluded in the last. Chapters: first and last paragraphs. Books: Introduction and conclusion sections. It's an approach we call 'top and tailing' where I work.

Turkstache,flying,1391116293.0,"I'm sure you've already noticed how a student's inability can easily destroy your situational awareness. Just keep one thing in mind that has saved my ass a dozen times...

It doesn't matter how professional you're trying to be... if a student is **frozen** on the controls and his inputs are going to get the both of you killed within 30 seconds, hammer the insides of his elbows, the back of his hand, his chest, or his nose (last resort). You can deal with the consequences of that once you ensure the plane is safe again.

I've had students pull yokes to their chests and hold on with white knuckles immediately after takeoff, shove the yoke forward and lock their elbows, pull mixtures completely out and hold on tightly, start a quick roll and (again) hold the yoke in position, point the aircraft at buildings and trees... all within 100 feet of the ground in the traffic pattern, each of those examples *many* times. Most, I've been able to overpower. Some have walked away from the plane with bruises, lessons learned, and no complaints.

And for goodness sake, don't ever let the student be enough of a distraction that you forget to look out for the plane. I can't tell you how many people I've seen just flying crazy because they couldn't handle their students. Either way, the crash is going to be your fault in the eyes of the media, the company, the student's family, the NTSB, and the FAA, for not paying attention or being too polite to save yourself. It doesn't take long to go from input to crash. Stay frosty."

since herbalism is the only thing affected, you only need enough of this slowly-forested area to support herb collection.  Hunting and gathering can continue in the aggressively forested areas without a problem.

Ignaddio,pics,1391116456.0,"When water solidifies into ice, it arranges into a lattice structure that aligns the partially negative oxygen atom in a water molecule with a partially positive hydrogen atom from two other water molecules; the exact geometric arrangement changes depending on conditions, but at any rate it forms a continuous crystalline lattice structure.

The polar sodium and chloride ions (or whatever elements are in the salt they use) attract a bunch of water molecules in a different geometry (positive sodium ions attract the oxygen side of water molecules, negative chloride ions attract the hydrogen atoms) that disrupts the crystalline lattice. 

In order to form the crystalline lattice the individual water molecules need to be moving more slowly before the forming lattice can successfully attract them and polar forces orient them correctly. It also tends to push the ions out of the crystal, either to the edge of the ice or forming little pockets of salt inside the larger ice structure, again depending on conditions at the time of freezing. This is sort of like how you get little liquid pockets of sugar water inside a popsicle, which gives it its texture.

Before I could get my ID out of my wallet, the teller had swiped my card and handed me a keypad to enter a new PIN.  No ID required at all.  (wtf?)

When I called their HQ about it, I talked with someone in their security/fraud department who basically said I was getting all bothered about nothing because I hadn't lost any money.  So now I have two accounts at that credit union with almost no money in them because I know that if I lose my wallet, any random fucker who finds it could waltz into a branch, set the PIN to whatever they want, and suck every last dollar out of my accounts at an ATM (up to the daily ATM withdrawal limit, at least)."

AnotherCrazyOne,webdev,1391117020.0,"I don't like how they come off badgering you with ""duty of care"" and ""morals"" to help them. Not one bit. You say you'd rather not get involved with that client again. Sounds like they were troublesome to work with. Judging from the badgering they're doing now that seems self evident. I'd just be frank with them. The work was done, the contract was fulfilled. You have no obligation to work for them.

It would be best to kindly turn down their request and just let them know the contract was fulfilled and that you are unavailable to take on their work if they request a new work contract. Make it brief and to the point. Don't argue with them. If they reply back with ""but, but, yada, yada,"" again, don't argue. Simply restate the contract was fulfilled and that you are unavailable to take on any new work from them. Then don't reply to anymore communication from them. If they have legal grounds, if they take it to legal, then you'll have to deal with that when it comes. I assume you have legal respresentation. Just have them look over your contract and the situation as they would be better at this than anyone on Reddit if you are really concerned.

As this client is leading with badgering they're most likely all talk and no action. They really went about this the wrong way. They could have asked for a favor instead of badgering you if they didn't want to pay. They should have offered to pay you though to be right about it. They should have enough morals to know the contract was fulfilled and enough morals to understand that any new work is to be paid for, enough morals not to badger you, guilt you or pressure you. But they don't.

I would have no interest in working with this client further without reasonable communication and reasonable compensation. If you do choose to do more work for them, make sure your contract is clear and charge a fair price for working for them. Make it worth your while, but fair. You stand in a position where you can be the better person, help them, charge them, keep a cool head about it and walk away after you fix things. Be on guard with them, be firm. You did your job.

Something has changed that before the change, the payment system worked fine. Now it doesn't. This is mostly like due to an update to the SagePay API, a php upgrade, a MySQL upgrade, an upgrade to Magento, an upgrade to the SagePay extension or something somewhere has depricated. It's not a bug necessarily, but a change to the way things communicate somewhere. This is an extended support issue, something they aren't paying you for, something that wasn't in contract. It's not your bug. Further, if their developer is worth any amount of beans to them, that developer should be familiar with being able to troubleshoot something like this. This isn't a fully custom code site so whoever they hired will be able to do what they need to do. They may have hired the wrong person."

""Twenty-one people were struck and killed by drivers while walking the streets of San Francisco last year, the highest number of pedestrian deaths since 2007 in a city where three people on an average day get hit by cars or trucks.

Until December, 2013 was shaping up to be an average year in the city for pedestrian fatalities. But in the final month of the year, the death toll spiked, with six pedestrian deaths, including two on New Year's Eve.

Six-year-old Sophia Liu was in a crosswalk at Polk and Ellis streets near the Civic Center with her mother and 4-year-old brother when she was hit by a car. Zhen Guang Ng, 86, was run over in a crosswalk at Rolph and Naples streets in the Crocker-Amazon neighborhood.

The recent spate of pedestrian deaths and serious injuries has refocused a spotlight on a problem that city officials for years have vowed to address and that pedestrian safety advocates say needs more aggressive attention.

Despite San Francisco's reputation as one of the most pedestrian-friendly cities in the U.S., close to 900 pedestrians a year are hit by automobiles, and the number has been growing in the past few years."""

Not my intention to amuse. I just asked for proof and what you provided wasn't compelling.

That's not a fair argument, nor does it prove your claims. Chopping people up into digestible bitesized buzzwords only dismisses them so you don't have to entertain counter-arguments. It's dishonest and it's cheating.

I want to believe you, and I respect your concern for our rights, but I just do not see the evidence pointing to tyranny by concerted effort.

If someone is petty enough to not want to be your friend because of your age, then they probably aren't a very good friend to begin with.

Don't focus on ages. Focus on what it is you like about these friends. Maybe it's a certain hobby you guys have in common, or some other interest you share. And friendships are a two-way street. Why not invite some of your friends over to your house, or out somewhere that doesn't have age-restrictions? 

And don't let relationship experience intimidate you. It's not a competition or a measure of someone's worth if they've dated people already. You're 14, you have so many years to gain dating experience. "

* DONG har godtnok underskud 'lige for tiden', men ellers var kapitaldudvidelsen for at de kan bygge flere f..king vindmøller, som er en 'garanteret og guld-randet' investering (citat: Danica Pension i Børsen Invest), som de danske elforbrugere er indlagt til at betale for over skatten, fordi staten garanterer højere priser over en lang årrække. Det er muligt DONG har tabt 4 mia.kr. i år, men de har trods tjent 13 mia. kr. de foregående 4 år - og det jo mest gas markedet og Connie Hedegaard og hendes EU tumper med deres 20-20-20 plan, der alligevel ikke virker, plus [bivirkningerne](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21569039-europes-energy-policy-delivers-worst-all-possible-worlds-unwelcome-renaissance) af amerikansk skifergas (der virker mht CO2). Det har ikke meget med ledelsen af DONG at gøre.
* De svage får flere penge hvis vi sælger DONG.  
Det forholder sig omvendt, alle inkl svage betaler de høje elpriser, ca. verdens højeste detail-priser, ca. 10x produktionsprisen. Og de bliver endnu højere, når nu private investorer skal have deres penge igen. Og nej, du kan ikke vælge DONG fra, kun start-leverandøren. Det er TDC om igen.  
* Jo bedre forretning for GS, jo bedre for DK  
Jeg forstår simpelthen ikke logikken i, at en stat går ind og bygger en monopol forretning op (i praksis), og når så monopolet virker godt, så bliver det solgt til højere pris, fordi kunderne er tvangsindlagt. For mig er det bare ikke markedsøkonomi, det er kapital-sponsoreret kommunisme.

Well, I read up some more on the Ne, Ni thing, and I concluded that I have more extroverted intuition than introverted intuition. 

For sensing, I get much more raw information from memories. My information intake from current situations is foggy, and it slowly seeps into my brain and collects, eventually into a memory, which is usually somewhat stronger. 

For thinking, I think you hit the nail on the head for clearing it up. While there is some weak Te in there, the Ti is definitely stronger.

For the loyalty thing, I don't think I've dove deep enough into my ego to figure out the answer to that question, so I'll leave it blank and let the other cognitive functions drive it. 

Most of the tests I've taken have been the typical four-letter tests that print out your type. 70% of the results I've gotten have been INTP, I think I got ISTP once, ISFP once, and then the rest have been INTJ. 

The other possibility is after reading about how I vs. E isn't ""how much do you like being around people"", but more, ""how do your cognitive functions interact with others"", and the fact that any description of Ne I read is the strongest identification, I could be an ENTP, with depression creating introversion. 

I honestly thank you for this discussion, I love learning about this stuff. I think someone posted a functions test here a bit ago, I'll go check that out right now."

Sales don't mean jack shit. Let's face it, if Cole made complicated tracks he wouldn't be where he is know because he doesn't have Kendrick's charisma to execute it. He's an amazing lyricist but Kendrick is overall better. I have around 10 friends who love Cole and simply ignore Kendrick solely because he's over the top with his lyrical content most of the time, he's just different in that regard, you have to analyze his lyrics carefully to understand them fully and often you can find some hidden gem somewhere in his songs, while with Cole you don't get that, instead it's pretty straight forward meaning.

As for the days, he doesn't have accidents, but I would greatly examine the attention-seeking behavior you suggested re: his new baby sister. 

I know boys have a much harder time with being completely potty-trained and that it isn't uncommon well into your son's age for accidents at night. Now for the part where I'm probably going to get down-voted straight to hell:

Have you ever considered putting him in pull-ups during the day? I know. I KNOW it sounds mean and demoralizing and cruel but I feel like this is all in the approach? He must know your frustration. He must know that soiling his clothes is unacceptable. So if this is an attention-seeking thing or a behavioral thing, maybe this could snap him out of it? No shaming involved. No scolding. Just matter of fact discussion. Mom is unable to keep up with the laundry, its harming your clothes, it's unsanitary and we want to work with you on being a responsible big brother. 

Thoughts? Older siblings already feel marginalized so I know this is a dicey suggestion because it could be read as ""well great now she has even less time for me because the baby is top priority so I go in diapers too so she doesn't have to deal with me."" Just wondering if this will encourage the behavior to stop (if it's behavior) and if it isn't, you can get to the bottom of what it really is?

I'm not calling you a bandwagoner. But at the same time, I think the mindset of the fanbase after last season was particularly alarming. Even though Phoenix hasn't won a championship, we have been relatively spoiled as fans with a franchise that has consistently been successful. We can't even compare our struggles to those of Bobcats, Raptors or T-Wolves fans who have watched their teams lose year after year. 

And because of that, you see a lot of fans willing to give up on the team after one losing season. They can throw away 20 years of great history and memories just because of a 25-57 record. That's what upsets me.

Why is it his friend and not you? Could be due to one of several reasons. He may feel more comfortable with his friend and more able to open up about what's bothering him (especially if it's somehow related to you or your relationship. It may be because he knows his friend shares his interests in TV and games, so he's a natural partner for these activities.

I do think you're overreacting, unless you feel he is not communicating with you at all. That's an issue in and of itself. If you're just upset that you're not #1 on his list of who to vent to when he's down, I don't think there's much to do here. Just let him know that you're always happy to listen or watch TV and play games if he wants to have a quiet evening and vent or get a load off his chest, and leave it at that. He may take you up on the offer sometime, or he may keep using his friend as this outlet.

My fiancée does something similar with her best friend (they watch girly TV/movies and drink wine) and it doesn't bother me. I understand that sometimes you just want that best friend, or that sometimes she wants another woman to talk to.

JIVEprinting,MLPLounge,1391118780.0,"I don't expect everyone to have the sort of awareness of, and experience with, the enterprise environment (also charitable causes, non-profit accounting, and the human heart) that I do.


But one healthy caution might be: if a charity is spending significant amounts of money to make the public think well of them (and they weren't inclined against it before), something might be going on.


I cannot extend such a benefit of the doubt to the recipients of that money and attention, though.  They understand the state of their cause (breast cancer, panda population, whatever) intimately; **and** they know exactly what they're doing with publicity, fund assignment, etc.


Most ploungers who give money to breast cancer wouldn't mind if it went instead to promote pro-choice or gay marriage lobbying, but if this were r/Islam or a private humanitarian foundation that would be drastically different.


More than that, the real objective (say, ""saving lives"" or ""caring for the poor"") is far less expedient than it might be for other causes.  Pancreatic cancer has much more potential to benefit from extra funding or awareness than breast cancer (which has none whatsoever); certain insects are literally millions of times more important than elephants, and could be rescued from certain doom by 1% of the same funding.


My favorite missionary organization has the stated objective not to exist for more than 5-10 years.  Building institutions for their own sake is the opposite of humanitarianism; it's not the kind of difference that can be legislated, but it's a radical betrayal of the public face of many large social causes."

I had to make sacrifices just to be able to take the full 5 classes required to be a day student. Honestly, I have no idea whether this class is actually *supposed* to be on this type of thing or if the teacher is just being stupid. I'm thinking it's probably the latter. I've only been in school for a few weeks though, so I guess there's time for it to develop somewhat...

The design fundamentals class was mostly billed as a fine arts course, yeah. The teacher was one of the few I've found with any talent, but it was still a *really* low level course.

Fluxxed0,spikes,1391119048.0,"* The advantage that Banisher Priest offers over Pacifism is the 2/2 body, and the downside is that he's harder to cast and easier to remove.  This deck has no shortage of strong attacking creatures, so I've never found the 2/2 to be worth the extra cost and risk.  Plus, two of the main creatures that this deck NEEDS to remove are Desecration Demon and Boros Reckoner... who are found in decks with tons of creature removal and no Enchantment removal.  Finally, the WW in his casting cost occasionally becomes an issue, especially when you need to hold up GW for a Selesnya Charm or 1WW for a Spear activation.

* I originally ran 3x Rootborn Defenses and no Ranger's Guile.  Ranger's Guile gives you protection from Azorius Charm, Banisher Priest, Glare of Heresy, Tidebinder Mage, and Detention Sphere, which Rootborn doesn't do.  Guile is a very versatile card, while Rootborn Defenses is narrower but MUCH better against Verdict.  With Voice tokens and 8 psuedo-flash creatures in the deck, I find the versatility of Guile more useful than the Verdict protection you get from Rootborn. 

* I've tested Ajani a little, and he fits into the same card slots that Spear fits into.  I like the Spear better in this list, because it makes Scion amazing, keeps your 3/3s out of Anger (and Bile Blight) range, and gives you some removal options.  And yeah, I don't need the reach as much because of the bird tokens.

EvanYork,TrueChristian,1391119150.0,"Mostly, the belief that some of the people who claim to be Christians are not really Christians.

On a less detached note, for me a ""True Christian"" must adhere to the Nicene Creed and make their best effort to live a life in accordance with the morality of the Christian faith.  Of course, we must make allowances for ignorance.  Some people sincerely believe or act against these principles out of ignorance and deserve mercy, and correction (if appropriate, and it usually isn't).

Now, while the Nicene Creed is a pretty objective standard for orthodoxy, what do we do about the moral code of Christianity?  The Bible isn't a great guide, since people are pretty much endlessly squabbling about which parts apply to which people.  The church fathers and canons of the church are much clearer, but they are also really, really harsh, and I'd be hesitant to say that they are the objective standard to which every Christian must follow.

One thing I am increasingly starting to believe is that ""true Christianity"" is largely believing a historically grounded Christianity.  We have a pretty good idea of what beliefs are recent innovations and what beliefs are passed down from the early church.  I would propose this as a functioning metric for morality, orthodoxy, and church practice.  There are still unclear parts (Is the Pope the head of Christendom?), but there are some parts that are dead clear.

Ultimately, there is only one test for whether someone is truly Christian or not, and may it be long before we face that terrible judgement."

But Game Day/FNM aren't the Pro Tour, and one of the reasons I personally play this deck is because it WRECKS the sort of rogue aggro decks you typically see at FNM.  So those results aren't really prescriptive of high-REL play.

The reason this deck isn't tier 1 is because it's very unidirectional, whereas the best decks attack from multiple angles with a variety of strategies.  While mono-U is presenting cheap fliers, artifact-based card draw, Master of Waves, and an indestructible god that makes their creatures unblockable, good ol' GW aggro is just sending 4/4s straight up the middle.  Our strategy is the one everyone answers by default, and the cards aren't quite robust enough to put up consistent results in long tournaments."

&gt; A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases.

Let's be happy his other favorite genital mutilation practices did not become classic American traditions, too:

&gt; a method of treatment [to prevent masturbation] ... and we have employed it with entire satisfaction. It consists in the application of one or more silver sutures in such a way as to prevent erection. The prepuce, or foreskin, is drawn forward over the glans, and the needle to which the wire is attached is passed through from one side to the other. After drawing the wire through, the ends are twisted together, and cut off close. It is now impossible for an erection to occur, and the slight irritation thus produced acts as a most powerful means of overcoming the disposition to resort to the practice

2)  Fated Intervention has GGG in the casting cost, and this list runs several cards with WW in the cost.  The mana gets trickier than you'd think, even in a two-color deck with 8 dual lands.  There are tons of games where I lose with only one green on the board and Advent in my hand, or one white on the board and a Scion.  

3)  At the end of your opponent's turn, you cast Advent of the Wurm (5 power).  On your turn, you cast Scion of Vitu-Ghazi (4 power).  When he resolves, you get a bird token (1 power), and then you populate.  You choose the Wurm token to populate (5 power).  So now you have 5+5+4+1 power on the board, or 15.

4)  I'd rather have a 4/4 and two 1/1 fliers than two 3/3s.  The bird tokens are surprisingly useful in this meta.  Finally, Scion + Spear of Heliod gives you more power on the board than Scion + Fated Intervention."

SalazarSmithy,WritingPrompts,1391120176.0,"You medicated my loneliness a few summers ago. It wasn't enough to feel your heart beat in melodic sync with mine. I had to invade you like a blood cell and travel through your veins like a Class A. We sat in a crack den disguised as a love nest, injecting each other with each other, getting high off the fumes of lust and the afterglow of release. I craved you and tried to posses you. You shackled my ankles to yours so we had to walk in step with one another. We danced all night under the glowing heat of addicted passion, pausing only to  have you cradle me in the early hours and tell me you'll never leave. You'll always come back for more and I will do the same. Total dependency - your happiness was mine and my sadness yours. Your joy became my joy and my frowns became your frowns. 

Addicts become sober at least once. Be it for a week, a month, a year or 10. The fortunate wean themselves off for good but some will stay as calfs and need to suckle the teat of heaven until they see hell. I am proud to say we were sober for a while; long enough to see the dangerous fire we were fueling in our home. Our dance lost its perfected routine and the shackles became eroded and rusted. We both left a tangy taste in each other's mouths. It was not unpleasant, just different. Different enough to make us stray to find something sweet, and it regrets me to admit I tasted so many sweet things before giving you up. 

I can feel our shackles tightening once again and I'm welcoming the rush you bring me. It's unhealthy but I'm hopelessly in love and lust all in one, a mixed baggie of endorphin and serotonin that I crave between hits. I know you feel the same way because I already feel that familiar prick of a desperate love addict. Each hug and smile is like huffing on a marker pen, stolen kisses between the movies and dinner and the pub are like snorting cocaine in each establishment's toilet cubicles. This is a well trodden path and we walk it once again hand in hand, kicking the dead leaves up as we go.

The tigers, lions and elephants jumping through hoops have been replaced by (admittedly) very attractive, well-groomed guys gyrating their hips. The candy floss with ecstasy and cocaine, and fizzy drinks with cheap lager. 

As for the gay rights movement as a whole, it's complicated. Where I'm from, the gay rights movement is doing something you can compare to dusting, of all the household chores. Only when you dust, you have to do it again and again, so there isn't a thick layer of it that awaits you when you leave for a while. That thick layer is creeping bigotry.

As for further afield, it's more complicated. Soft power over a nation is still domination in one way or another, for better for worse. The Soviets lost the Cold War, they were frightened of the future that awaited them, such as the 1990s oligarchs dividing up state assets amongst themselves after buying up starving people's shares, and recoiled in fear, leading them to having leaders like Putin, and to re-establish ""traditional"" Russian values. 

And in Africa, they are clinging onto everything they've got, such as a life they have grown accustomed to, regardless of how that life came to be, view any more Western power as something to fight against, just as the Kenyans fought against the Mau Mau Uprising, and as the Arab world revolted against its many suzerains. They will seemingly ""fight the good fight"" against homosexuality. ""The West are at it again.""
 
Imposition of law to stop this is only one step of a very slow process, not least when the majority would disagree with laws on the subject. Look at South Africa. It has same-sex marriage - it had it before most of Western Europe - and corrective rape, beatings and killings on the grounds of homosexuality are frequent. The majority still disprove homosexuality. It is cultural, and because it is cultural, it's time for us to stand back, no matter how much we object. To put it another way, these nations are in the teenage years of sovereignty. And teenagers become a law amongst themselves, despite the protests of their parents.

Before I really ramble on, the gay rights movement is necessary. But where I'm sitting, it's no longer necessary here. It must be made necessary by the people who need it the most, and, in a global perspective, the people who need it most do not live in Western Europe, North America or Australia.

1. Skies of Arcadia: Legends: I was really sorry I couldn't reach the end of this game, but when [the general dies at your hands and his assistant takes over](/spoiler) near the end of the game, I just gave up. I didn't feel a need to continue any longer. I don't understand why, but I just simply couldn't continue.

2. Fallout 3: I have a thing about post-apocalyptic worlds. They just scare me. All I can think about is the suffering those people endured for so long, and how horrible it must have been for survivors to struggle throughout. That, and the game could get pretty scary at points.

3. Dragon Quest VI: This game is difficult. I fought the final boss, died, then went grinding for ten levels, found new armor and weapons, and challenged the boss again only to die slightly later.

4. Lock's Quest: I just found the dungeon defense genre to be incredibly repetitive. Also, the character designs were so angular it made me cringe.

5. Rune Factory: Harvest Moon + Dungeon Crawling!?!? Sign me up! That's what I thought until I learned that the two are literally combined together and you have you fight and pick things at the same time. Additionally, fighting was laborious. I knew I could enjoy better games.

6. New Super Mario Bros: I assumed this would be a worthy successor to Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, but I was wrong. The game was rudimentary, and I skipped almost half of the worlds because I wasn't TINY when I beat a boss! How stupid is that? Entire worlds gone because you couldn't handle such a challenging obstacle! I found myself skipping it once the crows started to peck at me in midair.

7. Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon. I love Fire Emblem, but this game felt unbalanced and lacked a lot of the features that were found in the more recent entries of the Fire Emblem series. I stopped after the first few chapters because I couldn't handle it.

8. The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks: Holy crap, when I'm on the 24th level of a dungeon that reminded me of the Ocean Palace, I wanted to cry. I loved everything else about the game, but my GOD I got lost in a dark room, and I couldn't find a light! It was terrible! I quit it then and there. I just got so frustrated I couldn't handle it.

Does both the left and the right push news that better fits their respective agendas? Sure!  Both do in equal measure, but that doesn't make it less news.  It just means you have to read both agenda viewpoints to find the truths in the middle.

Who's doing the filing of the complaints in 2011?  Pro-lifers.  But the Attorney General's office had to investigate the complaints and discovered the violations, fined for them, and drafted the new legislation in response.  News is out there, just have to look at it all, not just what comes from 'your side'.

You're right that the stricter mana cost isn't an issue when you're in a board stall, and that the lifegain would be nice.  The problem I had with her was the number of games she sat dead in my hand because I either didn't have WWGG, or because I wanted to be casting Wurms and Scions to win the game rather than Trostani to stabilize the board.  That led me to the Guildmage, who gives you the populate effect for just one more mana, and can also be laid down on turn 2 as a blocker or in preparation for your turn 4 Advent.

Automatic transmissions rely on hydraulic fluid pressure to function correctly. With incorrect pressure it begins to slip, shift improperly, have harsh engagement, etc. As you've been experiencing. 

It's fine until it warms up because when the transmission is at operating temperature the fluid becomes more viscous. Typically when problems occur like this it's because of a fault in a hydraulic channel in the transmission, or a bad piston seal. A bad piston seal plus viscous fluid means the fluid is allowed to pass back and forth between seals it's not supposed to. Could be any number of things, and you won't know until the transmission is taken apart and thoroughly inspected. It's at this point, the transmission needs to be rebuilt."

Sounds to me like the client doesn't know anyone else or more likely, doesn't want to pay anyone else, which is a resource issue.

It's Magento, php, MySQL, SagePay with community or commercial extensions for API communication. They can easilty find someone else who could fix this. However, it's e-commerce and Magento specifically. What developers charge for Magento now vs. 2 years ago is quite different. The client has probably already run into what prices are like now. The client hopes they can badger OP and get something out of it. The issue falls under an extended support contract situation that does not exist. The client needs to be professional in approaching the developer. Saying no is professional enough to clients who are unable to pay and come off badgering to start. The developer is under no obligation to do anything here.

The fact that the developer is coming here to Reddit for support and is struggling with being firm with them shows that OP hasn't already been firm enought with them and is not confident enough to do this due to a lack of experience with this. I'm not putting the developer down in any way by saying that, as I once struggled with similar situations myself. A 10 minute phone call wouldn't hurt anyone, and would be an opportunity for the developer to explain the extended support issues from a contract perspective, and to be firm more ""in person"" way than what e-mail is capable of.

I'd caution OP to keep it very brief and to the point on the phone and be ready to say thank you, sorry I can't help more and hang up after that if they keep badgering or the conversation escalates. If the client goes to legal threats or badgering, then I recommend OP tell them that since this has gone to a legal conversation, then it needs to be dealt with legally and no further one on one communication is allowed and this will have to be dealt with legally, with legal counsel from here on out and immediately get off the phone saying (OP) can no longer discuss this further without legal counsel. Hopefully this won't be necessary.

What the client really needs is extended support from someone. And they need to pay for that. They are not entitled to it without paying for it. Badgering instead of offering payment is a red flag here. Plain and simple."

DangerAndAdrenaline,AskMen,1391121307.0,"This isn't my fight, but the craziest fight I've seen and far more action than mine.

I was having drinks with my friend outside of a bar called Capones in Ft. Lauderdale after work one friday. Enjoying the cool night air, checking out the girls in short skirts.

All of a sudden two guys come barreling out of the front doors, rocket between our table and the next (empty) one and end up rolling in the street beating the living shit out of each other. 

After a short few seconds, one gets an advantage and is straddling the other dude and just hammering him in the face with closed fists (Trayvon style).

This is all happening within like 7-10 seconds at this point.

My friend Mike and I are just starting to react to this situation going on no more than 6 feet away from us when...


Holy shit! A third guy come rocketing out of the bar with a beer bottle in one hand. He charges to the fight and smashes the shit out the bottle over the guy's head who had the advantage. Then he just runs off and disappears into the throngs of people constituting Ft. Lauderdale nightlife.

Guy who just got his head bottled is bleeding all over the place but still beating the living shit out of the guy on the ground.

Police are arriving about now (10-20 seconds) after fight started.

The first cop pulls his tazer out and inexplicably tazes the guy on the ground first. This completely incapacitates the dude and whatever defending he was doing before, now he's helpless.

The guy on top doesn't mind kicking a man when he's down and he keeps swinging for the fences.

Finally, after the tazed guy takes like 5-6 more serious hits, another cop gets close enough and tazes the other dude. No sign of crazy running bottle-hitting guy.

Everyone gets cuffed and led away. Probably to get some statements and go to the hospital before at least one went to jail.

Meanwhile there's this literal river of blood running from the scene of the fight into the gutters and curb.

Mike &amp; I went back to drinking our drinks and shouted out an occasional warning to a drunk chick about to ruin her shoes by stepping in the bloody mess."

- $17 billion for wasteful Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), “a program that has become notorious for its use as a backdoor earmark program.”  This program has been around since 1974, and is part of the regular appropriations process.  These funds should not have been part of the relief bill.

- $13 billion would go to “mitigation” projects to prepare for future storms.  This is not a ""relief"" thing that has to be passed immediately, it is a project that can be dealt with through the normal process.

- $10.78 billion for public transportation, “most of which is allocated to future construction and improvements, not disaster relief.”  Seems then like most of it should have been funded through regular projects.

DivineIntervention,Drugs,1391121921.0,"Got pulled over after accidentally cutting off a cop and had to eat 4g of weed in the time he walked from his car to mine. I narrowly avoided trouble, as I had a vape in my pocket and he didn't search me. Shit like this has happened to me plenty.

I've abused (and since recovered from) alcohol, various prescription pills and ecstasy. On more than one occasion I've pushed myself past my limits to the point of endangering my own safety in a very serious way.

I spent an entire festival, one night in particular, on a cocktail of about 11 different drugs at once. It ended up well so I guess it wasn't a ""fuck up"" other than putting my brain through some serious shit.

I wasted so much time drunk, high on marijuana, and faced in ecstasy binges that it has affected my personal life in a very serious way.

I started smoking cigarettes.

I eyeballed a breakthrough dose of DMT my first time. Yeah, I irresponsibly said to myself, ""Hmm... that looks like 100mg or so, let's do this!""

I've had to eat ecstasy and acid to avoid arrest at a DUI checkpoint.

I've been sold bunk shit while dealing with molly.

I've been seriously threatened with violence from people in the drug community on several occasions. I sleep with one eye open these days.

I've had to operate motor vehicles while in the midst of serious psychedelic trips from LSD and mushrooms.

I've sold to people who should not be using (in my eyes, as far as mental stability is concerned).

They say meth, not even once. Well I tried it once, and only once. Also, I've indulged in the pleasures of various other substances that I learned were very enjoyable to me, and although I haven't revisited them, it is on the back of my mind from time to time which scares me.

**I'd like to say that although none of this has ended in very serious repercussions in my life, at least for the bulk of it from the past few years, it has shown me the potential drugs have to ruin your life and your values. Learn from the mistakes you make and the mistakes of others. Know your limits. Catch yourself when you're justifying abuse if you have a problem. Be honest with yourself and those important to you. Learn to say NO. Use safely and moderately for your sake and for the sake of those around you.** 

**Drugs can be a beautiful experience that can teach you many great things about yourself and life or they can simply be a really fun time... but they can also be a very ugly demon if you choose to let them take over. Be wise, there's more to life than drugs. I've lost many important people to me through arrests, deaths, ties being cut, or through other social reasons just as I have met many important people to me through the lifestyle.**

**The more people educate themselves and take to heart the severity of the ramifications possible through such a way of living, the better off we will all be. I didn't mean for this to drag on or get way too deep than I think the topic was intended to get, but I got emotional and went there anyways.**"

 To me, a lot of the episodes they've done so far feel like hollow ripoffs of earlier episodes.  How many dramatic confession episodes do we need?  How many ridiculous games does the school need to take seriously?  The show is becoming a pointless repetition of what made it good earlier.

I feel like Community is on it's last legs.  But, we'll always have season 2.

Right.

As someone who studies IFF's and capital flow through tax entities like Jersey, City of London, Ireland, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Monaco, Switzerland and other such secrecy jurisdictions/tax havens as dubbed by organizations like the World Bank, Tax Justice Network, and Global Financial Integrity I would expect these company documents to stay in there respective jurisdictions with any real primary links between Roman/Chelsea FC PLC and any companies that own player economic rights to stay buried.

Whether the club is doing it or not The Guardian paints a pretty clear picture of what appears to be occurring in the form of [this flowchart](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/30/1391108352230/Chelsea-chart-002.jpg).

It's conjecture at this point. 

Documents suggest...

Apparent involvement...

These are not words that can indict Mourinho, Abramovich, or any other senior level club executives of wrongdoing at least outside /r/soccer and pubs where people will undoubtedly discuss how the evil Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich is buying up players economic rights in Portugal through a series of arcane shell companies based in Jersey and Ireland.

For further reading on how links between Burnaby Investments LP (Jersey), and Burnaby Investments Ireland Ltd (Ireland) will probably not be established it's worth consulting the [2013 Financial Secrecy Index](http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2013-results), and related literature on the special narrative reports exploring the history and politics of Jersey, Ireland, and even the UK's offshore sectors."

* The damage is pure.

* At level 1, it does 15 damage each second regardless of the target's health. At level 2, it does 20. And so on.

* The HP drain is based on your current HP. Ally heals are based on their max hp, and enemy damage is based on their max hp.

* The damage scales linearly. This means that the ray increases 16.6% in power each second.

* Damage is based on how long the beam has been firing, not how long it has been damaging an enemy.

* The ""9/18/27/36% Max Health "" part simply means that if it hits the whole duration, it will take away that much of their health. 

* Heal amount is simply the same as damage, it's just that allies receive half.

Contractions weren't like an on and off switch.  It doesn't just stop completely when the contraction ends.  The contraction ends and you recover, and you're tired, and sore, and catching your breath.  You need the time in between to do that, and all knowing that the next one is coming and you've got to be ready for the next one.  Yeah there are times in between where you feel ok, and you recharge for the next one.  But it's not exactly enjoyable, it's still a lot of waiting.  The feel good cocktail is why you are on cloud nine once it's over, and why you probably won't remember how awful it was, but it is still very traumatic for your body.

ballookey,exjw,1391124082.0,"&gt; How can I be right, but so many people that I know, love and deeply respect be wrong.  If my gut feeling is right and this isn’t as true a religion as I have been led to believe, how is it that so many people (many of them very intelligent) can be wrong?

Because, even though they are possibly good, kind, gentle, and thoughtful people, they are discouraged from reading outside material. They are presented with one side of a case, and that's that.

Think of the Creation book. It was the latest and greatest in my day, though I don't know if they still use it. Doesn't matter, similar things are in the existing Creation brochures and tracts. The Creation book quotes Carl Sagan as thinking the fossil record could be consistent with creation.

Well hold on. I had read Carl Sagan. I knew he believed no such thing (and even though I thought he was wrong, I still loved to read and watch him on most science topics). So I double-checked and it turns out, that the Creation book cuts him off mid-sentence. They lop it off right at the point that it's useful to them, and leave the rest on the cutting room floor.

So here we have my dad, mom, family, friends, elders, etc… all totally swell people. My dad is SMART. A college-educated engineer, who got me into Carl Sagan in the first place. And they think Carl Sagan supports creation because it says so in the Creation book.

*They were mislead*. I call it lying personally because in order to get that quote, the person or persons on the Writing Committee *must* have read the whole sentence. At least to the first period, if not the rest of the paragraph. They had to KNOW what they were doing: Using a famous scientist's name to prop up their beliefs.

*That's not right.*

And they do this time and time again throughout the Creation book, to Sagan and pretty much every other reputable scientist they quote in there. And then there's the *dis*reputable scientists they quote — but if you don't research them, you wouldn't know they're quacks. Then there's the quotes from their own material — not quite academically rigorous, quoting one's own works in support of one's argument. Or quoting from the National Enquirer.

This is all real. You can have the most intelligent JW ever, but if they're afraid to read about evolution from non-JW sources, they'd never know.

So sure. Everyone you ever knew or know are the best people ever, utterly guileless.

But the Watchtower Society? LIES.

A lot of the deceptions and eyebrow-raisers are covered at JWFacts.com. But most JW's won't read it, sure they're apostate lies. And yet every fact is presented with quotes, scans from literature where necessary, links to sources. Every proof is rigorously provided.

You can be the most thoughtful person in the world, but if you were only ever taught the story of Harry Potter and are kept so busy you never can read anything else, and if you're warned off outside writings because they might be apostate lies…then you might believe in a place called Hogwarts. Doesn't make you bad, but the person who taught you that? Doesn't necessarily have your best interests at heart."
PlushieChomby,AdviceAnimals,1391124091.0,"The show my friend was going to (back in 2001) was an 18+ show, and he was 22 or 23 at the time. Because he was shorter than average (around 5'1"" or 5'2"") and pretty skinny, he figured he'd get carded but in no way thought they'd steal his ID and nail it to the wall. A social security card tells you jack shit unless you're willing to go take a few minutes to run the numbers, and a birth certificate is a big piece of paper to fold and keep on you at all times when you're going to a show where people four to five years younger than you should be able to get in without problems, so I somehow doubt he ever thought, ""Hey I need to carry some backups in case I run into an idiot who steals my ID."" Sure learned his lesson, I guess. 

Ironically he never had trouble getting into places down the street, places I could get into in my teens without ID, places that never (or rarely, never saw or heard of it happening myself though it's been many years since) got busted for having minors even though we were definitely there. 

I understand caution, but stealing someone's ID seems a lot over the top to me. I know some places tell their cashiers they have to confiscate *obviously* fake IDs when they're being used but is there any law like that (or rule some places) for bouncers? Though his was obviously real to a *trained* eye, I'd understand more if they had some sanctions like that on them and were untrained in how to spot fakes. It would make some kind of sense to err on the side of caution (though refusing to let him have his ID back when he called offering to prove his identity via birth certificate was an inarguably dick move on their part).

wordswench,gradadmissions,1391124201.0,"I didn't actually see it, but I had seen a similar one he wrote for me before (and some of my interviewers told me they had read that stuff in my letters of rec). I worked one-on-one with that advisor as an undergrad as well as another advisor (who actually passed away very suddenly right before I applied). They both knew me really well and I loved working with them.

My favorite story from that lab: I was baking brownies pretty often (stress baking is the best), and I kept bringing desserts to lab because I didn't have enough housemates to eat them all. One time my advisor ran into my cubicle (I'm a computational person). I was like ""WHAT HAPPENED? DID OUR PAPER GET ACCEPTED?"" I saw the look on his face though and he just looked completely crushed and disappointed. ""No brownies today?"" he said, like a kid who'd just had his candy taken away. He then walked away (and ignored me blubbering about how I had a midterm and hadn't had time to bake). 

I baked more brownies the next time I came in and that seemed to fix it all though :) 

I am sure your advisors wrote amazing stuff! I think it is good to develop a really personal relationship with them, but honestly I only did it because we naturally clicked really well. I think my advisor just was like, ""wordswench is totally awesome and badass and flies planes! Why NOT admit her?!""  and it struck them as unusual/interesting, because a ton of people asked me about that.

However, you seem to indicate the data needs to be encrypted while the system is running but not being accessed, thus adding EFS encryption to files/folders that need more than data at rest protection could be an option (again, built into pro/enterprise versions of Windows).  Also, EFS can be automated via powershell (there are examples on scriptcenter, for instance), including backing up keys/certificates used for encryption (assuming the script is run under the account that will be used to do the encrypting / decrypting of the data).

Since you mentioned the solution must be FIPS-compliant, you would need to use MBAM for Bitlocker key storage anyway (Bitlocker + AD escrow is not FIPS-compliant, due to the way the keys are generated and stored there, apparently).  EFS is compliant in it's default use cases."

I live in NY and so it snowed a few days back. Today, when I left for University I noticed that almost all the ice from the snow in our family house garden was gone. No one touched it nor the temperature was high enough to melt it (it was around -8C all week and water melts at 0C). What happened is that the water was in a 3 phase equilibrium and the wind disturbed the gas phase water above the ice block causing the equilibrium to shift towards the gas phase causing more water to evaporate which in turn causes more ice to melt, and eventually all the ice will turn to gas or be sucked into the ground in the form of liquid water."
ajdeemo,DotA2,1391124967.0,"Spirits should almost always be maxed first, because the attack speed slow is massive. Because of how attack speed works, losses are much more effective than gains. For example, you have to gain 100 attack speed to half your attack speed, but if you're down to 50, your attack time is double that of your BAT. Spirits slow by 140 at max level. An enemy with 200 attack speed, for example, will be slowed to a staggering 60. If they have less than 160, it's going all the way down to 20, which makes your attack time 5x that of your BAT. To put this into perspective, most heroes have a 1.7 BAT, which means it will take 8.5 seconds to complete one attack.

Sun ray should always be maxed second since it scales so much better than dive.

&gt;I'd say both are equally hard to land in teamfights as well.

Really? I've never had trouble landing either. You just have to use them in conjunction with your teammate's abilities. Or wait till their carry starts autoattacking, to hit him with spirits. Ray is really good if you wait until the enemy team is over-committed to the fight, since it can turn the tides if aimed well. It's honestly not that hard to hit after some practice. You should have some cc on your team though, since Phoenix doesn't provide any."

If it wasn't for those meddling GOPers who risked opposition and went along with it...

&gt;Which originally was a concept thought up by Republicans

No.  Republicans did not come up with the ACA as any sort of serious proposal.  Back in the Hillarycare days, some folks batted ideas around...but nothing ever came up for a vote.  

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/15/ellen-qualls/aca-gop-health-care-plan-1993/

Quit repeating the canard that the GOP, like, totally came up with the ACA.

&gt;Democrats wanted the public option, which conservative special interest groups made such a fuss about that it ended up not making it in the final bill.

Democrats had COMPLETE control of the government for months.  They could have passed anything they wanted.  Quit blaming conservatives.  The could ***have passed*** Medicare for all.

&gt;...which in actuality was a return to pre-Bush tax cut levels.

But the only group effected by it was the wealthiest.  The middle class tax cut remained.

&gt;Then, when they got it, they claimed it wasn't what they ever wanted. 

The sequester was a proposal by Obama.  Dems failed to negotiate, so the sequester went into effect.

Quit bashing on Ryan.  He's the one that has worked with Murray to come up with a bipartisan agreement.

&gt;Which was necessary because of the recession.

Read the Economix article.  Food stamps exploded because the rules were relaxed.  There was an advertising campaign.  Their use far outpaced other forms of aid.


    Sequester cuts.
    Cuts to food stamps.
    No immigration reform.
    No ENDA passage.
    Cuts to veterans' pensions.
    Very very few tax loopholes closed.
    Expansion in oil drilling on public lands.
    Expansion of offshore oil drilling.

Oh no you don't.  Sequester cuts were the responsibility/fault of both parties and Ryan has negotiated a budget.  Cuts to food stamps has been negotiated by both parties.  ""No immigration reform""...a lack of action is not something Republicans ""got"".  AFAIK both sides are still working on this.  Just because something is on the left's wish list and it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean the GOP got something.  The GOP absolutely isn't responsible for cuts to vets pensions.  Patty Murray (D) was the co-author of that.  You wriggle out of responsibility better than a greased pig at the county fair.  

&gt;NOT because it was what the majority of Americans want.

Sure... a vote only represents the will of Americans when the Democrats win.

&gt;The only reason Republicans hold the House is due to gerrymandering.

You are deluding yourself.

cluberti,sysadmin,1391125491.0,"Understood - unfortunately, I can only give you guidelines, as I don't know what your workload is, whether or not you're going to try using RemoteFX, what version of Windows Server you'll be using, etc.

In general, for office-worker workloads, you're usually looking at using dynamic memory (512MB initial), with 1GB or 2GB the ""usual"" max depending on the versions of applications being used (Office 2013 may require more than Office 2010, for instance, unless RemoteFX is used, in which case this can start to get murky).  Given the workload of a client machine is more random I/O than the typical ""server"" workload that is more sequential, you will need to make sure you provide adequate storage performance.  Tiered storage tends to work best, as well as segmenting persistent vDisks from pooled vDisks, and if possible, segmentation of the parent disks for the pooled VMs as well.  SSDs are great, but you'll still have a vast number of VMs using disks that are tiered below that storage due to the nature of the information worker workload.  15K SAS disks help with random I/O by being quick at seek time (which is where you end up paying the perf piper most often), and if you have enough of them in enough storage volumes to segment your data traffic your users should get similar performance to a local machine.  Note that iSCSI can be used in VDI scenarios, but only if you're using 10GbE at both ends (servers and storage).  This can save money over FC options (if you're going with new hardware for the storage portion of this project, at least) and provide similar performance, especially when used in MPIO mode (multiple network paths from server to storage and back).

There are tools out there to actually help you determine what your workload would be, and the requirements based on hardware.  I personally prefer Login VSI, but there are others.

If you have more specific questions, just let me know.

Also, make sure your images (and servers, of course, but especially your images) used for your VDI VMs are following [configuration best practices](http://blogs.technet.com/b/jeff_stokes/archive/2012/10/15/the-microsoft-premier-field-engineer-pfe-view-on-virtual-desktop-vdi-density.aspx), and have the [recommended patches](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20893.windows-7-vdi-image-hot-fixes.aspx) (above and beyond security) installed."

It started when Alice, about a month after the test, came back and said the grade was incorrect on the online gradebook.  The teacher took the test and inspected everything and then asked me about the situation as the original grade was a 53 and the new grade was a 96.

lorelei_,changemyview,1391125757.0,"Chiming in with my own story here as someone who is also in their late twenties and who has no contact whatsoever with one of their parents - and hasn't done for nearly 5 years now. 

When I moved out of my mother's house to live on my own I made the (socially unacceptable) decision to cut her out of my life for good. This wasn't an easy decision despite the fact that she was essentially a very controlling parent who would probably be classed as emotionally abusive (or not far off it) and therefore I probably had quite a few reasons to cut off contact with her. Ultimately, however, my decision to cut her out of my life came down to one thing: her need to control me &amp; my life vs my mental health &amp; being able to build a life for myself based on who I was rather than who she wanted me to be. I chose the latter, and it was an entirely selfish choice, but I don't regret it because quite frankly the last (almost) 5 years of my life have been the *best*. I am (and have been) the happiest and healthiest (mentally) that I've ever been. Are there people out there who judge me for making that choice? Almost certainly. Is it something that generates a reaction in people when they find out about? Definitely. Do I care? No, not really. I *know* that it was the right decision for me to make - even if it wasn't the socially acceptable one and even if it does mean that things get a little complicated when the topic of parents comes up in conversation. 

Now I'm not going to sit here and tell you that you *should* cut your parents out of your life (for the record, my father is still a part of my life although we have infrequent contact due to both being busy) - that's not a decision I can make for you. What I will say is this - think about your other options before you do it. Is it possible that you could improve your relationship with your parents by talking to them about why you struggle with the relationship as it is? For me, this wasn't an option as my mother refuses to accept that she is ever in the wrong (about anything, ever) and I knew that when I made my decision. It might be an option for you though, and it's one worth exploring if it is. What I'll also say, is make sure you're aware of what this decision really means. It may seem like a simple choice, but by cutting off contact with them you will be cutting out a part of your support network for when times get tough. This may not seem like an issue right now if things are going well in your life, but it gets hard real quick during the tough times (and I say that as someone who's faced both a moderately serious health scare &amp; redundancy with minimal support).  

TL;DR Fuck social acceptability - the choice is yours to make if you want to make it, but be aware of what that really means and what you will lose if you make it. "

Thankfully my dad said the thought made him uncomfortable and politely declined on my behalf, because I couldn't imagine busting places I already knew I could get into, where people had been kind to me, where my parents had no idea I'd been and which could've further complicated my life in ways I didn't want.

keypuncher,Conservatives_R_Us,1391126065.0,"&gt;  Red-baiting, socialist-this, socialist that. Just doesn't resonate, especially with people young enough to not even remember the Cold War. Socialism to young people is something that happens in Britain -- it does not call to mind bread lines in the USSR. Yet the Republican Party still uses this stale rhetoric and labors under the impression it works.

I agree, though that is a failure of our liberal-controlled education system.  One that is correctable, but you are correct that it doesn't work as well as it should.  It is useful to note that the vast majority of those who actually *lived* under those systems - Soviet Russia or Castro's Cuba, for example - want *nothing* to do with the Democratic Party in the US.  They recognize the similarities and know only too well where those policies lead.

&gt; Social conservatism -- meaning, specifically, ""I am religious and I am going to use the government to ensure others are forced to live lifestyles I approve of"" -- nonstarter.

Agreed in part, though that isn't what social conservatism means.

&gt; The middle class family values thing. Too many homes are broken or non-traditional, and too many people are unemployed, food insecure, or suffering from crippling debt. This happy horse shit may well appeal to people fortunate enough to have weathered the recession, but it is totally foreign to most other people. Yet the conservatives keep harping on it.

Here I think you are wrong.  While many people did not grow up with a two parent family, you would be hard pressed to argue that most people do not *wish* they'd had one, with two well-adjusted, loving parents.

The lack of such families is a large part of what is wrong in the US, and the GOP pushing for them is not a bad thing."

* The damage is pure.

* At level 1, it does 15 damage each second regardless of the target's health. At level 2, it does 20. And so on.

* The HP drain is based on your current HP. Ally heals are based on their max hp, and enemy damage is based on their max hp.

* The damage scales linearly. This means that the ray increases 16.6% in power each second.

* Damage is based on how long the beam has been firing, not how long it has been damaging an enemy.

* The ""9/18/27/36% Max Health "" part simply means that if it hits the whole duration, it will take away that much of their health. 

* Heal amount is simply the same as damage, it's just that allies receive half.

mhweaver,technology,1391126634.0,"&gt;So your company didn't follow any form of compliance standards?

Quite the contrary. We had strictly enforced quality assurance standards, but it wouldn't have been feasible to have QA people listen to every single call. QA was pretty much the only reason anyone ever needed to listen to recorded calls, and there's no way they could QA every single call, so they didn't bother recording all of them. If you can tell if someone's a shitty agent from 5 calls, you don't really need the other 45 to confirm it. 

We also had supervisors, team leads, etc listen to live calls on a regular basis to make sure we had more than just QA reports to go by.

&gt;I mean, I could see certain TYPES of calls not needing to be recorded, but a specific percentage of calls being excluded outright from recording is sketchy at best. 

It wasn't just a flat 10% of calls. Other things factored into whether a call was recorded, too. For example, if someone only rarely took calls, almost all of their calls were recorded and QA'd.

&gt;What type of call center was this?

A big one, supporting the largest internal network in the US (it was a contract for a very demanding client with very deep pockets)."

The point of rules is to regulate in cases where one team might be getting an unfair advantage: travelling makes it much, much easier to drive to the hoop, fouling gives the fouler space on offense or extra power on defense, etc. If the violation does not produce any advantage, then I say don't worry about it. Unless it's really, really blatant. It's just like the advantage rule in soccer: a defender fouls a player but if the foul produces no unfair advantage for the defender than the referee ignores it and lets play go on.

The same gene, sonic hedgehog, regulates both eyes and mouth width, but in opposite directions: shh downregulates eyes and upregulates mouth width. The authors suggest that in low light caves, it would be more advantageous to have a larger mouth gape than eyes, and the way you make a larger mouth is by increasing shh expression, which has the effect of reducing eyes, even though eye loss wasn't the trait under selection.

This year I have a relatively newer teacher who really doesn't know how to teach. She knows Math really, really well, but she doesn't know how to teach it at all. She's a nice teacher and all but her problem is that she tries to teach math with math and it's really hard to get a grasp on things when everything is explained with math terminology instead of every day words and descriptions."

kittenpantzen,funny,1391127437.0,"The southeast. It is a very different environment than pretty much anywhere west of the Rockies. My area is more progressive than most, so there are pockets where it is less of a big deal, but by and large, if you're looking to work something white collar (regardless of where on the food chain that puts you), visible tattoos are still very much taboo. 

There are exceptions for jobs in the creative fields (programming [depending on the company], advertising, sound engineers, etc), of course, but you find that everywhere. But, in general, the South still has professional standards of appearance that are fairly conservative. The dress code where I work, for reference, is even specific enough to cover the acceptable heel heights of women's shoes, and we work desk jobs all, so it's not like it is a safety hazard. It does not specify hair or makeup colors, preferring a more general prohibition on ""dress or adornment that is intended to make a statement or draw attention to oneself,"" which makes for a lot of leeway in what they can write you up over. 

Sure, I miss my days of blue and purple-streaked hair, and I would love to be able to wear my Litas to work, but I don't enjoy those things more than I enjoy my job (or the paycheck that comes with it). 

Adding to your geographic context, if you work within IT, there is that context as well. I did web application development for a while when I was younger and even in the South, my peacock hair was no biggie. Only when I was consulting with more conservative clients did I have to redye it a more natural color and wear business dress."

To be blunt you are over reacting, when we need time to be alone or with friends to cool down it doesn't mean anything. We need to sort out our feelings, its not that you are bad at comforting its just you are most likely more used to talking about your feelings and being out in the open and as aforementioned we are not familiar with that. It is nothing against you and more importantly it is not about you, it's about him coping and recharging.

Starwhisperer,AskReddit,1391127647.0,"Remember in Reddit, anecdotes are factual evidence... I never once heard my black friends ""complain"" about slavery. And to even use the word complain to describe an emotion towards a truly dehumanizing institution is a travesty in itself.  
  
What could I possibly ""complain"" about when it comes to slavery? The word complain sort of implies that your emotion of discontent is unjustifiable, is ridiculous, is irrelevant, is annoying. In my opinion, if black people do have some sort of emotion towards slavery it's never of the complaining category because, yes black people are not dumb and understand that this has happened to their ancestors. What black people feel when the topic of slavery does come up which is much rarer than what Reddit likes to believe is of the lamenting category.  
  
 It's like someone feeling pain and a deep emotional connection to an uncle they either met or have not met because he has some sort of sickness or injustice done to him that ruined or limited his life's potential. It's like someone feeling sadness for a stranger because they happened to have been murdered because they like the same activity you did (piano playing) or they had red hair like you. Acknowledgment of that common element beyond humanity that connects you to that individual and the insanity behind the act that punished him for it makes someone feel heart-break. My ancestors, who in my knowledge were not slaves, does not prevent me from feeling a deep sense of wrong when discussing slavery and how just some century ago it could have been me. My ancestors who were not Jews does not prevent me from feeling a deep sense of injustice for when they were persecuted in their own countries.  
  
It's the same feeling and the feeling is inevitably a bit stronger when you and that group have certain elements that connect you with each other besides just being human. I don't think that people get this. It's a word called empathy. I 100% believe that people who say black people complain about slavery are either consciously or subconsciously 100% racist. When they go on to say that it's their excuse for not ""getting ahead"" and compare black people's socioeconomic status with other groups, I consider that 100% racist. It's like people refuse to acknowledge because it's more convenient and simple for them not to, that racism or systems of inequality do exist in America and may affect certain groups more so than others in specific areas. I'm not even limiting it to the racial kind; I'm including gender, sexuality, ethnicity, class group, anything. This is not a opinion, it's a fact.  
  
And when people fight to replace systems of inequality for those of equality or choose to point them out and not to ignore them, they are dubbed to be ""complaining"" about slavery or some elusive racism that does not exist. I just can't with Reddit, and would not want to meet the stereotypical Redditor in real life who believes controversial opinions are a pass to voice misinformed and bigoted comments and express immoral biases so they can be upvoted to mass agreement in the name of none other but social acceptance in the interwebs.  
  
Again, I went on a tangent, and it has nothing to do with your post, but I just had to respond to it. I would never say I'm a Redditor because these sort of ""uncontroversial"" but highly amoral comments make it to the top. Of course, if I say something that's simply immoral then by default it will be controversial, but what the point? Just become someone might think the same depraved way as I do does not make the viewpoint any better or any worse. "

FTA:

""The aid will help states rebuild public infrastructure like roads and tunnels and help thousands of people displaced from their homes. Sandy was the most costly natural disaster since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and one of the worst storms ever in the Northeast.

More than $2 billion in federal funds has been spent on relief efforts so far for 11 states and the District of Columbia. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund still has about $4.8 billion, and officials have said that is enough to pay for recovery efforts into early spring.""


The Democrats wanted the full bill (including that money for Alaskan fisheries) passed right away.

Don't try to make it out like the GOP wanted folks dying in the streets when what they were doing is saying, ""Hey...let's pass immediate emergency aid and then take another look at the other things in this giant spending bill."""

I have a couple different theories on Aria's motive, the main one being that she found out Ali was blackmailing her dad and wanted to stop her. It's also possible that they were working independently trying to find out where Ali was and when Aria found out that Ezra was also looking for her, they joined forces. I don't think A really cares about torturing the girls just for the sake of torturing them. The A team's main goal is finding Ali, which is why Ezra cozied up to Aria, hoping to glean information about Ali's whereabouts.

At this point, Emily seems to be the only one that Ali trusts. I don't think Ali really knows who she can trust and who she can't. I do think that Jason and Mrs D. have known that she wasn't dead for quite a while, if not the whole time."

If given the choice, would you rather just have people just be upfront in other non-height related issues (e.g. Posts of ""I'd just wish all fat men would die."") or have it so that height isn't acceptable to talk about, but people still have height biases?

In one month, I will have been cigarette free for 3 years. I have never smoked another cigarette since I quit. I'm so happy I quit. 
Make sure you get a quality product, and don't skimp on the nicotine. Then make a commitment to yourself to quit. No fear, you have a pacifier right there if you need it. Also, remember that most people have to try many times before they quit. So, don't feel bad about the times that you haven't made it. Those were all necessary practice for your big success.

I think you can get rid of the capital lettering in some of the words you have, it isn't very necessary. Whenever I apply to a job, I tweak the title/position to fit what they are looking for. I do props, so if they are looking for a property master I write that. If they are looking for a prop carpenter, I would write that instead. 

As for your actual resume, you may want to find a different layout or form. The one you have it a little difficult to read and the layout doesn't quite line up. It would also be nicer to separate the sections in a clearer way, such as putting the titles in bold and/or all caps. Another way you could organize your jobs is by where you worked, rather than what job you had. But thats up to you.

daisyismydog,Indiemakeupandmore,1391130850.0,"If you're looking for basics/personal HGs for yourself I'd recommend getting a lot of trial/sample sizes and putting aside some money to purchase full sizes of the things you like if any of them pan out for you. Here are some things I consider basics and some companies that I've bought from (although you may not and that's totally fine too):  

* **Moisturizer:** I'm not using a full-on indie moisturizer right now but I do mix in or top off my regular moisturizer with some rose hip seed oil. I have dehydrated skin and moisturizer goes a long way in making my skin feel like actual human skin (vs. lizard skin). I got mine off a seller on etsy but Garden of Wisdom is also known for selling raw skincare ingredients and they have oil sample sets where you can get 3 samples for ~$10. Depending on which oils you buy it might be cheaper to just go ahead and get the full size and use it for something else if it doesn't pan out as a moisturizer. Other options that I don't have as much experience with: Silk Naturals (face moisturizers, serums, skincare in general and also makeup), Haus of Gloi (I hear a lot about the pumpkin butters)   
* **Makeup remover:** I really like removing my makeup with oil. I find the experience enjoyable (like giving my face a massage) and somewhat look forward to doing it every day. I generally use whatever I have on hand although I do like mineral oil as well as a mix of apricot kernel + grapeseed oil. I've ordered my oils from TKB Trading but there's also Garden of Wisdom and some companies carry a pre-made mix (e.g. Silk Naturals). There's a post on the sidebar of /r/skincareaddiction on the oil cleansing method and feel free to ask me any questions if you're interested.  
* **Foundation:** Meow Cosmetics carries loose powder foundation, has an extensive shade range, free color-matching help, and $1 samples available. Their shipping for samples is also $5 for domestic orders and they have a minimum order of $10. If you're looking for cheap this may turn you off but I do think the product is worth it and I somewhat doubt they're ripping us off and rolling in millions. I favor the purrfect puss (lightest coverage) formula because I find it really sinks into my skin but I think the pampered puss (medium coverage) one is nice too but I can sort of feel it on my skin. Their flawless puss (heavy coverage) formula is hands-down the heaviest coverage foundation I've ever used/tried and since I'm not big on heavy coverage I'm not its biggest fan but it definitely impressed me. If you're looking for heavy coverage I would say this is a good place to start, and if you have sensitive skin the pampered puss version also has a good amount of zinc oxide that is supposed to have anti-inflammatory benefits which is nice. Other options include: Performance Colors for cream-to-powder (side note: I've not tried their foundation but I'm happy with the concealer samples I have now), DreamWorld Hermetica for powder, and Silk Naturals for a cream stick and powder.
* **Eye primer:** I do recommend using an eye primer underneath basically any shadow (indie or not). The only indie option I've tried so far is from Performance Colors and I'm fairly happy about it. I find the sweet vanilla scent a little cloying (although I just don't like scents in general so that's not unusual for me). I have rather dry eyelids though so I'm probably not the best test for eyeshadow primer but I also hear good things about de Leon's and Darling Girl's.  
* **Adhesive base:** I'm a big fan of duochromes, complex colors, and just in general colors not fading and me being able to touch my eyes. I think Fyrinnae's pixie epoxy is good for catching onto a lot of shimmer and letting me touch my eyes every once in a while without the insta-raccoon effect. I did [this](http://imgur.com/a/3xLYf) experiment here which helps show why I like it so much. I haven't tried Darling Girl's Glitter Glue but it's supposed to be a bit better than the PE as it works with mattes and is reportedly easier to blend with. I haven't heard of anyone who's tried both prefering Fyrinnae's PE over DG's GG so you might check out the latter unless you're already making an order from Fyrinnae in which case PE is available in a trial size ($2 IIRC) and DG's GG isn't.  
* **Eyeshadow:** I personally consider Fyrinnae's Serendipity to be one of my must-haves because I can wake up, put it on my lid (without primer mind you) and feel like a fairy princess. It does fade quite a bit without primer and I can touch my eyes every once in a while if I add pixie epoxy into the mix but if I just need to get out for an hour or two then this is my go-to. It's also quite complex and looks like I spent some time blending/doing things instead of swiping (you don't even have to pat this one on) a quick bit of powder across my lids. The second to last picture in this [album](http://imgur.com/a/xMZx1) from /u/pandasoul is precisely how Serendipity looks in real life. 

I'm not big on scented products so I'll have to skip recommending soaps and body butters as most of them are scented. I have been meaning to try out some of Haus of Gloi's things, namely the exfoliating scrub and pumpkin butter in aether (unscented) though as I've heard they're popular. I believe they also sometimes stock a soap sampler where you can try some of the ends (of the soap blocks when they're cut) of various scented handmade soaps though. 

I'm also basically the biggest sucker for samples included with a purchase and I believe most of the companies I've mentioned give a free sample with your purchase (I think Performance Colors might have a $10 order minimum to qualify for samples) and/or run gift with purchase specials. Feel free to ask any questions. "

Turkstache,flying,1391131912.0,"It's a minority, but I've flown with a ton of people of all backgrounds. For some of them, even simple flying was the most stressful thing they'd ever done.

I never figured out why before I moved on to my next job, but some situations would possess students to use large, abrupt inputs. I think it's their shock at seeing the plane's nose whip one way or another that makes them freeze in place.

Even as I demonstrated a simple transition from cruise to descent some students would, on their first or second flights, grab the yoke and snap it into their chests...Terrified at seeing so much ground in front of them.

Other students of mine would start tensing up as they practiced landings, and they would start pushing out their limbs in all directions, eventually pressing into me.

A student of a fellow instructor would start screaming uncontrollably and freeze any time the plane hit about 400 feet when on final for a runway. He could fly without issue otherwise, but we had to tell him flying wasn't for him.

Instruction was a crazy time and I saw behavior I never expected of anybody. It's quite an effort to get someone comfortable and proficient with flying, who never drives, plays video games, does sports (or physical activity in general), or have any hobbies whatsoever. So many people just aren't used to seeing the world go around them from any other perspective than 4 to 6 feet off the ground at a leisurely pace, nor used to using anything more complicated than a go-kart at an amusement park."

But even with anti-discriminatory laws, wedding businesses should be allowed to discriminate. If their religion disapproves of an action of others, they shouldn't be forced to business that expressly approves the action they aren't suppose to approve of.

The more egregious failures of justice is people with money getting off for crimes they are legitimately guilty of, which I would assume happens in most countries, and sentencing is often way out of whack due to things like mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent crimes.

Nope. I recognize a look that is feminine when I see it but there are so many different ways to be and look feminine that you can't pin it down to one distinct look.

&gt;What are your thoughts on femininity in general versus femininity in fashion?

They tend to go hand in hand, I think. Women who are very traditionally feminine tend to dress in a manner that is very feminine too. Beyond that, good grooming makes a huge difference: get your brows shaped and then maintain them with tweezers; take good care of your skin, especially your face; wear lip balm every day to keep your lips soft and smooth; keep your fingernails and toenails shaped and clean, and your cuticles soft and moisturized rather than ragged; get your hair trimmed regularly so it looks healthy; take five minutes in the morning to dab on a bit of perfume and toss on some cool accessories. If you are well-groomed then you will look more feminine and polished, regardless of your personal style.

&gt;And to answer that original question: How does someone dress more ""feminine""?

Drabby,worldnews,1391133625.0,"Young American woman in Italy comes home one night after a date with her Italian boyfriend to discover there was an intruder in the house she shared with one English woman and two Italian women. She calls her boyfriend and the police, and it is discovered that the English roommate was brutally murdered (and raped?). The police suspect Amanda and her boyfriend of the crime. Amanda's very American mannerisms and response to tragedy, as well as public displays of affection with her boyfriend, turn the tide of Italian public opinion against her. Amanda is harshly interrogated by the police and (by her account) forced to sign a confession implicating herself and a third party who has an airtight alibi. 

All forensic evidence at the scene conclusively implicates a young Italian man named Guede who has had previous run-ins with the law. The police strike a deal with him, and he claims that Amanda and her boyfriend were his accomplices even though there's no evidence they had ever met previously. Guede has left bloody fingerprints and shoeprints all over the bedroom, but nobody else's prints or DNA are present. Nevertheless the police believe the murder was committed by at least 2 people.

At the trial, the prosecution claimed that the victim's death was due to a Satanic sex ritual masterminded by Amanda and carried out by her boyfriend and Guede. She was convicted. After four years in prison, she and her boyfriend were acquitted on appeal and freed. Amanda is back in Oregon now, and a third verdict came back guilty for the two of them. It's unlikely that she'll be extradited, but she can pretty much never leave the US. Her boyfriend is probably screwed."

hylandw,DnD,1391133725.0,"The Elven Vile Implement Legion (or EVIL)

This is an alliance of all the separate and individual groups of elves in the land. They band together to control all that they think is evil. They collect artefacts from every race and creed, except elves, of course.

They are led by a Revenant elf, a man who claims to have seen the Shadowfell and returned, and who claims to have been sent by the Raven Queen to rid the land of the tools and implements of pain and misery. He claims that torture, pain and misery are affronts to the Raven Queen, as she brings death to ease pain, and those that would keep pain alive are restricting her right as a god.

They lead forces to destroy tyrants and evil leaders and take from them their magical tools and artefacts. This is the only time they are allowed to kill - the Raven Queen does not abide useless death. This is why it will not kill the players.

The group is beloved by many, and many governments consider it a heinous crime to try and stop their work (since it's a sign of evil), and all civilized governments will band together to capture and prosecute these ""criminals"". This means it's a really bad idea for the players to try and outright destroy this organization.

The problem with the Elven Vile Implement League is that they don't just take evil artefacts - they take all of them. For ""analysis"". They give false reasons, citing vague, outdated texts that speak of an item resembling it, or even outright forging prophecies. These objects seem to eventually find themselves possessed by new owners, almost always rich elves. The group is good, sure, but they're effectively stealing the world's precious artefacts and giving them to elvenkind."

briannasaurusrex92,misophonia,1391133865.0,"At 6 they can definitely be trained to use manners, chew with mouth closed, don't talk with food in their mouth, drink from a regular cup so the sucking noises aren't so bad, if any of these are still problems. (Not trying to imply that you just haven't taught your kids manners... I'm sure you have, just suggesting that it might be possible to go farther.) Just frequent reminders to please chew with your mouth closed! I can't understand you if you talk with your mouth full! Will go pretty far for everyday life.

Both children are old enough to start using or asking for a tissue when their noses need blown, instead of sniffing.

I would also cautiously ask about needing constant supervision. Are they truly abnormal in that respect? I know a lot of six year olds who can be left completely alone to eat, and some well-behaved four year olds who are the same. I frequently leave kids as young as two or three in the dining room so I can ""wash up"" in the kitchen, except if they aren't able to self-feed but by that age they should be. I listen for trouble the whole time time, but even just having that psychological divide makes it easier. 

I also got the impression you would like to do family dinners or other meals, where everyone sits down together and eats together. This I still struggle with myself, but it seems to be a consensus here on the sub that having music or tv on in the background can help, just so that during those moments of silence you have something else to concentrate on. 

I also want to say that being affected by your condition doesn't make you a bad mother at all :) you love your kids and acknowledge that they're only normal, they're not at fault. You want to spend time with them, and are working to find ways to do so that work for you and your family. You're a GREAT mom!"

duggtodeath,offbeat,1391134610.0,"&gt; The only mention of unnamed shadowy conspiracy groups eroding our rights have come entirely from you and you alone.

Yes, you cannot pinpoint the people supposedly taking away out rights. When invisible forces to conspire to do harm, we call that a conspiracy theory.

&gt; Legislative overreach. Activists judges. Abuse of executive orders.

These again are claims, not evidence. You have built a narrative already and are looking for scant evidence to support that idea. That is being dishonest to yourself because we dismiss the misses and only count the hits and then pat ourselves on the back. You are telling a story which are not supported by facts to show a concerted effort to take away anything from Americans. Even you cannot show me how you've lost anything. You have everything and are in no danger of losing anything. I do not understand your mentality.

&gt; These are not vague shadowy conspiracy concepts. They are real threats to the constitution of our nation. If you don't understand the inherent dangers of an unchecked bloated state, then you really are beyond help.

This is again dismissing your responsibility to provide proof and bowing out the debate by attacking me is not support of your core argument. Like I said before, I am remaining open-minded, and in order to be convinced, I need evidence to support your claim. Evidence is not ""look around you,"" nor is it ""its self-evident."" You are taking unrelated incidents and legislation to build a story that does not exist.

It also shows me you have a poor understanding of how our government actually works. Everyone isn't evil. We do have bastards, idiots and charlatans, but we also have people working to keep it running because they believe in it. Its not perfect, but it is better than many alternatives society has tried. We can make govt better by participating, not sitting on the sidelines clutching our guns, shaking our fingers and huffing. If you love this country as you demonstrated, you'd be part of the solution, not on the outskirts looking in and acting like all power is lost. Call your reps. Write letters. But if you accuse someone of ill towards Americans, have the decency to bring up solid evidence. Don't let the tail wag the dog.

&gt; Just remember: I am not your enemy. No matter how badly you may desire it, I will never be your enemy.

What the fuck are you on about? Again, why do you have this war-like mentality that my disagreeing with you is some kinda violence? We are having a civil discussion. You seriously need to stop hanging out with people that perpetuate fear in order to get you to listen. Anyone who uses fear to get your ear is only looking out for themselves. They want something. And whatever it is, they won't share once they have the prize.

&gt; And so I will continue fighting for the rights of all of us, self defense rights and law included.

Good, then start by researching the things you feel are wrong. Do not come up with the conclusion first because it is intellectually dishonest. Let the evidence inform your decision, not the other way around.

&gt; And you are free to hate me or ridicule me for that.

The persecution complex isn't cute. Stop hanging around people that are convinced the world is trying to take everything from you. Those people are crazy.

&gt; You are a fellow citizen and no enemy of mine.

Dude, calm down. Seriously, human beings don't talk to each other like this. The world is not black and white man. Just relax. There are bastards out there, but not every shadow is a boogeyman.

&gt; Misguided, certainly, but I do not blame you. You are not my enemy.

Again, what the hell does this mean? Since when was I in combat with you? And how exactly am I misguided? I provided researched and cited evidence for my claims that SYG laws are unfairly used to hurt minorities and even whites who didn't get a chance to tell their side of the story. You had the opportunity (several hours) to provide counter-evidence to refute my claim. You scrapped together some irrelevant incidents and I countered those based on my research of them. Easily I found out that they are unrelated and none of them have the impact if taking rights from people. It just seems like someone who is uneducated gave you those links. Stop listening to those people.

Again, thanks for taking the time to respond. It's been a long day. Cheers, man!"
xtphr,OkCupid,1391134621.0,"I think a lot of people who would put ""Speaks C++ fluently"" would get turned off if a traditionally attractive girl geeked out about her interest in fashion and makeup in a very specific way.

You don't want to hide or lie about what you are or what you do. Say you're a programmer or that you're handy with computers.

We never put anything on our website regarding children, just used word-of-mouth to let people know.

As far as the grandmother is concerned... It's up to you and your husband. It's your day and you have to do what is right for you. If you are concerned about having her at the wedding, don't invite her. If you think she is getting help and is a bit healthier closer to the wedding, make it a point to visit her right before and include her in on things, like maybe showing he some pics of you trying on your dress and tell her about how you'll wear your hair and the tux he'll wear.

This rabidness crosses throughout the different ""sects"" within Judaism, and there are plenty of people who could be considered agnostic or atheistic Jews who hate the Palestinians as much, if not more then the ultra-orthodox and all the rest who do actually believe that the West Bank is theirs to take through ""divine right""-- others might just say that the Palestinians are ""Arab filth"" or ""terrorists"" or ""there are no Palestinians"" or something that goes into the aggressive Israeli ""nationalist"" line, which isn't particularly connected to any really strict orthodox Judaism.

The sort of people who lyingly claim that the Palestinians ""are Al Qaeda"" or ""have Wahhabi beards and wear burqas"" (although they don't actually specify Wahhabi beards, they just say that Palestinians are them without using the term) because they want to sell this false narrative of the Palestinians in Palestine as being hideous, barbaric Qaeda-aligned fanatics who're ""fighting to exterminate the Jewish people"", or something along those lines.

You're not weaning yourself off nicotine, so all cigarettes do is pump your body full of all that tar again. Don't beat yourself up about it, know that having a cigarette isn't going to set you back. It's just going to hurt your lungs a bit.

Allow yourself the cigarettes in stressful situations, if that's what you need. Afterwards you can look at your e-cig setup and see if you can improve it. Could you have a stronger nicotine liquid on standby for those situations? Maybe get yourself some el toro strong tobacco liquids http://www.houseofliquid.com/category-s/1830.htm

The key is to not beat yourself up. Free yourself from the shame, just view it as a journey.

The only drawback from E-Cig smoking is that it doesn't feel like it damages you. For a lot of smokers, it is a wilfully self-destructive act, and ecigs will never replicate that.

ruat_caelum,writing,1391135525.0,"Magic like anything else can take two routes. Think of watching E.R. or any other technical show. Does the medical jargon sound good to you? probably. Does it sound correct to a doctor? Nope. That Electrical engineer that just figured out how to shut down the city's grid by reading a blue print in the office and tossing a few switches and tossing a metal garbage can onto some wires... seems legit I mean he's smart right? Any engineer will laugh at the blueprint stage, who even has up-to-date prints on a job site let alone a complete understanding of a system or its weaknesses... etc etc

So magic from a story perspective can be told to the reader in a way where he doesn't understand HOW it works but can see the results, think hobbit style. These tend to be stories that are not magic-centric, i.e. magic exists yes but the main plot etc is not a magical based.

Or explain the magic to the reader so they know how it works, even if the people in the story don't. i.e. Wheel of time. Elements twist and tie and bind and create a spell. etc etc

The problem is that once you explain the magic the reader has to ask themselves... If you can heal someone's wounds, where are the for profit healers that travel from city to city? OR they can create permenate light spells? and magic has been around for 3 thousand years... where are all the permanite lights?

Magic is akin to tech. There is a famous saying that ""any advanced enough technology would be indistinguishable from magic."" Well magic is like tech. It becomes silly when there is no balance.

We don't have technology that can get us from new york to la in a day without a significant cost (fuel, etc) and infrastructure (manufacturing planes, training of pilots, repairs, airports, services that keep all those running etc.)

Silly to me is the balance. If a warrior can kill 5 guys at once while only breaking a sweat perhaps a mage with as much training and skill can do the same. But can a man lift a horse? nope. Can a mage? maybe... but at what cost? a warrior could by building a rig and pully system.. is that what the mage does?

Think of it as balance and it should all work out. Be careful though there are game-breakers. Love potions, mind control, magic only being by certain blood lines (people would breed magic users in the past to get better armies etc, everyone would be able to do magic.) look at how history would use the mages and their magic."

Even IF I did use gay to mean lame, which I didn't, I don't think its actually that black and white; I understand how you could feel that way but I disagree.  I think you need to have better understanding of the English language, particularly how rapidly words are evolve and how words can be used with multiple meanings in different context.  Personally,  I don't use words like gay or fag to mean lame but that said I don't think that makes someone who does by default is a homophobe.  I think it really kinda takes away from what true homophobia is and how much people have suffered from it when you pretend that when a 12 year old says its ""hate speech"" when, clearly, that isn't how its meant.

cptn_garlock,anime,1391136390.0,"&gt;I've only been here since the summer season and it seems there's only one good moe show per season which seems quite reasonable.

There's definitely more than just one a season. You're picking out the ones that did (or will likely do, in the case of *Engaged*) really well. Furthermore, there's the pervasiveness of moe style and art elements in lots of different shows, even ones you wouldn't classify as moe and don't really need them.

&gt;Can someone explain moe hate to me?

Moe-hate seems to be much more of a Western phenomenon. This is based simply on observation, not quantitative study, but a much smaller percentage of American ""otaku"" seem to appreciate straight moe in comparison to Japanese ones (this is reflected in the kinds of shows that get selected for Western dubbing; I'd say it's much more likely for a show like *Shin Sekai Yori* to get a Funimation release as compared to *Non Non Biyori*, despite the former barely selling 300 average while the latter almost broke 10k) However, anime is obviously catered towards Japanese otaku tastes, so shows with moe tend to get produced. 

&gt;So what are the shitty moe shows and if they're shitty, why do they end up getting enough attention for people to complain about them?

I don't think people complain about how shitty those shows are, I think more people who complain, complain about the entire genre itself. It's not because people are paying attention to either the stellar or mediocre moe shows, they just pay attention (and hate on) moe shows in general."

My own Granny was a wartime nurse who managed, enabled, and took care of my alcoholic Grandpa for their whole lives together, and I swear, reading that sentence was such a ""whoa"" moment. I didn't even know it was a cliche!

It may be possible that your natural caregiving -- a positive trait, what led you to your profession -- may actually be causing you to tolerate a level of management that is unreasonable to expect between a partnership of equals.

Consider the following: Radiator has leak.

Engine then is destroyed or needs major work. This can all happen 5 minutes from your house, much less 120 miles round trip.

Neebat,news,1391137052.0,"&gt; higher speed limits mean less deaths

I think you've completely misunderstood what that means.  It does NOT mean you should feel safe breaking the speed limit.  It's a message to the people who MAKE the speed limits, not the ones who BREAK the speed limits.

&gt; Q. Don't higher speed limits cause more accidents and traffic fatalities?

&gt; A. No, if a speed limit is raised to actually reflect real travel speeds, the new higher limit will make the roads safer. When the majority of traffic is traveling at the same speed, traffic flow improves, and there are fewer accidents. Speed alone is rarely the cause of accidents. Differences in speed are the main problem. Reasonable speed limits help traffic to flow at a safer, more uniform pace.

Apparently [35% of marriages now start online](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/one-third-u-s-marriages-start-online-dating-study-article-1.1362743), and [20% of relationships start online](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-blake/online-degree-distance-learning-_b_1557016.html).

With the ability to prescreen people, if your conscience is wrong, is it a possibility that maybe online dating has actually hurt a segment of society?

*EDIT*

What I mean is that perhaps it's best to stick to traditional means for finding that special someone.  And while online dating does work for many people, it's about not all advice on how to accomplish something carries the same weight to all people."

&gt;&gt;""For God's sake, Peggy, can't you write a book instead of reading thousands of them?""[141]

&gt;&gt;To aid her in her literary endeavors, John Marsh brought home a Remington Portable No. 3 typewriter (c. 1928).[110][142] For the next three years Mitchell worked exclusively on writing a Civil War-era novel whose heroine was named Pansy O'Hara (prior to publication Pansy was changed to Scarlett).

recycledpaper,ABCDesis,1391138995.0,"My father was physically abusive towards my mother when I was younger and didn't stop until my mother angrily pointed out that if it was okay for him to beat her then it was sending me the signal okay for my future husband to beat me. As much as I hate that crazy woman sometimes (we recently fought over laundry) I love her and respect her too. Now they are emotionally abusive to each other. She nags him to the point that he doesn't want to contribute anything to the household (everything anyone does around the house is immediately wrong, but we are also horrible people who never help her out). And he has told her that since she was a SAHM and now her kids are all grown she needs to get back to work. Sigh. Sometimes I want to blackmail my parents when I have kids. No visiting your grandbaby until you go to therapy!!

But I feel like you're right about the cycle of abuse. Our parents grew up in an era and culture where beating your child was okay and beating your spouse was okay. And it was okay to call people demeaning terms and make them feel horrible just because you're in a position of authority. I hate hearing how I'm a horrible child, how I should just go an die, ""what did I do in a past life to deserve this"", ad nauseum. My mother should win a prize for ""most overdramatic complaint"". 

My brother and I were not close for a long period of time because he felt like he was always being compared to me academically. My parents would brag about me and not him. I broke down crying when he told me because I realized that my parents made him feel so inferior that it ruined our relationship for awhile. He no longer celebrates Rakhi for this and it kills me a little to know that it's because he feels like second place constantly because of my parents. We are closer now, but I can't help but feel some sort of resentment towards my parents. 

We grew up in houses ""ruled by power, control, domination, and fear"" and let me add to that list ""guilt"". For those of you planning to or already have children, how do you ""break"" this cycle and habit? How do you become parents that rule through ""trust, empathy, and communication""?"

I started in ornamental iron out of school with basic smaw and gtaw certs. I also took blueprint reading and welding inspection 101. 
After a year doing this I was happy but had an opportunity to go work for a race fabrication shop. I learned to REALLY fabricate at this shop. A serious crash course in how it's really done by one hell of a fabricator. I built roll cages, racing seat mounts, fabricated custom exhaust systems, and lots of random bits. I was there a year or so as well, and was essentially laid off. I found work doing stainless TIG work. Did that for awhile, injured myself and lost my job. Then I worked in a waterjet shop for a bit but I left after butting heads with the foreman too often. I am back doing more stainless TIG fabrication fr a small shop. 

I enjoy working for small fabrication shops because there are often different tasks, and you end up doing a lot more of the fabrication and finishing work. You need to become multi talented and able to do a variety of work. I've been in the trade for about 9 years now, and the stainless TIG work has been good work. 
I also work in a decent bit of aluminum, and steel as well.

Another guy I worked with at one point is in a large shop now, and his days are very different from mine, he welds....  That's pretty much it. Though he recently has been trained on running machining equipment.

I've also recently started working towards starting my own fabrication shop, and am doing side work as I can get it. 

So, you can go a lot of places with that education if you apply yourself and interview well, lots of shops will train you, your education proves you can learn skilled labor tasks.

IBiteYou,askaconservative,1391139756.0,"Mayo doesn't speak for all conservatives.  I believe most of us acknowledge that some programs are necessary.  The problem is they seem to get instituted and then never shrink.

In specific regards to food stamps... liberals are ignorant on this right now.

They think the big meanies literally want to take food out of the mouths of babies.

They don't know that food stamps have grown by over 100% in the past five years and what the GOP proposed was a 5% cut...which would have left the program only 95% larger....

http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/behind-the-big-increase-in-food-stamps/

The government relaxed the rules AND paid for an ad campaign to sign people up.

Both parties have agreed to a cut...but of course, liberal sources are immediately blaming Republicans for starving people.

http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2014/0128/Food-stamps-how-House-Senate-negotiators-agreed-to-cut-800-million-a-year-video

If the economy truly is in rebound...as the Democrats seem to be insisting...then a 5% reduction should not have been a big deal.

In short, whenever you hear a ""they want to cut food assitance"" (or similar)  talking point out of the left, always do your own research because the media is likely twanging the big 'ol heartstring guitar and the facts tell a different story."

JTfromOKC,AdviceAnimals,1391139812.0,"Honestly, I would do the same and I find this confession quite inspiring.  Here's why:

When a person finds themselves caught up in a situation that is being controlled and/or directed from levels to which they do not have direct access, one must find a way to not only survive but rise above said situations!  And you did.  Let me explain.

You don't have access to the faculty meetings, you don't have access to her ""higher ups"" and you certainly can't exert ""influence on her"" like you could if you were her boss.  So you assessed the situation, found a way complete the requirements that also gave her more reason to appreciate your work.  Honestly, that's brilliant on your part.

You realized it's simply futile to fight her over the rightness of your position and simply adapted to the current environment and adjusted to the same and overcame.  

You'll find in life that this type of situation will come up many, many times.  Idealists often get squashed, brushed aside and otherwise overlooked in a great many industries.  

Now I'm not saying or advocating that one should ignore their altruistic pursuits.  Not at all.  What I am saying is that there are a great many times in life where it's a good idea to abandon your altruistic beliefs and adjust to the situations in which you find yourself.

Theres no redeeming him, there is no deterrence in either death penalty or life in prison. The second those bombs went off he already inspired potential terrorists, thats why its called extremism.

Sahil17,short,1391140111.0,"/r/short has this immediate desire to say ""Don't fucking do it"" as soon as they hear it. Its been my dream since I've been a little kid (I'm 16 now) to be as big and strong as my dad (5'10). And I think you may have a similar perception with your brother.

So I just wanted to say that because /r/short sometimes gives off this image of believing that if you even think about this surgery you're a fucking idiot. But you're not. This is natural, and fuck whatever anyone else says. 

Now that that's out of the way, let's look at limb lengthening from a more reasonable stand point. Because from an emotional standpoint like yours or mine, the immediate answer is ""yes"". But don't act on impulse. That's when big mistakes happen. 

What I love about limb lengthening: It is becoming better and better. Its becoming safer, less painful and even quicker. If you do it with the right doctor you could get those extra inches.

What I hate: Its expensive as hell. $100,000 (including pain meds and living expenses). But if it does make you happy in the end it may be worth it. But its a gamble. Furthermore, the big fear for me is **THE LONG TERM EFFECTS**. Your bones are being broken and reconnected. It is a bit ""natural"" but if your bones go under such trauma I would expect there to be some major repercussions down the line. What if by the time you're 55, you're already experiencing major pain which doesn't let you run? 

What I recommend: I know this isn't the answer you want but honestly just wait. I have feeling that since demand is becoming higher and higher for this, this surgery is going to improve. I feel that in the next 10 years it will become more efficient and safer, not cheaper (with high demand comes a high price). You said you're young, so don't worry. For now its not worth it, but some day it may be. In the past 10 years they were able to make it an all internal process without the need of that cage around your leg, so think how much more could improve in 10 years. If not 10 then even 5! Exponential growth can occur in such a medical feat. if the demand is there, and I think its there. 


Good Luck. You sound a little depressed too. So check out /r/depression or PM me. If you don't want to do that, seeking medical attention is a good idea (not ideal from your standpoint, but its the best thing). Or find someone to talk to. Talk to your dad or your brother. Someone you can trust and who will be able to sympathize with you.

Sharkictus,TrueChristian,1391140461.0," &gt;You might change your tune in thirty years when overtly religious people are a vanishingly small minority.  Wouldn't be much fun if the businesses in your town decided they didn't want to serve Christians any more, would it?  It's easy to talk about how wonderful discrimination is when you're sitting on top of a huge majority in the population.

I actually wouldn't mind that. Christianity is more accurately shown when its a counter culture. Plus putting Christianity as a meyaphorical collective whole feet into the fire would hem out the nonbelievers who think themselves believers and improve the true believers as a whole..like iron ore into the furnace. 

Its been too complacent, too honoring of the world not God, too self involved.

&gt;Just saying.  You might not always be the majority.  Heck, it might not even take long.  I'd do a little reading on anti-discrimination statutes before you talk your way into a position you come to sincerely regret when it turns on you and yours instead of me and mine.

I'm already a minority in the racial sense. I know enough. I think its wrong for government to force others to not do bad things that aren't physically and actively harmful to others. It isn't the government's job to be that proactive, people hearts and minds should be changed by other people in society, not be forced to think such a way. "

L1M3,nfl,1391140483.0,"&gt; If I said ""Brady is the 6th smartest QB,"" people would call me an idiot, but because Sherman said it, it's a valid opinion. They're both the same opinion, but Sherman's is ""valid"" while mine would probably be called insane. 

[It's called Argument from Authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority).

If Jenny McCarthy tells you that vaccines cause Autism and a doctor/scientist tells you it doesn't, who would you listen to?

Sherman is one of the best CBs in the league, and it's not because he's the fastest or the most physically talented; it's because he's the smartest. And as a CB, at least half of his job is reading the Quarterback and studying QBs on film. His word isn't gospel, but he's not making a random guess. He also spends time with Russell every day. Maybe that makes him biased, or maybe it lets him see something that we don't.

Would I expect - or pick - Russel to be in the top 5 smartest QBs? Not really. The guy might be the hardest worker in the league, but I would think youth and inexperience would be a big limiting factor at this point. Apparently, being young is not something that Sherman feels is a big detriment, as Russ is not the only young QB he put on his list. He even put Cam at 7."

Yup.

For me, they used a lot of nitrous oxide, much more than typical, and a lot more local anesthetic than usual, plus a long pause to let that all soak in.

Do NOT take benzodiazepines without consulting the dentist first!  I did that once, and they sent me straight home without a treatment.  Those interfere with respiration and dentists require special training and licensing to deal with the issues.

mmmsoap,Frugal,1391141056.0,"&gt; Quite frankly these bills are straight scams - you can normally negotiate a lower rate but since you had insurance pay 300 dollars already it may be harder to get that lower rate now. It is not uncommon for hospitals to make you pay %500-%750 more than they are paying for whatever they did for you (this is directly related to how terrible our health care system is). I don't like insurance - at all - and I think it is a massive scam.

That's not really what's happening here. 

OP has a deductible. That means that the hospital is billing her insurance *at their agreed upon rate*, not the inflated cost passed on to the uninsured. The insurance company approves the rates and the charges, and verifies that it's all in line with what they would pay. The only difference is that OP's family is responsible for the first $3000 of care (in the high deductible plans I've seen that jive with the ACA, the deductible tends to apply mostly towards labs/x-rays/tests, not much else) before the insurance company will start paying the bills.

It's unlikely that the hospital is going to negotiate down, because OP has insurance and they're billing her at the insurance rate. A typical charge might be: $500 for X test, but only  $150 ""allowed"" by insurance ($150 is what the insurance company has agreed to pay). So the hospital writes off the other $350, and sends the bill *for $150, not $500* to OP."

psychicsword,AskReddit,1391141443.0,They are probably somewhat true but you have to remember that it is also a very small percent of the population which is why the stories are worth telling even to other Americans. Only 15% of the US is uninsured and less than that have problems while uninsured. You also have to remember that there is some level of confusion even within those kinds of stats. Does uninsured mean that they were uninsured 2 days while switching jobs and employer sponsored plans or does it mean they were uninsured for months or even the full year. The people transitioning between jobs problem could be solved by detaching healthcare from employment(48% of all Americans get insurance through their employer). Another large chunk could be solved if we figured out how to solve our rising cost problem which may or may not require switching to a single payer. You also have the right to refuse all treatment although in some cases they can force it on you anyway and who gets billed probably depends on the jurisdiction. There is also an ability to negotiate after you get the bill. In some cases you can pay what the insurance companies pay(typically this works best for emergency services rather than planned services that you didn't investigate the costs associated with the top tier hospital).  We also have a large number of problems in our health care system which is why it takes up a large percent of our political discussion right now and we spent so long just trying to get the ACA passed.

&gt;Besides the broad appeal rights granted by the Italian law, an ulterior incentive to appeal is given by the fact that Italy has a very high amendment rate during the appeal process. Approximately half of all sentences rendered in the first trial are amended during the appeal process, a percentage which is 3 times higher than France for example. The ones that are not amended often see a decrease in punishment.

&gt;No surprise therefore that Italians always appeal their sentences. And some analysts have even ventured to say that Italian appeal courts like to modify the sentences of the first trial just for the purpose of justifying their own existence.

Similar things have been reported in many media sources since the beginning of this trial and that's an anti-Knox site. Initial trials in Italy have a relatively very low percentage of standing as is. That's not in question. I never said the US system was perfect, but it's certainly better and more fair than the Italian system has been shown to be in this case at the minimum. Mignini has straight up fabricated bizarre stories with no evidence in multiple cases beyond just the Knox case and has even been convicted of crimes for it, though he got it dropped on a technicality. I said rich people are more likely to get off in America. None of what you has anything to do with this case, nor shows the prosecution's case against Knox and Sollecito wasn't a complete clusterfuck. It was.

Me- ""excuse me? Its called swatching""

Then up at the register they were harassing this lady about a return.  Seemed legit, she had a receipt, but not the packaging because it had been a gift.  That lady left almost in tears.  The next customer threw her stuff on the counter and said that what the cashier did was uncalled for and she didnt want to shop at a store with such fake people.

""Im being my genuine self."" Retorted the cashier

""Well then you are genuinely a bitch!"" Said the customer as she walked out the door.

vorpalblab,AskMen,1391142051.0,"There are a number of issues in the Canadian systtem you have to learn and game out a bit.

If you only see a doctor when you are sick, the doc has no baseline data to see what is abnormal for you, instead the doc needs to compare with the generic male of your age.

Second, you are not gonna be as well followed and risk being in the long lineup when you do wanna be looked after because doctor's practices tend to grow to the limit of their ability to see patients. You don't wanna be the one who can't be squeezed in.

Also if you need something a GP does not treat - your GP is the doorway to the specialist world where they demand a referral from a GP before seeing you.

I mentioned a little twinge at my last semi annual visit, and I am off for x-rays at my convenience next week for a minor problem, to find out if really is something, and can something be done before it gets major.

All these visits to the doc (annual mostly) have kept me alive to 70 now and I am in great shape with plenty o miles to go.

And no it isn't free. I pay taxes, and the cost comes outta my taxes. So I try to use the system responsibly.

It is cheaper and better to catch stuff before it gets major. That needs monitoring.

My own theory is that the cost of monitoring is what discourages Americans from seeing a doc regularly, and they have an average of 2 years less life span than Canadians."

At the time of Columbus' landing in 1492, the Grand Duchy of Moscow (the predecessor of the Tsardom of Russia) did not extend beyond the Ural Mountains. The expansion into Siberia was a very gradual process of conquest and settlement, and Russia did not reach to the Pacific ocean until the mid-17th century.

That is not to say that there were no travelers to North America from Siberia by non-Russians, however.

Nor do I.  Something I learned a long time ago is that not everyone is as good at any given job as everyone else, and not everyone puts in the same level of effort.  Someone more skilled may be lazy, someone less skilled may be a workaholic, someone else might come up with labor saving ideas to get more done.  All of this may or may not be evident to others in the same position, particularly if they don't work next to each other.

I don't worry too much about what someone else is making for the job.  Where pay is an issue, I concern myself with whether or not **I** feel underpaid.  If I do, I ask for more or move.  There's a name for getting upset that someone else has more.  Its called envy."

3. People in this subreddit keep using flashy words as an excuse like ""panic-buying"" when it holds no relevance. We had a month to make changes we knew needed to be made. There is nothing stopping us from at least getting some good loans to mend our weak spots until the end of the season. Not finances, not injuries. ***Nothing.***

I'm sorry and not to be rude, but how can anyone honestly upvote this? 

&gt;But this summer, with all the money from the puma deal and another year for our players to develop will allow us to really, truly thrive next year. People forget that we were not suppose to come close to the title this year. Dont worry be patient and we will have our glory.

Now this is the sad part. What justification do you give for making such claims when we have consistently maintained first place throughout the entire season? You are acting as though it was a given for us to not win the league this season despite our team's stellar performance. You have effectively given up while the team you're a fan of was ahead in the race. That makes absolutely no sense to me.

I heard that in a closed-door meeting...really, I did.  I'm writing a book about it.

Do you understand me?

Obama dictated some policy he wanted that the GOP was necessarily going to oppose, because their voters oppose it.  And the Senate is sitting on over 200 bills passed by the House...why?

To say one side is just unreasonably obstructionist...and the other side doesn't obstruct is wrong.

And the top comment here is not sourced by ANYTHING legitimate.

Obama IS a partisan.  He was the most liberal Senator in the Senate before he was elected.

http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/31/study-obama-most-liberal-senator-last-year/

The democrats SHUT DOWN THE government SEVEN times under Reagan.

We don't like Obama's policies.  We disagree with democrat solutions to things.  Why do democrats have such a hard time understanding that?

keypuncher,politics,1391142687.0,"&gt; Ok. so during one of the most active storm seasons in history they shouldn't repair and extend the floodwater control systems for the most populous city in the United States and the approx 40 million people who lived in cities who were also affected by the storm?

Sure they should - but you realize that the storm was in 2012, the bill passed in 2013, and 80% of the money appropriated in that bill wasn't slated to be spent in 2013, right?

So, if the storm happens in September, and the President waits 2 months to even submit a request for emergency aid to Congress, and the vast majority of the spending in the bill isn't going to happen for at least a year, that spending isn't an appropriate topic for an emergency bill.

&gt; When should they do it? You do realize they had no idea if another storm was going to be coming weeks later.

If it was, then that spending would certainly have helped plan to avoid storms that took place in... 2014-5 and later."

katacarbix,edmproduction,1391142754.0,"Sorry in advance for the long post, but you'll like it!

My parents put me through piano lessons from around 4-10. I hated it. I didn't really learn anything I thought was meaningful. I tried learning all kinds of instruments,
But I just got bored and dropped them.

In 5th grade I think, my brother bought Acid music studio and I had some fun arranging loops in that. I put them on my iPod and showed them to my friends.

Not long after I got an iBook because of some weird obsession I had with Apple that just sprung up. No idea why it happened, but I was happy with it. It came with GarageBand, so I put together some loops and stuff. Still cool, but I never did anything more than that and I didn't really feel content with that.

Then at the end of 6th grade I got a MacBook because I really liked the iBook but I took it apart one too many times and it broke. It also has GarageBand and I kinda did the same thing. But some of the things I did had the default synths used.

Also around this time I really started to discover my most influential side of EDM. I have this one friend who shares a lot of interests with me. He showed me hardstyle, rave, Melbourne shuffle, all that cool stuff. So that was mainly what I listened to then.

I still have that MacBook. I bought Logic Pro in August and my production knowledge skyrocketed. I've been diagnosed with a disease that creates tumors on my auditory nerves since halfway through 6th grade. This means I will need surgery in some years to remove them and I will become fully deaf. Near the end of the life of my hearing I hope to put together a charity album to sell for donations to the disease's research.

TL;DR: hated playing music as a kid, now it's my #1 hobby."

psychicsword,AskReddit,1391143035.0,"There are a lot of reasons and everyone seems to have their own mix of them. 

* For one it isn't a guarantee of lower costs, for all we know the government will be just as unable to negotiate on prices as the average american. Given how much we just spent on a website that didn't work I don't count that out as a possibility. 
* There is a higher chance of corruption when industries are taken over by the government but still left to a pseudo-capitalist market. The last thing we need is a medical industrial complex as well.
* It increases dependence on the government. Right now we have a major medicare sustainability problem and yet we are having a hard time putting solutions in place because the people it helps(old people) refuse the concept of cutbacks even if it is in the best interest of the long term success of the country. While this might improve more with a larger range of age groups universal healthcare would still favor the old far more than it helps with the young. Do you think our system of government would ever be able to pass cutbacks on the healthcare spending when old people are the largest groups of voters in the country and hold huge political power?
* It removes all aspects of customization. As a young 24 year old who has 0 medical issues it would be better for me to sign up for a plan that only offered a minimal level of protection so I can use the difference in premiums to help build my economic foundation. Partially self insuring would be beneficial to me because I can use that large emergency fund for many different areas.
* Some people think that we might be able to solve most of our issues without rebuilding our entire economic and government structure by doing other things. Some people say we should have multi-state exchanges, some people say we need to open the door to more competition, some people say we need torte reform, some people say we need to detach healthcare from employment to get it so everyone is shopping around like we do for auto insurance, and many other small fixes that people think would add up to bring us closer to the kind of prices you guys get from a single payer demanding certain prices from the private industry. Most people think we should make hundreds of small changes that each bring down the cost for everyone. 
* Some people simply don't like sharing their money that they feel they earned.(I dont personally follow this one)

I'm sure some of these views are explained poorly but that is largely because I only believe in a few aspects of them myself. I am partially American Libertarian myself so I mostly generally like to keep the government out of my life as much as possible along with the idea that some areas should be tightened up and properly regulated(I'm not fully Libertarian).

sockmonkeysaurus,relationships,1391143804.0,"There is always going to be someone out there that shares the same kinks as you. That's the thing that sucks about kinks; it's a bit taboo to casually bring it up in conversation, and what works for one person may be a turn off to another. Those are things you discover in relationships with people, once you reach a point where you feel comfortable talking about turn-ons. Find someone who is accepting of different sexualities.

&gt; I don't think women are going to like that

Like I said, there is someone out there for everyone. Your fetish is not my cup of tea by a long shot, but there are so many women out there who would be willing to indulge your fetish. Specifically, someone who is into Femdom would most likely fit with your sexual tastes.

&gt;It isn't a healthy fetish. But I'm stuck

Fetishes are like your favorite guilty pleasure food. I *love* those little candy marshmallow circus peanut things. I could eat a whole bag in one shot, easy. And maybe after I eat a whole bag, I feel a little regret, but it didn't really hurt me or anyone else. I enjoyed myself eating that whole bag. And just because those little marshmallow circus peanut candies are my guilty pleasure, it doesn't mean that every single time I eat candy, it's going to be those. You can mix it up a bit.

Your fetish isn't a harmful one. It's a fairly common one, actually. But it's nothing to be ashamed of. Everyone has their own kinks, though some are a little more extreme than others. And everyone has kinks that they would be willing to indulge. It's a matter of finding someone you are comfortable communicating with, and letting them know more about your sexual preferences."

I had just graduated high school a week or so before. I had a decent job as a prep chef at a good restaurant. Wasn't making a ton of money but made a decent amount for an 18 year old. Anywho, so I'm off one day and extremely bored. My buddy Anthony calls me and asks if I wanna hang out and smoke weed. Sure thing! So I grab my bag of weed, pocket it, and start walking to his place. While walking down the road a white and heavily tinted car pulls up to me fast and erratically. Two undercover cops jump out. 

&gt;Fuuuuuuuuuck

18 year old me was kind of an idiot (obviously) so I try and run away. They tackle me. I immediately gave up. So I'm sitting on the sidewalk handcuffed and they search me and find the bag of weed.

&gt;Fuuuuuuuuuuck

So first **TL;DR** I get arrested for possession of marijuana, resisting arrest, and battery on a law enforcement officer (apparently the ""struggle"" when they tacked me counted as battery). 

So I spend the night in jail, parents flip, I get released, get a court date, blah blah blah. 

Eventually my employer at the restaurant finds out. They let me go. They didn't want to risk having me going to jail if the court date didn't go my way, so they cut ties on their terms. 

So I was now jobless and eventually my dad kicks me out because I couldn't pay him rent anymore. 

A few months pass by of me sleeping on a couch trying to find a job. No one will hire the guy who has pending criminal charges, especially battery on a cop! So it was impossible for me to find new work. 

My court date comes up. They drop all the charges! Awesome right! Kinda. This was in the latter half of 2008 when the economy took a nose dive, and I'm from Orlando where we got it real bad, so finding was impossible. 

So I walk into a recruiters office and joined the U.S. Army. To this day that was the best day of my life. And it was all because my buddy Antony wanted to get high. "

keypuncher,politics,1391145442.0,"&gt; &gt; Democrats have gotten a stimulus
&gt; 
&gt; Which Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe only agreed to after it was reduced to a size that limited its effectiveness.

The stimulus was nearly a $trillion dollars - that's 1/4 of the Federal Budget, and about 40% of our revenues.  If that wasn't going to do it, no amount would.  ...and as it happened, it didn't, because economies don't work that way, so the money was wasted.

&gt; &gt; the ACA

&gt; Which originally was a concept thought up by Republicans and introduced in multiple bills by Republicans, a prime example of Republicans moving the goal posts.

No.  The Heritage plan was not the ACA, and there were about three Congressmen in favor of it, which is why it was never brought to a vote.

&gt; &gt; a tax hike on the wealthiest

&gt; ...which in actuality was a return to pre-Bush tax cut levels.

Oh no.  That was only part of it.  There were a bunch more tax hikes on the wealthy, like the new Medicare tax on capital gains.

&gt; Also, Republicans like Paul Ryan advocated for the sequester like a mad man. They got it.

So did the President (since it was his plan) - until he got it.

Not that it ever really mattered - a 1% cut to the Federal budget when we are spending 40% more than our revenues is almost meaningless.  The President's Washington Monument Syndrome antics and histrionics were one of the things that cost him a lot of support.

&gt; &gt; what has the GOP gotten?

&gt; Sequester cuts.

That was the President's plan.  The GOP wanted a budget cut deal, the Sequester was the fallback that nobody wanted.  The President thought the Republicans would cave on that to avoid cuts to the military, and he was wrong.

&gt; Cuts to food stamps.

Expiration of a temporary increase, after spending on food stamps doubled (recipients went up 30%).

&gt; No immigration reform.

Wrong - the President did his ""Dream Act"" by Executive Action after Congress voted it down, told the Border Patrol to stop securing the border during the shutdown, and allowed thousands of imprisoned illegals to go free.  The Senate passed SB744, the House hasn't brought a bill to a vote yet.  So, Republicans did not ""get"" anything here.

&gt; No ENDA passage.

The Senate passed ENDA November of last year.

&gt; Cuts to veterans' pensions.

There aren't any cuts to military pensions.  There is a cut to the cost of living increase, and Patty Murray (D-WA) was involved in drafting that.  Most Republicans are against it.

&gt; Very very few tax loopholes closed.

Democrats want those for their cronies just as much as Republicans do for theirs.  That's a wash.

&gt; Expansion in oil drilling on public lands.

No.  In fact, permits for drilling on public lands that had previously been approved were rescinded, and drilling on public lands has taken a nosedive since Obama became President.

&gt; Expansion of offshore oil drilling.

Again, no.  Not only did the President put a moratorium in place that was long enough for the mobile rigs to have to move elsewhere, permits for new drilling now that the moratorium has been lifted are being held up.

&gt; If Republicans had not gerrymandered Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin, South Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Florida, Missouri, Tennessee, and many other states, the House would have gone to Democrats in 2012 by a landslide.

Keep dreaming.  You realize the national popular vote is very close, right?"

Blindocide,philosophy,1391145857.0,"Just wanted to pop in and say the structure of our brain is exactly why we perceive the ""flow of time"".

First off: we don't actually perceive a ""flow of time"". What we *really* perceive are ""later"" states in which we can remember ""previous"" states.

This is because our brain is a physical system, and physical systems have an asymmetry in entropy levels over time; we usually say ""a closed system will have greater entropy as time increases""..

Entropy has also been shown to tie directly into the information content of a system. The more entropy a system has, the more information that system has.

As your brain takes in information and processes it into memories, the entropy of your brain increases; your ""later"" states remember your ""previous"" states, in the same way a pool table of billiard balls contains the information of its initial state in its end state.

BONUS READING: Now what's fucked is the fact that there is nothing in our understanding of physics that tells us, objectively, which direction time moves. In fact, it is Lochsmidt's paradox that entropy is time-asymmetrical when everything else in our universe is time-symmetrical.

You can do physics accurately backwards and forwards if you wanted to, it doesn't matter to the equations. But for whatever reason, one end of our universe has remarkably low entropy, the other end has remarkably high entropy, and in the intermittent steps the systems we call ""us"" are able to reference previous states in order to predict future states and manipulate present states.


shit's fucked, bro.

EDIT: If you were really clever, you could get all the information about the end state from the initial state. so, yeah. shit's fucked."

I'm becoming something of a highlighter fiend of late and I'm now considering getting another (or two, or all) from them. But I've been trying to find swatches of all the Fyrinnae highlighters side-by-side and haven't had much luck. If anyone knows of such an image or owns all of the highlighters and is willing to swatch them that would be much appreciated.

And in case anyone is interested, I find [this](http://beautysbadhabitblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/little-bit-o-fyrinnae.html) blog post has a decent swatch of how Center Stage looks (I find that's how it looks blended in). "

Got in trouble looking up all the things my parents didn't allow, then got out of trouble by blackmailing my dad (ie, let me do whatever I want on this computer &amp; I won't show mom all the porn you've been looking at).

Stayed up til 3 or 4 in the morning as an IRCop when I was 14 years old. Left my name all over the place in some forums I no longer want to be associated with, but that's life. Was around for warez that were reasonably safe and Napster before it got screwed up. 

The creepy guys that would try to hit me up for cybersex in chatrooms. The creepier Gorean guys that would try to hit me up for cyberBDSM on yahoo messenger. The meta-creeps who would offer me their ""collar of protection"" to keep the other creeps away, if I'd get naked on webcam, of course.

Called my friend's mom and ratted her out because she met some old pedo online and was going to move to Florida with him. Six years later, she moved to New Zealand to be with a guy she met on Fetlife - some people never learn.   
OTOH, I ended up going to prom with a guy I met on a forum and through IRC, but we talked on the phone almost every night for close to 2 years beforehand.

Fluxxed0,spikes,1391148348.0,"The version of the deck I ran for THS Game Day had Rootborn Defenses, Boon Satyr, and a much lower curve to combat the control/RDW/WWx meta that was prevalent at the time.  I wrote a primer for that version too, which you can see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1otbqw/standard_gw_tokens_primer_game_day_winning_deck/).

Your version of the deck is heavily tuned against control, and your Esper and UW matchups are much better than mine.  However, I'm not convinced that this version is better against the field in general.  By removing the interactivity and adding more small creatures, it seems like your gameplan is to play every matchup as a race.  Mono-B and mono-U are specifically built to beat that strategy, so how do you carry out your matchups against those decks?  How do you handle Desecration Demon if you don't have one of your four Charms in hand?

Anyway, I believe that if the brain doesn't receive a signal, it's not actually pain.  My ethical reasoning is based on not wanting to disrupt something that wants to sustain itself, unless it does so at the expense of disrupting other systems that want to sustain themselves.  Since a neuron on its own can't sustain itself, I don't consider it ""feeling"" anything.  When it's connected to a brain and motor neurons, though, it becomes part of a larger system that can sustain itself.  That's when I consider it feeling pain, and when I have an aversion to destroying it."

1. Physical Touch (hand holding, hugging, kissing, etc)

2. Gift Giving (bought or made)

3. Words of Affirmation (""I love you"" or any verbal things)

4. Quality Time (know how your grandma wants to just spend time with you? It's like that.)

5.Favors (Doing things like helping your SO with homework, making dinner, fixing something for them, etc)

They are capable of striking upwards from that position *way* faster than you could possibly react.  These snakes are longer and thinner, which puts them farther away from your hand and they have leverage working against them, so they would have a very hard time striking upwards faster than you could interrupt them or just drop them.  

Also note that at around 2:10 he says that it's important to hold them high up on the tail.  They are skinny and weak there, and can't use it as an effective anchor point to strike, as they could if you held them on a thick part.

Also, while the Tiger Snake is indeed quite nasty, the Red-bellied Black Snake isn't *that* dangerous.  They often dry bite (no venom) and while their venom is unpleasant, and kills muscle tissue, there have been no known adult human deaths.  The Puff Adder, on the other hand, is incredibly dangerous, one of the worst of the vipers, and causes more deaths than any other African snake (which isn't entirely because of how bad the venom is, they also have a wide range, like to sit still on paths, and have much much nastier fangs ([adder](http://www.biolib.cz/IMG/GAL/38088.jpg) and [*Pseudechis* (Red-bellied Black Snake's genus)](http://www.natureswindow.dk/RMI_2007/rmi20071011_083.jpg) skulls)."

Zaranthan,Warframe,1391148950.0,"A rundown of the Steam Starter Pack, since it's not obvious what all that's worth as a newbie:

As you can see, this is $25 worth of platinum, but no discounts can apply.

&gt;100,000 credits

This is at most, ten missions (find an invasion, get two 50k battle pays). So, an hour of playing.

&gt;6 Common MOD Cards

Commons are worth even less in Warframe than they are in most CCGs. You'll get half a dozen mods just by killing everything in a mission.

&gt;4 Rare MOD Cards

Rares are nice, but this is maybe four missions' worth of loot.

&gt;Affinity Booster

&gt;Credit Booster

Boosters are great, IF you're going to be playing quite a bit while they're in effect AND you've got access to stuff that's worth farming up affinity/credits AND you actually need that right now (credits, in particular, are rarely in short supply after you buy the first few weapons and before you start wanting to burn your Fusion Cores).

So, you get half the platinum you would have (probably much less), and about a dozen missions' worth of loot upfront. Meh. As others have said, wait for your login reward to be a platinum discount."

Numbchicken,Conservative,1391149075.0,"I don't consider myself conservative on many issues, but I am pro death penalty. Some crimes are so heinous, that they warrant the highest punishment possible. I am for it, when the evidence is substantial. Individuals like John Wayne Gacy should have gotten the death penalty, because there is no justice in keeping him behind bars where he will never be redeemed. Why shouldn't this guy receive the death penalty? All I see from anti death penalty people, is this argument: ""we are better than him so we shouldn't stoop to his level"" and because death penalty is ""revenge""? Can anyone here give me their definition of justice without it correlating to revenge? 

And  about the ""we would look like we stooped to his level if we executed him, we should be better than him?"" Did his victims commit a capital crime? Get arrested, get charged with a crime, go on trial in front of a jury of their peers, and get convicted of the crime by the jury and then sentenced to death and then executed? No, they were murdered, in cold blood. If this guy is executed its because he will go through each of the check list I stated, and then executed. Its like saying ""Why should we imprison kidnappers for kidnapping people? They took someone against their will, and we're taking them against their will, so aren't we stooping to their level?"" Its the most inarticulate, but common argument against the death penalty

And I dont know why everyone is only putting his life on this pedistule. His life is not the only one that should be measured in that court room, not the only face for us to remember, imagine the last moments of the victims lives. Innocent people were watching a marathon, innocent children who didn't have a care in the world were just enjoying their day, and this terrorist comes in knowing what he is about to do, starts planting those bombs and in a split second all of those innocent people are going through the most agonizing pain. While he was running from the scene im sure he heard the screams and the agony coming from all of those people, and at no point was there any signs of remorse. The death penalty was created for the worst crimes as the ultimate punishment and he deserves this punishment. "

phenger,computerforensics,1391149318.0,"In order to be successful as a consultant, you need to have experience in the real world. You need to be exposed to different work environments to understand the technical and political challenges that different companies and environments offer.

That being said, you don't have to be a complete expert before you start shopping your resume around. Most consulting firms have programs to help train up people who have the mindset and initial knowledge, but lack in other areas. This is actually how I got started, but it was after about 6-7 years as a sysadmin at a few companies. You'll also have better luck if you look for general IT consulting work first, and then migrate into a more security-focused consulting company as you gain more real-world experience.

Certs will help you get your foot in the door and past HR check boxes, but as anyone in IT will tell you, experience is much better than certs. If you really want to go into security, get some security-focuses certs too. The CEH is a good starting place, as is the Security+.

All of that being said, I've met and worked with some 21-22yr olds that are insanely sharp and are top consultants in their areas at their companies. I'm not saying that it can't happen when your younger and have less experience - I'm just saying it's rare."

To get a good idea tomorrow track what you eat. Write down everything and calculate what its calorie content is. I'm betting you'll find 50% more than you expect."

The reason your transmission shifts hard into gear is from your high idle. Higher idle raises the line pressure for the transmission, which causes a harder/firmer shift engagement. Your high idle also accounts for your loss of MPG."

Here in Michigan, all road plowing falls on county road commissions, and they never seen to have enough money. 

It could snow 6 inches and it would still take the better part of a day to get a single plow onto the interstate, say nothing of state highways and city streets. If you live out in the country, don't expect to have your road plowed at all. You just have to drive across it so many times that it packs down enough to not eat your car.

But, nothing shuts down for snow. Many employers will threaten to fire people who get stuck in the snow, even if they have photos and a copy of the towing bill. It's a case of ""You live in Michigan. You should already know how to deal with this.""

Where you could show not enough of your flirty side to one woman, another might see you coming a mile away. There really is no perfect approach.

If you are unfamiliar with the production of the movie, there was a new live camera tracking technique Keanu was developing for the movie. I don't have the link but think Matrix style shots only captured in camera live. Unfortunately the rig required to capture the shots was not able to be taken to China for filming. As a result the fight cinematography suffers.

Despite this drawback the fights are decent and the movies string point. The plot and characters are simple and adhere to tropes. You do get to see Keanu as a bad guy. Something that I hope he does more of."

FeatherDie,AskWomen,1391152118.0,"Depends on what you're actually trying to do. 

1. If you want to increase the amount of healthy hair per square inch of skin, well you might be able to. There are treatments ranging from home remedies to Rogaine for the ladies. (They pretty much create optimal environments for hair growth, making the hairs that are getting broken off or not growing at all come to the light)

2. If you want the hair you grow to be thicker in diameter, well I don't know that there is a way to do that unfortunately. As someone with baby fine hair, I WISH! 

3. Most people use volumizing (not sure if word) products, which I have no idea how they work, to make their hair appear overall much thicker. They also style it (teasing, blow-drying) in all sorts of ways.

I don't even try anymore, but getting a perm for my extremely straight hair definitely gives it more width/volume to the naked eye. i also look adorable with curls. It's quite sickening."

onewordmemory,AdviceAnimals,1391152431.0,"when the topic of abortions comes up, i'm always curious to know what the person thinks in each specific situation, not just their general 'pro-life' or 'pro-choice' stance, *especially* if they're pro-life.

* rape - i can't imagine any sane human beings argue for keeping children caused by rape
* serious health issues with the pregnancy - again, i dont think sane people would argue the mother should be forced to risk her own life for the fetus
* birth control failing - i can see someone argue the 'shit happens, live with it' if they truly believe abortion is murder, but i myself cant imagine forcing anyone to pay the price for something neither of them were really responsible for. *especially* after trying everything to prevent it (i say everything because in my mind, abstinence isn't an option)
* stupidity - the whole ""you have access to birth control but refuse to use it, then get pregnant, should you be forced to have the kid"". this is in my mind the only realistic scenario where the argument can be even had. the ""pay the price"" argument is completely valid here and i would be for it if it meant only the parents get punished (with extra work, expenses, etc). however that's not usually the case, many of these would end in abandonment or resentment which would put the burden on the child and/or society. so even in this case i'm pro-choice simply because it's the lesser evil :(

i'd love to hear someone argue otherwise though, maybe there *are* some sane arguments I have missed.

edit: i got a couple responses with specific examples where a pregnancy caused by rape wasnt aborted by choice and the result was a fantastic human being. that's great, but i'd like to clarify that noone is arguing for *forcing* abortions in those (or any other) cases. with pro-choice, those specific examples would still exist. the positives of pro-life choices would still exist in pro-choice world, while the positives of pro-choice would cease if pro-life was enforced."

Personally, I don't like VNs either, but I did like Long Live The Queen. Mostly because I found it to be comparatively few text to click though before you get to your first decisions (I downloaded some VN demos where it seemed like you had to click through 10 minutes of text before the game let you do *anything*). They (MD and LLTQ) have no h content whatsoever (the game dev is actually a Western female, inspired by anime/visual novels and doing her own spin on it). 

I heard Loren Warrior princess actually had some h-y content (can't be too much since it was possible to release it on steam) but it actually has something akin to a battle system (which make it fairly heavy for a VN, compared to a normal game the combat is still fairly abstracted out).

crashonthebeat,AskReddit,1391153238.0,"One of the best ways I think is just to be a musician yourself, and start recording and mixing your own songs in your bedroom. You can spend less than $500 for an okay recording setup (you can get a pretty good recording setup if you're willing to pirate), as long as you have your instruments.

Or just find raw tracks on the internet and start practicing with them in a Digital Audio Workstation. Figure out what different track effects do, **learn how EQ works**, and just kind of experiment until you know what sounds good, and can make something sound however you want it to. If you want to do it professionally, I'd say that you need a good amount of experience listening to all different kinds of music. Then, go around and ask if people need an album produced. Set up shop in their practice space if you don't have enough room for instruments, and then go to town. Then you just build up equipment, experience, and a portfolio.

I'm an bedroom amateur ""audio engineer"" at best, but I can make a mix sound solid, even with my own horrible playing. What I described above is the path I see myself taking if I wanted to get serious about it. So, it is by no means an actual path than an actual audio engineer would take."

theidleidol,magicTCG,1391153626.0,"I can't provide a rule (on my phone), but the explanation I received when first trying to wrap my head around this interaction was as follows: 

When assigning combat damage to a creature (or a stack of creatures all blocking together) the attacker must assign a **lethal amount of damage** to the front most blocker, then to the next one, etc. until out of blockers or damage to assign. If the attacking creature has trample any leftovers are dealt to the defending player. For example: a 7/7 being blocked by a 3/3 and a 2/2. The attacking player uses up 2 damage to kill the 2/2, 3 damage to kill the 3/3, and if the attacking creature has trample the defending player takes 2. I assume this is all repeating stuff you already know. The important part is it takes 2 damage to kill the 2/2 and 3 damage to kill the 3/3, and then the leftover damage disappears unless the attacker has trample.

Deathtouch means any amount of damage that creature does is lethal damage. 1 damage is lethal damage, regardless of the other creature's toughness.

When you combine those two abilities, as the attacker assigns lethal damage he only needs one damage per blocker because that's what deathtouch does. 1 damage is lethal to the first blocker, the next 1 damage is lethal to the next blocker, etc. This works, again, because the rules for assigning damage to multiple blockers call for **lethal damage**, not the amount of toughness the creature has. 1 damage from deathtouch us lethal, so that's enough."

The only new thing we will learn is whether he will recover competely or not - and it might be weeks or months before this can be said with any certainty.

I thought it was awesome, from the colors to the logo to the overall feel of it, and so I became at least interested in the Hawks.

And they'll come at fairly regular intervals (though not always, but they'll still last about the same amount of time from start to finish and I feel like that's the more important measurement in determining if it's really labor). The way I would categorize real labor contractions isn't by the standard that many doctors will say ""when you can't talk through them"". They're right, but even more correct would be ""when you can't stand to hear other people talk during them"". Because you have to concentrate on them and can't be distracted. You'll find yourself saying ""shhh don't talk"" or ""shh just shut up"" and then you can apologize when it's over haha.

Instead of having to blindly pay the high price for the deluxe edition before even playing the game, you can play the game for the normal price and *then*, if you like the game, elect to upgrade to the deluxe edition. If you don't see yourself playing the game for very long, however, you save $20. 

Or maybe you don't have the money for the deluxe edition right now - no worries, you can still pay the normal price now to get early access and upgrade later for the same price you would pay now, and you don't have to worry about missing out on any goodies. 

Or perhaps you find the standard game for a very low price long after the deluxe edition is no longer available at retailers; well, you can buy the discounted box copy and upgrade to the deluxe edition, you bargain hunter.

It smells like real apples instead of those crappy artificial scents. So I applies it the last several days and it's made my skin tones more moisturized (I have dry, sensitive skin) and super soft.

For example, say a guy's favorite race is khajit. But he hates the Aldmeri Dominion and could never be truly proud to play with that faction. But he really respects the values of the Dagerfall Covenant; he would be proud to fight for them. So he makes his khajit on DC, and is all the more loyal for it because he knows he chose his favorite faction and favorite race without being forced to be a member of Aldmeri Dominion."

I'm sorry, but your argument just doesn't make sense to me. If a male applicant would be able to perform more tasks and more stressful tasks, than a female applicant, why should the female applicant be hired rather than the clearly more qualified male applicant?

From my observation...there are less and less conservatives here all the time because, who wants to deal with ignorant abuse?

And it is ignorant abuse.  Some people just downvote with malice and engage with hostility, when they do.

I sometimes think it would do liberals good to go to a forum that is conservative in nature and try to express themselves and deal with the type of behavior conservatives deal with here.

For heaven's sake, the moderators made a post a week or so ago saying people shouldn't be abusive in comments and some people argued that they should be able to be abusive in comments.

And these are the same people who want anti-bullying measures in schools.

BonzoTheBoss,todayilearned,1391158036.0,"Actually decolonisation efforts began as soon as 1945, immediately after the Second World War. With war time rationing still in effect and the country essentially bankrupt despite emerging victorious, the British public were more concerned with affairs at home rather than maintaining an empire they neither wanted nor could afford anymore.

In the 1945 general election a pro-decolonisation Labour government was voted into power, which immediately set about giving India it's independence and enacting a policy of ""peaceful disengagement"" from the colonies. By 1981 all former colonies except a smattering of tiny islands and outposts (British Overseas Territories, as they are now known) had achieved independence.

Still, it did take 35 years for the ""sun to set"" on the British Empire. And it wasn't always a peaceful transition. (Just look at the partition of India, or the Mau Mau uprising...) But it could be argued it was one of the more peaceful endings to an empire we've seen throughout history."

JAWJAWBINX,AskReddit,1391158210.0,"About five years ago I tried to commit suicide for the first and thus far only time. There's a lot of background information of how it got to that but I'll leave it out since it's basically my life story up to that point (I was around 16). My mom and I had gotten into an argument, she couldn't understand what I was trying to say (I don't even remember what it was about, she simply couldn't make sense of the way I worded it) so as usual she began to get made at me for making no sense and I got frustrated with myself. She interpreted my frustration as anger at her and got pissed at me and I just got even more frustrated, I understand why now but at the time I didn't and didn't have enough control to shut down my emotions and stop the cycle. Eventually my frustration turns into hatred, I hated that I couldn't simply get along with her, I hated that I was different, I hated that I needed to put in so much effort to be understood, I hated that I wasn't like my brother, I hated my very existence. She storms off and I curl up on a couch nearby sobbing for at least an hour and eventually I wander upstairs to talk to her (our basement is finished and my computer was down there). She's not any calmer and as soon as she sees me she starts yelling at me again and suddenly I feel a change, I knew what it was because it had been the norm for six years at that point but it was late so I figured things would be fine since my mom would be going to bed soon. After at least an hour of her yelling at me and me trying to apologize (and being yelled at for it), telling her that I didn't know what I had done or what she wanted from me (and being yelled at for it), trying to explain how I felt to her (and being yelled at for not making sense and lying), and simply being to stressed to speak (I think you know what she did) we ended up in the kitchen. She was sitting at the kitchen table, I was across the room by the sink and the block of knives, my dad (who had been present but otally uninvolved since I came upstairs) was a few feet behind me. I was clearly in a bad way and end up grabbing a meat cleaver out of the knife block and just stood there staring at it and testing the blade for a bit then I audibly slammed my head into the counter, I could see the both of them and neither reacted. I lined the blade up with a gap in my vertebrae and brought it up to hopefully end things cleanly, then my mom yells at me (in case you didn't guess she had been yelling at me the entire time but only now responded to my having a knife) that I had better not come after either of them with it. I started laughing hysterically and put the knife down, I was laughing so hard I couldn't stand up, I was laughing for almost fifteen minutes before I could pull myself together enough to try to explain what was so funny. After I told them my mom insisted that I be held under a suicide watch, I begged them to not make me and that I was fine (I have issues with therapy and psychiatrists, it's part of the long story I left out), eventually they agreed to just keep an eye on me themselves since it was almost four in the morning and I had school.

Recently I started to remember more about that night, not any details about why but about my mom. For some reason whenever I thought back to that night I couldn't remember her face, I couldn't remember what she was feeling. It was just like every other time the she seemed to be mad at me for no reason and I began to get suicidal. It all came back to me, she was happy. She had this smirk on her face until I put the knife to my neck and that fucking smirk turned into a shit eating grin, I have never seen her as genuinely happy as that night and I have never seen her as disappointed as when I put the knife down. She wanted me dead and I've never brought that night up since, I don't plan to. As much as I should I don't plan on cutting her out of my life, I plan on trying to be the best I can be and make the most of my life, I want to see how she responds to my success, my happiness. Even still I love her, despite everything that's happened I can't bring myself to hate her and her ability to make people like her after only meeting her once sickens me, nobody would believe that night ever happened after meeting her."
midgaze,stopdrinking,1391158212.0,"I once decided to stop for 10 years, and made a solemn promise to myself that I would stick to it. I forget how long that one lasted. Probably a couple days. Another time I promised myself that I wouldn't have another drink until I had my life under control and my finances in shape. I don't think that one lasted a week.

Stopping 5 years is as hard as stopping for a lifetime, except that you process each one differently in your mind. 5 years is a big chore with an expiration date. A lifetime is making a new life for yourself. I would suggest that if you fail in this, take a good hard look at what alcohol is to you and decide if you want it in your life anymore. It's a hard process with a lot of different elements to it, but if you are an alcoholic (and from the sound of it, that is pretty likely) the benefits will be pretty awesome."

Look at /r/orangecounty across the top where it says filter. Those links all use the built-in reddit search engine to filter posts. You can do the same in your sidebar, AND it will display the correct amount of links for each flair group.

The ""best of"" post group link in /r/orangecounty goes to a search for

    flair:best

With limit my search to /r/orangecounty checked, and the posts sorted by new.

http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/search?q=flair%3Abest&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on

BonzoTheBoss,todayilearned,1391158688.0,"Thank you for clarifying. I always get uncomfortable as a Brit when discussing our sordid past in case people equate the UK of that time to the UK of today. 

I won't pretend everyone is completely free of prejudice today (it's a running joke to complain about ""immigrants"") but our generation wasn't even alive when all this went on, and these historical facts are as abhorrent to us as they are to everyone else."

&gt; I have a very personal relationship with my lord and savior, Jesus Christ. Very personal.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I met him three years ago at a bar in downtown Reno. I was hanging out with a few of my friends- they were all getting shitfaced, but unfortunately, I was the designated driver. So I was just sitting there sipping on a glass of ice water. Then this Middle Eastern guy takes a seat next to me.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Do you wanna see a really cool trick?"" he asked. I wasn't sure if he was hitting on me or not, but I was bored off my ass, so I said sure. Then he snapped his fingers and my water turned into wine. ""Jesus Christ!"" I said. He grinned and said, ""Yup, that's my name. And if you play your cards right, you'll be screaming it all night long. You want to get into heaven, you sexy little thing? Well, let me put it this way...the only way to The Father is through me.""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not gay, so I was feeling pretty awkward. But after a few shots of some holy spirits, I started to loosen up. And it dawned on me that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I would become the first person in human history to bone Jesus- who could pass that up?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So I abandoned my friends and went back to his place. He lit some candles and put on some Christmas carols to set the mood. After a few glasses of sacramental wine, I was ready to go. I tore his robes off and thrust my manhood inside him. The feeling was incredible- it was like fucking three people at the same time. ""OH, ME!"" he screamed in ecstasy. ""I HAVEN'T BEEN NAILED THIS HARD SINCE THE CRUCIFIXION!""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I blew my load pretty quickly, but he wasn't done with me. He bent me over and whispered, ""Are you ready to accept the body of Christ?"" He didn't even wait for answer- he jammed his divine rod in my asshole and went to town. I was surprised at how fast he came-but then again, he hadn't gotten laid in 2,000 years, so I could see why.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I thought he was finished. He rolled me over on my back and said, ""Are you ready for the Second Coming?"" and sprayed his holy seed all over my face.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I never got his number- he just told me to pray to the heavens if I was ever in the mood for a booty call. Still haven't heard back from him, though.

Was not disappoint."

spongebib,Negareddit,1391158849.0,"Yeah, this question seems to be upvoted to the front page of /r/AskReddit at least a couple of times per month and it's always horribly predictable. It's also typically a total cesspool. You get the same few opinions that aren't at all controversial on reddit (stuff about drugs or piracy or whatever the hot jerk of the moment is) and then you just get a bunch of really sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. crap. It's so annoying. "
Secret_Wizard,AskReddit,1391158871.0,"""All that is gold does not glitter,

A light from the shadows shall spring;  
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,  
The crownless again shall be king.""

BonzoTheBoss,todayilearned,1391159154.0,"The British *government* and elite (which are pretty much the same thing) of the 1840s sucked, definitely.

The British public at home and abroad actually sent hundreds of thousands of pounds to aid in the famine.

Furthermore, the modern British (whose generation was not even alive when this occurred) find these historical facts about the famine, and all the others from our country's sordid past, as abhorrent as you do."

spongebib,openbroke,1391159176.0,"I totally agree. A lot of redditors see themselves as cold, detached, stoic badasses who are above emotions and who are always ""rational"" and ""logical."" They see themselves as ascended individuals, but I do agree that most of them are probably just quite self-centered, immature, and haven't taken the time to really hone their senses of empathy. 

It's always interesting to stumble upon a thread of people trying to compete with one another to see who has the least amount of empathy. I've noticed this happening after pretty much every big tragedy (Sandy Hook shootings, Boston marathon bombings, etc.). "
