But when the time comes I'll talk with them both about how I expect them to respect my rules since she's still my responsibility. My personal opinion is if they can't wait, they're not ready for the responsibility and the risk of potential parenthood. I don't disapprove of birth control but there is always a chance of failure so I believe you can only truly avoid the risk by not engaging in early intercourse. I don't expect them to be able to abide by something I didn't accomplish myself, but since I was able to hold off on sex until my early 20s, I don't think I'm asking for anything unreasonable. Hell if she turns out to be a lesbian then I'll only advise them to be careful about STDs, but i wouldn't object to it otherwise, since the risk of her getting knocked up by another woman is nil.

MidnightSlinks,publichealth,1390352075.0,"Everyone I know working in epidemiology has a PhD and not an MD, but I think it really depends on what you want to do. In the US our outbreaks are reported by normal hospital physicians and then epidemiologists at the state level and/or CDC track the outbreak, create policies to prevent future outbreaks (often in conjunction with state and local health departments), and plan for future emergencies. There are MD's involved, but more in a research role so don't think that an epidemiologist with an MD is going to be seeing many--or possibly any--patients.

I'll also say that the MPH of an MD/MPH is often a 1-year degree and worth far less (intellectually) than a full MPH. It's more of a survey degree at my school since all public health students have to take the intro course in 5 departments, leaving very little room for higher courses once you take into account working on the master's thesis.

I would suggest doing a lot of stats and epidemiology in undergrad. The latter may not be available to you as an undergrad, but a stats background is very helpful. From there, try to shadow some people (state health department), work for epi researchers, and get internships (NIH and CDC both have summer internship programs for undergrads). You may find that you want to get a PhD in epidemiology instead of go to medical school and I would encourage you to be open to that. I can't count how many people I know getting PhD's who ""wanted to go to med school"" when they were freshmen and realized there was more out there than they knew."

The summer after my freshman year of college was a little bit rowdy as it was my first time living truly unsupervised in an apartment in the city.  We had no air conditioning and in Boston it gets not only hot but humid as *fuck* in the summer so I took to wearing as few clothes as possible when I knew I was home alone- this comes into play later.

So I had been 'partying' (and I use this term in quotes because it has less to do with partying and more to do with staying awake for days on end completing pieces for my summer courses) a bit hard and I found myself rather strung out one morning- or afternoon, I'm not sure.  I had been laying in bed praying for the sweet release of death or the Air Conditioning fairy but neither came.  No one was home and I stumbled, naked, to the bathroom to puke.  On hands and knees I was heaving and dry heaving and all that jazz and things were *rough*, like really rough.  

Now this was a small bathroom and my ass couldn't have been more than 4 inches from the wall behind me but I was heaving and heaving and I heaved so hard that I *projectile period-ed onto the wall behind me*.

I am not swatting the action aside, saying it's perfectly acceptable. The man was being selfish to himself and his friends, disregarding other people. This happens to everyone. Everyone thinks about themselves, and regularly you have people saying and doing things that involve you, but you are not regarded at all, physically or emotionally. You do this to others as well, saying and doing things that only favour you.

I just don't see the row-of-butts-slap exceeding that, and becoming a sexual issue or gender targeted harassment. Trying to find the easy answer by saying it's somehow assaulting women would undermine the meaning of assaulting."
sworebytheprecious,TheBluePill,1390352451.0,"TRP would hate it, but not for the reasons they think. see, i have this theory: red pill women really, REALLY hate men. it is the closest to actual misandry you will ever see. and red pill women hate TRP men so very much that the only possible way they can reconcile it is to become it. sorta like firefly and the reavers.

now, being the cock hungry beta baiter that i am, i will never hate men (or women for that matter) like they do because i have standards for both genders that ensure i have a pretty good time treating people as people and it's worked for me so far. but red pill women seem to have shoe-horned themselves into a world view where the only companionship they can hope to obtain should and will be: negative, destructive, unsupportive, AGGRESSIVELY anti-intellectual,  and weirdly reminiscent of a twighlight level romance wherein they can play the mary sue and get their very own darkly twisted fetish bad boy.
which is where things fall apart, and why red pill women cannot use red pill tactics themselves.

as a TRP man both hates and fetishizes women, he must also play a mary sue role. in this case, that of the bad boy fetish object so both terms are met. if either on of them fails to play their roles, the script doesn't work anymore and falls apart into something else completely. a TRP man would never, ever allow himself to play the feminized fetish object because that is not how the roles are played: they both HATE each other but they must at all costs aquire the fetish object. and the only way to do that, in their worlds, is to play the game.

My mother has always had problems with things that are affected by magnetic fields. She apparently has a very strong biomagnetic field -- to the point where over six months to a year she will magnetize a mechanical watch, and it will cease to function. When a watchmaker opens the back, the parts will pop out and go everywhere. 

She worked as a summer intern in college for Allied Van Lines, which at the time had the large disk drive units mentioned in the second post. She would bring in a large printout and start working through problems she had found, using the disk drive tops as a convenient surface on which to spread out 14"" green/white fan-fold paper. Almost immediately after she leaned up against one of the drives, bells would go off as the entire system crashed due to I/O errors on the disks. It only happened when *she* leaned up against one of the disks. 

After a half dozen crashes or so and then an actual test during a maintenance downtime with DEC engineers on hand, she was banned from the computer room and the crashes stopped. She had to ring a bell and wait for the computer programmers or technicians to come out to talk to her.

Years later (in the late 90s -- we were very much early technology adopters) we couldn't figure out why Win9x PCs always crashed around my mother, usually in odd, unrecoverable ways that couldn't be replicated. It didn't help that Mom was at the bottom of the chain for hand-me-down hardware. (Dad always bought the latest toys, I inherited his and added go-fast parts, and my sister didn't care what she had as long as it fit in her Hello Kitty case.) Then, remembering the story, Dad got extension cables for her VGA monitor PS/2 keyboard and mouse, and put the CPU case in another room. Random crashes ceased. 

These days, she doesn't seem to have a problem with laptops or iPads, although she did have a serious problems with Android-based phones after her trusty old Razr flip phone died. An iPhone works, though. Guess things have finally gotten durable enough or small enough that a random weak magnetic field won't flip as many bits. "

msbubbles326,Dogtraining,1390353054.0,"I'm not an expert, I've only had one dog, but here is my experience:

My dog is about to be seven years old (tomorrow!) and he has mostly free roam of apartment (formally a house) when we're not home. When I first got him and we were in a house, we blocked off the kitchen and tested the free roaming theory for a couple hours. Did this a few times, all was well, let him have the dining room too, and for longer hours. No issues, more freedom.

Though I hate to leave my boy alone too long, it happens because my husband and I work full time. Jake (my boy) always had free roam of the house and accidents were rarely an issue. They happen, but not often. Same story with our apartment. We close our bedroom door and bathroom door, but only because we know Jake will get into the garbage and he has a particular fondness for used tissues (I have a special boy).

When we first moved, we started off leaving him for a couple of hours, and he was fine with it. We discovered if we left the blind up it calmed him down. He would bark a little bit otherwise. It didn't take long for him to be fine all day long, though he was used to being alone. Just recently we discovered he doesn't care about the blind being up anymore either. He seems perfectly content to just chill all day and not be bothered. 

For reference, since this might be helpful, Jake is a Brussels Griffon. Smaller dog, very clingy, very stubborn, but totally cool to have run of the house. He has a bed in the living room and we let him sleep in the couch too. He also has access to the guest bed, which he seems to have claimed as his own. His toys are scattered about and he does entertain himself.

Though it certainly does depend on the individual dog, it is possible you could let your little guy run free. If all goes well, it may only take a week or so before he's ready to run the house. If you start off with a small space for a short amount of time and gradually increase both you'll know if this is a reasonable option for you.

Best of luck, and Happy Birthday to your little buddy!"

If a guy gives me lots of very consistent romantic attention but I don't know him very well, I will probably be put off. I have a hard time believing that someone is really interested in me if he doesn't know me very well, and it will change my opinion of him.

If a guy gives me intermittent romantic attention, I will probably think that he pursues lots of women this way, like putting out ""feelers"" to see if anyone ""bites,"" and I won't feel very special or interested. 

I like it if a guy takes some time to get to know me one-on-one, and then gives me consistent attention (long, thoughtful responses to texts, flirting, etc.)

Man if only I could turn someone vanilla into the DOM/TOP of my dreams. I suppose it has its uses but honestly if you're not naturally inclined in that direction it just doesn't work for me. Even though being pushed against a wall by the last guy I was seeing was hot it wasn't DOM hot. If anything I ended up being in control there.

I've run into this same issue in Texas. I had an impossible time getting someone to come drywall a 5x10' bathroom. With only ten sheets needing to be hung, it was too small to attract anyone, since most drywall laborers get paid by the sheet. Since there's certain things I can't do (and drywall is one that I *won't* do -- it's easy, but it sucks), I ended up eventually finding people who were willing to do jobs if I paid them hourly. 

Do the homework and take the tests. I realize that it's difficult to read the code books, but they can be distilled down pretty quickly by someone with a bit of experience. Your city building department *might* (city building departments vary -- mine is extraordinarily helpful about anything that I do, and we trade advice and tips, materials, sources for materials, etc. I realize that not everyone is lucky like me.) have a good line on summaries or study guides for the test. 

On top of that, with the age of your house, you're going to end up having to bring a lot of things up to date. It's not just going to be cabinets and stuff, and you might end up realizing that it's going to be faster to just take everything (drywall, plaster, lathe, etc.) down to the studs, re-insulating from the envelope out, and putting modern and safe materials in.

If things start with *me taking the lead* it's a hell of a time for any guy to get that back from me.

Renner1,syriancivilwar,1390354533.0,"&gt; Islam is not a race. It is a religion, and in the holy book of that religion it dictates how a state should be run. 

And I'm talking about the self-styled ""critics"" of Islam in Europe, who do little more the continuously spout ""Islam is an evil ideology and everyone who subscribes in any way to evil Islam is as bad as Bin Laden or the Taliban"".

I'm not claiming that takfirism or radicalism isn't an issue. I'm not claiming that people who want to run society on some strict Quranic basis are reasonable or rational or decent people-- I would say I'm much more virulent in regard to actual instances of Salafi Jihadism or takfirism or whatever appearing.

&gt; If you think this does not clash with the idea of secularism, I don't know what does. 

Yes, Quranic literalism does clash with the concept of secular society, as does any form of religious fundamentalism. That's one of the reasons the very conservative Islamists are doomed to failure in regard to trying to create a viable society based around strictest implementation of religious law and otherwise having everything based off of quranic literalism.

&gt; I think you need to reevaluate your radical contempt for those who simply see an issue you fail to perceive.

No, I will always have contempt for those people who say outright ""Islam is monolithic"" or ""Islam is a threat to the west"" or ""people from Muslim countries hate secularism and love fanaticism"".

Statements like these, and others, do absolutely nothing to solve the issue of takfirism or Salafi Jihadism or other manifestations of violent extremism. Furthermore, the people who spout the above sorts of statements have no solution apart from ""deport every Muslim from anywhere of any variety from Europe and the West, because they're all evil, we're at war with evil Islam and anyone associated with it"".

Stupid, delusional, counterproductive thinking, and the people who espouse these sorts of beliefs are hugely and unashamedly racist. I mean actually racist, by the regular definition of the word.

Are you following me so far?

&gt; who see Islam as a threat. It is a threat,

Takfirism is a threat. Wahhabism is a threat. Salafi Jihadism is a threat. Conservative or ultra-conservative Islamism is a threat. 

Primarily to people in the Muslim world, who primarily are different variations of Muslims, of course in the most heterogeneous sense of that particular identity. 

Islam, unless it manifests itself in away that is inherently negative or threatening, is not a threat. Are the people who are in pro-secularist groups and in favour of increased secularization in a changing Egypt a threat because the majority of them are Muslims (anti Islamist, pro-secular government Muslims)?

I could go on and on about this. 

&gt; and accusing those who talk about it as being racist is dangerous, its the suppression of thought and opinions through social intimidation.

If someone wants to bring up the issues surrounding a takfiri bastard like Anjem Chaudary in the UK, and the negative things he and the people who subscribe to his way of thinking, without saying that Chaudary somehow is the primary representative of South Asians or South Asian Muslims in Britain, then by all means they should talk about his malignancy. Chaudary is very malignant, and no one can deny that. 

But to say ""Chaudary represents the Bengalis and the Pakistanis and the Indians, and they love him and subscribe to his worldview"" is the worst sort of lying, disingenuous garbage-- and it's something actively pushed by people who'll see no difference between ""takfiri"" and ""Muslim"", and who will act atrociously on a racial basis.

And it's not just the home console market; the 3DS also had a really bad start, and even this year it did not sell as much as they projected. The handheld market faces much different problems than the home console market, of course, but since the handheld market really was Nintendo's crutch through the lackluster console years it is a big deal that it is starting to lag now.

As a sidenote, I say that Nintendo hasn't been first in a generation since SNES, but please don't conflate that to mean I don't like the N64 or Gamecube. I loved them both, but there's no denying that they did not do as well as their competitors."

I suppose the first thing one ought to consider no matter what is fit. No matter what it is that you end up wearing, it should fit you.

Avistew,polyamory,1390354971.0,"The reasons are pretty much the same as any relationship, but since you specified you were interested in the process, I guess I'll talk about how it went when I broke up with my ex.

Really the main thing was how it affected my other partner. We almost ended up breaking up too (he broke up with me briefly, then we decided to give it a try and stay together. In the end we're still together now, 3 years later).

While he wanted to be supportive of me, his partner, he also felt close to his metamour as they had become friends, and did not know where his place was. He also worried a bit (""If you left him, how do I know you're not going to leave me, too?"").

My ex also reacted strongly towards his metamour. A bit after a break-up, he sent him a message that was pretty aggressive about how a real friend would had been there for him and such things.

That's just the beginning though. Afterwards, there was a lot of drama linked to getting my things (I used to live with my ex, moved with my current partner) among other things, and me returning a ring he had given me that was his family's ring, which I wanted to return, but figured I'd return once I had my stuff back (since he promised to return my stuff long before I found the ring again... long story, it had been lost a few years earlier and we both thought it gone for good).

As a result of that drama, my current partner pretty much hates his ex-metamour now, because he feels my ex treated me like a piece of shit, had no decency, and proved to be a terrible person when push came to shove.

So, I guess a big difference is what can happen with the metamours. (Note that they did not know each other before dating me, so it's not like they were friends before and it destroyed their friendship. They grew closer while both dating me, though)."

Those who stayed toward the bottom of earned income tended to be more socially aware which included being feminists.

Willravel,Cooking,1390355667.0,"Wow, that sounds amazing! Venison is lean game meat, meaning you have to treat it differently than things like beef, which tends to be quite fatty (unless you're buying grass-fed). 

The venison tenderloin is one of my favorite cuts of any meat. It has the juicy tenderness of beef tenderloin, but it has a lot more flavor. You can cut it into medallions and cook it in olive oil with a little rosemary. They take very little time, and they taste unbelievable. You can also make venison Wellington, which is probably how I'd prepare it given the opportunity. For this, seer the loin in a little olive oil, salt, and pepper, then make the duxelles of your choice. For beef Wellington I use Parma ham, but for venison it's better to use prosciutto. Lay out the prosciutto with the duxelles on it and wrap up the venison. Take that and wrap it up inside puff pastry (store bought is fine). A little egg wash on top is fine. ~40 minutes at 425 should be more than enough. 

Venison shoulder or leg can be made into some of the best chili in the world, especially if you use the slow-cooker to really break down the connective tissue. [Emeril's recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/venison-chili-recipe/index.html) works great, but the 35-45 minute thing is nonsense. Venison is the meat of a wild animal, not something that's been unmoving inside a cage. It requires a little extra work. 

That should get you started. I've got a lot more if you want. I've recently (over the winter) started experimenting with combining venison with sweet flavors, particularly apple and apple-related spices, with some surprising results. Onions, apples, and venison are amazing. "

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1390355978.0,"A lot more than manual labor is getting made redundant. Diagnostic physicians seem to me likely candidates based on the work being done with the Watson technology. It will be difficult for any physician to compete with an AI capable of accessing such a broad set of data on which to determine probabilities of a diagnosis. Robot assisted surgery continues to advance as well.

Law is another common high skill profession that relies largely on the ability to reference case law. Apply a similar technique as Watson to that area of knowledge and parts of that professional support structure starts to become redundant.

Global classrooms where a single University lecture can serve the needs of millions at once and for years to come seem to me likely to become the norm. The cost of higher education has gotten out of control. Debt of students has become a generational burden. There's already a movement in this direction with some classes reaching thousands of students world wide. I can see within a generation or two globally university systems collapse as the efficiency of global classroom initiatives take over. This could reach down to elementary schools with things like Khan academy relieving local budgets, putting bus drivers out of work, shifting teachers to tutors and reducing the need for on site facilities.

Currently in the US the entire tax preparation industry is supported by a congress forbidding the IRS from allowing direct and automated filing. Add on to that line of work accounting roles that are relatively easy to automate along with a UBI world of simplified tax codes and we've got a recipe to wipe out many more skilled and unskilled jobs.

Financial services in a lot of ways are the same kind of thing. It's just people chasing money with high skills, but they're fundamentally redundant roles to society in large part. We've been automating away trading activity for some time. Not only don't we really need people doing a lot of those things, but we're automating a lot of what's done away.

Even entertainment is becoming more globalized. We have a large appetite, but with global time shifted viewing a single production can satisfy many orders of magnitude more demand than in decades past. I mean I've got a few thousand hours of content I've never seen before sitting in my netflix queue already. 

I doubt the 2 decade timeline, but over the long run most of what we're currently doing is a candidate for being made redundant or superfluous activity."

They have been upgraded continuously, and I would imagine that said process will continue. It is hard to imagine any new tanks replacing these designs anytime soon. Of course, there are always new tanks coming out, especially in the developing world, but most of these designs are behind or on par with tanks like the Leopard 2."

Tethering a dog can really cause problems and you can't rely on a dog to respect invisible boundaries (allowing it to be loose is really not an option). You should get the yard fenced-in. Most rescues will actually not allow you to adopt a dog if there is no fence, wooden or invisible. It's best to go with wooden as invisible fences can cause a lot of mental distress in dogs as well. That's a problem you need to address first.

That being said, in my opinion you should go with the second choice. You can get the first one but it would probably require you to exercise more and will need much more attention for the next year or so. 1 year old is still a puppy. I think you'd have an easier time with the more laidback one, especially as a first-time dog. Though you have to consider their compatibility with other dogs and cats, their grooming needs, other factors that you should find out and think about."

RichAfterTaxes,gamecollecting,1390357295.0,"Ha! The Animal Crossing 3DS really does resemble a Pop-Tart. Nice observation. 

I feel like LE systems particularly start to go down when: A) A similar design is used for a newer LE, B) When a new model of the system (or a successor) is released, or C) Well, a good amount of time goes by. For instance, all of these factors definitely hurt the Triforce DS Lite. I doubt Nintendo's going to release another Animal Crossing-themed system any time soon, so it should hold its value a little better; but I expect it to be one of those LE systems that commands a slight premium (like, $20) in the long run, but not much. Kind of like the Gold N64. 

Pokemon systems are the trickiest to predict. More than pretty much any other fanbase, PKMN fans tend to be very willing to make it rain in order to get what they want. Thus, some systems - like the Pikachu N64 and Pikachu SP - still demand solid premiums even years later. But then there are systems like the Pokemon GBCs that aren't terribly pricey. It's hard to say what will happen to the Pikachu XL - it's obviously not going to stay at the insane current levels forever, but its fall could be a very small one, a big one or anywhere in between.

wdn,Celiac,1390358339.0,"Long story short: traditionally, oats have been not allowed in a gluten-free diet for celiacs. Now it's starting to look like this was only because oats are almost always contaminated by wheat. The reasons for this include the way that crops are rotated -- the wheat is mixed in with the oats before they're even harvested, so having oats with no wheat requires a non-traditional approach to growing oats. Products labeled as ""gluten-free oats"" are grown such that they are not contaminated with wheat -- but I don't know to what degree anyone is held accountable on this claim.

The hospital where my family gets their advice says that you can eat product labeled ""gluten-free oats"" if you find that you tolerate it."

i don't really give a shit about karma. what i do care about is rules being enforced evenly because otherwise, it's unfair for the majority of people in this subreddit. i ask for product lists because i'm curious about the products being used, as i'm sure others are too. that's why they're required, after all. i ask if a photo is filtered because i want to know if what i'm looking at is the actual hue of a lipstick or if it's totally different in real life. i'm sure other people want to know this as well, which is why filters and photoshop are discouraged in this subreddit.

the mods don't seem to enforce either of these rules, and in any case, that's not what i'm trying to do. i'm not trying to reward and punish; i'm trying to raise awareness. many, many newcomers post a filtered photo of their face sans a product list and then simply get downvoted without an explanation. that's not helpful! when i comment and remind them to check the sidebar, they learn something new about post requirements here and hopefully prevent themselves from getting downvoted to oblivion in the future. i'm not nasty about it; i don't ask for ""product list or gtfo"". i don't know where you're getting this stuff about me thinking i'm a mod or whatever. i only make those comments occasionally, when i notice them.

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1390359126.0,"10 = 2^(1)5^(1) and 100 = 2^(2)5^(2)

So a, b, and c are all of the form 2^(r)5^(s) where 1 &lt;= r, s &lt;= 2.

Since lcm=100, then at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 4 and at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 25.

Since gcd=10, then at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 2 but not 4, and at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 5 but not 25.

We may assume, WLOG, that a &lt;= b &lt;= c

Possible triples:
If a = b = 10, then c = 100.
If a = 10 and b = 20, then c = 50 or 100.
If a = 10 and b = 50, then c = 100.
If a = b = 20, then c = 50.
If a = 20 and b = 50, then c = 50 or 100.

These then are the possible triples: {(10, 10, 100), (10, 20, 50), (10, 20, 100), (10, 50, 100), (20, 20, 50), (20, 50, 50), (20, 50, 100)}"

Alright so TMI answers for TMI questions:  I have what I like to call pH imbalance ""issues"" (oh the joys of aging) and I've been living in dread of having it really flare up right now.  But 2 months?  You've got to get that handled.  My tips are to chug water like there's no tomorrow and wash at least daily (adding an extra rinse in the morning/evening can be good as long as you're not drying yourself out with it).  Use soap on your tush but don't use soaps or other products on your nethers.  If you've got one use a handheld shower head to make sure you're rinsing your undercarriage thoroughly.  Make sure you're wearing good breathable cotton (ALL cotton, not just cotton lined) undies, consider taking a break from thongs if you normally wear them and get some extra sleep.  I also use a topical cream for some mild relief too but mostly I've just got used to pampering myself until it passes and being extra careful to avoid potential irritants (like those which come from your tush and migrate forward either from sweaty crack or the delightful shiftying of a thong).  Also if you're able/up to it, try to uh, ""double click your mouse"" now and then to keep the fluids moving down there, if you know what I mean.  Sex can be an irritant too but a solo round just helps flush things out."

Nintendo has not even acknowledged the ""Fusion,"" much less acknowledged they're working on a new console.

Here's the trick people don't know about console development: it takes a lot of time. Once the Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii were finished, those teams broke up and the core groups immediately began working on the next generation's consoles. In other words, Nintendo is one year into development of a console that would theoretically be released in 2018, and those specifications on Nintendo News look feasible for a $200 - $300 machine manufactured for sale in the later half of this decade.

Later, you learn about formulas, which are basically more comes rules that apply the same way arithmetic does.

LOL *well* that was going to be my ""secret"" to why I think it works for me, so I suppose we proved each other wrong? I, too, have thick and coarse eyelashes, but I don't have the clumping issue.

I do use very little of it though. I just pull the wand out and apply to each eye. I never have to dip again. I do follow up with an old brush of theirs that is dry and I use that just to comb things out. However, I'm doing that because it really adds a fineness and lengthens the lashes, not so much for clumping.

I suppose it's just 'to each their own', because everyone I grew up with *loves* that greatest lash mascara by CoverGirl (the pink and green tube one) and that one just clumps and kills my lashes. I'd watch it work wonders on my friend's lashes when we'd preen before going out and it just created black sludge on my own lol"

I'm not in BC but from their website I noticed that they are part of the [HealthLink](http://www.healthlinkbc.ca/index.html) network.  We have the same kind of service and I find that as a result of the consolidated HealthLink service, the individual hospitals are less equipped to handle general inquiries.  I suspect that is why you got transferred around so much, basically answering your questions is a customer service that none of those people are really intended to provide.  That's what their prenatal classes are for.  As rude as the last person sounded, you may very well have at that point been transferred to a busy nurses station and she's got legitimately pressing issues in the hospital that required her attention.  That doesn't mean you're going to have issues with quality of care in the facility, but it is super frustrating.

If you're unabel to attend their prenatal classes and you've exhausted their website's resources for [having a baby](http://www.bcwomens.ca/HealthTopics/HavingBaby/default.htm), try HealthLink (just dial 811), and if you're still unable to get answers to your questions there is an email address(prenatalinfo@cw.bc.ca) for the hospital's Childbirth Education Program, you may have more success sending in a list of questions than trying to get someone on the phone.

ThatCrankyGuy,learnprogramming,1390360688.0,"This is the most accurate answer here, with regards to the actual question.

To add to this, there are space boundaries, where the calling conventions actually apply in this context. These spaces exists between various levels of abstractions, such as your python program, python libraries, wrappers, VM, native layer and so on.

When you execute your python program, python loader launches and loads all native dependencies into memory - the really low level stuff that communicates with the OS (IO, threading, etc), natively compiled libraries and the VM. These exchange address mapping amongst each other using those calling conventions spoken of earlier. Inside the VM a scope lookup table is constructed and security acl applied to it (sand boxing) (Sometimes sandboxing can be outside the VM as double layer security), and to that scope table the available functions list are added. So for example, the VM now knows what address to jump to and what to push onto the stack (as parameter) before jumping there, when say a list sort is asked for. Internally the VM is already keeping your variables in a mutually exchangeable unit such as a data type struct. Your list was already an array unit called a PyListObject which just got it's pointer sent to the native library for sorting."

Why does compression do so? 

For example, let's say I work my quads heavily during my workout. Muscle fibers are ""damaged"" and need to rebuild, multiply, etc. They do so from proteins/nutrients delivered via blood (I realize I don't have the specifics correct, but this is my general understanding). Why would compressing the arteries/arterioles/capillaries/veins in the leg facilitate this process? Adding pressure to the system (let's just go with the thigh as a system) will compress the methods of delivery. I understand that blood will pass through a compressed channel QUICKER, but it seems to me that it's at the loss of VOLUME of blood. See; kinking a hose. 

Light muscle stimulation post-exercise makes sense because it increases the volume of nutrient-carrying blood that passes through the system while not causing more stress and breakdown of the muscle, but laying down in bed with compression tights on - how is increased healing going on? Have I simplified the question by just focusing on the circulatory system?

Enjoy spending a month or so on plate tectonics.

A single point in time is useful - you can write a story or play a game. Extrapolating millennia sucks. You get bogged down in determinism and teleology just to get anything done... a single point in time, you get get endless detail and make something beautiful and subtle, with meaning.

Not to say planetary geology can't be beautiful, but it's not usually the point of worldbuilding, which is more a means to an end.

In my biggest project, which is waiting until I'm a bit more established as a writer, I have *tens of millions* of years of history. That being said, a lot of it is empty - there's two separate apocalypses and two four eras of nothing extraordinary happening (archaen, pre-sapience, post-apocalypse 1, post-apocalypse 2) with three eras of sapient races, during one which my main plot happens.

That being said, just the central characters for my narrative number in the dozens, not counting lots of main characters who will need developing to move the story along.

As such, I have one just map, didn't do any tectonics, just barely did the weather, and it's still getting way up there in pages, and I haven't written any of the actual books I want to write...

A lincoln is about the height of a roll of pennies, with Lincoln's picture on it them, so it's easy enough for us dumb Americans to remember.

With the stress of a new job and long hours I wasn't working out and losing weight, but simply maintaining. Had I lost more weight, I could have just had the dress taken in no problem anyway. Since I didn't lose the extra weight, I just ended up with a dress that fit perfect and only had to be hemmed for my September wedding.

But it can also be something wonderful.  

You give away a piece of yourself everytime you have sex in the same way that you give a piece of yourself everytime you smile at someone or make a friend.  Everytime you devote yourself to a cause and every time you have faith in anyone or anything.  Being generous with yourself is not a bad thing, you are ever-replenishing.

Sex is not enough to hold a relationship together, and for most couples in long term relationships the sex dies off much sooner than the friendship and it becomes work to bring the intimacy back.  Doesn't sound quite like the wonderdrug your parents are telling you now does it?

Be afraid of sex because it is an important choice to make as a mature adult to be responsible with your sexual activity, and failing to be responsible can have life altering consequences.

But don't be afraid of sex because it will tie you to someone.  If you have an SO for several years it will feel impossible to move on whether you've had sex or not.  It will hurt like your soul is being torn apart.  But you'll heal, you'll grow, and you'll become more because just as you've been sharing yourself with others, they've been sharing themselves with you.

While I disagree with /u/Knuckldragger about soccer,  frenchmen and their regard of muscles, he does make a point about you making up excuses not to workout hard and improve your body.  Do you know how hard it is to get injured if you lift correctly and with the right weights?

Do you even understand that we cannot, for our lives, think of any kind of education that would require you to be a  wire of a man?

I'm 22 years old.  I'm an Aerospace Engineering and Astrophysics double Major, I spend my time reading, lifting, writing and in the bloody workshop for my EV racing team, which requires a certain level of deftness not to spoil valuable pieces of equipment, that sometimes have to be made from scratch.  I have had to develop superhuman time management skills, but I have made it.  My grades have not suffered by it, either.

I'm also bodybuilder and I train as much as I can because I love my body.  Every time I try to push my limits and get **dem gainz** because I know I can always be better.  My Bench is 245lb=111kg (I'm 5'10"") and the only injuries I have ever gotten are from overworking my legs.

So far you only seem to try and talk yourself out of actually going for it on the gym.  Get out of your comfort zone, it just feels so good when you finally do it.  

Don't shoot down people for calling you out on this, because it just makes you come out as a guy that cannot take criticism and is just looking for someone to validate his grim and immature outlook on his own life.

Our front porch was built incorrectly, so the center of the stoop is a little caved it. When it rains, it makes puddle. There is about 3 feet of space on the edges of the stoop, all the way around, that are normal, flat pavement. Just the little dip in the center.

Two summers ago, we had days of rain in the Midwest. Literally days. It was annoying. During this time, I was expecting an important package. I was moving to China for a year, and I was waiting for my visa paperwork; my school took their time sending their verification to the Chinese government, so it was less than two weeks until I flew to Beijing and I still had no visa.

Enter: UPS.

The UPS guy left my package, right in the center of the puddle on our stoop. I mean, it was one of those reinforced envelope packages; clearly flat, clearly papers. He just threw it into this days-old puddle and drove the fuck away. So my Chinese visa, crucial for a trip I departed for in 10 days, and **my passport** sat in this puddle for two hours while I was still at work.

I about lost my shit. The ink spread, and I was really worried that it had made the Chinese characters illegible. I called, and I got the run-around. How could I prove, without a doubt, that it was intentional? It's been raining. There was *clearly* plenty of space that wasn't in the puddle. The delivery person either actively chose to put it there, or threw it there and left it after seeing it partially submerged in water.

Pyro62S,asoiaf,1390363027.0,"Ser Barristan says something to this effect in A Dance with Dragons that Aerys took ""certain liberties"" during the bedding ceremony. I have no idea what that means, but it could imply a first right sort of deal. It's questionable how much other people were aware of this if it's true. Genna may not have actually known. I tend to think her statement about Tyrion was just about Tyrion being the most like Tywin in wit and temperament. If she was unknowingly telling the truth about Tywin's offspring, you should add dramatic irony to that list as well.

What I like about this theory the most is the irony that Tywin wanted to protect his family at all costs, which he thought his father had failed to do, but instead ostracized his only true child into killing him personally while raising Aerys' children to great heights. It's incredibly tragic, to the point that I basically accept it as being too perfect in a literary sense not to be true."

To add to his luck, this took place not 50 feet away from where the squadron of archers was stationed on the wall. A volley was launched at me just as the Minotaur attempted his infamous spine-shattering body slam. 

No high level magics left to turn to; the fight had really drained the gnome of his spells. So what does he turn to? Gust Of Wind. The already airborne Minotaur gets launched and not only takes every arrow that was going for me, but crashes into the archers as well.

DukeCanada,AskMen,1390364152.0,"It means taking a chance despite every bone in your body telling you otherwise. Eventually you'll encounter less resistance as you normalize the behavior, which in this case is approaching women. You just need to trust that eventually you're going to get good at this, but that's not going to happen unless you try. 

You're never going be 100% sure of yourself, there's always a pang of ""should I do this"" at the back of your mind. Still, think about this way. If you don't try to approach that cute girl, you're never going to go out with her. However, if you approach her then you have a shot at going out with her. 

That's what I did last week at a show, and I managed to get a date with a a really attractive, intelligent woman. I'm not great with women, I can't seduce girls on the fly. I'm just a regular guy who's not afraid to approach and take a shot. The end result is that I do alright.

Seriously though, Christ. Often when I bring up liking it I get downvoted to Hell. 

Thinking back, sure it wasn't perfect few games are. The homestead shit was confusing and had was time/mission sensitive. I mostly ignored that stuff though. I didn't have a problem with the Desmond missions, they were an enjoyable change of pace. I disliked walking around that stupid fucking cave though. The ending sucked too, but I can overlook that. The only *real* problem I had with the game was how I couldn't get 100% at the part where you're supposed to save Washington. It was glitched to where you couldn't reach him before he got hit. I'm pretty sure it got patched though. 

It was a pretty solid game. In introduced a game mechanic that people liked so much it spawned another freaking game. Which now that I think about it, how do people hate the game but love the naval stuff? That's weird. 

I haven't played Black Flag all of the way through but so far I think it is not as good as 3. There is too much naval stuff, it's barely an Assassin's Creed game. Also the fact that enemies don't engage after I've killed a few of them off is annoying. Sure, the endless spawning was a bit ridiculous in previous games but that happened occasionally and I prefer it to fighting 3 enemies at a time in Black Flag before my notoriety level resets.

And then people complain about Connor. I hear ""He's not a true assassin."" Which really doesn't make sense to me. I feel the story adequately explains everything so that it is cohesive enough into the Assassin Creed mythos."

1 drink, you're obligated to stay for the duration of the drink and converse.
2 drinks, I should be entitled to a kiss.
3 drinks, let's go to the car and make out, possibly with wandering hands.
4+ drinks, just go back to his place and bang already.

When she asked for the second drink, I asked her if I was going to get a kiss. She got pissed even though I was trying to be playful about it. She ended being a crazy bitch and I left her at the next bar we went to when she started hitting on some other dude.

As another response said, tests are just a starting point and are pretty unreliable. If you have a lot of time, you can read up on all the functions and all the different types but usually the test helps you narrow it down to a type you should read up on. You're whatever type you say you are basically. Not everyone can be divided into the 16 categories perfectly (I am on the border between INFJ/INFP but this is because I have worked on being more flexible in situations.) Everyone is unique so I don't think people should take the test or MBTI so seriously. It's just an aid to help you learn about yourself and others. It is by no means as rigid as people seem to think it is.

And it's a particularly useful aid for people like INFJs who have never known anyone like themselves. We exist, and we're here for each other, and we see and process the world similarly, but we don't have the same backgrounds or preferences so it's a good discussion environment."

For the people with HIV, I'm absolutely sympathetic to the idea of wanting to try anything that might prolong their life and give them a better quality of life.  I would probably be buying experimental drugs from Mexico as well if I were in that situation.  I can also understand why the FDA wouldn't want a ton of unapproved drugs being sold.  It's a situation that would very easily attract scammers (""hey, this is a new HIV drug in Germany.  It doesn't have any side effects.  It's $1000 for a month's supply.  It's called Obecalp""....which is 'Placebo' backwards, btw).

Overall, I liked the movie's very accurate portrayal of the early days of HIV/AIDS.  My dad was a medical resident in the 80s and told me about how grim the field was then.  There was literally nothing they could do.  It was desperate times for the patients.

It's essentially like using WebMD to diagnose yourself instead of actually going to a doctor.

People have no problem going to a doctor and for the most part trusting his advice. But people seem to think in lieu of going to a mechanic who actually knows what he's talking about the same way a doctor knows what he's talking about, people just rely on the internet.

There's a lot of good mechanics on the internet, but a lot of good mechanics out there don't have the time or inclination to hand out free information. Whether it's shop walk-ins or on the internet.

Shh...don't tell anyone.

but yeah, that video can get you started. Personally, I like the mid-far view for jet. You need to learn to fly slow and have the right angle of approach. It's much harder in the city, than in the country, mainly because of poles. Locking on with missiles should only ever be for other aircraft, police, or if can accurately drop missiles on ground targets (this is pretty hard but is very satisfying).

Learning to strafe ground targets with guns is much more satisfying, however. I rarely grief folks, but if people get together and are just killing one another i usually make a pass or two and once shot at, try to identify and light em up.

I love firefights at the alamos airports cause Jets control the air. 

Also, if I see another jet, I kill em outright if I can. Sucks cause sometimes they may wanna be friendly but I don't wanna waste my jet, probably as much as they don't wana waste their's. 

edit: just the other a day a guy in an Annhilator helo took me down while I was in Jet. I was PISSED. My SO had just come to bother me with our infant's diaper which she was more than capable of handling. I felt super lame telling her this asshole helo thinks he's rad cause he strafed me with fire on my first pass and while she was (rightly so) chastising my on the lack of merit in my argument he blew me to shit.

Take care of your jet. Black smoke from your tail means you **will** lose power and crash eventually. If you're not actively fucking with people, lose that jet and get another. Make sure your parachuting is on point cause it is definitely possible to get multiple jets back to back to back and so on if you know what you're doing at the fort.

When I see helicopters that aren't dangerous flying around I leave em alone, or I fly I real slow near em, lock on real quick (so they're aware and respect your presence) and escort em around. Although 50% of the time you'll see the player bail from said aircraft... I always feel bad when that happens.

CrazyPlato,AskMen,1390367406.0,"Theory 1: most redditors are so detached when it comes to sex because they haven't had sex

Theory 2: Giving advice is typically an external thing, which contradicts how counseled feels from an internal perspective (saying ""just ask her out"" when in reality it's much harder). The internet creates further distance because we have no way to personally connect with the person we give advice to. We're pretty much giving advice like the answer to a test, because to us the person we're giving it to is our computer, with no personal connection.

There's more that adds to this disconnect. Remember that most people are going to drop details when they describe their situation. This vagueness makes it harder to connect personally, and so we feel more comfortable with giving only vague advice, which tends to be those platitudes you describe.

So in summary, redditors don't get to see the face on the other side of their computer screen, so they talk like they would to their computer: straight facts, no appeal to emotion, no ""reality checks"", and without a lot of detail from the original asker no specificity in the advice."

If you want to look at their other stuff, we have comedies like Nichijou and Lucky Star, and then various slice-of-life and/or rom coms like Hyouka, K-On!, Chuunibyou, and Tamako Market.

KnK certainly has *many* similarities with that latter category, but so does Free! The only unusual things about Free! is that it was a sports anime (though it was far more slice-of-life than most sports anime) and that it had a mostly male cast. On the other hand, KnK differed itself from the other KyoAni slice-of-life series by having a supernatural element. So I don't get what makes Free! more unique than KnK.

&gt; Welcome to /r/AskCulinary where we provide expert guidance for your specific cooking problems to help people of all skill levels become better cooks, to increase understanding of cooking, and to share valuable culinary knowledge.

It's just my personal opinion, I don't think the harsh language is necessary. According to that welcome message, this community welcomes **people of all skill levels**. Most amateurs and beginning cooks don't need the harsh language; we're not interested in working our way up from a dishwasher to a line cook. We're trying to just make better food at home, either to impress our loved ones, as a hobby we love, or to further a personal goal. I understand that the professional kitchen culture is harsh and unforgiving, but many of us haven't the slightest urge to be in that sort of environment.

That said, I do think there should be an emphasis that people should have done their research first (i.e. if the question can be solved with a quick google search). I think if google comes up with conflicting opinions, if they don't quite understand what google/wikipedia's trying to say, or if it's not a straight forward answer (for example...the one recent post about the best way to remove the horns off a goat head), I would welcome them to our community with a nonjudgmental open mind."

I understand the real world isn't fair.  But I think that sometimes, there's a disconnect with people who don't really understand how difficult situations can be for other individuals."

keypuncher,Republican,1390369517.0,"&gt; I have said much on this topic.

...and much of what you have said is incorrect.

For example:

&gt; One good example of this reliance on society might be private property: there is a compelling argument that when the native Americans ""sold"" Manhattan island for a paltry sum, that they didn't actually understand what was meant by the transaction because they didn't have the idea of private property in their society in the same way it had developed in Western civilization. Of course, the right to the fruits of our own work and labor, and our own private ownership of those fruits is something which you or I would believe to be a fundamental, inalienable, and maybe even innate right of all people, while native Americans had no idea what it was. How could that be if it were truly innate?

Native Americans understood the concept of private property quite well - however, they differentiated between personal property and land ownership.  They believed that land was to be shared, and it was on that basis they may have misunderstood the transaction.  That does not mean they had no concept of private property.

&gt; This is also why it is so difficult to judge human rights standards across cultures and time: our social mores (though seemingly ""innate"" from our perspective) are actually particular to our society, and to the elements which have come to be agreed upon between us within our society (e.g. laws, customs, etiquette etc.). 

Immaterial.  The rights always existed - that some societies chose to restrict them does not make that any less true.

Healthcare is not a natural right because (as others have pointed out), making it a right requires forced service of others to grant it.

&gt; Natural rights exist in a social context; they do not exist outside of them.

Correct, but that does not make them any less natural rights.  Put two people in a room, each has a right to life.  Each has a right to liberty.  Each has a right to pursue happiness.  Each has a right to free speech and freedom of expression.  Each has a right to keep and bear arms.

They start with those rights before anything else happens, before there is any social interaction, and if they are the first two people, before there is a society.

&gt; Ownership is derived as a reaction to scarcity, and scarcity relies on competition which is inherently social.

Ownership can also derive as a result of labor invested.  If I invest labor to make a spear, that spear is mine.  The fact that I could invest more labor to make spears for everyone does not make the spear I made any less mine.

&gt; As a right, it was not always afforded to all people even in the West, and again, came about in the context of society, as society developed.

The fact that some rights were not always extended to all does not make them any less rights - it just means that those with power chose to restrict those rights for those they had power over.  The difference between that and the society the Founders created is that they intended to create a society where no one had the power to restrict those rights.

&gt; I understand the difference between legal and natural rights, however you have not shown me that natural rights maintain their status outside of a social context, and I do not think that you can.

Natural rights do not have to maintain their status outside a social context - rights in general have meaning only inside a social context, because only other humans could choose to observe or violate them.

I have a natural right to free speech and freedom of expression.  While accident or illness might deprive me of the ability to speak or express myself, only another human can deliberately decide to violate my right to do either - or not.  That does not make it any less a natural right.  My government granted me a right to a trial by jury.  That is a legal right, defined by government, which the government can change or remove as it chooses."

He's been a passive-aggressive fuck these last couple of months, calling out everyone in articles and twitter, rather than discussing it with the people like Mitch and Buss in private, like the class-act he should be. All he's accomplishing by opening his mouth is just creating disarray amongst the organization and the fans.

All he's doing is making people stoke the fires for their torches and pitchforks and call for heads. Not saying he's wrong calling for change, but there's much classier ways of doing things.

Again, he's not wrong, but the way he's going about things is dickish.

&gt;Because Magic doesn't like watching the Lakers lose but Redditors love it. Riggin' for Wiggins amirite!?!

I think if you asked any Redditor if they would rather have a championship season vs tanking, 99% would pick the former. But it doesn't look like we'll be going anywhere near that Finals series, so what's the harm?

&gt;Are you suggesting that Tusk is not a viable picked because Alliance only picked him twice.

yes, this is exactly what I am suggesting. unless we get more picks of tusk, it's pretty hard to say he's viable. what is viable also depends on the results of those picks. in one game, tusk ended up being key to their trilane. in another game, tusk was virtually dead weight."

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1390370972.0,"Colors like NYX Taupe, OCC John Doe, and Illamasqua's Hollow are ashy.

If you have warmer undertones (are considering using bronzer) you'd likely have an easier time finding a foundation 2-3 shades darker that would work for you. Sometimes though, foundation ranges are rather strange because each shade will have a different undertone and that can be a drawback. Another reason someone might purchase a specialized product to use for contouring is that they simply are not going to use as much of it as foundation and wouldn't want to be wasteful/have it go bad. 

Either a foundation or concealer would work. You might go for a concealer if it's a cream or liquid product because it's unlikely you'll use all of it before it goes bad, although as far as I know they both should work. "

The 5 Step Test for graduation from booster seats - 

If you answer ""No"" to **any** of these questions, your child must be in a booster seat: 

1. Does the child sit all the way back against the auto seat? 

2. Do the child's knees bend comfortably at the edge of the auto seat? 

3. Is the lap belt touching the top of the thighs, not the tummy? 

4. Is the shoulder belt centered on the shoulder and chest? 

5. Can the child stay seated like this for the duration of the trip?

When I say talk to the sisters, I mean simply voicing that it makes you a little uncomfortable - spare them the shirt rending paranoia. Just say you know it's silly (and it is) but that you'd like some token reassurance. Get to know them. Make friends, and they won't lie to you. Hell, go WITH them all. Make it a cool vacation to see where your SO grew up and get to know her home country.

I understand why this makes you uncomfortable. I'm not saying it's unreasonable to have a niggle. It is, however, unreasonable to try and stop someone going home once a year just because their ex will also be there (they aren't going together, this is not a trip for the two of them, the goal is not to hang out together, they're not friends).

* Ask the sisters to make you feel better/be chaperones. Saying ""I'm okay with this as long as my good friend sister #1 is with you,"" is better than ""No, you cannot go home,""

* Go with her. It'll be a bonding experience and you'll have nothing to worry about. And introduce her to hike girl so *she* has nothing to worry about.

* If you don't trust her to be around someone she's not friends with (and you're saying this is an issue wherever he is, so the trip is officially irrelevant, you just plain can't deal with him being around her), why is that? *I* don't need/want an answer, but you should find one for yourself.

You see all these wonderful, girly clothes and you're super excited to buy them.  But then they sit in your closet for ages because you're worried that other people will make a big fuss out of it.  The longer they sit in your closet, the harder it is to have the courage to wear them out.  Sound right?


I used to be a tomboy, even more of a tomboy than you.  I used to shop in the Men's department as a teenager, but now (at 25) have a very girly style.  How I did it was to transition in pieces of clothing one at a time over an extended period.  I would not add another ""girly"" piece until the piece I was wearing felt like a second skin, and truly comfortable.

For instance, my first ""girly"" foray was a pair of jeans.  Up to then I was wearing men's cargo pants.  I went to American Eagle and bought a pair of jeans from the girl's department.  I wore those jeans once a week until I was comfortable, then twice a week, etc.  After about 2 months, they became ""normal"".  I then introduced a sweater from the girl's department (vs. my baggy boy's skater hoodies).  I wore that once a week.  The entire process took about a year and a half, but eventually my entire wardrobe was from the women's department.  More importantly, every piece was something I felt comfortable in.  And I mean *truly* comfortable, without a shred of self-consciousness.

Give that a try, maybe?  

Since you're 16, you have an **awesome** opportunity coming up in the near future - graduation.  It's the perfect fresh start - a way to dress girly in that way you always wanted but was afraid to, because you didn't want others around you to make a fuss!"

chibistarship,genderqueer,1390373426.0,"So, this might actually be right up my alley. I was born male, but have never been entirely comfortable with it, especially with male stereotypes. A few years ago I came to the conclusion that I'm female and started taking steps to transition. I really wanted a less masculine body and to avoid being manly. I began taking hormones about 7 months ago.

Recently, I realized that I'm most likely genderqueer instead of entirely female. This was due to taking further steps in transitioning. I was coming out to more people, working on being more feminine, and being recognized as female at times. That didn't bother me, but the idea of completely giving up being male did. So, while I do think I'm female, I also think I'm male now. However, I'm still on hormones. I like their effects enough to continue. I might decide to stop taking them at some point, but I'm comfortable for the moment.

Hormones will absolutely have an effect on your body. My fat has rearranged some, my body hair is lighter and less thick, I smell different, and my skin is much softer. My nipples are very sensitive and get sore at times. I'm also growing small boobs at this point. Emotionally, I feel much calmer in general than I did before hormones. This isn't always true, I've absolutely had some emotional breakdowns. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm less stressed, (I'm actually someone who gets stressed out a lot anyways) but I do think that I don't get as angry or aggressive as before. 

My sex drive is definitely reduced and much more controllable. I don't get morning wood or random erections. In fact, generally when I'm horny I just get wet if there is no physical stimulation. I've been masturbating everyday to make sure that I don't have any issues with my ability to get erections, which is a possibility. If that ever does start happening, I will probably stop taking hormones. Also, it's likely that I'm (near) sterile.

I've been trying to present very androgynous. I wear a mix of men's and women's clothing. Frequently I wear women's panties, women's jeans, men's hoodies, men's t-shirts, and Converse. I'm also trying to lose weight to make it easier to be androgynous. I may decide to present more male or female at times in the future. I would like to be able to easily pass as a guy or a girl.

Hopefully this helps some. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Alternatively, you can send me a message if you'd like to talk. :)"

Fullbacks are expected to go end to end, the midfield is expected to press far up field, and the forwards are expected to track back when necessary. Doing this throughout a full season requires an intense physical regimen.

SKC has their own fitness coach, Mateus Manoel, who's worked with both the US and Mexican national team (he was with the former during the 2010 WC). Basically, they've invested a lot in maintaining their ridiculous fitness levels."

When you do not educate the kids who are about to hit puberty about using condoms/birth control (they don't like to fund the program), you end up with kids getting std's, unwanted/difficult pregnancies, and more than likely more kids to fall under the poverty line, never graduate high school, or get a college degree. Most of these states who are spending so much money to limit abortion availability are for the most part religiously dominated, so it is extremely unconstitutional for them to do this. 

And if you aren't going to educate people about something so essential, then you shouldn't be allowed to tell a woman no? If she didn't know any better, why should she be the one to be punished? 

She shouldn't. 

You know what's weird about most of these states, though? They all, for the most part, still support the death penalty.

It's basically not a straight-forward system.

Let me give you an example:

##Construction workers minimum wage per hour:

* Workers with qualification: 174,10 kroner

* Workers without qualification and no experience in the field: 156,60 kroner

* Workers without qualification and at least one year experience in the field: 163,20 kroner

* Workers under the age of 18: 105,10 kroner

Track your calories. You will want to be around 2500-3000 a day. The cool thing about thermodynamics is that your body can only support your current mass with a certain amount of calories a day. Even reducing you caloric intake by 200 will bring you results. 2500-3000 seems to be a good goal (not too little but not too much). It will suck. You'll be craving sugar and carbs, and you probably won't be full for a few months - but it'll be worth it.

FeatherDie,AskWomen,1390375090.0,"I remember a lot of (what I think of as) uninformed slut shaming in school. Young women/girls getting together to discuss boys/periods/sex and all that hooplah. It was the most uninformed bullshit you've ever heard in your life, and it was just constantly repeated over and over and over between female (and male) friends. Things like : Blowjobs are demeaning towards women and make you slutty, all men are after sex so you shouldn't be an easy catch, I don't like that girl (who is more comfortable with her sexuality) so she must be a whore/slut, and so on. 

To me it was the entire community of young students who pushed this mentality. It was not one person slut shaming, but all of us doing it knowingly and unknowingly every single day. 

This is one of the reasons I support proper sexual education classes, and want so very badly for parents to recognize that avoidance, especially under the guise of abstinence, is damaging the entire community of young adults. Making sex a taboo subject not only perpetuates ridiculous sexual 'education', but creates an environment of fear that has sexually maturing people lashing out at each other.

Obviously other factors come into play where slut shaming and sexuality are concerned, but this is what I think of most when someone mentions slut shaming."

CloudDrone,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1390375687.0,"Its pretty interesting, the timbres you've collected here. I think there are a few interesting sounds and its mixed pretty well. I don't know how I feel about the double time feel at 1.00 with this kind of vibe, but thats probably my sensibilities speaking. I much prefer the half time at 1.40.

I'm a big fan of throwing together a bunch of different rhythms, but when you add the other part at 2.00 it feels too busy, like its not gelling together, but then, when you simply change to half time it gets better. It still sounds like you've got two competing bass lines, two competing mid range rhythm motifs, and two competing higher chord sounds.

I'm guilty of the same kind of thing, but I felt like you could have gotten a lot more mileage out of each part if you weren't trying to fight it every time you put something in a certain frequency range. I would maybe think about focusing on making more of a statement with only one frequency band range, or a simpler one, than trying to go all maximalist in this repeating ongoing chillout track. 

So maybe I'm feeling like it doesn't quite know what it wants to be. a lot of simple parts can be cool when they compliment and are very aware of each other, but it starts to feel like a crowded room where a lot of reserved people are trying to get their conversation a little louder than the others around them.

One thing that might be fun to think about is the phrasing and how each part fits inbetween the rest of them. In stead of all 6 parts playing at the same time for 8 bars, you could phrase it more like a conversation with breathing room. Then they would feel like they are interacting with each other.

You've got one foot in a choir like arrangement, and another foot in a conversation, if you catch my drift. Either each voice is completely aware of what all other voices are doing every single fraction of every second, to ensure good harmony, or its a give and take, where one might be quiet to let the other shine, and give a response. 

I hope this doesn't sound like crazy babble talk. I felt like there was a good vision here, just a bit foggy."

As others have stated, Lance did not simply dope, he had power and money and lies that he used to literally ruin the lives of other people. He used his reputation to ruin brands and individuals and has owed over 100 million dollars to individuals, companies, and government agencies for his actions. He lied in front of the US senate. He used his power in the peleton, if Lance did not want you to attack, you did not attack because he would fuck you up. He through had scapegoats to take the doping fall for him. Lance Armstrong was a power man and a powerful cyclist, he is a psychopath who shows no remorse for his actions other than the remorse for getting caught. Really watch that interview with Oprah, he does not give a shit. This man is arrogant, he came back in 2010 because he thought he was invincible and he wasn't. The true scale of his influence on professional cycling is absolutely insane. Lance Armstrong ruined peoples lives, he was definitely good at riding a bike and definitely put hours in... but this cycling talent was certainly helped by doping and does not in any way overshadow how terrible the things Lance did were.

&gt;The Myth of Female Oppression : All of us have been taught how women have supposedly been oppressed throughout human existence, and that this was pervasive, systematic, and endorsed by ordinary men who presumably had it much better than women.  In reality, this narrative is entirely fabricated.  The average man was forced to risk death on the battlefield, at sea, or in mines, while most women stayed indoors tending to children and household duties.  Male life expectancy was always significantly lower than that of females, and still is.  

&gt;Warfare has been a near constant feature of human society before the modern era, and whenever two tribes or kingdoms went to war with each other, the losing side saw many of its fighting-age men exterminated, while the women were assimilated into the invading society.  Now, becoming a concubine or a housekeeper is an unfortunate fate, but not nearly as bad as being slaughtered in battle as the men were.  To anyone who disagrees, would you like for the men and women to trade outcomes?

&gt;Most of this narrative stems from 'feminists' comparing the plight of average women to the topmost men (the monarch and other aristocrats), rather than to the average man.  This practice is known as apex fallacy, and whether accidental or deliberate, entirely misrepresents reality.  To approximate the conditions of the average woman to the average man (the key word being 'average') in the Western world of a century ago, simply observe the lives of the poorest peasants in poor countries today.  Both men and women have to perform tedious work, have insufficient food and clothing, and limited opportunities for upliftment.  

&gt;As far as selective anecdotes like voting rights go, in the vast majority of cases, men could not vote either.  In fact, if one compares every nation state from every century, virtually all of them extended exactly the same voting rights (or lack thereof) to men and women.  Even today, out of 200 sovereign states, there are exactly zero that have a different class of voting rights to men and women.  Any claim that women were being denied rights than men were given in even 0.1% of historical instances, falls flat.  

&gt;It is already wrong when a contemporary group seeks reparations from an injustice that occurred over a century ago to people who are no longer alive.  It is even worse when this oppression itself is a fabrication.  The narrative of female oppression by men should be rejected and refuted as the highly selective and historically false narrative that it is.  In fact, this myth is evidence not of historical oppression, but of the vastly different propensity to complain between the two genders.

You really aren't doing yourself any favors with isolated routines. The key thing is that ""abs"" are not the only core muscles that matter for firming up your lower torso. You need to be doing an activity that builds muscle more naturally to really target all the smaller more subtle muscles that make you firm. You could even be pushing your fat OUT by firming up just the abs! 

Just find dancing workouts, or weight training that uses multiple muscle groups at once (weighted lunges, squats, etc). I do tons and tons of power yoga.

SentientBagOfWater,explainlikeimfive,1390377028.0,"We don't fully know.

A part of the reason is that the virus hides out in nerve cells.  These cells in your nerves can be really, really long, and the virus appears to ""escape"" along their entire length, which is why shingles often leads to a single, long, painful strip of sores.

If virus was replicating in other kinds of cells, say in your skin, your immune system can just kill them off.  You've got plenty more skin cells where that one came from.  Your nerve cells are too important for that though, leading to the first problem - the immune system is more limited in how it can fight the re-infection.

A second issue is that because nerve cells are specifically targeted here any irritation, either directly from the replicating virus or from the immune system doing what it can in the area, can cause very severe pain messages to be relayed by that nerve.  In too many cases the irritation and damage to the nerve can make this pain continue for months or even years after the shingles infection is again overcome by the immune system."

keypuncher,conservatives,1390377724.0,"&gt; Unless this ""transition"" involves them stopping the fight against raising minimum wage, gutting the safety net, and defunding programs for the poor they're not the champion of the poor.

You mean the minimum wage that makes everything more expensive (and thus makes the poor, moreso), the 'safety net' that liberals have converted into a permanent way of life, and programs for the poor designed to keep them in poverty?

Yeah - conservatives are against all of that.

&gt;  And, unless they stop fighting Obamacare that lets sick people actually get insurance, they're not the champion of the sick, either.

A lot of the poor are discovering that health care is even less affordable under Obamacare than it was before.  ...the middle class, even moreso."

Jess_than_three,leagueoflegends,1390379781.0,"Trolling for material for your namesake subreddit? 

On the off chance you're at all serious... 

League of Legends is a game where you play one of several dozen ""Champion""  characters, on a team of three to five players, with the goal of destroying your enemies' base. 

Each champion has five unique abilities: one passive ability, which is (in general) in effect without the player having to choose to use it: for example, for the champion Annie, every fifth spell she casts will stun enemies it hits. The other four abilities are active abilities - you press the associated key to use them - and they vary widely. Some (most) deal damage, some heal or shield one's self or an ally from harm, some give bonuses (buffs) to friendly champions or penalties (debuffs) to enemy champions, some move you (ie leaping forward to strike an enemy), and many do more than one of those things. All four abilities start at rank zero, and cannot be used. The first three abilities have five ranks; at each level, champions gain one point which may be invested into these abilities. At rank 1,you can use the abilities; at higher ranks it becomes more powerful. The fourth ability is the champion's ""ultimate"", and points can't be put into it until level 6; it only has three ranks. 

The basic formula of the game involves one to three ""lanes"", or paths that connect your base to your enenies'. Along these lanes are turrets defending each base, with a no-man's-land in-between. Periodically, groups of ""minions"" - weak, computer-controlled units - spawn at each base and begin marching down the lanes. Turrets and minions attack minions and champions from the other team.. 

The early goal is to ""farm"", by killing your enemy's minions. This gets you experience and gold. As you gain experience, your champion gains levels, which allow you to unlock and upgrade abilities. As you gain gold, you can purchase items in your base's shops. Items are highly varied and have a huge number of different offensive, defensive, and utility effects. Many items can be ""built"" into more powerful ones - buy items A and B, then later on come back and buy item C, and then when you have a little more gold upgrade it to item D (which is better than the first three combined); or buy only item C, then come back later and pay the same total cost to skip straight to D. Another benefit here is that you can only carry six items, so one very powerful item is better than three moderately-powerful ones. 

Complicating your attempts to farm is the fact that your opponents will be doing the same thing, in the same place. They will try to kill you. You should try to kill them first. Doing so gets you a large amount of gold and experience. Failing to do so gets you a respawn timer, forcing you to wait (longer and longer as the game goes on) until you can continue to play. Helping an ally to kill an enemy will also give you a smaller amount of gold and experience. 

As you kill minions and ""push"" towards your enemies' base, you will encounter turrets. If there are minions from your team present, a turret will attack them, allowing you to damage it. If you deal damage to an enemy near their own turret, or if there aren't minions nearby, it will shoot you. Running away will make it stop. Not running away will make you die. 

In each base, there is an ""inhibitor"" for each lane. If you destroy it, your base will spawn stronger minions in that lane for a while. 

Beyond that are two turrets and the Nexus. If you destroy your opponents' Nexus, you win the game. 

Beyond that is the place where champions respawn (and purchase items). The proximity of this area to the Nexus makes attacking the enemy base tougher. 

There's a hell of a lot more complexity to the game than that, but those are the very rough basics and more than enough to get you started. Also you should know that the game **does** have a tutorial mode that explains all of this in a more hands-on way. "

Runes should be aspd and ad reds (will edit with reason in a bit), armor yellows, mspd quints, mix of mres +scaling mres as you see fit

Get golem before t2 boots and get mobis and change them to tabis come lategame because mobis will be useless in teamfights

Don't gank until 4 because you suck until your shield is level 2

If you anticipate an invade start red and make sure blue has vision on it

Make sure you abuse the aa reset on W and attack move

Save hook for when they flash when ganking because people who initiate with it are idiots and usually give up a free kill (there are times when you need to use it first but 99% of the time you don't)

Same with teamfights- i save the hook to disrupt and peel instead of catch; that's what your ult is supposed to do. And let's be real: would you rather have someone panic flash and knock up their whole team as an initiation or sort of drag their tank towards you?

As for a build, golem-boots is standard, but I usually prioritize hp and cdr. Locket is great for this, and other items like sunfire, randuins, and frozenheart are amazing for ad and abyssal and veil are fantastic for ap. visage is a waste of money imo because he doesn't benefit from the healing and the cdr got nerfed. Abyssal gives a tiny bit of damage and a lot of mres and the debuff aura is very useful. Veil has that spellshield which is more useful than the visage passive for naut with more hp for the same cost. Liandry's is nice in theory but I've never tried it on naut because I'm not picking him to do damage, but I would probably only get it as a 6th item or something. "

Thing is, when a brain isn't fully developed, it seems a little... premature.. to saddle it with a mood disorder, (or the hefty mind-altering medications) unless the child is really a danger to themselves or others.

But then I remember that my peers were exactly the same, and there's only *one* of them that I would peg as a probable bipolar... None of them have any diagnosis.

Aprikoat,summonerschool,1390381837.0,"Renekton is pretty good. It's just for garen you're probably not going to be able to kill him unless he misplays or you get a gank. Disengage if he tries to silence you and stay away from him when he spins. If he fails trying to spin enough he'll probably overextend far enough for your jungler to safely gank. Your ult also fucks with his so you can bait him into a bad towerdive with it, and you have hard cc and built in armor shred/dashes while he doesn't so you're more useful later on. 

Garen himself is also good in that regard as a bruiser and his passive makes him exceptional at freezing lanes (so he can easily zone and force poor trades and overextension if he's ahead). He's really scary come level 4-5 and at 6 his kill potential is enormous. 

Shen is tanky enough but doesn't have a lot of damage outside of his passive and Q if they have no sustain

I know you don't like AP but Rumble is a great lane bully who can kite, farm and pole from a distance, and has a shield. Just keep in the danger zone to get the most damage and utility and only silence yourself if you want to smack someone dead when you have no danger of being ganked or slapped around"

*Si les enfants veulent tous devenir astronautes, c'est pour se barrer de cette terre où ils devront vivre toute leur vie.*

*Ensuite ils grandissent, oublient la NASA à cause d'un 5 et demi en maths.
Ils écoutent du black-métal et vomissent la bière vendue par packs de trente.
Ils se haïssent eux-mêmes sans trop savoir pourquoi.*

*Le lycée leur apprend les modalités de l'échec, de l'humiliation, de la clope, et du suicide.
Ceux qui auront leur BAC se ruineront en Malibu-Coca.
Puis, le soleil éclaire un peu plus leur chemin.
Ils voient un peu mieux l'avenir parce qu'il n'y en a pas.
Ils se psychanalysent eux-mêmes en découvrant que tout ça, ce n'est peut-être pas seulement de leur faute.*

*Alors on se met à faire de la politique. Un autre monde est possible. Le changer serait tellement cool.
Ils achètent des T-shirts avec des étoiles rouges et trouvent le mot ""révolution"" très beau, ça ressemble à revolver, mais surtout à évolution.
Ils arrêtent de manger du McDo, refusent d'être français, ne regardent plus la météo; de toute façon demain...
Il pleuvra.*


*(Instrumental)*

*Le doute se mêle à leur tentatives, vaines, forcément; pourquoi refaire le monde, puisqu'il va péter.
Et puis ils se rendent compte que boire une bière fraîche avec une belle brune, c'est pas si mal.
Le regard d'une fille vaut mieux qu'un combat perdu d'avance.
L'amour pas la guerre, ce genre de conneries.
On emmerde une dernière fois la société, puis on revend son poster du Che.*

*Cette fille devient notre femme, la bière fraîche devient notre bide.
On s'entasse dans un meublé qu'il faudra payer. Un boulot et puis une bagnole, avec l'ouverture centralisée et la clim en option.
On économise pour Noël, il y a un peu de soleil à la plage...*

*On devient gros, moche, aigri; les p'tits cons arrêtent des jouer dans notre pelouse et on se souvient qu'avant on avait des projets.
On se souvient...*

*On était jeune, plein d'idées, tout ça pour rien...*

*Parce que maintenant, on attend comme tout le monde son abonnement au programme télé; alors, avant de mourir, on va voir son petit fils. Il veut devenir astronaute. (Voix mélangées: ""Je veux devenir astronaute"")*

*Deviens-le, c'est ta seule chance.*"

MRAs believe that defending men within the framework of feminist theory, which is the dominant discourse today, is impossible because feminist theory is misandric to the core.

kitsandkats,relationships,1390385147.0,"I second the great adventure comment. When I got pregnant in my early 20s, people kept telling me I was 'ruining my life', I'd have to abandon my career and my future. Her father (who was 23 at the time) was also in university resented me because he 'wasn't ready' - neither of us planned to have a child, but I was the only one who took responsibility.

I told him it was over four weeks after having her because I couldn't be bothered with the negativity, abusive behaviour (present before my pregnancy), laziness and refusal to do anything aside from complain and cost me money.  

Having my baby was the best thing ever. I've lost nothing, and I'm 100x happier than I have ever been. I've not had to abandon any part of my life (aside from the travelling, I used to go abroad a lot, and will again when she's older), in part due to great familial support and already having been living independently since the age of 17.

UlgraTheTerrible,TwoXChromosomes,1390385269.0,"The best advice I can give to you specifically: 

Sometimes, the greatest gift you can give someone is the ability to hate you so they can move on. Yes, it sucks to lose a friend, yes, it sucks that you're going to hurt someone you care about, but... 

See... Love is all about strength, and sometimes accepting pain so the other doesn't have to hurt as much. 

I'm not saying you should be a total bitch, either, but maybe don't feel so bad if you have to be a little... blunt... 

Personally, were I you, it'd be, ""We need to break up. I'm sorry I've led you on. It was because I was trying to lie to myself for a long time. There aren't any excuses I can give, and please understand I really do care about you, just not in the way you deserve... It's just... I'm gay, and you're not a woman, so this can't work. I'm sorry."" 

Keep in mind that I'm not actually gay, so I have no idea if this will be easy for you or not, but just... Stay strong, stick to your guns, and realize it's better you tell him *now* than after you've married the poor guy. 

Thing is, doing the right thing (and you know it's the right thing) is rarely easy, and sometimes that means hurting someone you care about to save them from more hurt in the future... Think of it less like ""ZOMG, I'm hurting him."" and more like ""It's going to hurt, but I'm saving him from worse from me."" 

It will probably be okay. 

But. If you're worried about him possibly hurting himself, it might be a good idea to give some of his friends/family a heads up shortly after you do the deed, so they can take care of him properly, and then cease all contact. 

Good luck. "

I.e. if it was Linux only 'now available for PC' might be a legitimate term. My thought being the only reason people read that as 'available for windows' is more due to assumptions based on the norm.

Perhaps the entire phrase 'available for PC' is now completely redundant and uninformative for PC users because they still have to check the SysReq because PC is more exclusive than inclusive term, sort of like an AND/OR statement (or even an 'NOT console' statement)

Maybe Valve can't because as long as the OS is legitimately useable on PC that phrase is valid.

TL;DR: A smart publisher will start using the term 'now available on ALL PCs' when it's cross OS compatible"

Not only do many of the submitters hate children and parents (they'll claim they don't when this is pointed out, but just look at the language they use), but you'll only be further put off the idea of parenthood by exaggerated stories about terrible kids and 'breeders'.

If you really don't want to have a child, and you are totally sure, you need to sit with your wife and tell her that if she wants a child so desperately, she needs to move on and find someone else who wants them too. 

I will tell you one thing, though - children do not ruin your life, especially at your age. Children are not inconveniences, and they aren't just poop machines that scream constantly (that part is pretty short-lived, and is honestly not as bad as you think... they progress so much during that stage that you're distracted by these amazing developments). They're people, and you get to help them grow and become the best they can be. 

But hey, don't take my word for it - I'm biased, because I'm a mother who is happier with her life than she ever was before. I sure wasn't at first... my pregnancy was unplanned, it was stressful, and I had nights after my daughter was born where I sat and cried and thought oh God, I can't do this, it's too much!

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1390386383.0,"&gt; What you described was deflationary currency. Currency value is always related to value that has been produced to the system.

I was thinking more in priming the system, not so much years down the road. Monetary policy would likely need adjustment with time. At some future date the supply may need to increase. However, realize people would not start out with 1k coins. They'd have to accumulate them through the UBI and trading with others. Initially payments would be a small fraction of the available coins. 

Consider UBI payments of 10 UBIcoins/month. This would take a few years for the entire supply to enter circulation. Each month the supply of coins would grow at a quickly reducing percentage. After a year there would be a maximum of 120 coins/person in circulation, though the actual number would be a fraction of that. The rest would be held in reserve to satisfy UBI payments. 

I probably wouldn't even introduce a transaction tax until the reserve was perhaps 40% of total supply so as not to discourage exchange. Eventually though it may be required to properly finance UBI. Though some monetary policy to induce inflation by expanding the coin supply might be in order given these numbers I wouldn't expect that to be necessary for at least 5 years. Likely longer since the reserve would grow by 990 coins each time a new participant joins the network anyway. 

&gt; Put up wealth tax and you discourage earning UBI coins too.

I imagine the wealth tax would be applied progressively at multiples of the per capita supply. For example 10% on wealth between 1,000 and 2,000 coins. 20% between 2,000 and 4,000. And on. Actual numbers would have to be looked at, but you get the idea. That's not much of a disincentive to earn for the foreseeable future, but it is an incentive to spend rather than have hoard coins.

This wealth tax wouldn't be a factor at scale for quite a while as it would take some time for any individual to amass so many coins. The only way anyone would even be exposed within the first couple of years is if they sold goods/services to other UBIcoin users. Years down the line though having such a tax scheme in place helps limit inequality while financing UBI payments. 

&gt; Why would I want to be paid in UBIcoin? We have to remember that it's competing with Bitcoin, Dollar, Euro and gold.

That's the challenge of all these *coins or currencies for that matter. The incentive to begin with is to get UBI without the need to convince governments captured by capitalists. It's up to the supporters of UBI to establish actual exchange value by offering services and products for UBICoins. The motivation to do so would have to come from a determination to establish an alternative independently. Once the system is primed and individuals are exchanging the motivation to accept them as payment is taken from what you can get for them. 

Such an idea may fail, but it may also succeed. At the very least it's a means for UBI supporters globally to act independently in support of the values UBI represents. Fundamentally, success or failure would be in the hands of founding network members. "

UlgraTheTerrible,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1390386460.0,"Well, I'd say try to talk about it objectively. ""The hair"" rather than ""My hair"" and such. 

Thing is, it really would help if you have a solid idea of how you want it to look (meaning, a picture of someone with similar hair texture and density and a style you want that you can show them) because... 

Well... 

If you just go in and say ""fix it""... You might get the *stylist's* idea of ""fixed"" which may or may not be what you had in mind... 

See, thing is, from your story, it sounds like you had something specific in mind, but the way you described it was somewhat open to interpretation. I mean, yes, the stylist definitely fucked up (at least outside of what I would've done with your instruction, but note that I am not a professional, but I do cut hair for people here and there) but there might be a little bit of trouble with how you're describing things... 

And the reason I know this is because I have had a few really shitty haircuts and asked my cousin (who is a professional) what went wrong. She told me that stylists, depending on where they're trained, and by who, often have a more ""specialized"" term for certain techniques... So we say layers, and we get what *they* understand as layers, (which often pretty much means hair that is about two inches long from the roots on the top of your head, and two inches long from the roots on the side of your head, and two inches long from the roots at your hairline) when what we *really* want is what they understand as long blended layers that are razor cut from our ears to our shoulders, etc... 

And it is *really* helpful that you understand that you sound like you got almost exactly what you asked for... But the stylist should know by now that not everyone speaks stylist, and should spend some time clarifying what their clients want. "

I'm biased to a degree because I'm a gamer myself, but I don't think his behavior is THAT harmful. Four hours a day can be a bit excessive, and nine is definitely too much, but it's not so excessive that compromises can't be made.  

First off, let me ask you a question. Would it bother you as much if he was spending this time doing something else? (Reading or pursuing a hobby like woodworking for example?) I feel like video games often hold a negative stigma in many people's eyes and if it's the fact that he's playing video games that's bothering you and not the fact that you're not getting to spend as much time with him then I think you should try to reassess how you view his hobby. If that's not the case then we can move on to potential solutions.  

Have you tried asking him to teach you how to play the games he's playing? There are lots of co-op (multiplayer) games out there that you two could potentially get into, and then you could be spending time together and gaming at the same time. 

That being said, I just read your update and it seems the problem has sorted itself out, but if the issue resurfaces then refer to this post if you would like.

predalienmack,trance,1390387832.0,"- I think Group Therapy by Above and Beyond is the best full trance album I've heard. The album tells a different story to every listener. It's magical. 

- Northern Lights by Gareth Emery is the best trance album to just take a drive in the middle of the night and listen to. All of its tracks are great. 

- The New Daylight and #musicislife are both great albums by Dash Berlin, and while I think The New Daylight is the better album, it does have a song that is truly ruined by the worst vocals I've ever heard in an EDM song (track six, ""To Be the One""). Based on your criteria, #musicislife is an amazing album to listen to with some great collabs with other artists.

- Imagine and Intense by Armin van Buuren are really great albums that just send you on a wild and epic journey as they both start with very different yet masterful ""bangs"" (which one is better is pretty much up to which album's sound suits your tastes more). It's a toss-up for me with those two. 

- Even though I don't like ATB all that much, Movin' Melodies is a classic and extremely unique album of his that's fun to listen to when in the right mood...

- Rising Sun is a very uplifting and interesting trance album by Aly and Fila that gets you pumped!

keypuncher,conservatives,1390387920.0,"This article is a lot of ad hominem and attacking Levin's message without actually addressing it.

It says at one point:

&gt; The other night, mining his writing, he screamed that American liberals “reject the Enlightenment and Enlightenment values.” The proof: “they hate the free market.” (Deep waters, huh?) 

Strictly speaking, he is correct.  A completely free market is unregulated, and liberals never saw a regulation that restricts business they didn't like.  Liberal controlled regulatory bodies are generating tens of thousands of pages of new regulations every year.

The article then goes on to say that Levin ignores the components of the Enlightenment other than the free market - and it is partially correct - because, as the article states them, ""the primacy of science"" and ""spread of knowledge"" are not relevant to the issues that Levin is concerned about.

Two other components of the Enlightenment the article mentions: ""the rights of man"" and ""the rule of law"" are very much of concern to Levin, and are addressed by the ""Liberty Amendments"" - a book he recently published, to which the article refers.

Specifically, the Liberty Amendments address the right to private property, recovering lost rights of states and the people from the Federal Government, and the rule of law - when there are so many laws that not even the Federal Government knows how many (much less what they are), then law enforcement becomes arbitrary and capricious.

The article then pokes fun at simple facts - for example, the fact that George Soros bankrolls many leftist activist organizations (directly or indirectly) as if they were somehow untrue, without offering any rebuttal.

Without listening to the actual programming (which the author doesn't link to or link to transcripts of), it is impossible to rebut his other points as we don't know how (or if) they were presented - the author has already shown himself to be mendacious by this point.

The author then goes into demographic wishful thinking on the electorate, and further wishful thinking on the supposed ""conservative cultural crackup"" - when the actuality is that the reality of the left's policies may cause the Democrats to lose the Senate this year.  Whether they do actually lose it or not, the fact is they are worried about losing it because the American people are hurting 4 years into a supposed recovery that liberal policies are preventing from actually occurring, and Obamacare is making it worse.

If there's a cultural crackup to be had, it is on the liberal side - and long overdue."

keypuncher,Republican,1390388622.0,"&gt; The Native Americans had a conception of private property which was not analogous to that held by the Europeans. I think that the huge example which we agree on is private ownership of land, which is probably the primary conception which is considered a ""natural right"" in our modern society, and which is the precise point I am making.

Ownership of land is not the end-all be-all of the concept of private property.

&gt; I think another nice one would be the right of a parent to command a child, or of the child to be subordinate to a parent, and to in turn be cared for.

Not relevant in terms of a discussion of the rights we are talking about - which are those of adults.  Children are necessarily subordinate to parents due to being children.

&gt; So natural rights don't have to maintain their status outside of a social context? Then how can you say they are more basic than the social order? Don't they exist always and everywhere? 

A plot of ground does not have to have a building built on it in order to exist - but the building requires the ground in order to stay up - the ground is the foundation on which the building rests.  In the same way, natural rights are the foundation on which a society is built.  They predate it.

&gt; On that note, as I am sure you will recall, the right to own slaves was counted among the natural rights for quite some time, referencing the natural order, which was of course simply the predominate social order of the time.

Many of the Founders considered the natural right of liberty to apply to slaves as well - they were just practical enough to recognize that it was an issue that could not be addressed at the time because they needed all of the colonies to be united in order for the nation to survive.  The solution was a compromise that lasted several decades, until the nation could stand on its own.

&gt; Point is: I see the concept of natural rights in general as a sort of delusion.

Then you are right - we do not share the same worldview and are unlikely to, going forward."

Estre,languagelearning,1390389548.0,"Since you only know English right now, I'd recommend starting with just one. Out of your list, I'd go with French because it's what you'll find most resources for and as a result you'll find it easier as a way to get your foot into the door, so to speak. But if you find one of the other ones much more motivating, then you can go with that too. Learning French will give you familiarity with how you learn best, how you learn a language in general, and all the different grammar terms and concepts, which should make starting the next one an easier thing to do.

&gt; What is the best method to attack this goal, one by one??

For now, for you, I think it is. If later on, you're getting pretty good at French but not yet fluent and you want to start simultaneously tackling another, it could work very well for you (though it does not for everyone). Starting with the 5-6 at once would be a recipe for disaster, but I'm sure you already knew that.

&gt; How hard is it for you guys to remember multiple languages??

Not hard at all for me, I'm fluent in 3 languages and conversational in 3 others and I do mostly just ""maintenance work"" such as reading or watching movies to maintain the languages fresh in my mind.

EmergencyTaco,leagueoflegends,1390389686.0,"I really wish people would stop referencing win rates when trying to determine whether a champion is balanced or not. Champions are certainly looked at for nerfs if they're OP in anyone's hands, but they also have to be considered for nerfs if they are too hard to be stopped in someone who has mastered the champ's hands. While I agree that the Renekton nerfs are unwarranted, the Kha'Zix ones are certainly not, and nor were quite a few of the ones you mentioned. (BTW you're missing Hecarim. Nevr 4get.) Look at Kha'Zix's win rate at each level of ranked. In Bronze-Gold he sits between a steady 48% and 51%. This is because lots of low-elo players will pick FotM champions because they think they're freelo and then they'll do poorly on them. If you look at Platinum, though, his win rate is between 51-52%, and in Diamond and Challenger he sits between 53-54%. This is just one example. Twisted Fate had a 95% pick/ban rate in Korea with upwards of a 65% win rate in Korea for a while. That means that at the top levels of play he was utterly stomping. He wasn't as viable for solo queue as he was for team games, but that's the nature of champions. Different champs excel at different parts of the game or different game modes. Udyr sucks horribly at ARAM but I don't think many people would consider him useless in 5v5s. I understand that's a different game mode but the point still stands. If you check the ranked 5v5 stats for TF he is at or above a 50% win rate more than half of the time at high elos.  

I'm not saying that win rates don't mean anything when determining a champ's strength, but they also aren't anywhere near the only thing that needs to be looked at. Look at the top 20 champions in terms of win rate. Of those 20 there are 9 that are almost never played professionally and this is because while they excel at solo queue they just aren't that good at playing on a cohesive team. Meanwhile, if we look at the bottom 30 champions we see 10 champs that have all seen a considerable amount of play in the pro scene lately. I mean Annie has the 32nd lowest win rate of any champion. That means there are 85 champions with higher win rates than she has, but she's still pretty much a first pick/first ban champion.  

All I'm saying is that you need to consider more than just a champion's win rate when looking at whether or not they deserve nerfs. I don't think the problem is that Riot is nerfing the wrong champions, I think the issue is they're nerfing them too hard. Look at Diana for example. All she needed was her AP ratio on her Q to drop by .1 and her ult range needed to be reduced by about 75. What did they do? They reduced her Q's base damage, her W's base damage+shield value, her E's range, and her Ult's range by 150+gave it a damage reduction. It was the same issue with all these other champions. They're trying to do too many big changes when they should just be making slight tweaks until they get the balance right. A champion is a bit too powerful? Drop the damage on all of their abilities by 5-10 and see how they hold up. Didn't accomplish what they wanted? Drop it by a bit more. Don't drop one ability by 60 damage and then add a secondary effect to another ability while also altering the mechanics of a spell and hope that a champ will be balanced, just slightly change damage and CC durations. A great example of these types of changes are Shyvana and Annie. Slightly changed a few things about both of their kits and now they'll see how it fits. If it doesn't work then they'll adjust it a bit more. A terrible example of this is Kassadin's PBE changes. All they need to do to balance Kassadin is drop his damage on his Q by 5/10/15/20/25, drop the silence from 1.5/1.75/2./2.25/2.5 to 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8/2.0 and change the cooldown on his ult from 7/6/5 to 10/9/8 (or maybe 10/8/6) and he'll be balanced. Slight number tweaks is all he needs but instead he gets major number changes and mechanics changes to half of his abilities and his passive. 

**TL;DR: Champion win rates are far from reliable when determining whether a champion is OP or not, you have to look further into it. Riot isn't nerfing the wrong champions, they're nerfing them too hard and in the wrong ways.**"

bardobill,TheSecretWorld,1390390518.0,"I'm still not really at the endgame myself, but these things I've figured out might help:


If you want to solo and then run as DPS in dungeons, you need to get used to the idea of at least two builds, because of hinders and impairs:

* When soloing as magic or ranged DPS, you typically might include some resource consumers that have hindering/impairing effects, to keep mobs from getting close enough to chew your face off, or more likely, to hold them while you back away.

* When you do dungeons as any kind of DPS, it's a different story. Bosses have crowd control immunity counters, so hinders and impairs need to be reserved for the tanks, unless they tell you otherwise.


Later on, as you get more comfortable with swapping, you may actually want to do 3 or more builds, because you can also optimize your builds for single target or multiple targets:

* Chaining consumers, especially when combined with a dropped circle and an area effect coming out of your body, can be a great way to kill groups that swarm you from all sides without having to turn and tab to target behind you all the time. You probably discovered this in Kingsmouth with zombies; it's why I loved elemental when I tried it also.

* But sometimes you really don't want to chain, like when your tank tells you to focus on adds in a certain order in a fight, or when you're trying to just pull one mob at a time while soloing. Much better to drop in some of the consumers that cause more damage to one than to have a hole in your rotation or accidentally hit chain when you shouldn't.

Additionally, in some fights, you'll want the ability to cleanse yourself/party members, or purge the boss, even if you're used to a healer doing it for the group. So you may want to keep yet another specialized build around just for that, or at least remember which abilities you have learned that have those effects, to drop in when needed.

* If you're in a pick up group, the healer may not have been in the fight yet and may not know, or you may be out of line of sight for that cleanse, or they may just have enough to deal with keeping everyone healed and could use the help.

* As you might expect, of course, the abilities with these effects aren't necessarily the top in terms of absolute DPS, or we'd just use them all the time anyway.

* You'll need to purge the Gatekeeper to survive when you solo him to get access to the Nightmare tier."

* In L2 with English subtitles (I usually skip this step, it's too easy to just read and ignore the dubs).

* In L2 with L2 subtitles (I find this most useful for learning)

* In L2, no subtitles. (this is what you should eventually aim for, as real life conversations don't have subtitles)

I can't decide for you whether you'll have a good enough level to watch in Spanish with Spanish subtitles... try it and see how you like it! If it's too hard you can always go with something easier for now."

TheWorldIsAhead,movies,1390391347.0,"Loved John Carter. Few people know this, but John Carter is basically a live action Pixar-film.

Andrew Stanton is a core member of the Pixar ""brain trust"" and after Nemo and Wall-E a big shot at Disney so they gave him full power over everything except marketing during the production. He decided to work with an all-Pixar creative crew so he had Pixar-people on script and production the whole way. For anyone remotely ineterested in why John Carter tanked I recommend John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood. It is one of the most fascinating books I have read on what goes into marketing a Hollywood film and how Walt Disney Pictures works.

http://www.amazon.com/John-Carter-Hollywood-Michael-Sellers-ebook/dp/B00AFCZ1S4

People seem to think that Walt Disney Pictures is an amazing company full of in-house knowledge on making and marketing good films, but actually curtsey of Bob Iger the focus of Disney the last ten years has been to buy lucrative IPs and make them even more lucrative. The people responsible for getting this done is actually rarely Walt Disney Pictures, but rather the big shot producers who work on these films. The success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is thanks to Kevin Feige. The success of Pirates to Jerry Bruckheimer. The success of Star Wars will be thanks to Kathleen Kennedy (and somewhat Abrams who is a big producer in his own right). Iger just buys stuff and then watches it make money.

Carter unfortunately did not fit in with the way Disney did things, and had no big shot producer. It was marketed not by experts working for a big shot producer, but by Disney's in-house marketing team (unlike Pirates 4 and The Avengers for instance who had their own trusted teams), who were notoriously incompetent at the time and dropped the ball on film after film (The Sorcerers Apprentice, Mars Needs Moms and to a lesser extent Tron: Legacy for example).

It's really interesting and I highly recommend it."

UlgraTheTerrible,bipolar,1390391664.0,"1) The cost can vary. My prescriptions put me out about 160.00 CAD monthly. Dunno about the psych appointment, because that, at least, is free for Canadians, but I do know that there are often psychologists/pdocs that will take you on a sliding scale. Good to call around, especially if you've got a local university. 

2) How do you get her to start taking care of herself? Um. Odds are fairly high that she won't be capable to do so unless she's on meds or comes out of the brain chemical imbalance badness coincidentally on her own (which can and does happen *sometimes* but almost never lasts)... And the same goes for holding down a job. Any job. Though good ones for us tend to be low-stress jobs. I personally, at the worst times in my life, had the most job satisfaction (and the longest employment almost ever) working in a grocery store. The warehouse was great on anxious days, the till was great on social days, but I didn't always get to choose... And I've been fairly stable for the past four years. 

Don't know about the assistance offered by the states, but if you call a social worker at social services (usually can be found in the gov't section of a phone book or the internet for your state) they can probably give you some ideas. 

3) Is it possible to talk someone down? Depends on the person, the severity of the episode, etc. 

Bipolar is a lot like diabetes. See, in diabetes, the pancreas doesn't work right and releases too little insulin, causing the blood sugar to rise dramatically, causing damage to all the body's tissue and organs. If you don't take insulin for it, your body continues to get damaged, and you eventually die. 

In bipolar, your brain doesn't produce the right amount of chemicals (this is highly simplified, but it's to make it understandable) to regulate your moods/emotions/thoughts... This can cause us to be severely depressed, irritable, wildly energetic, choose dangerous behavior, act irrationally, believe we're Jesus, and/or believe we're shit and should jump off a bridge.

It's... Not something we can really control, as such, not in the way you can, say, decide to pick yourself up by the bootstrings and get out of bed even though yesterday was a total shit day. 

Mood stabilizers and antipsychotics (not necessary for all bipolars) can take some or even most (for the fortunate ones) of the edge off, but does often result in other issues of their own, like weight gain or loss, short-term memory problems, and extreme fatigue. It can be... debatable... if the quality of life on certain medications is better or worse than it is unmedicated. 

I am a firm believer that *most* of us can be helped by medication, but also that it can take a long time to find a combination of medications that help (there's no *real* gold-standard cure-all for us, because different imbalances lead to the same symptoms, which is what bipolar really is -- a set of symptoms grouped into a category of mental illness)... Sometimes it can take many years to try everything and find the best possible combination, and worse, sometimes it stops working. 

As for coping tactics, highly recommend regular exercise and a healthy diet, as well as meditation and having a decent hobby or three... And this goes for after starting medication as well. 

4)The unasked question... You've bit off a *lot* here... Maybe more than you can handle. When it comes down to it, you may wind up having to call the cops and have her hospitalized (and don't hesitate) if you're afraid she'll hurt you or herself or someone else. We... We can tend to have some major issues when it comes to people trying to be our heroes, and then ultimately discovering that they aren't equipped with what it takes to handle us... Or that they would prefer a partner that can be more equal in a relationship... Or just a partner that doesn't occasionally yell at clouds or start to believe you're a part of a gov't conspiracy to keep them poor and miserable (and yes, this can happen in the worst cases of bipolar)... 

So... Good luck, and bless you for trying. "

UlgraTheTerrible,LongDistance,1390392471.0,"Sounds like it's time for a talk and a compromise. 

Thing is, maybe it is lopsided. I don't mean to say that you care more, or that he cares less, but you clearly want different things, and neither of you are ""wrong"" about what you want... You just have different priorities, and it's leading to an imbalance. 

The real question is, is this sustainable? Are you willing to sacrifice what you want from a relationship in order to preserve *this* relationship? Are you willing to shift your priorities to match his more closely? Is he willing to shift his to match yours? 

Because what you have here, m'dear, is an impasse. You both want different things. Again. That's okay. But ultimately, one of you is going to have to decide if you can give in... (or better yet, find a compromise, like, say, nailing down a definitive schedule when it comes to spending time together/with friends on break)... And, unfortunately, if neither of you will compromise or give in, at least one of you is going to be pretty darn miserable for the foreseeable future, until eventually you decide that the heartbreak isn't worth it. 

So... obvious problem here is that you're more invested in the relationship than he is. Like I said. Doesn't mean he doesn't care, just means he's not ready to commit so much of his time to being with you. You now have to figure out if you're okay with that. Good luck. 

And further, I'd totally suggest just doing what you can to dial back your investment a little bit, try to control some of those wild emotions you're having, but I realize it's difficult to gain mastery over some of them... And it might also be worth mentioning that sometimes, sadness and resentment are there to tell you that this situation can't continue...

I think one factor is that human beings in general can be super mean to each other in competitive environments. For example, I followed the Smite scene for a while (all boys) and the rosters for the most successfull teams were changing every week because there was so much infighting behind the scenes (like arguing who is at fault for a loss or disagreements over practice times or people slacking off). 

That said, there are some factors that might be particular to girls and girls in gaming environemts in particular (I think this was mentioned also in the topic I linked), like girls who were always used to being the only girl in a guy environment and that making them special. I'm not sure how much of this really applies to competitive environments, because I feel maybe there ""normal"" competitive nastiness probably just overrides any regular nastiness.

TheToastofBotswana,AskWomen,1390392954.0,"I think anyone who wants to and can afford to should stay at home with their kids. I wouldn't judge anyone for choosing to stay at home or go to work. It sounds like you're not entirely into the idea of quitting work though but maybe you feel a bit guilty for leaving your baby in someone else's care.

I'm lucky in that I run my own business and can work it around my kid's schedule so I still have work stuff to concentrate on without the guilt of being away from her. I'm sure I would have faced the same dilemma otherwise.

Is there any way you could take a sabbatical? For me anyway, once the baby phase was over I found myself getting back into enjoying work and wishing I could afford childcare so I could have a few hours a day to devote to work. Maybe you can make it so that it isn't an either-or situation. Can you go part-time?"

Do you really think that everyone here is so openly feminist in every aspect of our lives?  We have to keep the peace a lot of the time.  And we are all guilty of sometimes keeping our mouth's shut for too long.  Going against our parents at the very core of their belief system is incredibly difficult.

None of my dad's siblings really have a ""bond"" with him, they only come up to him when they need money, but my aunt has been close to him since he was young, so he thought maybe this would be different.

Well what irritated my dad was that she tried using his kids as he put it. He says she cut my hours hoping she'd see my dad beg/""ask"" her to give me more work and she's afraid if I quit my dad's going to tell everyone how she ran her business.

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1390396447.0,"Definitions of lcm and gcd.

Let a = p_1^(a_1)p_2^(a_2)...p_i^(a_i), b = p_1^(b_1)p_2^(b_2)...p_i^(b_i), and c = p_1^(c_1)p_2^(c_2)...p_i^(c_i)

Let r_n = min(a_n, b_n, c_n) and let s_n = max(a_n, b_n, c_n).

Then gcd(a, b) = p_1^(r_1)p_2^(r_2)...p_i^(r_i). Or the power of each prime is the minimum power of that prime in each number. Similarly, lcm(a, b) = p_1^(s_1)p_2^(s_2)...p_i^(s_i).

In this case, the gcd is 10, so there has to be a 2^(1) (and not 2^(2)) in at least one of the factorizations of a, b, and c (or else 4 would divide the gcd, and so the gcd would not be 10). Similarly, there must be a 5^(1) (and not 5^(2)) in at least one of the factorizations.

Since the lcm is 100, then there can't be any factors other than 2 or 5 (since 2 and 5 are the only prime factors of 100), there can't be a power greater than 2 (or else the lcm would be more than 100), and there has to be 2^(2) in at least one of the numbers and a 5^(2) in at least one of the numbers (or else the lcm would be less than 100)."

In the past just having a degree was enough to put you ahead of your peers as it proved you were not only intelligent but also a hard worker. These days a degree doesn't prove you are better than the majority because the majority also goes to college and many people go to school for a specific field of employment(like accounting).

3. Feel confident enough to play champion in ranked.
4. Champion is recognized for strength and in turn nerfed.
5. Repeat step 1, or purchase RP to save time.

After a certain amount of RP purchased or money invested, your ability to walk away from a game becomes less likely because now you feel like you're *all in* on a game.  It's either because you spent money on skins or champions and the game now has a value-tag added to it, or you invested a great deal of time building up an account with much depth.

Personally, I may want to switch to DotA 2 just to see what the fuss is about; the problem is that I've spent some money on LoL and the idea of walking away from that investment makes me a little bit sick.  Is it because I'm older now and the value of money isn't as lost on me as it was when I was younger?  Possibly, but it's hard to let go.

The nerfs to Kha'Zix, for me, are devastating because I enjoy this champion and played him a great deal even after the nerfs to his evolved W and Tear/Manamune.  It's for this reason that I own Mecha Kha'Zix.  If they nerf Lee, for whom I own every skin because of how much I play him, I may just cut my losses.

It's hard for people to understand the type of sentimental attachment someone can develop for a game, but you have to look at it from different points of view.  There are essentially two types of players - the players who can invest hours upon hours of game time because they are young and don't work (or go to school) and gain IP and then the players who work full-time so they must spend RP to receive the same gains as those with time to build up IP.  I belong to the latter, and not only that, the constant nerfing makes it difficult for me to feel comfortable enough to continue playing.  My game time is limited by my responsibilities as the head of my household, so learning and becoming proficient with a champion enough to enjoy ranked is very difficult for me.  So play for fun you say?  No way.  I play to win, always have.  So basically I would get more enjoyment from playing other games that I'm already very good at that don't have this vicious cycle built in.  I could play ranked Counter-Strike GO (or ESEA if you know what that is), or I could play Day Z or maybe even DotA 2.  The point is that if Riot isn't careful they will alienate the players who belong to the 2nd group of players that use RP to keep up on champions by making it a non-worthwhile investment to continue playing their game.  I already feel like it's not worth my time or money to continue playing LoL because I receive the same amount of [utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility#Economic_definitions) from playing cheaper games; cheaper i.e. less time investment or less monetary cost.

Riot also needs to be careful because they are coming up on a new era in gaming.  An era where parents will regularly spend time playing video games with their children.  If the experience is not fun for both the parents and the children, then they will find other games which makes it fun for both parties included.  I can already tell you of 4 different father-son duos that have quit LoL because the father couldn't keep up with the constant waves of nerfs; they actually ended up changing to DotA 2 and Day Z for their bonding/gaming time.  2 of them spent a lot of money on the game, too, which is kind of crazy but they are well off.

TLDR - The balance team is a total dick.  A stable game is more enjoyable long-term."

mczbot,soccer,1390400802.0,"The rumor aint even that unrealistic.
Dante aint playing that good as last year and isnt getting any younger either. 
Pep is playing a 4-1-4-1, so that means that theres only 1 spot for the central midfield. One spot for one out of Martinez, Lahm, Thiago &amp; Schweinsteiger. Martinez however also fits Peps vision of a Central Defender. Additionally, the signing of Rode actually signals in my opinion that Martinez will move back. Otherwise why would Bayern purchase a 4th backup for a position that just uses 1 player? Bayern is also intrested in signing Ginter, and i doubt Ginter wants to play the 4th fiddle in the central defense.

Bayern does good and smart business. So if Utd offer a ton of money for an ageing central defender and bayern can get their hands on a decent enough backup i could actually see this happening.

Haha. I bounced around to different schools as a kid. I got super bored in regular classes, and most of the time I was in gifted programs and advanced classes. Then there were those tiny schools, where not only were there no advanced classes, the regular classes were even MORE slow paced than usual. Oh my god the days I spent trying SO HARD not to fall asleep. Not once, though, did I transition into being a class clown or chatterbox or anything... I guess that was the whole 'trying to be a good student' thing. My regular grades suffered pretty hard though... test scores were always high, but I pretty much refused to do workbook homework and time-filler classwork when I could avoid it. If it felt like repetitive nonsense work, I read books until the teacher would yell at me or something to put the book away. Then I doodled. Heh."

I know we've seen multiple suggestions on this sub before that are obviously ridiculous things to make the game easier, they hinder development and are obviously not coming from the crowd rocket intended. All I'm saying with the money no developer needs to finish the game after this much support. I wished minecraft could've became better, but it didn't. Solo game enthusiasts created mods and accessibility programs for hundreds of hours by THEMSELVES which should have already been in the game, when you turn to the community to make your gaming experience with that particular game a better version of itself and not just more enjoyable, to me the developer has stopped caring. We have more people but not the intended audience, we are getting some good ideas but I could probably pick out the people who did not start off with the Dayz mod and eventually it seems the good suggestions get drowned out by the suggestions that make it easier for people who just heard about it. I hope Dayz gets there, I'm just afraid of empty promises."

The acceleration is controlled by the acceleration pedal, so the velocity of the acceleration pedal itself is the jerk of the car.  So it's the derivative of acceleration, or the rate of change in the acceleration of an object.  Then you can just keep deriving for the rate of change of the rate of change in acceleration (which is called Jounce)and so on.  Here's a quote from Wikipedia for the names of derivatives beyond acceleration ""The fourth, fifth and sixth derivatives of position as a function of time are ""sometimes somewhat facetiously"" referred to as ""Snap"", ""Crackle"", and ""Pop"" respectively."".  So the first derivative of position is Velocity, then the second derivative is acceleration, the third is jerk and the fourth is jounce.

In that time, we've gone from a small fledgling nation fighting off the world's largest superpower, to gain self governance, to being the largest superpower the globe has ever seen.  Heck, we weren't even much of a global force until World War II, so really, only 80 years of true stability for this country.  The last century has brought global wars, dust bowls and depressions.  It has brought the advent of flight and the shrinking of the world to a scale that has never been seen before.  Who knows what the next century may bring?

Overall, I really hope that you're right, but I suspect you're not."

talman_au,dogecrafters,1390404175.0,"What is going to happen to the dogecoin balances on the server? I also had a withdrawal which left my balance which never got processed. And some in diamonds.

Although I agree that the economy was unsustainable, I think if those balances aren't honored then, you will have no credibility for future dogecoin dealings. Like at anytime balances on server can be wiped without warning.

But moving forward, I think all balances have to be restored and honored to restore faith in the server.

The server should put dogecoins into the economy by:

* posting regular limited bounties for different materials not just diamonds
* competitions or bounties to build creations on the server
* a faucet like mechanism to claim a small amount every hour, for people who may not be the best at collecting things or building, but still encourage them to play on the server.

Additionally to recoop some of the costs:

* limiting building near spawn for a large radius (600-800) then charging rent for storage at spawn and shops at spawn. People with shops near spawn last time had to be first on to a new map in order to claim the best positions and this will change that.
* charging of other perks which do not affect game play, like chat flair.

I don't agree that you NEED PvP in order to stimulate the economy and it will breed distrust and an unfriendly atmosphere.

These were some of my ideas for integrating dogecoin in to Minecraft when I was looking into it before discovering this server, I am offering them here for the good of dogecoin and this community.

Willravel,horror,1390404182.0,"Even though the Oscars are a bit of a joke (imho), a lot of very serious people in the movie industry take it very seriously, or at least pretend to enough to act on its seriousness. If there were a Best Horror Picture, I suspect you'd see a lot of bigger names step forward to push mainstream horror films, but, more importantly, you'd probably see studios more willing to gamble on new up and comers who have different ideas and perspectives on the genre. Yes, a bubble would probably form initially, but, after it collapses and has a few years to recover, I suspect you'd see a thriving horror genre with a wide variety of original and derivative works to satiate the desires of the likes of us. 

I'm grateful for great current generation horror films like *Let the Right One In*, *A Cabin in the Woods*, *Shaun of the Dead*, and *The Conjuring*, but these films all had to struggle against the prevalent idea that horror is a lesser genre. Dramas don't have to do that. Action movies don't have to do that. Romantic comedies don't even have to do that. More often than I think a lot of us like, horror is an excuse for having jump scares and nudity instead of a compelling story and characters. For every *28 Days Later*, we get ten *Resident Evil*s and *Scary Movie*s and *House of the Dead*s. An Oscar category would undoubtedly change that perception. "

Sounds like you're going through some of the stages of loss. Maybe it's colored by the loss of your previous relationship, maybe it isn't, but the fact is, you're... well... not coping so well right now. 

Essentially, welcome to lovesickness. Now, the thing is, it's pretty vital to your relationship and also your overall wellbeing that you fight as best as you can to remember how to enjoy life and have hope, otherwise you're going to find yourself alone and depressed. 

It sounds like maybe you've... well... gotten so absorbed in your love that you've forgotten who you are as an individual... This is generally *not* a good thing to do, and often results in breakups, or worse, a lifetime of codependency. 

But!

You can recover. And part of that is doing what you can to retain your individuality, so you can grow and learn adjacent to your eventual life partner (be it this man or not) instead of growing all tangled and weird into and through each other until you can't survive alone but are killing each other together. Yes. You and your love are now trees. You're welcome for that awesome analogy. 

Thing is, positive ideas will only make you feel like shit if you don't, you know, actually accomplish anything positive. So maybe start with small goals. I've been there, I know how it is, and yeah, I had to then recover from the loss of a relationship... so, small goals: Like getting out of bed and having a shower and getting dressed. If you're already there, congratulations, you have a better starting point than I did... 

Once you've accomplished that, you go to class, and get involved in some of your old hobbies... You know, those things you did and enjoyed *before* you ever had a boyfriend... Maybe read a book or paint a picture, point is, do something *just for you* that doesn't revolve around your boyfriend. 

Not *only* will it make you a happier and healthier person, it will give you something to ""bring home"" to the relationship, something to talk about... 

And that, m'dear, is how you start to have a healthy and functional life and relationship. It really is that simple. All you've gotta do is come up for some air once in a while, to remember just who you are, outside of the ""we""... Oui?

I can freely install it on a friend's computer if I should need to.  I like the various interfaces available. Mixxx was also the only one that let me set up my sound system how I needed to; even the included Serato wouldn't let me use the MTP soundcard for headphones and my computers regular output for everything else. (The lack of settings in general for Serato has permanently put me off using it)

Now, I'm probably not the best person to answer that, honestly.   I've only tried Mixxx, VDJ Home, and Serato Light(? whichever came with the MTP).  I did like VDJ, but given the above things the slightly better interface it has wasn't worth everything else that Mixxx gives me.

For controllers, my only experience is with my MTP, which works perfectly with Mixxx provided you have at least version 1.11.0.  You can make it work with 1.10 and previous, but it requires adding some community stuff.  The MTP has a couple things that I feel to be drawbacks (I'd hope so, considering it's such an entry-level controller); the controls don't seem to have great sensitivity and the tempo sliders are shorter than I'd like."

Now, they're utterly adrift with no real message of any urgency. They can't get ""generation"" right, and they probably learned their lesson about making specific, citable predictions when 1976 rolled around.

2014 *means nothing*. They've moved on from the generation of 1914 having any specific end time. AND YET, 2014 still represents a remnant of a superstitious belief in round numbers. *100 years*…seems significant in our heads. But only in our heads. The bible just about never dealt with such tidy neat numbers. But we, with our decimal system, have a hard time letting go of 100 meaning something.

So I think the Society is doing the best it can right now to feed that superstition without daring to actually say anything about it. They know full well, even if they lie about it, how that worked for them in the past. 

Meanwhile they get to reap the benefits of people thinking ""2014! OMG, 100 years! This could be it! I've got to be IN!""

It doesn't matter.

because no matter what you have planned when you go into labor, nobody is going to be upset that you have to cancel or change your plans. You have plans with your best friend? ""I'm in labor"" ""Go have that baby!"" You have plans with your boss? ""I'm in labor"" ""Go have that baby!"" You have plans with the president? ""I'm in labor"" ""Go have that baby!"" You have plans with the pope? ""I'm in labor"" ""Go have that baby!"" seriously. no body wants you squirting out a baby at their feet, no one is going to be like ""no squeeze your knees together and keep your plans with me.""

ulvok_coven,AskHistorians,1390405056.0,"Yes, I have read it. Maybe you should read my post more carrefully. Marx's definition of capitalism has three parts:

1. It's voluntary, meaning no slavery. Yes, it's only nominally voluntary, but that doesn't matter. It's *more* voluntary than feudalism.
2. There are capitalists, who by nature add no value to the products from which they derive profit. They own the means of production.
3. Workers are paid for labor time, not product value, and this generates surplus value.

And all three of these are necessary to define capitalism in Marx. The third one less so, since it's interpretive more than anything. The post above defines capitalism as being private ownership, which isn't Marx - and bad history, too. It also defines feudalism as production derived from the monarch, which is *also* not Marx. Marx's feudalism is compelled labor where the owners of the means of production *are producers themselves,* but not necessarily using all the means of production which they own.

You can have allodial landowners working for themselves which are *not* capitalists, because they own the means of production *and produce.* A capitalist is not a producer. No capitalists means no capitalism. That's my big critique here."

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22841958

Even if the concept DID work, such a mask would need to activate when the sleeper hit REM sleep, and Remee doesn't do that. A more expensive mask ($300+) with such a timer supposedly induces lucid dreams 13-30% of the time in someone who is *trained and experienced* (though I'm skeptical of that figure).

In short... your mom is quite right that this is a complete waste of ~$100.

firematt422,FordRaptor,1390405674.0,"Don't get me wrong, there were some great people there and there was fun to be had. But, after driving 13 hours to get there only to spend 17 hours of day 1 in the truck... I didn't want to do day 2. 

Off-road the event was good. I got stuck twice, which is all part of it. There was always plenty of help for me and anyone else that needed it. I never felt like I wouldn't be able to at least get the truck to a mechanic in town should a worst case scenario arise (which luckily for me, it never did). Two trucks lost 4x4 on the first day and both made it to town safely for repairs. 

I just couldn't get over the fact that people were driving recklessly on the road, and the days were just too long. I often felt peer pressure to drive past my limits to not hold up those behind me or lose the ones in front of me. Maybe I'm just a wuss, but 200 miles in a 17 hour day is a lot after a 750 mile drive to get there. I would've preferred the event to be more like the descriptions I read beforehand which cited unique restaurants, snow tubing and night skiing in addition to offroading. 

TL;DR: It's not a bad event, it just wasn't for me. If you're interested in long, hardcore days with nothing but offroading, this would be a good event for you.

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1390405808.0,"They are wrong. Very, deeply, wrong.

A is a subset of B means that for every element a of A, a is also an element of B.

Now let A be P(S) and B be (S).

S is an element of P(S). S, however, is *not* an element of itself. The *elements* of S are what are in S.

Example: Say S = {a, b, c}.  Then P(S) = { {}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {ab}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c} }.

Is {a} an element of S? No. {a} is a set containing only the element a. The element a is an element of S, though. So since P(S) has an element not in S, P(S) is not a subset of S.

With the same S and P(S), P(S) \\ S does not make sense in that the elements of S are not elements of P(S). If you had P(S) \\ {S}, then that would be { {}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {ab}, {ac}, {bc} }."

UlgraTheTerrible,raisedbynarcissists,1390406223.0,"It's hard, you know, to feel empathy for your abuser... Especially when, so often, it just lures you back into being abused again. 

Thing is, of course there's unique parts of their personality. Mom's told me stuff about her childhood that... Well. My mother was always a chubby girl, and developed a lot of, shall we say, ""assets"" pretty early on. She has told me stories that indicate she was sexually inappropriate to others, even at a very early age, namely kissing boys at school who didn't want to be kissed. 

Her own mother called her ugly, according to my Mom... Now, I knew my grandma. She was blunt, a lot like me, but she wasn't cruel... According to Mom, this damaged her a great deal, but I still can't tell whether she was making it up or putting a spin on it... because she was always jealous whenever I indicated I missed my dead grandmother. 

See, the thing is, N's are often *deeply* insecure, but to combat it, they create this battle armor of denial and half-truths, and even outright lies.... And they will do almost anything to protect this... false sense of self that they create, so they don't have to acknowledge the truth... 

There is no getting through this armor. Sometimes, if you're *very* adept with dealing with N's, you can crack it a bit, but they don't like that, and will often act *even crazier* if you do, until they're able to repair their armor. And when they repair it, they reinforce it, so... there's nothing you can do for them. 

Not one thing... 

It's actually the deepest tragedy of being involved with an N... 

Because, their true selves, their deepest beings... Are often highly traumatized children that they've built an extremely unhealthy coping mechanism to protect... Which *also* explains why Narcissism tends to be a cycle in families. After all, you can't beat 'em, you join 'em, right? 

It's also why, when they lose it, they tend to act like those emotionally fragile children. I think a lot of N's stop developing emotionally at a fairly youngish age. I'd put my Mom at about the emotional competence of your average 16 year old most of the time, and when she really loses it, she goes to about the emotional age of 7 or 8.. 

And there isn't a damn thing you can do for them, because they can't handle anything other than their worldview. They can't love, not really. They can't handle really being loved, because they're always going to be suspicious of it. 

And they pass on way too many of their traits... 

But yeah, this is kind of the reason why it's hard for people, even those like me who are doing pretty well emotionally these days, to really let go of it. 

But sometimes, the most loving word there is is ""No.""... 

No, I won't take it anymore. No, if you treat me like that I won't deal with you. No, I think it would be best if we stayed out of each other's lives, because I obviously make you miserable. 

So where is the true self? Somewhere where we can't get to, in a place they can't get to themselves anymore. And it is really truly heartbreaking, because there really isn't any hope for them.... 

---

But then, they don't notice that so much as we do anyways, so I guess the obvious answer is to *allow* them their delusions while steering clear of them as much as possible, because that's when they feel safest and most comfortable, and ""happy,"" I suppose. 

And ultimately, we have to pick up the pieces of our own damaged lives, as best we can, knowing that they've damaged us a great deal, but acknowledging that we, at least, are not like them, and don't have to live in a universe where everyone and everything is isolated and threatening, where you have to take what you want because nobody will just give it to you... We don't have to live like that. 

Which is something, I guess. "

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1390406419.0,"I have two worldbuilding tropes I hate.

1. Teleology of tech. In real life, the Europeans were lucky enough to learn about gunpowder from the Arabs, who learned about it during the Mongol Empire from China. And they were doubly lucky to learn how to grow rice from Africans and maize from Native Americans. Tech may spring out of ingenuity and necessity, but hell was its development sporadic. Silk, for example, was a ridiculously useful fabric which was produced in one country alone for centuries. The secret of steelmaking was used and abused by India and later totally lost. Too many fantasy worlds give everybody roughly the same tech, even if they're on opposite sides of the world and don't trade with each other.
2. No tribes! 'Uncivilized' tribes *still* exist in Europe. Nomads have never really gone away, and they fulfill an important niche in places like Africa and the Himalayas. People forget the little tribes on the peripheries, despite the fact that some of those tribes burned Rome, and another one conquered all the land from the Pacific to Bulgaria.
3. EDIT: Forgot one. The super-empire. China, the most powerful polity on Earth during the medieval period, had most of its warfare within its own borders. Alexander's empire had collapsed within a generation. The Mongol Empire in 91 years. The Roman Empire lasted quite a while, but it too was very internally involved, and dwarfed by the size of many other Empires. Even *with* magic, the continent-spanning Empire is very unlikely. I think Erikson plays this one the best in Malazan - within the *lifespans* of the Empire's creators, it's already been broken back to an island and a couple of far-flung principalities, because the 'best of the best' either went to become demigods or rebelled against the Empire in their greed and ambition.

&gt; Empire? Checked. Republic? Checked. Kingdom? Gotcha! How about Duchy? State? Nation? Commonwealth? Territory? Sultanate? Khanate?

Interestingly, these things are all different, and in a super-big world you might have all of them. Republics have popularly elected officials, kingdoms have kings, empires have kings and client-states and usually colonies (Russian and Mongol Empires are good exceptions to this rule), commonwealths are governments dedicated to the common good (which is more a philosophical statement), 'territory' would be another word for 'colony,' the sultan is a autarch which still answers to a hegemony, and a khanate has an autarch which is elected by the nobility. Duchys are tricky because they can have a couple of different meanings. 'Nation' and 'state' will work if and only if it's a one-race country in a many-race world because those concepts are anachronistic before, say, the Napoleonic era.

&gt; Gigantic, Mostly Empty Wasteland

You're underestimating how many of these there are on Earth. Most of the North American continent was this, into the 1800s. There's the Balkan and Siberian steppe, the whole rest of Siberia, northern Scandinavia, most of the huge African continent, most of the Middle East, much of China...

He then finally orders after that point, and proceeds to slowly eat. I'm willing to bet he spent around 3 hours doing this, all for a $20 meal. I don't know about anyone else, but free food or not, my time is worth more than $6/hour. Especially when it's my own personal time.

To top it off, he was actually wanting to get a free dessert out of it. This tells me that he was willing to spend this much time and effort on something that's probably only about $5 to begin with. Huge waste of time on his part.

With all that said and done, I'm happy to see that the scumbag diner was just trying to use pity to get a free meal. I expected to see something abusive judging by the post title."

kornberg,consulting,1390406920.0,"1) What type of position do you want? What do you want to do, specifically? What is your ideal day to day work? You need to know the answers to these questions before anyone can point you down the path you want. 

2) Eeeeh, maybe. Your BSE GPA is a bit low but your MSE is good and you have a lot of good extra-curriculars and will probably have a banging awesome resume if you have mastered resume creation. It really depends on the recruiting at your university. You have a chance, it just depends on someone getting your resume and on who that someone is. I'd say to keep your options open.

3) Like I said previously, it depends. Personally, I really like seeing someone mature over time--if they can mature on their own, they will keep improving and getting better with me. Personal growth can predict the sort of person I want working for me. That said, I am not a consultant (yet) and my hiring days are in the past for now. Some recruiters/hiring managers are going to see 3.1 and immediately put you in the no pile, if your resume even gets to be seen by human eyes. The best way to get around the GPA would be to have a really solid cover letter that gets the recruiters and hiring managers excited about you before they see the sad GPA. It's not terrible, it's just not great so it's something you can get around but maybe not. I know, that's annoying but it's real life. 

4) Wait on the PhD unless your school is offering to pay your tuition in exchange for teaching. For the most part, PhDs are not worth the money you spend on them. I am working on a MAOD--I wanted to do a PhD program but after some research, I determined that my earning power was not increased at all with the PhD. I may go back and earn one later but right now, I want to wrap up this MAOD and get to working. Spend some time working in the field before you spend the time and money on a doctorate. Experience is the best teacher and you will be kicking yourself if you get a PhD in something and end up hating actually working  in the field you choose after spending a few years working. You won't know what you like until you spend some time doing it.  

And don't forget, a PhD is a degree for researchers. Unless you want to work in academia or with patients, a PhD is pretty useless excepting when you want to make people call you Dr. It's easy to think that since a BS increases your earning power and a MS/MA increases it even more that an even fancier degree will make your income explode but that's not the case. PhDs are generally underemployed, unemployed and/or not working in their desired field. Last I looked, they have one of the highest unemployment rates for the college-educated demographic. Also, in some cases, a PhD can work against you when you're looking for employment because you're overqualified. PhDs applying for lower level positions tend to ask for too much money, frequently have a condescending attitude towards the work and their coworkers and usually leave the moment something better shows up. That stereotype gives you a lot less flexibility than you'd have if you stuck with the MSE. "

You'll find that the same things apply to women.

Nearly every girl is ""laid back"" and ""down to earth"". They ""love to laugh"" and equally enjoy going out on Friday night or staying in with a good book. 

They're looking for their partner-in-crime, someone to go on ""adventures"" with, and everyone is a budding chef just looking for that partner to cook for.

Everyone is ambitious, but they know how to have a good time. They love camping (but they won't tell you that they've been once and it was 10 years ago) and hiking.

Let's face it. Most people are unoriginal.

superspeck,flying,1390407634.0,"KASE is a one-way-in, one-way-out airport, especially when it's at minima and you're in a jet. There is a nonstandard visual approach for Rwy 33, but it has to be specially requested and *as far as I know* most jets can't make it -- the runway basically ends facing a large hill or small mountain, depending on how you define 
'mountain' when you're already on one. As far as I know, you have to be flying a highly maneuverable plane in perfect weather without gusting winds to make a 33 approach, basically, or you risk getting blown into a hill while you're on approach.

All of the instrument approaches and all standard approaches are out of the north. Sometimes you can't make it in, period, although the airport isn't closed. It's one of the reasons that Aspen's charts notes that you should have briefed the go-around and be prepared to diver to Rifle or one of the other alternates that's less challenging. 

In this case, the Challenger 601 was reporting up to a 33 knot tailwind on their first go-around. That's ... quite a lot, and they probably should've diverted at that point.

superspeck,learnprogramming,1390407816.0,"Self-taught. I had a problem I needed to solve, and the best way to solve it would be to write something in the only tool I knew of that I had available, which was MS Access '97, and the only language it ran, which was VBA. 

At the time, in the late 90s, Google wasn't a great resource. I ended up just using big dead trees books that I got at the computer book store. They taught me the basics of a dynamic scripting language -- loops, conditionals, functions, use of objects, placing UI elements, things like that. 

After I successfully solved the group's problems with the tool I wrote, I got interested in computer science. I took a course in Linux scripting and a course in VB 6 at the local community college. I got an internship at a 2000 era dot com, and used the bash scripting to torture the sysadmins. (I'm not kidding. They had everything on the 'content' side of the house where I was working locked down so that you had to go through a stupid HTML-based tool to do any real work. Thankfully, they didn't lock the shell, and I used bash to write an automation tool that hammered the web interface.) 

Then I switched my major to computer science ... and fell flat on my freaking face. It turns out that there's a big difference between *programming* and *computer science*. I couldn't deal with the computer science people, because they wanted to be *right* and I wanted to be *useful*, and neither one of us respected one another. 

I switched my major back to business, this time choosing logistics as my concentration, and kept working a combination of internships an full time jobs in IT. It turns out that this was a fairly brilliant move on my part and it was completely due to the fickle pencil of fate. Yes, I did ""eeney meenie miney moe"" on the course catalog. :-P 

The field I got a degree in goes by many names -- Industrial Distribution is one, Supply Chain Management is another. Logistics is one study of business systems; it just happens to be a set of business systems that deal with moving physical products around. Computers are ideally suited to solve problems in this field, and the training you receive in capacity planning and job ordering applies equally to a data processing environment in the IT field.

I fuckin miss the CJs. Those were the best Jeeps ever made, and the easiest by far to work on. I had an 89 Wrangler for a while, and dropping the tranny to replace the clutch was way more trouble that I expected. Never again. 

I turned out to be more of a truck girl over time. I had a little 88 Nissan that I used to tear up the desert dirt roads with. That was a lot of fun.

werewolfchow,AskReddit,1390407883.0,"Society has continued and in many places thrived despite racism. If it was so obvious that racism was wrong on a universally rational level, the slavery debate in pre-civil war US would not have been so heated. 

The fact is that ""racism is wrong"" is something you (and I, I'm not racist) believe, so therefore it is not hard to come up with examples for why it was wrong. It's an extreme example, I admit that, but the point is that if you were indoctrinated by a religion you would tell me there are a lot of examples why religion (and your religion in particular) were beneficial and right.

To be clear, I'm not defending religion or any particular religion. But the idea of ideology in general (not specifically religious ideology) is that you can't see beyond the boundary of that ideology. The fact that we both take for granted that racism is wrong is because that is the ideology we share, but for centuries (millennia?) the question of whether one type of person was better than another was part of every nation's ideology and rarely was it questioned from the inside. See colonialism, see imperialism, see early Mesopotamian archaeology where kings had carvings of their neighbors bowing to their own people carved on their walls.

My point is that religion has currently become an unpopular form of indoctrination, but don't kid yourself that it's the only form of indoctrination. And that's not a bad thing. Kids are dumb. They can't reason yet. They need to be just told something and told that it is true before they can reason it for themselves, whether it's religion or not. "

But as someone who has mined for a year and also ganked for a few months (not on the same acct obv) fly a skiff, or better yet a proc. The yield is just as good as the retty and mack, but with a better tank.

Remember the 3 barges/exhumers have different roles. Cov/Hulk is mining yield, ret/mack is cargo space, proc/skiff is tank. I don't ever try to gank glowing procs or skiffs bc it's not worth it and i'd probably fail. 

My proc tank would require 9 catalysts all t2 fitted to kill. It's never a good target. The only thing you really get out of a skiff is a little more cargo space, since the yield isn't a ton better.

I don't know how easy it is to draw parallels between what happened back then and what's happening in Ukraine today, but I do get the impression that many Russian speaking Ukranians are just as nationalistic as Ukranian-speaking Ukranians and do not wish for Russia to simply reintegrate them. Remember that common language does not make a common nation - e.g. Austria and Germany.

When you look at his skills he seems a natural fit to play somewhere in the middle up top (CAM/ST/Support Striker) but when you watch him on the pitch he seems to be the most naturally inclined to play on the wing of all our wingers in that, regardless of which side of the pitch he is on he plays the wing as a winger (stays wide, links with the fb, can beat a man on the dribble, hits crosses has a bit of a shot etc).

He really seems like he may be one of our most versatile players and i think that works against him....because there isn't anything in his game that makes you think he is weaker in one position than another but he also seems less likely to excel at one position than another.

As for a business? I've heard many people saying you should be friends with your business partners, but not go into business with your friends.

kornberg,relationships,1390409088.0,"Call a lawyer--maybe ask your dad if he knows someone who would be a good choice? You probably shouldn't use him, even if he was willing to be your attorney. Your dad could possibly give you some advice on how to deal with money and the house and whatnot until you can consult with someone else. Even if you don't have the money now, talk to a good attorney. They will give you a consult and advise you of rates. Many attorneys will allow you to pay as you can and/or pay at a lower rate since you and your children are victims of domestic abuse/violence. 

File for a restraining order and get the locks changed. Put all of the household money into a new bank account that she cannot access to clean out. Do not spend a dime on anything other than food, shelter, bills and gas. Marital assets can be tricky but as long as you're using it to provide for the kids, you're probably entitled to any money you guys have right now. It's generally OK to put money out of her reach if you're not spending it on non-essentials. 

Go to your kids' schools NOW and take her off of the authorized pick up list. If she gets the kids into her custody, it's going to be hell to get them back, even with a restraining order and pending charges. She could skip out of state and disappear with your kids and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Bring the police report and the restraining order and the schools will cooperate. Ask them to inform the teachers so that they are aware. I know it's hard to do this but you also have to talk to your kids. Say that their mom is making bad choices right now and that they cannot go anywhere with her until you say it's ok. If she shows up at school or at a friend's house, they need to get a teacher or police officer and tell them that she has a restraining order and they can't go with her. Make sure that they understand that they are not to go anywhere with her unless you tell them personally that it's ok. Reassure them that they will be able to see her later but right now, they can't.

If you can, get a PO box so that she can't steal your mail. They are pretty cheap--it's worth the small expense. Change your passwords for your email and social networking on a computer that is not your home computer or phone. Look for keyloggers and other spying software--I'd probably just back up data, reformat (totally wipe) and  reinstall your operating system and whatnot. It's a hassle but it's the best way to keep her out of your stuff. She can and will sabotage you. She will get into your account and delete emails asking for you to come in for a job interview, she will delete emails that make her look bad that you could use for evidence, she will send harmful emails to potential employers and she will send emails from your account to hers that will chip away at your domestic abuse case. Installing keylogging software and remote access software is ridiculously easy--she's probably done it already and has been all in your stuff for years. You need to lock her out before she gets out of jail. 

Reach out to your old friends. They will be more understanding than you think, especially if you tell them what happened. Moving back to your old area is definitely a good idea. 

You can't get instant work but don't let that keep you from getting a job. I went back to college at 27--I was almost 30 when I graduated and thinking about that almost kept me from going back. Then I thought ""well, what else would I be doing at 30?"" Getting a job now doesn't help instantly but it will help in the future. Don't fall into that trap.

Also, check with the city and county where you live about mental health services and talk to the Domestic Abuse Hotline people--you are a worthwhile person and you are a great dad. You did something very difficult in order to protect and care for your children. There are resources out there that can help you--both logistically and mental health-wise. You need therapy and your kids need it too--it's available for you, you just have to ask the right people."

SATA power connectors should come directly from your PSU. They will plug into your storage drives and optical drives and provide them with power. The SATA data cables most likely came with your motherboard. They go directly from the storage device into the SATA ports on your motherboard (normally bottom right corner). SATA power are a long L shaped connector. SATA data are short L shaped connectors. Look at the back of your storage device, short and long L, data and power.

I am curious about your husband in this whole thing. Essentially, you're both in demanding jobs, both parents of your baby.

I know that there are phases of clinical trials, ([preclinical to phase V](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research)) where they adjust dosages and participants in controlled enviroments.  They start with low doses on animals to move these tests to clinical trials, where they then try low doses on healthy volunteers, moving slowly to larger doses on more and more real patients.

1. When I taste my beer before bottling, the flavors are obviously not totally developed yet... that is, I find that bottling and bottle conditioning adds a lot to my beer. When you're kegging, do you have to keg condition? is the conditioning mostly just due to the carbonic acid from carbonation? if I keg, will I need to keep my beer in primary/secondary for longer?
2. I'm planning on getting a 2.5 gallon setup, because I don't have room in my apartment for a dedicated fridge. Is there any place to find these stupid things for less than $100? or even used? I can't seem to find them for cheap ANYWHERE.

I would even have panic attacks when my family went out of town and I had the house to myself. 'Sleeping' with the lights on, being on the phone as much as possible to have some kind of 'human' company, etc. 

My boyfriend of nearly two years was 3 months from graduating when I made the decision I was miserable with him and we weren't working out. We were looking into getting a place together once he found a job, and in the impulsiveness of being newly single, I decided to just do it on my own.

Cheesecake on a stick, it's the BEST thing in the world!! I don't get lonely, I don't scared to sleep at night. I LOVE the independence of it all. It is, literally, the best/happiest state of mind I can ever remember being in. I accept that there will be times I might feel lonely, sure. But I have lots of loving friends and family, and there hasn't been a single night in the past three months I haven't climbed into bed and thought 'I love my life' before turning out my light.

keypuncher,conservatives,1390410197.0,"&gt; Only if prices go up more than minimum wage has been raised. Historically, that has not been the case.

On the contrary, prices have gone up far faster than the increases in the minimum wage each time it has been raised - that is why all the charts show the nominal minimum wage as being lower now than it has been in decades despite raise after raise in the rate.

&gt; In blue states where they expanded Medicare, the poor are getting subsidies and getting on Medicare.

Of course we all pay for that - both up front in payroll taxes, and on the back end in the interest the government has to pay on the money it borrows because the payroll taxes were not even close to enough to pay for Medicare even before we added millions more to the rolls.  Medicare used up just under 25% of Federal revenues last year, and it will only be going up from there.

That said, you're thinking of the Medicaid expansion, not Medicare - and that was another 12% of Federal Revenues and rising rapidly as well.

An occasional cigarette/drink/joint won't hurt anyone, but frequent binge drinking/heavy use of cigarettes or pot certainly will. A casual fap won't kill anyone, PMOing everyday will be harmful.

If you want to get rid of an addiction, you have to fully stop it for a time. In the context of someone addicted to masturbation and trying to overcome it, masturbating = relapsing = bad.

But more generaly, and even if I am catholic, I won't consider fapping as bad... as long as it is only part of a healthy sexual life, and no addiction.

We could also never neuter enough of them to threaten their numbers. Too few people are able to fix strays, and too many people don't fix their own pets for that to happen.

Right now, millions of them are dying and suffering because there's such a large number of them. You say I'm not thinking long-term, I'm saying you aren't paying attention to problems happening right now for fear of what *might* happen in the distant future. You're willing to accept the suffering of millions of animals out of a fear that has almost no chance of becoming reality because it's just not practical.

&gt;Everyone please report all these people that show up in every god damn thread. Get these people off reddit.

Reporting someone who hasn't broken a subreddit rule does nothing.

DukeCanada,AskMen,1390410592.0,"Your reading comprehension needs work. With regards to *confidence* for most people, I said you need to be able to approach. That means initiating the conversation. It could be a friend, it could be a cold approach, it could a friend of a friend. Whatever, just get out there. Get out of your own head. 

After the approach is done then you can progress, but you're not going to get a chance to do that if you don't approach in the first place. I'm not talking about your flirting/skills/gaming ability. I'm just saying that *confidence* means you're willing to put yourself out there. "

Solor,PS4,1390410601.0,"As much as I hate to say it, it is unfortunately true. At this current moment, yes the PS4 is equivalent to a ~$800 PC, but thankfully due to standardized hardware on the  PS4, developers can squeeze more out of it then you probably could with a PC.

The problem is that how fast computer hardware is progressing, means that by the time The Division is released, that $800 computer I mentioned above, will now cost ~$500 to build. It's only going to drop as time goes on. Several years from now, a 'budget' $400 PC will be on par or better than the PS4, etc.

Cheap budget PC's are going to be even more viable due to how quickly the integrated graphic chips are catching up with the low to mid range dedicated video cards, which is just going to compound this issue."
MaeBeWeird,BabyBumps,1390410604.0,"&gt; Needless to say I'm switching midwives to someone a liiiiiiittle more nice and understanding.

Good.

Because it doesn't matter about the reaction to the weight gain or the reaction to the pepcid prescription... if she rubbed you the wrong way you are better off with someone else. You need a care provider you are comfortable with, because one of the most important things when giving birth is that you aren't stressed out. So if your care provider stresses you out that isn't good. 

I hope your new one is better and can give you a good answer on the weight gain."

leavenworth,relationships,1390410628.0,"Agreed, continued communication is key. I just meant that bringing up that she used to think differently is probably just going to make her feel defensive or guilty, as it's something she is clearly aware of, and it won't help them resolve anything. "
Chaos_Spear,AskReddit,1390410638.0,"I don't care what anyone says.  I believe it was meant to be ""*I went to the Danger Zone*"".  I mean c'mon, that's so much cooler than ""highway"".

I have been in arguments about this.  People have pulled up lyrics on the internet.  I don't care.

Now, if Kenny Loggins himself called me up, just tell me I'm wrong; I'd be forced to draw the only logical conclusion available: Kenny Loggins is under duress, forced to hide the true lyrics from the world.  And I am the only one that knows the truth."

Freedom of speech isn't a massive fallacy, its a belief. At the end of the day, no one is hurt by the Westboro Baptist Church's belief. If someone was, they would be prosecuted. No one that actually lives nearby WBC (such as myself), thus the people most likely to be offended, take them seriously at all. They're just the butt of jokes. People dress up and show up with counter signs to mock them.

Now if what the WBC directly drove someone to suicide, they can be arrested. If what they said damaged someone's image (but lets be honest, they don't have that kind of power at all. No one takes them seriously), they can be sued. Freedom of speech is a belief that people can allowed to say what they want within boundaries. It doesn't protect you from social repercussions and it doesn't protect you if its a crime. Theres this myth that you can say literally anything in the US system and thats not true. There are boundaries. People however *should* be allowed to express their thoughts and feelings without a Big Brother telling them how to think. If freedom of speech didn't exist, then the civil rights movement in America would've happened at a significantly slower rate. Gay rights would be far behind than where they are now. Freedom of speech doesn't exist purely to protect morons, it protects the rights of people to make societal change and speak out against the general consensus they believe is wrong. When we start to tell people what is and isn't ok for them to say, we restrict freedoms and we restrict our own ability to change our minds on issues that effect society. Freedom of speech exists to protect the underdog, to protect those whose opinion may not be the consensus. Its an important fabric of American society that many are proud of. Not every non-American understands, but its something thats ingrained in our culture and isn't going to change and neither should it. It isn't a massive fallacy, its a belief and its our right to see it that way.

UlgraTheTerrible,raisedbynarcissists,1390410765.0,"Personally... 

My Mom tried. She's pretty well an N, but it's also a pretty clear case of Borderline Personality Disorder as well. So, she's not... as bad, if you can really rank these things, as some of the other parents you read about in here... But she has *zero* insight into her problems, because ""clearly"" they are everyone else's problems, and not hers. 

I kinda lucked out, to be honest... My Mom taught me to read and write before I ever hit school... Quite the little party trick I was, 3/4 years old and able to write my name upside-down and inverted, reading simple books at 4, and high-school level at 6/7... 

But while, in retrospect, it was pretty twisted of her to make me sit and rote learn those things at the age of 3/4 when I wanted to be outside running around and playing, I *did* learn to read, and I *did* read everything I could get my little hands on... 

In some cases, this was *wildly* inappropriate content for a 6 year old child... Mom did enjoy her V.C. Andrews... But the minute I hit school... I found the library. And in it, I found books. And in those books, I found moral code, strength of character, and an escape from the hell that was home life... 

I shudder to think of what I might have become without Jane Eyre, Frodo Baggins, Richard Cypher, and Harry Potter, to name a few. 

So yeah, I got half my morals from the library, and the other half from children's TV... 

And you should've seen the shitstorm *I* put up when I got told I read too much and she was going to throw out my books. I'm still proud of 13-year-old me. "
