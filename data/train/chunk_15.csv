keypuncher,politics,1389323915.0,"&gt; Is there anything unconstitutional about the police asking a cab driver where they took someone (without a warrant of course)?

Nope.  The cab driver can also refuse to answer.

Of course, under the most recent interpretation of the 5th Amendment, if the cab driver does refuse to answer and the police decide to charge him with something, his silence can be used as evidence of guilt.  ...and he doesn't actually have 5th Amendment rights unless he specifically invokes them.

&gt; When you make a phone call, you know (or should know) that the phone company keeps records of that. So there is really no expectation of privacy to begin with.

There was an expectation that the data was held by the phone company and was private.  I, for example, could not reasonably expect to call the phone company and get a copy of your phone records, even if I offered to pay for them.

&gt; There is the expectation that nobody but you and the person you are talking to can hear the call and that it is not being recorded, so it would be violation to record that without a warrant.

...and the NSA was doing that too - via secret, rubber-stamp courts using secret interpretations of law to get secret, blanket warrants that gagged those they were executed against.  ...and they claimed that was all supposedly legal.  Then they did it without warrants too."

shinyquagsire23,Nexus5,1389324142.0,"I just wanted to say that when I got my Nexus 5 I was **really** surprised about the sound quality. Every other review said it was meh or really bad, but mine was really loud. And on top of that the device hasn't lagged a bit since buying and installing all my stuff on it (which includes rooting + XPosed + custom kernel to enable the double tap to wake feature from the G2). Also, a slight note on the camera: The digital zoom + focus is amazing. I might just be saying this because I went straight from a dumbphone + laggy tablet to the Nexus 5, but it is *really* good in that area. [here's a picture I took of the threads on my backpack](http://imgur.com/uSjjSDG). [Zoomed out version](http://i.imgur.com/kCflEfq.jpg)

I can also comment on the resolution's DPI (as well as the framerate). I was playing Temple Run next to a buddy of mine who was doing the same on his iPod 5th gen. There was a very noticable difference between mine and his, mostly in the framerate but also a bit in resolution. Ofc the framerate is msot likely with the graphics unit in the Nexus 5 vs the iPod but it was very noticable, like 30FPS vs 60FPS.

Lastly, I'm just going to say that I've gotten a lot of comments on my phone. People will notice that I got a new one and ask something along the lines of ""What phone is that? It looks cool."", although I did get a ""Is that a Windows phone?"", which was apparently because it had the white back. A few people knew that it was a Nexus but they were Android fans so that's kinda obvious. But my basic analysis is that if you got a Nexus 5, you would definately not be disappointed at all, especially coming from a lower-end to midrange phone."

dewprisms,budgetfood,1389324275.0,"If you get a rice cooker, try to get one with a steamer basket in it. Get fresh veggies that are on sale and steam them with your rice to keep your nutrition up. Broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, onions, carrots, and potatoes are all cheap and can be steamed, and all but the potatoes are also good raw. If you will be cooking within an hour or so, grab a bag of mixed frozen veggies and use that instead if you prefer. You can get bags of frozen veggies for $2 or less, often $1 or less when on sale. Don't bank on storing frozen veggies unless you will retain sub-freezing temperatures for multiple days in a row- if they thaw and re-freeze the texture will get all gross.

Avoid the mayo. You don't want to risk getting sick. All shelf stable mayo I have seen says to refrigerate after opening. Try grabbing packets from restaurants when you do have the luxury to go out. Grocery stores often have packets as well near the premade sandwiches in the deli counter. They usually have other condiments as well in packets.

If you want meats, get cured meats like salami, pepperoni, etc. Or go to the deli counter and buy a couple of slices of meat so you can eat it right away and not have to worry about spoilage.

It's a little more pricey but there are some cheeses that don't require refrigeration- usually the small spreadable cheeses like Laughing Cow, and some places sell shelf-stable single serving packs of cream cheese. Just be sure to read the labels carefully, and use the stuff sparingly.

Buy fruits that don't need to be kept cold. Apples, citrus fruit, and bananas are all good and don't need anything special to deal with them. Avoid berries- they rot very quickly, even when kept cold. Pick up a lime or lemon and cut a few slices off every day and drop them in your water container to flavor your water and help yourself get a few extra vitamins every day for relatively cheap. Avocado are very calorie dense as well as nutrient dense, and you can get them for $1 - $2. Those would be good to mash up to mix with your tuna.

For grains, try to get brown rice instead of white- it has higher fiber and will keep you full longer. You may want to also grab canned beans unless you don't mind soaking dry beans, but I honestly don't know how you could cook those (if a thermos would work, or if you could use your rice cooker).

If you have a thermos to keep water hot and want a variety to drink besides water, you can pick up cheap tea bags and some honey. Honey is shelf stable and you can pair it with peanut butter for sandwiches.

You can probably heat up the contents of canned food if you get really hot water in your thermos and let it sit for about 20-30 minutes, and then dump the water and pour in the canned food and let it sit and heat. It may not get HOT, but it should get warm at least, which would probably be fine for soup. Bonus for condensed soups like chicken noodle or tomato that needs to be cut half in half with water anyway- don't dump out all the hot water. You may want to save a can so you can measure how much you need to retain in the thermos though. Canned soup in general is fairly cheap (especially if you get it on sale) at about $1 - $1.25 a can for the ""better"" brands of soup. This will help you get a better variety in your diet because of the veggies and such. You can have soup and a cheese sandwich- it might not be grilled, but it's close!

Some other stuff that comes in consumable packages that you could get away with retaining for a day in a cooler, even with minimal ice (or even in your trunk if you didn't run your car too much and the temps stay chilly enough) is the small packs of cottage cheese, yogurt, some places sell two packs of already hardboiled eggs... I think my brain just quit thinking of food, so hopefully this stuff gives you some ideas to start with that isn't all pre-packaged foods."

killroy1971,AskMen,1389324553.0,"All men feel week and impotent several times in their lives and we deal with it differently.  We don't talk about it to women.  Sorry but few women are terrible listeners.  Most dismiss it, a few see it as weakness.  All loose respect for their guy.  See why we'd rather smash in our own skulls than share?
Men judge themselves by what they can do, and what they have accomplished.  it's why we play more video games, jump out of more airplanes, get into more high speed accidents, and attempt more household repairs.  It gives us something to do, something to achieve.  When what you do isn't appreciated or doesn't contribute to something that matters, we loose our sense of self.  It's hard for women to understand because as other posters have pointed out, society judges you by different standards.  Don't believe me?  When Hillary Clinton first ran for office, people judged her for her pantsuits, not for her ideas.  By all accounts she did a decent job as SecState for someone who was really a very junior Senator and not well versed in geopolitics or diplomacy."

My mistake, wasn't thinking. I also didn't realize that Quake and Half-Life were the same game. Because they aren't.

&gt;If you are still able to play it, which shouldn't have anything to do with popularity unless there's like 1 server, and it's located in China and passworded, then you are still getting replayability out of it. I don't get how that is fucking hard to understand.

But if no one's playing it, the replay value probably isn't incredible.

&gt;I also like how you conveniently ignored these 2 sentences I wrote at the end:

&gt;&gt;And what the fuck does the game people go to when they leave another game have to do with anything? That has abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with how much replayability a game has.

I thought it was too ridiculous to answer, but fine: if there's replay value, there will be people playing the game. You don't see an amazing, polished game with thousands of hours of replay value immediately be abandoned, because if it's good, people will play it and if it's replayable, they'll keep playing it."

but yes, you need heat to cause a sprinkler to go off. most sprinkler systems will work this way but their are specialty ones for high hazard areas. more than likely you will never be in a building with this type of sprinkler system 

a sprinkler system is not designed to all go off at once. the water supply would just not keep up. typically they are designed to put out a room that catches on fire. 

if an entire building caught on fire you would have some problems. a sprinkler should throw out water 7.5ft in all directions but if every head goes off at once the pressure will drop and their will be areas that are not going to get wet 

TL;DR if a sprinkler doesn't get hot(really hot) it wont pop.

Do you notice any specific worrisome patterns in his lack of acquisition or in his pronunciation of the words he does know and use? 

You don't mention whether you guys are actively encouraging him to use his words, so maybe try that for a week or two before spending any money on a speech therapist. For instance, when he makes the sign for milk, you say ""yes we can have some but first can you tell me with your mouth (tap your lips) what its name is?"" Or, ""you're a big boy now and big boys use words! Let's TALK about the things that we see! What is the name of this toy? What color is this?""

Edit: just saw your concerns about bringing the issue up with her and her tendency to always see things as wrong.

PlushieChomby,relationships,1389326188.0,"One more person chiming in to say that you're not being ridiculous, but your boyfriend absolutely is. 

You are, however, letting him run ramshod over your fiscal common sense. It's wise of you to try to stick to a budget; it's not wise of you to let yourself be pressured into maxing out your credit cards. 

Is rent in your area cheaper than what you're paying living with him? Because if you're not ready to completely break things off, like I honestly think you should do after reading all of that, you might at least consider moving elsewhere, somewhere with roommates to help cut costs for yourself during the next four months at least. It would give him an idea of what his household bills truly are, since he doesn't seem to have a clue. You're paying for cable but he's the only one watching it? You're putting *your* money into *his* home's equity? You're buying 70% of the groceries, and he won't even return the favor of picking something up for you when he's out although he expects you to do it for him? Sugar, he's either clueless as to the boundaries and necessities of a good relationship, or he's thoughtless regarding your needs - neither of which is a *good* thing. Besides, if he has to start paying all his bills himself, house and food and cable, perhaps he'll be in a place to learn a little fiscal responsibility of his own. 

It's easy to think about all the time you've put in together and feel like you'd be losing something if you stepped away now, but I urge you to ask yourself if you can keep living with a guy who's so blatantly inconsiderate about your finances. Granted I've never been in a traditional relationship where the guy pays for everything, but every relationship I've been in (both where I was the sole breadwinner and those where I was an equally contributing partner), if one person wants to do something that the other doesn't have money to do, the person who has the money to take care of it *takes care of it for both*. That's just how good relationships work. Money shouldn't be a huge issue in a quality relationship, and his actions are clearly making it one in yours. 

I wouldn't say it's that you can't afford him so much as it is that you can afford to do so much better than him. When I read that he suggested you take out a loan to go on vacation with him, I almost fell over. Then he gets **upset** about things like that?! Seriously, WTF. *He* doesn't think *your* debt is a big deal. You clearly know it is. Just reflect on that for a moment. Reflect on how he's treated you, how he's made you feel, and how he's got you questioning whether you're a ""cheapskate"" when you're clearly trying to be responsible with your funds. That is a bad sign. Several, actually, all rolled into one big You-Should-Nope-The-Fuck-Out-of-There. 

At the least, make a list of both how you feel about the relationship and why, what both of you contribute, and what your finances are going to look like for the near future. Go over your list a few times, and when you feel ready, sit him down and have a calmly rational conversation referencing your now-mental list of what's been going on and what the effects on you have been. Hear him out, but don't let him upset you. If things get out of hand, walk away and agree to talk about it at a later time when both of you can forego emotionally charged replies and/or arguing, anger or crying. 

Honestly you're still so young with *so* much ahead of you in life, I'd strongly encourage you to start thinking about a future without him, because if he's set in his ways, you're going to be super unhappy if/when marriage and/or children enter the picture. Then it'll be a lot more difficult to split and start over, or you can sentence yourself to more years of unhappiness and squabbling over something that wouldn't even be an issue in a healthy, well-functioning relationship. 

Whatever you decide, I hope things go well for you and work out for the best possible path for you to be on, and that you find someone who understands fiscal responsibility is good for *both* partners. "

gazork_chumble_spuzz,feminisms,1389326704.0,"&gt;When you use the same label to apply to prejudice that is and that is not backed by power, you erase the severity of that disparity.

Both are fueled by the same hatred. Systemic racism exists because enough people with the same racist feelings decide to do something about it. Systemic racism would not exist without *individual racism*. 

&gt;By equating the two with the same label, you minimize it as if that history of oppression (which continues to affect the lives of minority groups) has ended (or never happened).

I don't see why that would be true. The same racism that leads a majority to oppress another group is the stuff that leads a minority to hate and view with suspicion members of another group. It's the same stuff; it doesn't have the same consequences, but at its heart, it's the same racism.

&gt;That's not unique to racism. Women can hate men for being men (though I don't believe this really happens), but the effect of that does not extend into legislation stripping men of their rights. People of color can hate white people for being white, but that doesn't lead to hiring practices where white people's chances of being hired are worse than that of convicted non-white criminals. Trans people can hate cis people for being cis, but that doesn't create an epidemic of murder against cis people.

That is all true; but it doesn't make their hate any less hateful or in any way defensible. It's the same hate even if the consequences are not the same. The same hate that would lead conservative men to lobby for laws that repress women's rights is the same hate that would make a woman hate men. That's all I'm trying to say - the consequences do not have to be the same for the underlying hate (be it racism, sexism, homophobia, whatever!) to be equally fervent and equally wrong...and it should all be equally condemned when it's encountered.

&gt;Prejudice by marginalized groups against privileged groups does exist, and it can even ruin lives. That's tragic, yes, but for all the harm that's done by prejudice, does the majority affect the privileged group, or the marginalized one? We have data on this. Things do not look good for marginalized groups. 

Well, I care equally for both. I can't stand double standards, and so when I encounter a minority person shit-talking a white person I feel equally obligated to say something as I do when I encounter a white person shit-talking a minority. It's why I react with equal frustration when I see homophobia as I do when I see a homosexual referring to straight people as ""breeders"". I can't stand prejudice, and I don't see the point in trying to label some as worse than others. It's all equally bad to me. It all springs from the same place: a need to feel superior to others, and hate. On an individual level it is all equal."

I'm not on hormones yet because it's only been 3 months since I realized I *wanted* them. I'm also not going to have insurance in a few months, so I need to fix that first. And I still need to talk to my doctor and an endocrinologist about it since I've got an unrelated hormonal condition that might be affected by T. Finally, I'm not out to my family, and I want to be in a more financially secure position before I tell them, just in case, since T has pretty drastic effects.

I'm glad you liked the timeline. I don't blame you for liking me in a dress. I do make a really attractive girl, and I'll probably still cross dress every once in a while.

I know how you feel about being excited by learning transgenderism exists, but not wanting to rush. That was kind of my reaction. I realized I was trans because I saw transition videos of guys on youtube and was kinda overwhelmed by how envious of them I was. I was mentally all over the place for the next few weeks. I even had some serious doubts for a while because of how intense and sudden my desires were, but i've settled into my identity now. 

Glad I could help. Curiosity is welcome. I'm sure some other folks will reply too. "

“What?” she asked. His eyes darted to the side as he let out a nervous laugh and repeated “will you marry me?”

She couldn't even meet his eyes. Her mouth was agape, all her former calmness having dissipated. She glanced around the restaurant. More than a few other patrons were looking on sentimentally, feeling undoubtedly honored to witness such a happy occasion as the promise of one to another. She felt like an idiot, clasping the stem of her champagne glass in which he had placed the ring. When she noticed it was in there upon taking a sip, he had smiled, got down on one knee, and cupped her other hand.

*Oh my god, why.* She smiled and slowly drew her hand from his, urging him quietly to get back in his seat. Embarrassment crept from her heart up to her cheeks as she watched him confusedly sit.

“Brian,” she started, internally screaming but attempting to remain understanding, “I was the one that invited you to this dinner.”

His brow furrowed for a second before leaning over the table and clarifying with a harsh whisper, “are you saying no?” He stared at her incredulously, both of them trying to ignore the audience they knew was there--gasping and whispering to their dinner companions while trying to hear what was going on between The Guy That Proposed and The Girl That Seems To Have Said No.

“I invited you!” She repeated, each word hissing through her clenched teeth. “You can’t propose at a dinner you didn’t set up!” Her effort to stay quiet was battling with her anger and embarrassment.

“You asked me to a fancy dinner, at a formal restaurant, and you’ve been distant lately so I thought--”

“Are you kidding me?” Her voice lost the ability to whisper in that moment. She bit down on her cheek as he hushed her. “Brian. I invited you to this dinner so we could talk about the relationship! I told you that when we set up the time.”

“I know! I assumed it was to talk about moving forward and I thought I’d surprise you!” He slumped back into his seat and sighed, running a hand through his hair. She placed her head in her hands, fighting the desire to release a moan. Looking up, she noticed how devastated Brian was beginning to look. She felt awful, but another part of her wanted to yell to the restaurant that this wasn’t her fault! She took breath.

“I’ve met someone else.” He looked up with his jaw dropped, not unlike how she assumed she must have looked when he had proposed minutes earlier. An audible gasp came from the table behind them. She turned slowly, glaring menacingly as the table of middle aged ladies suddenly became very interested in their menus. Brian was clearly deciding how to respond. It felt like a movie to watch the different emotions take their turns flashing across his face.

“I never cheated on you!” She whispered, earning a scoff and eye roll in return. She hit the table. “No, I’m serious. I never did. I just--we’ve been having problems, Brian! Jesus! I was trying to do the right thing here, but I didn’t know you were going to ask me to marry you!” He just continued to shake his head in disbelief, staring at the table. A waiter walked up to the table completely unaware of the situation, asking about refills. She opened her mouth to tell him to leave, but Brian spoke first.

“We just need the check please. And could you call for a cab?” His voice was direct and reflective of the business man he was. She could recognize the tension in the undertones.

“Of course, *monsieur*, would that be for you and the lady?” The waiter, beginning to sense what he had just walked in on, smiled uncomfortably. Brian let out a laugh and bitterly replied that it would just be for him. She squirmed and thought about how nice it would be to have a giant hole swallow her immediately. The waiter left and Brian turned to her with the same professionally emotionless face.

“I think we’re done here,” he announced with a smile and dead eyes. Neither moved for a moment as she attempted to determine whether he was announcing his own exit or giving her permission to flee. She awkwardly reached for her clutch, drew back, then grabbed it and stood up. She felt eyes following her as she walked out. When she got to the door, she hesitated and looked over her shoulder. Brian was fishing the ring out of the champagne glass. Her breath caught in her throat as she went through the revolving doors, firmly crowning that situation as the most painful she had ever before witnessed. Her phone vibrated in her bag. She checked it.

*Have you done it yet? Did he cry lol? Call me when ur free babe. Xo.*"

whoremongering,gaybros,1389328137.0,"I'm not interested in justifying circumcision or mastectomies. I object to your original statement that circumcision increases or does not protect against HIV--it is clearly protective.

&gt;you can't deny that it's a bit weird that the US has such a high HIV transmission rate AND a high circumcision rate, compared to Europe where both are lower - explain that...?

The US does not have a “high” transmission rate. We have a rate of [10.3 per 100,000 new HIV infections](http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/hivfactsheets/todaysepidemic-508.pdf), whereas Europe has a rate of [7.8 or 5.8 per 100,000 depending on your definition](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/hivaids/publications/2013/hivaids-surveillance-in-europe-2012). Twice as many new infections are explained by the fact that we already had twice as many HIV+ people living with HIV [(0.5% versus 0.2%)](http://kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-global-hivaids-epidemic/). Thankfully, the US has a relatively low transmission rate compared to other parts of the world. [Sub-Saharan Africa has 3 times the population of the US but 33 times as many new HIV infections.](http://kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-global-hivaids-epidemic/) Once again, this is largely because [sub-Saharan Africa simply has a much higher percent of people already living with HIV.](http://kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-global-hivaids-epidemic/)

But why would you assume circumcision status is the only factor—or even a main factor—that explains the difference in regional incidence of HIV? New HIV infections in the US are almost entirely attributable to a few higher-risk behaviors: men who have sex with men, high-risk heterosexual sex (e.g. with sex workers), and injection drug use. These factors are further inflected by [poverty, discrimination, stigma, homophobia, prevalence of HIV in certain communities like MSM, incarceration, cultural and language barriers, and a number of other factors.](http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/hivfactsheets/todaysepidemic-508.pdf) Clearly, circumcision alone is not going to protect against injection drug use, and is not sufficient to protect against promiscuous sexual liaisons. However, the single group responsible for the majority of new HIV cases in the US is, unfortunately, men who have sex with men. [Anal sex is associated with a markedly greater risk of HIV transmission than (heterosexual) vaginal sex](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/risk.html), and circumcision does not protect bottoms from being infected through anal sex. Add to this a general dislike of condoms unrelated to circumcision status, and it should be clear that circumcision is only one of many factors influencing HIV transmission.

It does still, however, reduce HIV transmission."

blueshiftlabs,linuxquestions,1389328155.0,"[Here's how the LastPass login sequence works:](http://blog.tinisles.com/2010/01/should-you-trust-lastpass-com/)
  
1. You click the ""Login"" button on the LastPass vault. This gives the client your username and password.
2. The LastPass client computes a hash of your username and password.  
3. The client sends your username and the hash to the server to authenticate. _Note that your password is **never sent** across the network._
4. The LastPass server validates the hash, sets up your HTTP session, then replies with the encrypted password blob.  
5. The LastPass client passes your password through PBKDF2 to generate the decryption key. _Note that this key is **different** from the login hash sent across the network, and **can't be computed** from any of the information that was._  
6. The client uses the decryption key to decrypt the password blob.  
7. The client parses and uses the decrypted blob.  
  
If your HTTP session gets hijacked, the attacker can repeat steps 3-4 in order to download the password blob. What the attacker *can't* do with that attack is steps 5-7, because that depends on the password (which was never a part of the HTTP session).  
  
**tl;dr** When your girlfriend logged in normally, the client knew her password, and could compute the decryption key. With a session hijack, you don't have enough information to compute the decryption key.  
  
**Edit:** Note that this whole thing is a moot point anyway, since LastPass exclusively uses HTTPS, which is designed to mitigate attacks like this."

pricks,powerlifting,1389328436.0,"Linear and block are superficially similar, but have different contexts and historical use. Linear periodization is: ""...one target after the other. Such pattern of training is called linear periodization."" (Zatsiorsky, Science and Practice). To the people downvoting me: please find a quote from any source that contradicts Zatsiorsky.  
Check this out:  

&gt;It is interesting to note that linear periodization or Western periodization is actually a misunderstand Third Zoom Level (load progression) of advanced Olympic lifters. Those guys spend some time at emphasizing volume of training and technique at doing great number of sets at lower-medium percentage of their PBs in clean/jerk and snatch (i.e. 8-10 sets of 2-3 reps at 70-80% or something like that) and then transitioning to intensity phase utilizing smaller number of sets with greater intensity (i.e. 4-6sets of 1-2 reps with 80-90%). This way they approach planning the load for development of strength-speed necessary of Olympic lifts (linear periodization). How do they integrated development of strength-speed with other components like relative strength, muscle mass and reactive strength is a matter of Second Zoom Level.

&gt;But some wise guy(s) from Western hemisphere used this linear progression of the load (where lifters utilized great number of sets with 1-3 reps at lower intensity) that was used to develop strength-speed for Olympic lifts and applied it to Second Zoom Level by utilizing 10-15 reps per set in volume phases and 1-3 reps per set in intensity phases and named it Western periodization (or others did this for them). This way they passed through whole repetition continuum and stressed most of strength qualities in serial manner. And then confusion started with the idea that you must spend some time with 10-12 reps to improve your 1RM. That’s OK with the novices, kids etc, but this was actually suggested to advanced lifters. Yes, there is time and place for this too, but the issue I am trying to emphasize here is that you cannot analyze one system using only one Zoom Level, you must understand all three of them.

You called TFC a Half-Life mod, which is a technicality. It's effectively the same as a Quake mod that would have existed with or without Half-Life.

&gt;THERE ARE STILL SERVERS LEFT FOR ALL OF THE MODS I LISTED, ESPECIALLY COUNTER-STRIKE 1.6 WHICH STILL HAS A LOYAL FANBASE 15 YEARS ON SO SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU RETARD.

Servers existing doesn't give something replay value. ET: The Extra-Terrestrial still functions exactly as it did on release. It just happens to have no replay value (or play value, but that's another matter). Counter-Strike 1.6 has never been free. Counter-Strike 1.4 was the last free release iirc, and that has no players left to my knowledge. Come to think of it, TFC was never free either. TF was free, but that was on Quake's engine. TFC was developed by Valve for a retail release.

&gt;What game that I listed immediately got abandoned?

DoD:S didn't last very long. I don't remember either Half-Life Deathmatch game having a particularly big following even in '98/'04. Sven Co-Op is just a co-op mode for HL1, as far as I can tell, which means that a big following doesn't make much sense.

I had sampled various Linux distros on and off back in middle school and early high school (~2000), but never liked the look and feel of them and so never got far enough in to appreciate what they could do.  I just happened to stumble across an article on elementary (not sure why), then ended up watching the LAS review of it on YouTube.  I had to try it (and forever more watch LAS).  It was Linux, but with minimal visuals right to my taste out-of-box.  Visual tastes differ, I know, and Linux can suit them all, but I needed that gateway drug and this was so it.

I've tried a few other distros (most notably Arch, which I love as well) since elementary got me hooked on Linux, but I find that the very first thing I do is try to adjust all the visuals to make it look and feel more like elementary, so I usually just end up going back."

Most primary schools here also teach three languages compulsorily - English, Hindi and the local language (if that is not Hindi. The states of India are primarily formed on a linguistic basis, with most of the states having an official language which is not Hindi - the national language).

I was further fortunate to grow up in states which were not the state where my ancestors are from. So I can actually converse in four languages (English, Hindi, my ancestor's state language - which is also my 'mother tongue', and the language of the state where I spent most of my childhood) - all without any conscious effort to learn (barring mandatory school stuff).

Through conscious effort of learning a language - I had previously picked up a wee bit of Mandarin and Spanish, both of which lie forgotten in my mind now. I am now focusing on learning German."

ThatCrankyGuy,gamedev,1389329831.0,"I know what you're saying. However, you must understand how distribution and the algorithms behind it actually work, before you can take a swing at this idea.

Being an engineer I think about the foundation of the idea. Here you're attempting to decentralize game data.

Others have said it better than I could, but there are some really glaring problems with this.

The amount of data that needs to be disseminated between clients is a lot and this distribution must be timely. That is a lot of speed required to shuttle this data. As the radius extends out from the node that is issuing the change, the propagation becomes slower and slower. Now imagine even 50 nodes issuing changes, that's a change storm that will overload the distributed grid. There also the concern about trust and verifying the change -- an untrusted party can introduce chaos if not validated.

I'm sure this could be a good research topic for a master's thesis and would probably work in the lab between 4-10 nodes, but out in the real world, this has no hope."

Tucking refers to hiding male genitalia, and packing refers to using prosthetics to mimic male genitalia. 

Hey, I'm glad discovering trams stuff makes you feel so happy. It's a good feeling, enjoy it. I didn't get that when I found out I was trams, but I did when I realized I was asexual. The joy and euphoria of *finally* understanding why I was the way I was, knowing there's a term and community for me, feeling relieved that I didn't have to pretend to be something I'm not. It felt awesome. 

Yeah, it is sucky about the transmisogyny in society. I got away with shopping in the mens section for years by simply saying I like the fit more. Would not have been so easy if I was MTF. I've been noticing gender differences and the subtle sexism that exists in society more and more since starting to transition. It really infuriates me. 

As for passing pre hormones, don't be completely discouraged. Some girls can pull it off fairly well. And even if you don't pass, you can still dress the way you wamt in private. You can start on your way without doing the medical stuff just yet, like I did.

secondly, i JUST got back from my very first bra fitting, and i, thankfully, had a better experience than you. i got fitted at the nordstroms in seattle and the gal who helped me was super super nice. i told her i thought i was probably a 36F and she asked if i'd like to be measured. so i had her measure me (with no clothes, obviously, even though she gave me the option of leaving my bra on) and all she measured was my underbust. 

she comes back with one bra, a 36FF (might've been a G, there were a lot of bras!) and it fits awesome! so she goes and finds a whole bunch of other stuff, and of the things she brought, only a few got discarded. one was just too tight, another had itchy lace on bottom. i ended up ordering a different color that was on sale of the one i liked that was also a good price ([this](https://em.nordstrom.com/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DWQpglLjHJlYQGuCJbGIkXyM1zbB1YKjBkpelrIvuWNECBPFN5VXtpKX%3DWSBYTS&amp;_ei_=EolaGGF4SNMvxFF7KucKuWP54ct_HbzyIMtbnPl6q3ya0KqHAbgh-1bpsHb23wmNeumEjTe_o28FQLLB4XFtTCK0aZqtDccP6ZBfY3wBMZ2iUaClYJYu_LiNPKImrTyptzRlQsR7RAIQb6f5BQRdfRX-82xNKQSdjNnkhI_nu8tczLCEf5xM4zIN7NVKaq-_8VKT97feP8F2ZphAQkjcu28AiQjak0wvrejHdEOdrVpsiO-J.)) also, if you order in store like that, they ship it to you for free!

she told me of all the people who say they've come in and measured themselves, i was the closest! i'm glad i learned!

it was pretty terrible to put my crappy VS bra back on though... "

ConstipatedNinja,bigdickproblems,1389330666.0,"In the US, the FDA regulates the sale of condoms to those produced from manufacturing processes following the ISO 4074 standard. Larger condoms cannot be made by machines fitting within these regulations due to size constraints, and thus many large condoms are illegal in the US. Sections 516, 518, 519, and 520(e) of the FFDCA allows the FDA to ban products, force manufacturers to make consumers aware of any potential hazards associated with their product, to force international companies to follow FDA guidelines when importing into the US, and to force - to the point of jail time - those who sell, distribute, or use products that are unsafe (see: not following exactly what the FDA calls safe). Basically, although someone could feasibly manufacture a large condom not in the US, they would risk jail time (actually an unknown amount) and you would risk jail time. Customs has the authority to confiscate anything illegal to own in the US, which includes this, because it's not made in the way that the FDA calls safe.

At customs, they check a lot of packages. They could see multiple millions of packages in a day, though, so they don't check nearly all of them. The ones that they do check, they evaluate if import fees are owed and they evaluate the legality of the package's contents. Since you can very feasibly be sent something illegal without wanting it, it is not a crime to have a package heading to you containing something illegal. As such, they write a threatening letter to you, effectively telling you to quit your shit. And that goes in a database. If it happens again, or if it happens a bunch of times, then there becomes a reasonable suspicion that you actually are doing something illegal. This is enough usually to get a warrant to check your premises. And usually if what they wanted to find turns up empty on a warrant, they will search to the limits of a warrant trying to find something to pin you with, since they don't like leaving empty-handed.

The owning specifically actually isn't illegal. Since it is not selling, distributing, or using them in any way, then you haven't broken FDA rules. If, however, they see a 10 pack with 8 condoms in it, then they know that you sold, distributed, or used some, which is illegal. Of course proving that you did would make for a hilarious court battle, but I think you get the point.

TL;DR: The FDA says large condoms are unsafe because they have to be made with machines that don't conform to standards (because they're larger), and the FDA is allowed to hand out jail time like candy to anyone who uses, sells, gives away, or moves anything that the FDA has called unsafe, so it's against the law in the sense that the penalty is jail time."

James_GAF,DebateaCommunist,1389331531.0,"Capitalism structurally alienates people from the ability to sustain their own lives by recognizing limitless monopoly over land and material in the form of absentee ownership. Patents, copyright, intellectual property follow from the same root monopoly concept of ownership. All done with little if any regard to generations that follow. The result a class society primarily composed of owners and their servants. 

Beyond that capitalism and monopoly distort human behavior as the necessity to live requires near universal participation less the populace resorts to wide spread violent revolution. The imperative to participate along with alienation from ones own means of survival creates a consumer cultural environment where the business of life is manipulating people into the pursuit of products that do little if anything for their life. 

Marketing, propaganda, public relations, whatever name you give it is largely the result of the imperative to participate in the system even for the basics of life. We would not choose to participate in these sociopathic corporations were our lives not entirely dependent on currency as we've lost the ability to sustain ourselves largely due to absentee ownership driving the consumer culture generation after generation. It's not that being a farmer would be the ideal life for everyone, but we barely even have that option anymore. The vast majority have to submit to a corporate master just to live.

For those reasons I oppose capitalism, though as a social democrat reformist I think capitalism can at least be tolerated a little bit when tempered heavily by a people responsive democracy."

If it wasn't so easy for the mind then it wouldn't be such a prevailing attitude.

* test the slime to see how well it'll flow down a surface, at an angle

* make sure you'll have a powerful enough motor to pump enough slime

* the slimes gonna get pretty gross and you can't filter it. bring loads of extra to replace the nasty stuff if theres going to be a lot of people in the waterfall

* dont break any electrical codes when you hook up the motor please 

* make sure the pipe is fairly large. losses in the flow will make work really hard for the pump if it has to work 8 feet up a skinny pipe.

Lodekim,spikes,1389334125.0,"It's worth trying, but in my early testing I'm finding that I rarely want to be playing the full out aggressive plan with this deck.  Sure, vs control everything is going to the face, but there are a lot of decks where you don't want more tap lands and pain from your lands.  Even vs mono black I'm finding that I want to be killing their pack rats and specters rather than going upside the head, frequently even their mutavaults.  Then the low creature count in the deck also means any deck with removal is going to kill it almost immediately, so you're not likely to recoup much life.  The taplands are not insignificant either.  They're great when you get a good mix, but 4 scry lands or 3 scry lands and a shock land is not an ideal first 4 lands.  Maybe not the worst, but it's not easy.

That said, you do frequently run out of gas in the deck and while it does topdeck fairly well in my opinion, an active DRS is just massive advantage.  Given how many games I've had that come down to the wire, that could be a lifesaver.

Summary?  I think it's worth a shot.  You basically want to look and see how many matchups are going to let it survive long enough to recoup from the more painful landbase."

siniminstx,WritingPrompts,1389334343.0,"The carriage bumped along the road through the wood, following an unkempt pathway that passed through two of the Queen’s villages. A particularly unseasonable rain had left the surface especially uneven and a large bump caused the two passengers to jerk forward. One swore, letting out the sentiment that both felt: “We do not get paid enough for these types of things, you know!”

“I vehemently agree, Darling, I simply am appalled at the tasks we’re now being assigned. It really isn’t fit for a lady such as yourself,” replied the second.

“Don’t call me ‘darling.’ Or a lady, for that matter. And quit talking like you’re His Majesty the Royal Postman. You’re a page, same as me, Godric. All this using words that nobody knows is *vehemouthly*--” she paused, raising her eyebrows, “annoying.”

“It’s actually--well, nevermind.”

They rode together in silence for a few minutes before Godric attempted to rekindle the conversation.

“You did remember the signs, didn’t you?”

“Ugh! You and your questions! Of course I remembered the signs, that’s the whole reason we’ve come out here, now isn’t it?” She scoffed. “Did I remember the signs, wot a laugh.”

“Mildred, you needn’t be so abrupt. It’s really quite unbecoming,” Godric attempted a stern tone of voice to show his seriousness. Mildred looked at Godric and smiled, slapping him on the shoulder a couple of times.

“Aw, fanks, Goddie! That’s more the spirit, eh?” She sat back and Godric stared at her momentarily before returning to looking straight ahead.

They approached the first town and stopped once they reached the market center. Mildred leaped off the wagon before it stopped, splashing mud on her already filthy dress. She wiped her hands on the front, sniffed loudly, and surveyed the area with her feet apart and hands on her hips.

“Welp,” she called to Godric as the carriage stopped, “Me finks we should just put it up right there under that bunch of rock.” She pointed towards the center of the square. Godric, who was retrieving the supplies from the wagon, turned to look.

“Dear Mildred, you don’t mean the statue, do you?” He looked back at her quizzically. She squinted with her mouth open and took two steps closer.

“Oh is that wot that is?” She laughed. “Ha! I would’ve thought it a block of rock. Ha! I did find it a bit odd to just have some rock in the middle.” Being a few feet away from each other, Godric was unable to hear Mildred’s ramblings and called back accordingly.

“I *said*, WOULDN’T THE TOWN BE ODD FOR HAVING JUST ROCK IN THE MIDDLE THERE?” She called back to him much louder than necessary. The peasants in the town frowned in her direction. Godric had finally managed to gather in his arms the supplies to post the sign. They were heavy, so without assistance he was left to stumble towards Mildred. He finally dropped the supplies at her feet, breathing heavily. Standing straight, he adjusted his tunic.

“Even though it’s a statue, rather than just rocks as I once supposed it to be, do you fink we should ought to...post the sign on it anyway?” Mildred asked, still squinting at the statue. Godric laughed, supposing her to be joking. With no response, he did a double take and turned toward her.

“You can’t be serious, surely.”

“No! Of course I am! I mean, look at it! He’s not even wearing knickers, ‘ardly anyfing at all, with only a little rock-blanket fing coming out of his hip there, see?” She waved in the general direction of the statue’s groin area. Godric’s mouth was open in bewilderment.

“Mildred. It’s art. You cannot simply cover up art!” At this comment, Mildred thought for a moment, nodding and giving lots of *hmm*s.

“Well, I fink *this* is art!” She grinned and picked up the sign, looking from it back to Godric a couple of times.

“It’s just a sign.”

“Yes, yes,” she said, putting it down thoughtfully. “Speaking of this sign that you had previously mentioned and brought up as it were, wot, erm...wot’s it say, Goddie?” Godric puffed his chest for a moment and grinned, internally congratulating himself for having his talents recognized.

“It says: WANTED: LIVE DRAGON. NO BOUNTY FOR CORPSES.” Smiling, he sighed, proud of his efforts. Mildred looked at him blankly. Godric, mildly perturbed at her apparent lack of understanding, repeated himself. “WANTED: LIVE DRAGON. NO BOUNTY FOR CORPSES.”

Mildred still gazed mindlessly at Godric, who began to feel quite flustered.

“Well that doesn’t make very much sense, does it?” She began to laugh. Godric was fully offended at the moment, taking her misunderstanding quite personally, and demanded an explanation.

“Well, if they’re asking for a dragon, wot’s a copse got to do wiffit?” She continued laughing.

“A copse? What--I said *corpse*.” He enunciated the word quite dramatically, hoping to quell her confusion, but she just shook her head in amazement.

“Them government officials were supposed to be the educated lot! Ha! A bounty for a group of trees? Wot a laugh!” A snort escaped, which surprised her at first, then seemed to intensify her chortling. Godric stomped his foot.

“How are we misunderstanding each other? It says ‘NO BOUNTY FOR CORPSES,’ as in *dead* dragons! No money for dead dragons, Mildred! It says nothing of copses! CORPSES!”

Mildred suddenly stopped laughing and gasped. “Wait a moment!” She rushed up to Godric and grasped his arms with her hands. He stood there tensely as she breathed in his face for a good couple inhales before speaking again. “Are you telling me ‘corpse’ means dead body?”

“Yes, Mildred! Yes! How on earth you could possibly not *know* that, yet know the word *copse* is, quite frankly,” he laughed, “beyond my comprehension!” Mildred dropped her hands and began pacing, tapping her chin.

“Do you fink,” she began, stopping directly in front of Godric, “that when my sister told me to burn the ‘corpse,’ that she really meant for me to light me mum up rather than the neighbor’s trees?”

“...that would be my first guess, mhmm.” Godric simply was at a loss for words at this point and responded as rationally as he could. The two stared at each other for a moment more, before a peasant walked up and pointed at the sign.

“Wots ‘at say?”

Mildred jumped and answered the peasant with much fervor: “It says you’ve got to catch the dragon wiv his ‘eart still beating and you won’t get any money for burning down the trees!”

Looking at a stunned Godric, she added with a nod, “it’s important so that he doesn’t become confused like I previously had done before.”"

I partake about once a week, and find that this frequency of use prevents it from cheapening my sober experience to a great degree. There is something to be said however for the fact that its hard to reliably recreate while sober the depth of pleasure which is always experienced while high. Always remember that it is possible however, and never use cannabis (or any substance for that matter) to attempt to create an experience which can never be recreated while sober. Also, refrain from using psychotropic substances of any kind to deal with emotional pain or stress, as this will only exacerbate your problems once you come back down.

I hope this helps. I think you'll be fine, judging by the level of maturity you're displaying by making sure you know what you're getting into before trying this."

vorpalblab,AskMen,1389334744.0,"Practical Pig here:

I am 70 years old (OK 70 years on Feb 1) and had a marriage that lasted 24 years from 30 to 54.  Then another relationship took me from age 58 to 63. Now I am in my third and it will prolly last til one or the other of us falls off the perch.

X1 cheated on me and was difficult to live with for ten years before I finally pulled the pin and checked out. The separation was more fair to her than me, but hey at least there were no kids to support and a low legal bill. A bigger fight would net the same from the smoking ruin with more to the lawyers.

I was practical more than retributive then and am still.

Shopping for a new relationship after my marriage was in separation hell, was an eyeopener to the various shorthand words women use online to hide discouraging features.

Also starting around 45 it is a 'buyers market' for men and a increasingly difficult one for women over 45.

By 70 there are ten women for every guy with a pulse.

Lotsa women would love some hunk ten years under their age, but what they get offered are portly bald dudes up to 20 years older than them looking for a nurse with a purse.

Guys with decent income and looking pretty good are the wet dream of a much bigger pool of experienced divorced women with or without jobs, careers, kids.

x2 basically recruited me (she was 6 yrs younger than me.) and used me to set up a better retirement scheme for her. She failed, and I am outta that nonsense.

My current squeeze is as well off as I am and looks great, we are planning a fine time economically spending time in the country, Europe or Asia from time to time.

Quite possibly your current wife has had a chat with a few realistic people and knows this news too.

Think hard on what was going down before the Big Split News. And what you bring to the table with a whole new attitude and cheerfulness.

daisyismydog,Indiemakeupandmore,1389334762.0,"From what I know of the Stila foils (haven't used them myself, just seen reviews on /r/makeupaddiction!) what makes them unique is the metallic/foiled finish. I just checked out [this blog post](http://www.xsparkage.com/stila-magnificent-metals-foil-finish-eye-shadows-is-it-worth-it/) reviewing them, and read this about the application method:  

&gt; Applying these is weird- you’re supposed to put a drop of the liquid into the mixing tray, then mix in some of the pigment to create a paste. The shadow itself is a weird consistency too, its not a pressed eyeshadow or a loose pigment.. its almost moldable, if that makes sense, but is still flaky. It’s also weird to getting the right consistency when mixing with the liquid, as its easy to use too much liquid and then it applies uneven, or too much shadow which is harder to apply.  

These qualms with Stila's shadows seem to echo the ones that were brought up in the discussion about Fyrinnae (needing a mixing medium being similar to pixie epoxy, applying unevenly). I'm guessing if you tried applying some of the more metallic (e.g. Gilded Wings, Shenanigans, etc.) wet, mixed in with another medium, or with pixie epoxy you'd be able to get a similar finish. I just checked out some of the metallic shades off of Fyrinnae's website and they actually have some swatches of about what I'm talking about for [Pumpkinfire](http://www.fyrinnae.com/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=427). 

I'd be interested in seeing some comparisons between Stila's and Fyrinnae's shadow applied in the same pre-mixed manner! If they do give satisfactorily similar finishes, then Fyrinnae conveniently organizes their offerings by color and [here](http://www.fyrinnae.com/index.php?_a=viewCat&amp;catId=26) are their golds, coppers, and silvers, and [these](http://www.fyrinnae.com/index.php?_a=viewCat&amp;catId=44) are their brightest ones.

I think it's pretty cool that they are trying to look for feedback from Westerners to create more content specific to the market. Whether this is core games or not, it's pretty interesting to watch it develop as various people/companies take their stab at cracking the market. (including [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1u6m3n/silicon_sisters_talk_about_making_everlove_a/) Western [ones](http://www.hanakogames.com/))

That said, looking at the success of The Walking Dead I kinda wonder if westerners are more likely to prefer interactive movies to interactive novels, which of course makes life a lot harder since those are a lot more expensive to produce. I think there is some target group overlap with Hidden Object games who a decent amount of time have some sort of romance element as well, but they are a lot more goal oriented (plus I come across more where the romance is like in the side story, like the villain having a tragic romance backstory or the person you rescue, but I have come across plenty where you get with the person you save of where saving the person you love is the basic setup). 

Personally, so far romance visual novels haven't really interested me much, I mean outside of the greatly recommended ones like To The Moon (and well: Long Live The Queen, even though that isn't a romantic one :p). That said, I'm glad they exist, because I can easily picture that they would have been way more fun to me when back when I was a teenager."

* Sight unseen, Michael Caine just randomly offers to fund a nation-spanning magic tour for four unknown street artists.

* Magic isn't real. Wait, maybe it is. Now it's not again. But we're still not going to bother explaining ANY of it to you.

* ""Okay, I have an elaborate plan for revenge against these people who fucked me over, and it involves me working my way up the FBI food chain and getting this specific job in this specific office, but it all depends on whether I happen to be randomly assigned the case.""

* ""Hey, Melanie Laurent, I'm going to be a complete asshole while you inexplicably fall in love with me because reasons.""

* So, Woody Harrelson can completely totally hypnotize people just by whispering in their ears for like half a second. HOW IS HE NOT KING OF THE WORLD?

* Like, at that point, what do you need the rest of them for?

* I mean, shit, what fucking purpose did Dave Franco serve?

* Anyway, consider how elaborate the Woody-Harrelson-as-fake-bus-driver-with-a-car-attached-to-the-front-of-the-bus thing ended up being, all because Dave Franco needed to fake his death, after Mark Ruffalo ACTUALLY ALMOST FUCKING KILLED HIM. They end up being on the same side, sure, but both guys could have very seriously died in that fight.

* Oh, and mirrors. Because this entire plan goes to shit if someone walks more than halfway into the vault. We better just assume they won't, for some reason. And good thing nobody ever sticks around to take evidence from WHAT THEY KNEW WAS AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE OR ANYTHING.

* Right, they were following the plans laid out by the Eye of Horus or whatever. But at no point in the magical hologram did any of them seem to have a problem with literally stealing millions of dollars? From people they had no reason to think had done anything wrong? And then go on the run after committing literally hundreds more crimes AND GETTING DAVE FRANCO LEGALLY DECLARED DEAD? 

* So, the Eye. What the hell is the point of it? And why the hell does Dave Franco get invited?

* Morgan Freeman is going to get off, like, five minutes later when the entire case against him falls apart. Was it really worth it, Ruffalo?

* I mean, seriously, a 30-year vendetta? Your dad was a shit magician. Suck it up, you little bitch.

I kept everything bar the suits and the fancy dress shirts. If you're that attached to your old shirts but still want a more feminine edge, cut up the sides and lace them up.

Much of my more masculine stuff that I kept like my vast array of combat trousers, I now combine with crop tops. Any tops that look too big, I make them look bigger with skinny jeans and sky-high pumps. Even my military look jackets I still pull off by wearing them with my party dresses.

It's all about balancing things out.

EDIT: as for vocals, I suggest listening to Arch Enemy. Just take better care of your throat and aim for a higher register when screaming. One exercise I do is starting off a scream in my lower range then going higher while still keeping that scream going, using the air I took to get the low growl into the higher, almost breathier scream. Then slowly reduce the time you're in the low growl to the point where you're only there for half a second before going into your scream."

They meet an extremely beautiful woman. Muhammed's brother will not stop staring at this woman, so Muhammed turns his brother's face away from her.

red5711,Warhammer40k,1389338586.0,"Looks like GW doesn't feel like selling Pyrovores this edition either. Was really hoping for Torrent on their guns so I can actually field them for once. We're also being robbed any sort of Skyfire short of a FMC (I'm looking at you, Impaler Cannons).

It also seems that they hit Tervigons really hard, too. People fielded them a lot in the 5th Ed Codex since a good 50% of models in the book were nigh-unplayable. Tervigons were a very good unit. Taking move/charge away from baby Termagants and doubling the size of the Synapse Backlash really makes me hesitate about taking Tervigons in this book. Also, taking away the fact that Tervigons can accept/issue challenges is very irritating.

Warriors still being toughness 4 with no visible way to give them Eternal Warrior or T5. Also; where are my Ymgarls?

Does GW hate assaulting armies so much that they'll take away any sort of decent gapclosers? No pods? No Ymgarls? Mawlocs mishap? Newborn Termagants are severely limited? Way too much T4 for an army that gets gunned down before they even get in range to shoot back, and forget about assaulting with them. But don't worry! We can have Night Vision! WOOHOO! When will that be relevant? Rarely, if ever.

eighthgear,anime,1389338604.0,"9700 is quite good for what OreGairu is. A lot of the shows that did stupendously well were either adaptations of insanely popular source material (Shingeki no Kyojin) or series that are a part of well-established/popular franchises (Prince-sama 2, Yamato 2199, Railgun S, Oreimo 2).

Light novel &amp; dvd bundles of Oregairu actually sold out really quickly in Akihabara, and the LNs in general have been very popular. Right now, there is not enough material for a sequel, but the author seems to be writing at a pretty good pace.

With things like OreGairu, it is really more of an issue of whether the publisher wants more anime to promote their series rather than it being an issue of whether there was enough DVD/BD sales to make a profit. I mean, we got three seasons and a bunch of OVAs of The World God Only Knows, despite the fact that its sales were consistently in the 1k-2k range every season. That is sort of an extreme example, but it does show that sales alone don't determine whether a sequel will occur or not. It certainly doesn't hurt OreGairu's chances that it happened to easily sell well enough to make a substantial return."

However, since you brought it up, I never once condoned the actions of the man, not did I say they were okay. I said that the OP shouldn't throw around terms like ""pathological,"" when it's very likely he did not have a mental disability. Most people don't just up and decide to make an online profile when they are married. Even fewer respond as relatively maturely as that man did when he was caught. My point, as I'll state again, was that people should be careful throwing around mental illness, because it does a disservice for those who DO actually suffer. 

Bringing this back around to my main point. Your exact response to me is part of the problem. You went looking through my history trying to find something, and you had blinders on while you we're reading. It's obvious I never condoned his behavior or tried to make excuses, but whenever someone brings something up from the other persons perspective, most people in the sub view it through their blinders and completely miss the point of the post or get angry.

Secret_Wizard,AskReddit,1389339256.0,"Both of the major Half-Life games (Half-Life &amp; Half-Life 2 and its episodes) are renowned as being among the greatest of video games. They sit right atop Mount Video-Game-Olympus alongside greats like Deus Ex, Final Fantasy VII, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Doom, Dark Souls, and others in a pantheon of universally beloved games.

Half-Life's greatness is probably hard to see for someone who didn't play them when they came out. It's like a case of ""Seinfeld isn't funny"" or ""Superman is bland"". Half-Life pioneered realistic physics in games, facial animations (which still hold up great today), and big set-piece moments such as buildings collapsing or colossal events happening in the far distance. When Half-Life 2 came out, it was mind-exploding how revolutionary it was. Now, it's hard for anyone to see anything special about it because the market has been flooded with games doing the same things Half-Life 2 introduced.


In addition, Episode 2 of Half-Life 2 (the most recent game of the series) ended on a pretty big cliff-hanger. And by ""pretty big"" I mean ""HOLY SHIT, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!? GIMME NOW PLS VALVE""... The story of the series is just as great as the gameplay; it all just really sucks you in and doesn't let you go 'till the credits roll. The mysterious character known only as ""The G-Man"" is perhaps one of the most discussed and theorized characters in all of gaming.

Playing Half-Life is like eating a tasty-ass steak and lobster dinner. It is divine. People want more. The last game ended on a big cliff-hanger. People want to see what happens next. That's all there really is to it, I guess."

It's one of the biggest drawbacks i can think of when it comes to bitcoin... it accidentally spawned a vast network of what are basically crypto crackers. I wouldn't be surprised if say, ghash.io has more computational power than the NSA itself. If you went with SHA for hashing, it's basically a big painted target for unscrupulous bitcoin miners."

Well, if you sometimes think about guys **in that way** then you're probably *at least* bisexual. And I'll be honest, you sound a bit repressed to me. Homophobia doesn't mean you have to hate gay people and throw rocks at them in the streets, it just has to be a negative image of it that you've internalized. When you say things like you wouldn't act on your attraction because you think it's against some imaginary ""societal rules"" and that ""it just isn't done"", that screams repression to me.

And this:
&gt;I've definitely had thoughts about guys, literally every now and then but I've never acted on them.

Anyway, back to the question at hand:

Honestly for most people on HRT attraction doesn't change that much if any. Most of the changes have to do with people being more open and honest about their own sexuality. Also if you love someone pre-hrt, you'll still love them after, but issues can come up if your partner is not attracted to the gender you are transitioning to."

Both are ridiculous, but I take more issue with the latter. The first ballot thing was created by the writers and if someone were to somehow get into the hall that wasn't ""first ballot material"" then they'd start talking about and make a select group of people who got over 90 % on the first ballot. The problem is the HoF is a whole. It's people who excelled at the game, no matter if it takes them 1 year or 15 years to get in. The writers try to make special groups inside a special group, and that isn't needed. It's the Hall of Fame and there's no need for the ""Hall of First Ballots"" or the ""Hall of the PED era."" If they deserve to be in the Hall, like a lot of the guys on the ballot this year did, vote for them. If they played during the steroid era and have no links to PED's, like Biggio, vote for them. If they played during the Steroid era and have links to things but they aren't confirmed, think about it and decide as you may. But the BWAA is nothing of logical thinking like that. It's just a bunch of guys that have written about baseball for 10+ years, which by no means means they have any more clue that the average fan about who should be in the HoF.

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1389342572.0,"Unfortunately most people are like that, not just with success but everything. Instead of letting people simply live their lives a lot of people will simply try to pull others down because they get higher up relative to the others. The easiest explanation to swallow is that these are just bad people and they're rare but that's not the case, they're everywhere and common and the explanation is simple, empathy (though if psychology advances things then it won't be a single word but still two concepts). There is affective empathy, the ability to respond to the emotions of others (this is theorized to be a result of emotional contagion but outside of certain groups there is more evidence that emotional contagion doesn't exist). This would be expected to be common but in practice seems to be rare, people are often selfish and provably will often act in ways that detriment others with no direct gain for themselves. There is also cognitive empathy which is the ability to understand another's emotional state. People readily show this even when they are simply taking pleasure in another's pain. People confuse the ideas, they recognize that they understand another person and believe they feel for them in fact many would go so far as to thinking they feel because of them. By confusing these ideas they hurt one another but still feel as if they're good people, they write off the pain they cause others as being random chance or even deserved for some reason. Most think they're doing good and see nothing else, cognitive dissonance is a powerful influence. People have figured this out and abused it, people have billed their sadism as research and treatment that helps others."

laefil,MensRights,1389343169.0,"what you probably expect: ""OMG WTF MANPIGS THIS WOMAN IS CLEARLY MISLED AND DOESNT UNDERSTAND THE BIGGER PICTURE OF THINGS BLAH BALH BALH"" ad infinitum.

i don't think feminism is about disrespecting men, demonising them, or ""empowering"" women to a point where they are faultless, blameless, etc. there are plenty of things men go through from the time that they are born to shape their perspective into warped ideas of masculinity and virility: a man must do x, y, and z to be a man, including t, w, and p.

now, when you take it into perspective that every person, man and woman, is sociologically conditioned to believe in assigned gender roles and superiority/inferiority complexes, there's a problem. hell, **(in many places) we live in a world where the wealthy are prioritised more than the poor**--if you are wealthy, it doesn't matter what kind of person you are, people will have more respect for you because of your status.

so when you apply this perspective to the sexes, and when it is acknowledged that we live in a **patriarchal society** (meaning, men are the breadwinners, men are/were conventionally the ones who were educated, or soldiers, or the shoulders of economy and politics), what do you think is the sociological perspective of woman, the counterpart to man?

**the woman in OP's post is clearly empowered--maybe she doesn't ""believe"" in what she thinks feminism embodies, but i doubt she would let anyone (man or woman) derail her for her capacities, whatever they are. THAT is what feminism is about.** it's a human endeavour and a social question. it isn't about ""the feminine vs. the masculine"": it's more about, ""why is it a problem to simply be an empowered human? what is it with these gender roles? why do we have to submit to what should be a stereotypical man or woman?""

in the end, it goes way beyond ""abusive mother takes children away from great dad in divorce ruling"" or ""woman does sexual favours for her male boss to get a raise"". it goes to the very root of those issues and addresses the psychological chaos of what it means to be a human in a world where humans have ""roles"", ""cliques"", ""competitions"", ""rules"", ""rejections"", ""judgements"", ""hierarchies"", etc.

well there you go. that is my feminist rebuttal."

The actiony bits seem too tacked on to really mesh with the rest of the story - sort of a ""oh shit, it's almost the end of the novel, we need to mecha conflict STAT"" feeling.

Honestly, though, I prefer DxD to IS - the former seemed really stupid, but more coherent and the plotlines didn't feel ""tacked on"" (to say nothing about the actual plot itself.) I'd give DxD maybe a 4-5, while IS would be a 3, at best."

NahDudeFkThat,seduction,1389343261.0,"&gt;And as a girl, I can say that a big reason I say no a lot of times when asked out is that I don't have enough information.

This is false. The reason you say ""no"" is because there isn't enough SOLID attraction and/or rapport built. Things you hardly ever can build online.



The bottom line is, facebook is not for the high value Man. Everything you described is just weird and can be interpreted as creepy to some. Also, only works on low quality girls. Hot girls are damn near impossible to successfully woo online.

Hot women strictly use online dating/Facebook for attention and validation. You may catch her attention for a few, but via the internet you are not going to pierce through the giant wall of thirsty manboobs who worship her every second of the day. She has too much ''options'' and fun to narrow her focus on just you, plus you have no way of making any **real** impact over the net. Now in person, assuming you got your shit together, your raw masculinity is able to smash the walls (that's what she said) with your raw masculine bulldozer and you can lock her down, but online you simply can't.

The best advice is to get off your lazy ass OP, start meeting hot girls IN REAL LIFE either through hobbies you have or otherwise, and delete your facebook (or at least abandon that shit). There are dozens of resources here I can say truly work, and my quality of life and women have skyrocketed effortlessly thanks to those resources.

PlushieChomby,relationships,1389343631.0,"First of all, kudos to you for dropping weight, cleaning up, and building up the courage to go full force into the dating world! 

Secondly, don't stress yourself out over this: every date, good and bad, is either practice or a lesson - you'll learn as you go what works for you and others and what doesn't. 

How do you break it off if it doesn't work out? If there's only been one date, you're under no obligation to call or contact the person, either for another date or to explain why you don't want to see them again. Good God please don't write someone a lengthy explanation of why you don't want to see them again after just one date; it'll come off as insulting. If they contact you and ask if you're interested when you've decided you're not, it's always polite to let them know that while you had a great time, you didn't feel the compatibility with them that you think both of you deserve; wish them good luck and that's that. But again, you're under no obligation to do so - happens all the time. 

Potential Pointers: 

* Think of a few open-ended questions for each date before going out with them. You've got access to their profiles, and there must be things of interest in there, or things they've casually mentioned in conversations, or just random things that haven't come up at all about which you're wondering. 

* Identify, if you can, their passions. If you can't, flat out ask them what they're passionate about. Almost everybody's got something if not several things they care about, and if you show an interest in at least finding out if not learning about those things, that can both add levels of comfortable familiarity to the date as well as prevent some awkward silences. 

* Stay away from politics and potential hot button topics, unless you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're on the same page and will agree with each other. I've known people with decades of happy marriage under their belts who had opposing political views and religious beliefs, and I've known a good deal of people who've had a first to fifth date turn into a malicious spat because of their opposing viewpoints. Time and a place for everything, doncha know. Dealbreakers will reveal themselves in time, people change, people soften up to others and become more understanding of differences when they're comfortable and care about the person holding the differing opinion. That said, some people *don't* change, or have political/religious dealbreakers, and if you're in that category, there's no point in wasting your time on someone who isn't likeminded - though I'd hope if you *are* in that category, it's something you've scoped out and cleared prior to going on a date with someone. 

* Meals are great, activities are better. If you decide to start doing dinner-and-a-movie dates, please for the love of God go to see the movie first so you'll have something to talk about over dinner if all else  fails. One of the best dates I've ever been on was with a guy who read in my profile that I like flying kites (thrown in as a half-long-walks-on-the-beach-kinda-joke); he had me meet him at a big park downtown where he was waiting with a picnic lunch, six pack of beer and two kites for us to fly. Gave him points for creativity and switching up the standard first date template. Maybe ask if they'd like to go for... oh shit it's winter isn't it? That means it's probably cold where you are. Welp, in spring, summer and fall ask after the meal if they'd maybe like to go for a walk in a park or visit a botanical garden or petting zoo or something - try to play to their interests. In winter... I guess if you like how the meal went and there's an activity you can do nearby that you think she'll be interested in, casually suggest it, (""I've had such a great time with you tonight/this afternoon, I was wondering if you'd like to go to/do/insert-activity-here"") and actively listen to what she says. 

* Keep in mind that people are totally different creatures from one another. Sure no one's a unique snowflake, but we're almost all unique conglomerations of ideas, experiences, thought patterns, desires and behaviors. If you're not sure where you stand, by all means find out at the end of the date but not in an interrogating way. A lot of figuring out dating is going to be reading people and learning what they're not saying directly - you'll get there in time. A good way to gauge how things went with someone you'd like to see again would be to say something like, ""Well I've had a really great time with you. Maybe next week we could blankity blank blank."" or ""This was a lot of fun; we should do it again sometime, maybe next time at blank."" Give an actual pause where you wait for them to say something. Watch their body language. Listen to their tone and word choice. Match it up to their personality and interpret but don't overanalyze. Don't ask a ton of questions about how they feel the date went, or go into a long spiel about how you've never had a girlfriend and are just now getting into dating. The right woman will learn all of this in time and not only accept it graciously but guide you through the steps toward a relationship. 

Basically do what comes natural, unless you think a third party would find it creepy. I'm a woman and I have to occasionally fight off a creepy instinct in the early stages of dating. Things people will eventually deem endearing, but you've gotta wait until you're there. 

* Last but not least, if someone's not returning your messages, or hasn't returned two or three of your phone calls spaced out over two or three days, drop them like a hot sack of potatoes and move on to greener pastures. It doesn't matter if you thought the date went great, if they *said* the date went great. People who play games while dating others are not the people you want to date, especially when you're first starting out. Hell, I'm a decade and a half in and I still don't return calls of guys who do the ""wait three days to call"" or PUA bullshit. Then again, I lose interest quickly if a guy sends me five texts an hour for ten hours a day, too. 

The bottom line is, there are lots of different types of daters and boundaries/turnons/turnoffs, you'll learn as you go, and I've typed out a goddamned essay already, so kudos to you if you made it through it. Feel free to bookmark my username and PM me if you have any other questions. I've actually walked a handful of friends in similar situations to yours through an intro to the dating world, and even gone on practice dates... whiiiiiiiich makes me wish I was writing this at a time that wasn't three in the morning because I'm sure I could've done better, more concisely, and actually had the brainpower to re-read and edit what I've written.

Spoiler: Not gonna happen, and you *need* to let it go. 

I didn't know that ""narcissist"" was the term for what was going on with my mother back then, but my biggest ""I am not like *you*"" moment was realizing that we just *can't* let one incident over all of ten bucks ruin an entire friendship, especially when we refuse to tell our friend exactly how and why it was so inconvenient... And for just one second, pretend you had a normal family... This happens, your parents wouldn't have made a huge deal of it, might've given you a little shit, but not much... And your friend presumably didn't know that that you did not, in fact, have a normal family.

And while it's kinda shitty that she cancelled and such, it is completely not her fault that your parents would/could overreact to something like that. 

I feel like maybe you're misplacing a lot of anger at this friend, when ultimately, maybe you're really mad at yourself for any number of things, including not having said a firm and solid no. Inability/difficulty to say no when we want to is kind of a thing for us. 

Ultimately, no, it's not entirely your fault, but it is important to recognize *exactly* what is going on in any given situation, especially for us, because insight is often one of the only things that separates us from our N's after a lifetime of negative programming, and it's about our only hope of escaping that cycle permanently, especially for those of us inclined towards some N qualities ourselves. 

As much damage as my N has done, ultimately, I'm far more scared of myself, and the damage I could do... Because really, who wants to live like they do, seeing everyone as potentially hostile currency; *as just like they are*?"

Have trouble eating toast for breakfast? Eat it for lunch when your appetite returns - switch things around, but make sure you hit those macros. "

JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1389345157.0,"Depends heavily on it's specifics. The human body is exceedingly fragile and our sense of direction isn't all that great (at least in the grand scheme of things) even with points of reference. You'd be almost guaranteed to get lost, and most of the world isn't all that habitable. You wouldn't be able to go all that fast without risking bodily harm due to the speed itself add to that issues of breathable atmosphere (limiting height) and collisions (at high enough speeds a water droplet can do as much damage as a bullet). Even if you found ways around all that you'd still need to worry about storms as they are far more common at higher altitudes, you can have random lightning strikes within a cloud. You'd also have to consider all of the social and governmental issues. Imagine that some government found out that somebody had superpowers of some sort, how long until they're made to vanish or simply coerced into doing that parties bidding. The only way I can really see to circumvent that is to publicize the abilities or totally ignore them, the former would have all sorts of consequences from worship (there would be cults, there are always cult-like followers of people of any level of fame) to corporate coercion to get endorsements and the latter would probably feel like a waste. Superpowers suck even if you can mitigate the negatives inherent of any given power since they are so unusual and in most cases useful that there is no way they wouldn't change things radically, you don't want to be at the heart of radicle change. If that weren't the case then superpowers wouldn't be some great thing because they would be common, then you'd be dealing with issues of class based on one's power and how capable they were with it. That being said would I be willing to risk it for the right power set (with the proper immunities), yeah but I wouldn't settle for something so simple as flight since having the power itself would put me in danger and there would be all sorts of caveats to keep certain things under conscious control. Keep in mind that there are people with what could best be considered super powers, the problem is that since our world is full of disappointments with really cool things they're always inherently shitty ones (empathy and super senses are a good example, they're a matched set most of the time even if the intensity varies) due to a number of factors. It's not the sort of stuff people advertise because it simply isn't that interesting some people are insanely flexible, some can identify and match any note, some can reproduce works of art perfectly from a single exposure, some people never forget. Our world is honestly amazing enough without any more nigh impossibilities, all one needs to see it is a touch of sonder, a bit of curiosity, and a lot of imagination. Every life is an epic, one only need see it."

BonzoTheBoss,AdviceAnimals,1389345339.0,"I don't think *anyone* in this thread has said that it's a black and white issue, just that education and the solidification of healthy eating habits after a life time of bad ones doesn't happen overnight, and is harder than some people spouting ""LOL JUST STOP EATING"" might think.

I'm struggling with my weight right now. People say I don't look overweight (maybe they're just being kind, probably), but sticking to the strict BMI, I'm technically obese. When I get stressed, I eat. This behaviour formed at an early age. I could blame my mother for how she raised me and molded my eating habits, but I'm an adult now and need to take responsibility. Okay, so I try and watch what I eat. So far so good. 

But then something unexpected happens and my stress levels spike, and suddenly that chocolate in the cupboard I got given for Christmas is looking mighty tempting... I know it's bad for me. I know it even as I eat it that I'm a terrible, fat loser and deserve to be fat if I can't even prevent myself from eating this chocolate, which just makes me feel worse... well you can see how the cycle continues. 

Obviously I need to find a healthier way of dealing with stress, but self esteem issues don't help either. Not one person in this thread is saying people don't have to take responsibility for their weight, just that ""fat shaming"" isn't helpful, because believe me, we're ashamed enough as it is."

23skiddsy,AskMen,1389346403.0,"I've always noticed how manhood is earned, while womanhood is generally ""given"" (often with starting to menstruate). Rites of Passage were common worldwide - and in some places, still are, just not as necessarily ""ritualized"" (For instance, losing your virginity as a man is treated as a form of a rite of passage). This hasn't ever been my experience as a woman. Manhood requires some sort of hazing, where womanhood doesn't. 

Manhood is something earned and taken away, and having it taken away can put you at risk: physically, emotionally, etc. Trans people don't like being misgendered, and it's similarly uncomfortable for men to take their ""manhood"" away. This can come in many forms - be it homophobic slurs, words like ""pussy"", or grow some balls, etc. It's all about de-gendering men. 

Men in western society may not have to jump over a cow to prove they are men (as one rite in Africa does - and if men fail, they will never get a wife), but there are similar social hurdles to keep ""man"" status even in the western world. "

What you could do instead is reserve a corner of a room or a box for stuff you need to ask her about. Collect the things in there and then, when you are done with that room, ask her about all things at once.

Preferably bring this up during a moment you are together, like dinner or in the car, and make an appointment! This way she can work it into her day and it doesn't come at a moment when she expects she can go into her daily routine.

23skiddsy,AskMen,1389346948.0,"It's actually more of a biological reality than it is a socially constructed one. As humans we can overcome the bias pushed onto us by evolution, but we have to examine where it comes from.

Male animals are expendable, because they do not have the reproductive investment that females do (There are situations where this is reversed: Seahorses and Jacanas spring to mind, where males are primarily responsible for parental care), and generally reproductive capabilities are limited by the number of females, not the number of males. Males are thus used as ""defenders"" in many species - the stallion of a herd of horses protects the mares and foals at significant risk to himself because he is less valuable, in an EVOLUTIONARY sense.

It's not about being ""lesser"", it's about being expendable and that putting your life at risk is better than putting a woman's or child's life at risk. In species where we see males with more reproductive investment and are the limiting factor for reproduction, females tend to be the 'defenders' and put themselves at more risk. 

And while all this is biologically constructed, we as humans can look past that and treat each other as equally valuable. Or we should. Especially given we're not going to near extinction any time soon.

Granted, I've never experienced people saying things like that to me, as a woman myself. But I'm hardly standard - the only time I've been catcalled was by a gang of girls intending to mock my appearance and intimidate me. Anecdotes are anecdotes, in the end."

* [**Chuunibyou S2**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18671/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai!_Ren) - loved the first season, so why wouldn't I watch the second? 

* [**Mikakunin de Shinkoukei**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20541/Mikakunin_de_Shinkoukei) - the first episode was very funny. If you like Doga Kobo slice of life (think YuruYuri, Love Lab, and GJ-bu), this is for you. [My review of the first episode.](http://faultyreviews.wordpress.com/2014/01/09/mikakunin-de-shinkoukei-01/)

* [**Tonari no Seki-kun**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18139/Tonari_no_Seki-kun) - also very funny, and quite unique. At around 8 minutes per episode, it isn't much of a time commitment, yet is long enough to not feel needlessly short. [My review of the first episode.](http://faultyreviews.wordpress.com/2014/01/05/tonari-no-seki-kun-01/)

* [**Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19117/Toaru_Hikuushi_e_no_Koiuta) - I've watched the movie that this is a spin-off series of, and enjoyed it. The show has the potential to be a good romance/adventure story, and I'm a sucker for aerial combat scenes.

* [**Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha.**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20457/Inari_Konkon_Koi_Iroha.) - the first episode doesn't air till next week, but I've read a good chunk of the manga, and I really enjoyed it. I like romcoms, and this can definitely be a very good one.

* [**Onee-chan ga Kita**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20931/Onee-chan_ga_Kita) - a good example of why not to judge a work by its title. I watched the first episode, because it is only a couple of minutes. I expected it to just be a bunch of incest fanservice. Instead, it was actually, well, quite humorous. I mean, still incest-y, but its a comedy short series, not some fanservice harem or something. The art style is quite unique, as well.

* [**Hoozuki no Reitetsu**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20431/Hoozuki_no_Reitetsu) - the first episode was alright - very funny at parts, but overall a bit slow. I still think the show has good potential, though. A lot of the jokes do require some background knowledge, though, of Japanese culture and mythology. Very nice art style and OP.


* [**Nisekoi**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18897/Nisekoi) - first episode hasn't aired yet, but like Inari Konkon, I've read a good bit of the manga. Also, the people involved in making this series are certainly qualified. Comedy is something Shaft can do very well, and I'd watch the series for Hanazawa Kana and Touyama Nao alone.

* [**Robot Girls Z**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19799/Robot_Girls_Z) - because every season needs a good absolutely crazy anime, and Robot Girls Z fits the bill perfectly. [My review of the first three episodes.](http://faultyreviews.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/robot-girls-z-01-03/)"

BonzoTheBoss,AdviceAnimals,1389347423.0,"You're right, and I apologise. It's just frustrating because I'm not sure if you appreciate the nature of addiction. People can be all too aware of how bad this burger is going to be for them, but a lot of fat people have self esteem issues or outright clinical depression who don't think they deserve to be content with their own bodies. The overweight often use eating as a stress coping mechanism, something established as children in their formative years. Eating healthy now means they need to find an alternative coping mechanism, and having people in their lives who they can trust not to make them feel worse and who can support them are a big help.

This is why the culture of fat shaming needs to change to one of education and support. No one is denying that individuals are ultimately responsible for their own health, but just telling them to ""man up and stop eating"" isn't going to help. Trust me, as someone struggling with their own weight, they're ashamed enough as it is."

If you liked Dragon Age and you can put up with older graphics you could try Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, supposedly there are mods for them that make the romances better/more in depth (for example, check [here](http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/adrian) under both expansion and npc mods). And some people think that there's a tragic romance quality to Planescape Torment as well. 

There are [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/1u6m3n/silicon_sisters_talk_about_making_everlove_a/) people who are taking a stab at creating romance games but so far nothing too successful yet.

Most seem to come in the form of /r/visualnovels with a Japanese style. I think the ones on PC should be better because at least they should have no microtransactions. Maybe just ask at /r/visualnovels , what you might be looking for is [otome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otome_game) (dating sims for female consumers). 

I know next to nothing about visualnovels sadly, I only know some female devs that make them (doesn't mean that they are any good, or maybe they are, point is, I have no idea :D): 

http://www.sakevisual.com/ (they have some that are free and playable in a browser)

http://www.hanakogames.com/ (they have demos for all their games I think)

I coursed through a bunch of hidden object puzzle games a while ago and some have a romance for your main character as part of the story (Nevertales, Flights of Fancy Two Doves, Queens Tales Beauty and The Beast) but none that personally struck me as too memorable (and often ruined by poor animation and terrible voice acting anyway). 

There has been some discussion before on games that have good romance elements:

Women's *wants* and **needs** are 2 completely different things. Thanks for proving my point, sweetcheeks.

Your entire post is just trying to validate Facebook as a solid dating tool in *certain situations* (that I guess i you're 15 would be the norm...). Situations in which grown, successful and attractive Men do not find themselves in period, therefore are irrelevant. A Man wants a date, he refers to his phone to call (or text) a prospect, prospects he has met by being a real Man, and then he sets one up through that. Or you know, he goes out and approaches hot women out in the real world and works his charm.

He doesn't get on facebook and updates his status, or ""Likes"" a girl's post (lol), nor comments on a girl's post to get her attention and force rapport in order to get a date.

A Man rarely ever dives in his social circle for dates. Women who are his friends, and nothing more, are in his friend zone for a reason. And if he does decide to date within whatever circle albeit social or workplace, he will decide to seduce (directly or indirectly) next time he sees them in person, which is presumably often because they're in his circles of interactions, and set a date face to face.

Unless you're injured and cant go out, and you have no phone, I guess Facebook is a the only tool left. Otherwise it's beyond silly and you should avoid the void that is social media.

BonzoTheBoss,AdviceAnimals,1389349410.0,"Stress is relative. Trying to ""one up"" someone by saying your life is harder than theirs is a cop out and you know it.

People obviously struggle with the issues I discussed because otherwise a growing number of the population wouldn't be obese. That isn't an exuse, that's a fact. Completely ignoring the psychological and neurochemical factors in obesity is just down right disingenuous. That's like telling the clinically depressed to ""stop making excuses, just be happy."" 

It ISN'T a black and white problem. People NEED to take responsibility. They have to want it. That's their choice. Societies job is to provide the encouragement and support to get people to where they need to be. That's what being a compassionate human being is all about, helping people to appreciate they have a problem and help them through it.

But society hates fat people. Ironically it's often people who used to be fat themselves that are the most hateful, because ""If I could do it, so can you."" Education, encouragement and support are the key."

xAFBx,AskMen,1389349422.0,"I'm two years older than my sister and when my sister and I were kids we fought pretty consistently and butted heads quite a bit - we're both pretty stubborn so arguments rarely ended quickly.

Now, though, we're more like friends. We talk semi-regularly about different things, mostly gym related since she's a gym rat and I'm trying to get into going to the gym.

We may disagree (fairly often) but at the end of the day she's still my sister and I care about her a lot. Over the holidays my sister went off the road in my mom's car on her way home (she had to work the next day and her car didn't have winter tires so my mom let her drive my mom's car the hour and a half drive home). When she called my mom's house I answered the phone because my mom was in the shower and my mom's boyfriend was in my mom's room watching a movie while I played around on my phone. I answered only to have someone scream crying into the phone - at first I thought my cousin's kids had managed to call my mom's home phone and were messing around until I finally managed to get the words out of her that she was in the ditch and she wanted my mom. I got up and yelled at my mom to get out of the shower we needed to go for a ride (I've never yelled at my mom like that before and I think I may have scared her a little). 

We ended up going to get my uncle to bring us in his truck since all we had was my sister's car which didn't have snow tires and the weather was pretty bad out. I sat in the front seat and was the first one out of the truck when we got to where my sister was - I raced over and made sure she was ok before getting her out of the car and handing her off to my mom.  I kind of took charge when I heard my sister crying through the phone and everyone just seemed to accept that I was taking care of things which was a weird feeling since I'm only 23. "

I think that telling an obese person to stop making excuses and just stop eating so much is like telling the clinically depressed to stop making excuses and just be happy. Do you think that's a bit disingenuous?

It *can* be cultural, in the context of individual families. If you're born and raised in a family where larger portion sizes and frequent snacking are the norm, you're not going to think there's anything wrong with that. Speaking anecdotally, I didn't realise until I started living with my SO that it isn't normal to consume a whole tub of ice cream in one sitting. Honest to god I'm not trying to sound condescending here but it genuinely didn't occur to me! Which is why encouraging healthy eating habits and education in proper nutrition at an early age is so important.

And yes, I think that depression CAN be a factor  and is linked to over eating. It's your choice, but if you're in the frame of mind where you've stopped caring about yourself then you need support to get back to the healthier frame of mind to make those positive choices."

skgoa,formula1,1389350982.0,"I'ld look at it from a different angle: would it even be worht it? Would they gather good enough data that they could use to develop the real car? 

Let's look at the different components of a car that they might want to test:

* Drivetrain: engines and gearboxes are tested on teststands already and engine manufacturers run their engines in test mules on tracks. (I.e. in part they already do what you propose.) There is not much to be learned from running the drivetrain in a ""95% real car"" that isn't covered already.

* Suspension: Motorsports teams have special rigs that simulate entire laps from recorded data. There is no need to run a car on a real track to do this and it's much cheaper and simpler to do this setup work in the factory.

* Aero: This would benefit from on-track testing but there is a problem, because the entire aerodynamic design of a car is more than the sum of its components. You can't just test parts outside of the environment they are meant to be in. Well, you could but then you have to spend a lot of time on calibrating you testing method and you have to make assumptions and aproximations, which makes the entire test not much better than CFD or windtunnel. It's the interaction between all the little bits and pieces that is so hard to model in a simulation.

* Tyres: As others have mentioned, the teams have no access to race tyres outside of sanctioned testing.

So, I'ld say that there isn't all that much benefit for what would cost quite a lot of money. It's also telling that Pirelli asked for a newer car to develop their tyres last year and has now switched to testing tyres with the current cars. The 5% difference that a ""95% car"" would have are enough to make it practically worthless."

No, sex is never owed. Sex is meant to be a mutually enjoyable activity, and it's quite important in so many cultures. But the caveat of that is if someone wants to have it, they need to find someone else interested.

But the way you've worded the question makes me think you're looking for something more subtle?  Which suggests to me your relationship might not be in the right place to be doing something like this.  Let me explain my relationship's history and maybe that will provide some context for what I think your relationship should be like in order to do something like this.





I'm a dude in my mid 20s.  Well, firstly, in my opinion, you have to have a certain frame of mind and personality which is compatible with playing with others.

Very early on in the relationship, I made it clear I wasn't a jealous guy.  Not, just with words, but with behaviour.  If you are the jealous type, this obviously won't work with you.  In my case, my partner was pretty skeptical and about a month into us being ""facebook official"" she tested my claim that I wouldn't really mind if she kissed another guy when on a night out, if I wasn't there to kiss.  She went out in a different town with only her best friend so there wasn't a big concern in terms of our friends finding out and being shocked.  When I was just as cool about it as I said I was going to be, she was a bit gobsmacked and said she didn't feel the same way about me doing similar.  But it didn't make us more distant or anything.

I've always been quite open with how deviant I am with my closest friends and so of course I was very open with my partner about my sexual habits and appetites from relatively early on.  I dropped bombs slowly over the first year, I watch loads of porn, I'm massively into bondage, etc. etc.  If any of these had been a deal breaker for her, at least I'd have found out in the first year and not 4 years down the line when I'm desperate for some action.  And I don't really want to have to hide shit from her.

She turned out to be pretty kinky as well, and me opening up to her helped her open up to me.  I found out that she was hugely into anal as well as me, she had rape fantasies, and so on.  Eventually with a dynamic like that conversation turned back to discussions on involving others.  This was at about a year into the relationship.  It actually didn't start out as a threesome thing, we just wanted to go to some local fetish events to meet other like minded people and maybe eventually get involved in some latex dressup.  The plan was to remain sexually exclusive, at least for the forseeable future.  Although to be fair, by this point, we'd already said things like how we totally wouldn't be surprised if we ended up being swingers later in life.

Anyway we ended up liking the community so much that we went to some events where we were aware that some people would be having sex in some of the back rooms.  We got propositioned by another couple that thought we were hot and were around our age. We said we'd think about it as we hadn't planned to do anything like that for now, but we discussed it during the event and eventually decided to go find them and experiment.

That day we ended up having our first experience playing with others, where both me and the other guy received double blowjobs.  Which as you can imagine was a lot of fun.

Anyway yeah I know this story isn't really helping you in terms of ""how do I ask for a threesome"".  I guess my point here is really that most couples probably aren't compatible with playing with others, and I definitely don't think an appropriate way to go about it is just saying ""I want to fuck other people"" or whatever.  I think you need to build up a communications line which isn't likely to be phased by such a discussion first.  If you're the type of person that hides the fact that you watch porn from your partner, then this isn't for you.  Also you need to not be jealous people.  Seriously, you really do.  Really, you want to be the type of person that is *turned on* by seeing your partner screwing someone else.

So ask yourself two questions:

Will seeing my partner having physical fun with another person be fun for me?

and

Do I feel that my partner and I are open enough about our sex lives for this?"

Caudheur,france,1389352921.0,"Salut à toi ami québécois !  
Comme tu ne précises pas où tu veux aller, je vais juste donner mon humble avis sur Paris :)  
  
On peut lire beaucoup de choses négatives sur la capitale. Gens antipathiques, prix élevés, transports pénibles, insalubrité etc...  
Et je dois dire que la plupart de ces avis sont bien fondés !  
  
Cependant, on peut aussi beaucoup se plaire à Paris. 
Une fois la froideur et le manque de politesse des gens
passés, on se rend compte qu'il y a plein de choses très sympas à Paris.  
Il faut juste savoir se blinder contre les petites impolitesses quotidiennes et ne pas s'offusquer.  
  
  
Il y a plein d'endroits très chouettes. Des restaurants copieux, des bars où on joue au billard en écoutant du vieux rock,
des jardins avec des petites allées fleuries, des ruelles médiévales désertes, des églises louches, des berges inondées, des arènes dansantes, des ponts cadenassés...  
De même avec les gens, on se rend très vite compte qu'il y a plein de provinciaux très gentils, et même (si si ça existe :) des parisiens pure souche qui sont modestes, ouverts d'esprits et pas snobs.  
  
Et puis Paris, c'est aussi de la culture pour tous les goûts. Un paquets d'énormes musées, la plupart gratuits pour les étudiants, plein de concerts, du classique à la pop, des lieux historiques à la pelle.   

  
Bref je voulais juste dire que Paris c'est certes spécial, mais ce n'est pas si horrible qu'on le dit parfois :)

skgoa,formula1,1389353218.0,"McLaren were the fastest because they had more downforce than anyone else, especially due to their hot-blown diffuser. (There were quickest in high-speed corners, where downforce plays the most part. They also suffered the most from the FIA's attempts to limit exhaust blown diffusers.) Having a few centimeters more empty space under the front of the monocoque didn't make enough difference to change that. McLaren valued the better roll center and center of gravity higher than the minimal amount of additional air they would get to the sidepods. It was a sensible decission, since their nose was designed as a ""snowplow"" and aimed to do something completely different from what the other teams were doing. (The ""snowplow"" nose had been invented at Williams at a time when the noses weren't as high.)

But over the course of the season they found that they weren't gaining in performance for a while, which deeply worried them. (Fun fact: that's why they decided to develop an entirely new car for last year. It didn't end well.) So they decided to try everything they could think of without compromising their entire design philosophy. They turned the front of the nosecone up and switched from ""snowplow"" to the common ""high nose"" philosophy. It was a rather minor switch that meant that more air was let through to the sidepods at the expense of the air being directed less precisely. We also saw changes to the bargeboards to cope with that. They wouldn't have done it if it didn't bring a performance benefit but you couldn't really tell form the overall on-track performance of the car."

That's not even what CS is about. CS is about programming and the theory behind it mostly. It's like you're asking a astronomer to fix your binoculars because he uses telescopes all day.

Apart from that, the astronomer (me) sometimes knows how to fix the ""binocs"", because you did some silly mistake like not removing the covers from the lenses. And sometimes I actually know stuff others don't about how to use ""binocs"". Stuff I learned when working with ""telescopes"". And of course, being an ""astronomer"", I acquired the skill of googling, so I can more often than not actually solve the problem at hand. Which only reinforces the damn myth that CS = IT.

I am not better at fixing your problem than any other computer user. All I do is google stuff and look for obvious mistakes. Sometimes I actually know stuff. Stop asking me, and figure out this google thing yourself. And if you happen to find acronyms you don't know -&gt; wikipedia.

Sadly, after 3-4 weeks, the urge comes back. But about a year ago, i used this time to switch to e-cigs, and my health has improved massively. I probably would have been able to switch to e-cigs without psychedelics, but i have no doubt that it would've taken me much longer.

addeman94,sweden,1389356247.0,"&gt; Behövde barn förr i tiden kortare tid för att lära sig saker?

Det tror jag inte. Jag vet inte hur länge sedan du menar med förr, men när jag tänker förr tänker jag på tiden när Sverige hade fler fabriker och det fanns fler vägar att komma in på arbetsmarknaden än högre studier. (Jag vet att det går att få jobb utan högre studier men andelen lågkvalificerade jobb har minskat avseevärt under de senaste generationerna.)

Visst, att lärarnas försämrade status, den ökade mängden pappersarbete och andra faktorer bidrar säkert till svenska elevers försämrade resultat. Jag tror dock att kraven på ungdomar har ökat mer än vad deras resultat har försämrats. 

Och även om det vore så att försämringen orsakades enbart av lärarnas försämrade status betyder det inte att det här är en dålig åtgärd.  
Lärarnas status kommer ta tid att höja, och även om läraryrket blir mer attraktivt kommer det ta tid innan vi ser resultaten av det, för du blir inte lärare över en natt. Att ge elever en chans att få extra hjälp om de har det svårt i skolan går snabbare och är lättare att åstadkomma.

Det här är ett problem med många orsaker och lösningar, och bara för att du tror att du känner till den ultimata och effektivaste lösningen betyder det inte att det finns annat som kan hjälpa."

EDIT 2: ARGHHH the Y axis goes up to 18! So there's actually 456 images...

techlos,schizophrenia,1389360803.0,"drugnerd and schizophrenia sufferer here. Here's a quick list of different classes of drugs, and the effects they've had on me

Amphetamines - massively increase paranoia and other symptoms. Not worth it.

MDMA - During the roll, paranoia disappears, as well as voices to an 
extent. They're stronger during the comedown, and long term has no real effect on my symptoms.

Cannabis - very mixed bag. Some strains send me paranoid, others decrease my symptoms. I'm considering growing a high-cbd strain to remove the variability of dealers, because not knowing how it'll effect you is a major turn-off for the drug.

Alchohol - not a big fan, so i can't say much on the subject. I just don't like drinking i guess.

Nicotine - Helps a lot with paranoia and to some extent with voices and hallucinations. On the other hand, it's highly addictive. Use at own risk,

Benzodiazepams - little to no effect on symptoms, but great for sleeping through an episode. Don't really enjoy them though, so my experience is limited.

Opiates - Little to no effect on symptoms, although the comedown combined with voices is rather shitty.

Psychedelics - easily the most surprising results for me. My first trip, i was easily more delusional at the peak... yet when i came down, my symptoms had more or less vanished. They gradually re-appeared over the course of a few weeks. The second trip, my symptoms didn't change too much during the peak. However, with some introspection, my paranoia went away, and never came back. Over the course of a few years, i took psychedelics once every 2 months. Since them, my symptoms have more or less vanished, and my psychiatrist has changed my diagnosis from paranoid type to residual type. I didn't tell him it was through using psychedelics, because i have no idea how he'd react... but the truth is they helped me.

Also, i'm no doctor, but anxiety over an anxiety disorder getting worse could be a symptom of having an anxiety disorder?

Hope this helps!"

I agree that it's well suited for Russian (don't speak Ukranian so can't comment there), but other Slavic languages use sounds that Russian doesn't have, so we'd have to make additions to Cyrillic as well.

The pronunciation rules that Russian follows would also make it impossible to transfer to a language like Czech (we don't soften our Ls and Rs before Es for example) so we'd have to change the way the script works pretty substantially.

And on a last note, I feel like you don't have much understanding for why we use so many ""accent marks"" (we refer to them as ""čárky""). They're used to denote the length of a vowel, something Russian could use as well if you ask me. It's the difference between the pronunciation of ""зáмок"" and ""замóк"".

&gt;Good evidence suggests that screen viewing before age 2 has lasting negative effects on children’s language development, reading skills, and shortterm memory. It also contributes to problems with sleep and attention.

To me, being a good parent means making an effort to avoid doing things that have lasting negative effects on my child's development.  Obviously I have to live in the real world and can't control every single thing in her environment to meet some standard of perfection. But I try to get the basics right as often as I can. This goes for food, TV, how we talk to her &amp; interact with her--the whole ball of wax. 

People are so touchy about this screen time issue. Lots of parents seem to feel that by trying to understand &amp; follow the AAP recommendation, a parent like OP (or myself) is implicitly criticizing/judging everyone who doesn't.  That's why in real life, I don't even mention to other people that we're doing this, other than to ask the grandparents to turn off the TV when they're babysitting our child.

I will give you a quite usual piece of advice there : find something new to do, a hobby, sport, music, reading, anything like this.

Since you masturbate less (and won't do it in a while, stay confident !) the time you used to waste masturbating is now free for more interresting things.

shortly said : If you want to go ahead, don't fight the past, but build the future.

Many people here will suggest working out, it's a good idea as it makes you produce endorphines and makes you tired (so you won't fap to fall asleep or correct a bad mood). Plus it's cool for self-esteem, and the higher testosterone rate in your blood can help musculation.

I find art is also good, I play trumpet since i'm a child, and I never chorused as good as since 32 days (wow ! I didn't realized it, time for a 1/3d repport !) I found out that ""sublimate one's libido"" aren't empty words.

Bugloaf,SiouxFalls,1389363677.0,"Here's a [crime map of the city](http://www.spotcrime.com/#sioux%20falls%2C%20sd). The overall rates are fairly low for a city its size.

I had my mail opened on a couple occasions, and people would just hang out in the parking area at all hours. 

If you needed to move into an apartment right away, I'd suggest the apartments on Carnegie Cir, north of 49th St. The apartments are a little old, but kept up and but relatively inexpensive (at least when I lived there). They're near the malls, but backed into a forest area that helps dampen the sound. Also, it's close to the bike trail and a library. 

Also, the apartments southeast of the intersection of Nevada Ave &amp; 57th St are fantastic.

They (especially C++) certainly have their warts, but I wouldn't say that something's a horrible mess because it gives you a lot of different tools to approach a job. As for being incredibly behind the curve, how so? C++11 gave the language some _massive_ improvements and syntactical sugar which makes C++ development much, much nicer than it was in the past.

&gt; And languages like python or c# are used widely, without causing this sort of frustration.

asianauthenticity,dating_advice,1389363851.0,"OP, judging by your replies, it sounds like you're exasperated - tired of trying, finding guys who seem to be into you, and who you are also interested in, only to find that they're in it for the pootytang. 

It's frustrating, it can feel demeaning, and at a certain point, it starts to bring down your self esteem. I've had experiences in the past where I was with someone casually - both of us were ok with this, and after some time, he ended up dating someone. They're still together - which is great, but not so great for your own self-esteem. You end up asking yourself questions wondering why you aren't good enough to be relationship material, why people see you as a piece of meat, and nothing more - it's not a fun state of mind to be in. 

Regardless of all of this however, you have to try as much as you can to not let it get to your mind. It's good that you have a strong grasp on what you want from a guy - at least one of the facets - which is commitment. Don't budge on that. 

Approaching a guy does not automatically make you someone who 'is going to put out', or that you 'want the d'. If you approach a guy and he automatically assumes you want on his cock? Move on, he's not worth your time. Assuming something like that gives you insight on what he's looking for, and clearly, it's not aligned with your terms.

That being said, you should still have somewhat of a romantic interest context when positing a 'hangout'. Although a lot of my friends have met their SO's at the bar/club/etc., I honestly think you might find more luck of not finding a 'hookup' guy if you maybe go through activities which are less geared for people going out (to essentially get a hookup). Arrange a game night - ask friends to bring friends. Have a dinner with friends, join a club, volunteer, talk to people in class - you have nothing to lose by expanding your social circles and opening your exposure to other guys. 

You see someone you find attractive? Cool - get to know him, hang out with mutual friends if possible, sneak some alone time if you can, and show signs of interest. This doesn't mean you need to get handsy, you don't have to go and blurt that you love him to pieces-- just make some small talk, keep lots of eye contact, see how he reacts. Does he keep eye contact? Is he smiling? When you move in closer (just a bit, this doesn't mean get up in his face), does he automatically back away/look uncomfortable or does he welcome it? If you get positive reactions, ask to hang out again (alone?) - maybe ask for a number. Hell, if you've hung out enough times, you could even ask to go to coffee or etc. Basically, set up a date, or give him the means to do it. If he's interested, he'll go for it. 

Playing coy doesn't get shit done. 

If you do get to hang out alone, don't get physical immediately - talk. Talking, taking interest in his life, his hobbies, etc. etc. will help show that you're interested in *him*, not just his dick. Communication is a two way street, and a lot of it is non-verbal. Set context of dates if you can. If not, get to know him and let him get to know you before you start macking. Maybe bring up that although lots of people are looking for hookups, you're just not into that. Hopefully, you get a similar reaction. 

Again, relationship guys exist - just like detached girls do. Pinning guys as only wanting to get it in is about as fair as saying all girls are obsessive serial monogamists. 

It's shitty how your experiences have gone - and I know it can really bring a girl down. I hate to go all Chicken Soup for the Soul on you, but REALLY. ATTRACTIVE BOYS WHO WANT RELATIONSHIPS EXIST. Attractive boys who DON'T want relationships ALSO exist. 

Giving up is not the solution. It'll make you bitter, it'll make you angry, it'll make you resentful, and that shit is NOT attractive in a potential significant other. You do you girl - you WILL find what you want - we don't just have THE ONE out there. There's plenty of guys, and if their interests in you don't align with your interests in them? Next, move along. 

I hope this ramble helped you a bit - if not, I'm sorry for making you read all of this. Whichever it is, I wish you best of luck in your endeavors.

I think I gave up once I started realizing that religion was always a way to get rich, teach others that a group of people were wrong/going to hell or take advantage of others who trust you (especially children &amp; parents).

Maybe she had an affair, maybe she spoke with an attorney or a friend who knows the financial impact a divorce would have. Maybe your changing back to the good guy you were when you first started dating has her changing her tune.

It's a question you are going to have to ask her yourself or get it out of her through counseling. I went to a variety of counselors, psychologist and even a psychiatrist with my Ex. I was married 16 years and have 3 beautiful children. I stayed in the marriage because of the kids at the later half of the 16 years and tried to stick it out but couldn't take it (Her and the IPV) anymore. I needed my sanity and life back again. 

The hurtful comments like your SO spouted were weekly occurrences with my Ex. They built up over time and just hurt more and more. I could go days with everything normal and then boom! She would throw a dagger at me out of left field. My Ex was a very jealous women. Many things that I did good like excelling at work, coaching my kids, having many friends both guys and gals, travelling for work to beautiful places, going above and beyond to see my mother and father and do nice things for them because they lived far away. I could go on and on and on. She also used sex as a weapon the latter half of the marriage as well. So yours is all over your like a female dog in heat is very interesting. 

You need to find out what's going on in her head, seriously and revisit your thoughts about the big D as well. I have never felt depression so bad until I had to move out of my house when my divorce was final. I had to be medicated, I couldn't sleep, I could barely go to work at times and get out of bed.

It took 2 years for me to eventually get back to some type of normal feeling and no depression. I am remarried to a wonderful woman now for more than 5 years. She has 3 older boys and is almost 10 years older than I am. A hell of a lot more mature than my Ex. who was a little younger than I am.

We have had our issues but we work on them together. Whether it be just plain and simple communication or even going to counseling.

Like /u/LaTuFu said ""Otherwise, if she divorces a perfectly good husband for no reason--she must be a bitch.

Life is to short to sweat the small stuff and her verbal blows (daggers) to you are not small.

I will be very curious to see which path you take. Fix it or break it.

So, her not feeling attracted to you turned into her not ever being attracted to you, and her feeling the marriage is not good any more turns into wanting to divorce when the time comes. She was probably projecting your current situation into the future, and seeing the same person and the same lack of attraction, and decided she doesn't want that marriage.

What you've done is show her that things don't need to be how she thought they would be.

When you say you agreed that you would divorce when the kids left, was that arrived at after discussing other options - discussing how you could work on things to repair the marriage? Maybe you skipped that out of shock, or out of a desire to compromise or appease. Maybe she wanted you to put up a fight, and win her over again. Perhaps by agreeing with her rather than fighting, and then making these changes to prepare for life without, you've shown her that she needs to fight as well.

You two need to get onside with each other and start fighting for your marriage together.

As for the disappointment that you're not going to get to sow some wild oats, do you think negotiated non-monogamy would be a possibility some time in the future? Worth thinking about, it's possible to sleep with other women and keep a healthy, working marriage going if you're the right kind of people and communicate well.

But the simpler option is to realise that you've got a good thing going on here, and to work for it together."

eatgeeksleeprepeat,AskReddit,1389366803.0,"I don't know if I actually technically met either of these people; one was unconscious and one I spoke to on the phone but it's definitely memorable.

I was at a store with my mom when this lady starts yelling for help. Another woman around the corner from us started falling and the one yelling for help was helping to move her to the ground. I noticed that woman falling was unaware of what was going on and her face was contorting (I assume sort sort of heart attack or stroke). As my mom called 911, I sprinted to the store's front desk to tell them to also call 911 and that a customer needed some sort of medical help.

When I got back to my mom, the lady was on the ground, unconscious and bleeding from the mouth. We went through her purse looking for medication, an ID or a phone. Something to give us more info about the woman to relay to the 911 person.

I found the woman's phone and luckily, it was on and not locked. I found a contact labeled ""Home"" and called. A man picked up and I asked if he was (lady's name)'s husband. He was. I let him know what was going on and kept talking to him until the paramedics arrived. The paramedics even handed me the phone back to keep him calm while they worked. When they took her to the hospital, she was still breathing and seemed OK.

I'll remember it because while I was scared, I found I could still think and act in an emergency situation. I'll never know what happened to her or if she's okay, but I remember how thankful her husband was that we contacted him and told him what was going on. When I think of the group of people that stood by to help, it makes me worry less when my own mom goes out by herself. Some strangers are willing to help and not just stand by."

The more people there are, the more that multi-million-dollar cost is distributed. If the game is $10m and sells a million copies, the costs work out to $10 per copy for development and $5 per copy for the disk, so each copy costs the developer $15. If it sells two million, the cost per game is just $10. Five million makes it $7."

Volunteers flake out, at times she did everything on her own, then she got some health troubles.  

My wife actually got a full time job at the SPCA where we live now, and she hated it, it was run so much like business it made her miserable.  They priced their adoption fees based on how cute the animals were and how much they thought they could get.  They practically ran a credit check and background check on you just to adopt a dog.  She ended up leaving after only a couple months, when we adopted another dog we went to an all volunteer organization.  

Support your all volunteer/small organizations as much as you can!  If they have a full time staff and board of directors, its really much more about the money than the animals.

The current mantra from the left is that minority students are being disciplined too often, so they want policies in place where there are no more minority students punished than whites - no matter what the racial mix of the school is or what the infractions are.

In the case of the school where Martin had been a student, there had been a lot of arrests of minority students, which was making the school and police look bad - so they worked out a deal where the schools would handle things internally and it would never be reported as a crime.

That's why when Trayvon Martin was caught vandalizing school property, and when he was caught with stolen property taken in a burglary (and with burglary tools), it never became a police matter."

The two examples you said are very good ones for this argument.

Put simply you know very little about autism and most of it seems to be misinformation, which you can't be faulted for as most of the information out there for the public is misinformation (imagine that the KKK were the most trusted source for information on black people, that's kind of what's going on with autism) but proper education on the subject would make you understand how absurd the idea is.  The only options with autism are to either attempt to eradicate the genotype (which would be bad beyond the artistic and scientific ramifications as we're finding a larger percentage of the population is autistic, 1 in 50 and as we get better at diagnosing it that rate is only rising), round up everyone showing the phenotype (killing those deemed useless and essentially enslaving the rest), or to try to improve public perception and further reduce the number of low functioning individuals (not by killing them)."

Not that Butler's turgid prose counts as lit, but it can still cause us to question our assumptions.

There will always be room for disagreement about where one should begin coming to grips with great literature, and at what point in that journey should the reader be exposed to less significant works (or purely academic works like Butler's) in order to better inform their reading of these cultural touchstones.

If you're unhappy with the way your government directs your military, talk to your local represenatives. Only you can change that. Screaming at the rest of the world to beef up their military is probably counter-productive to world peace. De-militarisation is a good thing!

Professionals often play 301, where the point of the game is to get to 0 first.  But you must double out.  Basically hitting a double point square to end the game.  This usually consists of 3 rounds of throwing three darts.  Scoring over 100 each round is impossible if you want to win.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,feminisms,1389369282.0,"&gt;When it comes to questions of morality, I'm a consequentialist. Things are wrong proportionate only to the harm they cause. Something that causes more harm is worse than something that causes less harm.

I understand that. There are some things I look at in that way too.

&gt;You appear to be applying a strict (simplistic) rule to all behavior, arguing that it's the behavior itself--rather than its consequences--that deserves the focus. I do not find this defensible. The world is not so black and white.

Not to all behaviour, no. Believe me when I say that I've had it drummed into me over the last few years that not many things in life are black and white. But prejudice? Yes, I do think that it is the prejudice itself that deserves the focus (as much focus as the consequences of that prejudice), because that prejudice is what drives people to implement systemic oppression. I do not find a particular prejudice to be defensible or less bad in one scenario, but horrible and worthy of eradication in another, simply because of who holds the prejudice. If it's bad for one group to hold that prejudice, it's bad for another group to hold it too. The prejudice is the root cause of the consequences.

It's like saying that we should focus on the consequences of drunk driving but that the underlying cause isn't as important (namely, people driving drunk). I don't think that's a workable plan - until you address the root cause of drunk driving accidents/deaths, it won't get better. Racism is the same. Unless you address the root cause - which is the prejudice that people feel for those who differ from them - the institutional oppression will not go away. And if you justify or defend prejudice in minorities while condemning it in the majority, that will only serve to foster *more* ill feelings between the groups. 

&gt;If a twelve-year-old punches me in the face, I've got less cause to be upset than if an adult black belt does, yet it's the same behavior in either case. Should we seek incarceration for both offenders with equal fervor?

Prejudice is an attitude, not an action. Actions and attitudes aren't the same thing. Actions can differ in severity; but a racial prejudice is just as ugly from one person as it is from another.

&gt;Systemic racism doesn't exist because individuals are prejudiced; it exists because individuals with disproportionate social capital are prejudiced.

Systemic racism exists because enough people within the majority share the same prejudice. It is *prejudice* that first drives social oppression - that oppression would not exist without the power of the majority behind it, of course, but it also wouldn't exist if that prejudice didn't exist either. It is the prejudice first and foremost that leads them to use their power to oppress others. The prejudice, not the power, is the heart of the problem."

I think what's difficult for foreigners to comprehend is just the sheer size of some of our alumni bases, and how much sports factor into that identity. College football teams are often community institutions as well as campus institutions. You have a lot of people who want to tune into what a particular team is doing, so there's lots of money to be made, and that money goes into the program (as most athletic programs are nonprofits), which explains why some teams are practically pro teams"

no. 

&gt; sex is rape IF the woman is passive and doesnt know how to say no

If the victim doesn't want it to happen, and doesn't say yes or give some other CLEAR indication of consent, it's rape. 

&gt; sex is rape IF the woman is threatened and doesnt want to say no out of fear of physical pain

Yes, that's rape. 

&gt; sex is rape IF the woman  doesnt say no because she is tricked into sex by some very clever male who convinces her that he doesnt want to have sex with her while he is actually trying to have sex with her

Uh... what? Pretty sure that at whatever point sex is about to happen, she would notice and have the opportunity to say no. If she says no and sex happens anyway, it's rape. If she's threatened into agreeing to sex, it's rape. If she wasn't expecting to have sex with him but decides she wants to in the heat of the moment, that is not rape. 

&gt;  This is confusing 

Sex without consent is rape. No matter the gender of the people involved, no matter whether there's violence or not. Consent can be verbal or nonverbal, but ""just lying there and not doing anything"" is not consent. "

As far as the lies...

1) If you have impure thoughts you WILL BURN IN HELL FOREVER AND EVER.

2) Woman do not enjoy sex and have no sexual needs other than to please their men.  In fact, women only experience pain during sex.

3) If you masturbate, you'll go blind, grow hair on your palms, and you'll wear out your dick so that it won't work anymore.

Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever.

By that logic, the homeless people of North America should just shut up and be thankful for the existence of shelters and soup kitchens because the people of the second and third world don't have that.

But we don't do that because that's not fair. We'd never reasonably tell the homeless to stop complaining because they have it better than they would if they were elsewhere in the world. They live HERE. And they're important, their opinions and concerns are important. In the same way, if a woman or person of colour (which is a term used when describing .....well....non-whites as far as I know, much less a term used specifically to rob heritage) feels that they are being oppressed or that there is inequality, well the fact that elsewhere in the world others are worse off does not invalidate that thought.

As far as your looks in the real world go, obviously some dudes aren't into muscular chicks, but those dudes tend not to realize that a body after working out is swole and cut, but most of the time they look pretty normal. Even ""buff"" chicks look pretty damn feminine most of the time. Dudes who sit in front of a computer all day tend not to realize this. The point is, you have an athletic body and lots of guys are into that. You're not very curvy though, which can be a real deal-breaker. It's in our DNA to want curves so you can't blame us.

As far as your face goes, its below average IMO. Makeup and hair can be your friend or your worst enemy. For example, pic 4 is cute and feminine while pic 1 is pretty much just scary. If I was you id try to lean toward a natural look and experiment. Bottom line, don't expect to be prettiest girl in the room, but do expect to get attention based on your interests and possibly your body. Probably tough to hear but it's the truth.

How is she doing developmentally? Is she meeting all of her milestones relatively on time? I say ""relatively"" because every child is different. Is she eating and drinking well?

If the answers to these questions are 'yes' then it is probably just how she's going to be. If they are 'no,' have there been any sudden decline in her motor skills? You didn't say how old she is, so when I say 'decline' its all relative to her age. If she is at the age where she should be walking and running well, a decline would be if she is suddenly stumbling a lot more, or falling down a lot more all together, unable to get up and go like she used to.

Your doctor will probably ask you all of these things, so really start paying attention, but try not to over analyze. Make sure to give honest answers. No one wants there to be something possibly wrong, but its important to recognize it as soon as possible if there is."

No, you don't *have* to. But if you have the opportunity to go somewhere and try something new and learn something, why wouldn't you? You will certainly have a lot of different experiences within your own country, or state, or even city. As long as you're open to them. And if you're open to them, why not to new experiences in other places too?

Lots of people who have travelled are pretentious about it. ""We did a cruise around the Pacific Islands and there was a pool and a disco on board and we had our own butler and we saw the natives of New Caledonia do a dance! Oh I love travelling!"" And if you asked them what they learned, ""I bought the cruise cookbook!"" These people travel because they are told they should, but they never step away from their comfort zone. Sounds like they are the people you've had most contact with. That sucks for you, those people are annoying as hell.

But you don't have to be pretentious to travel. You just have to be open-minded. From your second paragraph, it sounds like you are. If you do get a desire to go somewhere, take the chance.

What do you feel? Probably sad, but happy for them. Now consider the following: during liftoff, the rocket has an engine malfunction. It self destructs in Lower Earth Orbit killing your beloved compadre. 

Now you feel something a little different--grief. But nothing has changed *from your vantage point*. The only difference is the person is dead, no longer living their dream job. Either way, you would have never seen or talked to them again.

Thus, it seems when something *good* happens to our loved ones, we're happy for them, even if we can never talk to them again. True, we may be sad--but it is a decidedly different emotion from grief, which we feel when they die. 

What do Christians feel when their loved ones die? Happy, or filled with grief? Your emotions betray your arguments. It's as if you *know* deep down, hey, this is a crock of shit. But **I have to believe it's true. I have to.** You're so close to asking ""why do I have to?"" but then you kinda logically faceplant."

The 3G iPhone I had replaced 5 times because it was probably the worst made phone they made, each one had different issues. From screen dust, to broken jacks, I hated that iPhone. 6 total.
Skipped 3GS.

Skipped the 4S.
iPhone 5, the first one I got had a faulty screen, then the second replacement was a speaker, and the third was the camera fell into the phone. 4 total.

So that puts me at 17 iPhones. Here's the deal though, every time they were very quick and friendly, transferring all my content was always very easy and I never lost any information in a transfer.

As I grew older and was exposed to more religions and more information as a teenager I moved away from Religion. I saw to many hypocrisies and groups trying to manipulate what was intended to provide people with purpose, hope, an explanation to life to manifest their own ideas and desires. Groups like the Westboro Baptist Church and famous Religious cults where people claim to be the second coming of Christ and such, or Religious groups in the Middle East going to war and resorting to terror and violence over different interpretations of their Religion. I think Religion began to feel like too much of negative thing than a positive thing due to all of the information I was exposed to. It just seemed like people lost sight of what their Religion truly stood for and I wanted no part in that. Personally I do not hold true to any specific God or God's, however I do believe in a higher power.

travelingmama,AskReddit,1389372316.0,"Was raised very very religious. It was such a part of my life I never even thought twice. I thought I was lucky to have it. My husband and his mom had joined the same church as mine when he was a teenager, still super believer when I met him, we got married in our church etc. Less than a year after we were married his mom started to pull away from it and ended up leaving altogether. Around the same time we moved in with my parents who were dismissive of the things my husband loved the most about the church (it's really hard to explain) and then they got all weird when we decided to be vegetarian like we were going against the church when they actually recommend it (again, hard to explain unless you're well versed in our church). It was a combination of these things that led my husband to lose faith completely. I began to question for the first time in my life and began to see the vast amount of inconsistencies and hypocrisies. At this point I still have a hope that there is a life after this and that God exists, but I don't know for sure so I don't let it dictate my life. 

My biggest criticism is the way it claims to be for families, but it rips them apart. If my mom knew that I lost faith, our relationship would change. And will change when she finds out. I will raise my kids to let them know that I will love them no matter what they choose. I didn't have that kind of security and it pisses me off."

laefil,MensRights,1389372778.0,"&gt; Is it though? Women control much more money than men do. Women vote more, and if you have any faith in the validity of our political systems, means they have more political power. I could go on and on, but women in the west are far from disadvantaged. You women now both earn more, and do far better in education.

women make up 51% of america's population, and they do vote more--more women go to school, even, than men--but that does not change society's perception of them, nor does it change pressure on what it ""means"" to be a man. 

many women might tell you that they feel they are underrepresented. how many congresswomen have we had in office vs. congressmen? how often do we focus on women of power in media, without judging their character or capacity by appearance? how many female writers, artists, inventors, scientists, etc, have been promoted? sure, it's much more now than it used to be, but we see that women are still sexualised, their voices demeaned, their efforts held to double standards, etc. all of these things are much worse, by the way, for women of colour, who are exoticised and fetishised. men of colour have a much harder time, too, in being taken seriously and being promoted as intellectuals (unless it fits in with a certain ""stereotype"").

a good documentary (although i wish they had talked more about these problems as human problems) to watch would be ""Miss Representation"". they highlight the struggle for power. the group that did that documentary are also now working on one about men and their struggles growing up.

&gt;Is it though? Isn't there maybe just a bit more theory and what essentially boil down to tenets from an ideological standpoint, which feminism certainly has become? Isn't feminism also about the theories that created the duluth model, the tender year doctrine etc.?

i'm not entirely sure what you mean. initially the 'tender year doctrine' said that any children would belong to the father after a divorce, owing to the idea that any children conceived were a property of the father's. this changed in 1839 after a feminist had lost her children to a divorce. i would say this is important considering that children were historically considered ""father's property""--what about mom? what if the dad's a bad guy? can't a mother have her children?

the duluth model is important. i am not sure of what you're getting at. i think that if someone said ""OK, that's great, give women some power over their own lives and children, but what about the stereotypes about women being powerless, needing special protection, etc? surely this would mean women would receive the most sympathy, which perpetuates sexism and stereotypes,"" we could do away with a lot of flaws. it seriously all goes down to how women and men are perceived.

&gt;What? It goes beyond reality? Theory is really important, but the actual effects of that theory does trump theory every time. Yes, being a human is complicated. Feminism isn't going to fix that. It does the opposite. To be a feminist you have to look at the world a different way, through a pair of ideological glasses.

ideology is better than scepticism. i feel that without ideology, we would not have the civil rights movement, we would not know many of the things we know or have today, we would not have such great works of art or human feat. to believe in something better is always a good thing. hope is always a good thing.

feminism may not ""fix it"", but it provides a bridge and a broader perspective. theory is important because it provides an answer to questions. if the theory doesn't work out--oh well, there's probably another way to work it out. isn't that the way it works anyway? you try, and if you fail, you try again from a different angle.

&gt;Also, if you actually look into history, you'll quickly discover that class had much more to do with oppression than sex ever did. To put it another way: I doubt the Queen of England ever felt opressed.

of course not! she's rich! and yeah, i do agree: corporations get a lot of money by making people feel shitty and objectified.

well it's all right. i don't have any hard feelings. i just hope that men and women can stop blaming each other. it would be so much better to communicate about these problems without going ""well i go through this"" or ""but you're privileged like that"". it's unproductive and harmful."

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389373062.0,"I've had quite a few ""Oh, you should just give him a chance! He's such a nice guy!"" type conversations. Many of them come from my mother. She's convinced that I'm mean to boys. She has campaigned quite hard for a few of them over the years. I just agree with her when she lists their positive traits, and then I tell her that I understand he's a great guy but I'm just not into him. If she really pushes it, I say I'm not attracted to him, which she doesn't often have a good argument for.

My mother is normally a bit critical of guys her daughters date, except in my case. In my case, she always defends them no matter what because, again, she thinks I'm not very nice to them in general. I think it's because when I was in high school/college I got asked out a fair amount, which meant I was turning guys down a fair amount. I swear I'm nice other than that! But such is life.

I did have the ""everyone deserves a chance"" mentality drilled into me from a very young age. When I headed into my teenage years, I was told by basically everyone older than me that I *must* agree to a first date unless I felt like my personal safety was at stake. And if a boy asked me to dance at a dance, I must agree to dance with him unless I was there with another date, because it's impolite not to. On a basic level I agree that it's best to give people a chance unless you know for certain nothing will come of it - but people can definitely take that idea too far."

I always tried to give my kids *consequences* instead of punishments.  If you can figure out something that is directly related to the incident, that is distasteful (but not shaming) to the child, I think that is best.  It teaches them that their actions have consequences, not to just avoid punishments.

Kid throws rocks?  Apology to the victim, written if s/he's old enough.  Then maybe some missed recess times so that he can help the teacher clean the classroom or something.  

I used to make my son write me paragraphs (grammatically perfect) on ""Why [insert infraction here] was a Bad Idea.""  That wouldn't have worked with his little sisters.  They would have loved creative writing assignments.  They would sometimes get extra chores, or less TV/computer time, or have to miss an event that they wanted to attend.  

Not listening?  Start removing things/privileges that come back when the listening improves.  Always give a warning, and then follow through swiftly so they know you mean business.

With little guys (toddlers), sometimes time outs are necessary.  For both of you.  :)  It gives everyone a chance to cool off.

EByrne,AskReddit,1389373286.0,"My parents were extremely Catholic, but to their credit they never really pushed it on me. My best friend was devoutly Lutheran, and whenever I spent the night at his house on Saturday I would go to church with them on Sunday. And... I dunno. Even at a young age, it just sounded to me like they were preaching fear. They can say that it's about love all they want, but that doesn't stack up when out of the other side of their mouth they're saying that everyone but them is bound for eternal damnation and they're okay with that. Also, the local pastor had a son who came out of the closet, and as a result the pastor started a support group for Christian families who were dealing with having gay children. And to see how thoroughly that divided the community, and the vitriol that came from the other side from otherwise-decent people, was really eye-opening. It made me recognize that, to whatever extent the Bible does preach love, it's the parts that preach hate and intolerance (and there are many) that most people primarily take away from it. And that was never something that I was interested in being a part of. 

It really struck me the wrong way that my best friend's family, all of whom had basically adopted me as their own at that point, each and every one of them sincerely believed that I would burn in hell no matter how good of a person I was. And if, god forbid, I had been gay, they would have essentially hated me without a second thought. If that's their idea of a just and loving god, then I have no desire to worship him even if you could convince me that he was real. 

Even more than all of that, though, I'd cynically say that I just wasn't indoctrinated enough for it to take. How many people do you know that become Christians later in life without being thoroughly indoctrinated as children? There's a reason why they go after you when you're young. Because if your capacity for reason is even marginally formed, then it doesn't make sense, and the god that the Bible describes is a spiteful dick who's unworthy of worship anyway. "

travelingmama,changemyview,1389373615.0,"Babies change really fast. There's about a month of them looking like a newborn until they start to develop their more distinct features. This will decrease your exposure of newborns by a significant amount. When you don't have a lot of exposure to a certain type of person, it's hard to see the differences between them. There are some ethnic groups that I do not have a lot of exposure to and have such a difficult time telling the difference between them. Does that mean that they literally all look the same? No. It just means that I personally have not spent enough time looking at them so my ability to see their distinct features and associate them. For example, I live in Utah, there are three different ethnic groups I am exposed to regularly. If you showed me a picture of an eastern Asian person I would not be able to tell you if they were Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Laotian, Korean, etc. People from these countries are very different, but I don't know what their differences are. 

So it makes sense why you would think newborns look the same. I worked in Maternity for 4 years and saw so many newborns that I could actually tell which parent they looked more like a lot of the time. Newborns do have their own distinct features, but at that age, their characteristics and movements are so similar (like how they move their arms and legs, their facial expressions, and the fact that they're almost always sleeping) that it's difficult to tell them apart.

If I don't know, it feels like all my efforts are fruitless, even though I know they're not.

biffysmalls,SquaredCircle,1389373833.0,"You are mistakenly assuming that The Network will be the driver that PPVs once were, which will result in longer term creative storytelling. The Network may be assuming the distribution and broadcasting of PPV shows, but no longer will TV be written to get more buys, nor will it be written to necessarily get more subscribers because the success and failure of The Network will have nothing to do with its digitized vaulted content, and everything to do with new content. It will be the Network shows that drive subscriptions after the honeymoon period and maintain its profitability because they are what represent the value add in the business plan.

If anything, storylines are likely to become even more narrow and short-term focused. While they can measure things like the number of times a video is viewed (and who is featured in it) on The Network, length of user viewing, ""likes"", tweets, even where individual users fast forward through some part of the video over others, when the overnight ratings come in on Tuesday morning for Raw, they can be broken down TO THE MINUTE. They know precisely who's drawing (and in what demos) and who's not instantly. With steadied revenue replacing the spikes of PPV buys, the best metric they'll have to assess a worker's drawing ability will be those per-minute TV ratings.

Hence, those ratings are what creative will write television in response to, and as a result, angles will probably feel more compressed, not lengthened. With that in mind, that's why NXT and the Development Centre in Florida is so vital. Incoming talent to the main roster will have ZERO room for error, so when they get called up, they have to be ready for that kind of spotlight and to deliver the goods immediately in their assigned role, to an even greater extent than they ever have had to be ready before.

This is an evolutionary step not just for the company but for the industry. My only worry is that if or when, a wrestling company comes along and tries to promote pro wrestling in the United States, that the product will no longer look or feel like the apparent industry standard. Professional Wrestling, as it has been known is gone on a mass scale in North America, and it probably won't ever come back, though I hope I'm wrong. No more kayfabe, no more long term angles, no rough edges. Sports Entertainment will completely eclipse it on February 24, 2014."

I want to live my life as I wish (obviously I have to do some necessary things to survive, like get a place to stay). Also, none of the beliefs of most religions appeal to me. 

Christianity's beliefs seem like nonsense. We have evidence that the Earth was not created in 6 days. We have evidence that animals evolved and weren't all created at the same time. 

I don't know much about other religions, but I think Judaism is practically the same as Christianity, but with different practices and one different belief (about Jesus being the Messiah). 

All I know about Buddhism is that it is hardly a religion at all, but more a set of customs and beliefs that involve unbiasedly loving everyone and passiveness, which I don't think I am capable of. 

Atheism believes there is are/is no god(s), but until there is proof of the existence or nonexistence of god(s), I am going to stay away from Atheism. 

I personally doubt there is a god, but I can't say for sure, so I remain non-religious. "

Then you need 2 or 3 batteries for about $18 to $30 for them. Then you need to spend anywhere from $20 - $50 for a charger. You may also want a new clearo to go with your new device as well. That will tack on another $4 to $20 for each device. So if you go with the MVP you save about $50 if you go that way.

duckduck_goose,OkCupid,1389374782.0,"What has become needed in the online dating world, the exclusivity talk, was never needed before the rise of online dating among young people. I hate to be all *in my day* here but really one of my longest relationships started out without any sort of talk. We just fell into the position of LTR material organically. I'm not one to say *my boyfriend* like the lady at that party Elaine is attending who keeps asking if anyone has seen her fiance and I don't dish out the I LOVE YOU BOO verbage even in private. I just feel if a good portion of your time is spent seeing one person or talking to one person you're clearly in a relationship with that one person. I think some people don't want to have that talk even when all signs already point to it being a done deal because it's better to think ""well s/he's left me for another person"" than just ""s/he left me because of me"". Hence there's a lot of threads here where people are basically exclusive but they don't want to talk about it. If you're the guy who rushes to disable your profile because the other party disabled theirs you're the guy who wants an exclusive relationship with that girl. It's not fucking manipulation.

I told the guy I began seeing way early on: ""I don't like to date more than 1 person at a time so as long as this is happening I'm just seeing you"" and he said basically likewise. Then there were more words on both ends over the course of time. ""I'm totally falling for you"", ""I would feel hurt if you were on a date with someone else and I had that in my head when sending you a text"", ""I'm already thinking of you like you are my girlfriend.""

Maybe that's OAB/OAG stuff but fuck it. I've spent a lot of time hedging my bets. If he dumps me I'm not in a better place because I had other options. I'll still feel hurt. I don't understand why people are so afraid to commit to someone."

I'm currently looking to make the jump from film to digital and have been saving money for a DSLR. 

I've decided on a Nikon system as I have Nikon film cameras and older AI and AI-S Nikkor glass - and have narrowed it down to two cameras: The D300/300S or the D7000.

Reviews have pointed me towards the D7000, but a lot of the people on the DPReview forums are saying the D300 is closer to a pro-body than the D7000. 

I will be eventually moving into the FX Or professional bodies once I get the hang of a DSLR, and the lenses I buy will be older Nikkor or newer full frame.

I have no current intentions to do action shots (sports) and would like to focus on wildlife and landscapes (and particularly star trails). I don't have a single desire for video.

My camera will eventually become my backup body when in move to a D800 or something similar. 

Out of the D300 and the D7000, which is the better camera for someone who will be holding on to it for a long, long time?"

davinox,Poetry,1389375213.0,"I wanted to share with you, /r/poetry, my favorite poem. 

There are so many wonderful things about this poem, but to me the chief quality is how careful and varied it is in its tone. Truly a virtuosic work.

It starts with an abstract, philosophical tone:

    All the new thinking is about loss.
    In this it resembles all the old thinking.
    The idea, for example, that each particular erases
    the luminous clarity of a general idea.

which could have continued to be a very different (and much much weaker) poem:

    All the new thinking is about loss.
    In this it resembles all the old thinking.
    The idea, for example, that each particular erases
    the luminous clarity of a general idea.
    Similarly, all the new trends are about irony,
    which was once a way of understanding the Gods,
    how omnipotent beings could leave no trace of their power.

...You get the idea. 

But Hass immediately switches to another register, that of the naturalist, the romanticist, the sensualist! Beautiful imagery of a bird arrives, to ""back up"" the philosophy.

    That the clown-
    faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk
    of that black birch is, by his presence,

and then he returns to abstraction. Notice the control, how effortlessly he changes tone...

    some tragic falling off from a first world
    of undivided light. Or the other notion that,
    because there is in this world no one thing
    to which the bramble of blackberry corresponds,
    a word is elegy to what it signifies.

OK. He has shown himself to be a worthy poet. He can mix philosophy and imagery coherently. It flows. It works. 

Now he takes you into an entirely different register - the confessional, the poet speaking to you about his life. And woven into this is absolutely gorgeous imagery. And it all has to do with the philosophy stated at the very beginning! Just look:

    We talked about it late last night and in the voice
    of my friend, there was a thin wire of grief, a tone
    almost querulous. After a while I understood that,
    talking this way, everything dissolves: justice,
    pine, hair, woman, you and I. There was a woman
    I made love to and I remembered how, holding
    her small shoulders in my hands sometimes,
    I felt a violent wonder at her presence
    like a thirst for salt, for my childhood river
    with its island willows, silly music from the pleasure boat,
    muddy places where we caught the little orange-silver fish
    called pumpkinseed. It hardly had to do with her.
    Longing, we say, because desire is full
    of endless distances. I must have been the same to her.
    But I remember so much, the way her hands dismantled bread,
    the thing her father said that hurt her, what
    she dreamed.

Now to bring it all together, he makes a grand, general, almost mysterious statement. And ends it with chant, with song. And it all has philosophical AND personal weight at this point.

    There are moments when the body is as numinous
    as words, days that are the good flesh continuing.
    Such tenderness, those afternoons and evenings,
    saying blackberry, blackberry, blackberry.

Such a beautiful and powerful poem! 

Masterful, controlled, elegant, lyrical, thoughtful, and yes, deep! It is song-like while at the same time modern. Free verse, but far from sloppy. It is intellectual without being pretentious. It is confessional without being juvenile or gross or sad. It is sad without being sentimental. It is happy without being sentimental. It is mature. It is humane. It is a joy to read."

I haven't used Android for a good while now, but my first Android device had an 800MHz CPU and 256MB of RAM and it was dragging it's feet by middle-point 2 releases and into 3 before it simply lost all support to run new software. Microsoft has done a commendable job keeping things tight with spec control, but this issue isn't related to software adaptability, it is essentially an issue of hardware. It isn't visible to the consumer because of the restriction on devices (imagine if 8.1 was adapted to try to run on a weak WP7 device). I can't get too angry at Apple for favoring new devices and feature sets over 3-4 year old devices. If Microsoft were to rebuild new code for old devices, the outcome would be similar. It's simply a scientific issue, not a marketing one.I can't be brought down to much to argue for or against any company's upgrade paths. Apple's updates have T concerned me much. They seemed to be driven at getting one to purchase more from their variety of stores. I think Microsoft has been giving the best bang for the buck with upgrades in WP8. In WP7, I didn't feel like the updates were very worthwhile. Since then, however, each GDR has added a few significant features.

duckduck_goose,OkCupid,1389375470.0,"Let me explain:

In a date it doesn't happen organically. One person (usually the guy) forces intimacy to test the waters. A knee bump, a hand touch, a poke in her side, a high five. I really don't like having men force intimacy on me during dates. However this is common and many women wait for it. What's the difference between the PUA guy forcing intimacy on her and you? Nothing. The fact that the knee bump at the bar also leads to this expectations she's going to want you inside of her at the end of the date is another thing I particularly don't like but it's part of the ritual.

What I'm saying is this: escalating kino and bumping knees are the same damn thing. What makes you different on the outside view from a PUA?"

Fluttershyhoof,TwoXChromosomes,1389375537.0,"I absolutely take questions. :) 

Being a woman vs a man is interesting. As a male there is a general assumption of competence on my part. However, people in passing or at shops or w/e are put off when I'm nice. This is because, as far as I figure, when a guy is nice it must mean he wants something or is hitting on you. I was stronger, my emotions were kept at arm's length, except for anger, and people seemed to be less compassionate/open to and around me. 

As a woman, when I'm nice, people are nice back, or assume I'm flirting... because obviously women can't just be nice without it being sexual. *sarcasm*. Anyways, I'm weaker, my emotions are stronger, both my good and bad ones. People are more open and compassionate with me, and being open and mushy is a good thing. 

Taking hormones at first gave me morning sickness, messed with my vision, and made me go all over the place emotionally. After about a month though everything settled in and it felt like coming home. It was as though my body was designed for gasoline, but my whole life I'd been running on diesel. Taking estrogen was like putting gas into the system for the first time. Everything ran smooth and finally felt right. "

The world has some pretty twisted shit, and has always had it.  Religion was a crutch for those who are afraid to be on their own in this world.  Fear of what comes, and the chance of a clean slate are what made them believe.  I just wanted to live for myself, and didn't care about what-ifs.

So I told my mom I didn't believe when I was 13.  She didn't believe me then, and she still dragged me to church sometimes, but she let me live my way.  "

octopushug,relationships,1389375956.0,"Your boyfriend doesn't really sound financially responsible or considerate toward you. The red flag for me is him encouraging you to incur further debt for a luxury (vacation) when it is clearly already difficult for you to make ends meet. It's astounding to me that you've maxed out your credit cards--and he doesn't seem to give a shit and even gets angry over how stressed you are? How much debt has *he* incurred? Does he have financial support from family, if he's only making 12k more than you? How supportive is he of your other problems and passions in life if he's so dismissive about this glaring issue?

Get a handle on your debt and do not dig yourself into a deeper hole. Check out /r/personalfinance and/or /r/frugal for tips. Cut what expenses you can to pay down your debt as soon as possible. Credit card debt in particular can chase you for years due to high interest rates and finance charges.

Personally, I would consider a difference in financial responsibility to be a dealbreaker, and marriage would never even come close to being on the table. Obviously, we're only hearing one snippet about the relationship so I can't exactly jump into DTMFA mode, but seriously consider the ramifications as an individual, both financially and emotionally, if you keep going down this path.

But, seriously? The ""spat"" was over Abulurd sacrificing HUMANITY'S ULTIMATE VICTORY to save a few million enslaved people (after BILLIONS of innocents had been slain by the purge campaign). if Abulurd hadn't double-crossed all of humanity Ominious might not have been able to send his signal. 

Fuck man, if Gilbertus hadn't put himself on the ship and Erasmus hadn't disabled the mines, humanity could have lost that day and been destroyed shorty thereafter, instead of over 10k years later, all because of Abulurd's moment of conscience.

So V.Atredies hates A.Harkonnen (son of Xavier, who was Vorian's dear friend and brother-in-battle) because of him almost fucking over all of humanity, which was a bit of a harsh judgement made in the heat of battle imo, but also because Abulurd's actions were the polar opposite of what Vorian felt Xavier would have done (ironically, Abulurd did what he though X would have done in his place). And because Vorian probably lived another 300 years and apparently still held this hatred and shared it with his families, who went on to become mostly everyone in the universe, other than the Harkonnens.

Hence why the BG's longterm KH plan required Atriedies and Harkonnen family to be rejoined with Jessica's first daughter (who Paul took the place of) and Feyd-Rautha. Both family lines are obviously volatile and difficult to control when joined, but keeping them with some degrees of separation up to this time of Muad'Dib would have allowed the BG plan to succeed."

imnotminkus,Ohio,1389376695.0,"I'm not completely sure about puppies.  The advice I have is for an adult dog, so take it with a grain of salt, but most should still apply.

A sweater should help if it's the cold that's an issue, especially since she's young and small, but it won't help if she doesn't like snow on her paws.  You can try rinsing her paws with warm-ish water when she comes back inside, to get snow/salt/ice melt off, because that stuff's painful.  Putting on the sweater can be associated with pooping.  You can also try giving her a treat when she successfully poops in the snow.  As a last resort, you can try booties.  Placing her poop in the snow then guiding her to it might help.  If you know she has to go and you give up and go back inside, that teaches her that she has a choice.  Walking or running also tends to make the poop come out.  If the snow comes close to her belly, she might not want to squat and sit in her own poop, which I think is a valid concern, so I'd shovel in that case.

To acclimate her to cold and snow, I'd take her on walks/play with her outside while gradually exposing her to snow/cold.  Play with her with snowballs and such.

SO and I started taking our dog out twice a day, letting him pee/poop in the morning and pee at night.  If we give him more than that, he just marks on things or wanders around sniffing and not pooping.  Accidents very rarely happen.  He's learned that he has one chance to go, and if he wastes it (or saves pee to mark on stuff), he'll have to hold it.  

Here are some other tips I found:  http://puppies.about.com/od/OwnerPuppyCare/a/Cold-Weather-Tips-For-Puppies.htm"
PlushieChomby,relationships,1389376707.0,"I wouldn't immediately jump to the conclusion of ""don't ever contact her again"" based on what you said. She might just not be the most avid texter. I know I get busy and often forget to text someone back whom I meant to text, regardless of how much I like him. When I remember, sometimes enough time has gone by that I get anxious about replying or feel like it's been too long and he's probably either moved on or made other plans. 

On the other hand, there was the weird wallet thing (did she ever find it?), the unreturned voicemail, and days of no initiated texts (though I rarely initiate texting myself but prefer it to phone calls, so again, not something I would immediately declare she has no interest from reading). She did respond that she'd maybe like to do something but might have to work, after all, so she's either still interested but didn't work out a time, or perhaps she *is* dangling a carrot without knowing how to cut the string. 

If you really like her and want to settle this, you might try sending one more text saying something like, ""Hey name, I know we've had some lapses in communication, but I honestly really enjoyed the dates we've had and would love to see you again. However, I don't want to pursue you if you're not interested, as I value both your time and mine and would hate to waste any for either of us, so if that's the case please let me know. Otherwise, I'd love to take you out again when you're not busy with work, and if you'd like to do that, please let me know when a good time for you would be. Either way I wish you the best and do hope to hear from you soon. :)"" 

If she doesn't respond to *that*, she's not interested and at least you actually know you should drop her and move on to greener pastures. If she does reply, her response should give you a better idea of where to go and what to do. It's worth noting that if she's a super busy professional, or someone working two or three jobs, her availability may be sparse and not to your liking even if she's interested in continuing to date. 

You're doing pretty great for a guy who's just starting out dating though, and however it goes with this girl, I've no doubt you'll successfully find whatever you're looking for sooner or later. :) "

laefil,MensRights,1389377047.0,"is there no glass ceiling in norway? because i am pretty sure norway is much more progressive than america is.

my whole point is that feminism is (or should be perceived as) a plight of understanding. men and women should be able to make decisions for themselves and receive support regardless of what sex they are, and should be judged as human beings. i think that the harshness of a man's life is directly proportional to how they are brought up and how they are used. humans in general, if they are not wealthy or of high status, are treated as if they are disposable.

white men are seen as privileged, powerful, and greedy. is this at all true? i don't think so, but how many men are abused by their mothers and/or fathers--and then end up perpetuating that behaviour? how many men are taught that they are and should be privileged and powerful, and that they should take advantage of others? how many men are brought up to believe in a certain ""male integrity"", where they are judged for their capacity as being masculine?

on the flip side, how many women treat others badly based on the way they were treated growing up? do you think that they would not feel powerless too? how many women have eating disorders? how many coloured people use skin treatment to lighten their skin? how many black men resort to gangs to get a sense of power that they feel they lack? how many asian men are expected to be technical or mathematical geniuses?

how many men feel like they aren't allowed to cry? like having ""effeminate traits"" is a symbol of helplessness, irrationality, or tenderness that should only be experienced in very rare circumstances? how many men feel that they are repressing themselves in order to ""fit in"" with a standard of maleness that can cause health/psychological problems?

sexism, racism, genderism, etc. are not confined to what we know of absolute fact. psychology and sociology are both very large parts of it, and both are steeped in ambivalence. it is not going to go anywhere if men and women sit there blaming each other for what the other has or doesn't have. it's better not to focus on ""men vs. women vs. law"", but on ""humans vs. societal expectation"". 

not every feminist blames man for every one of their problems. i am pretty sure it's wrong to do that. 

well, anyway, i understand your points, but i truly believe it goes much deeper than ""haves and have-nots"". i think that men would have a much better time with the system if the system was not perpetuating stereotypes. these stereotypes give an image to men that is not really viable, and then everyone else believes it, which results in the ""feminists"" you hate believing in these images, feminists who have been raised with their own problems and challenges, which causes resentment, which causes social/political stagnancy, etc."

K2TheM,gaming,1389377182.0,"I'm facing a similar feeling with a recent iOS game called Dark District. It's not a bad quasi real time strategy game when you are actually doing something, but it's like the game doesn't want to be played. Like many F2P games, it's built around micro-transactions. The MT in Dark District are basically pay to not wait. Not pay to not grind, or pay for power, but pay to not wait. When building your base/units you can only upgrade/build one building or research one upgrade at a time. Doing this takes time, and that's fine, but the problem comes when you start getting out of the beginner levels. Upgrades can take a long time. The longest wait time for a process to complete I've encountered so far is 28hours. The cost to not wait 28 hours? ~$6 in credits. Since you can only do one upgrade at a time this can mean that without purchasing/using credits (that are used in place of resources and/or to instantly build/upgrade/research things) the game play becomes infuriatingly slow to the point where it's only worth it to fire the game up once a day."

1n1billionAZNsay,TheLastAirbender,1389377622.0,"It would be after Korra had her go.  With the spirits doing what they do and Amon's influence there is a sharp rise with spritual and non bender type fighting.  There are now ""exorcists"" and semi primitive guns being used.  Even people who have bending abilities don't necessarily choose to work on them because there are other more worth while skills to learn.  With all the other stuff that's going on, also there have been a bit more of a rising distrust/disliking of benders and many benders just choose to stay in the closet.

With less benders being in the limelight of people become more and more uneducated and scared of benders so they start arming themselves.  After Korra the next bender is supposed to be an earth bender but the child gets killed in a random act of violence.  Which now makes the next avatar a fire bender.  Luckily for him/her too, because exorcists want to remove the spiritual part of the avatar as they see it as the reason why they had to exist and others want to exploit the Avatar and want to get it as a child.

It is up to Jinora who finds the new Avatar to guide him/her to become the Avatar while, protecting him/her and keeping the fact that he/she is the avatar a secret.  She tries to get help from her family but Ikki is too busy being a politician, Meelo too busy being a celebrity and Rohan being too busy being a skirt chaser and ""trying to repopulate the Air bender population.""

Can Jinora save the Avatar line?  Is bending going to be lost forever?  Would the world be better off without it?"

This story requires a bit of explaining,

First, it's a brony story, sorry those who don't like that. Second, in the brony community, we use the term ""shipping"" as to join 2 characters in a fan made relation(ship). Thirdly, we have this thing where we say ""___ is best ___"" to state our preferences on who is best pony and such.

I was at a convention over a year ago, called canterlot gardens, dressed in a costume as a season 2 villain named discord, lord of chaos. (Aren't i so cool).
Now this fairly attractive girl dressed as a formal white pony known as rarity, sees me walk past and shouts ""discord and rarity is best ship!"". Me without a moments hesitation, keeps walking, points to her, and declare ""yes it is!"" And I keep on my way.

With infantry, you should invest in some AA and some IFV transports for a couple. It is also nice to put your special forces into helicopters.

You should have at least one deck of mortar or arty. You will find the smoke option very valuable. 

Look for a greater variety of tanks to fill in the different needs of the combat zone i.e. tanks with no stabilizers for defending and tanks with stabilizers for forward assaults.

Recon looks fine to me. Put your recon in helicopter. I find it helpful to rush them to the mountain sides to get a bead on the enemy.  

Vehicle looks great although i just want to note that the AMX/MILAN has an autocannon which makes it a great multirole vehicle

I dont know much about planes, but I find napalm to be great.

Whether or not entangled particles communicate, and how fast they communicate if they do, is *not* settled. If they do, they cannot do so faster than light speed.

They do not *affect* their partner; when you measure a quantum particle you can only measure one thing or another according to Heisenberg uncertainty. Entanglement 'breaks' Heisenberg uncertainty because measuring one particle *disallows* you from measuring the second aspect of the second particle.

Thirdly, particles *stay* entangled at distance but they can't *be* entangled at distance, as far as I understand. And once a particle is measured, it is disentangled. The two particles must thus be *isolated* from anything that would change their Heisenberg quantities. You'd need really big tubes through space that the particles don't bump into the sides of. Lose containment and the transmission stops. You would need to isolation *millions* of particles in this way to transmit any significant amount of data. You're also making a big huge assumption about the way entanglement works which is *not* supported in physics, currently.

tl;dr: It wouldn't work."

For your face, stick to sheer foundation or bb cream depending on how good your skin is. Stick to blushes in the pink family. I think a very light contour would be fine too. 

For lips, go with a color that is close to your natural lip color. A lip stain like Benetint might be good.

jjness,holidaybullshit,1389379360.0,"A book cipher lists two sets of numbers usually - page:word 

Page number to turn to : Xth word or letter on the page 

And a reference to which source book to use. I don't recall any mention of a book, or any picture of one, in any of the media we've seen, but perhaps someone can recognize something. 

Looking at the image explaining the semaphore code, I can't help but believe that it is entirely intentional. Therefore, we probably can't use those numbers (in XX:YY:ZZ format) for a book code. Nothing I can do makes sense with these numbers in this endeavor using the Cards Against Humanity PDF. They are most assuredly for the Semaphore Code.

What other numbers might present themselves in this XX:YY format? And what book would we use?

The most obvious keybook is the Cards PDF. Page:Card:Word? Page:Card:Letter? Page:Row:Column:Word/Letter?

Any number set that could be constructed as WW:XX:YY:ZZ or any smaller subset could be used for a book code using the PDF. Similarly, we could treat the different cells of each comic in the FunnyZines with ""row:column"" or ""comic:cell"" or ""comic:cell:speech bubble"" with sets of numbers like this.

with how many wives, children, grandchildren? how many of them lived their lives without knowing their husband or biological father?

The thing about honor is that it's subjective. One man's honorable hero is another man's despot. Historically, he might be either or both, depending on what history you read, who wrote it, who edited it and why.

&gt; Then, out of nowhere, Vor becomes a completely different character when the Bridge of Hrethgir thing became an issue.

this i agree with, i felt like the whole thing was a bit out of character. i felt that the Xavier coverup was enough to qualify the Harkonnen Hate found in the original series.

&gt; Vor just became all, ""DO IT NOW! DO IT NOW! IT MUST HAPPEN NOW!"" out of nowhere.

i agree, my guess is that the book was becoming too long, the war had dragged on long enough and needed a finale (instead of organically coming to a peak in the plot, again great writers vs good).

it was a bit forced, in fact that's the basis of the whole complaint about the nuDune novels. Where FH could draw things out and make plot lines clash naturally, the boys seem to have to force it. I won't argue that Brian Herbert would be no one to care about without his dad, but people have to acknowledge that FH didn't bring a lot more than Dune to the table and he didn't even finish that. imjustsayin'

I did some research and it seems that some lawmakers have looked into curbing this stretch the FAA is making.  A new bill in the house is looking to distinguish the use of unmanned or automated drones vs. radio controlled, locally controlled aircraft; meaning anything that needs to be seen to controlled:radio controlled airplanes etc. or short distance drones, would be excluded from FAA regulations.  The long-distance drones proposed by Amazon or any automated drones over a certain size would be subject to licensing.

My wife and I started in Boston and drove to Arkansas on around $100 of gas then took off west to Cali, then north to Washington, then crisscrossed our way back to Boston stopping at a ton of national parks and random amusing spots.

The [National Park](http://www.nps.gov/findapark/passes.htm) pass was $80 and started saving us money after the 3rd park or so.  With gas basically being paid for by our hotel stays, I would estimate we spent around $2500 for 30 days of traveling including hotels and food.  We definitely could have roughed it and camped in more spots than we did but we live in a tiny studio apartment so being able to stay somewhere with a king or two doubles every once in a while was worth it.

aDDnTN,dune,1389379814.0,"i was totally gonna cite Napoleon as example for my point, but then i realized everyone pretty much thinks of him as the Emperor of France, which is also how his epitaph reads, if i remember correctly. But he was a low ranked commander and only served as a general up into his 30's.

-------------------------------------------------------------

i will restate my original argument. How many Corrino Emperors have there been (by the time of Muad'Dib)? Lots. Emperors, all of them were. So Fayken was the first, which you feel is enough to distinguish him from all those other Corrino Emperors, but what if the historians of the time, felt that what distinguished him from those that came after was his military experience, in particular his role in the Butlerian Jihad. 

or perhaps it pays homage to his Butlerian roots, since that was a military family. or maybe since it's Corrin and not Corrino, it is because the Empire in *the House series* doesn't recognize him as the first emperor. They certainly don't discuss the Bridge of Hrethgir as anything like what it was (there is a play and it is represented by an actual bridge). No mention of what hrethgir is, yet frank and brian both used it.

perhaps there is something in those FH notes that BH &amp; KJA claim to use, but won't release..

That's the point i'm trying to make, **HISTORY IS UNRELIABLE**. And that is repeatedly demonstrated throughout the entire series, nuDune or Original Dune. FH (and his son BH) have, through the vast timelines involved in this series, attempted to demonstrate and show some of the impacts of how history is muddled through time and space.

Rhetorical Questions for everyone, especially Orthodox Herbertarians:

Why would you expect that the writers would get EVERYTHING correct historically, if the people involved in the story don't even have it right? Why do you think this is an error due to poor writing/editing, and not a contrived manner of demonstrating one of the foundations of the dune universe?"

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1389380211.0,"Shifting late and going up hilly terrain means it's getting too hot. When you say it's dumping all the fluid. How much? This transmission holds a shit ton of fluid, and it's physically impossible that it would dump all the fluid.

About how many quarts do you have to put in? It holds like 15-17 quarts or something like that. Torque converter and all.

I would recommend taking it to a transmission shop. Or getting a used transmission. Along with it getting hot, there might be something wrong with the transmission case building up too much pressure and spitting all the fluid out. I've had these problems in my shop before and usually it's solved by just putting a completely different transmission in it.

So you likely have a twofold or threefold problem- the transmission is shifting late and/or not getting into lock-up and the transmission isnt working efficiently letting it overheat. 

You're going up hilly terrain and the transmission is struggling and overheating.

There's something wrong with the trans case not being able to vent properly."

Honestly, take a look through literature - especially classic literature - and try to tell me that men aren't complex individuals. Most of that stuff is by men, about men, for men, and it features plenty of odd, tortured, unpredictable, challenging characters and material. Men are the majority recipients of most arts prizes, which tend to prize complexity.

And that is just one area in which complication is on display and valued. 

Some people are straightforward and transparent, and it's true that we all have the same basic needs in order to survive, but emotionally and psychologically almost everybody is complicated in some way.

Not to get all gender theory on you, but I think this idea that men are simple and women are complicated has a lot more to do with whose ideas are considered the default norm by society."

Banner_Free,Frugal,1389380666.0,"I had a post all written up about how CDMA and GSM phones aren't compatible with each other's networks, and then I realized that the iPhone 4S does in fact have the right hardware to connect to both CDMA and GSM networks.

It is possible to unlock your phone for use on AT&amp;T or T-Mobile, but there are few hoops to jump through. And I'm sorry to say that I'm not exactly sure what those hoops are! But I would try the following, in decreasing order of likelihood of success:

1) Take the phone to an Apple Store and ask them to do the unlock.
2) Take the phone to a T-Mobile Store and ask them to do the unlock.
3) Take the phone to a Sprint Store and ask them to do the unlock.

Be polite, of course, but don't be afraid to be insistent. Most likely they'll tell you, ""no, we can't do that"" at first. Tell them that you've researched the phone and you know that, because it's a world phone, it has the appropriate antenna and baseband for connecting to GSM networks, and the only reason it can't is a software lockout.

If that fails, I see from some quick Googling that you can buy an ""unlock kit"" on eBay that you could in theory use to perform the same operation the store personnel would. I've never done this before, so I can't comment on the likelihood of success or the possible risks associated with it.

If, by whatever means you deem reasonable, you can't unlock your iPhone: My suggestion would be to buy an affordable used phone ([Swappa](www.swappa.com) is a great resource for this) for use on T-Mobile. You can then sell the phone when you're done with T-Mobile service; if it's only been a few months, the value likely won't depreciate by more than $10 or so.

Or, if it's an unlocked phone (e.g. a Nexus 4 or Nexus 5), you might be able to take it with you and use it overseas! But that all depends on which phone you have, which country you go to, etc - more variables than I can account for here :)

I hope this helped! Feel free to reply or PM if you have any more questions."

I'm looking at my health 2014 stuff so I can book with a doctor. I think I'll need a head shrink doctor but I'd like to make sure my baby maker is functional too. Plus I just started a new relationship and I wanna get the paperwork done on my end. This will be literally maybe the first time I've thought before sex ""I need to get tested, you know, for this guy"". Instead of get tested in case some dude gave me an STI.

In other news. I loved my job up until I got this new manager. Now I really really wanna go back to school and never have to work under a manager I hate again because I don't have *enough options* so I'm really strongly looking at a STEM degree so I can maybe probably do front-end web development.

&gt;  Innovation on its own is not enough to keep metal alive.

Unqualified statement. Also stupid. You don't *even* need innovation to keep metal alive - there's lots of great bands doing the same thing, not breaking genre expectations, they're just doing it *better* than the guys before them. Just like the *entire genre* of the blues, which is alive and well.

&gt; Yet the repetition of distorted guitar riffs mobilising augmented fourths, and a limited set of other intervals, is common to both.

He's just fucking wrong. Aggravatingly, painfully, annoyingly wrong. The Gothenburg melodeath bands write in major half the time. There are lots of grindcore bands, *which he references,* whose music is more atonal than anything else.

Clearly Kahn-Harris needs to shut the fuck up and listen to some Anaal Nathrakh.

&gt; musician, producer and theorist Brian Eno 

Fuck off and die, Kahn-Harris. Brian Eno? He's only the *living embodiment of things metalheads hate.*

&gt; Chord

Again, fuck you. Chord is a little masturbatory experiment in drone. Drone is a legitimate genre with lots of good musicians, and you pick some hipster bullshit. How about some *Earth.* SunnO))). Black Boned Angel.

&gt; Author and Punisher

You know what'll *really* be the future of metal? Hipsters making their own instruments in their basements. Clearly not the new movements in melodic death metal which have begun to integrate metalcore guitar styles - something Kahn-Harris has repeatedly refused to acknowledge despite fitting his points perfectly. AaP is a cute project and the music is even okay but it's *pointless.* You can make all that music on a computer just as easily, and arguably make much *more* of it that way.

Oh, right, in Kahn-Harris last article that was posted here, he said we needed *less* music so it would be 'more precious.' Not expanding access so we can drive real innovation.

EDIT: I'm not saying AaP should stop making instruments, that's his thing and it's cool. But it will *never* be the future of drone, doom, or metal in general.

&gt; Ethnamorte

This isn't metal at all. It doesn't resemble metal in any way that matters. Metal has a canon - it is in conversation with its past and present. A band is metal because the metal community likes it. The genres of metal are far too disparate to compare them on any level more than superficial. Ethnamorte is not part of the conversation, it's not metal, and it's a stupid inclusion in an article about metal.

[Oh look - here's a band that fits your point. Did something new. Wrote atonal music with lots of different intervals. Integrated dark ambient and orchestral and industrial and some of the gnarliest black metal ever. Oh what - you've not heard of them Kahn-Harris? You're just a hipster fuck with a limited understanding of metal because you're *totally out of touch with the genre?* You've never listened to anything heavier than WASP for even an hour of your life? Yeah. That's right. I've said it before, and I'll keep saying it. You're out of touch.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92Fvnlr4vkk)"

mooli,climateskeptics,1389381086.0,"I hate this, because it simplifies things so much that it is trivial to dismiss. It is a completely ineffective way of arguing the point.

In reality you'd need a matrix, at least with columns like:

* Happening (Yes/No)
* Sensitivity
* Prevention spend
* Mitigation Spend
* Economic benefits of prevention/mitigation spend (could be negative)
* Combined effect on temperature rise
* Cost at end of century

And then, for each of these fill in a range of scenarios, ranging from:

* AGW is all a big con, but we spent a hundred trillion trying to fix it anyway, what a waste.

Through

* Climate sensitivity is 2.5X, we don't spend enough on prevention and temperature goes up 6 degrees by 2100, the economic benefits outweigh the costs of mitigation, but the spend is dwarfed by the impact cost

Up to

* Climate sensitivity is 4.5, we spend nothing on prevention or mitigation, temps rise 9 degrees by end of century, costs are incalculable.

Assign probabilities to each, etc etc. And then, you have to fight about the probability of each contributing factor every step of the way. And even these hundreds of combinations is a massive oversimplification.

Its just not a useful way to argue the case to anyone but the most ill-informed, and they might one day actually become informed and be *alienated* by this simplistic framing."

superspeck,texas,1389381280.0,"Look at your total tax load before you do that. Compared to, say, the Pacific NW, the Northeast, and several other places I've lived, property taxes outside of a big city in Texas are the least of your worries. Where I currently live, my property taxes are 2.58% of my $120k appraised house, which isn't a tiny amount, but isn't a real big deal - it's about $2800/yr. In Austin, they'll go up a bit, and I'll also have a house that's worth four times as much, so my property taxes will be about $12k. 

Heck, there was a year my dad ""lived"" in Oregon and worked in California, and under those state's laws he owed income tax in both states. Income taxes that year were a third of his income between both states and the feds. (And he had two kids in college!) And he was paying sales tax on everything he consumed in CA, which I think is 10.75%. Property tax in Oregon was also almost 4% at the time due to bond measures; this was 'fixed' by a state initiative a few years later. I'm pretty sure that his entire income that year was absorbed by taxes, mortgage, and tuition. 

By comparison, Texas has reasonable tax rates. There's no income tax. The sales tax is capped, and is avoidable by shopping on sales tax holidays and by buying fresh food, neither of which are taxed. Property taxes depend on how much property you have or consume, and you can choose to own a less expensive property in a cheaper area like I have. If you have/are a corporation, you pay a small franchise tax based on income, and you pay SUTA that you didn't collect from your in-state customers. Texas does not collect sales tax on out of state clients, unlike some other states I've lived in who collect both income tax and sales tax on out of state transactions. 

Moving from Oregon to Texas (as an adult who keeps track of this kind of thing), my tax load went from ~45% to ~23% of my annual income."

K2TheM,cars,1389381423.0,"I've really enjoyed DTM this year. Best part is they have the whole season plus highlight reels, compalations from prior seasons, track overviews, all uploaded to YouTube ([DTM International](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwKq447rYMVI5dAQWMmFnfg)). They even live-stream the races.

It may be one of the higher ""spec"" racing series out there, so it may not be what you are looking for; but the grid is deep, the racing close, and the coverage excellent.

It's become harder and harder to have close competitive racing with widely varied configurations. Part of this is due to rules, part of it is natural converging design. There will (almost) always be a single design of car that will be faster than all the rest. The ""race"" is to see who can figure this out the quickest. While this is fine and good from an engineering standpoint, it makes for boring racing. Heavy spec racing (Indy, NASCAR, DTM, Aussie V8's, BTCC (kinda), and GT500) offers much closer more exciting racing since one team/driver doesn't have an outright mechanical advantage. To that end, Formula 1 isn't really broken... One team has simply found the magic code and run with it. If you remove Vettel from the equation you end up with some actual exciting racing (the fight for 2~6th this year has been excellent). The problem is that there's no easy way to remedy the situation unless someone rises to challenge Red Bull/ Newey. The FIA can contort the rules all they like, but if the most clever designers are all in once place  combined with a well running team garage, it wont matter. About the only thing they *could* do is ban Newey himself from working on Formula 1 cars, like they've banned any other clear mechanical advantage (fans, ground effects, moveable wings, traction control, etc etc etc)."

Maybe it's more helpful to look at it this way: integral from x = 0 to 8 of 2\*pi\*r dx.  This is obviously the sum of all circumferences of the circles of radius r as you go from 0 to 8. But r is the y value, or x^(2/3). That yields integral from x = 0 to 8 of 2\*pi\*x^(2/3) dx. Then the 2pi is simply pulled out as a constant.

So yes, I am saying that the surface area of a curve rotated around the x axis is 2pi times the (unsigned) area between the curve and the axis."

DC just feels more suburban and strangers are more inclined to talk to each other there, I think, whereas in New York the dominant attitude is that the public space functions as an extension of your private space. In a city where people live their entire lives in apartment buildings, often with family or roommates, and then commute to work in large office buildings by taking public transportation, there's not a lot of room for privacy. We have public parks instead of yards, the streets are crowded, *everything* is crowded. On a normal day, you find yourself interacting with exponentially more people than you would if you lived in a small town or mid-sized city. So to compensate, we're all very closed off and not very receptive to chatting with strangers.

This is [Frank](http://i.imgur.com/rgl6KWf.png) My fiance had him when we met. Frank was a shelter cat and for a long time if I wanted to play with him I had to wear oven mitts. He's very funny and likes to gallop through the house. He has skin allergies so when he scratches himself he actually hurts himself, so now he gets those claw caps. I always get him pink :)

This is [Roux](http://i.imgur.com/l4WKmrN.png). In college my friend had a cat wander up to their house and give him kittens. I met Roux when he was 3 days old. He's kind of weird. He's a male calico which is really rare, and his favorite hobby is eating live wires. It's not my favorite hobby.

This is [Smoke](http://i.imgur.com/DuP0xc2.jpg) and the sign that was made to convince my fiance to keep her. She just showed up one day and walked into the house and decided to live with us. When we got her checked we found out she had a home, but when we called they told us just to keep her. It's taken some time but Smoke is finally starting to feel at home. She beats up Roux a lot, even though she's half his size, and spends a lot of time snuggling up to you. She and Frank are besties. 

[Sam](http://i.imgur.com/icRFKzw.jpg) is my buddy. He was a foster that I took in and then I couldn't let him go. We think he's about 10, and a border collie/German Shepherd, but we really don't know. He came from a home of extreme abuse and neglect, which I can't possibly understand. He is the sweetest dog and quite a cuddle whore. His favorite place to be is in your face so you HAVE to pet him. Carl calls him Boyfriend Number 1 because I always say he was there first and thus outranks Carl.

[Molly](http://i.imgur.com/Paqurbg.png) is our pretty little girl (Carl is in there too). She is very much Carl's dog, and at 6 months old is clocking in at 50 lbs. She's very calm for her age though, sometimes, and a very very happy puppy. She's incredibly sweet. And when you drive she puts her head on your shoulder. When we got her she could fit in one hand. 

[Quincy](http://i.imgur.com/zSKW7pp.jpg) is my man. I've wanted a horse since I could walk and talk and I lucked into this dude about 2 years ago. He's beautiful and very sweet. When I fall off he'll walk over to make sure I'm ok. He gets more upset about it than I do. My mom also taught him how to beg for treats.

NotSoSlenderMan,AskReddit,1389382468.0,"I was raised in a ""Christian"" family. I was staying with my aunt for a bit when she had me ""accept"" Jesus Christ into my heart or whatever. I was five years old. I don't really see how I was supposed to understand making a decision like that. So growing up I just went along with it, figured it was what people did. Went to a Southern Baptist church wasn't that big of deal. I liked the food on Sundays and Wednesday night supper, hanging out with friends, youth group, etc.

It wasn't until my teen years that I started questioning things. I'd ask questions during Sunday school and bible study and usually get told to ask my mother or the minister. Started to get annoying. The more questions I had the less answers I was given. Then I a person who worked at the church told my mother that the church was a business first and a church second, which I understand more now but at thirteen that was a horrible thing to me. 

Then there was a time where a building near the church was on fire and the red cross and firefighters were parked at in the church's parking lot. This girl and myself decided to see if we could help and they said that they needed ice. We basically emptied the ice machine bringing them ice. Apparently the pastor told my mother to not let us give them any more.  

I just sort of quit religion. Considered myself an atheist for a bit and hung on everything by Penn Jillette and Richard Dawkins said/wrote/whatever. I liked something I read in one of Penn Jillette's books where he said just as Christians were commanded to in the bible, Athiests should proselytize. But after hearing Stephen Fry talk about not believing in religion the same as not believing in the tooth fairy, I latched onto that idea. I just don't care anymore and want to be left alone by everyone regardless of beliefs. 

Another related anecdote was when I was in Publix looking for my mother and a guy saw that I was wearing a [Punisher](http://imgur.com/1sA9jTA) shirt and said, ""That's really cool. Here look at this."" Now he was this haggard looking, beach bum seeming man so I stopped assuming he had some badass tattoo or pendant when he pulls out a fucking cross necklace and says, ""You like that?! What do you think about that?!"" I wanted to beat his fucking face in. "

gtalley10,facepalm,1389382751.0,"You're right in that the likelihood of catching polio, measles, etc is very very low, and that's *because of vaccines*. Many of these diseases have more or less been eradicated from the 1st world at a minimum. Smallpox basically doesn't exist in nature outside of labs anymore anywhere in the world. Herd immunity protects those unable to vaccinate (and there are legitimate medical reasons why someone can't). The rest of us who can vaccinate help protect them. Not vaccinating because it's safe here is basically kind of selfish without a good reason. [Penn &amp; Teller's Bullshit vaccine bit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhk7-5eBCrs) illustrated this point in a simple way. NSFW language (pretty sure the full episode can be found online, but I can't check videos at work).

That's the real danger of anti-vax. When enough people stop vaccinating, particularly in a localized area, herd immunity is lost, and it isn't even necessarily the anti-vaxxers that suffer the consequences. Your kids might be fine, but it might kill someone else's child. http://danamccaffery.com/openletter.html. 

These are nasty, nasty diseases. They kill and they maim. Hundreds of thousands of people used to be killed by these diseases every year and still do in 3rd world nations. Have you seen an old photo of US president FDR in a wheelchair? That was thanks to polio. When's the last time you met someone with polio? At one time it terrorized the US. The anti-vax movement has thrived because it's been so long since these diseases were everywhere in 1st world nations, thanks to vaccines, that people have forgotten how bad and scary they are.

But all in all, don't take my word for it, definitely don't take the word of some hack pseudo-science website. There are people much more knowledgable about it than me. Talk to your doctor. Saying ""I really don't know"" is fine, but ignorance isn't an excuse to just ignore it. 

You should know that the modern anti-vax movement more or less launched into public with ""Dr."" Andrew Wakefield's fraudulent study on MMR vaccines. The foundation of the whole thing is a lie motivated by nothing but his own greed.

For a long time, I didn't want to leave the house. I didn't want to see anyone. I didn't want to talk to anyone. But after a while, when I felt ready to plug into the world again, it was nice to know my friends were there and thinking of me. Of course, everyone grieves differently.

Anyway, I'd have been more than happy to shove him into her company and turn back to the bar, but we just couldn't hear jack shit. It was a shitty bar and every shitty bar cranks up the music such that you can't talk and consequently you'll drink more. The girls thought we weren't into them, but really we just couldn't hear a fucking thing. The girls bailed, really gracefully actually.

superspeck,PHP,1389383106.0,"A lot of companies that used to use Oracle for data warehousing are using Postgres these days. It scales about as well, does some things better, and does other things worse. But the price is definitely right. 

Later versions (9.1 and up) handle big data and replication better. There's some caveats you should research, such as in-depth explanations of how each data type actually works, how indexing works, and how locking works before you put ""big"" data into it. 

My day job has about 45 Tb of data in Postgres (and growing), another 80 Tb of data in Oracle, and another 300 Tb of data in our legacy sqlite solution that's getting sucked into Postgres. We're not moving the Oracle things into Postgres, but we are doing a lot more of our preliminary number crunching in Postgres and then dumping extracts of that data to Oracle for the reporting logic that the company's based on.

Data processing language doesn't really matter (use whatever you're comfortable with) as long as your database is designed such that it's not going to be locked all the time. That way you can scale out horizontally to a number of nodes and use something like a Zookeeper cluster to manage them. It doesn't matter, if this is your scaling method, how much CPU you use or how 'fast' your code is as long as it is gentle to the database server. "

&gt;You must meet your employer's definition of full-time. However, for PSLF purposes, that definition must be at least an annual average of 30 hours per week. For purposes of the full-time requirement, your qualifying employment at a not-for-profit organization does not include time spent participating in religious instruction, worship services, or any form of proselytizing. 

&gt;If you are a teacher, or other employee of a public service organization, under contract for at least eight out of 12 months, you meet the full-time standard if you work an average of at least 30 hours per week during the contractual period and receive credit by your employer for a full year's worth of employment. 

&gt;If you are employed in more than one qualifying part-time job simultaneously, you may meet the full-time employment requirement if you work a combined average of at least 30 hours per week with your employers.

&gt; They're always trying to mock Islam and Muslims.

Same as above, sure. They certainly will take the worst examples of Salafi Jihadis or extremists and then pull the whole ""they are the 'true face of Islam' because Islam is evil"" or something like that.

&gt; They're always trying to destroy Islam.

Subjective accusation. They are acting like idiots out of their antipathy towards it for whatever reason.

&gt; They're always pro-West, pro-democracy, anti-caliphate.

Nothing wrong with being ""pro west"" unless you're letting the Americans bumfuck you or something. Nothing inherently wrong with ""western"" or globalized cultural attributes either, unless you take it to the extreme end, which hardly anyone ever does. 

It's a virtue to be anti-caliphate if the people pushing for the caliphate are disgusting Salafi Jihadis or the even-more-odious takfiri. That's why so many people in the MENA and elsewhere are against any form of Islamism that shows itself to be conservative/Salafi Jihadi oriented, anti-modern, or otherwise is characterized by a refusal to deal with the violent ones who want to slaughter all of the Shias or the Sunnis who aren't insanely conservative/wahhabist/Salafist and all of the other religious and ethnic minorities.

Nothing wrong with nationalism, at least in the positive sense-- as in people being proud of every positive or decent thing about their countries. But the black flag caliphate-desiring conservative Islamist really only play into the hands of the ""new atheist/anti theists"" who make zero distinction between a secular nationalist Muslim and the very worst sort of Wahhabi."

FreyjaSunshine,skeptic,1389383511.0,"[Here is a link](http://www.sprocket-trials.blogspot.com/) to a blog that has some interesting information on what happens following brain death.

An excerpt:

*From: The Paradox of Brain Death, by Pauline W. Chen*

*While normal brain tissue is firm, a brain that has been dead shows progressive autolysis, a form of biological self-destruction. “It will almost be like soup,” Dr. Harry Vinters, chief of neuropathology at UCLA, recently explained to me. He is the co-author of a major textbook on the pathology of the brain and has performed almost a hundred autopsies on the brain-dead. “It really depends on how long they have been on the ventilator. If they have been on the ventilator for two days, then the brain is grey and softened. But if, for example, a family has had difficulty deciding what they want to do and the patient has been kept on the ventilator for two to three weeks, then there’s tremendous autolysis. The brain gets very swollen, soft, and mushy.” The nerve tissue can become so friable that fragments of brain from the head will break off and float down the spinal column. “Sometimes I’ll be looking at a slide of the spinal cord,” says Vinters, “and I’ll see fragments of cerebellum floating around in the specimen.”* 

So yeah, she's decomposing, starting with the brain.  The rest of her organs will fail eventually.  She may go into DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) where clotting factors get used up and then no clotting can occur and she just bleeds from any wound, her GI tract, etc.

Banner_Free,Frugal,1389383604.0,"As I've said in a few other comments: It's important to consider all the variables, evaluate all the potential solutions, and see what works best for **you**. I can provide general knowledge on the subject, but I can't make any guarantees about how well that knowledge will apply to your own specific situation.

That said, here are some thoughts:

The main (only?) reason I would discourage someone from using T-Mobile service is poor coverage in their area. I've never had coverage issues in the SF/Bay Area, but I do know folks - especially in rural areas - who've tried T-Mo and switched back to ATT/Verizon because they just didn't get any signal.

So, ask around and see what you can find out about quality of T-Mobile coverage in your area. Make sure there's good reception at your home, at all of your workplaces/schools/etc.

I also estimated your T-Mo costs based on the assumption that you'd want new phones at $0 down. If you buy used phones for some/all of you from a site like [Swappa](www.swappa.com), you can bring down that monthly bill significantly.

(If you bring your own phone, you can also use the $30/mo prepaid plan with 100 minutes, unlimited text, unlimited data. The low minute count means it's not an option for most folks, but I just thought I'd put that information out there.)

If T-Mobile simply isn't an option, see if an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) would work. Those are companies that lease spectrum/service from the major carriers (ATT/Verizon/Sprint) and sell it to you at competitive prices. Check out Net10 Wireless, Straight Talk, Ting, Page Plus, Republic Wireless, etc. You'll likely end up with a higher up-front cost for phones (since they don't offer device financing), but significantly lower monthly bills.

Definitely feel free to reply/PM me if you have any more questions!

**TLDR:** Go with T-Mobile if their coverage is good. Bring your own phones if you want to save more. Check out MVNOs if T-Mo won't work."

By 'accidentally' I mean that I didn't realise that I was already in the club as I work in kgs and never really did the conversion or consider it a big thing outside of the internet and only converted to lbs to talk to some people online about it.

I tested a 13.1 time a while ago I ran it in 2 hours and 12 minutes. Not brilliant, obviously, but it was at the end of my endurance focused base building phase. I just wanted to check that I in fact had enough endurance to run it in a reasonably decent speed. I didn't really go all out and felt I could have continued running afterwards but chose to stop as I didn't want to injure anything and lose a week.

Anyway, to the training. I initially started off doing a 5/3/1 one lift/day twice a week split and mashed some elements of Hal Higdon's running program together.

But then I read[ http://www.completehumanperformance.com/so-you-want-to-run-endurance-training-for-strength-athletes-part-1.html](http://www.completehumanperformance.com/so-you-want-to-run-endurance-training-for-strength-athletes-part-1.html) which really helped with my programming as I entered a higher intensity phase and begun adding more speedwork, it's also helped me improve my squat again. During my previous training my squat numbers basically stayed stagnant for most of the period, although my deadlift and bench continued moving up. I do wish I'd read it before, I'm really not advanced enough to be trying to develop a combination running/lifting program together.

It's definitely worth a read but the jist of it is to to use Westside Conjugate Periodisation so that you can do all your max effort days and speed work at one end of the week with the dynamic effort days endurance running at the other end. I've found it's been great so far, particularly in getting my squat numbers to begin moving again. I also feel much better rested for my runs and I've generally been running them faster. I'm quite confident that I'll be able to get out a 1:40-1:50 half marathon time this year. I think I might be capable of faster but I can't really judge the endurance required yet as I've never ran more than a 10k so I don't want to risk a DNF.

So I'm an alright guy, right? Not really one of those dashing chaps like the glamorous shows on telly would lead the rest of the world to believe, just trying to do my job with my dignity intact, like the rest of us. Scotland Yard, Forensics. I do my duty so London can rest easy at night and all that.

But that *bloody* maniac is always barging in on the scene of the crime, trampling over my evidence, blithering on about weather conditions and brands of hand soap and all that nonsense, and possibly worst of all, discrediting me in front of my team. What a prat. He thinks he's genuinely better than the rest of us because he's solved a case or two on his own. He isn't smart, he's just a psychopath with too much time on his hands and an ego the size of the bloody Gherkin.

... Well, I mean, he *did* end up leading us to the body of that one 'serial suicide' killer. Fancy John being there as well- A Study In Pink, he called it on his blog. He'd be an alright bloke if he weren't in love with *him*. And yeah, he did do the aluminium crutch thing, and Reichenbach thing, and the bombings, and that crazy dog thing over at Baskerville, and I get the whole Moriarty whatever, but that doesn't give him any right to act the way he does.

Det. Inspector Lestrade keeps him around, though. God help me, the next time I see Sherlock bloody Holmes, I'm going to quit."

It's not a manifestation of Islamophobia to think that the likes of Al Nusra or the Salafi Jihadi front are stupid scumbags, taking into consideration that not everyone who joins these organizations are ""true believers"" in terms of takfirism or the Salafi Jihadi ideology.
