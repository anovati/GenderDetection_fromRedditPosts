It could be the same thing over and over, but I wasn't allowed to leave until I could pick out something I genuinely thought was good about my appearance. Then I would look at that thing and appreciate it. After a while, I trained myself to seek out my positive features first, which really changed the way that I looked at myself overall.

Once I knew a girl who had a tendency to talk down about her appearance a lot. Every time her best friend caught her doing it, she made her say, out loud, 3 things she liked about herself. Every time. I think if you could train yourself to do that without prompting - think 3 good things for every bad thing - that would help a lot too."

spongebib,openbroke,1388653002.0,"This whole thing often leads to kind of frustrating discussions. I mean, feminism and ""society"" aren't saying that all women shouldn't work in the home, have children, cook---whatever. Feminism largely has just been about trying to get more opportunities and choices for women, and that actually does (or, at least, it *should*) include the choice to take on domestic duties. Honestly, work in the home is very important even if it isn't valued by the capitalistic structure. It's just that these days there's more focus on women's roles/work outside of the home, but that doesn't mean that work in the home isn't important. It is, but it's also important that it's not the **only** choice or opportunity for women.

But all of that seems lost on most of these discussions here on reddit. Instead they just get the pitchforks ready for feminism (despite often not fully understanding what feminism actually is)...though now that I'm actually reading through more of the comments, they're not as bad as I'd anticipated!

one reason many people avoid schoolwork is because they feel inadequate about their ability to do it correctly or well even if they didn't procrastinate. doing the work forces you to face that inadequacy, which is unpleasant. this is why people avoid doing it until they're forced to. 

two things that might help:

- understand the above thought process, knowing that the only way to get better at something is to do it a lot, and that struggling at that thing is not a sign of your lack of intelligence
- have long-term goals that you actually want to achieve, that aren't arbitrary. i want to go to medical school. my gpa is on the lower end of acceptable for just about every medical school, so i have to study really hard for the mcat to make that a possibility. i don't find myself procrastinating on studying for it each day. essentially, if you really want something, it becomes easier to take steps towards that thing.

It was massively full of fan service... the kisses, the parents, all the little references and nuances that could only be noticed by someone who'd been frequenting the fan communities... AND I feel like the fan service might have been placed there specifically to throw us off the real scent of things, like:

* Why was Mary sent the text and not Sherlock?
* How did Mary figure out the code so quickly?
* Why did Sherlock deduce her as a liar?

I have a feeling we're going to reference back to that more than anything else for the overarching plot of series 3. The terrorist plot was more meant to get Sherlock's blood pumping in time with London's again, than it was to be any real continuing plot. I DID like that they finally used Moran though, even if he was a completely different character than the ACD Moran... it also wrapped up any questions about where he was, since he was supposedly Moriarty's Main Man.

Also, I'm 99.99% sure they haven't actually told us the real way he did it.

I read [this printing](http://www.amazon.com/Beowulf-Verse-Translation-Bilingual-Edition/dp/0393320979) of the Seamus Heaney translation for a college course in Old English. It's exactly as you describe, except by pages rather than columns (the left page is in OE and the right page is in ME).

As its inclusion in my course would suggest, yes, it's a great format for understanding how the language evolved. However, Heaney did take a more ""feel""-based approach to the translation, as opposed to staying exactly faithful to sentence structure and vocabulary. That means that lots of things aren't going to look recognizably similar, because he often chooses a ME word that reflects the intended meaning of the OE word, rather than the ME word that is etymologically related to the OE word. He also takes more liberties with phrasing and sentence structure in general. But this makes it a little easier to read the story, and with a decent OE-to-ME dictionary, you can still have a very rich experience as far as etymology goes."

Cilvaa,pics,1388658569.0,"Aussie here. We have a public healthcare system, which is supplemented by private health insurance, which I have. In 2009 I had appendicitis (rapid onset) and had to get my appendix out.

I opted to go to a private hospital, rather than a public one (which would have been completely free) because it was 1:30am, I was in agony and the paramedics told me that I would likely get seen to faster in a private emergency room.

Here's a summary of my expenses using Australia's PRIVATE insurance-based healthcare system:

* Got an ambulance ride to the hospital for free.
* My 10 hours spent in the emergency room left me out-of-pocket $190.
* The anaesthetist cost was $250 (insurance policy excess).
* The surgeon's cost was $300 (after insurance and public healthcare rebates).
* The main hospital bill was $500 (insurance policy excess), including food and medications/antibiotics/painkillers.

My total out-of-pocket was $1240. A far cry from this $11k monstrosity. That said, if I'd gone to a public hospital, it would have been totally free (in the sense I would not get a bill, but the costs are recovered as part of the Australian Tax System that we all pay)."

I'm just glad that any case of a guy getting hit in the nuts purposefully was taken seriously. It was always a girl doing it and the only time that they didn't say they just felt like it was due to her checking to see if what one of her friends told her was right, it would end with the guy on the ground in the fetal position (her friend was right).

&gt; Modern proposals for a GAI have usually taken two basic forms that reflect these very different purposes and an infinite number of variations. The form usually favoured by people who place a high value on simplification and work incentives is the negative income tax (NIT). This is a payment by governments to persons or households below certain income level as opposed to positive income taxes which are paid to governments by persons with income above a certain level. The NIT was initially conceived by the American economist George Stigler, in 1946 (George Stigler, ""The Economics of Minimum Wage Legislation,"" American Economic Review (1946) pp. 358-365.), as another way of achieving the objectives of minimum wage legislation, and refined by another American economist, Milton Friedman, in 1962 (Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962).), into a full-scale alternative to all social assistance and income support programs.

&gt;The second form of GAI is the universal demogrant (UD). This is a payment to all persons regardless of income. It is usually favoured by those who see the GAI as a right of citizenship and whose purpose is to eliminate poverty and lead to more equal sharing of the economic benefits of society. This approach to a GAI received its classic description by another American economist, Robert Theobald, in his 1965 book, Free Men and Free Markets. (Robert Theobald, Free Men and Free Markets (New York: Anchor Books, 1965).)

predalienmack,howtonotgiveafuck,1388659775.0,"As a guy that has just turned 20 years old who has also never had a gf (except for some bullshit half-assed dating relationship I had for a couple of weeks during my junior year of high school and some flings so far in college), I can kind of see where you're coming from, just with a half decade less of loneliness and I'm guessing a different outlook on my own situation in comparison to how you view your own, mostly because I have the opportunity to observe many friends who are quite successful at getting into dating relationships with desirable women. 

I get that the feeling of hopelessness that is spurred from thinking that you won't have a significant other in the future is truly shitty. The complete absence of confidence that results from a continual lack of experience with girls is a hard thing to battle, as well. These feelings result in the worst ""realization"" of all: that even if you did find someone that is really compatible with you and that you wanted to make the moves to date, you wouldn't know what to do/would be afraid to act accordingly to get with that girl, which is an ultimately crippling situation to be in mentally. 

On that note, I think your problem specifically is with your mindset. You are thinking far too much about the past (which in this case, shouldn't be on your mind at all because it seems like you don't have many incredibly useful experiences to fall back on in this department) and the future (which should take up only a little bit of your time no matter how you're feeling), as opposed to living in the moment so you can actually get something done about your problem. 

Another problem with your mindset is that you also talk about wanting to kill yourself (or having similar depression-associated feelings) because you haven't had a SO, which indicates that you are tying your self worth and happiness with whether or not you get into a dating relationship, when happiness, first and foremost, must come from within, and happiness with yourself will need to come before you date someone else.

To be happy and to be successful with girls (from my observations, conversations with friends who are successful, and from my somewhat limited personal experiences), you have to get into the mindset that you are worth dating, that you are an intelligent, confident, and satisfied person that simply wants the icing on the cake: a person that will compliment your mindset and reinforce it; a person that will help you enjoy life more than you already are enjoying it. Steps you could take towards becoming that person are: thinking positively and confidently at all times (fake it 'til you make it), in situations where you're going to approach a girl you have an interest in, don't think, do, and what may be the most helpful is finding a hobby that you have a passion for that involves interacting with other people, hopefully at least some women. For me, that hobby is clubbing/going to big shows/festivals (mostly EDM-related). Living the club life is a great ice breaker and I've met several really awesome girls over the times I've gone to various events, as an example. I'd recommend it, especially if you enjoy concerts.

Back to the subject of your mindset: I've struggled with depression in the past for a variety of reasons (not being good with girls being one of the primary factors) and I assure you, most girls don't want to deal with someone who is emotionally unstable in that manner (girls often have enough emotional baggage as it is), but if you come across as that guy who has his shit figured out (and who actually does, at least in the moment), you'll be able to get into a healthy dating relationship with some nice girls out there based solely on believing in yourself and demonstrating that you do to girls that you are interested in. 

I will stress this, though: you have to have a little peace of mind before going into a relationship, because if you don't have your own shit figured out as you go into a relationship  and are constantly worrying about if it's going to work out or if you've invested all of your emotional stability on this new SO, chances are the relationship will be really unhealthy and fail rapidly from what I've seen, which will make you even less happy than you are feeling right now. 

Sorry for the mini-novel.

TL;DR - Basically, you've gotta work on your happiness and self confidence (if necessary, fake it 'til you make it) from within while living in the moment to get your mind off your previous struggles with this sort of thing and the result will be that things will progress towards the better and you'll be able to make the necessary moves, in time."

When I play games, I'm not constantly thinking of myself as a puppeteer, I'm living as the character, and hence the whole ""wanting to protect her"" thing never made any sense to me.

I guess there's two interpretations then; if you believe the marketing - the game is a bit problematic, as she *is* thrown into some situations that make her pretty vulnerable and almost pathetic, which comes off as pandering to men who want to do the protection thing.

However I tried to view it without that influence, and I found it goddamn awesome - it was the story of a woman who WAS vulnerable and needed protecting, but  then through her experiences grew into someone pretty badass. Your sentiment of ""HECK YEAH LARA WE DID IT TOGETHER WE TOOK THAT GUY DOWN WE CAN DO THIS!"" is exactly how I felt. :)

And to give the developers the benefit of the doubt, maybe that's just what they meant? I know that I was definitely willing her on, supporting her the entire time, so maybe their marketing team just put in patronising terms and made everyone look a bit silly."

This was also literally the first point I've ever scored in practice so, pretty excited. I bridged to escape from... well it was all pretty hectic, but I habitually go for lapel and collar grips whenever I'm working for a position on the ground. After a turnover, or something, I spun over top and had a decent position for an arm bar with him on his back, but had the grip on his bottom lapel still. It was the second time I was surprised to get a grip I liked, and deep. Well I finished turning into position and set my leg over his head a la the arm bar, but grabbed onto the lapel instead with my grip levered on my leg. I couldn't lean back the same way but had the choke solid, and pushing my leg away only pressed the choke tighter. I settled into place and realized the position was good (though I was laying away above his shoulder rather than straight), but he didn't seem to react. So I took a breath, gripped hard, and pulled hard. Still no reaction so I tightened up and pulled with everything I had. I knew it was good but he wasn't budging so all I could do was attack full power, then finally after what seemed like 10 seconds (guessing 3 actual) he tapped. On reflection I don't think I had body control and he was definitely tired, but he told me he at first thought he'd rather defend the choke than the arm bar. I didn't realize at the time.

zarook,Cumberbitches,1388660692.0,"This is about to get long... I'm sorry. &gt;_&lt; Don't hate me for writing a novel.

I understand where your disappointment might stem from, a seeming lack of things that would move this series forward, but the more and more I think about it, I think ""What else could they do but exactly what they did?"" 

My reasoning is kinda this: *We've been agonizing as a fandom for TWO YEARS about how he did it, and how John would react.*

If the episode hadn't been dedicated to a dialogue on that, the fandom would've been outraged... if they'd just swept it under the rug, like ""Well, John punched him, and then they hugged, it was a mannequin the whole time... quite right, anywhooooo... So there is this guy, Magnusen, lets set him up... he is our focus now... no no, don't think about the past, onward, forwards, new plots!""

I dunno about you, but I would have felt really cheated, really ""Thats IT? Thats ALL we're saying on this? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?""

So yes... while it might not have moved it forward very much into the overarching plot line of this series, I think for the massive amounts of build up over Richenbach, they handled it quite well. 

They were working in an area that ACD didn't address, they had challenges that ACD flat out ignored. They gave us Sherlock's death where we could see it, and they gave us a reaction from John that was appropriate not just for a person, but specifically for John as Martin portrays him, in relation to Benedict's Sherlock. Scattered, not really... if you take in to account all the things being factored in here:

- **The whole episode was about bait and switch:**

 - Sherlock's explanations/~~Anderson~~ Phillip's Theories, 
 - Anderson's fake Ripper case as a distraction from the underground terrorist cell,
 - Bomb being off when Sherlock was pretending it was on, 
 
- **The bomb wasn't the real case being presented here, it was John being taken.**
 - The terrorist cell was the ultimate bait and switch, its not the case at all... 
  - John being taken instead of Sherlock, 
 - Text being sent to Mary instead of Sherlock, 
 - Mary figuring out the code quickly and on her own.
 - We were paying attention to the bomb, when really, we needed to be paying attention to the kidnapping.
 

 
 NOTHING in this episode is was it actually seemed to be, from Sherlock's death to what the case actually was in this episode. It was all bait and switch, and that, was the real overarching theme that prevented it from being scattered.

Cinematography wise... I'm not a huge film person... personally I liked it. I especially preferred how they handled the scenes where he was obviously in his mind palace, versus that cheesy crap they did in Baskerville. 

And they kept the over arching visual themes of quick cuts, super close ups with zero personal space between John and Sherlock, desaturated color palette, motion graphics existing within a three dimensional space in relation to the actors... etc. 

I would really like to know the differences you saw that you didn't like, because I'm wondering what I missed that would be considered different.

throw-away-today,MensRights,1388663310.0,"I think it's kinda funny in a way. I was close to unsubscribing a while back because of some awfully sexist comments. (I decided to stay because I still passionately care about men's rights)

Yet, here I am about to defend this sub, because I totally understood why this was posted here. 

I'm female but I still felt pain down there in sympathy. I just don't understand the lack of empathy to write that sentence as the hook. It would be like writing ""one girl is not gonna need lube tonight, the blood from her horrific attack will do it for her!"" (I never claimed to be punny). I think the issue here isn't an unfunny pun, it's a deep double standard that somehow it's okay to joke about violence against men. 

This is just one illustration, there are countless more (including sexual abuse). Not thinking twice (or worse, thinking it's okay) to make a joke that spits in the face of an 18 year old with a mutilated penis...maybe some people will think differently and find it okay, but I honestly can't come to terms with it. 

He's 18 and was essentially tortured and mutilated. The author's response was a pun? Would that be the same if it was a female? If the answer is no, than that is an issue because it points to a clear, sexist difference in the attitudes of society towards men. And I thought that's what this sub was about. 

It's not fair and it's not right. It devalues the male sex organ (which is super fucking sensitive, as almost everyone knows) and basically says ""it's okay to joke about this"". It shows a lack of empathy and a lack of compassion. It's kicking a kid while he's down and it's inadvertently making a joke out of male genital mutilation (which a lot of people don't take seriously, already). It wasn't funny and it was cruel and it was only considered okay because the victim was a male. To me, that's an issue worth this sub. "

This could even lead us to develop interstellar travel much sooner, possibly using the proposed nuclear pulse method. Just a thought. While I find this algae oil idea interesting, I do think that ultimately it is a waste of time and only works to prolong our reliance on oil. The finite nature of oil forces us to discover alternatives, preferably alternatives which are cheap, renewable and clean.

GoldReaper,gifs,1388665259.0,"This reminds me of my graduation party. My uncle *loves* fireworks and buys them every year, so for my graduation party he went all out. Unfortunately, everyone (including him) was *extremely* inebriated when it was finally time to do fireworks. So my uncle and my cousins (his kids) go out into the field to light the first firework. They're stumbling and I'm too far away to do anything about it and too drunk to really ponder how to stupid it is for them to be firing off fireworks in such a drunken state. 
 
I start walking over towards the keg (which is by the edge of the field) with this girl I was flirting with, when all of the sudden these huge balls of sparkly fire blast out across the field. I don't mean into the air, I mean like fifty sparkly fireballs are bouncing outwards from the launch location on the ground and a lot of them are headed towards the crowd of people by the house.
 
It was at this point that time began to slow. I'm standing there with this cute girl who I have been trying to hookup with since middle school and all I can see are these fireballs careening towards a crowd of people (and myself). I felt like time had stopped at this point as I said, ""oh fuck,"" to myself. That's when the fireballs exploded into beautifully terrifying fireworks. That's right. Exploded.
 
Time began to regain consciousness as the last of the fireballs went off in the distance. Fortunately for us they hadn't gone off close enough to anyone to cause harm, but shit was that close. Afterwards I ran up to my uncle and my cousins to stop them from lighting up more fireworks, and in the process lost the girl to a really high friend of mine. A depressing end to a scary, albeit extremely fun, party."

The hook: Any way you cut it, this is one tight story and we're sure [woman] is feeling a little sore around the edges tonight. 

It's just not funny. It's insensitive, it's disgusting, and it's not acceptable! 

I totally understand your pov. Sometimes I totally agree with people of here and other times I sit and shake my head. But, I always try to understand.

-----

Also, dumping this here, if you read a lot of the comments, there are some really fucked up ones: 

""Funny how the rapists always get away with it, but when the person who confronts the rapists issues any kind of violence... they get penalized for it!"" (implying the victim was a rapist with no evidence but a drugged up sadistic woman).

""This man's life isn't destroyed, he's apparently still alive. But I faved your comment anyway because I agree that it's not funny in the slightest."" (I seriously doubt this argument would come up if it was a female victim, the rape didn't *destroy* her, she's still alive. That's obviously not what the original commentator meant)

""I'm a woman and I think she's mentally unstable and shouldn't have children. I feel bad for the man, I hope he recovers well and that she gets the sentencing she deserves."" (*I feel bad for him* is probably one of the most underdeveloped responses to this story.)

""You rarely hear women calling for the execution of rapists since we already know we'll barely get justice in most cases. Now sit down and stop playing fast and loose with a crime that goes not only under reported but under convicted."" (Telling someone to ""sit down"" because they're speaking up for a male victim is just ridiculous).

""Not condoning what she did.. but, she did give him his choice... lol"" (seriously?)

""WOW If he's guilty They he's blessed it was just his junk she cut off Drop all Charges On Her if the guy is guilty!""
and
""Well Duh I was just Saying That's what any normal Loving parent would have don't..I know the law Thanks..""

""In Bible times child molesters were stoned to death. However since we no longer live in Bible times we must let the powers that be deal with it, regardless of how bad the due process is. Certainly it has been long proved that smoking weed make one paranoid. 

We need the Kingdom of God to take over mankind's affairs &amp; bring Divine Justice.""

Gain some confidence and experience with them.  Who knows? It might lead to a relationship or two.  Just make sure they aren't married and use condoms as they may not be responsible with birth control right now.

Women talk, and have a wider variety of associates but few true friends they trust.  Their is no such thing as bad advertisement.  Even a bad date or a bad hook up generates interest as many women are as alone as you are. Soon you will be known as a great guy and women well pursue you.  It happened to me at new years with a woman who brought a date that is half my age. She still came up and just had to touch me.  Why?  I've become a great guy in our group.

Depends on who you talk to, and which prophet. I agree that it is somewhat esoteric, though.

&gt;Incorrect as well.

I disagree. The temple ceremony clearly points towards subservience. I agree that difference in roles does not necessarily mean inequality, but in this case I think it does. I understand your point of view, though.

&gt;Speculation on the form that the punishment takes.

I agree. I've heard that the pain of being in a lower Kingdom will be kind of a self-inflicted pain? Because we knew that we were capable of more? I'm not sure.

&gt;Categorically false.

I agree, I was wrong. I conflated the Mormon god with the standard biblical Christian god. As far as Mormon theology goes, this is one of those that I really admire, that nearly everyone will go to some level of Heaven. Thanks for pointing out my error.

&gt;Unless you err in thinking that there is no leeway whatsoever. I've wondered about that as well.

I've tried to find a way out, but haven't yet. We just need more information. I'm very open (and hopeful, if God is real) that I'm wrong in my thinking.

&gt;Maybe such a thing is possible in Mormon heaven as well? If you ask god to cease to exist is there any reason why he can't/won't grant you your wish?

I sure hope so. At least, I hope so on this mortal plane. Maybe we'll get to heaven and find out something that will make us want to live forever?

Anyways, we're kind of off-topic. I appreciate the honest and candid discussion. Even if we disagree pretty substantially, you've always been consistent in your beliefs. I'll probably argue with you again, but I'm really trying not to be such a jackass about things that I disagree with."

GuyWithNoHat,sex,1388668782.0,"Recently, I haven't ""needed"" the porn that much.  In fact it's been probably a month now since I've seen any.  This is because my wife has been a lot more giving as of late, and my needs are being fulfilled.

I've resigned myself to expecting a life with no threesomes, not by choice however, but because my wife is an amazing woman and I'll honor and respect her wishes about it.  I can be content with what I have, even if I occasionally daydream about ""what ifs"".

I always laugh at the ""because biology"" reaction.  It's like saying ""I don't understand science or innate desires"".  It just sounds jaded, that's all.  Similarly, we could analyze the phenomenon of why women made 50 Shades of Gray hugely successful, despite its poorly written pages and S&amp;M antics with a billionaire.  We'll use your expression to explain it -- ""because biology"".

For me, I have similar hangups about women that watch romantic films. At least in the sense that I won't ever look like Ryan Gosling, we won't ever have some romantic ""love conquers all"" moment, and for the love of God, there better not be any moments of me trying to compete against Mr. Wrong for the love and attention of my wife.  Romantic films set an expectation level that I find unrealistic and unsustainable.  They preach to you that your love life is boring.

dirtyewok,coys,1388668974.0,"I think ultimately it will be Eriksen in a CAM role with Lamela on the right and Andros on the left (remember he played his full career on the left until recently). Chadli and Lennon will continue to be cogs that fit as needed dependent on the situation. 

In the short term i think Lennon is playing at a level to deserve time on the pitch, and while i don't think it is a permanent solution the lopsided attack is working as well. As much as we all love to say that Lennon is the weak link (as we have for the past several seasons) because he can't finish, he has a horrible final ball, all he does is sprint etc, the guy continues to show that for all the flaws he may have in his game, we just play well with him in the lineup.

I like how Eriksen has been playing on the left, but the lopsided formation at the same time concerns me. Because we seem to be removing some of the defensive responsibilities from Eriksen and allowing him to roam the pitch to create we are putting a huge amount of pressure on Rose at LB defensively. 

Against a team like Stoke it wasn't an issue (also helped that Stoke looked bad even for Stoke) as John Walters couldn't take advantage of the space that was available. Fryers was easily able to deal with the rare attack that actually came from Stoke. It just worked in our favor.  

Against United we saw Rose get run ragged by Valencia and Januzaj and our central defense play a massive game to counter that pressure. But you can imagine that virtually every team we have coming up will attack the same way if we put that lineup on the pitch and the matches we have coming in the short term (City, Arsenal, Everton, Swansea) can all exploit space on the left.

Short term, what we are doing seems to be working, but it leaves us exposed.  But with a huge list of injuries and a new manager i wouldn't expect us to be able to discover what our actual best formation/lineup is for a little while."

It's not a theory. Gilligan's use of color was intentional and he's spoken about it a few times. 

""I want to do the color timing for each of these episodes where you sit with the colorist and make sure that the color of each individual scene is just the way you want it.""
―Vince Gilligan, IndieWire interview, July 2012

This is from the wiki. I figured copy and pasting is safer, since it's easy to accidentally spoil something by just skimming the page.

The relationships between the central Breaking Bad characters are analogous to the relationships between colors on the red, yellow, and blue painter's color wheel. For example, the color for Walter's alter ego, Heisenberg, which is often green, is created by mixing the colors of his two closest partners, Sklyer, who often wears blue, and Jesse, who often wears yellow. Further, Heisenberg is opposed by Hank, who often wears shades of orange, ranging from red to brown, which is located on the opposite side of the color wheel from green. Marie, being the sister of Skyler and wife of Hank, is represented by purple, which sits between blue and red colors on the color wheel.

They aren't dead, as a matter of fact, until the plane crashes (although there are enough people who survived plane crashes) or you shoot it down.

&gt; They can tell based on altitude and velocity, among other things, that a plane is headed for a city.

Because there is a highjacking-autopilot that conveniently flies the plane into the next big crowd? The 9/11-terrorists had to take pilot's lessons for a reason (and the German authorities warned the FBI about some Mohammed Atta who only practiced in-flight situations, but no starts or landings, by the way).

And how much loss of life is enough to start killing innocents?  
You might not be able to evacuate Manhattan, but certainly you could evacuate the Pentagon rather fast.  
What about a plane headed for Mt. Rushmore? Stone faces aren't people, but the propaganda value of these pictures would be enormous. Would it be right to actively kill innocent people to stop a PR-debacle from happening?

dirtyewok,coys,1388672413.0,"Personally i think Rose (from what we have seen) is just a flat out better player than BAE. So i don't think BAE would benefit us more than having a serviceable backup at LB so that we can rest (and cover for injury) Rose. Also keep in mind that BAE was...very poor the second half of last season, so much so that we started opting for Naughton on the left.  At QPR i have seen mixed reviews for his play, with some saying he was great and others saying he was poor (one of my friends is a season ticket holder at QPR and he continually says that BAE is inconsistent and looks like a championship player...but my friend is also a bit of a muppet so who the hell knows), so who knows what we will be getting back.

I would prefer that we just leave Jan in the middle, he has done as asked for us, now lets get him back to where he is strongest.

Really, we can take the chance of being exposed on the left in some matches. But i would hope that once we start getting a healthy squad back Sherwood would adjust his strategy depending on opponent. 

We can pull the light left side against some teams, but against a team like City with Navas (or depending on health, Arsenal with Walcott) the thought is....unsettling and sounds like a it spells a very difficult day for Rose that could really challenge the squad defensively."

is just not true. It is not hard at all, if you're looking for them. Meetups, certain dating or common interest webistes and clubs actually make it very easy to find someone in the community. And then once you get your foot in the door, make a connection or two, it is a very network based community. You'll find many many more by spending time with your newly made friends. 

Now, if you're not trying to find them, yes you could potentially never find out that you have poly/nonmonogamous people in your life. No one I went to college with, no one I work with, no neighbors, no one in my family (with one exception) knows how my wife and I run our relationship.

*TES: Oblivion* - I am at the final Oblivion Gate and can't seem to force myself to close the gate and finish the main story. I think I could finish it if it weren't so daunting that I also have all the DLC still yet to do. I wish I hadn't bought the goty edition.

*Bioshock* - I am really bad at this game, just awful. I want to see the rest of it, but I just suck at it so badly. I want to participate in the Bioshock fun, but honestly I may have to just watch a Let's Play of it since I moved away from all my friends who I could invite over and watch them play. Sadly, I might be the worst FPS player ever.

Every time I load up a game that's not Oblivion or Bioshock I feel guilty. I'm currently playing Alan Wake and Skyrim (why the hell am i playing skyrim if i didn't finish oblivion?!!) and really want to start Sleeping Dogs that I downloaded yesterday, but I impose a two game per platform limit on my self to keep me focused (I allow 2 games on xbox and 2 games on pc simultaneously).

**Ingredients:**

Chicken

1 chicken boullion cube

boiling water

lemon juice

butter/oil

flour

garlic powder

paprika

1 egg

If you want to get REALLY fancy: Capers

**Directions:**

-Clean and cut chicken.

-Heat pan and melt butter/warm up oil. Use about 2 tbspns, enough to keep the pan greased with a bit extra.

-Mix egg and ~1tbspn of lemon juice in a bowl

-Mix ~1/2 cup of flour, garlic powder, paprika in second bowl.

-Dip chicken in egg mix, flour mix. Put in the pan.

-Brown both sides.

-Meanwhile, boil the water with a boullion cube and some lemon juice. 

-When the chicken is browned, add the water mix. Let it simmer for about 20 minutes (flip halfway). If you're being fancy, now is the time to add capers.

-Serve. Accept praise for its deliciousness. 

I like to serve this over pasta (cooked with some lemon juice) and double the water mix so there is enough to mix as a sauce.

* what the infraction is - if it's an official warning, it will state ""Official Warning""
* reference and link to the specific rule 
* what is required from the individual (do they need to edit? do they need to re-post under another tag?), and what actions the mod team is taking (i.e., post removed, official warning, temp ban, perm ban)
* modmail link if there are questions or disagreement, as all decisions are team decisions and we prefer to address concerns as a team rather than individually

Gebbeth,todayilearned,1388674097.0,"I'm not sure I get what you're saying, but what I understand from your words is that you're thinking that the expansion can be faster than speed of light if all sections blew away from its center of mass at the speed of light. So basically what you're doing is: c + c = 2c.

However, we know from special relativity that one object cannot travel faster than the speed of light relative to another object. So we would have to account for that. How do we do that? We use the factor [gamma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity#Reference_frames.2C_coordinates_and_the_Lorentz_transformation).

Thus, we see that if two objects (for the sake of simplicity, let's say they have equal mass m and travel exactly the opposite direction) travel at 99% the speed of light from their center of mass. They will travel at 99.9950% the speed of light relative to each other.

We also see that for small velocities, gamma is negligible and therefore your approximation is correct. However if, we're talking about velocities greater than, let's say, 0.1% the speed of light, relativistic effects become important and the approximation is no longer correct."

selsewon,AskMen,1388674111.0,"I believe there are 3 types of people when it comes to relationships.  

1) The lucky.  There are those that find themselves in great, long-lasting relationships from a very young (relatively speaking) age.  This is ultra-rare, even as many relationships on the surface start off blissful but can end in heartbreak.  Heartbreak is more common than love.

2) The settlers.  These are the folks that ""settle"" to make do with what they have found.  Sparks may have not have flown as much as they would have liked, lightning may not have struck them, but they are... content with what they have and may manage to stick it out until the end.  They have settled for what they have, but may silently wonder (for a while or forever) if they could have had something better.  This group of people terrifies the last group, and keeps them there...

3) The dreamers.  I place myself in this group.  I am a 36 y/o m and have been through engagements, heartbreak and heartbreak again, ups, downs, casual, serious - you name it. Everything shy of marriage and divorce basically.  Dreamers believe in something great awaiting them.  Fate, to some I suppose.  And honestly, I don't necessarily preach that ""this"" is the best way to go about it.  Maybe that group of Settlers are the wise once they do not find themselves fortunate enough to be in the group of the Lucky.  I think Settlers can find happiness because they learn to work together over time - and I think some Dreamers unfortunately spend a lot of time alone.  This can drive us mad - but it is WHO WE ARE.

It's okay to want everything in your mate.  Maybe a tad unrealistic, but it is okay to have high expecations.  You are doing what drives you and you feel as if great love is a priority - do not change your desire.

What I would suggest is to shift your own paradigm.  Do not force it, it can lead to frustrations.  Rather, have FAITH that the universe will eventually put you, and your future mate together.  I am an atheist, so I do not preach faith in the Religious sense. Rather, faith that with effort investment of self, you will be placing yourself in the best possible position to find your counterpart.  


TL; DR - It's okay to want the world, just get yourself in the best place possible to attract the best possible mate."

KayBee236,relationships,1388674126.0,"You seem like a smart woman that knows what you should be doing objectively, yet subjectively you feel stuck. Remember that, right now, you are part of the statistic of women in abusive relationships. Bottom line. Literally no one deserves what you're going through, not even the shittiest selfish person you know, because what you're experiencing is abuse. It is not some bad relationship and you're unhappy- it's a psychological issue that exists solely to break people down. You cannot win this because there is no winning.

I want to beg you to get out, but I don't know if it will do any good. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship and those that cared about me constantly told me to leave. My excuses were either ""you don't know him the way I do"" or ""I put so much time into this"" but the truth is, they were right, just as you would be right if it were your sister in your situation.

Don't even think of it as you finding a man that will treat you better, think of it as what it is: abuse. He is abusing you. It is not your job to protect him nor help him. He is a grown adult with perfectly capable mental capacity that is choosing to treat you a certain way. He needs therapy and you are not a therapist. 

Do what you already know you must do. Rely on those that care for you to help you through this, because it will not be easy, but do it. Those people care for you for a reason and will be willing to pick up the pieces, because that's one of the purposes of friends and family. When you love someone, helping them is not a burden.

It will not get better if you stay with him. IT WILL NOT GET BETTER. Trust me- I went back to my ex 4 times. No matter what he tells you, it will always revert back to the same behavior. Remember that, if you go back, you are not helping him just as you are not helping yourself.

Ok, now I am begging. Please get out. I, a complete stranger on the internet, wishes more for you and sends you love. Look at all the people on this thread that care for you and want to help.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,AskMen,1388674336.0,"&gt; it's not just about you.

This is the most important thing to take away from this excellent post, IMO. 

It's about *them*. This includes being available to them (going out and meeting women), being attractive to them (working out, being important, being confident), and working toward getting to know them (starting a conversation and then not blowing it). 

If a person focuses on themselves all the time, they'll end up a total basket-case, but this is rarely a problem. More often than not people aren't focusing on themselves enough...they blame others for not wanting what little they have to offer, so they end up in a never-ending cycle of bitter and lonely. 

Self improvement can be whatever you want it to be, but self improvement *from a relationship standpoint* is all about having things to offer someone else, whether it be in a home purchase, a job interview, or in dating. Part of that is understanding that no one will know you have anything to offer until you advertise it, and often people will buy-in to the person with the best offer on the table which explains loser dudes with awesome girlfriends.

Improving yourself for yourself, improving yourself for others, improving your situation, improving your communication skills, and improving your ability to advertise yourself to others are all different goals here. When they come together, you are likely to be a very successful, happy person."

My friends however were not like this, but the weird thing is that they weren't always like that.  We used to know how to have fun and do crazy things but once we left for college... people change.  After that they always needed to drink.  If we did something, drinking had to be involved.  'lets hang out' quickly turned into 'whos bringing the beer'.  'lets go out and do something' was now 'lets go to a bar'.  If we ever tried to do something else then drink it would have to be 'lets pregame' or 'what bar are we going to after?'.  There was never a time when it seemed that they didnt do anything that wasnt drinking.  They're growing out of it now, thankfully, but to be honest... its why I never wanted to hang out with them for a long time. "

While I do well with smaller groups, large groups are intimidating and I prefer to just hang out and listen most of the time. There's really nothing wrong with that, I don't like competing over air time. Like I said, own it and be comfortable. 

Also, you're probably attracted to chatty girls because you want someone to compliment your personality. And as for the ""boring"" thing, no one is really boring it just takes different stimuli to get them going. If you want to have some life experiences, find an adventurous girl who will take you out and give you these experiences.

Skellum,paradoxplaza,1388674957.0,"I think the trick here is that it's not Historically based, simply gameplay mechanics that are the issue. The anti-blobbing mechanics are cumbersome and extremely heavy handed and in general favor luck far more than they favor skill.

Austria is geared towards ""winning"" the game currently and so usually gains much more power than other nations simply because it's diplo abilities are very strong. Brandenburg which is arguably the strongest nation takes a huge amount of time to get properly rolling due to how manpower works and even when it could conquer everyone around it it cannot due to AE, Coalitions, and peace treaty mechanics. 

Warfare is completely handicapped in EU4. The mechanics of creating mega vassals and integrating them are broken. It needs to be completely reworked. I would argue Coalitions should be removed, they dont prevent conquest by forming against super powers, they prevent only players from conquering because the AI avoids AE as hard as it can. Meaning the only coalition the AI will join is anti-player coalitions. 

The world should be a shifting mishmash of alliances up until post WW1 when hidden alliances are really removed. 

Add into this a broken mission system with very poor risk vs reward, events that are almost all punishing and poor short term rewards and it removes a lot of fun with the game. Imo, the hardest thing to do in EU4 is to play from 1455 to 1821."

But i also saw on another board someone saying that it wasn't just AVB who had an issue with BAE in the club...sounded like there were a few people who had an issue with his attitude and work ethic and as a result leaving him at QPR was a very real possibility.

irondal2,AdviceAnimals,1388676595.0,"As a nonuser, other people's drug use has mosdef affected me, from an early age. First, drugs are illegal. Doing that kind of illegal act, especially through and after the eighties, can be construed as an antisocial tendency. There's the law, and so you have a person who says they don't care. When your parental figure disregards authority, and thinks they're cool, it DOES NOT end there. Especially through and after the eighties, and even now in some places, there's a paranoia associated with being outed that all these users have when they hold possession of an illegal substance. Drug takers, drivers, dealers, and their families go through elaborate measures to avoid law enforcement detection of their illegal activity, and other people don't do anything special to stay under the radar because they are not breaking the law. The imprint of that kind of parenting can become a permanent feature in growing children (e.g., I have always been sneaky as all get out, and I always ""look guilty"" unlike my friends who have the looks of honesty upon their faces and are generally forthcoming) and these children will be adults who have to consciously modify their behavior, emotions and learn ways to separate themselves from the people and survival skills from their upbringing. Lastly, some drugs are designed to make the user experience a stupor. With ""dope"" the desired effect is even in the name! As someone who has experience in military intelligence, a few college degrees, and is about to finish a doctorate-level program, it's hardly beneficial to go home (wherever that non-existent, fairy tale place is) to look for advice, life pro tips, professional encouragement or any kind of intellectual stimulation.

sir_sri,AskMen,1388676670.0,"My GF is 34 and can't drive, and it's royal PITA.  It means I'm *always* the one doing driving to peoples houses  for christmas/new years/events etc.  And it means basic routine things, going to work, shopping for groceries, shopping for anything necessarily involves me and wastes my time.  

But story time.

My mother worked with this gentleman named Lloyd from when she was 19 to 53.  Lloyd is a nice guy, always was, a big baseball fan.   Lloyd is also married, has been for... uh... at least 35 years if not longer.  His wife didn't drive.  

When Lloyd got to about 63 years old he started to get forgetful.  He forgot how much beer he'd had to drink (or where he'd put the beer, which, was, a least, a self limiting problem).  Then he forgot how to get places.  He's in a home now, and doesn't remember me, my mother or his wife or son.

Suddenly his wife had a  big problem.  She was about 60, never worked, never drove... and needed to learn, fast.  She needed to be able to drive on highways and in big cities to get  to and from  her husband.  It was a nightmare (and a fairly expensive collection  of damage  to various cars because she didn't have any experience to rely on when trying to drive around).  She has to drive now, and in many ways it made her own  life so  much better.  She gets to do whatever everyday and not waste time on  public transit and  that nonsense.  Driving  is part of her independence - which was forced upon her.  

So the TL;DR is that yes it's annoying, depending on where you live it pushes the point of deal  breaker.    But being able to drive is more about your own independence and efficient use of time than  it is about me.  It really does depend where you live though.  "

Zagaroth,ffxiv,1388676927.0,"A lot of the big AOEs in the hard content don't even seem to damage my pets, and I leave the fairy on follow during primals because of the few that do. I don't micromanage the fairy other than occasional place (Like, Garuda HM I'll place the fair for the first part until she using the max-power wind attack, at which time i use heel because the tornadoes will damage her and there is lots of movement after that.)

For Extreme Mode Gardua, I have to use the obey command on a SMN pet to keep the AoE from hitting the spiny plume, so I have to manually trigger attacks. So I have to manually activate contagion etc, and occasionally use heel to move my garuda-egi to move her out of tornadoes

Basically learn when you can leave the pet alone, when to place it, and when to drag it around with you. It's not terribly intensive. Most bosses, like ultima HM, you can just ignore EGi's positioning, or use a simple place command on a fairy (though not sure about fairies for Ultima HM)."

Smokeahontas,MakeupAddiction,1388677165.0,"Primer: 2013 is the year I finally stepped away from UD Primer Potion. I had used it for years and it always resulted in a creased, oily mess and I just assumed one primer was the same as any primer. WRONG. Nars pro prime change my eyeshadow life. 

Foundation: Bare Minerals remains my HG, though I haven't really branched out since it works so well for me, and has for almost 10 years. 

Powder: Hourglass Ambient Lighting powder in Dim Light. Holy shit this stuff is incredible. Definitely one of my favorite purchases. I use it as finishing powder and it makes me look flawless. 

Blush: I stuck with my tried and true, Nars Orgasm, this year. In 2014 I'm looking to branch out with my blush. I have my eye on Tarte. 

Eyeshadow palette: Naked3. I know it has a kit of hype and many folks on here don't like it too much, but for me, Naked3 is a dream product. Since I got it I've been using it every single day. The matte shades are buttery, lovely colors and the shades with glitter have decent staying power. As a cool toned olive skinned lady with green eyes, a palette of pinks/plums like this is pretty much a dream come true. One of my favorite purchases. 

Eyeliner: ELF cream liner. I was quite surprised by this product! It goes on quite nicely and the formula dries quite matte. I don't think it will hold up in the humidity of summer, but it's great for winter! 

Mascara: Clump crusher without a doubt. I've tried so many mascaras, high end included, and nothing else makes my lashes look so good. 

Highlighter: Toss up between Nars Albatross and Benefit High Beam. Love them both. 

Lipstick: UD Revolution lipsticks, specifically in Shame. Good gods I love everything about it: the formula, the color, the staying power. 

Other favorites; Guerlain lipstick primer stuff, NYX wonder pencil. 

I'm also going to include my least favorite product I tried in 2013: Benefit They're Real! It was clump city on me, and I find it extremely unlikely that anyone would assume the clumping, spidery mess on my lashes was ""Real."" "

This is a huge problem in certain ultra-orthodox Jewish communities, like Mea Shearim in Jerusalem. The average family size is 9 kids, with some families having as many as 15. This isn't encouraged by community religious leadership, it's basically demanded. It has driven many families into abject poverty. It's not affecting general population levels, but because it is a community with unbelievably rigid boundaries, it is a micro-example of what happens when per-family birthrate is high.

Skellum,politics,1388678090.0,"The major issue with this is the abuse of H1B1 visas. We have very skilled labor in the US. US companies know they can get a subsidized slave from India and instead of putting out a requirement for a Java guy of ""Needs 2-3 years Java experience"" they put out requirements for ""Requires 10 years java, 20 years in a program made last year, 10 years veterinary experience, and 5 years culinary schooling."" Mr. Patel has written up false qualifications for all this, is sold to the company and works for nothing which is comped by the H1B1 visa eliminating the US citizens chances at the job.

So H1B1s must be eliminated or reformed into a US jobs program. Next we have the issue of Offshoreing. Offshore is useless. IBM service solutions, Cognizent, Infosys are all fuck awful to work with. Offshore will sell you 500 people at 20$ an hour. In reality you've purchased 2 guys who are using HTML and Java chunklets their company provides them and probably wont get near 10% done what you need them add in that your onshore resources cannot get decent communication with them due to the time difference and you see why most US IT developers are massively overworked.

AsherMaximum,castiron,1388678420.0,"It's kinda true that pans don't stay seasoned.

Yes, a pan can lose seasoning as it is used, but it can also gain seasoning as it is used. It all depends on what is cooked in it.  
If you fry up some veggies with barely any oil, or sear a steak without adding any fat, that would be something that would make the pan start to lose it's seasoning.
However, if you cook bacon, or sear a steak with a little oil or butter, or fry chicken, or cook anything with a decent amount of fat in it, it will help build the seasoning. 

Now, cleaning is another area seasoning can be lost, but as long as you aren't too rough, the seasoning should build up as you use the pan.  
So, unless you do a lot of very low fat cooking, or you wash your pan with soap too much, or let it soak before cleaning it, you shouldn't have to reseason a pan."

""Almost"" like?

Edit: yes, I suppose it *is* ""almost"", because the rest of the time is dedicated to this:

&gt; denigrating Palestinians in every single possible instance

[He has an entire semi-personal subreddit dedicated to that exact purpose](http://www.reddit.com/r/PalsbaraInAction/), which he mods and where he (almost exclusively) paints any pro-Palestinian story as literally propaganda and lies by anti-Semites. Disagreement with him is not allowed, as he decided to disable downvotes.

In the Israel-Palestinian conflict, emotions (and resulting biases) are frequently unavoidable, and thus understandable in moderate doses. That subreddit, however, is aggressively hateful. Check [this submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/PalsbaraInAction/comments/1tt1qs/weekly_demonstration_look_at_all_the_children/) out by his fellow mod, the #2 contributor. It links to an ordinary Facebook image of Palestinian children standing around in holiday outfits, some holding Christmas trees. The tagline says: ""Weekly Demonstration: Look at all the children Palestinians bring"" Such a tag might had been innocent if used in a different context, not at a subreddit that describes itself as: ""This subreddit exposes the douchebaggy, radical nature and ridiculous pseudo-logic that is demonstrated by Palestinian supporters (Palsbarists), anti-Zionists and Israel haters on a daily basis. Lies, meltdowns, humiliations, extremist remarks and embarrassing behavior all encouraged and welcomed."" So a Facebook picture of children with holiday regalia is an example of ""douchebaggy, radical nature and ridiculous pseudo-logic that is demonstrated by Palestinian supporters""? What the hell?"

-evasian,MouseReview,1388678755.0,"I just received my Deathadder Black Edition yesterday and I just tried it out. Although I understand the Black Edition and the 2013 vary in terms of the coating on the mouse, I'm just going off with my experience of using it for an hour or so.

Originally I use a Logitech G400. I love it. The only reason I like my Deathadder Black Edition more is because of the cable, scroll wheel, and the buttons on the side. 

Both sensors on both mouses felt fine. Didn't see much of a difference. 

The biggest difference I felt was in how I held the mouse. I'd like to say I'm between a claw and palm grip. With a Logitech G400 I can get away having a claw/palm grip and I feel pretty darn comfortable. Whereas when I tried gripping the Deathadder Black Edition it honestly felt like I was being forced to use a palm grip. The Deathadder Black Edition also can serve a better purpose for anyone who feels a Logitech G400 is too small for their hands.

I love both mouses, and I've also tried a mouse meant only for claw grips. If I honestly wanted to I could force the transition so I can accustom myself to the Deathadder Black Edition, but at the moment I'm really liking my Logitech G400 and probably will stick with it until it wears out.

If price honestly means a big thing to you I think the G400s would be more than fine for you since you've had experience with the G400. From what I've read the only thing they've added to the G400s is the rubberized coat on the mouse and they've added something to where the cable connects to the mouse to make it more sturdy. If you take a look at the pictures you'll know what I mean.

I hope this helps! :)."

Soap will remove all the oil from the pan. It will not remove the burnt on oil (which is the seasoning layer), unless you really scrub hard.  
The reason that can be bad is that when you clean it out without soap, a layer of oil is usually left behind. That layer of oil protects the seasoning, and when you next heat up the pan to use it, it turns into more seasoning.  

So, no reason not to use soap, just probably a good idea to not use it every time.  
If you can get the pan clean without it, keep on doing that. But, if you have something you need soap to get out, go ahead and use it, it won't hurt your pan.
  
I use soap when I need to; for a cheesy dish that left a lot behind, for a pan that I forgot to clean and has had food and grease sitting in it overnight, or for something that I don't want to effect the next meal, like frying fish. I'd say I probably use soap about 30% of the time.

*edit: if it were true that soap removed any and all seasoning when you used it, that's how people would strip their pans for reseasoning, instead of the complicated electrolysis, lye bath, oven cleaner, and other methods people use.  
Also, if the seasoning were all removed by washing with soap, you could tell, because the pan would be gun metal grey after you washed it, not black/dark grey. "

Um, because you don't actually have to grind if you don't want to? You can if you want but it's certainly not mandatory. It may be 2014 but the word ""no"" is still full of its same old power. 

You guys should take some dance classes together and learn how to actually dance! Then instead of being one of a hundred couples mindlessly rubbing privates on the dance floor you'll be able to move with some style and grace, and probably have even more fun.

If you have a decent relationship with your aunt I would not recommend doing the second one because it would only make her feel bad. Or three, you can simply stop posting pictures of your child to Facebook. You could try emailing specific people the pictures if there are certain people you don't normally see in your daily life like relatives that live far away.

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1388680072.0,"&gt; How would you go about building a world which is halfway between a low-magic/low-fantasy and a high-magic/high-fantasy?

Materialist magic, of course. There are places on Earth where the magnetic field is much stronger than others, you could have a mystic field from which magic is drawn, meaning high-magic societies rise up in these zones. Or you could make the magic strictly material, make it some object which must be collected/mined/cultivated. In this version, they could also carry magic with them to other places, meaning those societies don't all end up isolationist.

&gt;What are the worldbuilding considerations for making contributors lives easier?

You're talking about a bunch of radically different societies. Things like that only evolve in relative isolation. So you need to make it difficult/impossible to trade over certain boundaries, meaning styles change only slowly. Technology will move across these barriers, but some expertise will be required to make them work, so you can slow them down by interspersing the high-tech civs with some low-tech ones.

Inevitably, your problem will be that people tend to shirk rules, and technologies and culture tend to spread. You can't really have have radically different modes of life nearby one another without North Korea-style border policy."

I have no source to back this up, but maybe this has something to do with France being a very Roman Catholic country?  So on Lenten Fridays, when you're not supposed to eat meat, people generally eat fish.  So under some peoples' reasoning, fish =/= meat?

This actually works out okay for me; I'm a pescatarian so I avoid meat but eat fish.  Headed to France today!"

There's a reason why he isn't a starter. Hell, I only saw the games. There's training camp and practices, during which players' skills are rated and judged against their competitors. I can't think of a single starting quarterback in the NFL who is worse than Tebow.

The nasty thing about the NFL is that every single person there is the best at what they do. They were all star players in college, and the NFL concentrates that talent still further.

If you're arguing that life begins at one specific point, then you're making a fairly arbitrary argument, which means that this whole debate comes down to different sides arguing their own arbitrary points.

cudtastic,miamidolphins,1388681115.0,"Ireland did let Jake Long walk. Along with Sean Smith. And traded Vontae Davis. And let McDaniels walk. All of these guys are quality football players, they just either wanted too much, or the coaches wanted different players scheme wise, or the coaches didn't like their personality. Why blame that on Ireland?

Ireland moved on from Vontae and Sean Smith because Coyle was moving towards a zone scheme, which they didn't fit. Both of them are doing really well for their new teams where they play man primarily. And Grimes has been amazing in replacement (with Nolan Carroll having a decent year, a former 5th round pick, in place of Patterson, AKA we have depth at CB).

Jake was asking too much given his history of injury. He had a decent year with the Rams, but yeah he ended the year on IR again. He got McKinnie for what a 6th round pick. And who could have foreseen the issues with Martin/Incognito?

McDaniels we let go because he wanted too much given the depth we already have at DT. Sucks, but we had to allocate resources elsewhere. Starks + Soliai + Odrick is a sick combination. And now McDaniels is a big contributor on an awesome defense in Seattle.

Ireland hasn't had enough time with the new coaching staff to find players that fit the scheme they want to run. We were transitioning from a power offense to a finesse offense with Philbin, and from a traditional defense to a more attacking one (LB swap) with Coyle. 

Honestly the coaches have tried to make this full on swap without utilizing the talent of the players who ARE on the roster."

And, in my opinion, it's certainly appropriate for Genesis. But something like an epistle or one of the gospels is a little more complicated if one is taking the further step of applying meaning gathered from a specific text to our current world.

I think the important thing is staying true to what the original author meant. Otherwise I can read Moby Dick, decide it has some special meaning to me, and decide the world is ending in 6 months. It's just hard to set a limit on what something means if you're not going to attempt to fully understand the original meaning/context/purpose/history/culture behind a historic document or sacred text of any religion.

From a standpoint of wanting to reach as many people as possible as efficiently as possible, the workers should be paid and I think even the people receiving care should pay a small amount. It would ensure that the people doing the work were the best available workers (since they would compete for jobs) and would ensure that the people who received care truly needed it. It would also provide an incentive to reach as many people as they can.

Now obviously we're talking about extremely poor communities. I think the US (and the UN, WHO, etc.) should basically give these people money so that they can pay for healthcare, rather than pay to have the healthcare provided for free. It sounds like we're just trading dollars for dollars, but I think in reality it would improve the system."

And there had been [tensions over worshiping there for a while](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs#Israeli_authority).  I'm also not sure what the division was pre-1994.  Things seem to imply that there was some sort of Jewish part of it, things were just codified in 1996.

It's also the least of the three major gravesites in terms of tensions.  The tombs of Rachel and Joseph are both major flashpoints.  The former is under Israeli Authority, and the latter under Palestinian.  The issue with the first is essentially that it's right in Bethlehem.  It's essentially in a giant fortress after it was besieged during the Second Intifada.  Joseph's tomb is under PA control with limited Jewish access, but some Israeli groups try to get in unauthorized.  And the PA has failed to protect the site from being desecrated by Palestinians.

Anyway, the point is that religious sites are often a flashpoint for conflict, and have been since the 1920s.  Splitting access to the site is hardly unprecedented, and was partially in place beforehand it seems."

Mongoosen42,AskReddit,1388682692.0,"&gt;where did I say that I got my information from some random google search?!?

Well, that's the only thing you've had to cite so far, including in nonsense rant. Do you have something else to cite?

&gt;I know exactly what I am talking about. And it is based on hard facts and not something someone taught me.

What facts? Where?

&gt;Really?, wow, look at what you turn into when challenged. Nice command of debate and logic there. You sure you aren't a liberal? You argue like one.

I did not call you pathetic and ugly because you disagree with me, or because you have challenged me, and I am perfectly happy to carry on reasonable debate with differing minds. But you haven't really offered a reasonable debate. You have offered nothing but insults and immaturity, and the suggestion that I do a google search.

Which, by the way, I did do your damn google search after your last vitriolic spewing of idiotic cognotive dossonance, the same pointless google search that you link to in this one, and I actually read through a number of the links. I didn't discover any information that I didn't already know, nor did I see anything that supported any of the claims that you have made, such as the idea that farming **is** bad for the environment, or that rotating crops properly doesn't prevent soil depletion. So again, do you actually have a source for me other than google? Because without one you really do just sound, again, pathetic and ugly. (Not ugly in appearance by the way. You might be very handsome. Ugly in personality. It's a southern expression.)

&gt; Basing major life decisions on propaganda

Right. My university education is just propaganda. I see. So any information that runs counter to what you believe to be true is dismissed as propaganda. Ok. Gocha.

&gt;I write like someone who is correct and cares about being correct.

You are not correct, and you have not provided a single source that backs up any of your claims. I'd love to see a peer reviewed paper complete with charts demonstrating how the neurology of vegans is such that they don't like the taste of meat.

&gt; You write like a typical liberal

So anyone you disagree with is automatically a liberal. Doesn't matter what I think about taxes, or fiscal responsibility, or deficit spending, or any other issues by which we actually define conservatives and liberals. No, I'm obviously a liberal because you don't like me because I told you that you are wrong (and pathetic and ugly (in terms of personality)) or perhaps because you think all environmentalists are automatically liberal. It's not possible at all for someone to believe in free market solutions to problems, disagree with welfare, and *also* care about the environment. That makes *total* sense.

&gt; paper thin knowledge

I actually linked you to a freaking source. And a real source. A scholarly, peer reviewed scientific study. Did you read it? Somehow I guess not. What have you linked me to? A google search. But my knowledge is paper thin. I see. You are truly blind to the level of hypocrazy (pun intended) that you exhibit, aren't you?

&gt;retreat to the default personal attack mode when challenged.

I believe I have offered more than just personal attack. Yes, I have attacked you personally, because you have repeatedly, and continue to, show yourself to be an awful human being. But I have also offered you logic and sources to back up my claims, (well, I haven't offered sources to back up my assertion that you are a terrible person, that is just my own opinion) while you have offered me nothing.

&gt; it is pure propaganda

If my scholarly, peer reviewed, scientific study that was published by the United fucking Nations is propoganda, what kind of a source do you consider to be valid and trustworthy exactly? Oh wait, are you one of those people that think the UN is in on some sort of conspiracy to something something, agenda 21 and blah blah puppet government blah blah? That would be a level of stupid I don't even feel like engaging.

&gt;Yet you left it there.

Like many redditors, I am in the habit of not changing the substance of a post once I have made it. I didn't know, for example, that you hadn't already read it. So I made an edit at the end. I apologized for my childish swearing, and you can either get over it, or else you can have have an entire fit about it. That's up to you.

&gt;Nothing I say changes your level of wrongness. That is all you.

I went into Father Makoul's workshop as well.  By mistake actually, I was late and thought his room was John Tichsels.  But you're right, it was excellent.  

I myself have a spiritual father and regularly confess, and I felt that what he had to say applied even more to me.  It was almost uncanny, it was as if my inner concerns about confession manifested themselves as a young priest who then spoke to many of my deeper fears.  

I imagine that his background in counseling is a huge boon when it comes to helping people confess.  He is an amazing priest."

i think we can all agree this issue goes both ways.

for me, it's not about whether to provide 5 points direct quasi-private mass transit to Belle Meade, with limited stops between. It's a matter of Dean pushing for federal money and doing whatever it takes to make it happen, without concern for the impact it will have on the affected roads. In fact, every single time an issue is brought up, his office usually ignores it or provides superseding contradictory testimony from a team of planning professionals, all hand picked for their pliability.

Being as i am actually a transportation engineer, who is quite familiar with city engineering and planning, i have yet to see any material that leads me to believe this is anything other that gov't boondoggle to ""grow the city"" and absorb federal funds for a program meant to aid MUCH LARGER cities.

I would feel a lot better about it running along Charlotte Ave/Pike, the true East/West Corridor, that has plenty of space for whatever terminals or dedicated lanes, as well as a lot of room for expansion along it's length. But if they ran it there, the affulent peoples who are so far resistant to the allure of mass transit might not be drawn to it and it wouldn't be anymore different than the BRT running down Gallatin Pike from Rivergate. In fact, why don't we just save a butt-load of city money and just do that? If the need is truly present, as Dean&amp;Co suggest.."

The US is big enough to have vested interests virtually everywhere, and it has a habit  of trying to 'help'.

phaqueue,wow,1388683135.0,"I'm sure some people will disagree with me here... but whatever:

I played and raided hardcore (8 bosses down in original Naxx) from Vanilla through the end of TBC. Raided a little when Wrath started then took a break, came back right after ToC released and played through ICC (killed LK). Quit before Cata release and just came back about a month or so ago. 



**LEVELING**

I leveled 2 characters to max (60) in vanilla, the first was a rogue, the 2nd a priest. It was PAINFUL. Having a level 60 main did nothing to help you (other than maybe having some gold to buy ""twink"" type items, or knowing people who could help you through dungeons).

Leveling was (to me) so bad that it instilled in me a deep hatred for the leveling process. I also leveled a Shaman in TBC to raid (same reason I made the priest in Vanilla - more on this later)

I've now leveled 2 characters 80-90 since I came back, and I have a warlock around 40 (doing mainly dungeons on him so slower than if I were questing, also not RAF)

I'm finally enjoying leveling again, enough that I may even actually level a few more alts while I wait for Warlords... Between Heirlooms (RAF too but I haven't used that yet), being actually useful at lower levels and being able to run dungeons to level, the revamp of dungeons so that the quests are given in the dungeon instead of in some random place outside and all the other changes, I think the leveling experience is MUCH improved...

**GEARING/RAIDING**

I leveled a Rogue as my first toon back in Vanilla... anyone who raided back then knows how hard it was as a DPS, much less a rogue, to get into a serious raiding guild. (even though there were more people). If I wanted to see the content, I would need to get into an MC raiding guild that was perhaps progressing into BWL and either hope they were good enough to progress, or get gear then jump somewhere else, if I could find a spot on my server, without being able to xfer between servers (server xfer didn't come out until TBC). If the guilds on my server that were farther progressed already had their full compliments of rogues, you were SOL until a slot opened up.

OR you could do what I did and re-roll to a more needed class. I rolled a Dwarf Priest, the most wanted class in Vanilla alliance side. This was painful enough as well. In order to get geared enough to raid, I needed to find groups to do the 5 and 10 mans (not 10 mans like you think today, 10-mans like UBRS...) I needed to figure out which pieces were best (itemization back then wasn't streamlined like now, remember mp/5?). Then, I needed to find a group that could actually do the instance. There was no LFG system, you sat in the main city and spammed until you found a group and hoped they were good enough. Sometimes, you spammed for a 1/2 hour, finally got someone, then while everyone was running to the instance, they left and you had to go back to town to spam again...

Once I got my 5-man gear, it was on to Molten Core/BWL. In order to do BWL, you needed a cloak crafted with (I believe) scales from Onyxia. You also needed resist gear for both MC and BWL (fire resist YAY). If you didn't have enough you wouldn't survive long enough to matter. Once you finally got into MC, you had to hope you got your pieces - the tier pieces only dropped 2 or so per boss that dropped them (and it was kinda random, one boss might drop priest gloves, while another drops the warrior gloves, etc). Most guilds used DKP, meaning you got points for killing bosses and loot that dropped. This caused other problems. FOr instance - most guilds gave 0 DKP for disenchanted loot, this means that if you got the loot because no one else needed it, you went into negative DKP, however if you just let it be disenchanted, it was worth nothing to the raid anyways. The people who had been there longer might actually have positive DKP, and some of them would have a TON, so when the rarer items dropped, they bid a ton on them.

Finally, once you got through MC/BWL, you got to move on to AQ. Oh wait, AQ now uses a lot of poison, so you're going to need some poison resist gear... back to farming. Or your guild might be doing Naxx (or both as ours was). Naxx had places that needed frost resist gear. On top of that, you might need specific pieces for specific Naxx fights, for instance as a priest on Patchwerk, I needed to be able to spam a heal for 5 minutes straight, so I needed mana regen and pots...

About pots/consumables. You used potions, elixirs, etc. Mana and Health potions weren't restricted to one per combat, so you had to basically know when to use them and many times you used multiple per fight...

Also, since the raid was 40 man, a lot of times you would have 25 or so people doing the work while the rest slacked off (especially on trash, and especially in things like MC) The raids were LONG. Some of the trash was harder than bosses and there weren't 4 or 5 trash pulls. In MC, just to get to the first boss was roughly 10-15 trash pulls...

There was no marking system, anyone that raided MC in Vanilla remembers the Garr setup. If you've never been there, head to MC and look at Garr (or find a youtube video) then figure out how you would assign each of those little adds to a separate tank or warlock (for banish) with no way to mark them in-game. The solution, the raid leader would have to keep track of which was which and target one then say ""ok offtank 1, take my target"" then switch to the next 'off tank 2, take my target"" this when done first try took maybe 15-20 minutes... It was never done on the first try. Inevitably, some tank would go ""umm, I lost my target"" and the whole process would start over. If you weren't the raid leader, a tank or a warlock, this was a good time to go eat dinner or read a novel...

There was no teleport to the end of the instance or the bosses you've cleared already. So when you wiped on say... Ragnaros... you got to run all the way back through the instance. Try it sometime - clear AQ40 and run from beginning to C'Thun in one run - even mounted it's a good 5 minutes plus... now imagine waiting for 39 other people to do this, some of whom will of course get lost, or go AFK then be behind everyone else (and also get lost)

Oh, and one guild I raided MC/BWL with was from Taiwan, they didn't speak english, in the guild was a mix of people speaking english, taiwanese and (I believe) chinese. All of this was done in raid chat/raid warning, in 3 languages, we killed Rag and Nef in that guild...


If you wanted to tank? Roll a warrior. If you wanted to heal, roll a druid or a priest (paladins were buffbots) there were no shamans on alliance or paladins on horde. There wasn't much (if any) crossover between class abilities. Paladins and priests could resurrect people. Druids could do it in combat, but they had no out of combat rez that was separate. Warlocks had to spend time before a raid farming soulshards so they could use their abilities and summon people. Hunters had to feed their pets and had to carry ammuntion for their weapons (which they tended to go through VERY quickly). Holy Priests/Paladins/resto druids COULD NOT kill mobs at all in some cases, so if you wanted to quest or farm, I hope you have a DPS character or enough gold to constantly respec (you only had 1 spec back then, not 2 like now)

+heal was a separate stat from +spellpower, so your healing gear wasn't even useful if you wanted to respec to farm, you needed completely new gear...

Suffice it to say, if the game were still like that, I wouldn't be playing - I wouldn't have time to do any of the stuff I want to do, and I'd likely be bored out of my mind...

I could continue, but this has gotten to be quite long already and I think serves plenty to illustrate how I definitely think it's a better game, at least from my point of view...

No, I can do you one better.

It's important if you want to lose weight to have a caloric deficit. Of course as you do this you won't be bulking. Hit the treadmills, and bikes to get some cardio in. Walk and run, mix it up. Hit the weights but do low weight high rep and very little rest. You're going to shed the pounds pretty fast if you couple this with a relatively healthy diet. Honestly, I was eating Mcdonalds and Pizza some nights and still managed to drop weight every week because I put the work in at the gym.

When you want to bulk, more calories and higher weights will do that. You want to slim down a bit first, then put the muscle on.

He has stuff all over his house and it's clearly visable from his door.  He answered politely and talked with them.  He made it clear he was a Pagan.  told them he would love to have them come over and talk, only if they are willing to listed about his faith.  They arranged a date as he was heading out the door.

They came back and his sister answered the door, of course they asked to speak to Frank.  She then lost it on them burst into tears and starting yelling at them ""Why do you people keep doing this?!?  HE'S BEEN DEAD 5 YEARS!""

&gt;while I tried to explain to him that he's not really a true Muslim.

See, my issue with this is that it is widely accepted in the US that there is a spectrum of Christianity, and that being a ""true Christian"" doesn't really have to be more than having been raised Christian, celebrate some of the holidays, having a personal relaitonship with a Christian-style God, and hoping your kids will do the same. For some reason, though, people don't get that Muslims can do the same thing. I know some Muslims who identify as Muslim not because they're super religious, but because it's their religious background and they simply aren't agnostic. 

&gt;What is really the point of saying that you are either Christian of Muslim if your deeds are condemned by the God you believe in?

Not everyone believes that what is in the Q'ran, Bible, Torah, or said by the leaders of their religious community is literal, or should be taken literally, or even that it's still relevant. People I know who don't live totally devout religious lives don't think their actions are condemned by God because they don't interpret everything absolutely strictly. They believe their life is an ongoing dialogue with God. You don't have to get it, but at least respect that it's pretty common for religious people to make some compromises to live in modern society, and give them autonomy over what compromises they personally choose to make.

gingerkid1234,Judaism,1388683708.0,"&gt; imnsho the post-giyur standards are lax when compared to Israel. Whether they are truly lax is really beyond need of discussion since there is no solid ""truth"" to compare to.

As I said, they obligate people in more stuff.  And at a certain point when it comes to halakhah there *is* a solid truth.  Sources I've seen overwhelmingly say that motives that would be rejected lehatkhila are accepted bedi'eved.  Plus non-observance could indicate insufficient commitment, which isn't the same as a forbidden motive.

I'd argue that a convert who becomes less observant after-the-fact still being a Jew is more solid halakhah than electricity being prohibited on Shabbat.  The other way was an innovation in the 1950s (not sure about the date) to prevent a case of mamzerut, where exceptions are made that otherwise wouldn't be, especially going against the historical halakhic norm.

&gt; However, I stick to my point. If OP can't do the big stuff, surely there is no point to giyur.

A good car graphic works with the lines the car has and compliments them. This can be as simple as the angle logos are applied at, or as complicated as a line that follows a flowing body line.

If you are just starting out, look and see what has been done on the car you want to paint in the past. Often that can give you a good idea for what can work and what doesn't. 

If you are going for a *race* inspired graphic, pick a title sponsor and work from there. Any of the major Spec classes (Aussie V8's, DTM, BTCC, and NASCAR) are good places to look for how to handle showing off sponsors.

Offline wallets are just that, dogecoin accounts/addresses that are not connected to the internet.

Futurecat3001,leagueoflegends,1388685079.0,"A criticism of your point #2 - people with high justice scores are good at predicting what other tribunal voters are likely to do.  That's not the same thing as being fair-minded.  In fact, to get a high tribunal rating it is usually necessary to skip borderline cases, rather than risk a pardon vote.  The tribunal community tends to skew toward very extreme punish frequency, partly for this reason.

Without a clearer standard set by Riot (or, I guess, by the community - though I don't think the community has an effective tool to establish a standard for voting on one's conscience), the effect will be an extreme polarization that reflects only prediction of the tribunal voters' hive mind.

Point being - I think the average League player 1) doesn't participate in Tribunal, and 2) is OK with a little bit of rage in their games from time to time.  The collective wisdom of the tribunal herd is that *everything* deserves to be punished, even the slightest toe across the line.  This isn't what the tribunal community itself even thinks, on an individual level (at least I don't believe it is).  However it is what tribunal voters *think* the other people voting on tribunal cases want to see, so to get a high justice rating you have to vote this way and ""skip"" every case that seems like it might be a pardon.

TLDR: tribunal incentive structure is majorly fucked up, and produces very extreme results."

Interesting things I noted: In 23 years,  no wild card team (5th or 6th seed) ever made the Super Bowl and lost. 5th seed has  done it once, and 6th seed has done it twice, but wild card teams usually get eliminated in the Wild Card Round.

2nd seed is most likely to be eliminated in the Conference Playoff. 3rd and 4th seeds usually get eliminated in the Divisional Playoff, The 3rd seed has only been to the Super Bowl 2 times in all 23 years, and has a 1-1 Super Bowl record.

The reason I stopped at 1990 is that the Playoff structure changed: before then, there were only 5 seeds. I chose not to include this data as it would be mixing different data types.

The data was accrued from Wikipedia sites like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:1997-98_NFL_playoffs) and [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:1998-99_NFL_playoffs).

I actually already submitted this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1t4ggr/plot_of_seed_vs_when_eliminated_for_each_playoff/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1t553t/seed_vs_playoff_results_for_the_nfl_since_1990/), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/1tzpc0/seed_vs_playoff_result_for_nfl_since_1990/), and once I got some great constructive criticism [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1t4ggr/plot_of_seed_vs_when_eliminated_for_each_playoff/ce48td6) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/1tzpc0/seed_vs_playoff_result_for_nfl_since_1990/ced85ph), I came up with this new (and I think, better) way of displaying the data.

I'm 24. No one thought it odd when I decided at 18 ""I want to be a software engineer.""

I have friends that married at 22. (Hell, I have friends that married at 18, but let's skip past that.) No one really thought different about it, and marriage is suppose to be forever. I know people who actively chose to try (and succeeded) to have a baby. Everyone showered them with praise.

People choose to join the military at 18-24, a decision which costs young men and women their lives every year, and that's their right, and they're respected for it.

But I decide *not* to have kids, and everyone goes batshit insane over it. It's especially baffling because, out of everything I've mentioned, changing your decision to never have kids is the single easiest decision to change. If I wake up one morning and go, ""You know what, I really do want kids,"" That's it. That's all I had to do. Actually going out and having one can be a bit more difficult. Even choosing to have permanent sterilization procedures doesn't stop me from having a kid. It makes it more difficult, yeah, but not impossible. Even having my own biological child is still possible after that.

So why is it that *this* decision, this easily reversible decision, is so demonized by society, when all the other decisions with potentially life-long repercussions are perfectly acceptable to make at a young age."

(to me the most interesting thing they talked about using a femme vs. butch spectrum as opposed to a female vs. male distinction and talking about how they wanted to situate their heroine =&gt; reminded me a bit of the discussions we sometimes have here: 

&gt; We also wanted a strong female protagonist: someone who would not be chosen, but would do the choosing; someone who would not be rescued, but who would do the rescuing; someone who would express the contradictions and ambiguities of femininity and navigate those waters in an empowered and independent way. Which meant that in the end, Rose had to have the option to go solo, to put her career first if desired, or to opt for a lesbian relationship. 

)

I only played a PC demo/beta, it didn't strike me as overly flowery (well at least not in normal conversation, there are some journal entries that are supposed to sum how you feel about the various suitors and some of them could get long winded, like comparing the edgy/badboy suitor to bitter coffee; it's wasn't really that euphemism heavy more like teenage girl with a crush). 

That said, I speed clicked through a lot of the text and I didn't check back to the journal after the one ""sex scene"" (more like a sex moment) I got. 


=&gt; speaking of fifty shades, there was an interesting /r/games link a few days ago about hentai games like Katawa Shoujo and how it limits the creators a lot that they can't be sold on steam and in the appstore.

You're going to need to take time to learn new champs every couple months, or you will be at a big disadvantage compared to your potential.

That said, here are three currently strong champions in each role (not necessarily the strongest, but learning each of these would give you a solid foundation for this patch):

Top: Shyvana, Nasus, Dr. Mundo  
Mid: Orianna, Gragas, Ziggs  
Jungle: Elise, Olaf, Vi  
ADC: Lucian, Jinx, Sivir  
Support: Annie, Thresh, Taric  

My suggestion would be to pick at most two roles to really focus on and have a good stable of in-meta champs for, and then be at least competent with 1 top-tier champion in each of the other roles.  You can get by with being unable to play one role, but if you choose to do this, you can't ignore support as sometimes everyone has to play it."

Specifically, I'm referring to the war stories such as the *Gikeiki* and the *Heike Monogatari*.

No, that is exactly what it was intended to do.

Keep in mind that many of the Founders had come to America from countries that had state religions, and that the governments of those countries persecuted those whose religion was different from that espoused by the state.

Most of the individual US states had state religions as well, and continued to for many years after the First Amendment was written.

The letter from the Danbury Baptists to Jefferson that occasioned his famed ""wall of separation between Church and State"" reply was written precisely because of this.  In 1798, the US went to war with France, and Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts - which directly contravened the First Amendment's protection of free speech and freedom of the press.  The Danbury Baptists (who lived in Connecticut, the state religion of which was Congregationalism) were concerned that Congress might in the future pass laws that voided the Establishment Clause and create a state religion for the United States, as it had voided the free speech and freedom of the press protections with the Alien and Sedition Acts."

HabseligkeitDerLiebe,todayilearned,1388686220.0,"The purpose of the law is to make it **almost** impossible to ever fire your weapon.

I was trained according to basically the same law when I was a soldier. Unless there is imminent danger to anyone's life (the exceptions I mentioned) you have to follow the protocol.

*You see someone doing something suspicious, so you shout:*  
**""Halt!""** - ""Stop!"" and wait for reactions.  
*If that suspicios person continues the action you should think about if it's really worth to kill someone over this. Because threatening with the use of a firearm is the same as actually using it, by German law, so you're committed. If you think so you threaten with the use of your firearm:*  
**""Halt oder ich schieße!""** - ""Stop, or I'll shoot!""  
*If said person still continues with that action you fire a warning shot into the air (or if this isn't possible into anything that will stop the bullet within your line of sight).*  
*Most people usually decide to either surrender or to run in this situation. If that suspicious person tries to run, you are allowed to shoot them in the leg so you can catch up to them to arrest them. Most soldiers and police officers choose not to do so and state that they couldn't be sure to not hit vital organs afterwards.*

This all obviously assumes that there is no imminent threat of anyones life. If there is a threat the process usually is shortened to the order to stop whatever they are doing and if they continue anyway there will be direct fire. These situations rarely happen in Germany, though.

Even if you follow the protocol (and even if there's imminent threat to anyone's life) the prosecutor will start investigating in a case of manslaughter. The investigation usually is ended quickly when there is no evidence suggesting any misconduct.  
If there was misconduct you will be tried for manslaughter and misconduct in office.

And /u/kevlewiii makes mention of situations that allow to forego parts of the escalation ladder (emphasis by me):

&gt;They can **only kill an attacker who is a threat to the lives' of other individuals** and when there's absolutely no other possible way to stop him from doing so. (...)

ProtoKun7,Android,1388686841.0,"Back when I used TouchWiz 4 on my Galaxy S II, it looked nicer than standard Android 2.3 did, and I enjoyed the functionality it had that in comparison, like the toggles in the notification bar, but ever since the overhaul of the phone interface in 4.0, TouchWiz developed with it but ended up looking a whole lot worse.

The switches you see in Settings, for instance (which now change between a 0 and a 1, I believe, but it looks more like O and |) look ghastly compared to the native switches.

I haven't used TouchWiz for any great length of time for a long time now, but I don't like the green they've used, nor the gradients they still seem to make use of. The toggles in the notification bar have increased from the five there used to be, and now it's just too crowded. Crowded, design clashes and gaudy colours everywhere.

This is a classic trick used in cults to convince people they have a secret, special verification of the cult's claims.

I suppose the only rational response is to ask why the same ""listen to the burning bosom"" approach works to prove so many different, contradictory ideas from so many different cults?  The possibilities are:

1) Each of these ideas is true (impossible, since they contradict each other)  
2) Human beings possess the capacity to believe their own desire for confirmation is actually some external source of verification, when in reality it's nothing more than self-deception

Only one of those can be true, and hint: it's #2.

EDIT: Oh by the way, if you want some more backstory as to the translation issues, anachronisms and other factual issues with the book of mormon, I suggest you check out mormonthink.com, specifically this section: http://mormonthink.com/book-of-mormon-problems.htm

Perhaps the most damning evidence against the ""truth"" of the Book of Mormon is the fact that the passages copied from the Bible (the sermon on the mount as delivered to the residents of the americas, etc) contain numerous translation errors specific to the version of the King James Bible owned by the Smith family, errors not found in versions of the Bible printed before 1600.  It seems very difficult to explain why a book that purported to be translated from golden plates preserved since the first century AD would contain translation errors that did not exist in any versions of the Bible prior to the specific version of the KJV that Joseph Smith owned."

werewolfchow,AskHistorians,1388687394.0,"Speaking from a medieval Japanese perspective, the basic mode of warfare was for the *ashigaru* or foot soldiers, to stab each other with spears and maneuver while the *samurai* of the warrior class found each other on the battlefield. There would then be an introduction for each participant, where they would name themselves and give all their titles so that their opponent knew exactly who they were facing.

 

After the battle, social status among the *samurai* was affected by the number of heads of opposing *samurai* they brought back, and the quality of their kills. The more famous the opponent, the more status gained by his death.

 

Incidentally, this was one of the reasons why guns were unpopular with the upper warrior class, because it allowed an unskilled farmer *ashigaru* to kill a mighty general. This was what happened to the famed general Takeda Shingen according to some of the stories of his death (these stories were adapted to film in *Kagemusha*).

 

This style of fighting has since become the most popular style of combat in Japanese media depictions of the period, which makes it tempting to brush it off as merely a fantasy. However, early pseudohistorical and historical texts from Japan confirm that this was indeed the goal of *samurai* officers in combat. 



One of my favorite stories is from the Tale of the Heike, in which the elderly *samurai* Sanemori Saito dyed his grey hair black in order to seem younger so that another *samurai* would seek him out on the battlefield, because an old man would not seem to be an honorable kill. After his opponent kills him, and the enemy officers are examining the heads, they recognize him and notice his dyed hair, and they praise him for his courage."

Right. So then what's the non-religious argument for why this should matter?  Is there a universal consensus on when someone becomes a person? There is not.  The anti-choice stance is dependent on the notion that life begins at conception and that this is sacred, but not everyone believes that.  So seeing as we're in an unavoidable grey area it seems best to let those that are most personally affected by these decisions to have the freedom to make the choice that makes the most sense for them and reflects their personal beliefs."

cudtastic,miamidolphins,1388687723.0,"I have many issues with this post. First, looking at this with respect to ""Number of players still contributing to Miami"" -- why is that fair? We have had coaching changes and scheme changes. If the coaches come to you and say ""Sean Smith and Vontae Davis are great at man coverage, but we want to run zone coverage"" what do you expect him to do? His job is to find talent for the coaching staff to use. Look at SS and VD now -- they had really good years for their respective teams. It looks like Ireland found good players, but the coaching staff dictates what they want or need. Or what if the coaches tell you that they want players who aren't as outspoken? You can try to tell them too bad, but your job is to try to accommodate what the coaches desire.

Second, you make a blanket statement saying NE, GB, Pitt, Indy draft better than the Dolphins do. How about a basis for that claim? Indy just off the top of my head gave us a 2nd round pick for Vontae Davis. Clearly they decided they needed to upgrade at CB because they couldn't find any CB's in the draft. I have a feeling that if Ireland did something like that, trading a top pick for a player, you'd be saying he gave up a great draft pick because he couldn't find any CB's in the draft.

Third, why is going after Peyton Manning or talking to Alex Smith an issue? In what way was that embarrassing? I don't get that.

Fourth, the Dez Bryant thing was overblown and misconstrued as others have mentioned. Dez said his dad was a pimp, and his mom worked for his dad, so Ireland asked the logical question. He wasn't calling his mother a prostitute, he was asking for clarification because Dez essentially just said that.

And lastly, I am sure that Ireland had little to nothing to do with Harbaugh. That was mostly Ross. It was clearly in bad taste, but I blame that on Ross. And if we had landed Harbaugh people would have been happy. "

You're not talking about PC language, you're talking about prevarification and lying for personal gain.

""PC"" language is itself a giant fuck you to anyone who complains about the use of destructive language. People get up in arms about PC language for two reasons. First, some people understand that using different words does not change people's minds a much as you might think. You can't take the racist out of someone by shaming them into not saying the word ""nigger"". Second, the racist/sexist assholes out there hate being told what they really are, and resent people using PC language to clearly identify them.

The probelm is TRP wants to be able to say what they feel: Fuck bitches, get money. Sluts are good. Blah blah. The fact is, they have very little respect for women, even if some of their self-actualization in contrast to their low self-esteem is probably healthy advice for anyone. They don't want to be judged for this lack of respect, and thus reject anyone arguing against their use of reinforcing language."

And you can't blame Ireland for JMart going crazy, no one saw that coming at all.

Jamar Taylor and Will Davis didn't see much playing time due to a combination of injury and good depth in front of them. Grimes, Patterson, and Carroll all had pretty good seasons. Not being able to ""crack the rotation"" isn't a bad thing if the guys that are playing in front of them are playing well. You can't judge a draft after the first season.

Starks and Soliai were draft picks (though Soliai wasn't an Ireland draft pick). As was Odrick. One of them will probably leave, and the other will probably be a modest contract worth like $6 mill a year. That's not massive."

What's emasculate about showing restraint? I'm not saying he should have let Kulemin do whatever he wanted, just that seasoned fighters should know that a shove from someone who has never fought before isn't justification to clock them. Remember last year when McLaren and Georges fought, and McLaren pretty obviously held back? I gained a lot of respect for him that day, I liked that he took a second and thought hey, maybe this guy's just being a team player and doesn't deserve a broken nose.

ceffaroo,Parenting,1388688934.0,"We just returned from a two week trip to the UK from Denver with our 6mo. I was stressing about it a lot beforehand, I even made up little favors to give to other passengers with earplugs and candy in them! We used them on our first leg but I quickly came to realize we bought our tickets like everyone else and shouldn't have to apologize for our child. 

A few things that made our journey 10 times easier:

1. We did not take a stroller. We used our Baby Bjorn in the airport and borrowed a stroller from a friend at our destination. I know this isn't practical for everyone but we were lucky enough to be visiting family and friends who have baby stuff for us to borrow. But I was really glad not to be stood in line at the gate with one more thing to keep track of!

2. Feed baby on take off and landing, if you can. Not only does it relieve the pressure on their ears, it made our daughter sleepy enough to drift off for the duration of our flight. Also as a slightly nervous flyer myself it gave me something to focus on!

3. The airline crew on the transatlantic (8hr) flights were incredibly accommodating. On our outward leg we were offered an extra seat so we just laid baby between us and she slept almost the whole way. It was an overnight flight so the lights were off most of the time too. On the return journey we had bulkhead seats and we got a bassinet which she loved - while she was awake it was a makeshift play yard and then she slept for a solid 4 hours in it too. 

Overall, crews and gate staff are very understanding, although I did get an eye roll from a fellow (older, male) passenger who did not seem to appreciate being sat close to a baby. Thankfully for us there were several toddlers making WAY more noise so our little girl looked like an angel in comparison!

Adjusting to the time zone change was a little tricky - we also had a 7 hour time difference. She fully woke up at 2am the first two nights and it took us about 2 hours to get her back to sleep - we kept the lights down low, spoke quietly and kept her wrapped in her blankets. For the rest of the trip then her bedtime was later than usual - 11pm as opposed to 9.30pm. She slept great though so we just let it slide. There's only so much you can control! She has adjusted well on the return trip as well, although we have only been back two days.


Hope this helps and that your journey is easy!

-Go to a bar or club.
-Volunteer (Old folks homes, homeless shelter, hospital etc.)
-Talk to a friend or a group of friends to set up an event like a BBQ, or a small party and have your friends, invite their friends.
-Find group meet ups online (reddit has meet ups in a lot of different locations. Or you can start your own)

Don't just stay silent during interactions.

cluberti,sysadmin,1388689126.0,"I've commented on this in the past, and my experience has been unless you work for a company that is actually in the IT industry, you can expect to be treated like the rest of the cleaning staff when it comes to compensation - you might get CoLA or a real raise, but... you might not.  And if you find over the years that your compensation has fallen behind that of your colleagues across the area you live in, you will very likely need to find a new place to call ""work"" before you get that sort of pay.

I have been able to chat with some of the hiring and HR managers in places I've worked in the past, and a good many confirmed my suspicions that hiring someone in IT and keeping them for 3-5 years was the expected life cycle.  Perhaps this is a self-fulfilling cycle, but I started work in this industry in the early 1990s and apart from the few years attributable to the .com bubble, pay problems have *always* existed in this field."

The prices they quoted you aren't bad, especially dealer prices. Is the refurbished transmission simply a used trans. Or a rebuilt one? Or your rebuilt transmission. $3700 for a reman isnt bad. Ask what kind of warranty you get. It all depends on how long you want to keep the car."

I think the part CoH did better than WoW's Battle.net was you didn't need to know the email address or personal information of your global friend. You could just add them by one of their characters as well as by their global handle.

And they had visibility options to hide from other players' local lists, and another option to hide from even their global lists.

Since CoH was also published by NCSoft, maybe we can ask them nicely to borrow that code! I know GW2 has the global friends list (no local list), as well as the logging in invisible, but they don't have a friend request approval step like Battle.net and CoH."

=&gt; there was actually a similar [interview](http://www.dealspwn.com/seduce-me-interview-125959) with the woman who made the (guy focused) game [Seduce Me]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ_QZVci92A&amp;list=PL1bauNEiHIgxY3Z6LoeL--NrAc6Linv1i&amp;index=30) where she talked about the challenges if gamifying sex/seduction. 

&gt;""Early on I made the decision that I wanted the gameplay to reflect the process of flirting and seduction,"" Bellard explains. ""I didn’t want irrelevant gameplay with dirty pictures as a reward. This led to research trying to find gameplay that reflected the feel of human interactions.

&gt; ""Traditional card games were an eureka moment. They felt right. They felt like conversations. And they involved some thinking - I didn’t get bored. From this point on it was about finding the right card games for each situation and tweaking each game until it felt right.

&gt;""The very presence of books like Fifty Shades of Grey makes the idea of erotica more acceptable,"" she says. ""We need more erotic video games though. It’s hard for a genre to be made acceptable when it’s non-existent.

&gt;""Personally I think too much sex is much better than too much violence. To change the industry brave souls need to make controversial content, and other brave souls need to support the same content. In many ways this is what happened with extreme violence. People made games and films with extreme violence and supporters of free speech defended those works and demanded that they not be censored. Now those works are much more normal and cause far less controversy.""

A church that thrives on misinformation is going to have a tough time in the Age of the Internet.  For example, ask your bishop whether he's aware that J Smith had 30+ wives, including one as young as 14, or that some of his wives were already married to other men... dollars to doughnuts your bishop has no idea, because the LDS church actively tries to hide these facts from its members, even though the LDS church does not dispute these facts when confronted by the historical evidence.

leavenworth,reactiongifs,1388690343.0,"It's not disregarding the Bible, though, not in that person's eyes. It's re-interpreting it, based on where they believe God is leading them. 

&gt; If the bible is not gods word, then what is it? Nothing more than a fairytale like the works of Homer. (Same with the Q'ran)

A few of my Christian friends have explained it to me thusly: God shared the Bible with humanity through humans, but humans are inherently flawed and God is omniscient and it's impossible to fully understand God's thoughts. The people writing therefore were interpreting through the lens and scope of their time period. God gave them a moral compass and they are expected to use it and their free will to be navigate this world. 

I'm an atheist, so I don't really get it, but I don't have to because it's not my head. That's what they believe. They're Christians. 

&gt;No one would call themselves a musician if that person didn't sing/compose/play any instruments. I guess they could still say that they are a musician at heart, whatever that's supposed to mean. In the same way, calling one self Christian (or whatever religion) and not believing in the foundation which in this case is the bible, is deeply self-contradictory.

Musician isn't an abstract concept, though. I think it would be more apt to say that someone can't call themselves, say, a libertarian if they don't do X, or a socialist if they don't believe Y. But if you want to stick to the musician example, then what I'd say is maybe someone who plays an instrument but can't read music wouldn't be considered a ""proper"" or ""true"" musician by some, but clearly is still making music. 

&gt;These people should, rather then identifying themselves with any specific religion, just state that they believe in god, but not in any religion. I think the lines are getting way to blurry.

ballookey,exjw,1388690449.0,"&gt;what would you do if the UN suddenly did turn against religion and make a cry of ""peace and security""?

It would depend on a lot of different things. What does ""turning against religion"" mean? If they actively tried to scour religious groups off the planet, that would be alarming to me because while I'm not theistic, I do think people should have the right to believe if they see fit.

(edited to add: if that's what happened, we'd have a lot bigger problems than the JW's being right about an obscure interpretation of a peculiar biblical passage)

If it meant simply that the UN would (against all logic and reason) cease dealing with religious groups entirely, stop helping, assisting, accepting them as NGO's...then I wouldn't really have a problem with that. 

""Peace and security""? Well again, would they be declaring that because with the fading of religion there were less zealots stirring up trouble for everyone? With the fading of religious fervor, were various groups finding it easier to work with each other to find diplomatic solutions to their differences? Then great!

But the phrase ""peace and security"" is insignificant. It's been said by politicians many times. In decades past, the Society was practically worked into a lather over it, certain the End was coming any time because they could point to these utterances. 

And then nothing happened.

In fact, they've eased up beating the ""peace and security"" drum because of all the false positives wearing people's sense of urgency thin.

So. Just because someone says something will happen, doesn't mean they predicted it.

Things happen. Life goes on. I adapt.

And even if this were the tip of the iceberg and they were right about everything...all of it...I wouldn't join. All of this is predicated on the god of the bible being a righteous, just, and loving god. I've seen ZERO evidence of that. I will not join up with a god who murders babies, children, and even adults who are just trying to get on with life.

I won't throw my lot in with a god who punishes all of humanity for HIS FLAWED DESIGN, after ONE single test.

I won't show up with my hat in hand on the doorstep of the Society because their idea of paradise is my idea of a distopian future where no one has true freedom, everyone runs around like mindless smiling drones...a gigantic terrarium for god's amusement forever and ever, amen.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1388690477.0,"&gt;First of all, your calibration matches decides your ""average"" number, if you lose 40% of that matches you are fucked. Second, during the calibration matches it's possible to get more than the standard 27 points, so it also counts your KDA, team presence, farming and stuff. This is severally flawed, if you dont play a hero that get kills or assists you're gonna be 3000 MMR even if you played good

what

I played support the majority of my calibration matches and ended up at 4.2k. What do you have to say to that?

&gt;Third, after the stupid 10 matches, there is no point in playing because the number you have now is purely luck based and it will only count wind and losses. If you are at 3000 MMR to get at 4000 you'll need to win countless matches, and if you lose (even if you did good) you still lose points. So again whats the point of ranked if all avaliates is your win and loss ratio? it's not a personal ranking, it's basicaly an arbitrary number that shows how much you can win, regardless of your performance.

Your beginning MMR is based on your normal MMR. Calibration matches can have more of an effect than regular ranked matches, but it's probably not significant enough to push you up or down 1000 points unless you're crushing or getting crushed in your matches. I have only a 52% winrate and 4.2k. What is your excuse?

&gt; So again whats the point of ranked if all avaliates is your win and loss ratio? it's not a personal ranking, it's basicaly an arbitrary number that shows how much you can win, regardless of your performance.

This type of bike (flat track) is very light, so it doesn't take much for them to ""balance"" or stay upright on two wheels. The way the rider crashed, combined with the sticking throttle meant that when the bike popped back up toward vertical the spinning rear tire propelled the bike forward preventing the bike from falling back down.

Willravel,Paleo,1388690595.0,"One thing you should bear in mind is that Paleo can be a wildly varied diet. A lot of new Paleoers have a tendency to come back saying ""I'm bored with eggs"" or ""I'm getting tired of chicken"". I've got a few hundred different recipes that I regularly choose from which are all Paleo (and many are Whole30), which means I never feel like I'm on a diet. Nothing is monotonous, in fact what I eat now is far more varied than what I ate before Paleo. If you think of Paleo as being restrictive, you're more likely to break it. 

As for convenience, I strongly suggest thinking of food, in general, as something you always have to prepare. Unless you're eating some raw vegetables, most of the time what you eat will require preparation, and usually cooking. Paleo, in part, is about no longer delegating food preparation to others, especially to those looking to maximize profit at the cost of quality. Instead of going and buying a thing of Pringles, you bake a sweet potato, so instead of Pringles combining potato starch and flour and salt and ""flavors"" and preservatives, you take the responsibility of going from ingredient to stuff you'll eat. I generally spend about 15 minutes each on breakfast and lunch prep, and maybe 30-45 minutes on dinners, especially if I have company. That's normal. The thing where we get to eat a meal in like 3 minutes isn't. 

You can count calories, absolutely, though it's not necessarily necessary. Someone already mentioned MyFitnessPal, which is really convenient and reasonably reliable. I'd suggest against big caloric deficits while also transitioning from the Standard American Diet to Paleo, though, as that can make the transition a lot more rough than it needs to be. The initial transition period of about a week should be whatever your normal caloric intake is (or, actually, eat until you're full), then after you've gotten used to Paleo you can decide if you want to count calories. Just bear in mind that on Paleo, you're getting *better* calories. A lot of people think a calorie is just a calorie, and they're not wrong, but 100 calories of broccoli and 100 calories of a milk shake do quite different things in the body. 

Drink plenty of water, make sure you're getting plenty of fiber, explore the produce aisle and try things you've not tried before, and enjoy cooking because it can be a ton of fun. 

Best of luck on eating Paleo and meeting your goal for the year. We're all rooting for you. "

I remember hugging a woman in Italy (close friend of a close friend, so not exactly a random stranger but still a stranger) I forgot that italians don't hug because they see it as very intimate. The look of shock on her face reminded me immediately that I'd just fucked up. Thank god she laughed it off and seemed to understand.

DrPepperHelp,electronic_cigarette,1388690810.0,"Let's get one thing straight first. When you stack batteries like you are talking about there are a few rules to follow.

1. Before you stack a set of batteries they need to be of the same age, mAh capacity, and have very close to the same discharge cycles. To make things easier and far safer if you want to stak is to buy a set of batteries that are dedicated to stacking.

2. Label your now matched set of batteries. Label them something like 1-1 and 1-2. That way you know that they are both from the same set, and what battery is what in the set. Why do you need to know what battery is what? Because the lead battery will drain faster than the other. If you rotate the batteries after every charge and discharge cycle they will last much longer. So you will use them in like this (1-1)+(1-2). Then after you charge them, and put them back into your device they should be stacked (1-2)+(1-1). Now both batteries at the end of this cycle will be at the same level of use.

3. Now just because these batteries are pair for life does not you have to go out and find a charger that can charge them in one channel. What is preferable is a charge method Parallel Charging. All this mean us that each cell gets its own charge channel or is charger independently of the other.

4. Do not use one cell that is at 50% with another cell that is at 90%. Just don't do it. It is dumb and will just jack your precious batteries up."

djcat,resumes,1388691372.0,"This is awesome! I like how you made the transitions between links. The only thing I can recommend is revising your resume to be in the same tense.  There was a lot of shifts from working and worked etc. Word them so everything is active. 

Also, Revise your ""about me"" wording. In whole, you need to be confident. This sentience: ""sometimes I help them become better at it too."" Does not say confidence to me. The ""too"" in this sentence is unnecessary as well. 

Also, the about me section is a run on sentence. Try to avoid using ""I"" as much as you have. In my opinion, using a third person view when writing may be best. 

For instance: Abhishek Gite is a ISEB/ISTQB certified test consultant with many years of hands on experience. After completing his undergraduate in Computer Sciences, Gite received his Masters Degree in Security Technologies and Applications. (I would then go into a little more details about your skills, keeping it in 3rd person.)

I feel that this would be the best way to get your information across without sounding full of yourself and saying ""i"" to much. 

Hope this helps! And again, good job!

andadobeslabs,AskReddit,1388691418.0,"this is gonna be controversial, but the brony fandom isn't really all that crazy if you know anything about fandoms at all. as much as it is a fandom that is focused on an existing show, i'd compare it more to the furry fandom than i would to any other obsession.

NOW DON'T START WRITING HATEMAIL YET. okay. i think the pony fandom is similar to the furry fandom because it is mostly self perpetuated and focused on fan contributions. there are definitely bronies who don't even watch the show. and both fandoms have creeps who fap to cartoon animals, but both fandoms are not JUST creeps who fap to cartoon animals. 

the show itself is cute and inspiring but it's definitely not the show that is the draw for most people. it's the community. and bronies take their fan contributions seriously. a lot of pony OC's are just as well known and a part of the fanon as actual characters of the show. thanks to equestria daily, there are really high standards in the fanfiction that are just not there for any other fandom. 

i think the reason ponies appeal to people is because the world is well defined and has well defined rules. the characters themselves make sense and have a logical pattern to their development so it's easy to make original characters. it's a perfect breeding ground for good fan content.

the only thing that still baffles me is that ponies have gotten SO HUGE compared to any other fandom. that's the main reason i would compare it to the furry fandom. pretty much everyone knows what furries are (even if they by default assume that they're furry fetishists). but people think that about bronies too. most people assume that bronies are pony fetishists. 

it's definitely deeper than the show, is what i'm saying. or even the fact that they're ponies."

tippitytopps,NYGiants,1388691428.0,"Not OP, and I don't have numbers to back up the claim about 3-4 games worth of film (though I don't disagree with that), but I think the point stands. *In an ideal world - perfect QB reads, well designed plays to allow effective reads, etc..,* the offense should be able to identify advantages on every play. 

Looking at tape lets you identify plays you're likely to see the next week, or coaches and players' tendencies. But it doesn't give you insight into how to stop the plays. I'll use Peyton as an example. Think about his running of ""Levels,"" (or dig, or whatever you want to call it) - that play does not work because it's unknown territory to defensive coordinators. 

That play works because it puts Peyton in a position to make a fast (and usually correct) read on the defensive scheme and pass accordingly. It's not about ""figuring it out"" in terms of predicting plays - it's about figuring it out in terms of how to disrupt those plays you're likely to see. 

I certainly don't mean to take credit from coordinators on either side of the ball, though - and that's where I disagree with /u/_isthePlace. Play design counts for a hell of a lot, and it's what allows for good and fast decision making on both offense and defense. A well designed play - and one called in the right scenario - is what makes players look their best; it allows an opportunity to read the opposition. It's not just what allows Peyton to make the right call and deliver a clean throw to an open receiver, it's what allows a great MLB or Safety to make a Peyton Manning hesitate on his pass and force an incompletion, or sack, or worse. 

And to bring it full circle to the Giants, I don't like this year's Gilbride because he didn't allow Eli the opportunity to make these reads (as mentioned many times over regarding our third down playcalling - especially third and long), and because there's clearly a disconnect on the offensive side of the ball regarding reads - how many times have we had a WR and Eli make opposite reads off of a coverage? I don't hate Gilbride, but I think a lot of the Giants' offensive successes, and certainly some of the [more](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek5Zyzn3Avw) [memorable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XeNefwABw) [plays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XSgZzHSts0), are because of our playmakers, not from setting those playmakers up to succeed further.

What I mean to say, is that the play calls do matter a lot, but they only go so far as to let talent through. Knowing a call is not going to stop it, but it will allow you to play against it more effectively. "

I know it will be hard to get used to but all you are doing is making it so your body tried to replace all that lost ear wax and/or compacts it in the back of your ear canal and it can cause problems. Here is what I do. Every day in the shower I take a washcloth or my fingers and I clean out the outside of my ear. I remove all the wax that is leaving my ear canal. Then I clean out the first tiny bit of my ear canal so it will be clear for the rest of the day. This makes   it so I will have a clean feeling ear without making the problem worse or losing the beneficial qualities of ear wax. Think of ear wax as being the same thing as the snot in your nose.

BrutalJones,Games,1388691773.0,"It's crazy to think how much gaming would be different had the merger never occurred. Square had a ton of goodwill back then. They were making incredible RPGs with thought-provoking, groundbreaking stories. All of that changed, and Japanese gaming suffered as a result. It affected my gaming habits, too. I was a hardcore RPG fan in the '90s. They were basically all I played. Squares downturn led to me getting more into stealth games thanks to the Metal Gear and Splinter Cell series, but I started to shy away from gaming more and more until I discovered western RPGs made by BioWare and Bethesda. I'm nearly 30 now but I still game a couple of dozen hours per week even working full-time. Back in college, though, I hardly played.

Though they're nowhere near as popular as they once were, I feel like there's a really devoted minority of fans who still worship the company. Have you ever visited some of the JRPG subreddits on this site? Square Enix still has a rabid fanbase that irrationally continues to defend every move they make. It's crazy to me. I'm somebody who grew up with them and their games; I literally learned to read as I was playing through the first Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior games on the NES. Final Fantasy VI is my favorite game of all-time to this day.

I guess it's because the company has continued to put out mediocre games and fans like me have melted away leaving only the irrationally hardcore fans."

Jermaine Jones used to be the best defensive midfielder in the entire league. But that was 5 years ago. He still plays the same way as he did back then, but time passed him.

Solid passing, anticipation, on-pitch intelligence and tactical dicipline are now a must-have for a defensive midfielder, and thats exactly the areas jermaine lacks the most in. 
It has nothing to do with Keller, Stevens benched Jones already, so did Ragnick more then often. Magath even preffered Kluge over Jones. In fact Keller tried to incooperate Jones as a important pillar in the team again, but it has become very clear that you cant fit jones into a tight tactical structure.

Men have not done the same for teaching, nursing, etc. It doesn't matter whose fault it is that men/women aren't in those careers; all this quote is saying is that while women demanded entrance into ""masculine"" careers and got it, men have not done the same for ""feminine"" careers.

&gt; Why are we hearing this from a Professor of *Law*?

[Clifford Rosky](http://www.law.utah.edu/faculty/faculty-profile/?id=clifford-rosky) specializes in gender-equality and its relationship to the law, and has written textbooks and taught classes on it. He might well be uniquely suited to state which gender identity is more valued; the law does not treat men and women equally, and how it does so might well be seen as a value judgment.



&gt; &gt; But while attitudes may have shifted, Rosky said, ""nothing changes until men are willing to act.""
&gt; 
&gt; ಠ_ಠ

That's the same as above. Rosky is not saying its the ""fault"" of men; he's simply stating that if men want equality, they need to start demanding it, fair or not."

irondal2,AdviceAnimals,1388692254.0,"&gt;My initial post was an opinion.

That's great. I didn't ask you for citations to support your first post at all.

&gt;However, authoring that many papers (assuming your education is legit) should have made...you know what? Nevermind. 

Nah, go on. Most papers I've written for credit take more time than a reddit post takes, are easily understood (even by people like you), and don't include slang or innuendos that aren't acceptable in academia (unless of course, I've provided such things for emphasis, I've included footnotes and citations, and I've had my work reviewed by my advisor), but again, reddit isn't academia. I don't go to reddit.com and pay them $21K a semester for karma, and I don't expect scholarly articles when I read reddit comments (I'm above the banal attempts people like yourself make to disparage others' opinions based merely upon their word choice or format, but instead, I try to determine the deep meaning of posts). So, let's get to the deep meaning.

&gt;Are any of your degrees in child development?

Close enough, but no. Also, I have experience in working with troubled youth who have had similar early-life experiences (but I won't go into that because anecdotes mean nothing here on reddit). I didn't put my education at issue when I was writing my first comment. All I did there was express my opinion that that guy who barely graduated from high school before he became a drug dealer (this is probably a temporal flaw) cannot relate his life experience to the the direction my life is heading in.        

&gt;""The imprint of that kind of parenting can become a permanent feature in growing children ""

Yeah, I like that sentence too. What I described is one potential outcome I can think of. I can argue about others, as I do agree with the theory of multifinality, because my brother and I are two VERY different people.

oi_rohe,changemyview,1388692402.0,"I'm going to go with a slightly unusual approach here.  Your view should not be changed.

We as a species don't know what happens when a person dies.  By its very nature it is a difficult thing to study, anyone with any observations is too dead to tell them to us.  We've created a multitude of stories which explain it, most of which allow us to live forever in some other form, in some other place.  But we really don't know, and we probably never will.

The unknown is probably the most terrifying thing in existence.  I certainly can't think of anything offhand that scares me more than something that feels inevitable but is absolutely incomprehensible.  So being scared is normal.

Not only that, but since we have no idea what happens after death and have no evidence of anything supernatural, it's pretty reasonable to assume that dying is the total, permanent, eternal destruction of everything that is 'you'.  You're gone, nothing, unbeing.  I'd say you're trapped in oblivion forever, but that's not accurate, because there's no *you* to experience the being trapped.  Honestly I'd say there's more of a problem if that **didn't** scare you.

But not everything is doom and gloom!  There's been huge progress recently towards longevity.  Both biologically, with the printing of new organs and research that could allow us to reverse aging in humans; and technologically, with better and better understanding of how our brains work and an exponentially growing computational power to potentially 'save' a human consciousness.  It's hard to grasp how exponential growth works, but within five years IBM's Watson system could be generally available for about 2000 dollars.  It's a safe bet that within 40 years we will be able to add a year to everyone's life for every year that goes by.  Soon afterwards, we can reverse the aging, stalling people at whatever stage of life they choose.  Dying isn't a necessity anymore.  Be afraid of it, but let that fear push you to defeat death."

Willravel,apple,1388692562.0,"1) **Apple Creative Suite**. Create a powerful but intuitive suite of graphic design,  video editing, and web development software for Mac OS X and Windows (and Linux!) which undercuts Adobe by 50% and forces them to actually compete over professionals' business. I'd love to see Apple take a crack at designing their versions of applications like InDesign and Photoshop which are beautiful, easy to use, but can do a ton. 

Just as iWork is to Microsoft Office, Apple Creative Suite can be to Adobe Creative Suite. I'd buy that in a heartbeat, especially if it was a lot cheaper than Adobe (which I suspect it could be). 

2) **Mac OS X and iOS streamlined**. One of my favorite operating systems of all time from Apple was Snow Leopard (OS X v10.6). I'd really enjoyed the improvements made to Leopard, but Snow Leopard was almost exclusively about the goals of significantly improved performance, a smaller footprint on the hard drive, and greater efficiency all around. It's nice to get new features and new UI, but I'm a sucker for efficiency. I've really been enjoying Mavericks so far, and iOS 7 is really great to look at, but my iPhone 4 is struggling and I suspect my MBP could be running even more efficiently, especially with the great hardware Apple decided to solder to the motherboard. For Mac OS 10.10 or 11 or what have you, I'd really like to see a Snow Leopard like take on making the core OS and default applications lean and mean, running efficiently so as to utilize only what processing power is necessary and only taking up as much room on the drive as necessary. And for iOS 8, I'd like to see much the same. I get the impression from my experience with iOS 7 that iOS is getting a lot hungrier for processing power and battery power. With incremental progress in battery efficiency and mobile processing power, I think it would behoove Apple to, every few operating systems, go back to basics and look at efficiency. 

3) **Leak that the new Apple Headquarters is capable of interplanetary flight**. There's no sense in building a flying saucer if you can't have fun with it. Maybe spend a little on a viral marketing campaign to convince people that they're testing new thruster and anti-gravity technology, and that Apple plans on being able to move their headquarters anywhere in the solar system if they need. It'd be a fun, tongue-in-cheek way to play with fans. 

4) **Make up with Google**. Apple and Google seem to have been on the outs for the last few years. Part of it seemed to be different philosophies, part of it was the mobile phone wars, part of it was probably stuff we don't know about, but Apple and Google remain the two biggest tech names out there, and I suspect they work better together than apart. While I'm fine with Android and iOS duking it out, I'd like to see Apple and Google collaborating on creative projects, innovations, and pushing boundaries. The Redditor in me would like to see them team up for internet privacy or to take on the broken patent system, but I'd also be interested in them developing new technologies together, software and hardware. The two tech giants don't have to be exclusively adversarial. Plus, I hear Apple's new headquarters is capable of interstellar flight, and I'm sure Google Drive could help with that. "

Four approaches come to mind:

1) OP can ask his group of buddies for help before they all go out 2) OP can tell buddies which girl he is interested in. 3) OP can Alpha and **show** her that he is interested. 4) OP can continue as-is and expect the same results on future nights out.

Approach 3 will also establish with his friends (and the entire group) who he likes. If she reciprocates, even better.

I am good at leading men. I know what motivates men to respect me and want to do good things.

I am not comfortable leading women. I'm worried about them being attracted to me or me to them. I'm worried that I'm either micromanaging too much (and being controlling) or managing too little (and letting her get away with goofing off).

Just to give an example - if a man working under me comes into work drunk, I will make his day a living hell. He will be outside doing hard labor and will probably end up crawling through his own puke a few times. I'll have a one-sided conversation with him that basically tells him, ""Drunk and stupid is a bad way to go through life,"" and that'll be the end of it.

If a woman comes into work drunk, I can't do that because it's hazing, and I can't trust a woman not to rat on me. So, instead I send her to Medical, get her busted down in rank, and put her on restriction and extra duty for 45 days. I consider that punishment to be far, far worse... especially since I'll put LCpl Drunk and Stupid up for a meritorious promotion board in a few months if he wises up, whereas this woman's career is in the toilet.

You might also try older titles since this trend towards different puzzles and lots of storyline seems to be more recent. 

Maybe some of those Free To Play titles from Boomzap [Antique Road Trip](http://www.boomzap.com/pc/antique-road-trip-american-dreamin-pc/) and [Awakening: Kingdoms](http://www.boomzap.com/pc/awakening-kingdoms-pc/) are just HO or let you do just HO.

That being said, find out where the vibrations are transferring from (run a bunch of tests).

If your voice doesn't travel, but stepping in certain areas does, then you may be able to secure the wood in that area.

If you are 100% sure its the floor, you can get either mass-loaded vinyl or generic dynamat (this will be much more expensive) and line the floor, then put tongue-in-groove laminate on top of that.  This is a problem that is well understood by the folks over at /r/carav

mczbot,soccer,1388693304.0,"american confirmed.

would be kinda appreciated if you wouldnt spread bullshit. noone is pissed because good players left us. in fact, noone was remotely pissed that özil left. actually people were more cheerfull. because özil, and especially his dad, were both huge cunts and despite his talent, we were just relieved to get rid of mister troublemaker.
as talented as mesut is on the pitch, he has a HUGE ego, while now it might even be warranted, back then it wasnt. he was just another talented youth player but thought he had to be payed like a top star. in addition to that, he is also known to be anything else but a professional. he smokes, at least did back then, acts like a cunt in clubs and drinks more then he probably should. 
all those are ""qualitys"" that just dont fair well with the average schalke supporter. so people were kinda happy that we got rid of him. cause our club is bigger then a single player.

and neuer the judas, well thats an entirely different story. and if you would follow the bundesliga in a different way then just checking the espn highlights you would and SHOULD know that. neuer is born and raised in buer, gelsenkirchen. he was raised as a schalke supporter and soon even became an ultra. he was in the stands when we were champion for 1 minute in 2001, he was in the stands when we won the uefa cup. he cried with us, celebrated with us. as a fan and ultra. when he became a pro for us, he used that history as leverage with the fans. in every match he would wear a buerschenschaft (a schalke ultra group he was part of) shirt under his jersey. he used every chance he got to mock bayern and dortmund and confess his so undying love for the club and his supporters. even 4 month before he transfered to bayern he would climb the fence in the arena to start a anti-bayern chant with the ultras. and then he transfered to bayern. he went back on his promises, he betrayed both himself and the supporters. we were well aware that a player of his calibre would sooner or later leave the club. if he would have transfered to lets say united (who were also intrested), real, juventus or whatever club really, he would still be a club legend to this day.

zhrusk,tabletopgamedesign,1388693769.0,"&gt; Is this the name of the game, or just a placeholder?

It's a placeholder. Decktet games have a fun little knack of having names and the like be from the imaginary world the deck was made in. Once I have a ruleset I like, I'll make up a name and a fake history to go with it.

&gt; Your rules started out third-person, using a singular ""they"" (""They are known as..."" to refer to a single person). The first paragraph here switches to individual pronouns (""his hand""), and then the next paragraph switches to second-person (""your hand""). This all makes your rules sloppier and more difficult to read. Pick a style and stick with it.

For now I'll accede to your guilt-tripping and rework the rules to be entirely third person gender specific. (She, He, etc). But I think it would be good practice to write a different set of these rules in as many styles as possible to get a sense for the various advantages and disadvantages.

I'll edit the original post when I've finished so you can take a second look. Thanks for the help, by the way. It's been really useful.

edit: So remember when you said you hated third person 'they' used everywhere? Yeah.... I was making edits and I only used proper pronouns here and there, so instead of just throwing in a dash of gender pronouns I went for 'their'. Soooooo there's that."

vehementvelociraptor,malefashionadvice,1388693814.0,"Okay so I'm new here and maybe that gives me a different opinion on this.  Take it as such.

If I were to compare two metrics: fashion + fitness, and weigh them on a scale of 100, regarding which one gave me more confidence/feel better/etc.  it would be:

- Fitness: 85

- Fashion: 15

If I could choose between being the best dressed guy in the world with killer fashion sense, or have the body I have now, I'd pick my body.  It's done way more for my confidence than when I started dressing nice.

Based on my newness, this sub has strong tones of relating fashion to sense of well being and confidence.  Now this may be naive of me and giving posters the benefit of the doubt, but I think they're genuinely trying to help.  Fitness is a lifelong attribute that heavily influences how attractive you are.  Clothes are finite, and they get discarded because of wear and changing fads.

I dunno.  You have excellent points.  Larger or skinner guys might be completely okay with their body image and only trying to find out what fashion fits their current frame.  And that's perfectly fine.

However, here's an example.  I remember a post where a guy saying he has no butt, and all the jeans he has look flat and unflattering.  Someone said do squats, and i think this is perfectly acceptable fashion advice.  Sometimes you have to adjust clothing to fit your body, and sometimes you have to adjust your body to fit the clothes.

Unfortunately the distinction between fitness and fashion isn't as black and white as you'd like it to be.  That's mainly a byproduct of today's society and our views on perceived attractiveness of individuals.  There's always going to be a gray area.

Just rambling thoughts.  It'll be a hell of a long time before I give advice on this thread, but you definitely gave me something to think about."

Willravel,DaystromInstitute,1388693884.0,"I think we could probably go into greater detail about three things:

1) **The stories of Kahless.** From both canon and non-canon sources we can gather a decent amount about the time of Kahless beyond simply defeating one government and installing his own. As long as it's prefaced by a disclaimer that some of Kahless' stories are embellished, we could talk in greater detail about his story, which is absolutely vital to understanding Klingon history, society, and philosophy. 

2) **The Hur'Q**. I'd like a bit more about the mysterious invaders, once again from canon and non-canon sources. They demolished Klingon society for a generation or more, and were a massive influence. The Klingon culture that rebuilt itself after the rebellion was different than society prior, and that has lasting consequences. 

3) **The evolution of the caste system**. I'm sure we all remember the *Enterprise* episode ""Judgment"", in which Archer's advocate, Kolos, talks about how he lived through a significant social shift in the caste system. His father was a teacher and his mother a biologist, and these positions were thought to bring honor to the Empire just like being a warrior. But, as he grew older, Klingon society changed to where the only way to bring honor to one's self and the Empire was through violence, even if that meant murdering defenseless refugees. I suspect this is part of a pattern of going back and forth between being a pure warrior society, a la Ancient Sparta, and a society which is more balanced from our perspective, a la Ancient Athens. There's a lot of exploration to be done on this. 

I consider myself to be a casual student of Klingon history, as I find it absolutely fascinating and find mirrors to human history especially interesting. Last year I read Thucydides *History of the Peloponnesian War*, and found myself contrasting and comparing it to Star Trek. I'd be glad to contribute anything of value I can so as to make this as comprehensive as possible. 

BTW, it's Qo'noS, not Qo'Nos. The Q is capitalized because it's a proper noun, and the S is capitalized because it has a slightly different S sound (somewhere between ""s"" and ""sh""). The character that we call an apostrophe is actually a letter in Klingon with it's own sound and uses (similar to a breath), meaning the N isn't the beginning of a second word, so it's not a proper noun. And it's a normal n sound in North American English, so it doesn't require capitalization to indicate an altered pronunciation. "

You are conditioning yourself to get off under those particular circumstances, and it'll only get harder to uncondition yourself the longer you go.

&gt;Maybe a tiny fraction of the kids diagnosed actually have it.

There have been loads of studies proving that ADHD is in fact a real disorder.

Also note that what you are discussing is ***a disorder***, which is defined as a deficiency which causes life-inhibiting problems, like divorce or getting fired from your job or expelled or *severely bad grades*. 

This also implies that there is, in fact, a spectrum of attention: that on the left end (an arbitrary choice) is a person who can exercise focus and attention, and on the right end is the attention span of a flea. Those who fall closer to the left are people who can develop good study habits and maintain attention easily. In the middle of the spectrum is a person who can do real well if he learns good discipline and study habits. 

Somewhere between the middle and the right hand side, draw a line.Every person whose attention falls to the line's left is people without ADHD. Every person whose attention falls to the right of the line has ADHD. You'll find that they have a hard time paying attention in class, can easily lose focus and move onto a different task or subtask if its problems present themselves, and can't listen to people for long periods of time. 

It's normal to lose focus every once in a while. How many kids pay attention to school on Fridays five minutes before the last bell rings? Maybe they experience this once or twice a week throughout their lives. Good parenting (that does *not* involve throwing an iPad at a 5-year-old every time he/she gets fidgety) will usually fix this. Most parents who send their kids to doctors fishing for ADHD diagnoses are not doing a proper job parenting.

But for a select few children (and adults) it happens more frequently: what for a ""normal"" person occurs twice a week occurs four times a day for someone with ADHD. Teachers begin noticing the child can't pay attention. Maybe the teacher gives the in-class, outloud reading assignments to other children. She gets so frustrated that she moves the student to the corner of the room so he/she wouldn't distract his/her neighbors during class. He/she finds that putting books back into his desk is a bit of a bother so he just leaves them on the floor beneath his feet. He is such a slow reader that it takes forever to get through a page, so he skips reading assignments.

His parents don't understand why he is failing, and they blame him. The teachers blame him. The kids around him don't like him because he keeps interrupting them, unable to hold in his thoughts. He has a hard time doing things the other kids do, so he goes off to do things on his own. As a result of his attention problems, he becomes a loner, unliked by most of his peers.

Ultimately, ADHD is a problem with the Executive functions of the brain. The actual ""will"" that lets you make decisions and put effort into work. Those parts of the brain are underdeveloped.

[Russsel A. Barkley has a shitload of good talks on the disorder.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZpF2_IelWo) They're long and you probably don't care, but he's a doctor and he's done the research.

**tl;dr**: ADHD is real, but it's overdiagnosed because people don't realize what a ""disorder"" is in the field of psychology. It describes a ""quirk"" that's so prevalent it hinders a person's ability to live a self-sufficient life in normal society."

The skinny fat look seems to derive from the chest and the gut moreso than arms, legs, or back. If you are looking for a numbers goal, I would recommend replacing some cardio with lifting. Focus on the chest, back/shoulders, and do some core work.

Microsoft's recommended practices suggest using MDT to create and maintain base images anyway, and MDT can be used to deploy those images too if desired (WDS holds the boot.wim boot image for MDT to allow PXE booting, but it's not required to do it that way, just recommended)."

Now... Can we please talk about Sherlock riding a motorcycle??! I just loved that whole scene so much!  

1) we get to see Mary and Sherlock working together as if they had known each other forever 

2) Because it's such a tender moment to see how much Sherlock cares for John. We know this but in the scene with the bonfire, he is almost willing to burn for his friend.

3) It was so thrilling seeing Sherlock doing something that we know Ben enjoys so much (high-speed motorcycling). I wonder if it was actually him doing the stunts, like when they go up and down the stairs. So bad ass! 

4) Also, the way he acquired the motorcycle was very Sherlock but also very matrix-like with the hand straight out ""You stop for me because I'm Sherlock and I'm a god""

It's so hard to pick a favourite scene but I would say, I am more excited about seeing Sherlock channel emotions and doing things that Sherlock hasn't done in previous episodes. I.e. Kissing, being defeated, apologetic, daring, goofy, brotherly. 

This episode just made Sherlock so much more human and I love it!

Then there is the DLC.  There are 4 packs of cars available.  They barely go on sale and when they do, it's not that great of a sale.  What is worse is that they put the cars in the game.  See, if you want to drive a different car, you have to find where it is parked, pull up next to it, and push a button to switch cars.  If you don't have the DLC, you will still see the car, but if you try to get in it, you will receive a message saying you need to buy it and would you like to visit the store.

Finally, there just isn't that much to do in it.  Once you complete all the challenges, that's it.  It's just this lifeless open world to drive around in.

POGtastic,news,1388695508.0,"Yes.

A hazing charge will ruin my career. I can haze men because they understand what's going on (as my boss says, ""Pain or paperwork?"") and keep their mouths shut. They have a really shitty day, and they understand that the next time they do it, paperwork will follow. But they get that first chance.

Now, there are certain men who will run crying to the CO to complain that Cpl POG is being a meaniehead. But being a man, I am much better at recognizing that tendency in men. And yes, those men get written up.

With women, I don't trust them not to rat on me because I don't know how their minds work. I have also watched plenty of corporals and sergeants get run up the flagpole because they hazed women. Since I can't do any real physical punishment, I go straight to the next punishment and write up a charge sheet.

Now - if I went the other route and chewed the woman's ass for showing up drunk, I'd be seen by the rest of my men as playing favorites. ""POG made me weed the desert because I showed up 15 minutes late. How come he's just yelling at her?"" Cue allegations of her sucking my dick and me being a white-knight pussy-chaser.

Let's look at my options. I can do the following to correct this disparity in punishment.

1. Charge everyone who breaks the rules.
2. Be a chihuahua and just yell at people without having anything to back it up.
3. Risk my career and haze women.

2 and 3 are completely out of the question, so I'm left with 1. Well, the problem with men is that they hate to work for a regulation-thumping douchebag. And since the vast majority of people working under me are men, I do what works for men.

Yep, it's not fair. But we don't work in a perfect system, and I would much rather be an inspired leader to 95% of my guys while screwing over 5% of them than fail at being a leader because I'm trying to be fair to everyone."

On the vote: Some women could vote from the revolution on if they met the property requirements in some northern states.

With that generalisation in mind, yeah, it does tend to get better. Most adults - I would hope - would apologise and awkwardly stumble out if they walked in on people. There are also less house parties with people who aren't close friends, so people are unlikely to really act like that. 

But, if you go to straight clubs at university and get with girls there, in my experience it's pretty much the same. Some guys have just absorbed the stereotype that drunk girls want their attention so they seem to think of it as a game or invitation. Most people are fine, of course, but the idiots are the ones you'll remember. 

The only advice I can really offer is that next time you might want to go somewhere more private or accept it's probably going to happen. Doing stuff like that in a semi-public space like a party or a club does leave you open to ridicule or just annoying interruptions, though it would be nice if people could just mind their own business.

As for the original question, I think this very much affects the NFL, especially given the near meltdown the NFL was facing had Rodgers turned out to be gay. Fact is if someone said ""all gays should be put on an island and nuked till it glowed"" at my work, he'd be fired on the spot. Sadly not because everyone realizes how hateful that is, but just because it could end up in serious legal action against the company. Still the fact remains the person would be facing serious consequences. The fact that in the NFL it isn't a problem, says a lot about how Goodell is setting the tone for acceptance."

Most of the time, the special treatment is for stuff like disrespect. If I get gaffed off by a man, I chew ass and offer ""Pain or paperwork?"" They choose ""pain"" 100% of the time. They do their shitty task for a couple hours, and that's the end of it. He comes in the next day like nothing happened. We're cool.

When a woman disrespects me, I don't have any other options. I've seen plenty of cases where a woman fucked up, had to weed the desert, and then cried ""Sexism! Cpl Smith is making me weed the desert because he's sexist! Waaaaah!"" They then ask him, ""Did you make her weed the desert?""

""Yeah, of course I did. She started whining when I told her to clean the back room, so I taught her a lesson.""

Cpl Smith now becomes LCpl Smith because she took it personally and felt vindictive enough to ruin his career. I have no interest in becoming a lance corporal again, so I become the parole officer from Elysium.

""LCpl, at 0915 this morning, you violated Article 92 and Article 138 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice when you complained to me about a task that you were assigned. You are hereby notified that this counseling sheet will go into your personnel file and that further offenses will be dealt with administratively. Sign here.""

I know I'm being sexist by doing so, but I know enough to say that I have no way of predicting which women will shrug and say ""Yeah, I fucked up, I deserved that"" and which women will say ""How DARE he make me weed the desert! I'm telling the EO, that'll show him!"" Hell, I have a hard enough time figuring out what makes my girlfriend tick, and I've lived with her since April.

Some mages with AP ratios are ""allowed"" to support because their kit has utility in it, not because of their AP ratios. Annie is so vastly OP right now because she has high AP ratios (late-game damage), high base damage (early-game damage with little gold), and can land stuns often enough to bring utility (support role).

If Riot started giving every support high AP ratios so they could play mid, the support gold items would need a massive nerf so that they wouldn't acquire enough gold to deal tons of damage and make their lane partner irrelevant."

Breal3030,Supplements,1388696533.0,"The idea behind flameout is that it contains a higher ratio of DHA to EPA, which supposedly men ""need"" due to the differences in the way testosterone vs. estrogen affect omega-3 metabolism and levels.

It also contains specific isomers of CLA that are supposed to be the more ""active"" ones. This is NOT the same as the ""other"" you see listed on ""regular"" fish oil bottles as /u/phrakture said, but he is correct in that CLA doesn't seem to be all that exciting.

I believe those are the two main reasons why it is more expensive. It is presumably more expensive to explicitly control your EPA/DHA ratio than to just provide the ratio that occurs naturally in fish oil.

As to whether those differences ""justify"" the expense, I'm not really familiar with the detailed, current research behind DHA/EPA ratios and it's merit, but I have always been a fan of discussing fish oil in terms of DHA/EPA ratios instead of ""X-grams of fish oil"" in case it does turn out to be important."

As I come from NJ I'm about an hour from the Philadelphia Union and NY Red Bulls, which doesn't make it easy to take a trip there. There is a local team that I go watch play but they don't have much of a fan base at all unfortunately, and I'd rather see the local colleges play. This makes it tough for me to really get a good atmosphere for watching the game, and is why I picked up a European team when I got into watching more religiously. And truth be told, I hate them pretty much because I'm told to hate them, and while that may make me seem like a real plastic fan, when you don't have many options to really have a team to support, you have to take what you can get. And by joining in on the Schalke hate and other things, it makes you feel like you're a part of the club a lot more. 

If we had an active, supported league around here I would have no issue with supporting a tiny tier team, instead of the European juggernaut I ended up following. But that's just not around, and is what makes it hard to be a supporter of the game here in the states. Plus now I have a goal to one day visit the Westfalenstadion and stand on the Yellow Wall, and once that happens I'll be the happiest guy in the world. So I think fandom takes many different shapes and ways, and it just happens this is how I support Dortmund.

1. We can't know how good your memory is
* You're telling us about it ~30 years later, which is well-removed from the time we're discussing
* We can't contextualize *you*, much less others you talked to.  We don't know who's talking to us, essentially.
* Redditors lie, and there's no good way of verifying stories, particularly ones of the nature you're describing
* We have no way of referencing your anecdotes, gaining further information, fact-checking, etc.  A lot of what Josephus wrote was hearsay, too, but at least I can cite it and others can look it up.
* This subreddit runs the risk of getting reminiscing threads, rather than historical analysis and discussion

If there were a published ""thoughts of Russians from 1980-1984"", we could reference it, discuss the same content, interpret it, it could be fact-checked, etc.  We can't do that with an anecdote you type up, which is why we don't allow them."

Ehejav,worldnews,1388697278.0,"&gt;Many of the fighters in the Kashmir dispute are radical islamic fighters getting front line training.

Whether soldiers in the kashmir dispute are muslim radicals or not, the fight is not religious. It is between two countries who want control of the same region.

&gt;The reason there is such a thing as Somali pirates is that Somalia is a failed state due to infighting among islamic factions

The pirates themselves are not radicals inflicting their own beliefs on those they kidnap. They are the unfortunate victims of circumstance where crime is literally easier than the alternative for many in Somalia.

For example in the UK in the 1600s onwards the tax on alcohol was so much higher than on the continent and the general populace had so little money that smuggling was one of the major industries along the south coast of england. It doesn't matter what religion someone is if their actions are not driven by their religion.

&gt;In every arab spring country radical islam was involved, in Egypt the islamic brotherhood have a largely radical membership. Every country that is now involved in the fallout from the arab spring now has a firmly embedded radical islamic radical component.

If you'll notice in my above post, I said

This is definitely true where I'm from. As an unmarried father I'm not legally entitled to any rights. Even with a joint custody agreement if she calls the police she can take my son from me any time with practically no ramifications. I didn't start the process of filing for custody of my son until she ODed and claimed to be willing to sign them over because every lawyer I talk to has pretty much told me without her consent I'm fucked, so take what I've got.

I only know a few other single fathers and it's all the same story, if we aren't guaranteed a victory we're encouraged to NOT push the court issue because it's just going to cost us a lot of money and we're not going to gain any ground. Mom always wins with unmarried couples here."

temp9876,AskWomen,1388697522.0,"My parents played a sort of trick on me as a kid that had a profound and lasting effect.  It was really a minor thing, they took me to a wading pool to fulfill a promise of going to the outdoor swimming pool.  Totally insignificant right?  But it was one of those key moments that changes how you look at someone.  My parents loved me, but that didn't mean they would always be honest or fair if their interests ran contrary to mine.  

I've carried that through to every relationship ever.  I basically came to a place where I made the conscious choice to enjoy it while it lasts each time I cared about someone, but always believed in the back of my mind that it would end with disappointment eventually.  The end of each relationship would hurt, but it wasn't the end of the world, I knew the hammer would drop eventually.

Years and years with my husband have finally given me that trust.  The kind of all in absolute faith that you should have in someone you love unconditionally.  I could find him in bed with someone else and I would give him the chance to explain.  But it's only him.  I struggle with close friendships, family relationships, and personal connections because I don't really have faith in people.  Low expectations, so I don't really invest."

dirtyewok,coys,1388697771.0,"Article doesn't really cover anything that isn't openly discussed by every Spurs fan virtually everywhere.

When Ade is motivated he is more or less talismanic for a team...he was great when he first got to Monaco, City, Spurs and his loan to Real was fairly successful.

Truth is, if he could consistently perform at his top level we would never have been able to sign him.  He would have never gotten away from City unless it was to go to a team like Real.

When he isn't motivated he is a void on the pitch and has a history of being a pain in the ass to the team. 

I am hoping that, as dumb a decision as it was, AVB freezing Ade out of the team actually resulted in a wake up call to Ade. You have to figure that if AVB was so against having Ade on the team we would have tried to sell him. The fact that we couldn't sell him (and only seemed to have a single team with any interest) speaks volumes about how his market value had shrunk.  The fact that there was such a small market for his services may have served as a eye opener that as talented as a player is there is a level of bullshit that teams don't want to deal with.

AVB freezing him out may have opened up his eyes that he needs to actually work consistently, combine that with Sherwood reintegrating him and we can hope that we see the talismanic Ade from 2 seasons ago for the rest of the season because the alternative is the squad being stuck with the void that we were stuck with last season.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388698576.0,"Well, there are kind of two parts.

Yes, on *average* a eugenics programme could theoretically work.  You could try and breed people to be whatever you considered the most relevant traits.  Ideally evolution should do that for you, just more slowly (the most advantageous traits should produce the most children), though humanity has this odd population pressure due to birth control.

The problem is that 'on average' does not mean every individual.  So, so what do you do about people who are not quite what you're looking for? 

Oh and who gets to decide what are desirable traits?  In that regard it may be impossible to make work because you'd never have consistent agreement.  

Trying to breed out random defects is impossible because random defects are well, random.  Which might be what your professor was trying to get at.    If we decided black hair was strictly preferable to blonde hair in all circumstances you could fairly easily eliminate blond hair from the gene pool.  But eliminating various diseases (including many forms of cancer) is impossible because they're due to random mutations or mutations due to environmental factors.   If you wanted to go and eliminate particular traits that are not immediately manifest (say genes that make you susceptible to various diseases) you'd end up with a very complicated multigenerational problem because most everyone has at least some undesirable genes, so you'd need to keep trying to pair people in complex arrangements, and then cull/sterilize the offspring that contain the trait you are  trying to eliminate.

ReverendDexter,cars,1388698610.0,"Not really.  When it comes to handling on snow, what's important for traction is pounds per square inch between the tire and the ground.  A heavy car on big, wide tires is going to handle terrible compared to a lightweight car on pizza cutters because those narrow tires have higher PSI (note that I'm not talking about the air pressure of the tire).  Now, if you're trying to float on top of a loose surface (e.g. trailblazing through deep powder or mudding), you want to reduce that PSI as much as possible, which is why arctic vehicles and farm equipment have such wide tires (or even better, tank tracks which further increase the surface area over which you're spreading weight).

In terms of handling in general, a lighter car handles better than a heavier car.  There's simply less inertia to overcome, which means that they have an advantage in turning, braking, and accelerating.  That was Colin Chapman's big contribution: ""Simply, and add lightness"".  To this day, the Lotus 7 (aka Caterham), a car designed in the late '50s, is a benchmark of handling performance that few cars exceed."

Gebbeth,todayilearned,1388698796.0,"I am not the best at explaining stuff, so I'll copy something written in a physics book written by Jewett and Serway.

&gt; [Einstein] based his special theory of relativity on two postulates:

&gt; 1. **The principle of relativity:** The laws of physics must be the same in all inertial reference frames.

&gt; 2. **The constancy of the speed of light:** The speed of light in vacuum has the same value, [...], in all inertial frames, regardless, of the velocity of the observer or the velocity of the source emitting the light.

Remember that light has the same speed no matter what direction you look? Well, not only is this true for our planet, but for every planet, star, mouse or alien in existence. And indeed, not every planet or star travels in the same direction or at the same speed. It seems like something shady is at work here.

So how is this possible? Experiments tell us that space and time aren't absolute things. They can bend and expand and contract sort of like a rubber sheet. And they are linked to each other, that's why we call it the fabric of space-time. The book puts it very nicely:
&gt; If we accept Einstein's theory of relativity, we must conclude that relative motion is unimportant when measuring the speed of light. At the same time, we must alter our commonsense notion of space and time and be prepared for some surprising consequences. [...], keep in mind that our commonsense ideas are based on a lifetime of everyday experiences and not on observations of objects moving at hundreds of thousands of kilometers per second.

It seems that the only thing absolute here is the speed of light and it is space-time that twists and bends in order to keep this number constant.

Therefore, if you have two objects separating as in my example earlier, space and time will morph in order to keep the objects from moving faster than light relative to each other.

The cool thing is that special relativity has effects that can be observed, such as time moving slower for faster objects (time dilation) and objects appearing shorter in the direction they are moving (length contraction). We experience them with GPS, for example. Without the theory of special relativity, GPS just wouldn't work. GPS works through clocks, but the speed of the satellites is enough to make those clocks move slower and thus to make the calculations be wrong.

If you are interested in this, there are some thought experiments that every physics student gets to know and has to understand.

The orbit of one object around a fixed point can easily be described this way. But the orbit of one object around multiple moving objects is way more difficult to calculate. I'm not talking about the complexity of the calculation, but about very difficult mathematics. With one reference body, you just have an ellipse. With more than that, you get more complex curves, for which you have to find the correct parameters.

The problem with fast timewarp is the collision detection. If you warp too fast, it can happen that you miss targets, because you just jump over them. With everything on rails, the calculation time doesn't take longer if you enlarge the time step."

This understanding is coupled with me being fair and only meting out such punishment when I'm justified in doing so.

Women have no such reason because men differ in how they treat women. Hell, they might even benefit from losing me because another man might just let them off with a stern talking to (or even ignore them entirely, as many men do). So while men know exactly what will happen to them if I get busted down, women aren't quite sure... but they know it can't be any worse. And what's more is that I can't read them the way I can read men, so I have no idea if said female lance corporal thinks I'm great or hates my guts.

&gt; Yeah, no, with most people, it takes a fair amount deliberation and effort to kill, unless there are other dangers present like traffic, high falls, there is some sort of present health condition, etc. Freak accidents happen where you can get concussed, have a brain bleed, and die, but they are quite uncommon. Humans are pretty resilient and tough for the most part. 

Thank you. Lot's of people seem to think that they could easily kill someone if they punched them in the head. If that was the case deaths in combat sports like kickboxing and MMA (where the guys punch harder than most people can kick, and kick harder than a MLB player hitting a home run) would be a lot more common. The only way your average Joe is going to kill someone in a fight is by using weapons, holding on to a choke for too long, if the opponent cracks his skull/neck on the pavement or if the opponent has a medical condition.

The ""show"" is one of the phases during the round, while a ""match"" is a series of rounds to 121 points. If that's not clear, I'll need to make sure to clarify it.

I was considering lightly retheming it as a game of corrupt politicians earning influence for the two main political parties, but decided on just keeping the terms for Cribbage for clarity's sake. The crib would become the Council, the Cut would become the Mayor, and the suits would become the Interests, etc. Probably for the best I dropped that.

Depends on your definition of normal.  

A presidential candidate could run on a platform of pardoning him, win, and then do it, or a civilized country (notably in europe) could offer him political asylum, both or more.

He will likely remain something  of a celebrity his entire life, but not the paparazzi following you everywhere sort of celebrity.  I would not be hugely surprised if he ends up in Germany, and he can make a decent life for himself in Russia if they let him stay.  

His life would end up as some combination of Kevin Mitnick, Oliver North, and Daniel Ellsberg.  

But more likely he would end up as a Mordechai Vanunu, or just in jail for the rest of his life.

If you know how important the minimap in dota 2 is, then you'd probably realize how important it is in starcraft. And the thing is, you **still** didn't notice how important the minimap in starcraft is when you were writing your post. 

There's not a lot the two games have in common, but the minimap is an essential feature in both. In fact, in almost every game with a minimap that shows enemies, it's an invaluable tool. It's extremely hard to believe that you're playing dota at a ""very high level"" (which I would consider to be playing with pro-level players quite often) when you can't connect the dots yourself. "

And if I were running the Vikings, I'd be really annoyed that one of my players is putting the conversation on politics instead of football.

3. Because he's interchangeable with every other decent punter, the organization doesn't lose by firing him. If he were a wide receiver, QB, even a really good defensive tackle, he'd be tolerated. But he's a *punter*. The most replaceable player on the field. Hell, even the field goal kicker is more valuable.

Now, if Kluwe had said, ""I believe in this issue enough to give up my career,"" that's fine. But instead he's sitting there yelling about how mean the Vikings are for firing him. No sympathy at all."

So this might just be my fear for myself (I really don't know how I will cope if I one day can't physically play video games) but I do wonder how physical limitations will factor in. 

I do think you're right though. Maybe they won't be playing CoD and Starcraft, but I for one hope to still be playing **something** with my wizened, arthritic claws in the nursing home. "

But he is not a small dog person. He has said that if I find no other options and feel that I have to give this dog away, to call him and he will reconsider.

That's a good amount of relevant details I don't hear much about (other than people generally claiming it's difficult without specifying), so thank you for that. There's no doubt about it that it's very demanding work, I'm definitely not naive about that even if I can't know it from personal experience.

The falling standards aren't a good thing, of course, even if it would mean more women on the job. Generally, what should be priority is that the standard is set somewhere to make sure that whoever passes can actually do what is required of them. To lower that for the inclusion of more people sounds great from an idealistic equality perspective (though does it really?), but when you consider the consequences in practise, it can be dangerous. 

To exclude women by default, to me, doesn't seem like the best option to me though. If a woman is motivated to do it and can actually pass, why throw that away?"

ballookey,Cumberbitches,1388701716.0,"I love how John's conversation with Mrs. Hudson over tea presaged his meeting Sherlock later.

Mrs. Hudson was angry with John because he had avoided her. He explained saying it got harder to reach out as time went on. 

Then John was angry with Sherlock for a similar if much larger reason, but of course Sherlock rarely shows his humanity. He values his friends, but is crap at articulating this. We know from the scene where he's hearing John's voice that he's missed his companion, but will he just come out and *say* that it got harder to reach out as time went on? No. Not Sherlock. 

So instead of Sherlock explaining properly, we're left with the scene between John &amp; Mrs. Hudson to tell us what we need to know about Sherlock &amp; John.

A related thing happened between Greg Lestrade and Sherlock - with DI Lestrade, we got the warm bear-hug embrace that we might have wanted to see between John &amp; Sherlock, but of course Watson was too ravaged by his friend's death. He was closer to Sherlock, so felt it too keenly. Lestrade gives us this gratifying moment instead."

postExistence,GirlGamers,1388701928.0,"The issue is far more complex than anyone is willing to acknowledge, and articles like these only make it worse.

What makes it so complicated? 

* The different gaming subcultures. E.g., pc vs. console, RPG, JRPG, Fighting games, sims, etc.

* the fragmentation of the ""gamer"" from other geek cultures - comics, film, novels, japanese animation, etc.

* the need to distinguish between ""hardcore"" and ""casual"" (and the fallacies involved)

* Distinguishing the acceptance of games by the business world with ""legitimacy""

* The stigmatization of women and LGBT gamers in the community-at-large

* *The need to identify as a ""gamer,"" and its reputation(s) held by society-at-large*

* Poe's law as applied to nihilistic media and humor like The Simpsons, Family Guy, etc.

Each of these, and various other sociological issues I have not pinpointed, need to be addressed for this entire issue to be proverbially swept under the rug.

Unfortunately, as you may have guessed, the stigmatization of women and LGBT gamers occupies only one of the bullet points in this list. That's because I believe it's only one piece of a large problem, and that it cannot be fixed until all the remaining points are addressed as well. 

Misogyny, rape culture, and LGBT-phobias are learned behaviors, and are acquired or developed as an individual matures and identifies his or her place within society. Gabe from Penny-Arcade demonstrates this in his editorial that was posted here a couple hours ago, and only God knows what will happen in the years ahead. But the only reason Gabe came to this conclusion was because he acknowledged who he is today is a product of his past, but unlike Gabe most of the assholes don't understand that and refuse to change, oblivious to the plights of others.

So yeah, Mr. Scimeca, continue patting yourself on the back for not being ""those guys,"" but remember by removing yourself from the problem you are also absconding from any potential solution. So if these problems are ever solved, don't come back cheering yourself for making a change when all you did was bury your head in the sand."

Weirdsauce,conspiratard,1388702090.0,"Brodievonorchard, respectfully, the research and publication linking autism to vaccinations was done by someone named Andrew Wakefield.

I worked for a half decade in public schools. One of the things that i can tell you is that the diagnosis for autism is much more nuanced and refined than it once was. When i was growing up in the 70's and 80's, autism was generally given to someone with trisomy or some other aberration such as fetal alcohol syndrome when it was visually obvious the child was autistic. But in my years of working in public education, the diagnosis of autistism was given to a myriad of children- many of whom looked very normal, could interact with others but had very specific challenges in one or more academic arenas. Then you also have the inclusion of children with the oft diagnosed Aspergers Syndrome. You can expect more of these sorts of diagnosis to continue to grow.

TL/DR: science and psychology continue to develop and expand new definitions for ""austism"". "

DukeCanada,canada,1388702174.0,"With respect to your CSLP comment, it seems you're taking a strictly economic take on the program. This isn't bad, but it doesn't do justice to benefits of student debt. Assuming you're going to university for the right reasons, you should leave with a set of skills in your field and a degree to back up your qualifications. 

The simple matter of the fact if that if you don't have a degree it's very difficult to begin a professional career. CSLP gives people this option. If you want an education, and you want a *chance* to work in a specific field, you have it. Yes, 2 billion dollars is quite the price tag, but at the end of the day it's worth it. 

If you want to talk about privilege vs lack of privilege, I'd argue that CSLP works in favour of those born into middle class/lower class families. Otherwise, these people couldn't access higher education and we'd be stuck with a system akin to that in the states where certain (qualified) individuals are not continuing their education after highschool because they cannot afford it. Obviously the debt in itself isn't good, but good can come of it. 

Finally, from a state cost perspective. There's studies which clearly indicate that higher education has direct health benefits. We may spend 2 billion dollars in tax dollars in education funding, but we spend 211 billion on healthcare. The savings to healthcare perpetuated by University/College education surpass that 2 billion mark quite readily. I guess you could say that the indirect saving of education to healthcare are worth the direct investment.

Finally, at the end of the day I'd like to read more into those stats. I have a sneaking suspicion that the debt doesn't actually have to do much with those numbers. Anyone earning 17,500 a year is working at minimum wage. I'd wager that those people are not using their degrees effectively, and it's not the debt that's stopping them from progressing in life. The others who've cleared their debt by 29 found field-related degrees and have managed to pay their debt off quite readily."

Not at all. I said I'd have to think about it, as you cutely quote me over and over. Proving that I can easily understand why someone would pick either side. It seems it is you who is incapable of conceiving anyone possibly picking safety over freedom and dependence over responsibility. 



&gt; Yes, literally all women are straight, never want to be divorced, want kids, and want to be dependents instead of independents, or gay, or childless.

Third time now that I repeat that **women had considerably more rights if they weren't married.** Maybe the bold will help. Gays, women who didn't want kids, and independent women had an easy way out of some of this terrible oppression. Still no draft and first on the raft, of course (gotta remember that rhyming quip).

Honestly that extra $68/month worth not having to bring anything but myself and my change of cloths and the more professional employees and cleaner areas were a huge plus.

Also, those trainers decided on THEIR OWN will to do that job. Nobody forced them to get in the water and if you were getting in the water with something called a *killer* whale I think you'd know the danger you're putting yourself into.


This is the problem in so many reddit threads; there can't be good or bad things a company does. It's all got to be evil in some way. Even if their saving of manatees is as you claim a ""PR stunt"" who the fuck cares?! They're still saving manatees!!

Edit: I also would like to add that I did a ton of research on whales in captivity right after the killing of the trainer incident (I was going to be in Florida later that year and was trying to decide my opinion on SeaWorld before I went) so I looked at a lot of the information in a much more unbiased light than how it was presented in this documentary.

You have some limitations on how to deal with it since you're pregnant, basically it's a matter of inflammation in your wrists putting pressure on the median nerve, and since ibuprofen and other antiinflammatories are off the table you've just got to cope in other ways.  

 * ice your wrists

 * reduce salt in your diet and stay hydrated

 * avoid intensive fine motor functions, lay off the knitting, sewing, writing, typing and mouse use etc.

 * use good posture and ergonomic positioning when doing any of the above, 

 * avoid having your hands elevated for extended periods, no hot water or other irritants that make your hands swell.

By the time it starts hurting it is already inflamed, so you can't just take a break until the pain stops, it will just start up again.  Use tools to help make fine motor tasks less difficult like pencil grips to avoid using an acute pincer grip when writing.  The way you use the computer, especially if your wrists rest on the edge of a desk or your laptop can really irritate as well.

Braces can help in some situations but are not a solution alone unfortunately.  You've got to use everything in combination to reduce the inflammation."

As neither a doctor, man or parent it is not my place to say whether it's alright for a guy or not. My opinion however is that it is wrong to circumcise a baby unless it's for medical or religious reasons, and it is right that if the foreskin is causing a boy or man medical problems he can get it removed in a clean, consented setting of his own accord. I have not heard of many cases of women having medical trouble with foreskins. 

To sum up: baby boy circumcision for no reason: bad. baby girl circumcision for no reason: bad. consenting male circumcision: good. consenting female circumcision: if you have a reason for it, and it's done in a professional setting, well then you should be able to get it done. My guess is the trauma of it and the history of it is why it has been made it illegal. "

In real life, that would be an extremely risky move, but more believable than the quick-change stunt airbag in the middle of the street — with the added bonus that it doesn't depend on adding *more* players and structure to that scene than we saw in the Reichenback Fall.

mludd,AskWomen,1388703095.0,"I don't really know if I've met any feminists who truly hated men but when I was younger (late teens and early twenties) I hung out with a lot of people on the far left of the political spectrum (I'm talking syndicalists, hardcore marxists, trotskyists, even a few stalinists and maoists. The kind of people I'm not even sure exist or are organized in the US).

I definitely ran into some oddballs in those circles, female separatists who refused to talk to men, radical feminists who would argue that Marx's theories on class warfare should be adapted to ""gender warfare"" and women who read the SCUM manifesto and seriously argued that in an ideal world all men would either commit suicide or be castrated. And even now in my thirties I still from time to time bump into women who remind me of these women, definitely not as often but occasionally they do pop up.

By no means do I think these women are representative of feminism as a whole but my experiences in my youth also made it clear that a lot of these women tend to phrase themselves as if they speak for all feminists (and women). And as with a lot of political movements the extremists tend to be the loudest ones and most obnoxious ones (if you do run into them)."

This is merely my opinion, so take it as you will, but I have seen from my experience that the church employs a sort of ""us vs. them"" mentality when it comes to a lot of their doctrine. Also, even more damning, is the church's unyielding insistence on the use of absolutes, i.e. ""You either accept the Book of Mormon as absolute truth, translated by the gift and power of God and his prophet, or you damn it to hell. --Russell M. Nelson"" (It was in a general conference about fiveish years ago, I'll look for the actual talk if requested.)

The idea that you're either a member of God's true church, or you're a member of Satan's great and abominable one, is a very toxic one, utterly nonconducive to the culture of love and acceptance that the Church also tries to teach. In many of today's issues, there is no such thing as black and white. There are as many shades of grey as there are people debating the issue. Yet prophets and other GAs essentially say ""if you're not with us, you're against us,"" and I strongly believe that it is that very mindset that gives rise to the hatred and antagonism you speak of.

If the defender backs off a bit, as some do on Lebron, it's not too tough of a shot.

Conversely, a wide open catch-and-shoot is of course what we think of when we think of when we think of ""assisted 3"", but in reality how many wide open looks does a number one option like George get per game? 1? 2?

Also, she is the soon to be sister-in-law of the sisters behind Pixiwoo and Real Techniques brushes. Focus on Makeup- Drugstore to Highend.  
2. [gossmakeupartist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA) is another top favorite. He has so many tricks and tips and posts a couple times a week. He is a little festy at times (love it!) and is also based in England. Focus on Makeup- Drugstore to Highend.  
3. [Leighannsays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeZn7qRN3JKVcEYK_dDg7JQ) is another great personality. She cracks me up with her mannerisms and quirks. Focus on Makeup- mostly Drugstore to Mid-range, but can dabble in Highend, she also has some hair and nails sprinkled in.  
4. [emilynoel83 (Beauty Broadcast)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtC8m_F7jX2fGOQ3_nomg4g) and [Beauty Broadcast Express](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtC8m_F7jX2fGOQ3_nomg4g) are the same youtuber. The first is more lenghty videos with hauls and tutorials and the second channel is quick 2-5 minute reviews on a certain product which are uploaded Mon-Fri (Friday tends to be her husband reviewing a ""manly"" product). Focus on Makeup- mostly Drugstore to Mid-range sometimes Highend.
5. [missglamorazzi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5zSySQab9SA6Wz569WDgqw) typically has a good range of beauty items not just makeup. Her ""empties"" videos are probably my favorite ones that she does. Focus on Beauty- Drugstore to Highend.
7. [MakeupbyTiffanyD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrKdCadbo4eN_toHMa4-FSA) can be hit and miss with me. She sometimes can get really long winded about certain things and I have to just stop watching because I can't stand it. Be warned she is a very fortunate lady and talks about things that can make those who are less fortunate cry- lol. Not that she is rubbing it in your face or anything, but just she afford very nice things. Focus on Makeup- Mostly Mid-Range to Highend though not above drugstore on occasion.

mislabeledhuman,transgendercirclejerk,1388704001.0,"Passing is kind of a weird thing. You have to think about it as if Male and Female were on opposite sides of a line and in the middle is ""the gender divide"". So a bushy brow might push you towards the masculine side, but if everything else looks female, you'd probably be read as female. It's only a problem when there are enough cumulative gender miscues that you'd be clocked.

However, if you have something like a REALLY prominent brow ridge or something, that would cue the person to look for every minute detail which would push you towards male; maybe you're a little taller than average too and your jaw is a little too wide, and those wouldn't be noticeable on their own, but with the obvious male feature you'd be clocked.

&gt;Is it just me or do 90% of people pass better than they think?

We tend to have a lot lower self-esteem than average and we're also going off of our preconceptions of what we expect to see, after years of seeing yourself in the mirror as one gender that's what you expect to see. So any minute thing that's wrong to us seems like an unpassable flaw. 

I don't know if the passing better than they think thing is necessarily true though. You have to think about how much time and effort the posters put into getting their face/angles/lighting just right and taking 100's of photos just to find the right one. Sure they can pass in that one photo, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the real word.

I do think it's good in a way, because it gives people confidence to go out and be themselves, but at the same time I think it gives people unrealistic views of how much they actually pass.

I think the best photos to judge would be the same ones you send in if you wanted to get plastic surgery; straight on front, straight on side, etc, no makeup, no hair in the way. Basically the most unflattering photo of yourself you could take. And if you can pass in those, then you REALLY pass.

But yah, I don't think passing/not passing should stop people from dressing how they want or being recognized as what gender they want. And not looking the part shouldn't mean you ""fail"" at being your gender. Passing would be nice though...

Okay, advice. Obviously, you need to swatch. I suggest you also compare the schematic measurements to your body measurements and/or the measurements of other well-fitting clothing items you own. Even if you get perfect gauge, if the waist on the sweater is 4"" below your own waist, it's still going to fit weird, as an example. 

Knit the sleeves first. I find sleeves the most boring part of the sweater, because they seem like they should be small/quick, but they are actually not that much smaller than one of the body sections. (Also, on this sweater specifically, the body is more interesting to knit.)

Seaming your sweater using sock yarn in a similar colour will make your seams less bulky.

He'll probably still do his best to make you orgasm, and I don't see that as a bad thing, but he'll know not to blame himself if it doesn't happen.

I don't think it's a big deal.

And I think the best time to bring it up is pretty much as you mention, in response to ""did you come?"".

Bringing it up in advance just makes it sound like a big issue, and then he *will* take it as a challenge (if it's important enough for you to bring it up before/outside sex, he'll assume that it's something that bothers you, and so making you orgasm will become much more important to him.

But during/after sex, if he asks you if you came, you can just be honest, and say that no, you've never been able to orgasm, but it (and he) sure felt amazing, so it's no big deal to you."

Mrs_Nakker,piercing,1388705395.0,"I got my cartilage done almost a year ago and for me personally here are the problems I encountered and what I did to help :)

I had the same secretion you are speaking of and just did my absolute best to NEVER touch it.  The only time my hands graced it was when I was in the shower and gently cleaned it with warm running water.  The only other cleaning regime I did were the salt soaks.  I had a bump on the back of mine and started to freak out.  I thought it was a keloid and instantly began to regret getting my ear done.  My ear, like yours, was red and just annoyed.  I decided to (although rather quickly) change the jewelry.  I KNOW that people do not recommend that you change it yourself, but I didn't have the fortune of finding a ""professional"" to change it for me.  As soon as I got a shorter piece of jewelry in and continued my cleanings the bump disappeared as did the redness.

So long story short is you might not have an infection.  I personally did not have an infection it was just annoyed with the LONG length of jewelry.  I have sorta thin ears and my skin heals super quick so I had all this ""swelling room"" on my piercing bar for nothing.  Maybe some of the things I did will help you too :D

EDIT:  I would be happy to take pictures of my now fully healed piercing to show you how well it did after I changed the piece."

Thus: living != perception, but your perception = the present

So then, your body is living. You will perceive your body living, microseconds after it has happened. Thus, your brain is in the present and your body, from your perspective, in the future. That's my spin anyways, he's on a somewhat similar string of thought.

It's really helped me kind of develop a visual language to my thoughts through my clothes. 

What I've found really helpful (and yes this might sound effemiinate or gay but IDGAF) is to play dress up in front of your mirror every now and then, and just let your thoughts dictate what you'll wear next. It's a bit of a safer environment to make mistakes, if you're concerned about that. It also helps you understand the ""scope"" of your wardrobe, meaning how many looks you can put together with it and how many ""moods"" it can express. Just like you can't be expressive with your singing or painting without practice, you can't be expressive with your clothes without practice. And don't be afraid of making ""mistakes"" if that's genuinely what you feel like wearing. Maybe it'll look bad, but there's *something* about it that you like, and instead of not wearing something because it looks ""bad"", you'll learn why it looked ""good"" in the first place."

But I was so oblivious to the signs that I just didn't understand that she was yelling for my attention. We even slept in the same bed and cuddled a bit, which is weird because I hate cuddling. I hate using the word friend zoned but I did it. I just saw her as a friend even though she was very attractive. It's sad because I was one of the few men who didn't use her for sex or abused her both mentally or physically. But after a month of living in my couch she said she was going to go back home. It's sad because a week before she broke the news; I figured it out. But I was on a boat sailing to Alaska and couldn't say anything to her. Then I did it again. I visited her a year ago because I was visiting Arizona. Anyway, we got really hammered and I slept on her bed but before anything happened I passed out. I remember her kissing me.

I recently returned to WoW and the whole feel of the game is completely different. I really like some aspects of it, like how easy it is to get to the action with all the things there are to do, but other things have sure gone down hill, like the general community.

Now when you first create a char you are spammed immediately to just join a guild for levelling, and often these guilds don't have any conversation going. You have to seek out guilds that care about socializing. The guild finder is nice but it's not the same. The world (except for the latest expansion areas) is pretty empty, and there is endless annoying spam going on in trade chat. I don't exactly know why, but despite the hundreds of people sitting around in Stormwind or Ogrimmar, it feels loney.

The quick access to ""action"" has been a trade-off for the community. It's still there if you want it, you just have to go find it. In the past you were basically forced to interact. Now I can get all my gear ready for the ""real"" endgame and never talk to a person if I am so inclined.

My hypothesis about ""big budget"" MMOs is my hypothesis about movies. When money is involved, the investors want something that will appeal to as many people as possible. The ""theme park"" is a proven setup, and aspects in general that are easier appeal to a mass audience. The biggest games in the world are simple addicting games. People in general don't want to spend hours trying to get back their corpse. There are some indie games out there with features you mention.

2. I don't see the luster that I usually associate with shell, particularly in [this pic](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0275/9117/products/IMG_1120_5805bbf2-b0e4-4adb-b86d-82e60cadabd1_compact.jpg?v=1388169122), which also shows creases atypical of shell.

3. Never seen OSB do shell pennies before, and I've been following StyleForum's OSB thread since its inception.

I'm certainly open to having my mind changed, if you had a differing opinion still.
