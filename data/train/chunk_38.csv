And that's wrong. You can't run each and every Windows program in Linux, and you also won't find a 100% identical alternative. However, you also can't run them on a Mac (as far as I know). The whole problem is basically false advertising.

As for the problems you've mentioned, my experiences have been different. I'm using Crunchbang 11 (64 bit) which is based on Debian, I'm using Flash in both Firefox and Chromium without any problems, I can play whatever audio and/or video format I like including DVDs, touchpad and WiFi worked perfectly OOTB, it's a dual-boot machine with Windows 7, I'm using NTFS on both of my external drives, and I can connect any Android phone without a hitch (I don't have any iDevices). The only thing I actually do have a problem with are proprietary nVidia drivers (what a surprise) for my GeForce G105M; they keep crashing any program displaying video, i.e. Firefox, VLC, and so on. But since I'm not gaming on my notebook, using the nouveau drivers is a perfectly fine solution.

So, for me, Linux is the perfect desktop OS. And I'm very grateful for that."

c74r3byw,RATS,1390568482.0,"Little back story behind Dexter.

I bought his litter mates Snoop &amp; Boo from a pet store. My cage at the time could only fit two, however the sales assistant assured me that a new litter was coming in tomorrow and he'd be paired up immediately. 

I went back into the shop 5 weeks later, and there is Dexter on his own, in a glass box, with nothing but a hide &amp; food. I ask another sales assistant how long it's been single for, and she tells me about 5 weeks. She also tells me that Dexter is now very antisocial, and will constantly bite and attack anyone that puts their hand in the cage to get him. 
I'm pretty scorned when I hear this, and by this time mum had bought me a bigger cage (one that can fit four ratties in) I immediately buy Dexter to take him home to his litter mates.

I was warned by the shop that they may probably never mold together, and it could take weeks &amp; months until they are associated with each other. When I brought Dexter home, I put him in his brother's old cage and placed them side by side. There were a few curious sniffs from Boo &amp; Snoop, and no sign of any aggressive behavior whatsoever. 

I decided to let Snoop &amp; Boo out to play, which would allow them to run over the cage where Dexter was sitting. Boo gave a sniff and ran off, but Snoop was all over the top of Dexter's cage.  
20 minutes after Dexter coming into the house, I took the lid off his cage (the bottom had a shallow aquarium tank in the bottom) and Snoop jumped in the cage to his brother - they had a quick sniff, and Snoop jumped back onto the ledge, and waited until Dexter jumped up on it with him.

At that point, they both ran off together to play in my bathroom.

They've been inseparable since.

Wait, I'm about to use... [*MATH*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gENVB6tjq_M)

8 hours a day:

24 hours / 8 hours = 3 real-life hours for every 1 hour on this clock.

Or maybe there are 16 hours in a day? After all, we have a 24-hour day that's split up into two 12-hour periods.

24 hours / 16 hours = 1.5 real-life hours for every 1 hour on this clock.

Now for the minutes!

60 minutes / 8 minutes = 7.5 real-life minutes for every 1 minute on this clock.

(And, ofc, that means that there are 7.5 real-life seconds for every 1 second on this clock.)

But what about the Minecraft day?

Assuming we use 20 minute (0.333) day and night cycle and divide it into two 10-minute periods, we use:

10 minutes / 8 hours = 1,25 hours on this clock for every real-life minute.

So, if there are 8 minutes for every hour, one real-life minute is 0,15625 on this clock."

I started reading around after I hit my son on his behind once over a year ago, saw the shock in his eyes, remembered the deep, deep resentment I still have towards my parents for hitting me a lot when I was a kid, and swore to never, ever hit my son again.

I now treat my son as I would have liked to be treated, with emphatic communication, reasonable boundaries, and companionship - which means including him into adult life much more (e.g. we worked on remodeling the bathroom for almost three hours a couple of weeks ago and he helped me without a single whine - not even four years old).

""Purge"" implies that you can stop being bad by doing good things, while ""atone"" says that you can ""make up"" for bad things by doing good things. It's possible ""purge"" doesn't mean what it did 400+ years ago (I'd have to check etymonline), but if that's the case modern translations aren't changing at all, just modernizing the language.

dusmeyedin,gaming,1390570000.0,"Yeah, those are hard to see because the fireballs ""vanish"" for a set number of frames and then reappear. (Same with the sonic booms and yoga fire, etc.)

I recently heard that the ""hadoken"" in Japanese do not translate to ""fireball"" at all. They're apparently supposed to be a vacuum or other raw force, which Ryu and Ken draw from their inner ""qi"". (Held to be near the navel, in Chinese and Japanese traditional internal medicine.)

So in Street Fighter, Ryu and Ken were actually using their spiritual strength to create a vacuum in their hands and to throw it at their opponent.

...

Another fun fact. Although the fireballs became Ryu's and Ken's sig moves (arguably even moreso than the Dragon Punch), in the first Street Fighter they did not have the fireball projectiles. The primary character to have those was Sagat, the end boss. And he did not have a Tiger Uppercut then either. By the time of the events in SF2, Ryu and Ken had evidently borrowed Sagat's fireball maneuver, and Sagat had evidently borrowed their Dragon Punch!

Edit: oh wow, thanks to the Street Fighter experts who corrected me, regarding the fireball attack in the first game! You learn something new every day. I wonder what was to stop the player spamming those at the AI then...?"

GhostsofDogma,explainlikeimfive,1390570120.0,"My issue with all of this is everyone says 'they came to associate x with y,' but they never explain how this actually happens. It's not like the boy would coincidentally feel horny every time he was about to get a whipping, so I don't see why he would associate the two. It sounds more like he already had the fetish if he interpreted the whipping like that. 

Someone can have misconceptions about what's going on in their body, as all children do, but these things are simply grown out of when they begin to apply them to the real world and find out they don't work. I don't see how a simple association can create an intense, lifelong obsession like that. And I certainly feel like hardcore sadomasochism goes much too much against natural instinct to avoid pain to be developed so easily. 'Vanilla' sex would be practically a rarity if it was that easy to develop. The reasoning honestly sounds like an old pop-Freud relic accepted by everyone just because Freud's name is on it.

aDDnTN,AdviceAnimals,1390570137.0,"the problem is that all those positions are going to immigrant citizens who will take all that experience and knowledge with them when they go back to their home nations.

and american's will be left without any highly trained experts in the workplace or in the classroom.

many of the immigrant prof's only spend their gov't issued research grants to bring over immigrant grad students, many of whom already have PhD's in the subject they are studying. The prof's do this because they know that the ""FOB"" grads won't DEMAND to graduate after performing an adequate amount of research, which would make room for the next class of grad students (whom are generally from the population of people who paid for the research, ergo who provided that graduate program). 

These prof's know that because of the strong requirement of absolute obedience to authority that their home nations social systems instilled in the FOB grads, will allow them to have ""slave labor"" and they use that to churn out research, so they can get tenure and do more research, which the schools (many STATE run institutions) turn a blind eye too, because more research = more profits for their board, shareholders, and executives.

Also, a lot of the higher paid long term prof's (educators really) are being pushed out, because they won't play this game and they demand i high salary, that eats into the bottom line.

all the while, pulling money and knowledge out of USA and denying a generation of (smart hard-working) USA citizens access to cheap/free graduate training, just because ""it's cheaper"" and ""more efficient"" for the schools (more research gets done, more money into the schools coffers, more extravagant pay for the board, president, athletics, etc). It's more efficient to keep the prof churning out papers, have research assistants that are not interest in doing anything with the degrees obtained or even interested in graduating, and have some of those other FOB grads teach the classes that the student population (aka THE MARKS) pay premium price for (that price reflecting the highly experience professor who go pushed out or pushed into the lab).

add to that the extortion levels of tuition they charge now because of the ""easy access to money"" their students have, yet how they always claim to be barely above minimum funding levels to the state gov't that support them.

Everyone makes money and gets something at a good deal EXCEPT THE STUDENTS. Bankers, board members, shareholders, executives, elected officials, etc all the sycophants and middlemen rake in cash. Those students who get HOSED would have been the next generation of experts and would have made up most of what once was the middle class.

That one person would be a major difference in a hostile situation, an assailants attention is divided and you have twice the chance essentially of controlling the threat. 1v1 is much more intimidating and under those circumstances a threat to your life and reason to shoot would be higher.

phaqueue,woweconomy,1390570578.0,"This is an excellent question. Personally - I'm on the exact opposite side from you - I only ever have crafting professions when I'm at max level, I only use gathering while leveling up (and nowadays I don't even bother with that since I outlevel the zones so fast)

Instead of saying ""This is the best"" I'll give you an overview (at least from my PoV) of each of the professions I've leveled to max and let you choose what you like best. 

**Enchanting**

This is my recommendation to people looking for a profession for their ""main"" or at least the character they plan to level first in the next xpac. The reason for this is two-fold. First, the profession provides its own materials, and you'll get at least some of them just by running dungeons and questing. Generally, all raw materials are expensive when a new xpac launches, and being able to farm while you level is  a great perk. It's also nice being able to disenchant your old gear instead of just vendoring them (the ones you don't want for xmog at least)


**Jewelcrafting** 

I've had JC since way back in TBC and have been making gold with it since then. Not a bad choice to level, but it can be a bit pricey to level from scratch. (seems you have the gold to spare though). It also takes a little bit to learn the cuts, so you might not be making a profit from cutting blues immediately - but eventually you can (also depends if you have spirit of harmony you can burn on learning new patterns)

*I mentioned these first as they have also been announced as being changed in a big way come WoD. I really don't think this will be a huge deal, I think both enchanting and JC will still be profitable after the xpac*

**Tailoring** 

I actually just recently picked this one up on my warlock. Just got it to 600 a couple days ago. Crafted PVP gear isn't a bad way to make some gold, and might actually get better with a new season incoming. Spellthreads are a solid money-maker and bags always sell - and will likely sell even better with people getting free 90s soon enough.


**Inscription**

I'll save the best for last here. This has been my go-to gold making profession since Wrath. Back before I quit, I was over 80k gold, mostly thanks to Inscription. When I came back I leveled inscription and began making gold with it again pretty quickly. (came back around 2 months ago with about 8k gold. Currently over 50k - even after buying epic flying and gear/gems/enchants on multiple characters)

Also, Inscription is generally the cheapest to level as with each level of ink, there are multiple different herbs you can buy to mill for it, so you don't really have bottlenecks like other professions, there's basically always a cheap option to use to level with. 


Hope this helps you out!

keypuncher,Republican,1390570720.0,"&gt; Except it doesn't work like that. Until the new changes that forced insurance companies to accept people with pre-existing conditions, you would be very unlikely to be able to secure new insurance if you were diagnosed with a serious illness and either lost or wanted to change your insurance provider.

Unless you didn't go without insurance for more than 6 months - in which case pre-existing condition exclusions didn't apply.

If you were without insurance for more than 6 months, then you got a job with employer-provided insurance, and there was an exclusion period (usually 6 months to a year) during which pre-existing conditions were not covered... after which, they were."

I can tell you that as it relates to these two games, which prior to League/Starcraft had been the most popular competitive PC games in NA, people talk in all chat ALL THE TIME.

As a matter of fact, when mIRC was still around and even on the league forums, players had public rivalries (some still do) with other players and would get into typing contests online or verbal conflicts at LAN.

Not sure what game you're referring to, but in 1.6 at least, people would talk shit in mm1 (all chat) all the time.  As a matter of fact, leagues had to implement sportsmanship rules (which were hardly enforced) in order to curb some of the talk when streaming (originally HLTV) became very common for Invite division matches.  

Oh, and by the way, almost everyone did it and it wasn't called bad mannered or whatever.  It was expected to talk shit, hardly anybody was nice to other teams.  You would scrim teams and run your mouth if you shit on them.  Different generation of gamers, different mindsets.  By the way, not the typical ""I fukt ur mum"" CoD talk, but more so relating to the skills of the players or telling them they got clutched, etc."

phaqueue,woweconomy,1390571245.0,"High-priced doesn't mean that they will be good to make. Some of the high-priced ones are really GOOD or rare to find (expensive patterns, etc) however, there are quite a few that are high-priced and aren't really ever used, meaning that the only people to buy them will be those who want every glyph. A lot of people (especially on alts it seems) will buy the glyphs they plan to use, or that are good, but if it's not that good and expensive, they will generally pass it up.

With inscription, I go for volume. I set my minimum profit around 5-10g (I think it's currently at 10g) and make anything that give me that profit. With inscription, your real gold comes from quantity not single big scores. (although when you see that 500g glyph sell it is a good day)

A great tip to maximize profits on your scribe, buy herbs whenever you find them cheap. Do the math and set a ""base price"" for your ink (I use around 5g per ink as my base) Buy any herbs you can get that are below that price per ink (don't include the ""rare"" pigment/ink - Starlight Ink in this xpac) in that calculation. Start a bank alt and give them basically all herb bags. Use them to store all these crazy herbs (guild banks work well for this too if you have one at your disposal).

When you have some time, like while watching TV/movie, mill a ton of herbs and make the ink. Make your shoulder enchants with the Starlight Ink and consider these all profit if you don't include them in the calculations of your herb price. (I find the caster one sells the best/most expensive for me)

Also, buy Inks and Pigments that are below your price as well, don't limit yourself to just the herbs themselves. If you can find suppliers to COD to you for a set price do it. You can never have too much. ( I bought 2k Ink of Dreams the other day because they were at 2g per.)

If you set your ink price below the average price for Mysterious Fortune Cards on your server, or see a ton of ink/herbs you can mill that would bring you under that price, make a ton and sell them. I'm still selling off Mysterious Fortune Cards for 5g per from ink I bought for 2g per. I'm mroe than doubling up, even though it's taking a little time to sell, it's still easy money. 

I tend to cancel/repost/restock every day, I don't use a separate seller for my glyphs, just sell them on my scribe, which happens to be my main. 

Hope some of this helps, if you're interested feel free to hit me up in game if you're US (phaqueue#1767) or on reddit!"

Gov't exists because it is the most efficient way for a populace to govern themselves. You take a group of people 1500 more and have a source for something they need, a surplus of something they don't need and gov't will form spontaneously.

The problem is that when people start taking advantage of gov't and use that gov't to create a general inefficiency that they personally benefit from, it breaks the system. Rinse and repeat, and you get what we are dealing with now.

The problem isn't that the gov't is rigged to help the rich. It's that the rich have rigged the gov't to benefit themselves. They always will attempt to do this, look back at history.

In fact the longest stable gov'ts in our history are the ones that more or less were run by the greediest person in that society (the king, caesar, etc) who also could keep his military well paid and happy. They only failed when the people's will was rejected and they were oppressed for too long without any good reason other than ""so the king can profit"". Or they failed because someone came along and gave away the kings horde which shifted the power away from the king and allowed some of his scheming subjects (generally Dukes and Lords) to overthrow him."

I live in Germany and since we've had to deal with government observation twice in the past decades I am probably a bit more concerned about this than most US Americans.

I wasn't really a brick and mortar guy before, I usually just ordered some printed tees via internet, so I didn't really see how L fit me anway. When I read up about fit and how certain clothes should fit, I went into a store and actually tried on a shirt a size smaller for the first time in 4 or 5 years, and it made such a huge difference to me.

I only bought one tee and a shirt in the first week, just to see how it would feel. Afterwards, my old baggy shirts felt so incredibly... well, baggy and bad-looking to me, I *really* felt uncomfortable in them. I scratched together what I had left and bought a few basics that fit me at least.

OlderThanGif,CFL,1390573285.0,"The psychology of it doesn't make me any more hesitant to remove the convert. Football is a strategic game, probably the most strategic physical team sport out there. Analogies are often made between football games and chess matches. It would be crazy to think about making changes to the game of chess such that there was less incentive to sacrifice pieces, for instance, just because there's a psychological barrier that makes people behave irrationally when thinking about sacrificing things. Chess is a game which rewards rationality over irrationality and I don't believe that's a bad thing.

The same should hold for football. It's true, conservative coaches would make irrational decisions to avoid ""taking points off the board"". Instead of calling them ""conservative coaches"", I'd be more inclined to call them ""bad coaches"". When you're in charge of a very strategic game at its highest (professional) level, coaches should be expected to be aware of their psychological biases and be able to rise above them. If you can't think about a decision rationally and overcome your own psychological biases, you are not fit to be the coach of a professional team.

This also gives a chance to further distinguish bad strategists (who would use their gut) from the good strategists (who use their brain).

That said, I'm still a bit iffy on removing the convert just because the benefits of it are so slight. Over the course of a game, how much time do the converts take up? *Maybe* five minutes? Big deal."

I suppose a portion of the energy of the torpdeo once it detonates could be absorbed into subspace, which would explain why torpedoes at full yield don't produce massive gaping holes rather than just scratches.

The fact that they needed an entire fleet and the specialist knowledge of Captain Picard to take down a single cube in First Contact demonstrates this, and we see torpedo impacts during that sequence."

That's what I'm saying. Private information such as pregnancy is none of FB's business.

&gt; Maybe you could set up a company page for your business and that way you don't have to have a personal page for yourself?

Well, that's the crux. We do have several pages for the audience / consumer  where we market our goods. But the B2B marketing, acquisitions and sales is done  via the private profiles. The reason they all work via FB as opposed to email is because they don't want to work with a business but with a person.  Businesses are scary. If you ""friend"" them on FB, you are much more trustworthy. Also, if they see you are ""friend"" with other people from the industry, it is more likely you can establish contact with someone. It serves as a network of trust. It's also prestige to have certain people in your contacts. Most of these people have more than 5000 contacts and can't add anymore people. Hence if you're in that list, it makes a good impression on other people. My roughly 1.2K contacts are still modest in comparison to others and it's only possible because I work quietly behind the scenes and am not in the spotlight. But anyways... we digress ;)"

But the heliocentric model was *ridiculously bad* at replicating the most essential of phenomena, the periods of planets' orbits, that it wasn't used for any kind of practical astronomy.

They do set salaries higher than average: I was set to work a minimum wage job, but universal makes a point of setting wages slightly above minimum (mine started at $8/hr over the minimum $7.25 or something).

Now, for performance work, you're probably going to go through a different process. My understanding is that performers have auditions instead of interviews. I can't say with certainty right now that you will or won't have an interview on top of that, nor do I know much about the pay scale or the processing of new employees in performance (orientation and all that).

The boy's behavior is rarely corrected so that the girl's boundaries are respected.  

I saw [a news story on reddit a few weeks ago](http://news.msn.com/us/girls-mother-praises-boys-kissing-suspension), where there was a very young boy who had a crush on a little girl in his class, and kissed her on a couple of occasions after she'd told him no repeatedly.  The school did suspend the boy, but caught a LOT of flack for calling it sexual harassment (I think it definitely qualifies, even though they were only like 6 y.o.) and eventually changed to calling it ""misconduct"".  There are a ton of people out there who are mad pissed that the boy was suspended at all, and who demonize the girl's mother for approving of the school's action.  

When I was a kid, there were little boys in school who had crushes on me - some just hair pulling or rough housing, but there was one in particular that bordered on stalking and harassment.  I was always told it was ""sweet"" and just ""puppy love.""  When the behavior persisted after I'd let him down nicely dozens of times, I was told to ""just be nice.""  I didn't want to hurt him, did I?  

I've continued to have problems with stalkers and LOTS of unwanted attention from friends/acquaintances/coworkers...  It's hard to be blunt about a ""no"" when you know no one will listen to you anyway, and you'll be the one seen as rude for saying it.  "

zegafregaomega,buildapc,1390575309.0,"That's a pretty tough question considering you'll be running most games at 100+ fps on account of your video card. In order to really get anything out of playing games at 60fps+, you'll have to hit 120 or else there's not a whole lot of difference (diminishing returns and all that), so 90 fps shouldn't be your goal. Keep in mind 144hz monitors are exclusively TN panels, which means they won't represent colors as accurately, but not all TN panels are created equal. [I dug around for a video I saw a while ago on LinusTechTips](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6wIMaYjklE) for a monitor that's a good compromise of color/responsiveness/framerate, if you're interested.

On the other hand, 780Ti has the bandwidth necessary to play games at 1440p relatively well, but a single 780Ti won't run all games at 60fps, so 1440p is really a club for SLI adopters.

The Russian Orthodoxy, after the fall of Constantinople, considered itself the *last* true Christians. It's not that the Catholics were also-Christians-who-we-disagree-with, they were apostates within that theology. If Byzantium had authority to the Russian Orthodox, it was only because they derived that authority directly from Rome.

Now, you could make a claim about derived legitimacy. The German Empire, however, derived its legitimacy much more directly from the Holy Roman Empire. The Russians make their claim effectively by default after the conquest of the Byzantines."

Life isn't easy, and we can't think that we're always gonna feel 100% happy all the time, cause that's not gonna happen. I'm just gonna tell you my real opinion about this. Each one of us is a living being, a person who has the luck to live in this world, someone who one day was put in this universe, to give this place a purpose and to find a purpose himself. I dont know how old are you, but you must be young since you're talking about 'class', just imagine for a second the years you have been living in this place we call 'Earth', and now think of all the things you have been experienced. You pointed out some things like 'I'm too unattractive to ever attract someone' and 'I'm too autistic to ever form a relationship'. Okay, now just imagine how many people the world has. 7/8 Billion, maybe? And why do you define yourself as 'unattractive' or 'the idiot of my class' for e.g.? Because 4/5 living people said so? Okay, so what about the rest? Who are they to judge? And who are you to believe them? They're just someone trying to fit in this society. Being a member in a society isn't always easy. Its hard, in fact. Because everyday, just like you, a lot of people feel down just because a bunch of idiots are trying to look good in front of each other, in front of people they don't even like! Unfortunately, that's how society works, and we can't do much to change it. But we can do something to change OUR place in this world. You're the only one who can do it, you can accept it or be accepted. Your future is in your hands, not in anybody else, so why letting others decide it?

Another thing, when you say 'I'm too stupid to ever succeed in school let alone outside of school'. Do you know the story of the fish who watched all day the birds flying in the sky, and he thought he was so silly and dumb, just because he couldn't fly! So he convinced himself (and all around him) that he was so stupid because when he looked at the sky, everyone around could fly but him. One day tho, he decided he didn't want to look up anymore, and so he realized he was comparing himself to the wrong 'people' all this time. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that, you seem so young and life has so many things to teach you yet, so when you say 'I am a loser and forever will be', we never know what life is saving for us, and ""After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer."" (William R. Alger). 

So don't let others, or what you think others think about you, define who you are. Cause only you can judge yourself, you're your own judge.

I'm sure you also know cool people, and I'm also sure you have people who CARE about you (I do), you have a home, you have lived good experiences in life too, you know that, so try to focus on the important things you have in your life. Try to be near to positive people, and go out a lot (with people or not, a walk by ourselves is also very relaxing), try to medidate if that helps you everytime you're more stressed (I do that, so thats why I always recommend it to people). And remember, that you can talk to me everytime you wanted about anything! I like meeting new people, so.... Don't compare yourself to people who aren't even worth it, just be yourself, with your flaws and strengths, cause you are unique in this world, did you imagine that? There's nobody like you in this reality, and you can be whoever you want to be! So focus in the important things, like you. I wish you sincerly all the best!"

Just leave.  To hell with whatever happens to her as a result.  She is being abusive, whether intentionally or not, and you deserve better.  Let her take it how she wants, it's not your problem or your fault.  Start making arrangements for yourself, stop worrying about her.  If she thinks you are so bad, then she can see what life is like without you.

Being trans, transitioning, etc, is *NOT* an excuse to be shitty to people.  Especially people who care about you.  She's a grown woman, she should know better.

ConstipatedNinja,AdviceAnimals,1390576018.0,"A parsec is a measure of distance. Roughly 3.262 lightyears. A parsex is a joke.

And for those wondering, the Kessel run thing in episode IV was a total gaffe, as evidenced by the script noting that he was trying to impress them with obvious misinformation (which is why Old Ben gave that *the fuck you say* look). Later, to fix this obvious oops, the Kessel run was made into a particularly important smuggling route that was 18 parsecs in length and the general path came dangerously close to multiple black holes, notably the Maw cluster. Han was capable of shaving distance off rather than time due to skirting closer to the black holes along the path. Thus the fact that being 6 parsecs short was a fucking huge gold star for the Millenium Falcon. Lucas later noted that this was actually due to the ship's highly advanced nav computer, and not due to any particular speed capabilities. The computer was just capable of calculating a much shorter ""safe"" route."

Smokeahontas,relationships,1390576081.0,"Stop trying to meet women with the end goal of having a girlfriend. Just get out and meet people. As an introvert, I know that's easier said than done, but that's really what it comes down to.

Spend time with our current friends. Make new friends. Pick up an interesting hobby that fulfills you. Stop focusing on how to get women to like you and start focusing on how to like yourself. 

Ask yourself what you have to offer a potential girlfriend aside from your looks. Looks and attraction are very important, but they're only one variable in the equation. 

Are you interesting? Are you interested in other people? Can you carry a conversation that isn't bemoaning your ability to find a girlfriend? 

I had this guy friend in college who you remind me of. He was always complaining about how he couldn't find a girlfriend, girls wouldn't look past his looks, he didn't know what was wrong with him etcetera etcetera. 

The thing was, the reason he couldn't ""get girls"" was because of the above. He was so focused on ""getting girls"" that he never considered what it was about him that would make girls *want* to get with him. He was a very smart guy, built his own computers, had extensive knowledge of obscure Russian literature, and volunteered at the local cat sanctuary. But he NEVER played any of that up when he was talking to girls at parties; he was so focused on ""getting"" them that it never occurred to him to advertise what made him interesting.

Censorship of this type benefits the vender of the medium.  It prevents people from being offended (oh noez!) so that a station or channel can maximize its viewership.  It benefits an establishment which gains from limiting the public discourse, like the U.S. government for example.

I have really mixed feelings about the jacquard. While I feel like the design needs something to say ""we're in the Olympics and we're from the United States!"", I feel like the jacquard is very Mary Maxim style and kind of infantilizing in a way. If an identifying US-style flag was absolutely necessary for the design, I would probably do a smallish one near the chest. I don't know if I would add the Olympic Rings on top of the flag.

schm0,boardgames,1390576535.0,"Came late to the party, glad to see I'm not the only one who saw this and thought the same thing.

Regarding cost, their explanation is laughable:

&gt;We wanted the game to be less expensive, which is exactly why we created this Kickstarter. We don't want to skimp on components, and wanted everything to be top notch and the best we could possibly make. But we all understand that higher quality means a higher price. There are several ways to reduce the price of a game (less quality, expansions, poor artwork), but we didn't want to do any of those things. Instead, we plan to be able to include a lot of extras, for less expense, and provide you with the best game possible at the best possible price.

That casually omit a very simple solution: don't make a 15 minute game that's filled with tons of components. If they cut the number of components down by half, the cost would go down too. 

Indeed, in addition to EVERYTHING you wrote, this game seems entirely impractical for its format. It just has too many bits to manage and even in the Q&amp;A they admit how much *work* the players will need to do to actually accomplish things in the game:

&gt;This game is very demanding in terms of needing people to help keep everything flowing properly. We don't think solo play would work very well, since there is just so much to do. For instance, when it is your turn, you are playing as quickly as you can (moving your figure, drawing cards, killing zombies), and the other players get to help by adding zombies to the board, help with new and killed zombies, and doing some of the other pleasant chores associated with each turn. (If you had several additional appendages, it might just be possible to play by yourself, but isn't it more fun to face the zombie horde with your friends?)

So, not only do am I rushed during my own turn, but now during someone else's turn I have to rush to clear bits off the table, help calculate values, etc? Pleasant chores, my ass.

No thanks, iello.

CrazyPlato,changemyview,1390576886.0,"You're forgetting the outside context of the Civil War. America was founded on a group of political dissidents deciding to separate themselves from a governing body that they felt was not representing them properly, despite overwhelming military force. Naturally, the American Revolution was a success, and it inspired a lot of revolution since. The French Revolution is said to be inspired at least in part by the Americans' success, for example.

Now this is where the Civil War comes in. The slavery issue led to a huge divide in the nation, and the pro-slavery South could see the writing on the wall as Lincoln took office. Faced with this situation, the talk began to turn into ""well, this is a governing body that is failing to represent our interests (slavery was the lynchpin of the Southern economy and industry, and abolishing it would be catastrophic to the way of life in those states), and we've tried to make compromises to accommodate their opinion (allowing a divide between pro-slavery and anti-slavery states). Now that we're being backed into a corner, we should stand up and secede, just like we did in the American Revolution.""

That's the big thing at play here: this was the first time since the Revolution that groups have tried open rebellion. What if they'd succeeded? It can be argued that a big reason that rebellion hasn't really been tried since in the US is that the Civil War was a failure, that the US ultimately managed to hold the country together by force. If the South had successfully revolted, and the pattern had been established, there's a good chance that both resulting nations could have devolved into a state of near anarchy: any group with just enough resources to revolt would be willing to try, just because previous events lended themselves to the thought of success. How long before the Confederacy would be fractured into the North and South Confederacy? How long before those subgroups fracture further? Remember that the US has a lot of land to hold together, and as these groups splinter off it becomes harder to hold them by military strength (remember the Roman Empire). Eventually, it can be argued, it would be near impossible to maintain a ""nation"" in the country.

This is purely hypothetical, as this entire discussion is purely hypothetical. I just want to point out that there's a lot that you seem to be missing in your view of how things might have gone. There will always be discord in politics, always two groups with conflicting interests. If the war had succeeded, and we had two nations instead of one US, they would rapidly form two more groups each to disagree with each other: a ""conservative"" north and south and a ""liberal"" north and south. Of course, all things are possible, but that includes negative outcomes too."

benk4,explainlikeimfive,1390577142.0,"Let's say I want to open up a gas station.  Unfortunately I don't have enough money to get it started.  So I come to you and ask if you want to be partners.  We each chip in half the start-up cost and each own half the company.  So we split all the profits.  Alternatively maybe I chipped in 75% of the money and now I own 75% and get 75% of the profit.  

Let's say in a few years we want to open up a second location, but we don't have the money.  We could go find a friend and tell them that if they give us the money for the 2nd location, they buy a one third of the business.  So we open up a 2nd place, and now each of us owns 1/3 of the business.  When profits come we split them 3 ways.  

What the stock market does is brings this to a larger scale.  Instead of being a deal between a few people, it's a deal between thousands.  How it works is the company issues shares.  A share signifies one ""part"" ownership of the company.  If there's 100 shares, every share signifies 1%.  If there's 10,000 shares, each share signifies 0.001%.  When a company wants to raise money, they offer the sale of shares to the public.  You can buy them and gain part ownership of the company.  This can dilute the previous owners percentage (for example if you had 1 share out of 100, and the company issues 100 more shares, you went from owning 1% to .5%).  The idea is that a lower percentage of a bigger company is more money.  

What the stock market does is allows people to buy and sell these shares to other people.  If I owned 100 shares in McDonald's, I can sell my ownership to someone else.  I simply post a price that I'm willing to sell for, and if someone comes along willing to pay that price I transfer my ownership."

phaqueue,WoWGoldMaking,1390577553.0,"Couple of questions... Do you enjoy farming (mining)? How much time per week do you think you spend flying around mining? Do you have any high level (minimum for 600 profession is 80) alts to speak of?

 If you don't like/don't have time for mining, I might recommend dropping it for something a little better. My go-to for people with 1 toon is enchanting. Since it essentially provides its own materials, it's easy to farm the materials to level it if you don't have the start-up capital to just buy it all from the AH. 

With enchanting, you can honestly make gold just using TSMs ""disenchant"" search, just make sure your prices are up to date as possible (either scanning the AH or using the TSM app).

You can also make some easy gold farming old instances (bonus of xmog gear and pets from there as well). See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoWGoldMaking/comments/1un1je/what_is_the_best_way_to_make_gold_if_im_only/cele8cr) for a post about old instances that are quite easy to solo - if you're a class that's ""good"" at soloing (namely Blood DK, Prot Paladin, Warlock, Hunter) you might be able to do some more difficult content as well. 

Some other little tips and tricks with enchanting:

Check the prices of Abyss Crystals vs. Infinite Dust on your server. Infinite dust is ALWAYS in demand in my experience... you need a TON of it to level enchanting, and it's also used to make Frostweave bags, and people always want more bagspace.

A lot of times, you can buy Abyss Crystals for well under that you will make from shattering them and getting the infinite dust (enchanting recipe). 

Also - people will sometimes (read often) post MoP epics for less than the price of a Sha Crystal... you can easily buy these and disenchant them then post the crystals for some quick profit, added bonus you have a chance to proc 2x Sha Crystals when you disenchant epics - can be maximized further by getting Enchant recipes that use Sha Crystals and selling those on the AH instead of the raw crystals.

If you're DEAD SET on mining (I generally can't talk much about making gold with gathering profs as I abhor them myself - I have better things to do than just fly around collecting raw materials). Check the prices of ore vs bars on some of the lower level Materials - things like Thorium, Mithril, etc. People are still leveling professions and will need this stuff - and if you can buy the ore for the right price, you can simply smelt it all then repost it back up with little/no effort (set it to smelt it all and go make yourself a sandwich or something). 

Inscription is another option, it's quite cheap to level (multiple different herbs per ""level"" of ink, so you can always find a cheap option to use) and makes good gold, but it takes a lot more involvement than a lot fo the other professions do.

For your blacksmithing. Check prices of things like the epic belts/pants. They sell pretty well on my server still (just sold a dps plate belt for 9k today). Also, PVP gear still sells decently, and may see a big resurgence with the new PVP season on the horizon. Belt buckles can be worth crafting as a BS - check prices if living steel vs the buckles and see if they're worth it (and get to crafting if so)

If you want some more tips/help/whatever feel free to hit me up in game (if you're US - phaqueue#1767) or on reddit and I'll try to help as best you can. I just came back a couple months ago and was starting basically from scratch after 3 years off, and I'm currently a bit over 50k liquid with probably 50-75k in stock..."

huphelmeyer,todayilearned,1390577564.0,"**From Wikipedia**: As meteoroids are heated during atmospheric entry, their surfaces melt and experience ablation. They can be sculpted into various shapes during this process, sometimes resulting in deep ""thumb-print"" like indentations on their surfaces called regmaglypts. If the meteoroid maintains a fixed orientation for some time, without tumbling, it may develop a conical ""nose cone"" or ""heat shield"" shape. As it decelerates, eventually the molten surface layer solidifies into a thin fusion crust, which on most meteorites is black (on some achondrites, the fusion crust may be very light colored). On stony meteorites, the heat-affected zone is at most a few mm deep; in iron meteorites, which are more thermally conductive, the structure of the metal may be affected by heat up to 1 centimetre (0.39 in) below the surface. Meteorites are sometimes reported to be warm to the touch when they land, but they are never hot. Reports, however, vary greatly, with some meteorites being reported as ""burning hot to the touch"" upon landing, and others forming a frost upon their surface."

Willravel,environment,1390578278.0,"Most California water usage is for irrigation for agriculture. If we killed all of the lawns in the state, that would mean about 5-6% of water used (as of last year, when I took a geography class) at the absolute most. Only about 10% of California water is residential and commercial. If we're serious about conservation, we need to look at better ways of managing agricultural usage for peak efficiency. IIRC, about 3/4 of all California water is used for crops. 

We need more pipelines from the Sierra Nevada and even the Rockies. The current aqueduct system is a terrific feat of engineering, but it's no longer sufficient to meet California's needs, which are just going to keep growing. [Governor Brown](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/us/a-new-plan-to-fix-california-water-system.html?_r=0) unveiled a plan for two new pipelines last year, which is a start, but we simply need way more. Since the state is, at least temporarily, in a better place financially, I think it would be a good idea to do a two-year progressive tax increase and bond sale to raise money for a series of pipelines to be constructed. 

We need to have better monitoring of agricultural water usage. I've grown up knowing California farmers and even playing on farms, and I know there are a lot of honest, hard-working, salt of the earth etc. folks out there just doing what they can to make ends meet while producing food, but between negligence and the need to cut costs, there's a lot of water lost. 

Finally, we need Federal money. I love that California has made a huge fiscal comeback, but the United States depends on California being a bottomless pit of fresh food, and we can't afford to spend what we need to spend to deal with our water situation. Considering our state has contributed far more in Federal tax dollars than we've gotten back consistently for decades, allowing other (lesser) states to rely on our stability, even when we were in financial crisis, it's time we got some of that money back to invest in the state and the country's future. 

By all means, we should take steps to reduce waste like getting rid of lawns, but taking 5 minute showers and rock gardens in our yards isn't going to solve the problem. "

&gt; The beings that want to 'throw off' scientists are advanced technology that does not want to be 'found out'

Sufficiently Advanced Aliens, huh?

The first thing I'd do is carefully define what kind of tech they are. Not all tech is created equal, and it's not all interrelated. Be careful not to think of it teleologically. The gods probably don't give a damn about nuclear power, but they might not like transistors. This might make your world Dune-like - the galactic politics is based around, in a way, the one technology that they aren't allowed to have anymore. Control of human-enhancing technology is essential to make up for AI in that universe.

One you know what avenues of tech you're restricting, it'll be easier to make laws to fuck that tech. If your SAAs are computers, for example, then they just need to make internal polarization cause the breakdown of current-carrying metals. This law, although very specific, has some cool applications - glue a battery to a sword and you'll make it disintegrate. If their technology is primarily visual, then optical study will be forbidden to people - increase the amount of light that is reflected from glass, for example, and every window and lens will be cloudier. Mirrors, however, will reflect much more light, making the Archimedes death ray a bit more realistic. etc."

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1390578616.0,"To add on to this, it wasn't *entirely* racial.  Converting to Judaism would subject you to Germany's antisemitic laws, and practicing Judaism was sometimes the difference between being classified as a Jew and a *Mischling* if the person in question had 2 Jewish grandparents.  Additionally, because the main way of proving you weren't Jewish was grandparents' baptismal records, it was possible (though unlikely) for someone to have sufficient documentation to prove German or mixed status while being 100% Jewish ethnically.

Note that in all those cases converting to Christianity after the Nuremburg Laws wouldn't help you--you couldn't go from being Jewish to being a *Mischling* if you had 2 Jewish grandparents by converting to Christianity--conversions had to be performed prior to the law's passage.  So for OP's purposes converting to Christianity would never help vis a vis the laws of Germany (though as /u/Domini_canes points out, it might've with respect to other countries).

Anyway, a good example of this phenomenon was [Edith Stein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Stein).  She was a Catholic nun who converted from Judaism, and was killed for being Jewish ethnically."

Residency is something that is required to access benefits, but there is a small loophole. When any woman applies seeking coverage (and indicates that she is pregnant) we open grant her 45 days of coverage on the presumption that she will verify her information with us. During that 45 days many services that would be provided by PP or an OB/GYN are covered. So in theory you could travel to a more liberal state and apply to get this 45 day coverage, you could then either never follow up or tell them you live in [insert location] and that coverage would still be guaranteed to you.

Many states and communities have different scenarios and programs may be helpful. We also have a lovely staff at our local health department called Medicaid Obstetrical and Maternal Services (MOMS) Program as well as another non-profit.

I would say that the best bet that many women have is to contact their local Health Department and see what services may be available.

FeatherDie,AskWomen,1390578922.0,"&gt; Has anyone noticed this trend in real life?

Yes and no? I think men are less likely to seek out the opinions of other men because it can be seen as weakness, rather than they don't want validation from everybody around them. I'm sure they choose women they are attracted to as a comparison test. ""Am I as hot to this person as they are to me, that validates my hotness."" Something like that. I also agree with Little_Lion, attractiveness in men is pushed as *only* when attracting women. It doesn't have as much of an influence on other aspects of life. This is NOT the case when it comes to society and women. Looks (at least in our heads) can be an important part of every interaction. 

If you ever visit a fitness sub there are plenty of men seeking validation/approval/opinions from other men...so sometimes it really depends on where you do your comment shopping.

Note: I also can only give personal experience and frame of mind. I'm not the female hivemind.


&gt; What makes the need for approval from everybody so important for young women?

There will never be a point where people don't want approval from the society they are a part of. While being yourself is important, fitting in (to your own niche) is also important if you want relationships with anyone/everyone. I think those who are young are certainly more susceptible to this, as they may not have the experience or confidence necessary to validate themselves and give balance to the tug of war. "

I went to my school's counseling center first, and was matched up with the person who was available. This didn't work out a couple of times, but worked out perfectly the last time. Then I moved.

I still haven't found a psychiatrist that I like (mostly grumpy old man pill pushers), but I did find a therapist. My company has an in-network search tool where I can pull up all of the providers who take my insurance and filter by things like gender, location, taking new patients, specialty, etc. It's not that much use because I have to google each practitioner to find reviews and such. I think it may have been just a random google search where I stumbled across my current therapist's website. She seemed open-minded and empathetic in her description of her practice, so I scheduled an appointment and have been seeing her for quite a while now. 

Honestly it's exhausting trying to find somebody who fits. There are sometimes subtle indicators that it won't work out in reviews, but it won't ever say ""THIS PERSON HATES GAY PEOPLE."" I judge how it'll be from the first meeting. If they react poorly to something I say, if they are patronizing or condescending, if they won't listen to what I say, they're not the right person.

For psychiatrists I'm thinking it's a bit different. They're doctors, not therapists (usually), so their bedside manner is often lacking. They can be encyclopedic when explaining the medical side of things, so that's nice. We'll see if I can settle on somebody."

So, I ordered a Might Mite P neck (although I'm thinking that maybe I should have gone with a Jazz neck, since that's what I'm more used to playing, and that might have been what I didn't like about the Epi neck) and am planning on doing the routing on it this weekend.

MaeBeWeird,BabyBumps,1390579283.0,"OKay so fundal height, what is it?

Well basically it's your doctor or midwife measuring from the tip of your pelvic mound to the top of your uterus. It should, theoretically equal in centimeters to how many weeks you are.

You see though, why this could be WAY off, right?

Because simple things could change the measurement. Indeed, how your bump looks could change the measurement. Or not, actually. What you see isn't necessarily what is being measured (they can feel up inside to find the top if necessary, they always did for me)

Baby pushing out can make you measure bigger. Baby not pushing out but being tucked up in can make you measure smaller. Funny enough, whether or not you've pooped recently can either push you out more or less and can possibly change your measurement. Of course, not by a lot, but eventually it can add up to a couple centimeters.

As well, having had a baby before can make your uterus get bigger faster (like when you blow up a balloon the first time its hard, then you deflate it, then you blow it up again it's a little easier), so women who have had previous pregnancies do tend to find they measure ahead.

Usually they say there's a 2 centimeter margin of error.

However, if you were already 2cm behind and you're now 3cm behind and your doctor/midwife isn't worried, I wouldn't be worried either. What they're mostly looking at is that next time, you're not 4cm behind. and then 5cm. That you continue to grow. 

And also that you're not for example at 33 weeks measuring 43! Because measuring way way far ahead may indicate other issues (like excessive amniotic fluid, also if you hadn't had an ultrasound it could mean twins)

Hopefully that answered your question... and anyone elses questions."

That is a terrible reason for supporting abortions. Just because someone has a large chance of living a hard life doesn't mean that we should let them be killed. It also assumes that a hard life is less preferable than no life at all. Not only that you are assuming that the mother and father are the only ones that can want a child. Even excluding adoption from the equation the kid will have friends, teachers, and other adults that might take on a parental role. There are tons of kids that were unwanted but found a loving and rewarding life elsewhere and went on to form loving lives on their own.

UglierThanMoe,gaming,1390580052.0,"*Dragon Age: Origins*. You can get the Ultimate Edition which includes all the DLC for around $20. It's a bit old (from 2009), but still easily one of the best RPGs ever, and not just for the Xbox.

Alternatively, if you like hack'n'slash, *Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning*. It's basically like a mix of Diablo and Fable (well, more or less), and actually a really good RPG. It had the bad luck of being released not long after Skyrim, and so it didn't get even only remotely the attention it deserves.

Speaking of Diablo-like, you also might want to take a look at *Torchlight*. It's an arcade game for the Xbox, and quite fun. It's not very long, but it has randomly generated dungeons and costs only around $15.

If you like something a bit more futuristic, I strongly suggest *Deus Ex: Human Revolution*. In fact, get DX:HR in any case, but take care to get the directors cut."

Many believe tracing bullets was never the real intent of the law in the first place."" paint one side of the story.

While I understand these quotes are supposedly from those opposing the law, without any mention of the proposed benefits, or input from the laws proponents, I can't make a clear and honest judgement.

It was a just-shy-of-grad level honors course. We critically examined so many works of science fiction, and so many types that are completely off the beaten path. But we did it as a way to look at society and humanity. We looked at how humans interact at technology. We asked what a soul is and argued what truly makes us human. It was an amazing class that made me question so much, and think in so many new ways."

/r/paleo is also a good resource if you just take everything not in the sense of ""I have to be 100% super strict grass-fed everything"" and just go with the basics. They have lots of recipes and meal ideas.

How do you feel about salads? I make a chicken-spinach salad for lunch a lot and it makes me feel amazing, and it's insanely filling. To prep, once a week I bake a few pounds of chicken breasts in the oven on a baking sheet covered in aluminum foil. I drizzle olive oil on them, and add a spoonful of jarred minced garlic, and a chopped onion, and salt and pepper. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes or until done, and shred. Tupperware that beast. OK, I pack my lunch to work in one tupperware. In the bottom, I put a small pool of balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I put cherry tomatoes down, chunks of bell pepper, then a handful of nuts, then a serving of chicken/onion. Add the baby spinach on top, put on the lid. Take it to work with an avocado. When it's lunch time, flip the salad over onto a plate, and top with the avocado. YUM. Salt+pepper before eating. Very easy, very simple, pretty cheap (cheaper if you leave out nuts, those bad boys are expensive).

Spaghetti. Instead of using Ragu or Prego or whatever, just buy a can of crushed tomato and add your own oregano, basil, salt, pepper, garlic. A pound or two of lean hamburger, cooked with onion and garlic, then lower the heat and add the crushed tomato and spices, simmer until it's warm, add a can of tomato paste if it's too runny. You can put that on sweet potato chili fries (easy, just google and find tons of ideas) or pasta, or make zucchini noodles (easy, but you'd have to buy a spiralizer or julienne peeler).

The Master also seemed to exercise some control when he regenerated from Professor Yana to Harold Saxon; it seems that the Doctor may just have less control, possibly because he never learnt proper procedure.

The Sixth Doctor was identical to Maxil as well; it's not only Twelfth that has looked like a person the Doctor has met before.

The Eleventh Doctor could well have been bluffing when he told the Cyber Planner he could regenerate. He didn't show the memory of the War Doctor, so in keeping with that, the Cyber Planner would have no reason to doubt him."

lorelei_,AskMen,1390581421.0,"&gt;I don't notice women checking me out. This is either because they're too subtle or I'm not observant enough. Probably both.

&gt;Women rarely make the first move, so it often seems as if there's a lack of interest from their part. You have to do all the work and often it feels like chasing something that doesn't want to be caught.

Both of these are very true, not just from the standpoint of how men see/feel about this - a lot of women are overly subtle when trying to flirt with men and a lot of them don't make the first move (some even downright refuse to do so). This tends to be because a lot of what women are told/taught about how to 'get' a man (in as much as it's something one acquires) tells them to be that way. Women's magazines and other forms of media spend an inordinate amount of time &amp; effort telling women that obvious flirting/making the first move will make men seem them as sluts. Hence why you get a *lot* of otherwise confident women who amp up the subtlety &amp; playing hard to get to ridiculous proportions.

Context: I should point out that I'm saying this as a woman who rarely conforms to the playing coy method of flirting with men and who has on numerous occasions been described as *very* forward because I have no qualms over approaching someone that I'm interested in directly (and who has also been bitched at for doing so rather than waiting for them to come to me). 

Also, I think that this part is a two-way street:

&gt;It takes experience to learn how to be rejected and many guys take a long time to get comfortable enough with this to put themselves out there enough for things to work.

Women also have to learn this, but tend not to bother because they assume that men will/should approach them. Getting rejected is tough for anyone, regardless of gender, but it's one of those things that becomes far less horrific over time. I think it would probably benefit men &amp; women everywhere to realise this - and to learn how not to take it personally (which is hard, but do-able).

LeBatEnRouge,explainlikeimfive,1390581481.0,"WOP = Slur against Italians and stood for ""Without papers"" meaning they came to the US illegally.

Kike = Slur against Jews that was born on Ellis Island when there were Jewish immigrants who were also illiterate signed their name with a circle. The Yiddish word for 'circle' is kikel (pronounced KY-kul), and for 'little circle,' kikeleh (pronounced KY-kul-uh). Before long the immigration inspectors were calling anyone who signed with an 'O' in place of an 'X' a kikel or kikeleh or kikee or, finally and succinctly, kike.

One that a lot of people don't know about is using the word ""gyp"" or ""jip"" as a slang for being cheated. As in, ""Paying $30 for a burger?! What a gyp!"" or ""I got jipped on that!"" Gyp is short for ""gypsy"" and it was a jab at them for being known as swindlers and cheats.

The original image/costume of the clown is also born of racial intolerance. Clowns have bright red hair and big red noses because they're supposed to be a parody of Irish people (red noses because they are heavy drinkers and associated with being drunk all the time).

The term ""Paddy Wagon"" is also racist. It was called the ""Paddy Wagon"" because people assumed it just trolled around town scooping up all of the drunk Irishmen who are loud and causing trouble in the streets.

Okay, so basically, my interview process was a little weird, as I was actually interviewing for an entirely different job at JC Penney, but my interviewer loved me and hooked me up with the Sephora manager the same day, and I got hired that day as well! It was awesome!!

So you've never had a legitimate interview before. Most retail interviews are the same, from my experience anyway. 

They mostly ask questions about:

* your hours
* availability
* past jobs
* what you do in your spare time
* why you're applying for the job with their company
* what you see yourself doing in 5, 10, 15 years (not everyone asks this)
* What experience or skills do you possess that would relate to the job

Talk yourself up, but don't sound cocky. If this is your first job, let them know. I didn't have any professional makeup experience when I applied, and it didn't matter. This job will help teach you skills you'll need to eventually build a portfolio for yourself if need be. (Also, gratis are amazing...so those help too!)

Umm some places ask you how much you want to be paid. Don't put minimum wage...put a dollar or so higher. Some places might give it to you depending on your character and skills. Don't settle for less than minimum and don't settle for less than you need or what you feel you're worth.

The interviewer will almost definitely ask you if you have any questions upon concluding the interview, so I suggest thinking of or writing down some questions you want to ask so that you remember. This shows the interviewer that you're not just there for a job, but that you are interested in employment *there* and you're serious about where it will take you, in terms of advancement, insurance, etc. 

Ask about insurance, definitely. When I worked there, it was SiJCP, so JCP had part time benefits available after 30 days. Some places make you wait 3 months to qualify for insurance, and some places don't offer benefits to part timers at all. Make sure you find out, because insurance is important.

Ummm I can't think of anything else right now but I'm sure I'm missing something....let me know if you have more questions! Sorry it took so long to respond!

For the OP here, download Ackis Recipe List - it will tell you the recipes you're missing and where to get them. Work on getting them all, make sure you do all 3 researches EVERY DAY until you run out of glyphs to learn from them. 

those 10-50g glyphs he's talking about - that makes my the bulk of my money. I'll gladly log in the next morning to multiple mail pages of auctions sold at 10-50g profit, I make plenty like this.

I definitely agree with the problem of storage - my problem right now is since I make/post on my main, I have to find space. That said, I don't make every glyph, on my server, I'm quite picky since it's high-pop so it gets undercut often to begin with, and supply is generally high. I set my ink prices manually, and set them a bit higher than they generally actually are (I think normally around 7g, though I've dropped them a bit recently, may be revisiting again as herb prices are going up a little). I only craft if I get 10g profit. This means I don't craft any glyphs that don't sell for less than 25ish gold. This keeps stock manageable, I also find it easiest to cancel and run back and forth a couple times to repost all my glyphs, then craft and post what I need. It means I can't restock as often, but I make plenty off it for now (though I just got one of my alts to the server that has a full bank of inscription bags and herb bags, so I might take advantage of this for a LOT more storage - have to look into setting up warehousing and mailing for TSM - shouldn't be too hard though)

Chris really wasn't sure what on Earth was going on; in hindsight, travelling 10,000 years into the future probably hadn't been the smartest choice, but how he was about to be condemned in court for... blasphemy, apparently, continued to elude him.

""I'll handle this,"" his cybernetic lawyer told him, rising up from his chair.

""Ladies, gentlemen, cyborgs and extraterrestrials of the jury,"" began the lawyer. ""It appears to me that what is being tried today is not my client, but the most fundamental of Earthian rights; the right to free speech. Does my client regret his actions? Of course-""

Actually, Chris didn't know what his actions had done at all.

""But if we condemn him today, we must then condemn ourselves for every negative thing ever spoken. Every snide comment, every vocal attack, every word caught upon our emotion. If we condemn my client here today, we condemn our rights themselves.""

""Does the prosecution have anything to say?"" inquired the judge.

""Your honor,"" began the Prosecutor - female, by what Chris could tell of her voice. Human? Possibly, although those wings were new to humanity's evolution. ""We live in a peaceful and free society, where beings from across the cosmos reside in harmony. For that harmony to remain, we have laws and conventions to ensure peace between all creatures. One instance where that peace failed is the event known as the Battle of Solan Coolistin.""

Chris was struggling to keep up - Battle of what *what?*

""Solan Coolistin was a battle between secular forces - human, cyborg, extra-terrestrial. We all fought - and died - for what was believed to be our individual rights. In our fury, we never considered what we actually were fighting for; nothing. The battle signalled our inability to communicate, the very worst the Cosmos has to offer. Despite the years and processes that have been created since this battle, we are forever reminded that Solan Coolisin is associated with the very worst of us all.

theczarman,CollegeBasketball,1390582216.0,"Just brought this up to another board I'm on, this was a response:

I don’t remember the name of the guy, but it was the direct predecessor of JTIII. My friend had a classmate at Fenwick who was huge, about 6 ft 8, 6 ft 11, something absurd. Last name Izzo. The problem was he was uncoordinated. No basketball talent whatsoever. Winter of senior year, he still hadn’t done college apps. But then he told a bunch of his HS buddies “be at such and such gym Thursday night”.

So they all show up, and the guy’s dad is there with a bunch of his cop buddies dressed as referees and boxes full of fake basketball uniforms. They proceeded to don the basketball uniforms and, through a series of takes, put together a highlight reel of young Mr. Izzo dominating people who weren’t worthy to be on a high school basketball team. They put the tape together and sent it to Georgetown’s coach. He heard back from said coach. “While I can’t offer you a scholarship, I can make certain you’ll get into school here as long as you walk on.”

And that is why there is a G-town Izzo jersey hanging in my friend’s apartment.

EDIT: Apparently was Kenny Izzo, who did play in High School, so the guy on this board may have left out some info and made this more embarrassing for Esch."

In the standalone there is absolutely *zero* reason to leave the coast because there is no difference between the loot you find there and the loot you'll find up north.  Even in the *vanilla* mod there was a huge difference.

After awkward encounters and even female rejection as a young adult, I decided to pay $2000 out of pocket to get an extremely painful and unnecessary surgery done, just to try to conform to this fucked up little cultural norm of ours.

I don't think you necessarily need blush for this look, but I will say that if you get the job, they make you wear it. You might be able to get by without it, but they're kinda strict about the ""full face"" rule during work, and if I didn't wear blush (or X, Y or Z), I would hear about it. 

There's a LOT of different colors available that look more natural without making your face super red. 

I suffer from acne bullshit all the time, so I get redness too, and believe me, I know all too well the, ""put foundation on to cancel redness, then add blush to put it back"" dilemma, but through playing with a bunch of techniques and different products, I kinda got the hang of it!

Is this a shirt that you want to wear all the time? How much will taking in the sides make it better? Would you have paid $50 for it if it fit perfectly?

My price limit for getting things altered varies wildly depending on the item of clothing. A cute cotton shirt that I'm wearing casually every so often- I'll probably try to fix it myself or wear it as is. A nice pencil skirt that will fit me wonderfully and be an excellent work piece- I'd be willing to spend quite a bit there. 

In my case, I'm far more willing to spend on tailoring for work clothes than for casual clothes, but how much you are willing to spend on an item - that cost includes tailoring - is based on what it's worth to you. I can't tell you how much to spend on a shirt because we value those shirts differently. That goes for total cost, whether it needs tailoring or not.

Ezada,dogs,1390583775.0,"Hello! Mother of a 4 month old here, I will let you know my experience with dogs and my baby. I had a 12yr old border collie/beagle mix (she passed right before christmas of a stroke) and a 6yr old pitbul lab mix. They have both been excellend with my son, but I think that its because they are older and not puppies. 

That being said, puppies can also be good because they will grow with the kid and you have a chance of them growing up used to a child being around.  Puppies can be excellent, and I plan on getting one when my son gets a little bit older. We need a bigger place, and I want him to be about 4-5 years old and know how to treat a puppy too.

Beagles can be excellent with children, but they can also be very high energy too, unless you adopt an older beagle. Puppies are nice, but with an older dog you know what you are getting, especially if you go with a dog from a reputable rescue/shelter. Most of them have their dogs evaluated for friendlyness with kids, other dogs etc. If you go to a shelter and they claim all of their dogs are sunshine and rainbows, I might look somewhere else, any shelter worth going to will tell you if their dogs have behavioral issues. 


I don't know anything about whippits though, so I am unfortunately no help there. 

As for other breeds that are kid friendly, Labradores, Pitbulls, Golden Retrievers, Boxers (though they are really really wiggly and have absolutely no concept of personal space lol) and random mixed breeds. 

I LOVE pitbulls, they are my favorite dog and my Pit Mix is excellent with my son. She wants to mother him constantly, its like she knows he is fragile. 

I Love labradores too! We had one growing up and she was such a sweetie. 

Never owned a golden, but hear nothing but good things from familys about them. 

Never rule out a dog because it is a mixed breed either. Some mixes can be stellar dogs :)

Hope that helps you a bit! "

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390583868.0,"Perhaps thinking critically about what the bible ACTUALLY says with regards to masturbation and porn might help you.

Masturbation is the sin of Onan after all.  Onan's brother died before he and his new wife could have kids.  Under Jewish custom at the time, it was the duty of the brother to marry the wife and then provide her with kids, since in those days marriage was not about love so much as uniting families, providing children, etc.  Onan felt resentful at having to marry his brother's widow, however, and was upset that any kids they'd have would be considered to belong to his deceased brother.  

So when having sex with his wife, Onan pulled out in an attempt not to get her pregnant.

THAT was the sin.  Disobeying a custom that was believed to have been a command from God.  I doubt YOUR religion believes that you must marry your brother's widow if he dies without issue, and I doubt that if you did, your religion would consider any kids you had to be your brothers.  So why are you believing that masturbation is a sin?  Masturbation isn't talked about in the bible at all. 

The porn thing would be harder to get around because Jesus taught you're not supposed to lust for women other than your wife.  But Jesus never said you can't wank.

I do support birth control, though I wish there was better male birth control outside vasectomy and condoms. The pill makes women pee out the excess hormones, and they are not filtered out of our water properly, causing environmental changes to wildlife, and some affect on people who drink the water. I recall reading about some sort of injection for males.

Since the act is legal, I support measures the reduce the demand for such procedures...

I do support adoption reform, there need more in nation adoptions, and it needs to be less expensive and less time consuming. In vitro and adoption shouldn't be so similary priced...

I support sex ed, though what I want is quite different from what both sides want. (Part of becoming a legal adult outside of voting and having age related priveleges should include a test regarding sex ed, that tests full knowledge a common adult should know on reproductive anatomy and physiology in very plain colloqioul terms, they should know exactly what the reproductive sex act is, what goes on in the entire pregnancy, exactly what birth is and what can go wrong, varying procedures of how doctor's deal with issues, full knowledge on STDs, what their symptoms are, how they are treated, varying forms of transmission, full knowledge of anything sexual that exists outside of heterosexual sex [legal and illegal], be taught legal definition of conesent, what sexual assualt is, how to report, how to deal, cost of children, etc. If parents don't want school to teach them, they can teach themselves, but the kid still needs to pass the test. )

If abortion was recrimnalized, ideally I would have really only actual punishment for the administrator of such an act, not the mothers. I don't trust prosecutors in this country to not prosecute women who miscarried because it would get them more votes. 

I also support research into why puberty is starting earlier, and would support attempts to stop what ever is causing it. 

I support better online higher education infrastructure so if a woman becomes a single mom, she still has a chance to be educated and socially mobile. 

I want the economy to be so damn good that a 15 year girl can have child with no father, be kicked out the house, and still be able to get a decent job t provide for the child, and have enough time to spend with the child., and still be able to get fully educated.

Justvotingupordown,AdviceAnimals,1390584254.0,"When you're in a significant position of power over another person, their consent is compromised.

In the case of teachers, they hold enormous sway over their student's lives (grades, recommendations, suspensions, etc). Adding to the pressure: The student is generally underage (or at most, 17 or 18, which is still early, brain-development wise.) With all that going on, it's extremely unlikely that the student could give valid consent. As you've expressed above, you're not talking about situations where there's a question of consent.

**But you say:** This imbalance is in a lot of adult sexual relationships too! What about a rich (adult) guy and a poor (adult) girl! Right, but those people are adults. They understand (hopefully) that they can say ""no"" if they are feeling coerced. (And even so, this is why lots of businesses forbid relationship between employees on different levels.)

**But you say:** What about the teacher-student relationships that are true expressions of love!? What about [Mary Kay Letourneau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kay_Letourneau)? That's not how we decide what's legal and not in this country. Just because some drunk drivers get home safe and sound doesn't mean we take away the restrictions on it.

**By the way:** (This is different from my original point.) What the teacher does in those situation is levels of magnitude grosser than what the student does. You then have to go back and question their every decision related to that student. Every grade, every approving comment. Were they planning it from the start? Have they done it before? Ugh."

I think that in general those things make men more attractive to most women BUT I also think it's terrible advice for guys with women who, like the OP's, just have zero interest in sex.  

Of course, the MMSL advice is to eventually divorce the wife who does not respond to the self improvement, and since the OP is adamant against doing that, I fail to see how MMSL will work for him.

bluesky747,MakeupAddiction,1390584370.0,"Haha YES YOU DO! I loved my uniform tunic! I think it looks like a Star Trek Deep Space Nine outfit and it makes me feel awesome. Also, whenever I'd hang out with dude friends after work, they'd say it was a pretty flattering outfit for one I *had* to wear. They're comfy too!

I think it's funny that you say there's too many yellow toned foundations cause when I look for ones for me, I only find red tones and I'm like ""uuugggg this is NOT what I neeeeed!"" I have more of a neutral skin tone, so it's not *quite* yellow but not quite pink either, so picking out foundation for myself sucks balls. 

The good thing is that with Sephora you can sample a LOT of stuff to find your match! I'd suggest getting three samples and going home and checking how foundations look in different lighting on your face....at home, outside...inside...the car...cause it's almost always different from how it looks under the store's florescent lighting.

Don't get too discouraged by all the colors and options and this and that. Immerse yourself in makeup. Live, sleep, eat, breathe, and shit makeup! Seriously. Because it will help TREMENDOUSLY with helping clients, and then it helps you in advancing your own skills and knowledge more.

When I first started there, I felt so useless when clients would ask me questions because I was just like ""uhhh.....sorry, I'm new....,"" but you'll get the hang of it soon enough. Look at the products, read the boxes, stalk MUA like I do and read product reviews. I can't tell you how many times I've had clients ask me about X, Y or Z product and I've given them information I learned here. 

Trying new products is also good. Take home samples of stuff. They encourage it so you can better sell their products. Clients *LOVE* to hear about *your* personal experience with a product. 

Also, remember that different people have different skin, so read up on skin types, like dry, oily, combo...some people have one undertone or the other, some like me aren't quite either. Oily skin, I'd recommend powder foundation or a mattifying CC cream or something. Dry skin would recommend moisturizing liquid foundations. Powder would just stick to the dry skin and make it look flakey and cakey. 

There's also A LOT of stuff to know about the skincare products, and basically you should really learn as much as you can about skincare, because one of the most important things I learned there was that if you don't pamper the FUCK out of the skin underneath your makeup, it might as well be a moot point to wear makeup at all, cause it doesn't look as good if your skin is jacked. 

So knowing what kind of skin they have, what issues they have with their skin, things they want to play up or hide, anything skin related basically is a stepping stone to finding the right foundation for a client (or yourself)!

Sorry for the long drawn out paragraphs....I keep thinking of things that might be relevant to you if you get the job lol. I just love talking about it. That job rules. Makeup rules!"

johnavel,Economics,1390584396.0,"I think this is definitely a problem in terms of pay scales and labor, but to me it's also a failing of who does and does not need to pursue higher education.

If we put more emphasis on STEM Education in HS and community college, a lot of people wouldn't need to go to a four-year college, and could save a considerable amount of money / avoid debt:

&gt;About 20% of all American jobs are now in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, with half of those open to workers who don't have a four-year college degree, according to a new analysis by the Brookings Institution.

&gt;Those jobs constitute a ""hidden STEM economy,"" because they are ""prevalent in every large metropolitan area,"" but many people believe at least a bachelor's degree is necessary to work in careers that require STEM skills. Many of these so-called ""blue-collar"" stem jobs are in construction, installation, manufacturing and health care. They include registered nurses, mechanics, carpenters and electricians.

&gt;""Of the $4.3 billion spent annually by the federal government on STEM education and training, only one-fifth goes towards supporting sub-bachelor's level training, while twice as much supports bachelor's or higher level-STEM careers,"" the report says. ""The vast majority of National Science Foundation spending ignores community colleges. In fact, STEM knowledge offers attractive wage and job opportunities to many workers with a post-secondary certificate or associate's degree.""

&gt;STEM jobs that don't require a four-year degree pay about $53,000 on average, about 10 percent higher than non-STEM jobs available to people with similar education backgrounds.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,Mommit,1390584419.0,"Letting them barge in while you're in the bathroom to avoid screaming only happens after they've shown you that they will scream at you every time if you don't. That can teach them to manipulate too - if they figure out that you give them what they want to avoid their tantrums, they'll exploit it. 

As for whether it's important or not, I guess that is a matter of perspective. I think it *is* important for mom to have privacy - when you have a toddler and a baby, and you're breastfeeding, and your day is taken up with the demands and needs of your children, having a small measure of privacy (a closed bathroom door, for example, and the ability to relieve yourself without someone staring at your crotch) is important so you can still feel like a person. I also think it's good for kids to learn that mommy has needs too, and that they need to respect her boundaries - that they don't get to walk all over her and override her need for something as basic as privacy with their demands. I always viewed not letting my toddlers in the bathroom with me as being on par with not letting them pull my glasses or earrings off, or hit/kick me when they're angry, or pull at my shirt or bra when they wanted to nurse: it was just a matter of respecting me and not treating me like I am their plaything.

If you went with just the points you mentioned...36% of the US would not be able to get healthcare since they are considered to be obese.  Even more Eat junk food.  Plenty of people smoke and many people enjoy a drink.  Most of the US would be out of luck.

Have you not ready any abortion statistics? As far as I am aware, [this](http://www.guttmacher.org/media/presskits/abortion-US/statsandfacts.html) is one of the best resources for accurate abortion stats. 

""In 2008, there were 6.4 million pregnancies to the 62 million women of reproductive age (15–44) in the United States. Sixty-six percent of these pregnancies resulted in live births and 19% in induced abortions.""

19% of pregnancies in 2008 ended in abortion. That's *often*.  Roughly 1 in 5 is a lot. If 19.5% of babies were born blind you'd probably feel that blindness happened often. When abortion was first made legal, it was done under the guise of being ""legal, safe, and rare"". It is legal and safe, but it sure as hell isn't rare anymore. Rare would be if it was reserved for extreme situations, like the health of the mother or fetus. "

chevelle1258,Cartalk,1390585347.0,"I just want to preface what i'm about to say with this. I don't know you. I don't know your driving style. So, whatever I say is based solely on past experience with other people who go through clutches really quickly.

It could be possible that something was wrong with clutch although so unlikely i haven't heard of it.

I haven't heard of any OEM clutch that has a normal wear time of 30k miles. That it extremely short. On reddit and in person I've heard of people doing 150k mi+ on the original clutch.

If you rest your foot on the clutch sometimes; stop that now. That is one of the quickest ways to blow through a clutch. If you really tried you could probably destroy it in less than a day. This causes unnecessary slip and can cause the clutch to glaze over as well as wear it down. The end result is very similar though.

Secondly, watch your RPMs when you leave from a stop. They shouldn't be 3 or 4k rpm. Even 2k every time is probably excessive. For the car to leave smoothly the rpm only need to be held about 400-500 RPM above idle (so about 1200-1300 rpm). If you keep it in that range while your letting the clutch out you should be good to go. Its more difficult on a hill because things need to happen faster or you will roll back, but its not impossible.

Thirdly, how you drive it makes a difference. If you are roughly shifting gears while you have the RPMs at near red line it will wear the clutch out faster especially if you start to give it more gas before the clutch is completely engaged. If you downshift and don't revmatch (blip the throttle a bit to get the RPMS up before letting out on the clutch) it can also cause the clutch to wear prematurely"

Giant__midget,AskReddit,1390585478.0,"Story time. A couple years ago, I got to go on a 2 day trip with some other engineers, salesman, and managers. The 2nd day a few of us went to eat at a nice restaurant. It happened to be the younger group of us, and we were all dressed really well at the time. Our waitress was very cute and very friendly, so naturally we started talking about her amongst ourselves. This was when there were still smoking sections, and I decided to pop over to burn one while we waited for our food. The waitress and another girl started to chat on the other side of a short wall and must have not known that I could hear them. What I heard shook me to the core and I will never forget it. The other girl asks the waitress how serious she is with some guy. Waitress says ""it's not going anywhere because you know my plan, I'm going to marry someone like one of those guys at my table. Then when I divorce him for his money I will go find my true love in my 30s."" They were not joking or laughing at all. She also said that was the only reason she was working at that restaurant.

schwann,taiwan,1390585523.0,"I think you partly answered your own question:

&gt;From my experience, people back home are more or less oblivious about TEFL.

If a company is oblivious to TEFL, then it's not a good signal to employers.

Think about it from a hiring perspective. As a hiring manager or recruiter, when I interview a bunch of random people for a position, I have two questions going through my head. 1) Does this person have the skills to do the job? 2) What is this person like?

If you've been doing TEFL for years, then you have already failed question 1. Teaching is a very specific skillset that isn't applicable to anything outside of teaching. TEFL even more so because the skillset evolves to account for communicating with people who don't have particularly good English skills. This doesn't mean the applicant is a good communicator; it just means he's adapted to communicating with people who don't use English as a first language. Add in the fact that I will have another applicant with some background in my field/industry, and the TEFL applicant pretty much gets tossed. 

There's no good way to gauge what a person is like through a resume and cover letter alone to answer the second question. The hiring manager is going to have to determine whether or not this person is worth speaking to despite not having any relevant experience. You can probably guess that the odds aren't in the TEFL applicant's favor.

Also, in every organization I have been part of thus far, there has been this unofficial scoreboard of who brings on who, and who refers who. If you do hiring interviews and you have a streak of sub-par hires, your judgement comes into doubt. As a hiring manager, you are trying to mitigate this risk."

What about the 59 yr old who was laid off because the company had to close it's doors.  No pension, no benefits.  They put in 40 years and are left with nothing.  Are they just another unemployed person?

What about a stay a home spouse?  They stay home to raise the children and take care of the home.  They have not worked in 15 years or more.  The spouse does not work at a job that has very good benefits and low limits.

Or the person who is employed, has benefits but the benefits limits are low and they can not afford more.  They run thorugh the total benefits very quickly.  Would you throw them to the curb?  Would you doom them and any family that relies on them to a life of poverty.

It's more like a tool they can use. Many people don't use it well as far as I see. It never ceases to amaze me how much focus people put into official education. It does not make the man.
In fact I remember meeting kids who studied 24 7. It seemed to me that they didn't have their own mind. Copy paste. They were good at listening but had a limited world view and bad social skills. This can be good in some jobs, but do you want to be like them? Laziness can protect you from doing things that don't matter to you for real. I'm sure someone is steaming right now to tell me how wrong I am. It's something society doesn't really like. But it helps me knowing that. And did you know it's typical of great minds to procrastinate? Da vinci to name one. Exhaustion is part of you and natural. Accepting that made me a lot stronger and stopped a pathological dislike for myself.
And why is your intelligence so average? Let me tell you I can program you anything but as soon as I touch a plant it dies. I am convinced there's different kinds and you just have to discover what you're good at and love. Again one of those society things in my opinion.

Keep the revs low when you start and when your driving keep them above about 1200 rpm or so (if varies slightly per gear but you can feel when the engine stops braking and starts acceleration. I usually keep it above that RPM)

Also another thing my GF use to do that just droves me crazy is pushing the clutch in every time she touches the brake. I hear thats illegal in the UK and will cause you to fail your drivers test in some countries and for good reason. If you do that it takes you longer to stop and perhaps even worse means that it will take longer for you to get your foot on the brake.

[Criminal Threatening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_threatening)

Criminal threatening is the crime of intentionally or knowingly putting another person in fear of imminent bodily injury. 

In most U.S. jurisdictions, the crime remains a misdemeanor **unless a deadly weapon is involved or actual violence is committed, in which case it is usually considered a felony.**

Criminal threatening can be the result of verbal threats of violence, physical conduct (such as hand gestures or raised fists), actual physical contact, or even simply the placing of an object or graffiti on the property of another person with the purpose of coercing or terrorizing.

The tracking info will say it's been delivered, even though it's actually being delivered the next day.  This is either a serious error with Prestige's tracking info, or Prestige is falsifying tracking info to make it appear to Amazon that they're fulfilling their end of the contract.

&gt; I have also learned that you have written an exposition of this whole system of astronomy, and have computed the planetary motions and set them down in tables, to the greatest admiration of all. Therefore with the utmost earnestness I entreat you, most learned sir, unless I inconvenience you, to communicate this discovery of yours to scholars, and at the earliest possible moment to send me your writings on the sphere of the universe together with the tables and whatever else you have that is relevant to this subject. 

Copernicus also had extensive communication with, and dedicated *De revolutionibus orbium coelestium* to Pope Paul III. This is Copernicus, who is practically responsible for modern heliocentrism.

Kepler was publishing as a practicing Lutheran *in the court of the Holy Roman Empire.* And he even wrote a treatise explicitly supporting Galileo's *Sidereus.* The Emperor Rudolph II was a very fond patron of Kepler, and his successor even kept him on the payroll despite some scandal in Kepler's own life.

**DO YOU READ WHAT YOU ARE TYPING.** Do you understand that you are justifying genocide? Whole-sale slaughter of literally millions of innocent children? Do you understand what a *totally fucked up system that is*, to kill people just for their Free Agency not being in the perfect little box that your malevolent ""God"" has set up?

&gt;The ones who did not want to follow God were the ones that perished.

Yes, yes. ""Follow me! Except you have Free Agency, you can choose not to! But if you don't, I'll fuck you up! *Thus Saith the Lord*."" Jesus fuck."

wrathfulgrapes,buildapc,1390587076.0,"Two part motherboard question:

- what's up with AMD micro ATX motherboards? There don't seem to be any that have good features. Some of them have USB 3, some have sata 3, but I can't seem to find any that have both. They seem to be limited in other ways as well... many limit ram speed to 1333, they aren't stable enough to overclock a lot, etc. Also, there isn't a single 990 mATX board on the market, that I can find.

Is there no demand for an enthusiast mATX amd board, or is there another reason?

- why the hell are PCI legacy slots still being put on motherboards? Especially on mATX boards, where you have precious few slots, why would they waste real estate on ancient, barely-usable legacy slots? Are they cheaper? "

I had family from there, and not a single of their WWII recollections agrees with what you just quoted. Whether applied to me or the author of that quote, remember that one Redditor's opinion/experience does not constitute a historical fact, and I suggest relying on a multitude of sources before concluding who's the knight in shining armor, who's ""literally worse than Hitler"", and who is stuck somewhere in between."

Constam,Planetside,1390587412.0,"Striker is kind of pointless right now. I still use it on occasion because shooting 5 rockets makes for a cooler light-show but compared to the Phoenix and Lancer its mechanic is just so bland. It needs a different mechanic than just being a lock-on that needs the lock maintained. I'd prefer something original but if SOE can't think of something new I guess shooting Coyote-like heatseekers would be an option. 

Vulcan could also use a buff. Now that Harrassers are so much weaker, getting them into the range where they're deadly is much harder so the nerf seems unnecessary now. 

I've never had a problem with TR carbines. With NC, buying the GD7F was one of the first things I did with my engineer, but I've never felt the need to upgrade from the Trac-5, it's a great starting weapon once it has a sight and laser on it.

Also never had a problem with Lockdown. People keep talking about HAs peeking around a corner and shooting rockets, but with Mercies or Pounders I'm able to kill them in the time it takes them to do that very easily. They might get a single rocket off, but if you have even one engineer one rocket isn't a problem. And when you have three or four engies... lockdown turns you into an unkillable death turret. MAXes are pointless without engineers in big battles anyway. 

Maybe a little more resistance to splash damage or a split second less time to turn it off would be nice but it doesn't need much. I think most people who complain about lockdown either don't have it fully certed or think that they should be able to stay locked down constantly without having to keep getting up to reposition."

I do think im right (obviously, its hard for someone to hold views they believe are wrong) and i have put my views up for public scrutiny, did you not read the comment you actually replied to?! When did I even say I'm an MRA? You're berating me as though I am one, I don't identify as one but it doesn't mean I can't defend them.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,feminisms,1390587964.0,"&gt;Whether it is a separate person or not is irrelevant.

I disagree - I think that is the most important part of the entire debate, given that the fetus is the one being aborted.

&gt;Sorry you mistook my speaking in abstracts as unscientific.

You weren't speaking in abstracts. You made an argument that was illogical. ""If a fetus was a human being we'd call a pregnant woman and her fetus conjoined twins"" is the level of discussion I'd expect from someone in middle school. It doesn't qualify as speaking in abstracts, and it sure as heck doesn't qualify as sound logic.

&gt;I thought that was the best route to take when making a point to someone who believes in fetal personhood. The idea of an ""unborn child"" is absolutely scientific, you're right.snicker

Who's talking about personhood? That is a legal construct (one that has a lousy track record, but that's another discussion altogether). I'm not talking about legal terms - I'm talking about physical things...what the embryo or fetus *physically is*. You make it seem like this is merely a matter of belief, as if believing one thing or the other changes the nature of a fetus. Feelings and opinions are irrelevant. I will refer you back to the [source](http://www.ehd.org/) I posted already, with a challenge: study the resources and see if you can find something that proves that an embryo or a fetus is anything other than a living human being. I've studied this topic for years, and when I found a website that was neither pro-life nor pro-choice (they are committed to remaining ethically neutral - the focus is on public education, prenatal research, and maternal/fetal health), what I learned was fascinating. I don't believe that things like feelings or religion should have a place in the discussion about abortion - only facts should be brought to the table. And I cannot overlook the fact that the unborn are alive."

As for the mer, fuck it - they're mer, you can just say they do. Unless someone in your world is an accomplished xenobiologist/xenobiochemist, none of your characters are educated enough to understand it anyway. You can make up all kinds of theories about how they do it and you don't have to decide on any one, that works great.

Imo, your best option is just to reduce it to advanced biology and then say, ""it's science!"" If there's not a strong difference between science and magic in your world, some people will think it's magic anyway. If you're got some kind of magic-origin in your magic system, you can pretty clearly distinguish between the two.

Having it be not-magic has certain consequences. Your mind-bending magic, if you have any, will affect the gestalt consciousness in a certain way, which *might* be different from a single consciousness, but will *definitely* be different than a magic consciousness like a golem might have. Or maybe not, if you've got a deep relationship between magic and consciousness.

In any event, the way to sell *anything* the boils down to ""it's science!"" / ""it's magic!"" is to be rigorous about applying it. Decide how you want it to work and then extrapolate some consequences that you have to live by forever after in your world. Just like in physics, it's not handwaving if it works, it's data-fitting."

En laglig abort i sverige sker innan fostret är vid metvetande. Detta går inte att kringgå. Det är bara en parasitformation som uppenbarligen inte är önskad. Ett önskat barn till en familj som kan hantera detta detta barn är värt alla aborter som sker i sverige under ett år.

Pipstydoo,changemyview,1390588464.0,"Words do not have any power and hardly any meaning outside of context.

Allow me to demonstrate and don't take this the wrong way:

""Fuck.""

""Fuck you.""

See the difference?  

The word ""fuck"" has no power to insult.  It *may* offend, but being offended is not anyone's problem but the party taking offense.  You have to *take* offense.  The idea of ""taking offense"" suggests that a person must actively summon the indignity required to even *be* offended, which in turn implies that person is just searching for a reason to be upset.

However, when the word ""fuck"" is given context what it means and the power it has can change.  When I say ""fuck you"" I'm creating a context in which I could be insulting you or cajoling you or even flippantly responding to some friendly ribbing, but *none* of these things can even be understood without even more context.  ""Fuck you"" in a conversational vacuum means nothing.  The same goes for any word.

The problem with censorship is that it grants a word or an image, or even a thought, de facto ""bad"" status.  It is now a taboo, and taboos are powerful things in a society.  Sometimes, taboos can even prohibit conversation, dialogue, and debate on a subject.  For example, child pornography or pedophilia or cannibalism, or gay marriage or abortion or racism.  The taboo nature of the censor is what grants the censored content an inherent power, not the content itself.

I agree with anyone who says that each individual has every right to choose what he or she listens to or watches.  Regulating that is as simple as turning the dial, flipping the channel.  In a family situation it's parenting, and accepting the fact that you'll never have ultimate control of what your kids do see and hear.  You can only educate them on the things they choose to consume.

Yet none of this, in my mind, justifies the use of a censor.  In fact, any kind of censorship opens the door to a slippery slope.  Who decides what should and shouldn't be censored?  Why do they have the say-so?  How do we make a system of censorship flexible enough to adapt with the times once it's institutionalized in law?  How do we criticize censorship without being targets of censorship ourselves?  Etc., etc."

Hey, if you don't want someone to snark at you, how about you don't be condescending and sarcastic to them in the first place? You don't get to be snotty at people and then try to put them in their place for responding to your tone. Get over yourself.

&gt;I made a logical leap, but hardly a big one.

It isn't logical to think that if someone doesn't support abortion they therefore want to totally ban it and control what other women do. I also find it very ironic when people accuse others of being ""morally superior"" whilst judging them by their own moral code and finding them wanting.

&gt;You'd talk a single person out of an abortion without knowing much about them,

Wait a minute, now you're telling me who I am and how I behave? But you don't know anything about me. Interesting that you're judging me because you think I would do precisely what you just did.

&gt;Look at your post history.

People come on Reddit asking people for advice. If you think that what I tell people *who ask for opinions* on Reddit is an indicator that I'm some kind of crazy person who waves signs with chopped-up babies in people's faces and devotes my time to lobbying the government, then yes, you've made a huge assumption.

Is she involved in charities or social groups, is she driven in the workplace even if she doesn't intend to have a lasting career, and is she driven in personal projects and goals. I would then translate this drive over to the idea of motherhood by how she acts around kids, how caring she is to me, and all those other traits that make a good mother good. 

Most of this comes from my desire to run my own company someday and wanting to have a SO that can not only be a great with my future children but one that will understand my drive in the workplace as well. I have seen how this works with my parents where my father is really goal driven taking the family business from 100 employees to 200 employees and my mom having enough drive to not only be a full time mother for me and my brothers but also a full time person with all of her own goals. I want a SO that will not only be great to be with when we have kids but also great to be around when they get old and move on. I am looking for a well rounded but motivated individual that has traits that good mothers have.

My bus stop was about a block north of where I live - 5 min walk. It took at least 20 mins to get there and I slipped a couple times which was no fun.

It's dealt as a joke for the unrated version of Sex Drive, but I want to say the directors used full frontal nudity as a sort of commentary of extra nude scenes of women in unrated versions.

&gt;so what does that say about female nudity?

Since the sexuality of men and women is treated differently in society, I don't think you could necessarily draw the same conclusion with all nude women.  Although, there are points where nakedness is tied with ""weakness"" or a lowest point.

Certainly, it's been used by a character as a ""weapon"" or for an advantage, not that that is necessarily good either."

wrathfulgrapes,buildapc,1390589175.0,"It's a huge mess that takes some getting used to. Here are some basics that I've learned...

Nvidia uses 3 digit numbers, the first number is the generation and the second and third are indicative of where the card falls within that generation. So a 760 is newer than a 660 but about the same age as a 770 and a 780. They also have ""souped up cards which are better somehow (not really sure how, they just squeeze more juice out of them). These are called Ti cards. So a 560 Ti is better than a normal 560.

AMD used (until very recently) four digit numbers, with the first two numbers designating the generation and the last two designating where the card falls within that generation (kinda like nvidia but with four numbers instead of three). So a 7770 is older than a 7870 and about as old as a 7750. They also have special cards called GHz editions, which are already overclocked and run slightly faster than standard cards.

Recently, AMD released its newest cards, and they totally changed the naming. Now they use two separate names. First is an R followed by a 7 or a 9. R7 cards are cheaper, consumer grade cards. R9 cards are the higher-performance cards geared towards gamers/enthusiasts.

After the R number there is a three digit designation (270, 280, 290, etc). I'm not sure what the individual numbers mean, but the higher the number, the better the card. Each card has an ""x"" version (270x, 280x, etc.) which are better than the non-x version but not as good as the next card up. So 270&lt;270x&lt;280. I'm actually not sure if *every* card has an x version, but you get the idea.

Those are the basics, but there are a couple of things that make this even more confusing (as if it weren't confusing enough already). 

First, both companies reuse cards for ""new"" generations. For example, the nvidia 760 is pretty much the exact same card as the 670. They threw a new badge on it and rereleased it, just a tier lower than it had been. Same thing happened with the 270x... it's the same thing as a 7870ghz, AMD just slapped a new name on it. So that can get kinda confusing, because two cards that have different names (and sometimes different costs) can be virtually the same card.

Second, the better cards from previous generations can far outperform cards from more recent generations. This means you cannot base the ""goodness"" of a card off its number alone. For example, a 6990 is better than a 7870. It's older, but higher performance.

So that's what I know about nomenclature, I've pieced this together over the past year and I've never really seen a complete guide, so some (or all) of it might be wrong, but I think it's a decent place to start.

That's a lot more than calling up GoDaddy a couple times a month. There are many technical hurdles to jump through with them that are less than efficient compared to other hosts I've worked with, which means more for me to charge for, and more for GoDaddy to charge for as well.

I prefer Dreamhost, Hard Hat Hosting, Bluehost and Amazon. Haven't used Rackspace but they look good as well. GoDaddy though, they're amateurs. Early on one of my clients was using them. I knew one of the tech trainers at the time, as I live in AZ. I consulted with him regarding email issues my client was having. He blamed it in her Mac and said Macs suck. Two days later I discovered their email plan didn't offer IMAP services, an email service they were paying for. My host at the time (Dreamhost) always included IMAP for free included with hosting. It had nothing to do with her Mac. GoDaddy wasn't up front in detailing this and other restrictions, and there were plenty more. I had to dig quite a bit.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1390589518.0,"&gt;it was based on ones right to decide for themselves on what happens to their body.

I understand that. However, there are actually two bodies involved in an abortion - the woman's, and the fetus'. If it only affected the woman's body, I'd be all for it. Go for it! But that isn't the case. Which is why I feel strongly about it, and why I think it's an important social issue. 

&gt;That would say that we should work on education more than trying to prohibit abortion.

Completely agree. I don't understand people who are vehemently against abortion but also against sex ed in schools, or use of birth control, or social welfare programs that make it possible for young moms or poor moms to keep their babies. It's beyond stupid. You can't have one without the other! And I also agree that banning it doesn't help. Abortions will still happen. And there are situations in which it is absolutely necessary to save the mother's life...I would never support making these women die, losing both lives when one life can be spared. Banning it's a mistake. If you want to reduce it you have to address the root causes instead. 

Actually, what's cool about what you said is that it's really true - abortion statistics from places where sex ed is comprehensive and normal in schools are different than they are in, say, the Bible Belt. Fewer abortions - and also fewer things like STDs - happen, and it's a direct result of educating people. It is a must. "

Given what I know about natural selection and evolution, I have no reason to believe that alien species will work in a way that's comprehensible to us on first glance. What does the psychic communication lobe of a brain look like? We don't know, we don't have one. Hell, what would a merman's brain look like? Could look like anything.

If you have your own limits set on biology *that you are rigorously applying,* then you should mention them. If you don't, do some data-fitting so to speak. Figure out the rules of these hiveminds. In real life, this is how we construct our understanding of things, to test them and see what happens. How do we know how the brain works? Brain scans during focused activities. Turns out our brains consistently light up for some stuff in some places. If you gave the most brilliant neuroscientists a few trillion neurons and a billion years, the likelihood that they could reconstruct a human brain is basically zero due to its complexity.

So, if I were you, I'd putter right on to rules. It's biological, it can do x, can't do y, and z affects it in this way or that way. Then you'll have a better understanding of how it works. Maybe it's involuntary - it might not be part of the brain, might be central nervous system. Unless it's explicitly verbal or explicitly visual, then it's brain. But then how do people without words understand it? Or the blind? What kind of vocabulary does it have from where? Can it play dreamscapes to the confusion of everyone? Is it centralized or some kind of field with locals communicating in it?

These questions, the rules, tell us more about it than anything else."

Why is that such a terrible thing? Full-time daycare is at least double that and you have to pack for and transport your child daily as well as making ""emergency arrangements"" when your child inevitably gets sick from being exposed to so many other little germ-factories. 

Having in-home care for your child is a great advantage the first few years. Not to mention that your child is bonding with his/her grandmother all that time. Nothing will ever replace that connection.

I'm a caregiver for an 8-month-old and my employers pay me $2,800/month. I'm sure many parents would kill to pay only $500/month for child care."

Your game is a happy-go-lucky tralala of harvesting resources and building a pellmell base and then wondering what went wrong when you get raided.  Let me fill you in.

Other people playing this game are hardcore as fuck and will destroy everything and everyone they can in an effort to grow their resource piles.

Now, you don't have to change the way you play, but you need to change the way you think.  You need to account for these people.  You need to *hide* yourselves and your movements until you get established.  Most importantly, you need to hide your base better than anything else.  Kill anyone who comes around near it.  Destroy any buildings you can around it.  You need to protect the location of your base more than any of your resources.

You need to stow your grandiose imagination until you get a solid, utilitarian base.  Then grow your dreams.  Once you are established, taking a loss (death) won't be such a big deal.  You will be more relaxed.  The game will be more fun.

What you should be focusing on is the lesson that *single* bandit taught you.  It was *one* guy.  Yet, your building was so poorly planned in construction and so poorly made that you couldn't even hold it against some dude with a supply of wood and a weapon.  You couldn't defend yourself because you had no weapon and because your base was worthless in terms of preventing home invasion.

The Licensing and Certification are not issues when comparing the countries.  They all have very similar standards, you can practice in any of them without needing to be recertified.

Quality:  Again no differences at all.  Canada and US import and export the same items.  The products used during an operation in Canada or the US could have come from the exact same sourse.

Legal Issues: Nope...no issues with being able to sue for malpractice between the countries.  There would be no more differences between the countries then you have between different states or provinces.

Ethical Issues:  When comapring US to Canada, UK, France...there are no more ethical issues then any other country when comparing similar economies.  Overseas like in China and India there are chances at this.

Follow up Care:  yes trying to get follow up care done in another country can be an issue.  This is not unique to any country.

ThanksForAllTheCats,AskWomenOver30,1390590556.0,"As someone else said, looks and money are by *far* less important when you're in your 40s. Personality is much more important. And you may not have a statistically accurate sample there, either. 

Also, many women find that when they reach their 40s, they have become more confident and independent, and feel the need to live life on their own terms. They may feel that their relationship is holding them back; that the man has not matured, and is happy with the status quo, while they're finding empowerment and looking for new adventures, while he's content to keep things as they've always been. Also, the kids may have left the home or are at least able to function on their own, removing one of the factors that kept the couple together in the first place. 

Finally, in my experience, women divorcing at that age may not at all be interested in finding a new mate. They are often quite able to support themselves, and don't want the hassle of dating. Their lives are complete without a husband. Social activities and female friends fill any void left when a marriage has ended.

yomammaspoodle,formula1,1390590997.0,"I think it's a self fulfilling prophecy. Let's assume that they do make good engines and they also want to sell them at a reasonable price, so the smaller teams are able to buy them. Those smaller, new teams have bad chasis, inexperienced drivers and small development budgets which keeps them at the back of the grid. It's hard for bigger teams to know if it's the engine that's bad or the chasis of that small team is just atrocious, they likely assume both. 

Pair that with the fact that when the v8's were introduced in 2006 they had one of the most powerful, highest reving engines but one that was incredibly unreliable. That set the precedent with williams in 2006 when they were in good points scoring positions and the engine blew. From then on, only teams like Marussia and Caterham still used the engines.

Silly_little_pet,bdsm,1390591051.0,"I am not clear on exactly how much can be automated in a subreddit. The perfect solution, in my eyes, would be an automated system that either required a ratio of ""above-0 comments to subreddit submissions"" above a certain threshold, or limited accounts to 1 submission per X hours. I think I'd personally prefer 1 post per 24 hours, but the number could be a lot smaller and still go a long way towards quelling the spam.

If that sort of control isn't available then I'd say the second best solution would be an consistently enforced rule of at least X hours (10 hours would be easy to spot and should give ample freedom) between submissions. This one is second because it requires users to report thread and mods to remove them and/or ban users. Lot more work.

If, for whatever reasons, none of the above are possible then self-post only would be the last way to solve it. It's not optimal for a media-focused subreddit but, at least in my opinion, it is still better than spam-accounts running rampant and shoving all other content off the first page.

I don't really see a problem as far as different scenes/models go. If the poster really wants to get them all out there ASAP, then they can be lumped into a selfpost as many different albums. Otherwise (s)he can just wait a while to post the next album.

In all this I operate under the assumption that the subreddit should cater to private users that want to share original content or larger collections of stuff scrounged from around the web. This sort of approach would obviously not be very well suited for people using the subreddit to advertise their paysite or for people trying to amass karma and/or attention for whatever reason."

&gt;If a 59yr old is laid off and has NO SAVINGS?! They made their own disaster. They better find a job quickly.

And how do you know thier situation?  You don't.  Maybe they had to support a spouse at home and raise two children on 1 income?  Maybe they had a huge medical expense for a child years ago and did everything they could to pay for it?  But according to you children are unemployed and shouldn't be covered because they don't pay taxes.  You do not know some one elses situation or what led them to be where they are.  There are a lot of reason why some one might not have any savings.

&gt;You wouldn't believe how often I hear about people that ""can't afford insurance"" but they have cable tv, a smartphone, newer car, smoke, buy drugs, etc...

So a few individuals out of how many americans?  Millions?  Your personal sphere of people is not an indication of the population at large.  Just because friends/family and others you know are not responsible with thier money does not mean everyone who can not afford insurance is.

&gt;I  think bankruptcy IS a great option for absolving medical debt.

Give your head a really good shake!  In what world is losing everything a great option?  Do you even know what you go through to declare bankruptcy?  It is the last option.  Before you end up declaring bankruptcy you already have put a 2nd mortgage on your property(if you have it), a lein on you car, max out your credit cards, drain your bank accounts....you are financially destroyed!  You will not be able to get any credit and what you can get the interest rates are freakishly high.  It takes years to try to back to a position where you can start to rebuild your life financially.  How dare that person want to get well and contribute to society again.


&gt;You ask if they should lose everything over an illness.... yes is the answer I have. It's not right to demand that everyone else pay for their illness for them.

Why should healthcare be any different then all the other services you enjoy at other peoples expense?  I presume you like having police service, Fire department coverage, public schools, roads, health inspectors, and numerous other services provided by tax dollars.  According to your line of reasoning if people don't use these services they should not pay for them right?

I hope you, your family, your friends never get sick and have to experience that which you would condemn others to experience.

Some airlines give you 1 free checked bag so that would be worth $25 or whatever it is now so calculate all of those little savings in using last year as an example.

1. Are the miners involved anyhow? During Arab Spring, I read that workers in the resource extraction industries usually side with the regime (they were bussed into Cairo to destroy the city and hurt the anti-regime people). Is that the case in Ukraine as well?  

2. Are football ultras doing anything, and if yes, what are there allegiances? Haven't read or seen anything about them, but, they're usually involved in events like this. During Arab spring, there were pro and anti-regime clubs, with pro-regime usually from resource extraction towns (interesting case study would be difference between Metallurh Donetsk and Shaktar ultras).

In the ancient Middle East, rape pretty much guaranteed that a woman was no longer eligible for marriage because she was ""defiled.""

Changing mores. Education. Litigation perhaps.

&gt;Me personally, I don't think insurance should cover the little stuff. Health care would be a lot cheaper if the MIDDLEMAN didn't need to get paid every time something happens.

This is where we agree cut out the middle man!  Universal Healthcare as done in many other countries is by far the biggest dollar value you can get in healthcare.  Procedure A will cost this much in this State no matter where you go would be much better then the hodge podge system in place.

Covering the little stuff is a good thing though.  Little things can lead to bigger problems down the road.  Prevetative medicine is preferrable and more cost effective.

scooper1030,nba,1390592909.0,"I'm a little late, but the 2000s were not good for drafting in Phoenix. Not because we sucked at drafting, but because we traded everyone away. 

In 2006, the Suns draft a prospect by the name of Rajon Rondo. They trade Rondo and Briant Grant to the Boston Celtics for a 2007 first-round pick.

Alright, now fast forward to 2007. With the pick they acquired from Boston, the Suns draft Rudy Fernandez. But do they even keep him? Nope, instead they trade him and James Jones to the Blazers for cash. 

We also traded Luol Deng to the Bulls for Jackson Vroman and a future pick on draft night, and we traded Gortat to the Magic for cash. 

Oh yeah, and then there was the time that in order to clear cap, we traded Kurt Thomas, a 2008 first-round pick that became Serge Ibaka and a 2010 first-round pick that became Quincy Pondexter to Seattle for a 2009 second-round pick (a European player who never played a game).

If you aren't willing to see perspective in a course that has curriculum meant for unbiased exploration of a subject, you really should avoid those sorts of classes. Rather than taking the class to grumble and bring down the atmosphere for others. "

TheeLinker,mylittlepony,1390593186.0,"[](/twismile) No one's more surprised than me that these things have gotten the attention that they have. I thought they'd be good for nothing more than a little bit a of a laugh from /r/mylittlepony denizens seeing the emotes they know so well move around and stuff. I didn't think they'd be accessible at all to anyone outside the community.

I don't mean to go 'defending' myself -- it's absolutely fine that you don't like them and I'd actually welcome more dissenting opinions -- but I thought as point of interest I'd mention that from *my* point of view, these are approximately 20% about the animation and 80% about the writing. Like, I work hard at the animation and do my best to convey what I need to convey through them, but ultimately, they're animated to give people a reason to read the silly jokes and dialogue exchanges I've loved to write since I was in the first grade. This is just the first visual medium I've found fun enough to actually work at regularly. I'm a screenwriter at heart, I guess, when it comes down to it.

[](/twibeam) The writing may not be your cup of tea (or at least, not enough to make up for bobbing heads), and that's more than okay. I'm happy to hear what you have to say on the matter! I just wanted to convey that you're totally right that the technical quality of the animation is nothing compared to actual, real, character animation -- all it's there for is for facilitation of the main focus. It's like sketch comedy more than it is a real animation. Or something like that."

s1295,depression,1390593254.0,"&gt;Why did you get diagnosed?

Life had become unbearable and I wanted some way out (other than suicide…), therapy, medication, whatever.

&gt;How is the process like?

Saw my regular doctor and described how I felt, got a preliminary diagnosis and a referal to a psychiatrist. Went there and after a surprisingly short conversation (10 min or so) I had the official diagnosis (F33.1 Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode moderate) and a prescription (the usual reuptake inhibitors).

&gt;What further actions did you take post-diagnosis?

I took the medication, had follow-up visits with my psychiatrist, switched medication due to a lack of effect, rinse, repeat × 3. Unfortunately, medication isn’t doing a thing for me — at least not the usual stuff.

Since things were still going south and I was getting pretty fucking desperate, I sought in-patient treatment, i.e., hospitalization in the psych ward, where I stayed for 9 weeks. (It was an “open” ward and less restrictive than one might think.)

Now I’m in a partial in-patient program, i.e., I attend therapy on weekdays but live at home.

&gt;Has a firm diagnosis on your mental issues helped or hindered in anyway?

Well, sure, since it’s a prerequisite for (or byproduct of) treatment. I still have doubts, as in “It’s all your fault.” etc., that is, I still question the legitimacy of my mental state despite having a “firm” diagnosis.

Ask away if you have any questions."

Depending on how long this weather lasts, I may spring for a set of mittens (over the liners) since you really only need the thumbs for operation.

For those that don't know, because a diesel relies on compression alone to auto ignite the fuel, the whole mass needs to get to a minimum temp for it to be able to start. so when the block is literally frozen, and the fuel is just as cold, as soon as it starts to compress the mixture, the heat isn't there, and there is no start. this is why they have glow plugs, to heat the pistons to allow it to start, however they get neglected in warmer areas, so they don't work and people don't know how to use them, hence the trouble.  
on top of that, diesel fuel gels in cold weather unless treated. think of coconut oil. it just won't flow. if they didn't treat the fuel tanks, and winterize everything in those temps, there will be issues.

First of all, 4 of those 6 losses came during a five-game Eastern road trip that spanned over 7 days. Five away games in seven days (while experiencing subzero temperatures in Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis) would be hell for any team.

Also, of those 6 losses, only one was by a difference of more than 5 points (99-91 vs. Memphis). In fact, although the Suns have a losing record in their last 11 games, they've also outscored their opponents by 37 points over that time period.

Losing Bledsoe was huge, but I really don't think we'll just fall out so easily. We added Barbosa, who is playing well. Alex Len is finally healthy and can contribute. And if Emeka Okafor and Bledsoe can return near the end of the season, we'll be more dangerous than we ever were. "

Daiteach,bloodbowl,1390594322.0,"My big concern would definitely be that, moreso than even a lot of games that might have a technically similar amount of RNG, Blood Bowl feels like it produces quite a few situations where either it's clear to even a casual observer (and perhaps *especially* to a casual observer, who is more likely to evaluate things on a play-by-play basis) that big swings are coming down to a single roll - either cases where scoring clearly hinges on succeeding on a dodge/block/pass/GFI or cases where the game feels like it's handicapping one of the players independent of either of their decisions, as with certain kickoff events.

One the flipside, ""storylines"" that keep viewers coming back are sort of the holy grail of eSports, and Blood Bowl does those really well, I think, if you actually run things as a league.

The other concern I have is that while Blood Bowl's intentional stratification of teams into ones that are more straightforwardly powerful and ones that are intentionally weaker and more challenging to succeed with feels like kind of sketchy optics. When you're putting rewards on the line and pushing the metagame to tighten up, my concern is that you'd see a relatively narrow band of teams, with most of the the others getting sidelined most of the time."

Kids are generally at shows to have a good time and sometimes they'll be a little overzealous but they're never violent or vindictive the way ""adults"" are at concert halls or outdoor festivals after a few too many drinks.

I've stopped going to bigger shows because of this. If it says on the flyer whether or not its AA or 19+ (Canadian drinking age), I'll opt for the basement show happening where I know people aren't going to be assholes regardless of age."

keypuncher,AdviceAnimals,1390594729.0,"&gt; Will they learn to speak English?

They might learn to speak some English.  They'll be at a serious disadvantage in the labor market due to lack of English skills and education, which will relegate them to the same unskilled labor positions they occupy now.

Because they have no upward mobility, they will be preferred hires for companies with unskilled labor positions, since they will likely stay in the job forever, reducing turnover costs.

This will increase unemployment and reduce wages for unskilled and low-skilled American workers.

In addition, because there will always be a market for labor at illegally-low wages, many of their current employers will simply replace them with new illegal aliens.

Liberals will decry the plight of the poor, amnestied, illegals, and go on at length about how Republicans hate the poor, until the amnestied illegals become eligible for the welfare system (many are already on Food Stamps even though they are technically not eligible).

&gt; Will they become citizens?

Eventually yes, if for no other reason than to gain full access to our welfare state - which is another problem.

Medicare and Social Security are currently going broke even though the average income of American workers (which the payroll taxes that support those programs are a percentage of) is three times the minimum wage.

Even if those programs were just breaking even now and going forward (which they aren't even close to), it would take the contributions of three amnestied illegals to pay for the SS and Medicare benefits of one worker - leaving the benefits of the other two to be paid for by current American citizens.

Amnesty is a bad deal for everyone who is currently an American citizen - unless they're a Democrat politician, who 2/3 to 3/4 of these new citizens will vote for, or one of the big businesses that will benefit from the new crop of low-wage labor."

I also had a bunch of new tough scar tissue that made it impossible to stimulate the area at all. I couldn't even cum from masturbating. You ever gone two months without getting the venom out of the snake? I can assure you it's not fun, and by the way, blue balls is a real thing and it hurts like hell. I also found that when I put on a condom it was so desensitized that I couldn't even stay hard. The physical problems ruined my sex life and led to depression, not the other way around, as you seem to be insinuating. I had to wait for my scar tissue to heal and then retrain my body to be able to orgasm. It's still not easy but I'm getting better at it, thank God. By the way, I did see your other ignorant condescending comment, that you deleted, about how I was insecure and should've manned up or something before the surgery. So, I should've manned up and just raped those girls who were weirded out by my foreskin? Is that what a real secure man like you would do?

My mom got fitted at Dillard's and loved it, so I decided to stop in and see the fitter there. First bras she brings me are 30Es... I was like LOL NO LADY THESE AREN'T GONNA WORK.

GhostsofDogma,TheBluePill,1390595398.0,"Oftentimes it's an intense feeling of entitlement to a very warped idea of respect. My Dad's a good guy, I'd NEVER say he was even close to being a redpiller, but he does have anger issues and on bad days is very easily enraged by things he's been taught are disrespectful to his position as the man of the house. I could easily imagine this being taken to extremes by someone that's a complete cunt. 

It's an extremely old-fashioned way of thinking and generally if the father is abusive, it's no longer just a custom that's passed down- it's something that the child feels intensely entitled to once he is the man of the house because he feels it is 'owed' to him as recompense for the shit he had to go through. It's 'okay' that his father put him through shit because he'll get to be on top someday. (These people can find it very difficult to admit their fathers were wrong.) It's less his sense of self that is being damaged when someone speaks up to him and more his understanding of the world. The world can be a very scary place when you believe it to be unfair and hostile, so people build these weird barriers against that feeling, and it's why the anger is so explosively nonsensical and inhuman.

Don't think I'm defending it, though. There are a thousand ways you can deal with abuse and difficulty, and who you are determines whether you take the high road or the cuntiest way out. Abused or not, you still consciously make the decision on whether to step on people or not on your way out."

Therefore, there is no salvation. If that god chooses to condemn a person for a string of events over which they have no control, because it is all already known, in its entirety, to that god, then that is one evil sonovabitch who is in this for the torture.

Beyond that, I give commendations to who I enjoy playing with the most, which can't be as easily defined.  There are some people who are average skill-wise but are funny and friendly, and some people who stay silent but wow me with their skill level.

duggtodeath,badhistory,1390595750.0,"&gt; Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

That is a poor argument. You are invoking a logical fallacy: argument from ignorance. That claims the truth of a premise is based on the fact that it has not been proven false, or that a premise is false because it has not been proven true. The very *lack* of evidence is thus treated *as* evidence. I guess in your eyes the absence of smoke proves that the fire is very carefully hidden. That is a tired apologist argument.

&gt; You can no more disprove the divinity of Christ than any Christian can prove it. That's why it's called faith.

That is also a poor argument. I was not the one making the claim for magic. The person who makes that claim bears the burden of proof. Again, a tired apologist argument.

&gt; That's why it's called faith.

And that's why history works on facts, not faith. Faith is accepting bad history. You cannot both defend truth in history while also promoting a faith which denies historical truths. A man we attribute to Jesus existed. There is no historical evidence that he (or anyone) performed any magical miracles. Fact. End of story."

Awkward_moments,AskReddit,1390596056.0,"Some backstory that I never really care about. Some men are away hunting, their town gets pillaged. Everyone dead massacre kind of thing.

So someone decides to go to the temple and prays to the Gods for vengeance. The Greek gods, enjoying a bit of war and little arguments decide to help. So the warrior is blessed by a God as a hero.

So anyway the game play involves you playing as a hero and a leader. After the AI difficulty is set. Strategy dictates how difficult the battle will be for you and your men. So if you have a good strategy and you play well, you save a lot of your own men and kill a lot of the others.

Then you decide where to move to next and what to do. So your ability to play as a hero and strategy determines if you win or not. 

If you lose a war it puts you in a difficult spot.

There needs to be some complicated save system where you can go back, and a bit of cheating if you made some huge mistake but your an hour in and want to finish these guys off before you restart and win for real. It needs to be variable, randomise a few things then have algorithms for difficulty of opponents. Maybe you can gain allies and then play as footsoldiers, and great fighters. Just different feel to the game depending who you play as. Unarmoured men doomed to die. Well drilled, heavy, solid soldiers who have high health. The hero, the warrior dealing out huge damage, yet still mortal.

I want to play as a main character where I feel for the men. They look at you and see hope. They put to much faith in you, then you know ever second you dont kill the boss, your men are dying. You see them storming walls dying in there hundreds all because you told them to, they keep moving in anticipation for there great leader to come in and save them.

Had enough of games where all that matters is if the main character survives."

Like last week, he said he'd clean the kitchen and when I got home, the easy stuff was done and the annoying stuff was still all over the place. Rather than take the time to have a Discussion about it and deal with the resulting negative stuff, I cleaned it up and then put his gross towel back on the rack. I had the mild annoyance of cleaning up the hard half of the kitchen and he experienced the mild annoyance of a gross towel. The issue is now over for me and he knows that he probably did something stupid and now we're square. We both go on with our happy marriage until I forget to put a new pack of Diet Coke in the fridge and he retaliates by not putting a liner in the trash can or squeezing the toothpaste from the middle. It's stupid shit that keeps us from arguing over stupid shit so we can focus on the important shit. "

Dropping 4.5lbs in 2 weeks is a little bit fast, but if you feel good you should be fine. For weight loss, the goal is usually to have a deficit of 500 calories a day, which works out to 1lb/week.

Fat loss will occur everywhere on your body, but yes, most of it should come off places like your gut. If you lose anything in your boobs, it will be fat and not breast tissue, and it will just make them look perkier."

&gt;Drunkenness is wrong for precisely the reason that self-indulgent pleasure is an immoral alternative to joy from God.

This is a false dichotomy.  We don't have to choose between moderate drinking and spiritual joy.  If drinking becomes self-indulgent, then it is not moderate or responsible, and it becomes a different moral matter entirely.

&gt;The Bible is not ambiguous about drunkenness, either in its social impacts or individual morality.

racistsfuckoff,australia,1390596676.0,"I think you have a distorted view of the police. They're not there to help people. From the very beginning of the modern police force they haven't been. The modern police first were created in Britain with the purpose of breaking strikes and public protest. In Australia this was replicated, but initially with the primary function of beating starving convicts who tried to get more rations. 

Look at today - most crimes go unsolved. Even when the police deign to investigate a crime, they rarely provide a solution. Most police do not spend their day investigating crime, they spend it walking the streets or sitting in a car. However, when there's a strike like the Grocon strike the other year, thousands of police mobilise to attack the workers. Police mobilise to attack the community who are protesting that horrid tollway in Victoria. You never see this kind of mobilisation for workplace abuse or corporate crime, it's exclusively for crushing dissent. 

The police as an organisation have never existed to help people, with the exception of property owning people who need to stop workers from striking or the community from protesting. This isn't a noble cause, it's a repressive, violent one. If someone spends any significant period of time around the police or within it, and they don't figure this out, they're pretty stupid. If they don't leave, they're supportive of it, and are therefore huge shitheads who deserve nothing but the worst.

As for the ""balls"" it takes to be a cop, being a cop is one of the safest and easiest professions. If you want to praise people for the risks they take at work, praise the construction workers, the taxi drivers, the bus drivers, the convenience store clerks, the social workers and the manufacturing workers. All of these people are at a greater risk of being injured, assaulted or killed at work. If a cop is killed at work, there's someone held responsible. If any of these people are killed at work, it's usually the cops job to defend their killers."

Hm. your comment made me look more carefully at how those two private methods are being used. And I noticed something I didn't see before. Only one of the synchronized methods is private. It is only called from the constructor.

In this case, since it's called from the constructor, is it possible for two threads to be using the same instance? Does it even make sense for this method to be synchronized?

The other synchronized method is public, and is called from another class. And looking at how it's used, it makes sense that it's synchronized (it's doing a bunch of file writes which need to be consistent with each other).

&gt;Now, question for you, how do make a variable thread safe?

So if we have a man, without a pulse, with asystole in all leads, who isn't breathing, with 'obvious signs of death', who we are not currently providing any medical care to, and turn the scene over to PD, to secure until the coroner gets there, I'd say that's about as 'declaring' as you can get."

Lancaster1983,Ebay,1390597521.0,"When you sell an item on eBay... *you the seller have to pay fees*. This is standard.

If you do not pay the invoice, eBay will restrict you and possibly send you to collections for payment. PayPal (if utilized) deducts the fees when the payment is received so no worries there.

If and when they find out you are younger than 18, they will likely issue a permanent restriction.

This is separate from every team, and their job is to make the league rules, negotiate with the union, and negotiate contracts with sponsors and media.  It's organized as a non-profit because it actually makes no profit.  All profits that are made by ""The NFL"" are passed on to the individual teams and taxes are payed at the team level.  So to answer that question, it's because it wouldn't really matter.  If they reclassified as a for-profit organization they still wouldn't pay any taxes since they make no profit.

The reason it's given an anti-trust exemption is so that it can form league-wide rules and make the salary cap.  If normal businesses did this it would be considered collusion.  For example if Coke and Pepsi got together and set wage limits for the entire soda industry it would be highly illegal.  But the courts recognized that even though the individual teams are separate businesses, they are specially linked together in a way that Coke and Pepsi aren't.  They aren't direct competitors, but 32 businesses that work in conjunction with another and that an anti-trust exemption is critical to the function of a sports league.  "

I say this as someone who's been living in Edmonton for about 2 1/2 years, having lived 27 of the first 31 years of my life in Southern Ontario. The fact of the matter is that the labour market is quite favourable in Edmonton. If you talk to folks down in Employment Edmonton (an arms length City agency), if you subtract the portion of the unemployed population that are not actually seeking work, the effective unemployment rate is less than 0.5%. When unemployment is that low, there will be labour shortages in every sector, which drive up wages across the board. 

Edmonton however, has not seen its housing market, and particularly its residential property assessments grow nearly to the same degree as say Vancouver or Toronto, or for that matter Calgary. What that means is that while wages having been rising, the costs of housing have not matched them. In other words, two people working two shitty jobs (&lt;$40k) without any post-secondary can afford to support themselves and raise a family on that kind of household income.

Further to that is the knowledge, like you have pointed out, that there exist jobs in the energy sector that don't require any post-secondary and where you can still make decent money ($65k+). Now present that to an 18 year old and tell them that they can either do that or they can go to school for four years for the right to accumulate $50k or more in debt to come for jobs paying MAYBE that much their first year, and which one are they going to choose? 

There is less importance placed on formal education here, but that's because it hasn't been necessary. Times they are a changing though, as out of the 50 people in my office, maybe 10 of them are actual Albertans. The rest are from elsewhere. Why? Education requirements.

So, to conclude, this is a culture where you can live on marginally retail money and raise a family, where the trades drive the labour market, where you don't need a formal education, and where there is a disincentive to investing in such a formal education. While five years into a more professional career, you MIGHT be making more than the dude who is working outside most of the year, they will have been working for almost a decade by that point with ZERO potential debt. 

It is debt that makes a tougher economy even harder back east. It is the relatively low levels of personal consumer debt out west that allow people to live a standard of living unfathomable on that same income virtually anywhere else in Canada.

eighthgear,badhistory,1390598269.0,"&gt; Apparently they did two other maps as well. One on evolution (/u/Unidan can tell us how much bad biology this is)

You don't need Unidan, since the map basically begins with evolution and ends with eugenics, with man split into various categories - the Latin Races, Germans, Anglo/Americans, Negroids, etc. It is pure eugenics tripe.

&gt; One can conceive a formula based on area, armies and navies, population, wealth, mineral and other natural resources. But imponderable, indeterminable factors such as the courage, vitality, culture and resources of a people are often of more moment than material factors in the course of history, and therefore must be taken into account in any such estimate

China (among many other others, I'm just using China as an example) should be massive under either ""method"". If you want to talk about pure power, the ancient and medieval Chinese dynasties frequently fielded massive armies, put to sea vast fleets, extracted tribute from their neighbors, etc. And if one wants to talk about ""culture"" or ""vitality"", Chinese cultural beliefs and practices have not only survived the test of time, but they have also spread to its neighbors, where they have had a lasting impact. 

Instead, this histomap really screws over China. I mean, at least they are consistently present, but that is about it. Also, despite that guy's assertions about how he made it based on culture and the like, it is pretty clear that he really was just looking at Eurocentric values of ""development"". For example, Japan ends the chart with a much larger slice than China. Did Japanese culture somehow overtake Chinese culture? I don't even know how that would be measured. What changed was that Japan modernized, adopting a European-style economy, after the Meiji Revolution. So that makes them bigger than China."

I wouldn't recommend maxing settings and trying to run 30 programs in the background, but if you wanna run 720p and have a browser, music, and a movie going on 1 monitor (or HD TV in my case) it works perfectly. 

Funny story, Of course I overclock so I'm running between 3.8 and 3.9 Ghz. With the exception of start up being quicker, I really don't use up that extra ""oomph."" According to my CPU usage meter, I usually barely crack 20% usage or 30% Ram usage.  

But yeah, if you are looking to make an impressive bargin rig,  a 4100 is the way to go. Hell you might even be able to get a better model or use the extra cash for thermal paste and a beefy graphics card. The 6670 I use is the EXACT SAME CARD IN AN XBONE it gives disapointing performance when you go for 1920 x 1080 but runs smooth at the resolution just below that and runs super fast if you play around with custom settings for optimization. I would recommend a 7790HD or even a 7770 for that sweet spot of performance and price.

clockworkgirl21,worldnews,1390599553.0,"Swedish Pediatric Society:

&gt;Circumcision of young boys for religious and non-medical reasons ought to be banned in Sweden. ""We consider it to be an assault on these boys,"" said Staffan Janson, chairman of the committee for ethical issues and childrens' rights. Children are unable to form a decision in the matter. Circumcision is an attack on boys' integrity. ""It's such a complicated and difficult question, but even so, we've decided that this is a procedure to be done away with,"" Janson said.""It's a mutilation of a child unable to decide for himself."" 

Royal Australasian College of Physicians:

&gt;""Ethical and human rights concerns have been raised regarding elective infant male circumcision because it is recognized that the foreskin has a functional role, the operation is non-therapeutic and the infant is unable to consent. After reviewing the currently available evidence, the RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand.""
""The foreskin has two main functions. Firstly it exists to protect the glans penis. Secondly the foreskin is a primary sensory part of the penis, containing some of the most sensitive areas of the penis.""
""The potential harms include contravention of individual rights, loss of choice, loss of function, procedural and psychological complications. . . . A boy circumcised as an infant may deeply resent this when he grows older; he may want what he cannot have – not to have been circumcised. . . . The option of leaving circumcision until later, when the boy is old enough to make a decision for himself does need to be raised with parents and considered. . . . The ethical merit of this option is that it seeks to respect the child’s physical integrity, and capacity for autonomy by leaving the options open for him to make his own autonomous choice in the future.

Royal Dutch Medical Association:

&gt;""There is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene. Partly in light of the complications which can arise during or after circumcision, circumcision is not justifiable except on medical/therapeutic grounds. . . . Contrary to what is often thought, circumcision entails the risk of medical and psychological complications. . . . Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is contrary to the rule that minors may only be exposed to medical treatments if illness or abnormalities are present. . . . Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors conflicts with the child's right to autonomy and physical integrity. . . . Complications in the area of sexuality have also been reported as have extreme pain experiences in newborns causing behavioral changes which are still apparent years later. Similarly, the high social costs of circumcision  as a result of complications have been cited. . . . The foreskin is a complex, erotogenic structure that plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts, such as penetrative intercourse and masturbation. The many attempts by men to restore their foreskins by mechanical or surgical means also contradict the idea that the foreskin is a useless part of the body."" 

British Medical Association:

&gt;“The BMA does not believe that parental preference alone constitutes sufficient grounds for performing a surgical procedure on a child unable to express his own view. Parental preference must be weighed in terms of the child's interests. . . . The BMA considers that the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it. . . . Some doctors may wish to not perform circumcisions for reasons of conscience. Doctors are under no obligation to comply with a request to circumcise a child.”

Another thing you have to consider is how the piracy is occurring at this point. As soon as you make a DvD release, someone will buy it, or borrow it, and rip the DvD and put it up on pirate bay. Within an hour. If rather than release a DvD, you released a digital copy, within the guidelines I outlined above, a week *before* you release a physical disk, many people would buy your digital copy for the sake of convenience and you might even manage to delay propagation of pirated content by removing potential seeders.

Also you can't fall into the trap of thinking that someone pirating a copy is the exact same thing as losing a sale *or* stealing a copy. Both of those are false analogies. First there is nothing to steal, a digital copy costs zero resources. While I concede that producing the entertainment, whatever it may be does cost money, you cannot tie the value of digital copies to that production cost lest you create in economic equation with infinite value. Once you've sold enough copies to recoup your outlay any digital copy you sell further is almost 100% profit, the longer you keep selling them the larger your margin grows.

To wit, if you assert that digital copies of entertainment media must have a set value based on the capital outlay of the original production, you introduce a critically flawed value equation into your economy. This is becoming a bigger and bigger problem, and will continue to become larger and more critical in the next few decades because the basic economic theory behind capitalism is unable to cope with the realities of perfect digital reproduction of information where information is treated as a commodity."

Letting yourself be overcome by anger is seen as a childish/adolescent thing to do, not manly. On the internet, it means you've lost the discussion and people will make fun of you (""lol you mad?""). Self-control is one of the most valued traits of masculinity.

WideFoot,INTP,1390600062.0,"No, I understand that point.  I am aware of the money for effort and innovation relationship that an employee has with his or her employer.  My point is that my aptitudes, skills, and interests aren't lining up with my career path on a fundamental level, but I am not sure how I can make what I am good at into a product or service that can make money, in my current firm or anywhere else.  

Eventually, my firm will run out of the training programs I've been running on or they'll need me to fill a vacant engineer or managerial position.  The ""lean"" offices common to my current field don't really have room for non-traditional roles.  My office is run almost like a military unit, with rigidly defined positions and ranks (which are numbered and associated directly to pay scale).  Training is done reluctantly, and only if the certification is required to win some work, because it otherwise interferes with the ability of that employee to be billable.  

The things on which I thrive and excel - field work, mechanical trouble shooting, unfamiliar situations, travel, editing, and quality control - are not valued in the corporate hierarchy and are most frequently seen as liabilities and expenses to be avoided or minimized whenever possible.  The things which make the company money (that we produce) - design calculations, report writing, clerical work, and meetings - are the things at which I am worst, take the most time to do, and do with greatest difficulty.  

I think that my aptitudes, talents, and interests must be useful in some way, but I don't know where, how, or to whom.  I have been advised from a very young age that engineering is the career for me.  I think this advice was based on my fascination with Legos and computer drawings programs as a child combined with some decent grades in school and an appreciation for science.  I've tried to find some form of engineering that will let me tinker and explore in the same way Legos and drawing programs do.  My experience in a couple different kinds of engineering offices has shown that probably isn't possible.  But, that experience comes too little, too late.  

What I need is a way to turn my aptitudes for quiet, thorough exploration (tinkering) and an ability to help others find precision in thought and word (editing) into a career.  Preferably, although not necessarily, a career that involves some physical component or adventure.  I have no idea where to start to find that kind of thing.  At age 26, that is really, really scary.  "

clockworkgirl21,worldnews,1390600459.0,"Swedish Pediatric Society:

Circumcision of young boys for religious and non-medical reasons ought to be banned in Sweden. ""We consider it to be an assault on these boys,"" said Staffan Janson, chairman of the committee for ethical issues and childrens' rights. Children are unable to form a decision in the matter. Circumcision is an attack on boys' integrity. ""It's such a complicated and difficult question, but even so, we've decided that this is a procedure to be done away with,"" Janson said.""It's a mutilation of a child unable to decide for himself.""

Royal Australasian College of Physicians:

""Ethical and human rights concerns have been raised regarding elective infant male circumcision because it is recognized that the foreskin has a functional role, the operation is non-therapeutic and the infant is unable to consent. After reviewing the currently available evidence, the RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand."" ""The foreskin has two main functions. Firstly it exists to protect the glans penis. Secondly the foreskin is a primary sensory part of the penis, containing some of the most sensitive areas of the penis."" ""The potential harms include contravention of individual rights, loss of choice, loss of function, procedural and psychological complications. . . . A boy circumcised as an infant may deeply resent this when he grows older; he may want what he cannot have – not to have been circumcised. . . . The option of leaving circumcision until later, when the boy is old enough to make a decision for himself does need to be raised with parents and considered. . . . The ethical merit of this option is that it seeks to respect the child’s physical integrity, and capacity for autonomy by leaving the options open for him to make his own autonomous choice in the future.

Royal Dutch Medical Association:

""There is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene. Partly in light of the complications which can arise during or after circumcision, circumcision is not justifiable except on medical/therapeutic grounds. . . . Contrary to what is often thought, circumcision entails the risk of medical and psychological complications. . . . Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is contrary to the rule that minors may only be exposed to medical treatments if illness or abnormalities are present. . . . Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors conflicts with the child's right to autonomy and physical integrity. . . . Complications in the area of sexuality have also been reported as have extreme pain experiences in newborns causing behavioral changes which are still apparent years later. Similarly, the high social costs of circumcision as a result of complications have been cited. . . . The foreskin is a complex, erotogenic structure that plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts, such as penetrative intercourse and masturbation. The many attempts by men to restore their foreskins by mechanical or surgical means also contradict the idea that the foreskin is a useless part of the body.""

British Medical Association:

“The BMA does not believe that parental preference alone constitutes sufficient grounds for performing a surgical procedure on a child unable to express his own view. Parental preference must be weighed in terms of the child's interests. . . . The BMA considers that the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it. . . . Some doctors may wish to not perform circumcisions for reasons of conscience. Doctors are under no obligation to comply with a request to circumcise a child.”

What's more, international doctors protested the AAP's stance.

http://knmg.artsennet.nl/Nieuws/Nieuwsarchief/Nieuwsbericht/International-physicians-protest-against-American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-policy-on-infant-male-circumcision.htm

Thought I'd throw this in for good measure:

It was found that the nerve block a lot of doctors give infants for circumcisions doesn't do a whole lot for pain:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0012623/

And just out of curiosity, how do you feel about clitoral hood circumcision? It's the type of circumcision women in places like Brunei, Singapore, and Indonesia undergo as babies, and it's very similar to male circumcision. They don't lose their clitorises and their vaginas aren't sewn shut. Most of those women don't consider themselves mutilated at all and do it to their daughters. It's also done by a doctor. Yet this is still considered mutilation in the USA."

Playing hackysack when we were bored in high school helped coordinating my feet, maybe try that. As for learning what your body wants, that just takes experience from listening to your body and giving it what you feel it needs. If the feeling persists you might have been wrong and will need to try something else. 

My brother and I know we are each in tune with our bodies and will intentionally throw things at each other when we ask for something. Things hardly ever get dropped and it keeps us on our toes and more focused on the world than off in our heads when we are together. Maybe proposition your friends/roommates to do this to you so you can improve over time (don't throw knives or breakable things to start).

Jacksambuck,PurplePillDebate,1390601053.0,"&gt;I am pretty submissive and sensitive, I'd be eaten alive in a sub that was ok with poop slinging. I would just stop participating.

This goes for the other side too. I don't enjoy being told what I can and can't say. There are lots of ""safe spaces"" on reddit already, that I avoid like the plague. One of the reasons this sub is so active and I appreciate it, is that its rules are pretty lax, partly because TRP is offensive by nature and any sub accomodating them must at least shelve rules prohibiting sexism and stuff.

&gt;How does a non-banning sub foster discussion that includes the thoughts of the meek or those that have no interest in dealing with a culture of personal attacks and purposeful word twisting?

I don't trust mods to make objective decisions. At equal snark, posters you agree with will always appear less aggressive than posters you disagree with. That's why heavily moderated subs turn into CJs of ideologically homogeneous participants.

And the meek are rarely attacked. It's mostly loudmouths/snarkers going at each other. 

Accusations of ""word twisting"" and ""bad faith"" arguing are, imo, even less objective than rules like ""no personal attacks"", and as such contribute even faster to the downfall of discussion.  You say someone twists words, but to him it is you who is twisting his words into word twisting, so it's his word against yours. In the end, the mod decides based entirely on his personal bias on the discussion at hand.  "

clockworkgirl21,worldnews,1390601074.0,"The Royal Australasian College of Physicians is just one of the associations that consider the foreskin very important and is against circumcision because of it:

""Ethical and human rights concerns have been raised regarding elective infant male circumcision because it is recognized that the foreskin has a functional role, the operation is non-therapeutic and the infant is unable to consent. After reviewing the currently available evidence, the RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand."" ""The foreskin has two main functions. Firstly it exists to protect the glans penis. Secondly the foreskin is a primary sensory part of the penis, containing some of the most sensitive areas of the penis."" ""The potential harms include contravention of individual rights, loss of choice, loss of function, procedural and psychological complications. . . . A boy circumcised as an infant may deeply resent this when he grows older; he may want what he cannot have – not to have been circumcised. . . . The option of leaving circumcision until later, when the boy is old enough to make a decision for himself does need to be raised with parents and considered. . . . The ethical merit of this option is that it seeks to respect the child’s physical integrity, and capacity for autonomy by leaving the options open for him to make his own autonomous choice in the future.

kornberg,relationship_advice,1390601107.0,"You guys are married now, your finances are combined. There really isn't a mine and yours, it's an ours. If my husband, who supported us for several years before we were married and is possibly about to make a crapton more than I do, overspends, that doesn't just affect him, it affects both of us. His monthly budget for random whatever is $100--if he spends $100 over budget every month, we've lost $1200 in our savings account. This could be the difference between having a vacation or remodeling our kitchen or buying a new car or whatever it is we're saving for at the time. In fact, he *was* overspending at one point and it pushed back the purchase of our home by 6 months. That's 6 months of paying rent and not building home equity, which pushes a bunch of other stuff back. Your husband may make more, but his spending affects your life just as much as his.

If you're wanting to buy a house, $10K is a big chunk of a down payment and that is a big chunk out of your savings. You are also not sure about your employment when you get overseas, it's very foolish to go spend huge amounts of money on non-essentials before you have that squared away. Again, you're a family and you have goals and need to maintain a safety net. 

My advice is to sit down and plan out your future with him. When do you want to buy a house, where do you want to live, how much are houses in that area, etc. What vacations do you want to take, what expenses will you have during the relocation and subsequent move (you *always*spend a lot of money moving) and other things like that. What's the plan if you can't find a job for a few months? What kind of financial safety net do you want? A good idea is to have 6 months of all of your bills in savings, at the absolute least. What other things do you guys want to have in your life? Once that's all down, the cost of flying 5 people out to your country is going to look a lot more expensive to him. Bring it up and say that you love how generous he is and how important his family is to him but that you'd like to wait on extending the invitation to his family. Cite the goals you have, your uncertain employment status and how freaking expensive it's going to be. Don't let him rationalize out of it and call him on his shit if he tries to say that he won't pay for this or that--you know he will so say ""Dude, we both know that you'll end up paying for that.""

Yes, money talks are hard but it's part of being married. Don't wait until you're committed to something or are financially screwed, deal with it now instead of later and it'll be a lot easier. "

devilinmexico13,Pathfinder_RPG,1390601158.0,"I'm going to go on a bit of a rant here, please forgive me.

I think this is the most utterly horrible idea I have ever heard for a character. To address all the people who are saying this is an excellent roleplaying idea, and to preemptively address all the replies to this rant of ""But roleplaying, man, its not about numbers"" you are all forgetting that this isn't roleplaying. That's what you do in the bedroom with consenting adults. This is a roleplaying **GAME**, not just roleplaying. Part of it being a game is that you have a resposibility to your team (your party, or your PFS table) to function at your role. Part of function in this game is the ability to survive in combat, which this character concept would absolutely suck at. 


Secondly, again addressing the people who are claiming this is an excellent roleplaying choice, STOP. Your not at all thinking this through. Constitution is a measure of a characters health and stamina. Average ability scores for most humanoids is 10, this character would have half of that. Now, ask yourself this: What fucking business does a character with late stage pancreatic cancer have fucking ADVENTURING? Because that's basically what your building here, a character so sickly they basically couldn't survive stubbing their goddamned toe. How is that a good roleplaying choice at all? I would posit that it is, in fact, a terrible roleplaying choice, especially for PFS, which assumes your all members in good standing of the Pathfinder Society and have completed the usually dangerous training and confirmation process of the Society. Not only are you making the terrible roleplaying choice of assuming that your AIDS patient survived this training, you're **forcing** everyone you share your table with to make this terrible roleplaying choice with you by suspending their disbelief that you would have survived to adulthood without a bad cold ending your life. 

Sure, min/max-ing can lead to bad roleplaying, but that does not mean that making deliberately poor mechanical choices makes you a good roleplayer. In fact, if you think it through, really put some thought into what a person with a 5 CON would by like, I would say this makes you a WORSE roleplayer than the munchkiny-est character you can point out. I'd at least believe that that guy survived into adulthood, which I would not believe of your supposed adventurer with Lou Gehrig's Disease. 

As always, Rule 1 applies, and if you're having fun your not doing anything wrong so long as everyone else is having fun. I know that I would not be able to enjoy myself with the level of suspension of disbelief that this character would force me to put up with. /rant

TLDR: Making poor mechanical choices isn't automatically a good roleplaying choice, and, especially in this instance, strains credulity that the character would survive into adulthood, let alone survive to be accepting into the Pathfinder Society. "

fingers-crossed,electronic_cigarette,1390601582.0,"Hot damn this is a tough one! Here's what I'll go with for now, and in no particular order.

* Bombies - Seven Seas. I would describe it as a fruiter tasting blue raspberry flavored candy with a touch of cool. I love this one because I taste something new and different every time I vape it. Especially as it steeps certain flavors come out and to the forefront. Definitely a few types of berry and some citrus, but that's all I can pinpoint. Fantastic both as an ADV and a drunk-and-chainvaping vape. 

* Vapor Trails NW - Sasquatch. Fuck, this stuff is complex. Three main components - berry, cream, nuts, with maybe a hint of honey. Each blends well with the others and nothing really dominates the other flavors. Super smooth, only tried it in my dripper but the flavor is deep and lingers enough that once it finally disappears from your palate you're just left wanting to take another puff so you can taste it again.

* Adirondack Vapor - Cinnamon Roll. HNGGGGGGGGGGGGGG so incredibly good. I actually had forgotten about this because I'm letting mine steep, written a different one here, and now I'm editing it out and replacing it with this. This stuff is so good where I'd probably rather vape it than eat a real cinnamon roll. Everything is balanced incredibly well, the dough-y sweet cakiness of the roll/bread, sweet cinnamon flavor that comes in and lingers in your mouth making you smack your lips. If this juice was a person, I would want to hang out with them every day and just bask in their excellence.

I wish there was some quantitative way of defining what is and isn't a circlejerk. I like talking about those. Unfortunately it's so hard to lock down in an easy-to-define that people can get away with just hateposting* and basically lowering the overall quality (in my opinion). Pure hateposts belong in /r/Negareddit or somewhere Not Here. In a perfect world, it wouldn't even be assumed that OP disagrees with the jerk. We're here to mock reddit and dissect its patterns and behaviours, not just to moan. Well maybe a little...

However, and I've said this before, I have no problem with low-effort posting though (although please stop *tagging* low-effort, we can SEE). There are many circlejerks that are common or self-evident that don't require dissection and I don't see any merit in a wall of text for its own sake when there's nothing interesting to say. Other jerks can benefit from a small write-up, and others still do benefit from an essay-length deconstruction. The post should be tailored to the jerk, IMO. Longer does not mean better and the point of diminishing returns will be hit sooner with some jerks than others.

noseonarug17,Games,1390604039.0,"M&amp;B is third person (default, anyways) and very strategy oriented - especially in battle - and it is a sandbox with essentially no story.

KC:D is first person and is story oriented with no indication of strategy. The world map is much smaller, but the character is always present, as opposed to M&amp;B's travel system or city menus. The RPG elements are quite different; notably the inclusion of perks. Character customization is much more limited; though there are far more clothing options the main character will be a male blacksmith and there aren't really any other backstory options (unless the stretch is met to add a female character).

The settings are certainly comparable and the fan base will likely have a good chunk of overlap, but the two games go in very different directions.

Each NFL offseason, teams throughout the league seek to improve their rosters for the coming campaign. And, as is always the case, some teams have more reconstruction to do than others.

Which teams saw the biggest drop offs in 2013 and have the most to improve upon? We're turning to our NFL player grades to see which five teams regressed the most from 2012 to 2013. We focused on what caused them to fall, whether the decline will endure and what they'll need to fix to right the ship in 2014.

We start with our biggest ""drop"" of 2013, a team that lost a star player on the outside and never recovered.



1. Atlanta Falcons, -242.4 decline
Dropping off: In 2012, Roddy White finished the year as our sixth-ranked receiver. It was arguably the finest year of his career, as he dropped just four of 96 catchable balls for the ninth-best drop rate in the league. In 2013, however, he had issues staying on the field. And when he was on the field, his hands weren't nearly as reliable, dropping eight of 71 catchable balls and ending the year with the 21st-worst (out of 94 players) drop rate. What's more, he averaged 0.72 fewer yards per route run than he did in 2012, a year where his 2.08 yards per route run was even more than Julio Jones.

Mirage or makeover: There's no denying some of White's struggles can be attributed to him battling injury most of the year, but the physical receiver is no spring chicken and will turn 33 in November. We certainly expect more from him in 2014, and getting Jones healthy will ensure less attention and easier matchups. Jones may have only run 212 routes in 2013 but his 2.74 yards per route run was the highest of all receivers.

Must address: Franchise quarterback? Check. Options to catch the ball? Check. Solid pass protection? Not so much. The Falcons lost two key members of their line in the retired Todd McClure and released Tyson Clabo, and had a hard time replacing them. Plus, OT Sam Baker looked like a one-year wonder, making his contract extension seem like a con job; in just 190 snaps, he earned a minus-14.4 grade. That meant more new faces than Matt Ryan was hoping to see and a line that gave up more combined sacks, hits and hurries (264) than any other team. No wonder Ryan went from facing pressure on 29.3 percent of plays in 2012 to 41.3 percent a year later. The team needs to examine upgrading at every position along the offensive line, with the exception of left guard.



2. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, -228.1
Dropping off: The offensive attack was set to be built on Doug Martin after his stellar rookie year that saw him force the fourth-most missed tackles of all running backs. But even before injury ended his season, things weren't looking quite as peachy for Martin. He was averaging a full yard per carry fewer, had dropped the highest percentage of catchable balls of any running back and was something of a liability in pass protection. He was experiencing a real sophomore slump.

Mirage or makeover: It's easy to fall in love with big numbers, but Martin did pick up 54.6 percent of his yards in just five of his games, suggesting something of a boom-or-bust runner. So while we wouldn't necessarily expect the same shoddiness from him as we saw this year, the jury is very much out on how consistent a player he'll be, especially if the team shoehorns him into an every-down role where his protection and receiving abilities will be exposed.

Must address: You could pick any number of units, but the run blocking was terrible throughout most of the year. If you're looking for the chief reason why, then focus on the return to fitness and form of Davin Joseph, one of the most overrated players in the league. A constant underachiever despite what the contract and Pro Bowls may indicate, he's never converted his tools into even solid performances. In 2013, he posted the lowest run-blocking score among guards. With Carl Nicks possibly having to retire because of complications from MRSA, it's incredible how much money Tampa Bay has invested at the guard spot and how little the Bucs have received in return.



3. Oakland Raiders, -200.9
Dropping off: The Raiders carried over very few decent players into the 2013 season, but one was Jared Veldheer. Unfortunately, injury struck in his contract year and when he did get on the field, he didn't look like the same player. His 96.1 pass-blocking efficiency score ranked 11th-best of all left tackles in 2012 before dropping to 93.2 a year later.

Mirage or makeover: Oakland is so short on quality players that it's hard to see it letting Veldheer hit the open market, so we'd expect him back and his form to turn around sharply. There's nothing to suggest he won't be able to hit the heights of 2012, when he established himself as one of the better young left tackles in the league.

Must address: You can't win in this league without good play at the quarterback position, especially when you've got the supporting cast Oakland does. So the choice is between building a roster for a shining knight quarterback to ride to the rescue of, or going all-in on one in the upcoming draft. It's not viable for the team to assume Terrelle Pryor or Matt McGloin will take the giant leap to be even an adequate option after Pryor finished 34th (out of 41 QBs) in our adjusted accuracy percentage rankings and McGloin finished dead last.



4. New York Giants, -187.8
Dropping off: While it would be easy to blame the Giants' struggles on quarterback issues, there's no denying that Eli Manning regressed back to his early years with some careless play that didn't do justice to how talented the two-time Super Bowl winner has proved to be over his career. His 15 interceptions in 2012 were far from ideal, but 27 a year later? That's inexcusable, especially with a stunning 17 of them coming when he wasn't pressured. You can't blame that on the offensive line.

Mirage or makeover: It's hard to tell because Manning has always been something of a law unto himself. He overcame a porous offensive line in 2011 to push his team to a Super Bowl, showing top-level poise and precision. But since then he's been fighting a battle for consistency and returned to his streaky ways. Maybe it's time to accept that's just who Manning is, knowing a hot streak is just around the corner.

Must address: Remember when the Giants had one of the best offensive lines in the league? Well, it's been a rough transition since then, and their pass blocking this year was laughable at times. Rookie Justin Pugh played better as the season progressed, while players such as Will Beatty failed to play up to their potential. In 2012, Beatty earned every bit of his big deal with tremendous play, including surrendering a pressure on 4.8 percent of pass blocks; however, in 2013, that number jumped to 9.7 percent. He's not the only one you're left wondering about, as Chris Snee is likely on his way out (there's no justifying his $11.75 million cap hit) and David Diehl is set to retire. Right now it would take a brave man to tell you with any degree of certainty who will start along the interior of New York's O-line in 2014.



5. New England Patriots, -180.1
Dropping off: After 2012, we went as far as to call Ryan Wendell our secret superstar on the Patriots, as no center had as high a run-blocking grade. Of course, we did warn that his pass protection would need to improve if he was to challenge the top-tier centers for end-of-season honors. Unfortunately, not only did his pass protection get worse (10 more quarterback disruptions allowed) but his run-blocking fell off a cliff. He fell from the top spot in 2012 to 14th-worst in 2013, and now center is a position the Patriots may need to look to upgrade in the offseason.

Mirage or makeover: Wendell clearly is never going to be a reliable pass-blocking center. He's just not good enough to slow down pass-rushers, let alone stop them. So there's no mirage there. But we've seen him generate movement at the point of attack and even this year he graded positively (in the run game) eight times. He hasn't played himself out of a job, but he has played himself into a competition for his starting spot.

Must Address: A lot might depend on how good Vince Wilfork is when he comes back from injury, because the team was much weaker in his absence. The additions of Chris Jones (minus-21.3 run defense) and Joe Vellano (minus-3.0) showed a lack of depth, and with Wilfork turning 33 in November, the team can't expect the same usage out of him going forward (he featured on 81.3 percent of snaps in 2012). Moreover, it looks like Brandon Spikes' behavior has run him out of New England and that leaves the Pats short on a true impact player against the run, with Spikes a terror at knifing through gaps. The middle of the front seven could use a fresh face or two."

DangerAndAdrenaline,guns,1390605121.0,"This is all my opinion, and plenty of people may disagree, but here it is:

Russia and China are rising.

Russia is doing it in a more obvious manner by raising their military strength and embarrassing the USA in a number of episodes; most notably the Syria incident where he made a fool of Kerry and H.Clinton (and by proxy, Obama). Putin is cracking down on dissenters yet still appealing to the world's ""conscious"" by telling his courts to free in-the-news dissenters such as PussyRiot. Which has nothing to do with the fact that he is holding power with an iron fist and still jailing non-newsworthy dissenters by the hundreds.

China is more AND less authoritarian than Russia, but just as nationalistic. China has a huge population that is vastly poor with small (relative to the total population) urban centers. China is positioning itself as a global economic and military leader. They buy and sell huge amounts of debt and they strongarm their geographic location for political gain. (Look at N. Korea -- if it wasn't for China, that disaster of a ""country"" would be stopped. But China doesn't want N. Korea to go away. They like the physical buffer along their border much the same that the US enjoy's a relatively stable Mexico).

The US is a political machine. We change our head of government every 4 years. In a period of safety, we are increasingly isolationist (we are, despite running a two front war -- we don't care about geo-political events, we only want to deal with gay marriage, snowden, and the legalization of marijuana). We have a very diplomatic president (which, depending on your point of view, is good or bad).

Unfortunately for the USA, diplomacy and fair-mindedness only works when the other parties are willing to be diplomatic and fair-minded.

Russia proved they don't care in the Syria event (if you weren't paying attention before) and China has exerted un-opposed muscle as well with their laying-of-claim to sovereign Japan worthless islands to which no one has truly tested yet.

No one is going to like me on Reddit for this claim, but I recall Bush in 2000 or 2001 when we had a spy plane emergency land in China. Bush held strong and got our troops and the remains of the plane back quickly (although all classified data was destroyed anyway).

We had a chance to help the Syrian rebels (for better or worse) and make the new government indebted to the USA. Instead, we let it slide and left it to the Russians who will own Syria no matter what the outcome.

We had a chance when Iran rebelled to support the rebels. Instead we let Iran's government have political immunity who quashed the small rebellion and solidified their power. They are making fools of us at the UN as we pretend to stop their nuclear ambitions and they openly say that they are not stopping. Meanwhile we give them concessions for nothing.

We had a chance to influence the Egyptian revolution. We did not. We stated support for Mubarrak and got out of the way. Mubarrak was overthrown and we lost an ally in the region. (I am not stating support for Mubarrak, I am simply saying that we could have joined the rebels, or withdrawn support for Mubarrak, either would be a strong statement.)

Let me boil it down....

China and Russia are posturing as strong and extremely influential nations. And they have been successful.

The USA has been actively weakening itself under the guise of ""moral supremacy"" for years. And we have been successful.

In a 3/2/1 system that the IIHF uses, that team would have captured 70 of a possible 156 (.448%) assuming all wins came in regulation.

IMO, the NHL needs to drop the loser point or move to a 3/2/1 system.

And while I certainly understand that this situation is very tricky and hard, I'm not sure I could just kill them as soon as I saw them trespassing.

I mean, how exactly do you imagine it? Do you clean your newly bought weapon, you've probably trained a few times at a range, so you know how to aim down your sight at least, and then you load up your gun, and wait for the junkies to come? Do you get a chair and set it up next to the window facing the street? Or do you sit in front of the TV, hoping you'll hear them when they're around? Will you look for them all night long, keep yourself awake, pumped on coffeine? And if you see them, what exactly will you do? Will you wait behind the closed door until they're 4 steps unto your property, burst the door open, and shoot them? Or do you wait until you can see if it's a poor soul looking for a place to sleep somewhere tonight? Hell, maybe it's a drunk college student accidentally stumbling onto the wrong property. But no, you decide it's been enough, trespassing is trespassing, so you'll take another man's life just like that. You burst open the door, aim down the sight, and then you just pull the trigger one, two, maybe three times. Let's hope that junkie was alone, and let's hope his friends don't have a gun on them, either. And now there's police at your property, because you shot some junkie who was 4 steps onto your property, and you shot him without even telling him to fuck off beforehand, so it looks like you bloody murdered him. And you'll have to deal with the thought of killing a man for the rest of your life. You took another man's life because he wanted some fucking metal cans, and there might have been a *possibility* he might have done something stupid down the road sometime.

I don't know, man, but if you really think it's that fucking easy and uncomplicated, maybe you should sit down and think about this whole situation a bit more, and about how fucked up it is to shoot someone for stealing some of your cans out of your trash.

I can completely relate to your idea, and I totally get where you're coming from, trust me. Hell, sometimes I'm lying awake at night next to my SO, listening at sounds outside to check if that might be an actual danger, but I've never thought ""Oh well, better shoot them or they'll rape my SO""."

Obviously your mom is very scared.  Her concern and love for you are evident in her wanting to make sure you are anointed just in case.

If my own child was in your position I would be terrified.  I would say go through with it to make her happy and give her that little bit of peace of mind.  At least in her mind if you did not get up she can go on knowing in her heart that you are in a better place.  And you are going in for brain surgery...a couple hours of your time in church is not going to be what kills you.  Not like you have a lot of other pressing matters that need to be attended to.

A friend of mine was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer 5 years ago(She was supposed to stand with my wife and I at our wedding 2 which was 2 months after she passed).  She was also an atheist.  She went through the rigamaroll of confirming to be Catholic like her mother and sister.  It was totally for them to make them feel better.  It was a Monday.  Wednesday we got to celebrate her wedding to her long time boyfriend to standing ovation of the other patients(Those who could stand) and staff at the chapel in the hospital.  She passed away that Friday.  Talking with her family at the service her mom had a peace about her that I never saw while she was at her bed side.  That peace in ""knowing"" she was in a better place made a huge difference.

Life is for the living.  You might not like or agree with the anointing, but do it for your family if that is what will make them feel better.  You live thorugh it you will have to put up with the whole God saved you crap...but I think we can agree that is preferrable for all concerned then the not living option.

Good Luck, and give us a follow up with how you are doing after the surgery when you can."

sir_sri,AskMen,1390607062.0,"&gt;Where do they all disappear to?

Well everyone is different.  Lots of them go all in on work, or video games (world of warcraft type things) or reddit or the like, previous generations it ended up as a bunch of guys on shortwave (CB) radio chatting to each other  from  their basements.  

Once you've given up on finding a spouse, or given up on  enjoying time with the spouse you do have you look for other people who feel the same way, and you hang out together.  Sometimes that's golf, sometimes that's video games, work, internet discussion boards, or the like.  You can just  sit around on your arse and drink all night and watch TV and then  have TV to talk about with people after all.

&gt; I am 25 

The shy ones in your age range are probably playing video games or working.  25 is pretty young, there's a lot of people playing the startup or career advancement scene figuring (correctly) that if you can't get the women you want by being yourself, you can at least get physically attractive women  by being rich.  When they realize that's rarely fulfilling, and getting rich is quite hard they fall back on alternate plans.

Jacksambuck,PurplePillDebate,1390607686.0,"&gt;I guess I kind of go by the belief that we have both a moral duty to try not to be offensive and to do our best to not be offended.

I see it as an unspoken dichotomy. There's two ways to achieve a lack of offensiveness/hurt feelings. One is to force people not to say anything offensive (""try not to be offensive""), the other is to let offensiveness roll by us (""do our best not to be offended"").  

I find the first stifling to discussion and the search for truth. You appear to have clearly chosen the first, but present your position as if you supported both. 

&gt; I also feel it is the duty of the strong to protect the weak, and a personal duty to try to be the strongest we can be.

Why is the stoic (supporter of the second) assumed to be the strong? On the contrary, limiting others' discourse is dependent on power and the willingness to wield it for one's aims. 

""You're hurting me!"", in debate, from my POV, is more abusive and implicitly coercive than ""I don't care!"".

&gt;Why can't arguments be expected to stand on their own merits? Would you be suggesting allowing personal attacks to stand? I am still not understanding what kind of moderation you are proposing. 

None. Don't ban anyone, don't delete anything. Except perhaps OT *submissions*, and commercial spammers, bots and novelty accounts. Let DVs or the ignore function take care of the rest. No mod action, no bias.

If that isn't possible, I'll support anything with the least possible amount of bans and deletions.

little-nymphet,AskWomen,1390607737.0,"I'm not offended, and I do understand what you're saying. But there is no evidence to support a claim like that in court if you can't access the file itself.

I don't like using phrases like ""good Nazi"" or whatever, but one can't treat all WWII German officers, or Germans in general, as the same. The Nazis didn't have some sort of super-drug that turned every German into a mindless Jew-killing machine. The story of Nazi Germany is a story of, among other things, how otherwise normal, well-educated people came to fight for a cause that absolutely horrific, and to learn about Germany in WWII, one has to analyze these people as just that - individuals, who were not all the same. They had different limits, different tolerances, different motives, etc. Some were undeniably ""evil"", though historians don't like to use that term. Many weren't, but came to support an evil cause.

To pretend that every man who fought for Adolf Hitler was equally ""evil"" ignores not only complexity, but it also prevents one from thinking about how non-evil persons can support bad causes, and to what extent, based on all sorts of motivations, from honour and nationalism (like Rommel), to such things as science and engineering (think of Wernher von Braun)."

With longer femurs and a low bar position, dropping straight down will generally mean more forward lean.  High bar and front squats don't generally require the hips back cue and my struggles with those are likely due to inflexibility (or possibly the difference in hip joints, there was an article posted here a few weeks ago that made a point about that, but I have no idea what my hips look like inside, so I'm just making shit up here).

You're right about male nudity not being ""sexy"".  I think I've read that an erect penis pretty much guarantees a NC-17 rating, and a flaccid penis isn't particularly sexy at all.  The only instance of erect I can remember is in Un chant d'amour.  It may have happened in Y tu tambien, but I haven't seen the whole movie and only remember the two guys masturbating together.

I think part of the reason for this may come from the stereotype about women not being visual and preferring literary erotica, which is probably incorrectly reinforced by hearing so much about unwanted dick pics (but honestly, who want to just see disembodied genitalia?). I would say there has been a little rise in muscular ""eye candy"",  where I'm thinking mostly about shirtless Jacob in Twilight, Captain America, and Thor.

But you are right, female nudity does seem to be much less meaningful the majority of the time.

clockworkgirl21,worldnews,1390609856.0,"Many forms of female circumcision are very similar to male. Yes, the type where they cut off the clitoris and sew up the vagina is undeniably worse and is only used to destroy a woman's sexuality, but there are also many women who have had much milder forms.

http://maurina.wordpress.com/2007/11/16/female-circumcision-explained/

This woman from Brunei talks about her own circumcision and what's done to babies. It's pretty close to male circumcision. A doctor cuts off the skin *over* the clitoris. These women can still enjoy sex and do. The hood itself is even still there, as she says. 

Malaysia does a form that's even milder than that: a needle prick to the clitoris. Nothing is removed. Nothing even bleeds. Yes this is still illegal in the USA and considered to be mutilation.

http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/indonesia-ignores-un-ban-on-female-circumcision-denies-mutilation/

There's a site talking about Malaysian circumcision of girls.

Male circumcision grew in popularity in the 1800s in the United States as a way to control the sexuality of boys.

&gt;Circumcision is – or rather has been – common in many English-speaking countries. This is due to a trend from the Victorian age where doctors recommended that boys should be circumcised as this would make it more difficult to masturbate.

http://sciencenordic.com/male-circumcision-leads-bad-sex-life

Also, why is removing a woman's clitoral hood considered to be bad then? It's formed from the same tissues that forms the foreskin in human males, and it's homologous to the foreskin as well. They also have the same functions; basically keeping the glans moist and covered. Most importantly, medical science acknowledges that the clitoral hood and the foreskin are homologous.

AlfredHawthorneHill,AskReddit,1390610049.0,"Not at all.  I think /u/zenofire is being too precious by half in insisting that, taken as a whole, gender differences exist and that it is impossible to generalize with any accuracy.  Under any reasonable interpretation, OP was asking about generalizations rather than asking about things that, with 100%, zero-exceptions, verifiable certainty apply to all women and men everywhere at every time.  Are some women more physically imposing and stronger than most men?  Absolutely.  Are some men among the best cooks in the world?  Hell yeah.  That said, /u/zenofire (and, no doubt, an unfortunate cadre of kindred souls) insist that speaking in terms of generalities or probabilities is outright wrong and improper.  Speaking from personal experience in defying a whole host of stereotypes I know that generalities are not 100% reliable but I am not about to pretend that they lack some legitimate basis/bases."

Not just because I say so, but because of the objective facts of the origins and purpose of the police force. Your mates protect and serve the rich, which means fucking over everyone else. Have they beaten up any fare-evading high schoolers lately? How about murdered some Aboriginals in custody? A weekend is pretty dull unless you're breaking the legs of uni students isn't it? And it's a pretty boring life unless you work for an organisation which does all of this as standard fucking practice, and you do nothing about it.

What takes guts is walking down the street as an Aboriginal, a Muslim, a protestor, or a unionist, knowing that cops can and do kill people like you all the time, and that if they do attack you *there is nothing you can do*. I'm not going to fawn over murdering thug cops and how brave they are, just because some of them get married and have babies. Don't you think the Aboriginals murdered in custody have families too? Don't the women raped by cops have families? The fact that workers have families doesn't stop cops showing up to strikes and beating them senseless. Cops have a relatively safe and cushy job. The people cops attack usually aren't so fortunate."

If she could keep something so important a secret, what else could she do to you without regard for your feelings and your future?

It really sounds like you two have different values here. You want a partner who finds fulfillment in the workplace and who adds a second stable income. It's not a bad value, and neither is wanting to be a full-time parent. The problem is that you guys don't agree and you're married with a baby on the way.

Also, 'the blue coated worker', which was a quite reasonable sociological study of police unionism, and the social, political, and economic roles of the modern police force in it's place of origin (Britain), and in the US and Europe. In my opinion the best account of the origins and development of the modern police force is 'crime, class and corruption' by A. Farrell, which analyses the roots of crime in society, and the inability of police to address this due to their role and class position. 'policing industrial disputes' and 'to break a union' are also interesting. If you want to look at a more Australian perspective on cops as a force for suppressing workers, 'penal colony to penal powers' is good. It's also a great history of industrial relations in Australia from the 1770's to the mid 1960's.

He had never been around toddlers, as far as anyone knew, but had been around babies and older children; it was somewhat unknown with a toddler, and we took the small chance and lost.  Obviously this was noted, and made it a no-go in my household, but we did return the dog to the rescue and do hope he has found a good home without small children.  There's always the chance the rescue simply lied about the dog to place him, and I'll always wonder.  I'll not ever use that particular rescue again, just because I have heard enough from friends and relatives that this does happen from time to time with rescue organizations, and has happened to others I know.

dutchguy94,dayz,1390611581.0,"DayZ helicopters in my opinion:

* **Amount of helicopters**: the way you balance the helicopters is not always by small numbers, in my opinion there should be between 4 and 7 helicopters per server. this doesnt mean that there will be 4 to 7 helicopters flying around, but there will probably be 2 maybe 3 helicopters flying which brings me to the next point.

* **Repairing the helicopters**: obviously finding loose helicopter parts IRL is very hard, so thats where the extra helicopters come in. since there are now atleast 5 helicopters on the map, your main parts resource will be by stripping the other helicopters and using their bits to repair.

* **Parts**: when it comes to parts, I'd prefer some really in-depth repairing. So I dont want to see main parts like ""main-rotor assembly"", I want to see parts more in the sense of: ""rotorblade"", ""sparkplugs"", ""enginebelt"", ""swashplate"".

* **Flight models**: I'd like to see a full port over from the Take on Helicopters helicopters, in my opinion this is something which makes the helicopters more balanced overall due to the fact that you cant afford to land in tight places or take fire.

* **Learning to fly/maintain/repair**: books, all the needed knowledge can be found in books.

* **Repairing mechanics**: I would like to see action points on the outside of vehicles (like here http://youtu.be/xwR0mfjwibc) so you actually have to walk to the position where you need to repair for added immersion.
there should also be a failure state to repairing, not an RNG failure state but actual human failure e.g. working on electronics with the batteries still attached, or doing an oil change whilst having the engine running.

of course some of this might go a bit too far in depth for most of you, but hopefully this will set a good example of how things could be done :)

Prodigy195,news,1390611722.0,"&gt;Because it's a gunfight, and forensics can tell if the casings came from a possible angle from where the shots were fired.

What? How?  Watch a [gun being fired](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unh_RoCkjz8) and you'll see casing eject/land in a unique pattern.  The casings alone don't deterring the trajectory of a fired round. Just like in math you need two points to determine a line.  Casings ejected AND a target that has been struck by the actual bullet.

&gt;If they discover they were planted, and see whose gun they came from, or even if they don't know they were planted, they can find the gun range they were stolen from, most likely, and maybe watch tapes or whatever from that place. A lead is a lead.

Do you know how many people pick up brass at a gun range? Good luck determining who picked up brass to use in a crime and who picked up brass to reload or sell/give to reloaders.

&gt;Same if they stole a gun. If they stole it, and it is stamped, then they can find the gun owner, find out where it was stolen, and that's still a lead.

Criminals will file off the stamp just like they already file off the serial numbers.  It literally takes 5 minutes to do with tools you can buy at Home Depot/Lowes.


&gt;You don't watch crime shows much I'm going to guess.

Just...no.  Using crime shows in any capacity as justification for legislation is asinine.

&gt; You should support this and hope it works. Because if it turns out that the only way to reduce gun crime is to ban guns, then that's what will happen.

No I should not.  I support legalizing and taxing marijuana (even though I'm not a user) or providing a suitable living wage or revamping healthcare so that people don't have to choose between rent or seeing a doctor when they are sick.

I do not support any half-cocked, poorly planned, misguided piece of legislation that is easily avoidable by criminals and increases costs and red tape for gun owners.

Also, as another user posted earlier.  Maryland had a similar initiative where [gun owners had to turn in a spent casing from their guns to the authorities so they could be cataloged/registered.](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-06-18/news/bs-ed-microstamp-letter-20120618_1_casings-microstamping-technology).  The idea is that they could compare casing found at a crime scene to their casing database.  It returned a whooping ZERO convictions in 15 years of use.  Yup this is definitely a great use of state resources, gun manufactures warehouses, and gun owners money/time. "

First, I wanted to say thank you! I've been watching Tabletop since it came out and my friends are generally tired of hearing me rave about how awesome it is (hasn't stopped me yet though ;) )

I've played games like Settlers and Ticket to Ride before the show, but the show really brought out a love for them. Now, some of my best friends hold a weekly ""geeky board game"" day and we gather for a couple hours and enjoy some great games... This christmas was a total board game christmas (I added probably 10 or so to my collection - it was awesome!)

My question is (if you're still around) do you remember the game that really got you into board games? The one that kick-started your ""obsession"" if you want to call it that? 

For me it was Pandemic, even though I just recently picked up a copy (finally!) I""ve loved the game since I first got to play it and it really got me into board gaming more and more. (I'm even working on developing my own board game. It's slow going as I'm a perfectionist - but I'd be honored if you'd be willing to playtest it once I have a copy built)

BullNiro,feminisms,1390612212.0,"I think that you are missing the point of spectator sports and their position in capitalism if you think that.

Sports are big money industries at the top because viewership and attendance are so high, but only at the top. If people are not watching then the money isn't there. So the question is why do people not watch women's sports as much as men's sports?

This question is simply answered, because sport is entertaining not because of intent but because of the feats achieved — and in some cases it's also wrapped up in identity, but that's a long story. Men because of their strength are better athletes to watch in most cases.

So subsidies? What are they there for? Really there are 3 types: those for industry which keep money spinning teams in town, those for grassroots sports and those for athlete development. As long as the last two are dished out evenly so that participation rates are similar and there is a similar amount of spending per capita I am not sure that anyone can be too unhappy. If you aren't striving to end capitalism through social revolution then I am not sure you can really criticise industry on the basis they are doing what makes the most money.

There are strides in industry being taken though, slowly but it's happening. A couple of people I used to know played in the first female game of football to be played before an AFL match, the pro netball league has a good marketing pitch, the W league is on TV, women's tennis is as big as ever and women now get equal prize money in the grand slams (though some cockheads complain about it, but they don't understand prize money), women's athletics and swimming are taken very seriously by the public and the AIS. That's all just in Australia and I am sure that a lot of other places are making strides too.

So overall, I would say it's unavoidable in capitalism that sports like football etc have unequal pay for men and women, but it's getting better in all other aspects. My dream is that we will see more sports like ultimate become more and more popular: enforced equal numbers on competitive teams, still physical and fast but not too much contact."

Lodekim,weightroom,1390612218.0,"I think we may just be talking around the high bar/low bar squats.  My high bar is definitely limited by flexibility, and I have practiced it so little that I can't really make any comments on how different cues work.  With the low bar squat I can keep the torso more upright and avoid some hip strain by forcing my hips back.  The bar position is probably what we didn't get after (especially given how little ankle flexibility low bar requires).  "
