temp9876,BabyBumps,1389753531.0,"Well I guess on the bright side, at least you've got her conditioning you to be ""squicked out"" by it, which you're not, rather than intimidating you with how awful and hard it is?

I loved breastfeeding, didn't find it difficult, wanting to do it again is one of the reasons we decided to have another baby and not to adopt.  I was lucky enough to have a long line of pro-boob women conditioning me that it's just how you feed a baby.  Oddly enough, those lovely women are the minority in my extended family.  Aunts, cousins, in-laws, friends, acquaintances, everyone else was full of how difficult it is.  Like having a good breastfeeding experience is unicorn-scarce.

I am probably biased and judgy because I had such a good experience, but I honestly believe that these attitudes are the reason why almost every women I know in my generation has not been successful breastfeeding.  I never comment or question because I can only imagine how I would have felt if I had been unable, and I would NEVER poke that wound for someone else.  But I always wonder.  I've heard every reason under the sun from friends and relatives about how it just didn't work for them and it makes me sad.  I can't believe that this many healthy women with healthy babies were physically incapable.  Maybe lots of them just didn't want to, which doesn't bug me at all.  But I think a lot of them gave it up because they had been intimidated by the women in their lives.

Sorry I'm so wordy.  I guess I'm just trying to say hang in there, you're not alone."

johnny-faux,BasketballTips,1389753537.0,"So, I'm 6'2 as well and I used to have the same problems.  What you have to realize is that basketball is all about positioning.  Especially in the paint, that's where its most important.  You get the right position on someone, it doesn't matter how good they are, because you've already won.  
Okay, so what's the right position?  Well, to start off, the wrong position is  anywhere away from the basket.  You have to be close to the basket.  Also, you can't let your guy get in between you and the basket.  That means they have the position, and they'll win 90 percent of the time.  The best position to be in, is to be in between your guy and the basket.  That's pretty much boxing out, but its easier said than done.  
Next, you gotta use your height.  You're probably taller than most people on the court, or people are even with you.  Rarely will you find someone that dwarfs you.  So, most people jump at the ball at their highest jump height, but you can get there with more ease since you're taller.  So, I usually tip the ball up a little bit, (its out of reach for my guy) and then I grab it on my second jump.  Its easy for me since most people don't see it coming and they put all their power in the first jump.  Also, get a bit bigger.  You need power in the paint.  You can't be a skinny chump because everyone will just push you away with ease.  You have to learn how to fight for your position.  Use your body to get that guy out of the way.  
Hope this helps.  Any questions, just ask. "

I would speak to the doctors and nurses as early as possible, they know all about unwelcome visitors.  You can have them screen visitors for you or turn people away telling them you're not well enough for visitors.  You can also work with your husband on this, he can take baby out to the waiting room to say hello and make the excuse that you are resting or unwell.  

You should also be able to request that your boss' wife not be your nurse.  Just say it makes you uncomfortable because of your personal relationship if anyone questions, I think it is a pretty reasonable request.  Also, task your husband with monitoring facebook after you are admitted just in case.  You can squash any info leaks early.

1) I studied painfully hard most of the time and challenged myself in school.  To this day I think this is one of the most important things I did.

2) I didn't let failure get to me too much.  It got to me at times but I never once let failure make me quit

3) In college, I made it my JOB to study and do well.  Recreation came second, but I still made some time for it.

4) I did a good job saving money after college.  Having a well paying job helped (doing well in school really helped solidify my career).  I lived fairly frugally.  I could have done better honestly but I'm happy with what I did.  I did well enough that I was able to buy my own car and a house (20% down payment) all by myself at 27 years old.

5) A little late to the game (started after college) but I made it a point to figure out how to enjoy exercising regularly."

Like the others said, look up youtube videos. Easiest way! I also have a couple of recommendations: 

[This site](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout). It's not for SS, but if you click on each exercise it redirects you to a demo video of how to perform them,

[Also this](http://simplesciencefitness.com). Also has a couple of redirects to exercise demos.

And if you have a bit of time to spare your gym probably has a fitness consultant you can meet with for free to show you the ropes. I started out with one and she was extremely helpful.

As for the supplements - best advice is just to pick one. Keep in mind they're made for their protein content, don't get too sidetracked picking the one with more/less calories/carbohydrates/fats. Get one with a fairly good protein content and mix it into your shakes (if you choose to have shakes). Good luck :)"

 As far as cost of living and housing, that's one of the lifestyle choices. We could never do this in a place like NYC or San Francisco, for instance. If that was a priority for us, then I'd probably need to be working, but it's not. Our house isn't luxurious, but it's not really a fixer upper either. It could use some improvements, but its certainly liveable. There are actually a lot of afford able houses available right now. And the lack of student loans was deliberate as well. I got my Master's degree almost tuition free because I spent a YEAR applying for jobs at my university in order to get a tuition waiver. I had to work full time while getting my degree, but I paid very little out of pocket as a result. That was a choice in order to avoid loans.

Is there a source for this? because I have a really hard time believing that the IV's are anything near the II's both physically and mentally.

&gt; Couple that with improved armor systems present in the Gen 2 over John's (admittedly also upgraded) MkVII armor and it's not hard to see why one spartan lacking a helmet was able to murder elites willy nilly while unarmed and recovering from unconciousness.

Do you mean when Thorne escapes with Glassman? because in that scene he is absolutely abysmal. He would have been curbstomped by that elite, whereas a single II would have no issue stopping an elite, even sans helmet and shield.

&gt; Really, the Spartan IVs have all the strengths of the Spartan II program with none of the apparent weaknesses it presented both morally and financially.

Respectfully, I disagree. From everything we see of the IV's, they are nothing like the II's. it seems to me that taking the children at 5 or so and psychologically conditioning them is a LOT better than making an ego-toting jerk with improved armour.

the IV's are overconfident upstarts."

A bike costs less than a car, but does less. The car burns more gas but it can haul much more.

All these things go into an efficiency calculation.

It's like hybrid cars. They are fuel efficient, but are they **cost efficient**?

FYI, No motorcycles aren't. Sorry to burst your bubble.

Ps: you're excellent example. You've spent far less on mc's as on cars, yes? But how many miles have you traveled and tons (cumulative) have you hauled in those cars vs your various bikes. I also have a CUV that is marginally fuel efficient.

CrazyPlato,changemyview,1389755816.0,"I think the nature of your argument is that the technical constraints of that time forced music to be a social thing. It was something you did with your buddies, because one of you had a stereo and another had that sweet CD collection. I do agree that the removal of these obstacles has diminished the social quality a bit, but I disagree that it's ruined music as a whole. If anything, the way we listen to music has evolved to meet the new standards of technology. My personal favorite innovation is what I'd call ""stream of consciousness"" listening, as sites like Pandora automatically match similar songs to the ones you listen to. I've had moments where this proved incredibly entertaining, where I picked a song that I knew suited my mood and rolled from there. The intent wasn't that I know all of the songs that are playing, but that the songs continue to push the mood that the first song had. It allows listening to music to be a more focused activity, instead of scrolling through CDs and picking and choosing the songs that the artist made based on how they change (remember that many artists will put songs that are wildly different from each other together on a CD)."

The potential problem with using signets/talismans for fixing is that other decks may draft them as acceleration. The decks that most need the fixing won't necessarily get it. In addition, if you run a ton of mana artifacts, you tend to flood out a lot due to still needing to run a decent amount of lands in order to cast the artifacts.

CrazyPlato,changemyview,1389756183.0,"The problem is that, generally, you don't give right of way to the bigger, more dangerous person. That encourages drivers to ignore pedestrians, thinking that they should get out of the way and let them drive past. It makes accidents more likely, because the driver knows that with right of way he's able to defend himself in a court case and say that the pedestrian caused the accident. While I'm not saying that the change would turn drivers into maniacs, the thought that they'll be held accountable does give drivers an incentive to avoid making riskier decisions behind the wheel.

It's the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" argument. If a pedestrian causes an accident, the damage to the other party (a car) is a lot smaller than if a car hurt the pedestrian (with a great risk of injury or death)."

You try to rumage in your bags for an adaptor, but the search seems futile.  You then look for a way to record the video.  While you work your magic, you hear loud, but calm footsteps behind you.  ""Anything?""  The tall, grimy woman leans in the doorway.  

""Not a guddamn pixel is worth anything so far, but I'm seeing someone in the lobby right now.""  Her goggles are lifted, pulling back her thick, dark hair.  ""Should I check him out?""  You keep your eyes on the blur, ""No, no, no... uh... Look in my bag for an adaptor that's shaped like the hole in the metal box on the floor.""  You know that she would be shrugging, rolling her eyes, and sighing all at the same time right now.  The man had sat down and took something out of his coat.  His back is to you.  You are able to begin recording, but no adapter yet.  ""So whaddya think about this guy?""  You motion to talk with her, but you can't seem to pull yourself away.  He bends down, maybe to study his item.  ""All I know is that he's been following us for the past friggin day, and he's pissin me off.""  

""Found it!""  She goes ahead and connects the wires.  You used to love the waking sensation, the jolt of energy, the realization that you are one with a machine.  Now you simply flinch at it, but it does not slow you down.  ""Once I have enough footage, I'll download it.  Go and recon him.""  She was gone as soon as she plugged you in!  ""Don't be a fool!  See what he knows!  Damn...""  You grab a stale bagel from your pocket, and take a regretful bite, then you sit back, and watch her do what she does best.  The man must be hearing footsteps, because he puts his item back in his coat, and gets up quickly.  He looks behind him, for both of you to see your favorite girl get up from her crouch, and she lunges at him.  

She has him pinned on his back, but he is able to reach into his coat again.  As you lean in for what should be a better look, the monitor begins to crackle with the familiar snow of wear and tear.  ""NononononoNONONO!!!  Guddamn geezer!  Work!""  As you grab and shake the screen in frustration, the struggle continues.  For every second that the fight between your girl and the mystery man ensues, the static becomes more intense.  Once the screen is filled with snowblind, it clears up, but the two are nowhere in sight.  

You look quickly for the camera controls, and begin turning it.  Not a damn pixel is moving around.  You take out your walkie, and call her.  ""Babe, babe!  It's me!  What happened?  Did ya get him?  Babe?  Answer me!""  Not a sound from the other end.  You get up frantically and run out to the lobby.  The only evidence of their fight is a small crater in the middle of the floor, right where they were...  You run out into the street, and see not a single other soul for blocks.  You call out loud, ""Babe!?! BABE!?!?!  You out there??""  The echo confirms your fear, that both of them were far away, or they were not anywhere.  As you walk down the street, you hear an all too familiar sound all around you.  The sound of death.  ""Oh, fuck me."""

You mean like Kurt-051?  Or the myriad of Spartans killed by cloaked elites during the Fall of Reach?

And Thorne took out 5 Elites wielding Energy Swords while unarmed and helmetless.  That's Master Chief status right there.

&gt;the IV's are overconfident upstarts.

There are many Spartan IIs and IIIs (Emile and Sam-034 leap to mind, Linda too) who have the same ""look at how badass I am"" attitude.  There are also plenty of Spartan IVs with calm demenor (like, for example, Thorne and Palmer)  And because the entire program is voluntary there  aren't any recruits like Daisy or Grey Team, or the two spartans who commited suicide after forcibly escaping the program.  Overall the Spartans are a lot more mentally stable and are very professional in combat (see Demarco's willingness to listen to his team even as their leader, as well as Majestic's tight operation together despite being under heavy fire).

Plus damn near all the Spartan IVs we've seen speak are ex ODSTs.  Career military, by definition.  They're the best you can get without having a high risk of psychotic episodes and disassociative sociopathy present in most Spartan IIs.  "

You're defending the existence of ""de jure"" feminism, but ignoring the lack of ""de facto"" feminism: by law, women have the same opportunities as men, but in practice there are loopholes that are exploited that negatively affect this assumed equality (employers have the ability to choose who to hire, so if they personally don't like to hire women they are able to practice De Jure feminism by only hiring men, while still being within the letter of the law)

Somethings that come up, which shouldn't be impeding women in an equal society, include the lack of respect given to maternity leave (women are sociologically pressed with the role of mother, but are unable to further their career if they need to take time off for maternity), male-focused ideals for upper-level jobs (managers are expected to be ""aggressive"", ""determined"", and ""assertive"", but if a woman acts in this manner in the workplace she is accused of being inappropriate, sabotaging her ability to further her career), and so on.

r3v,rpg,1389757101.0,"We were playing a GURPS game in a scifi/space setting. A team of mercenaries doing dirty deeds for corporations, individuals, etc.  

Each member of our team was conceived (in the ""thought up"" sense, not the biological sense) very removed from the others.  Each member of our four man team was anti-social in his or her own way. If you break it down, I really think we had three sociopaths and a leader who didn't realize it. We had no team cohesion. 

It made for trying times for our GM. Fortunately, he was good-natured and quick to adapt. Likely the best GM I've ever gamed with. 

One time, he and our team leader went in the other room. They were negotiating a job.  And failed. They came out of the room and we had no job. Which meant that we had no adventure for the evening.  Our GM put a lot of work into an adventure and for whatever reason, our team leader and the NPCs couldn't come to terms. So, they came out of the room and the GM tossed his prepared adventure out the window and explained the situation to us. 

The rest of the night was some of the best on the fly GMing I've ever experienced. We spawned our own adventure based on one character's vendetta (one of his disads). It was a bit random, a bit funny, with wacky plans and great action. And all completely organic and off the cuff.  "

DukeCanada,todayilearned,1389757124.0,"Ugh...well no.

The American system is in the hole because of the cost of care. For one reason or another (And you could blame healthcare profiteering amongst other things) the American system charges significantly more for a procedure than any other system. an MRI in Canada costs roughly 150$, in the States it's over $1000. There's been a significant lack of collective bargaining and state bargaining with healthcare providers in recent history, which I think has contributed to cost inflation. 

Regulation is exactly what your system needs. There's merits to your system, don't get me wrong. For those who can afford the care, it's some of the best in the world in terms of access and quality. However, in terms of Universality, it's terrible. There needs to established laws which dictate how healthcare is to be operated differently than a regular business. First and foremost there needs to be more non-profit healthcare insurers and providers. This can only be done with increased regulation on the Federal level.

Also, the problem with having healthcare as a business is that it maintains the norm which is to provide an acute care based care model. We treat a patient for his/her issue, then charge for it. Americans (and Canadians, although wefson. We need to keep up with individuals and treat them before they're critically ill. This is inhibited because the fee for service payment model was built on the acute care model, which is now antiquated and ineffective.

Also, Americans are the only people in the Western world who experience the phenomenon of medical debt. It's an absurd concept, but this wouldn't end if corporatism was taken out of the picture. People who still have to pay for the naturally expensive or complicated procedures and may end up in debt. That's why I believe it should be paid for by taxes, not by citizens themselves. 

That being said, one doesn't need a single payer healthcare system. The Japanese and Germans found a way to make employer insurance work effectively. Switzerland uses a non-profit insurance based system. England, Spain and France have a mixed Single Payer/Private system. they're all doing quite well. There's no one answer, but I think the American system is more wrong than right.

Actually they're better.  Not only do they have more of them, they have a much higher survival rate.

&gt;The program was too expensive

Up until the failure of the S3 program and the success of the human covenant war allowed for the creation of a space ship so massive that it can hot drop frigates like starships.

&gt;They couldn't be as good because they didn't have the training.

They only missed out on about 6 years of training over S2s in comparison since near all of the Spartan IVs are ex ODSTs.  Which, as you may remember, had members who were so good ""truly if he was any better, he'd be a spartan""

&gt;He didn't get dropped from space, didn't kill a hunter like Kurt, etc

He killed 5 elites wielding energy swords while helmetless and unarmed.  He also managed to take on a cloaked elite and hold his own (something Kurt, unfortunately, could not do).  Also, his Gen 2 armor is easily capable of surviving space drop (as evidenced by Spartan Ops, where Gen 2 wearing spartans easily survive things that have killed spartan IIs in the past like orbital hot drops.  Malcolm 059)  He's also survived things that numerous Spartan IIs haven't, like banshee air assaults, heavy enemy forces deployed against him (see the fall of reach where numerous spartans fall to similar numbers of opponents) and cloaked elites with energy swords, and ambushes (just ask Grace-093, or Daisy-023, or Anton-044 how hard those are to survive)

&gt; We are all armed, and if our government started going house to house confiscating guns, there would be a revolution.

If they were to do it to everyone at once, sure.  They know that.

So instead, they pass laws requiring firearms owners to register with the government.

...and laws requiring that sales be reported to the government, so they know who owns what.

...and then they make certain classes of firearms illegal, and confiscate those.

...and then they make it illegal for certain people to own firearms, and confiscate theirs.

...and then they say ""if you have ever taken x medication, you are probably a danger"" and confiscate the firearms belonging to those people.

...and then they pass laws requiring exorbitant yearly fees to own a firearm, under the guise of paying for the victims of firearm crime, confiscating the arms of people who don't pay.

The aim is to restrict firearms ownership to the point where few own them, and the government knows exactly who they are and what they own.  When they come for those last ones, nobody else will have the ability to resist because theirs will already be gone."

Honestly, Whaling is not that big of a part of our culture or eaten that much around here. I personally eat minke whale once in a while (tastes a lot like beef) but no more than 2-3 times a year.

I however, like most Icelanders, can't see anything wrong with whaling. We do it sustainably, and I don't think it's any less humane than other sources of meat, considering that it takes hundreds of imprisoned pigs' lives to get the same amount of meat as one, free whale.

It's also a matter of principle. Iceland is a very small country which hasn't been independent for a very long time and does not have an army. We feel like our independence is very fragile so we resist foreign influence very stubbornly, even if it harms our relations with other countries. This attitude has worked [surprisingly well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars) so we've kept it."

She also was critically wounded by the sort of injuries that the S4s haven't even been slowed down by

&gt;Myriad of spartans killed by cloaked elites

They happen all throughout the books and comics.  It's a favored way to kill Spartans in the EU is to have a cloaked elite stab them in the back.  Thel Vadamm has also killed a spartan while cloaked.  Spartans have also died from things that ODSTs have survived (Cal died from a gravity hammer blade to the shoulder while Romeo has survived a gravity hammer blade to the chest) so Spartan IIs are also significantly easier to kill than Spartan IVs on account of technological improvements in Armor

&gt;the odst branch isn't humble

Now you know why Demarco and Hoya behave the way they do.  They're Ex-ODSTs.

&gt;improved enhancements

No I mean they actually had all the stuff the Spartan IIs had *and more* according to my source page for the S4 enhancements.  Not to mention their Gen 2 Armor is superior to MkV and VI Mjolnir Armor (as it's based off of Halsey's  MKVII plans like John's Halo 4 armor is, then improved on and built by independent companies) meaning that by definition S4s are superior to SIIs from a physical performance standpoint, and have almost as many years of training given the requirements for joining the program (essentially you have to have been an ODST first or displayed absurd aptitude in bootcamp)"

and second, this idea of ""tits or gtfo"" doesn't address the problem wherein girls who make indirect references to their gender are met with the same harsh criticism as girls who flaunt their gender for special treatment (i'm not saying those girls don't exist, i'm just not talking about them). example: i'm playing LoL and i'm afk for like 2 mins. i come back, my teammates ask me where i've been, and i say my husband needed help fixing a lightbulb or something. immediately, i get asked if i'm a fag and when i say i'm a girl, i get insulted, mocked, etc for being female. btw, this actually happened.

what i'm trying to say is - why should the default gender on the internet be male? why should i, as the victim in this situation, shoulder the responsibility to hide or lie about parts of my life so as not to reveal my gender and open myself up to criticism? "

Could they have made it that the princess wasn't in the castle because she got herself out and mario was on a wild goose chase? Sure, but it's a NES game and it's fairly hard to work in with a hero. Mario is not a game which has a message but just a game that trades off the old. The lack of ""originality"" in the ""story"" is because the writers are lazy, not sexist. Mario is barely a character himself.

If Mario deserves to be criticised for latent sexism in the narrative because of tropes that it's lampooning then does that mean you must satirise something from the femenist perspective or else be labelled sexist? Mario sets fire to and jumps on creatures from other species which pay him no heed, so shall we say that the game is about maiming animals?"

ajdeemo,DotA2,1389759749.0,"ok let's look at the slark replay

4:00 you try to manfight lycan and cm for no reason, and you should know that they can easily kill you with wolves. after all, he was level 5 with a double first blood. not to mention, you knew enchantress was probably there too.

5:00 despite going back to lane against a clinkz, you buy no extra regen, and you feed him a double kill for no reason

6:30 again, tp to lane with no regen.

9:00 go on nightstalker, feed him more

do i need to go on?

much as you would like to blame your teammates, you fed horribly in this match, and failed to correctly judge the strength of your opponents.

oh let's look at that faceless void game now

you random and start with gloves and some regen. getting more stats would definitely have been the better choice. you're a double melee lane against a broodmother, a stout shield would have gone a long way
 
2:00 you waste time chasing the brood all over. if you're as good as you claim, then you shouldn't be doing that because you know you can't catch her when she can move through trees. you won't be catching her at all by yourself without chrono, in fact. your loitering gave her a free double kill

5:30 you manfight the chaos knight. realistically, you're not going to kill him and in fact he's probably going to kill you. the reason this was one of the worst decisions you could have made was because you had no regen left. oh and let's not forget when the prophet tped in and killed you, because for some reason you didn't immediately back off.

and despite dying twice, you still don't buy more regen and save for a midas. why not just get treads and some regen at that point? or at least a set of tangos so you won't have to go back to base when you inevitably get harassed out of lane

because of this, at 9:00, you fed yet another kill since you lingered in lane at half health.
 
12:30 AGAIN you manfight the chaos knight, and you should know he's just gonna murder you. why don't you know better if you're so good?

again, in this match, you made some really poor decisions, and for some reason you're against buying extra regen when you run out early. i won't continue because beyond this point i'd just be repeating myself. and don't try to blame your teammates, they actually all had good scores by the end of the game, and might have won if it wasn't for you.

now, there's nothing wrong with having a bad game every now and then. it happens to all of us. hell, i've been on a losing streak lately because of it. but you still claim to be so much better and deserve a higher rating. let's be honest: if you were not the slark in that first match, would you have said he's terrible at the game because he tried to start fights that he couldn't win? and if the faceless void in the second match wasn't you, would you say he's part of ELO hell since he did exactly what the slark did, and also sat at half health most of the time? let's be honest: you would say these players are terrible, say they fed endlessly (whenever you claim that deaths don't matter), and say they're part of the reason you're in ELO hell


anyway, i'm not going to waste my time downloading a bunch more replays. you're a hypocrite: you judge your teammates, saying they have no idea what they are doing based on one game, but when someone judges you based on one game, you tell them it's not your fault"
sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389759758.0,"&gt;In practice how effective are those rules

As effective as people want them to be... so usually not very.  But then if you're say... Brazil, and you have tariffs on game consoles made outside the country, and so the price of a Playstation 4 is 1800 dollars, well, not very many people are going to buy it are they?  (At least relative to the 400 dollar price  point).  

&gt;follow up question, who gets the money from tariffs?

The government. Tariffs  were a major  source of government revenue for a long time until income taxes became popular as trade contracts significantly in wars... when you need money...

&gt;And who pays the cost of a tariff?

Ultimately consumers.  Tariffs are all different.  It used to be that importing electronics from the US to where I am and you could basically just record the value and then send it to the government at tax time, but cars it had to be paid up front.  That was decades ago though.  We  have mostly free trade now.  

&gt;Are there examples of when a country has come forward and said ""We refuse to pay a price that low!"" or is that when tariffs come into play/ what tariffs are for?

That's where tariffs come in.  Well, you can  outright ban imports too, but that's  fairly extreme.  

http://hts.usitc.gov/ is the US government page on the issue. 

An example of this happening relatively recently:

http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/eu-set-to-announce-anti-dumping-tariffs-on-chinese-solar-panel-imports-in-escalating-trade-row-210063421.html


This happens all the time with all sorts  of things, the US claims (probably correctly) that Airbus is getting state subsidies which would allow them to impose tariffs, Airbus  claims (less probably correctly) that Boeing is getting government subsidies as a defence contractor.  A Canadian and Brazilian company have been fighting over aircraft for ages.   The US and China actually have a mostly bilateral trade agreement, it's not a broader free  trade agreement.  If you're within the EU  the whole thing seems odd because basically the EU is a giant free trade zone (with the usually few thousand pages of exceptions that comes with everything EU).  "

&gt;Numbers aren't comparable

Thorne and Majestic engaged far more enemy forces during the events of Spartan Ops alone than Spartan teams did during Reach and didn't fall.

&gt;Even SIVs die in ambushes and surprise attacks

And Even spartan IIs die to things that ODSTs survive (Just ask Cal.  Romeo survived what killed her) so perhaps running off of ""survivability"" isn't the best measurement...

&gt;Children kicked the shit out of unaugmented ODSTs

Yea because he could already flip a tank.  As evidenced by the adults still being able to control them pre-augmentation, adults at similar strength levels could still take a spartan in hand to hand combat.

&gt;SIVs survive because of their armor

That's sort of my point.  Improvements in technology mean that the SIVs are better by default.  Gen 2 armor has greater augementation capabilities, lower profiles, and greater durability than anything the SIIs ever used (with the exception of John's MKVII armor in Halo 4) meaning that Spartan IVs in armor are stronger, faster, and more durable than the Spartan IIs ever could hope to have been.  And there are a lot more of them.

&gt;I don't get what you mean by expenses.

Well the SII program is automatically more expensive than the SIV program because the SIVs were made during what essentially amounts to ""peacetime"".  They were made during the huge economic boom following the re-expansion of humanity which means (just like anything expensive during an economic boom) the cost of their production is less damaging than trying to produce cutting edge armor with never before explored technology while in the middle of a war with a technologically superior genocidal opposition.  I mean compare the cost of NASA's space development to that of more modern space travel...creating something entirely new is always going to be more expensive than just improving what already existed.  So even though the Gen 2 armor is *insanely* more powerful than the MK V or VI Mjolnir (given its ability to do things like survive oribital drops, enter slipspace unshielded, and the like) because it's an evolution rather than a revolution, and it's during a peacetime economy boom, it's never going to put as much hurting on the UNSC's budget as the SII program did."

psychicsword,todayilearned,1389760242.0,"Well the thing about the US is that you actually have to sell your value to get things like extra paid time off. As long as you have 5 years of experience getting that 3rd week is typically very easy and if people tell you otherwise it is because they are the kinds of people who never negotiate. When I was first hired at the company I work for now I had just graduated from college. I had as little leverage as people could possibly have. I had some internship experience but not much and they didn't even know how hard I worked. Even so I negotiated myself a $2k raise right off the bat and a $3k signing bonus just because I told them I didn't think I was being paid enough. Since then I have worked hard and received over $20k in raises and bonuses over my original offer and they gave me an office. My coworkers that were hired around the same time have received about $1k in bonuses and a single raise of about $3k and are stuck in the cubes. The people in the US that can do that, show leadership potential, and shine make it huge in the US and the people who instantly accept everything at face value end up with 2 weeks of vacation even though they have worked in the industry for 10 years.  The trick about the US is to be ambitious like you are approaching a girl out of your league."

Just ew.

Because everybody deserves to feel comfortable in their own skin. And it's her money to spend. And with the right fitting bra, the straps won't dig 'painfully into your skin', or cause you 'discomfort while running or playing sports' (ask /r/abrathatfits). And people are going to stare creepily whether you have big boobs or small boobs. And if she was going around telling people with small boobs they should get breast implants to look better, that would be reinforcing society's message that women are only valued for sexual appeal. 

She wants a nice set of boobs. Big deal. What's stupid is trying to make her feel like shit for wanting to feel good about herself. Not everyone is happy with what they've got, and it takes a shitty person to look down on others for having insecurities that they want to fix."

Sharkictus,TrueChristian,1389761385.0,"When some of the most noted and famous of the founding fathers are known for threesomes with french prostitutes and his illegitimate son (Franklin, also a deist), being Unitarian who edited the gospel to take out anything Supernatural Christ did (jefferson), one who did attend church but refused to take communion and when asked about it, stopped going to church, and had a more pantheistic sense of providential destiny (Washington), created and wrote a treaty saying we aren't Christian nation (John Adams, despite it being voided, it reflects the man), and one attacked institutional religion, called the 'god of the old testament' wicked, and entire bible 'the pretended word of God' (Thomas Paine)...I would be hesitant to say our Founding fathers were Christians.

They were not as far gone as our cultural elites now, but were still heavily influenced by the 'enlightened' Scots (who in turn were not as far gone as the French and their...'enlightenment'), but still far gone. The majority people were more Christian, (though I would argue this during lowpoint of behaving like a Christian, earlier settlers were far more Christian, and revivals later gave the culture far more Christian behavior).

Since I see PvZ here, Kingdom Rush is supposed to be a pretty good port of a very popular mobile tower defense game. If they like puzzle-y type of smaller games you could pick them up Puzzle Quest, Clash of Heroes Might and Magic or Long Live The Queen. 

Also if they are your friend you might just want to go for something you can play together, like Borderlands 2 or pick up any of the free to play MMOs and just level up together. 

If they seem like they might be impressed by some artsy games you could try to go for some of the big name indie titles. Thomas Was Alone is pretty accessible. Or get them the current humble bundle?

Willravel,TrueAskReddit,1389761961.0,"How do I view it? Through my futurescope, like everyone else. 

In 2064, it's likely the United States will have undergone a very slow evolutionary process. 

Politically, it will still be considered a center-right country relative to Europe and the emerged Southern Asia, but not as much as it is now. There will probably be a two party system, with the Republicans clinging to policies which the Democrats of today espouse, while the future left will be closer to what we consider far left progressives of today, those fighting for fundamental paradigm shifts and fighting the next civil rights causes, in addition to all of the old ones. I would hope, by then, the general consensus of the country will be that the gender binary and orientations fill a large, equal spectrum, so we're not foolishly wasting time fighting over who can and cannot marry or have equal treatment under the law, as if, somehow, the Equal Protection Clause is unclear. Abortion will likely still be a hot-button issue, but it won't be a 50/50 fight anymore, as the slow decline in religiosity will have impacted the pro-life side, leaving it only to culture warriors and the more inconsistent folks who self-describe as Libertarians. This United States will be less able to flex its military muscle, but will likely still be struggling with new forms of the national security apparatus asserting itself beyond any reasonable boundary. Drones will be the default military hardware for most of the developed world, in fact it's very likely by that time drones being utilized domestically will be a fact of life. What's the point in the police putting men in a helicopter or construction being done in a dangerous area when the job can be done by an automated counterpart of some sort. Unfortunately, it's very likely drones will also be abused by those in power. Congress will be full of idiots, because we're still stuck in the paradox of campaign finance reform being the key to getting a good Congress, and a good Congress being the key to getting campaign finance reform. 

Socially, things will also have slowly progressed. Based on current projections, the United States may not be a majority Christian nation by that time. Between apostasy (such a fun word) and the spread of Islam, it's likely we'll see religiously then what we're seeing racially now, as whites are becoming just another minority. Christians will be hoarse from decrying their decline, but it will likely either be preaching to the small choir or will fall on deaf ears, as most people simply don't care. 

They'll be more engaged with the newer forms of entertainment and digital interaction. If you've seen *Caprica*, the *Battlestar Galactica* reimagining prequel, I think something like that is in order, a shared/social interactive holographic interface, immersion into a digital landscape. It will start with consoles, and its utility will quickly lead to it becoming the next big thing after the internet. I fully expect Reddit to be like this, with avatars acting as physical representations of all of us as we interact, share, discuss, and flame. Games will utilize this perhaps to its fullest, but the triple-A games will still be poorly written, for the most part, making the technology more flash than substance. C'est la vi. 

Food and water should be quite interesting by that point. The US population in 2014 is north of 300 million. By then it should have grown by at least half to about 450 million, part of a global problem of trying to run a planet with something like 12 billion people on it. This all could have been avoided with adequate international education on and availability of prophylactics, but history's greatest lesson is that people are fucking stupid when it comes to sex. Monoculture of grains will have left the United States in an unbelievably dangerous position, a position exacerbated by our few species of food being fully protected by patent. Two, maybe three companies will control absolutely everything we eat, so it won't be too different from today, but what will differ is that monoculture will mean we're at significant risk from our everything-resistent superbugs. All it will take is for one fungus or bacteria to mutate just slightly, and it will devour every ear of corn that Dow chemical patented and owns. A side effect of something like this might be that we finally stop taking Iowa seriously during elections, and we can all agree that Iowa doesn't matter again like sane people (sorry, Iowans, but California should clearly be the most important state in national elections). Basically 100% of our food will be farmed, and it's not going to be pretty, because the oceans will be dead, which leads me to...

... the entire planet will be an environmental disaster worst-case-scenario. The oceans will be basically lifeless, forests will burn, we'll start to see the culmination of the current mass extinction event we triggered, and we'll be in the early stages of what has already I think been coined as ""Venus syndrome"". The global climate change positive feedback loop will have progressed too far for us to do anything meaningful about it. We'll have the normal warning signs, like stronger storms, global temperature increases, radically fluctuating weather, and they like, but the forecasts provided by the scientific community will read like the book of Revelations more than *An Inconvenient Truth*. 

Years later, someone will get it, though: transcendence via digital migration. We won't be able to engineer the Earth to ourselves, so we'll have to engineer ourselves to be in a more resilient and less restrained form. The amount of cooperation and investment necessary to reverse climate change will be more than we can muster, but moving your consciousness into a technological framework can make us immortal. 460°C surface temperatures in 500 years won't matter, because our servers will be deep underground and our consciousness will be able to either play in the digital playground here or move into drones which have left Earth to explore the stars.

This is true for a number of reasons. Most obviously, the price of goods and services are not proportional to the cost of labor impacted. Wages tend to ripple up gradually after a raise in the floor wage. Market toleration of increased prices tend to tamp back the rate of change in prices as well. The extra cost of employment tends to be spread among various parts of the equation.

Chicks know what they're doing down there more than men do. But I like what you do! You're doing a great job!"" Nobody (who isn't a cuckold or into humiliation) wants to hear someone's ex was better than they are, and only sociopaths and the inexperienced in love think it's a good idea to tell their current partner the way it actually is. Unfortunately, lying to a significant other about their sexual prowess is all too common. It's a simple way to boost their ego and what are they gonna do? Call your ex and compare notes?

I am in no way defending this viewpoint or claiming it as my own. I'm simply stating that it's the only way to justify God's actions in the old testament.

Obviously you'd need to help him with that but it's a good way to help him see the need to be grateful - and kids tend to love going to the post office and mailing stuff. Mine always do, anyway. While you work on them you can have a chat about gifts and why we give gifts at Christmas: they aren't earned, they're bestowed out of love.

Next year have him make a list. You guys pick a few things off the list to get him - and set a budget or a specific number of gifts (we do a large gift, a couple medium ones, and a couple small ones) - and then pass the list around to relatives. You could also suggest that people buy him books or games or outdoor things like a t-ball set.

The government could quite reasonably charter a company to manage spectrum for it, or it could hand ownership to subnational entities or the like if it wanted to. 

But then you get into interference.  If I have a cell phone in a particularly frequency range, and you have a satellite transmitter  in the same range we have a problem.  So you need some sort of mechanism to ensure that each chuck of spectrum only goes to one task at a time.  Having your cellphone not work between states, or worse, not work on borders of  states, or having companies basically fight over control of the spectrum by trying to overpower the other guy would be... chaotic.

Just because something has high acidity and/or low pH, doesn't mean it will always taste tart. You know how you can make a food *taste* less greasy by adding in some acid of some sort? The fat/grease doesn't disappear, it's just that it's less noticeable.

Similarly, cola has an incredibly low pH, but you don't normally notice it because of all very high sugar content, the carbonation, and all the funky flavors that are added in. 

I don't think the quantitative measurements you get from objective unbiased instrumentation will translate well to the subjective perception of taste.

1up-,AskWomen,1389764145.0,"I really like this book. I remember reading Paper Towns a few years ago and I liked it ok, but not all that much, and I couldn't finish Looking for Alaska (eventually I did go back and read it, and it's now my favorite). So when my friend was all over TFIOS, I was a little wary, but decided to give it a go, and I'm really happy I did.

A lot of people are saying they don't find Hazel and Augustus relatable or believable, I loved them. I'm a huge book nerd and spend a lot of time alone, when I do hang with my normal friends, I do feel very much Different. However, when I'm with the right people, we do fire off fairly witty conversations full of obscure references. Also this is a book, if they had average conversation I would find it boring.

I wasn't a huge fan of Van Houten coming at the end, I understood why it was necessary, but I just wish it was handled differently. 

I was really surprised when Augustus died. I saw the signs, when he was at the Anne Frank House and was in pain, I had to put the book down for a moment and actually said, ""John Green, if Augustus dies..."" Which obviously wouldn't help but still. 

I liked that Hazel was going to for sure die, they just didn't know when and Augustus had a 90% chance of living and then Augustus died. It was a nice flip flop.

I would certainly recommend this book to teenagers, I feel a little old for it, being 20, but I can see why it's a huge hit for it's intended audience."

1. Know what you want from women. (Relationship? Marriage? Harem?) This will help know which women to pursue.

2. Know your boundaries. This will help you not to tolerate bad behavior from women.

3. Have a real moral code for yourself. This will help you to be assertive when a woman accuses you of wronging her and you really didn't.

So there you go. If you are already nice, and just add these three things, you'll be assertive without being an asshole. Of course, that won't stop women from calling you an asshole, but that's their problem."
Inkshooter,AskHistorians,1389764843.0,"What is your definition of 'person of color'? I'm personally not a fan of this term, as all it is is a contrived way of saying 'non-white', which is a very nebulous category itself. Are Persians people of color? What about Jews?

As for whether or not non-Europeans lived in Europe during the Middle Ages, it was not unheard of for darker-skinned people from the Middle East to live in Mediterranean port cities in Europe such as those in Italy or Greece. In fact, Sicily, Crete, and even much of Spain were all directly under Muslim rule at at least one point in history after they were conquered by invaders from North Africa and the Middle East.

While not impossible, a person from Sub-Saharan Africa (I'm assuming this is the group you're asking about) would have little reason or means to travel to Europe, as direct contact between the two regions didn't become commonplace until the Renaissance, and was mostly limited to trading even then.

Racism as we know it today is relatively new, at least in the Western world. Prejudice was frequently over culture (especially religion) rather than appearance. If a person from Mali were to go to Europe, Europeans would most likely dislike them not for being black, but for being a Muslim. An Ethiopian would likely be considered strange and foreign, but they would be more readily accepted due to being Christian.

pamplemus,AskMen,1389765272.0,"well, although he posted the image in a thread about gaming, the picture isn't specifically talking about that; it's talking about girls being on the internet in general. so i do think the race blindness analogy applies. but even with gaming in particular, assuming everyone is a straight, white male has very real consequences. it fosters an environment where outsiders are harassed and that behavior is considered acceptable.

even if i'm not flaunting my gender, i still take issue with the fact that i essentially have to hide something so meaningless about myself in order to protect myself from harassment. like, it's not a huge amount of trouble to say ""my SO"" instead of ""my husband"" or to not correct them if someone just assumes i'm a guy, but i don't think it's right that i have to do that so i don't get comments about them cumming on my face or whatever. why is the onus here on the victim to change and not the people who are victimizing others? that's not acceptable in any other context - why this one?"

Since I've decide to go for the lesser amount of RAM, I've decided to go for the i7-4770 and change my motherboard to H87 series instead of Z87 as I don't plan on overclocking, so I save some money there.

As for the SSD, I have also decided to go for the 120GB option as well. I double checked over everything that I want to put on there and it definitely won't go over 60GB, which saves me about 30-40GB to put on in the future.

CloudDrone,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1389766032.0,"You're absolutely right. 

I personally rarely post my music in the feedback threads, but every once in a while I spend half an hour critiquing music. 

I don't feel the constraints of trying to be ""nice"" and afraid to step on someone's toes, but if I'm telling someone their music sounds like shit, I'm using less creativity than the beginner who made a song, who was actually trying to build something out of the pieces of knowledge they have.

Every one of my responses is brutally honest, but I'm just not an asshole. Everybody is on a different path in music making and I recognize that its not the place to tell someone they can't get that song any airplay. They point is to take what ever they have and make suggestions for how they can approach it better in the future. We all have holes in our experiences in music. 

It takes infinitely more creative thinking to take a shit song and describe ways to approach it differently and make it better than to tear down all of the ways it sucks.

Creatively critiquing others music and describing what you would do to make it better helps your own creative process."

The old adage of ""either you trust your admins or you do not"" is applicable here, because admins are just that - they own the box as much as you do.

As a consultant, I usually use situations like this to explain why administrative rights are so problematic in any environment you want to keep even somewhat locked down.  Specifically in this example, you can allow users to install applications so you do not have to manage this, but you will still end up managing something (nonstandard and hard-to-manage hacks, specifically).

I *think* in movies one take on it is that in movies there is this concept that white men are the default because people are so used to them that they somehow ended up as the great neutral point. And the idea is that women will watch moives made for male tastes, but not the reverse. Just like black people will still watch mainstream/white movies but white people are unlikely to buy a ticket for a movie specifically targeted for black audiences (like all those Wayans brothers movies). 

As awful as all those Twilight ripoffs are they seem kinda like Hollywood struggling with the idea that there are enough women with enough disposable income that you can make movies specialized just for them.

Steaming_Noggin,leaves,1389766597.0,"If I had to guess, I'd say that smoking helped to mask all the rage you were already feeling these past few years - the rage was always there, it was just muffled and pushed away in the fog. Now that the fog is gone, the emotions are just where you left them. And if they stem from real shit in your life and in your head, they're likely not going to just go away easily. That's an obvious-in-retrospect lesson I learned - nothing actually gets dealt with by smoking.


In my experience, after I quite smoking (about 30 days so far, so I'm no expert at this...) the see saw of raw, unblunted emotions that I'd been trying to hide from was very extreme for the first few weeks, but it's getting easier to manage. Like others have said here, seeing a counselor or something may be good if your rage cycles don't start to even out. 


Reality is a fat bitch quite often, especially if you've had more than one human's fair share of crap dumped in your life.

If the focus was the policies and actions of government rather than the people governing then people would understand what is actually going on.

Hell, I would even argue that changing leaders every 2-3 months would be great. It would stop the current leader from abusing their power and shifting focus to what is going to line their pockets. Instead the leader of the time would just continue with keeping up the main directive of the party since they won't have time to make any significant changes to benefit themselves.

Also in todays day and age, why do we not have a government based around people voting for/against individual policies online? Hell, why don't we even vote for our PM and parties online when election time rolls around. (There are secure ways of doing it, trust me I've been in network security for quite a whiles now). I imagine it as a non mandatory voting system, that way only people who are truly interested will vote for and against. For example: the NBN would have a policy voting page to which people vote for or against, people who are invested in seeing infrastructure grow would vote for, and people who want to see growth halted will vote against, and people who don't care will not be considered because they don't care enough to vote either way."

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389767035.0,"&gt;that all of her male counterparts are pursuing??

Yet how many games actually cater to that mindset?

&gt;don't have fantasies about about being the ridiculously hot chick with a great rack 

Look at what the women look like that star in Twilight style Movies or Soapy supernatural tv shows or romantic comedies or look at the heroines of casual games or heck even the women in make up commercials ala Neutrogena. Most of them are still white thin and beautiful, but how many of them actually look and dress and act like the depictions that video games get criticized for. 

If you want to see what women (or at least a large enough percentage of women to make up a target audience) fantasize about looking like look no farther than the movies that are actually made with them as a target audience. They heavily suggest that women are still looking for sort of default beautiful but still a lot more ""young smart professional"" or ""approachable girl next door"" or ""oh noes! she's so beautiful without being aware of it/without ever doing anything for it (including not dressing for it)"" over ""hot, sexy, sultry sexbomb"". Not that there's anything wrong with hot, sexy, sultry sexbomb but to act like that is the only or even the main female fantasy is kinda blue eyed when the evidence around pretty cleary points differently.

Whether any individual person cares doesn't really matter, but the  industry obviously seems to assume it matters and matters to the extent that if affects buying decisions because otherwise we wouldn't get stories about games being pressured not to put their women on the cover or not have female main characters in the first place. 

Just look at the casual games marketed targeted at women and what their percentage of male hero only, female hero only or either/or/blank slate is compared to other genres.

When my class ended my friend came to walk me to my next class because I was a little on edge. And what do you know the ex showed up and was walking with me. Making a huge scene.

OswegoWriter,AskReddit,1389767873.0,"That there's a difference between happiness and fulfillment.

Even though I'm a Super-Secular Buddhist, I used a story from the Gospels about giving. Jesus and his disciples are watching people donate coins to the treasury, and all the rich people are throwing heaps of gold into the pile, but then a poor widow comes along and throws two copper coins on. Jesus makes his followers take note of this; in fact, he specifically says that she gave the most out of all of them because, even though she was poor, she gave what little she had in order to help others.

There's also a Concordance connection to a verse in Ephesians which states, ""Let him who steals steal no longer; but rather let him labor, performing with his own hands what is good, in order that he may have something to share with him who has need."" I actually just found this a few minutes ago when I googled the story above (gotta get those details right, since my memory is shit), and it really ties in what I hope that my kids took from this story-- and, being a Buddhist, I left it up to them to puzzle out the meaning. The idea I hope they take away is that, by their own sweat and effort, when they earn something and turn around and give that to someone in need, it's pleasurable in a way that eclipses happiness: that is fulfillment.^1

[^1 YMMV, This is not a guarantee.]

I work in the nonprofit sector helping those in need because that's what gives me fulfillment (not necessarily happiness, but fulfillment). Jesus was a smart cat, and even if I don't agree that he's the Son of God and the path to salvation, I think he's right on a lot of stuff, especially when it comes to serving others. And I use this story to demonstrate that difference: the rich people make this gift because they're already happy, and it's very likely that giving this donation also makes them happier; but the poor woman gives because that act of selflessness fulfills her."

That's just it, given that we have a 1950's - 1960's feel this Americana feel would *not* be replaced. The US had tremendous influence in this era in Europe. You'd see a different face of the Americana - the one that played out in foreign nations.

If your answer is yes, don't do it. You go to different schools, and you've only been together for three months. I don't know if that seems like a long time right now, but in ten years, it's going to be a drop in the bucket of your love life. Going to different schools may also make him feel more at ease with sharing your texts by way of bragging to his buddies because it's not like it's at your school, right? But it's still *your* reputation. 

It sounds like you have good instincts. Not going on cam and not sending dirty pictures is incredibly wise. There are numerous ex-girlfriend porn sites where disrespectful shitheads post private pictures their one-time-loves sent them, and while I'm sure he doesn't seem like the type to do that to you right now (and may very well never be), *media never forgets*. I'm thirty and there are exactly zero naked pictures or videos of myself in existence, and any guy who tries to obtain such from me is dropped like a hot sack of shit. It's comforting to know I never compromised myself like that for anyone and therefore no one can ever use such a mistake from the past against me. 

On the other hand, I've sexted with boyfriends before. Boyfriends I trusted very much but still acknowledged there was always the chance they'd screenshot our conversations and show them to their friends, or worse, the internet. While I'm not as thrilled about doing that as I am about having a spotless no-nudes-or-cam record, I don't really regret it, either. People in general aren't as interested in sexy texts as they are in sexy pictures. *Only you can determine what's best for you in this situation, because only you know what you will or won't regret.* If you feel hesitation to do so, **don't do it**. If he pressures you to do something you're not comfortable with doing, he isn't worth being with and certainly isn't worth giving your virginity to. Define your self-respect, make sure he understands what respecting your boundaries means in no uncertain terms, and listen to your instincts. 

He's in high school; he's going to be horny. But that doesn't mean you have to compromise yourself to make him happy. If it feels like you're compromising yourself, **don't do it**. If he can't handle and respect that, well... you had a good three month long run together, gained some experience, learned some lessons, and will hopefully be ready to hold out for someone who *will* respect you and your boundaries. Those guys do exist, there are plenty of them, and in the long run it will definitely be worth waiting to find one. 

Hope it works out for you either way, and that you hone your already good instincts and follow their advice. "

The fundamental difference is that the economy is still centrally planned, vs respecting the existence and emergence of local, regional, national and international markets, while encouraging global competitiveness for domestic companies and industries instead of trying to fix the domestic economy so that foreign investors can never be market leaders.

State socialism, like market capitalism, works best when an elite political class call the shots. Indeed, both work better when the trappings of democracy are abandoned. Market socialism on the other hand necessarily entrenches the principles of democracy in all aspects of public life, from the ballot box to the workplace."

While there's a lot of solid ideas such as not pedastalizing and seeking validation from women, understanding relationships should not be built on idealism, developing a frame, standing up for yourself, self-improvement, and taking charge of your life, with the exponential subscription of internet tough guys, the sub has descended into a circlejerk of ""alpha vs. beta,"" lame-ass field reports (oh wow! You got her number!), examples of women behaving badly and men behaving beta, and *argument after argument* against feminism and how it's destroying society. ""Feminism and betas amirite?""

In short, it's largely become a circle jerk of bitterness...bitterness that for a lot of guys is *completely justified*. However, repeatedly expressing and rehashing bitterness does not help you overcome it. Reading TRP just made me angry at myself and others. Once I absorbed the useful information, it was time to focus on leaving the anger behind.

The take away message is that the reality of inter-gender relations isn't the fantasy you were told to believe, but it isn't the kill-or-be-killed melee many TRPers portray it as.

Usually a vehicle/bike is given a salvage title when something happens to it, like an accident and the insurance company deems that the repairs are too costly (usually about 3/4 what the vehicle is worth) and decide to salvage it.

The thing about salvage title vehicles is that they may have underlying damage you can't see. And generally you can't trust it. People are going to argue with me on this and say that even though it's a salvage title it could still be a good dependable bike, and that's true.

UlgraTheTerrible,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1389770808.0,"That is actually *really* uncommon, but it can happen. And by ""that"" I mean what *probably* happened was that you had a delayed cycle *anyways* (ovulated a bit late and thus your period would've been late regardless) and maybe were only *just* pregnant when you first tested (you need to be implanted for about 20 days or so before the tests get accurate... 

See, a lot of people don't know that sperm can live for about five days (some say a week or more) in the uterus and that further, it can take about four or five days from being fertilized to getting implanted... So technically, you can be not *exactly* pregnant up to about nine or ten days after having unprotected sex. 

I'm not saying it doesn't happen. In fact, my post was more to illustrate the absurdity of asking the internet if you're pregnant. "

There's a lot of studies about how driving tired is equal to driving when you've been drinking, to certain degrees like a day without sleep is equal to tipsy or something along those lines. It'd come up on a Google search I'm sure, but anyway, I don't think that just because you have been drinking means that you're automatically not fit to drive. I think we should be able to be trusted to know our limits. 

Unfortunately, people are idiots, and people don't know their limits because there's such a stigma about alcohol that no one drinks regularly enough to learn, just like you said about the parents - teenagers thing. 

A lot of people on this thread are making it entirely black and white, like the media has taught them, and that's just simply not true. You can't ban something because people might be stupid with it, but you can punish people for being stupid. I definitely agree that someone should go to jail for a very long time if they're driving drunk and kill a whole family, but I don't think that someone should be punished because they were simply driving over the limit, and not doing anything else wrong.

AKA_Sotof,Games,1389772552.0,"&gt;This is true, but we can make educated guesses. As I said before we do know that Europe was busy fighting over oil and we do know they were at war with each other. From there being a war like that, we can make an educated guess that it would be far fetched that one or more of these nations that were currently at war with each other set up something as extensive as to mirror the Vault-Tec Habitats/Shelters/Social Experiment Housing. 

Europe houses a lot of nations - some with natural resources and some without. Denmark and Norway for example would lose their oil fields almost immediately, and if they are not invaded by Germany in a strange WW2-esque imitation then they would have plenty of incentive to build vaults or something like it. Switzerland is also a good bet for a vault-builder.

I also think the rest of Europe would have incentives to build vault-like-bunkers simply due to the elite knowing what is coming. The resource war means total annihilation and it means nukes - they would have prepared like the US, even if they were busy fighting. Remember, the US was busy fighting as well even if it was relatively isolated.

&gt;Though I do agree with your assessment of it being too risky. Can't kill that golden goose while you still have so much of North America to explore.

Exactly. Also the reason why we'll probably never see Fallout: Resource Wars. Too risky."

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389772699.0,"Except, as a female player why would you want to play in a gameworld that reminds you how shitty the real world is when you are just there to have fun? As a female player you have to play in a harsher world just so dudes can learn a meaningful life lesson if they were choose to play an optional female avatar? Despite the fact that a female player, who doesn't need that life lesson because they already know what it's like to be female, is much more likely to pick a female avatar than a male player? 

Sounds like you are actually punishing people for picking female avatars by making their world less fun to play in. 

Especially in any kind of fantasy setting where magic exists (aka physical strength is less relevant) it makes little sense that the same cultural stereotypes would exist. 

Everybody has their own take of more female perspective in games, but I would rather have it be - at the core - about giving male and female players more equal opportunity access to fun/interesting games and stories that appeal to them rather than the main goal being to teach dudegamers a lesson about respecting women or how hard the lives of women are. Because I bet that would get really, really boring from a female perspective after a while. 

As far as I'm concerned, realistic cat calls have roughly the same standing as realistic toilet breaks or wound infection. There are some games where simulating that would make a lot of sense/would actually add to the game, but in most games the rule of thumb would be why on earth would you want to simulate the parts of life that are fundamentally not entertaining.

3DGrunge,videos,1389773324.0,"&gt;I feel you're an idiot for believing you have it so bad, you think I'm a self hating douche (which is fucking funny as hell because I'm not). We won't see eye to eye on anything. However, a couple points you made I will address:

Learn to read.  Nowhere did I say I have it so bad.  I think you are an idiot and I will address why I believe such.


&gt;You talk about men taking risks a couple times in your response. My question is, how is this women's fault? Even if you take out the working longer hours, being a risk taker leads to dangerous jobs. This counters your point that these are the jobs that are left because men will still choose those jobs because of their risk taking behavior.

Mens rights has nothing to do with blaming women for anything.  The fact you believe so is evidence enough to prove how retarded you truly are.  Learn to read you imbecile.

&gt;Like I said before: get married, have sex, then have kids.

Yet feminism is enforcing the single mother aspect of life.  Strange eh?  Why should women be empowered to be sexual while men must remain dormant until marriage?  Why can't they both be sexual?  Oh right men are evil rapists and the only ones who do so.

&gt;I'm sorry if you knocked some one night stand up and had to pay for your fucking kid. And yeah, I get it, you want the right to say no, I didn't ask for the kid, I don't want to pay for it, but do you know what your dick is for? Its for urinating and making babies. You don't want kids, don't have sex. Simple. As. That.

Strange when that same argument is made against women it seen as sexist.  I myself am married and do not have children yet.  I do know a man however that was tricked by his then wife who claimed she was taking birth control and punctured his condoms.  He is still paying child support for this child and has limited visitation rights due to her claiming that he assaulted her after their divorce.  The charges were dropped when she admitted it was a lie because she was upset.

&gt;A guy rapes a girl and finds out she's pregnant, he would then be legally allowed to block her abortion. That's sick, but it will be the loophole you create.

A felony would give the man no rights over the child.  How fucking stupid are you?  Are you 12 or just an idiot?


&gt;Really? I'm going to call out some names, which are obviously the byproduct of being in positions of power not available to women (because, you know, men had more rights back then) Hitler, responsible for 5.9M dead jews. Stalin, responsible for 13M dead russians and other soviet bloc nationals. Pol Pot, responsible for 1-3M dead Cambodians. But you know, these are national leaders, using proxies to do the actual killing, but still this is most heinous of all evils in my opinion. The next most heinous of all evils? The murder of one's own child. My most hated people who've done this are Susan Smith and Andrea Yates. both women, shockingly.

Lets call out some names.

Queen Mary I of England and Ireland.  Mass murder of protestants.  
Queen Elizabeth.  Lets see mass murder of Catholics and the and a bank roller of the slave trade.  
And lets not forget Catherine the Great and her many accomplishments of mass murder.

Look men and women are capable of evil acts that is what I am saying since you are incapable of reading.  And many woman have been in power throughout history and some say hold more power than the men in the spotlight.

&gt;Lastly: You don't understand how good you got it being a man. I don't even understand it sometimes. You're stuck in your stupid myopic first world view of being a man. You have not one single idea of what it's like to be a woman in another country, hell even one in some places in this country.

This has nothing to do with any other country.  This has to do with equality in one country.  In other countries the issues are far different.  Stay on topic and learn to read.  

&gt;You have no idea what its like to be second class, to be ridiculed, to be handed things (because frankly, I'm happy we as men have to work harder than women, it just means we earned it.)

Men should need to work harder and women should not be given things because they are looked down upon.  That is exactly the fucking point you moron.  Learn to read.

&gt;To be delegated to pushing out kids and be a slave to your husband because he ""worked"" so hard.

What is this the 50's?

&gt;You have any idea how many men think their wives ""don't work"" when they're stay at home moms? How would you like that, work all day long come home and have your wife tell you how good you got it because you didn't do anything all day?

Being a stay at home mom is easy work.  My mother and wife criticize women that say it is hard work.  I would love to sit at home and program all day while looking after some kids.  However my wife and I would rather both make money and pursue careers that do not afford us such opportunities at this time.  She will not let me solely be a stay at home dad and refuses to be a stay at home mom.  Sorry.

Now if that person is the only one doing all of the cleaning and cooking than yes it is hard work.


&gt;Yeah a Patriarchial society you myopic piece of shit.

Yup blame men because you are a sexist self loathing idiot.  I am sorry that your gender makes you so angry at yourself and that you are not allowed to be proud to be a male due to society saying it is wrong.

&gt; I didn't call you or any one of your kind names, in any of my responses, because I'm a bigger man than that, but by asking for the right to kill a child or to not pay for your child's care, you took that will power away.

You are an idiot and a liar who is incapable of reading.  Impressive.


&gt;its T-H-E-I-R you moron.

Oh shit a typo.  Holy fuck.  If you actually learned to read you would find more than that one typo.  By the way this alone proves how much of an ignorant little piece of retarded shit you are.

She may never be. I've met fifty year olds with the same amount of sense. 

You're dropping her, right? Going no contact? That's one of the best things you can do for yourself at this point. Even if she cries, even if she begs, *don't let her back in*. For your sake, OP.

So love yourself by cutting her clearly toxic presence out of your life altogether, and permanently, *please*.

Read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" for simple but life-altering tips on going from socially awkward to socially awesome. Join OKCupid or another dating site and message people in your area whose profiles indicate they're considerate, thoughtful types. Put an ad on craigslist's platonic section specifying an interest or activity that you'd like to do with someone (playing chess, learning to play go, rock climbing, trying out dive bars - whatever) and when you've made a friend or few, get to know their social circles or directly tell them you'd like to be in a relationship but are having a hard time meeting eligible girls. Find events in or around your city and go to them. Figure out where people you'd like to know hang out, and start going there yourself. Smile, be friendly, practice the art of good conversation, and before you know it your social circles will increase and your shot at meeting someone worth being in a relationship with, unlike your ex, will become easier than you'd previously thought. 

And whatever you do, don't bitch about your ex to the girls you date, or devote yourself to any of that super creepy pickup artist bullshit. You sound like a good guy with a level head on your shoulders, and a woman worth having will both see that and encourage it in you - not make you doubt yourself.

ESO is the same way. Anyone can tank, but that does not mean that every player can just throw on tank armor and be a tank; in order to be a tank you have to spend time leveling and spending respectable number of skill points in the Heavy Armor and One-Hand and Shield skill lines. If a player does not commit themselves to being a tank then they will not have the experience or unlocked skills to do it on the fly.

GW2, on the other hand, does not even have tanks. Some classes have a bit more defenses than others but group content was designed so that no one is taking hits from bosses.

Ultimately, you should not have to worry about anyone asking you to tank or heal because if you don't offer to do so then you probably don't have the necessary skills."

Silent-G,AskReddit,1389775866.0,"NO, YOUR OTHER HONOR"
WC_EEND,LongDistance,1389775873.0,"some tips I have:

* Fly during the low season (ie: early January-March/early April for the northern hemisphere, July-September for the southern hemisphere, depending on local climates as well ofcourse)

* Try to fly on a route that has different airlines on it. Different airlines means more competition which means lower fares (generally).

* Book on a Tuesday, this has something to do with how the IATA flight schedules refresh and then fares are cheaper.

* Sometimes having a connecting flight can work out cheaper than flying direct (this is referred to as hidden city ticketing, where flying A-B-C is cheaper than flying A-C) edit: for transoceanic flying, this is somewhat less applicable, but sometimes works as well, check this before booking direct flights.

* Stay on the lookout for deals and mistake fares (they are rare, but they do exist and airlines usually honor them)

* Have a limit and say ""once tickets go below &lt;x amount of local currency here&gt; I'm buying them"" and then do so. Similarly, have an upper limit too.

* Look into alternate means of getting to your destination (does not apply for transatlantic/transpacific/transcontinental LDRs). If your LDR is, say Amsterdam to Paris, look into high speed rail instead of flying (or if you like torturing yourself, an Eurolines bus).

* Airlines use a complex fare structure, try and have a basic grasp of how it works. At the heart, there are 3 classes: Y (economy), C/J (business) and F (first). Beyond these, there are other booking classes (with a letter from A-Z). These letters have different meanings with different airlines too. D can be non-flex business on Air Canada, but semi-flex economy on Lufthansa for instance. Now, why does this matter? All of these different booking classes have x amount of seats assigned to them. The trick is to grab the seats that are in the lowest fare buckets (because they tend to be cheapest). Expertflyer and applications like KVS availability tool can help you find these seats (though this is already fairly advanced stuff).

* Join a frequent flyer programme (do some research on which one gives you the most for your miles) and stick to flying the airline/alliance of your FF programme. Depending on how frequently you fly (and how far), the miles will start rolling in and soon enough, you'll be able to fly for free (or upgrade yourself to seats in the pointy end of the plane).

* As a rule of thumb, 4 months to 6 weeks prior to departure, the cheapest seats tend to become bookable. 

* Finally, determine what savings are worth it for you (ie: is a 12hr layover worth saving €100/100$? That is something only you can decide.).

That's all I can think of right now, will edit if I have more."

Also, word to the wise, don't fret too much over college classes. Someone who pulled mediocre grades in high school, or consistently struggled to stay at or above the B+/A- line might have more trouble with the transition, but if you were consistently pulling A's (or A+'s) in high school in the hardest classes they offered, your transition to college -- at least academically -- shouldn't be *too* difficult. You're still graded on your understanding of the material; the only real difference is that tests are worth more and there are fewer (sometimes as few as two) of them. 

**TL;DR** honors classes aren't all that different from normal classes, and there's no need to be scared of college classes, though that feeling is perfectly normal. "

AkiraZXE,truegaming,1389777456.0,"So, at first I wrote a massive essay detailing the major points brought up in the ""sexism in games"" subject and counterpoints for them. However, I realized I was wasting your time, my time, and every reader's time. Instead, I have an idea for those who believe games, as they are now, are generally sexist. It's something far more productive than arguing on the internet.

r/Truegaming designs a (hypothetical) game.

The game will have a female lead. Ideally, if it has a large cast of characters, they should be reasonably varied at the very least. The female characters should all be believable. Since the phrase ""women's issues and points of view"" inevitably get invoked in this subject, the game should touch on them in some way. Whether it be lampshading or the focal point of the story, they should be there. The game should not be a parody, after all, it's a serious attempt to make a non-sexist game, with the intent of reaching a female audience.

The game should basically receive far fewer complaints of sexism than your average game.

The idea is, if games are sexist, what would a non-sexist game look like? On top of that, what if we catered it towards women? I've actually brought this up with a number of people and I've never gotten a serious answer, or even realistic ideas. I don't mean to say that everyone who takes an issue with something should necessarily come up with the best possible solution, but if there are so many people who believe that gaming, as a whole, leans towards sexism, then enough of those people together should be able to come up with a reasonable idea of what they want to see. Not just ""there aren't enough women in games"", or ""I don't like how these women are depicted"", but an outline of a game that meets their expectations. If that can be done, we can draw comparisons and have real discussions."

royalsiblings,incest,1389778206.0,"To say I'm not kinky at all is definitely not true, and if there's incest-fantasy in the mix I get much more into something.  (That is, for example, bondage generally doesn't do anything for me, but if it's brother/sister then I'm suddenly interested, and so on.)  But I suppose I'm a bit vanilla on the surface, or something. I'm most attracted to the wholesome girl-next-door type (i.e. more likely to see teaching preschool than at a biker bar), but it seems these are not the sort of women that go forums like this, or fetlife or such.  (I'm sure they do and just more anonymously, but it's much easier to find men or the more sexually promiscuous women--which is totally fine, just not as much as what I'm turned on by.)  So if I met that girl-next-door and in bed she's secretly a kinky bondage incest loving vixen, all the more for me! I can work with that. But I tend to be intimidated by and/or turned off by the more dominate personality types that do show up to those sort of places. So even when I do meet a woman, it's often not a woman I'd be attracted to, lol.

Which I guess is a bit rare, as I get the impression most men are a bit more ""I'll stick it in any hole you give me"" and I'm more like, ""But do you like dogs or cats more? Are more Gryffindor or Slytherin?  Where do you want to travel together?""  And on top of that she's gotta be attractive to me and be into incest... lol. It's no wonder I'm still single, huh?

A few of my friends tease me with a vague love for incest. Like, they know I think Luke and Leia should've hooked up in Star Wars, and that I enjoy some of the couples in Game of Thrones more than others, but they don't know how deep it runs.  Do you think your husband would freak out about it?  It seems, looking around the internet, that men are far more into incest than women, but I wonder if that's just because society allows for men to express sexual desire/deviance more than it allows women to..."

milkymoocowmoo,AskReddit,1389778689.0,"I used to work with this cute girl named Sarah. Short, quirky, curly red hair, a slightly larger than average bosom...yeah, she ticked all my boxes. Never took a run at her because I was in a relationship at the time, but we were still pretty close, flirted a bit and usually sat next to eachother in the office.

Anyway, one day she starts talking to me from her desk (next to mine) about where we would go to get lunch in a few mins. Nothing wrong there, right? Well at the time I was sporting a semi, and just happened to be wearing these overly thin cargo pants over equally thin boxers. Still not really a problem, but you know how sometimes when you realise you have a semi, it evolves into the full bone? Yeah. At that moment Sarah came and sat on the edge of my desk and continued talking to me. She was wearing an outfit that day with a rather open neck, and instantly I copped an eyeful of her fantastic cleavage. Soon enough I was fully torqued, and somehow I was sitting on my pants so that there wasn't much space in the leg for Milkymoocowmoo Jnr to grow. Not to toot my own horn here but let's just say I lucked out in the genetic lottery in that area (toot toot), plus I was circumsized a few years earlier and the scar tissue formed a noticable ridge just behind the head. That plus the tight thin pants meant that all my dick-details were clearly visible through the material and if she had've looked down there would be no denying that it was my erect penis. I might as well've just had it hanging out, that's how obvious it was.

What was I to do? She was hurrying me along to get lunch but I was hardly in a position to stand up and walk anywhere. I wheeled myself in under my desk as much as I could to hide it and just stalled for time until it went away.

Considering that I later found out that my GF at the time was cheating, I wish I could go back to that moment and ask Sarah to meet me in the stairwell in 5. She was a little bit kinky and probably would've gone for it. :("

Perhaps a brief discussion about the problems/myths of inbreeding? 

You might consider adding a wikipeida link to GSA under your ""Why am I attracted to incest"" area. I think you've got a couple different groups you're talking to--those who are into the fantasy of it and those who are actually attracted to/in relationships with family members. I think most people here are into the kink/fetish, but it might not hurt to provide for both, especially considering some people might be coming here from a non-kink POV and going, ""... what the fuck is this?"" lol.

Links to documented incest in history/media might be nice, both in the human realm and animal realm. Especially to show how it's common in some animals, and historical. (Not to mention Biblical.)  That could be a whole undertaking of its own, but I'm always fascinated to read that sort of thing.  Right now this forum feels very fetish-special/heavy, and if that's how it's intended to be used, it's of no consequence, but I'd love to have a community of awesome people of all sorts of interests and walks of life--who also just happen to get really turned on by incest.

You have to earn eternal life, be given it for a good life.

And if we do not have eternal life from the get go then hell (or a furnace as mentioned in the bible) is not a place of eternal torment, but a place where you burn for your sins then stop existing.  it makes sense that God wouldnt allow people to be tortured forever either, being good and all."

But that's what it always is with me when I go on a spree. Generally takes some major sitting down with myself to figure out what's bothering me... Last time it was vaguely ignoring how my boyfriend can sometimes say incredibly hurtful things without meaning to.... (I tend to be oversensitive to rejections, which I *know* and thus *ignore/repress* when I feel that way which apparently isn't so great)

However, while I'm not formally educated in psychology (meaning I have no degrees) I would suggest it's actually pretty damn obvious even to me that the whole ""not caring"" about the relapse is kind of an indication that there's something rather major going on, because honestly... 

This is a condition that will impact your social life, the way people perceive you, etc. For you *not to care* that everyone is going to notice something major.... It kind of indicates a cry for help from a deep subconscious place. I either don't know you well enough or am not educated enough to tell you what that cry for help is about, but... I think it's probably supposed to be a wakeup call. 

I think it might be time to see a doctor and have a talk. It could be depression (apathy is actually much more common than feeling actively sad) and it's really important to remember that depression often has *nothing* to do with how awesome or not your life is... Because it's just an imbalance in brain chemicals, often quite easily helped with a simple antidepressant, though maybe a psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist might be a good person to see."

jonesybear,baseball,1389780375.0,"I'll say the same thing I said to a friend of mine who said the same thing... Bad thing is, in my opinion, I doubt EA even tries to land any MLB rights and bring back MVP. There's no chance in hell they could even come close to getting exclusive rights like they have in the NHL and NFL, and I believe PGA, markets and that's normally what they're all about. Though MVP was good in its time, once Sony got the rights from 989 Sports, it was game over for EA. And then their whole debacle with scrapping NBA Live altogether because they were willing to put out a horrible product and 2k had been working their asses off to make their product better than EA, I believe it was '11, and EA got reamed by critics. With those, they've shown that if they don't have exclusive rights anymore, in the sports world, they aren't willing to try to publish a better product than what is already out there. So even though there is a slight chance because 2k is dropping their claim to rights, chances are they don't even try to get back into the MLB market because they aren't going to attempt to beat ""The Show"". That would take many, many years to do."

This can also be taken to mean that the person usually looks great. Everybody has bad days; that's normal and human.

&gt; It also is a completely useless comment...

If I'm asking if you're tired, I'm doing it to sympathize with how you're feeling and also to not ask you to do something strenuous or to be understanding if you choose not to join in on an activity that requires a lot of energy. It is intended to make sure that I *don't* make you feel guilty or down for being tired and potentially less social when we're hanging out.

If asking if you're tired is bad, how else should I understand that you're having an off day? If I wait until I actually ask you if you want to join the rest of us for watching a movie or something, you're still going to end up saying no and that you're tired and then feel guilty about it.

GarbaGarba,AskWomen,1389781414.0,"I'd say that it's probably less known than the pill or IUD. You don't really see Nexplanon commercials on TV. 

I got the Nexplanon implant on October 31st, so it's been almost 3 months that I've had it. I wanted to try it because I had some crappy side effects with the pill, like more pronounced anxiety and depression, a lower sex drive, etc. I originally got on the pill because of my horrible bleeding and cramps and it was a godsend for a few years, before I realized that I was a hell of a lot more anxious than I was previously.

The implant has a lower hormone dose, and I've noticed huge leaps and bounds in terms of my side effects. My stress level hasn't changed but I handle it much better. I didn't get the IUD because it's a blind procedure, as in they can't really see where it's going when it's being inserted. My injection site hurt for a day or two and bruised pretty badly, but within a week, I was fine. 

In the three months that I've had the implant, however, I have had spotting. Not anything major, I wear a panty liner and it's more than enough to keep things tidy. It hasn't really affected sex or anything, as it's so light that it's almost not noticeable. It's just kind of there. It has been getting lighter and lighter over the last couple of weeks, though. When reading about the implant myself, I read a lot of anecdotal things saying that people would spot for up to six months before their bodies got used to it, and my doctor told me the same thing. 

I was notoriously bad at taking my pill on time as well, so that was a big reason for the Nexplanon. I'd recommend it to anyone, but it is a very personal choice.

antisocialoctopus,Parenting,1389781564.0,"I taught swim lessons, including ""water babies"" lessons, for about 15 years.  It's part of water adjustment for babies.  There really is no swimming properly without being comfortable getting your face wet.  If your child is unhappy or frightened by it and you keep dunking him / her underwater, THAT would be cruel.  As things typically go, there will be lots of you holding kiddo close while you do little bobs until they're used to being in the water up to shoulder level or so.  That progresses to pouring water over their head (and them pouring it on you to make it a game) and blowing bubbles in the water.  It's only once your child is comfortable in the water that any dunking underwater should be done.  Even then, if you're nervous hold kiddo close and just barely go underwater with them so they can see that you're not scared.  How you react to it all will determine a lot of how your kid reacts. I think a bunch of people have already mentioned that if you blow in kiddo's face, they automatically hold their breath.  Keep in mind, it's nothing prolonged either!  We're talking under and immediately back up until they're used to it.  After that, passing (pushing) kiddo underwater from one parent to the other is pretty natural and kids seem to enjoy it.  

There is no research on it because nobody researches the best way to teach swim lessons, to my knowledge.  It's the norm for lessons, though.  If you want your kid to learn how to swim, he / she has to learn how to go under and get their face wet.  They can't give permission at that age or fully understand what's going on, so you help them through it.  "

You already know of her burst potential and her all-in nature, which is why she's incredibly terrifying to deal with when she starts snowballing. Otherwise, she's essentially a pretty meek meat shield if she can't get the power necessary to be a threat.


What, IMO, one of her biggest problems is her escape mechanics. All other energy champions can utilize their dashes/mobility mechanics in ways for offense and defense, depending on the situation, and can get them as early as level 1. Akali has to grab hers at level 6, and even then it can only be used offensively. Were there some mechanic such as the dash being usable on allied targets but requiring at least 2+ charges and resetting the charge timer, I think it could push her into LCS screen time.

RoyalBlueSky,summonerschool,1389782995.0,"Mained Ashe as my very first champ and do well with her in Solo Q. Hope I can give a few helpful pointers.

* Go W-Q-W-E, then priority is R&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;E. Your W at early levels is a great zoning poke, and the CD gets shortened to 4 sec at max rank so it's in your best interest to do so. Don't spam it so much that you go oom, though. It should be used often but not TOO often.
* She's deceptively difficult to play well because of the high mechanical play you can put into her (kiting, orb walking, ult accuracy).
* You will likely lose with her a lot. Her lack of any mobility/escapes is what makes her very easy to catch out, especially if she has no ult. The more you play with her, the better you inevitably get at knowing the times when you should pull back to avoid ganks or to get out of harm's way by anyway that can pop you in 3 hits.
* She's predominantly a farming champ, so CS is (as it is on all ADCs) the highest priority.
*Ashe is known as the queen of kiting, because of her two sources of constant slow as well as a stun that can last up to 3.5 secs when used from long range. This means you will need to practice how to maintain distance from threats that want to jump on you. Best way to learn is to try whenever possible, even when you die a lot.

------------

Specific ability tips:

* Q is a toggle, so only use it when you are hitting enemy champs for more than just harass. Chasing or running away from champs always warrant usage of Q being toggled on. Using it on minions is a waste of mana, so avoid this as much as possible especially if you tend to forget you still have it toggled (like I do every once in a while).
* W should not be spammed, but you can afford to use it often to maintain threat and dominance to enemies that want to try and chase onto you. Be careful of going OOM when using W too much.
* E, being essentially a free Clairvoyance every minute, should be used to check dragon and baron when you see few enemies out of the fog of war. But, you can also use it to check areas covered in the fog. Better safe than sorry.
* Your ult is global, so trick shots are indeed possible. Until you can get very good at predicting enemy movement, I don't recommend practicing this often in actual games. If at all, do it in practice bot games. The better and more reliable usage is to initiate a fight or keep CC onto enemies from a close distance.
* A guaranteed crit from your passive, when stacked fully, should always be used on an enemy champ if nearby. If you need to prevent losing gold from a minion though, might as well gain gold out of using the crit.


I hope any of this helps! Best of luck to you with Ashe. She's a pain at first to learn because of her glaring weaknesses but over time it becomes very rewarding to make plays with her."

But it doesn't seem very effective to theorycraft like this at the moment since we don't know exactly how the later skills affect things, or how weapon abilities scale vs. spells. Also, balance issues like magicka vs. stamina dps can be changed very quickly, and is likely going to be one of the last things they worry about since it matters a bit less at launch than, say, game crashing bugs."

He'll now do whatever it takes to silence you, he'll shout, wild out, wave his arms around, call you names- whatever it takes to put you off ever talking about his behaviour to anyone ever again. And he'll blame you for it. He'll tell you that it's your fault he's so angry. He'll tell you that you look at other men. He'll tell you that you flirt. Eventually you'll hear it so much that you'll start to believe it, you'll agree with him because you cannot bear another argument. You'll stop trusting yourself. You'll spend hours rationalising all the hurt and upset and confusion that he's causing you. You will lie about your relationship. You'll pretend that it's good, that he makes you happy, that he loves you.

And then, one day, you'll wake up in an abusive relationship and you won't know how you got there.

It certainly helps that you have an Irish passport, but Norway is not in the EU, so the only thing it makes easier is that you don't need a work visa should you find work here. You still cannot just stay here for more than 6 months without getting a permission from the immigration office. As a freelancer the immigration office would require you to provide proof that you can provide for yourself while in Norway, as well as customer contracts, budget, etc. You can find all the documents you would need [here](http://www.udi.no/Norwegian-Directorate-of-Immigration/Central-topics/Work-and-residence/Work-and-residence-EUEEAEFTA-citizens/Temporary-registration-system-for-EEA-citizens/).

If you cannot prove that you can support yourself as a freelancer, you can only stay in Norway for 6 months as a job seeker. After that, you need to either leave the country or you can register as a ""Person with sufficient funds"", provided you have enough saved up money (more details in the link above).

The market for your profession is tough in Norway. I'm not an illustrator myself, but I know for a fact that it's not a field that is in great demand, and it will be even tougher for you if you don't speak Norwegian. Still, if you are exceptional at what you do and have an impressive portfolio, you might just catch someone's eye."

The refugees are overwhelmed and swim down the river. The warrior is also shocked, but notices something floating in the water. His eyes open and he sees the river is entirely red with blood, and the wet, muddy banks are slick with it. He loudly announces to the people that they’re being tricked, and one by one they start to see the truth. Most of them scream and panic. The warrior looks around and notices there are strange, terrified men, not from the refugees, hiding in crevices and holes, blank with fear as they look upon the prophet, who has begun to slaughter all around him. The warrior draws his sword and jumps in to fight him, and appears to have the upper hand until he is thrown aside, giving the prophet the chance to jump into an icy hole, emerging at once as a giant, maggot-drenched beast.

Don't be afraid of tanking LFR - if you've done the fights - go ahead and jump in...

Most of the fights in SoO are just tank swaps - so basically ask the main tank how many stacks to swap at and just taunt when they get that many stacks. The way I keep track - just focus the other tank and watch their debuffs for when to taunt. I recommend - especially if you're at a lower gear level (entry/LFR gear) make a macro that says:

/rw Taunting %t now   
/ra Taunting %t now

this just lets the healers know you are taunting (I believe DBM or another addon has the ability to do this as well. (I usually do it in raid warning, in LFR as a tank you should automatically be assist, if you're not just ask to be made one)

Quick fight overview from tank's perspective:

**Immerseus** 

Taunt at 1 stack of corrosive blast. You can't stand next to each other - it's a breath aoe. Also make sure you're moving out of sha puddles, personally I pick a platform and just move back and forth across the front of it (kinda of like a typewriter) Once you get to his 3rd/4th split (depending on DPS) you won't need to taunt anymore for the most part (he won't cast the spell more than once)

Dps the little adds when he splits. Cast AMS for some free runic power when the little adds blow up.

**Fallen Protectors**

You'll be tanking either Rook or He here. If you're tanking Rook, just make sure you're pointing him away from the raid, and pick up Misery when the adds come (most LFR groups don't even worry about tanking adds, but it's a good habit to get into). Rook will stun you and punch, you want to make sure you Death Strike shortly before this and he won't even eat through your blood shield usually. If you don't get off the death strike, you should still be ok, just hit it immediately after. If you really need it - IBF breaks stun (should work here, but never actually had reason to try it so don't quote me on this).

If you're tanking He, things are a little different. Make sure you move out of poison on the ground. When he goes to cast gouge (if you have DBM, it will alert you and your screen will flash reddish) you need to turn your back to him. This will prevent the gouge and he will punt you forward a few feet. Then just turn back around and continue tanking him. He will also shadowstep behind you sometimes, just turn around and face him (I find myself moving around a lot when I tank him). You should also be picking up the 2 non-gloom adds (I forget the names - misery and something else?) 

For both bosses, you still need to be inside the bubble for dark meditation - for He, just face him towards the raid with your back to the raid, putting him outside the bubble and you right inside (he has no frontal aoe or anything to worry about). For Rook - try to place him so the raid is beside or behind him (depending where they are stacked) and yourself just inside the bubble facing him at least alongside the raid (some people might get hit by fists this way, try to minimize it if possible)

**Norushen**

You'll be swapping at 3-5 stacks. In LFR, since the ""portals"" to get cleansed are random, make sure you're paying attention in case the other tank gets ported. Also, you should try to have the cleansed tank on the boss as much as possible. Once you're cleansed as the tank, try to make sure you're picking up the orbs that drop when the big adds are killed, you getting back more of the debuff isn't a problem like it is for the DPS...

**Sha of Pride** 

I've ALWAYS solo tanked this on LFR. If you're tanking - turn the boss so you're standing in front of the prison (he will only use one of them on the tank side on LFR) and just step backwards onto the glowing thing when someone is prisoned) I usually have the offtank just go DPS here and stand up front with me to help with prisons

**Galakras**

Your best bet here will be tanking the bottom until you're more comfortable with it. For the bottom, grab the adds and group them up to die. Drag them down the hill a bit and the NPCs will help (the AOE is a good spot). I tend to drag whatever adds I have up to the demolishers so that they can be cleaved down with the demo as well. 

If you're tanking the towers, after the Demo dies, you'll run up the tower and get aggro on the adds, you need to move out of the ability the guy on top does (forget the name - it's a ""titanic smash"" type ability) so you don't get punted off the tower.

For the boss himself, swap at (I believe 3) stacks and make sure you point him away from raid.

**Iron Juggernaut**

Fairly simple tank swap, you'll need to run in and out. Make sure you tank him somewhere that you won't get punted very far, and the raid has somewhere to stand that they won't get punted far either (let the other tank choose if he's done it before). 

**Kor'kron Dark Shaman**

This one is interesting for tanks. In LFR you generally just 2 tank this. Each of you take one of them, and at 3ish stacks of the debuff from the male one, you swap targets. Takes a little coordination (might want to use the macro above). While you're taunting back and forth, you will also be moving the bosses around as well to get out of AOE

**General Nazgrim**

Simple tank swap. Taunt at 4ish stacks of sunder. Don't listen to groups that say you should be getting the adds in between swaps - the swaps happen to fast for you to be running around collecting adds (especially with the DKs limited mobility to begin with)

**Malkorok**

uses a ""titanic smash"" ability. In LFR you can almost ignore this, but it's good practice to be moving around the boss to avoid it anyways. No need to swap or anything here

**Spoils of Pandaria**

This might be my least favorite fight to tank. People will think you're going to slow and open boxes for you. They will screw you up in every way you can imagine. Just go with it. I generally try to open a couple small boxes with a boss or a couple medium together. Keep doing this and it'll go down. You'll get into a rhythm eventually. You'll be taunting a bit on this as well as people will get excited and open the boxes for you. Try beforehand to cut this off by asking people to let you be the only one to open, hopefully they listen to you.

**Thok the Bloodthirsty**

Tank swap at 3 stacks. You can't stand with the other tank - you need to run in and out to swap. When he's in his phase where he's focusing people - go tank the jailer and stay out of the boss's way. Easy fight to tank. In the final phase make sure you're moving him around to get out of fire and give the melee room to DPS.


**Siegecrafter Blackfuse**

You're going to taunt every time one of the big adds spawns. When the other tank taunts off you, you're going to run and pick up the add. DPS the add yourself, and put it in the bad stuff that spawns in the room (fire works best IMO, but the blades and such work fine). Try to get the DPS and such to refrain from hitting the magnet so you have saw blades to work with. 

**Paragons of the Klaxxi**
There are pairs of these that shouldn't be tanked together. Honestly though on LFR, just pick one, and when yours is killed, taunt the next one to come down. Generally you'll be ok. Ask the other tank for help - I don't remember offhand the exact order here (it doesn't matter all that much in LFR what order you tank them in - you should be able to survive anything they hit you with)

**Garrosh**

If you're on the boss, tank him in the middle of the room. Run out of iron stars - tank swap on the later phases when he's putting up the debuff on the tank. 

If you're doing the adds in phase 1, you want to group them up, then sit them where the iron star will be (gorefiend's grip helps with this a bit) without being in the star yourself. For your first few times at least, I would glyph Anti-Magic Shell for this fight, that way you take 0 damage from the star, you'll just get punted. EVentually you will get a feel for where to place them that they get hit but you don't.

For the ""teleport"" phases, just hit up the other tank and work out who's going left or right and stick with that


Hope this helps you feel a little more comfortable!

Can't look at talents/glyphs from work, but you're welcome to look at mine if you like... some of the things I run are personal preference (like runic corruption) but it's a good starting point...

For your last question I have a weakauras string that actually tracks my blood shield and my death strike estimated healing for me. I don't happen to have the link here, but I'll try to post it when I get home from work (it also does runes and other important CDs)

Feel free to hit me up if you want some more help - I'll help out as best I can!

have fun tanking!

It's called ""The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive"" and it's pretty brilliant, to be honest. 

But the thing is, you may find many successful people reluctant to ""out"" themselves. The stigma is still heavy enough that it is a risk... How *would* the general public react if they found out that their mutual funds were in the hands of someone who had a predilection for spending recklessly? 

The thing is, and the elephant in the room that many people refuse to see is that *we do tend to go nuts sometimes* and the sad reality is that *possibility* is often enough to make stuff like employing us to do jobs that require a great deal of responsibility an obvious risk.

phaqueue,wow,1389788177.0,"There are only a few situations that drive me crazy in dungeon finder... pet growl is one - for that I usually just stand back and watch as the pet dies. I'll only pick up things headed for the healer, if it's headed for a dps or the pet, I leave it go. If a DPS dies and complains that I wasn't tanking - I then tend to point out ""well the hunter pet is tanking, not me, blame them"". Usually that gets the point across well enough that a vote kick comes shortly after (this is of course after telling the hunter to turn it off - always done in party not in whispers so the rest of the party is aware I asked nicely)

For DPS pulling - I have to agree with the others, I pull way too fast for anyone else to be pulling things. Try pulling faster? It does take some getting used to, but a good way to judge is your healer's mana. If you end a fight and your healer is at full mana, you're probably fine to pull more and faster. If your health doesn't ever dip below 90%, you're definitely fine to pull more. If you're not using your cooldowns (not sure what ones you have by that level) at all, you're also likely fine to pull more.

If the DPS are ""tanking"" mobs off you - let them have the mob. It's not best practice once you get to higher dungeons, but at lower levels where you're at, most DPS can tank the stuff long enough to kill it with little problem.

I just leveled a warlock, and I would outright tell the tank. ""If I pull it, I'm fully prepared to tank it until it dies. If you taunt of me, thanks, but if not no big deal"" 

Heirlooms make it much easier for DPS to be able to survive, and most things won't last long enough to matter anyways. Just try to get into good habits and pull off as much stuff as you can from them, and leave them the rest. 

Kind of off your topic - but a couple helpful hints...

I'm a big proponent for glyphing consecrate in dungeons while leveling at least - it makes it targetable (like a DKs Death and Decay) and it's really nice to just put a consecrate where your healer is standing when adds run in, they will generally run to the healer, hit your consecrate, then about face and run to you. 

Get used to using your cooldowns now. You will be using them a lot at 90. As soon as you get it, start trying to use it whenever the opportunity presents itself. Don't worry about not having it for later, save LoH for yourself (that's your real ""oh shit"" button right there) and use the rest all the time. (smartly of course, don't pop a cooldown when the mobs are at 5% health just because it's back up)

My grandfather was quite a man. Born in 1918, he took a job after the war as a Harvard policeman, once protecting JFK and twice stopping riots as they happened. He knew every student's name, and made a point of being approachable and kind to each one. He lost two sisters to fire, and his wife to cancer, and so raised seven children by himself; and though he lost much, he always lived modestly and was thankful for what he had.

I remember sitting next to him in those last days, his eyes closed in prayer as the priest wore on. I never told him I was an atheist; I believed it would accomplish nothing, but he - an octogenarian whose marriage had been blessed by Pope Pius XII - would have thought me ineligible for the bliss for which every Catholic hopes. I would simply listen politely, observe my grandfather's gentle breathing, and think, ""I can't wait until he's older and more mature, so he can grow out of this God nonsense.""

faustianredditor,offmychest,1389789241.0,"I feel the same way in some aspects. I wear a mask as well, feel the same way about my friends, and I'm often more uncomfortable in social situations than I should be. Here's what I'm trying:

Step 1: Find someone you can talk to. Someone who accepts you the way you are. Pour out your heart and soul to them as good as you can and put down that mask. Learn who you are. Find yourself, your goals, your issues. For me, that someone I talk to is ""from the internet"". That doesn't work quite as well as a person who is actually close to you, but it helps open up. I don't expect you to sit your best friend down and spill your guts to them. Not yet. That't not a good starting point. They can hurt you badly, so for the time being play it safe. Open up to your friends if you feel comfortable doing so.

(Try /r/r4r /r/kindvoice and maybe the answers to your post here, just to give you a starting point. Hell, if that doesn't work out, you can still try [rubber-duck debugging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) your personality. Just explain your actions and motivations to yourself. While another person might discover flaws in your thinking you don't see, explaining to yourself why you're doing what can uncover more of yourself than you maybe think.)

Step 2: Once you know who you are, who you want to be, and what's keeping you from doing it, start working on it.

For me, that means fixing the way I perceive myself. (by working on both myself and on the way I judge myself. Basically, get more comfortable with yourself by being better and by being less harsh with yourself)

Forcing myself out of my comfort zone.

Talking a lot to people. Particularly people I don't know. Even more so people I don't know how to talk to.

Also, it's usually good to be able to call a spade a spade. If you can find out what your problems are called, it's a lot easier to find support, information, material, motivation, people in the same boat, you name it. I used to live under the assumption that I was just shy as fuck. Saw the wikipedia article on social anxiety and I instantly could relate. I'm not a severe case by any means, but I get stress symptoms if you were to catch me off guard in a social situation.

That wikipedia article actually helped me pinpoint a rather unconscious thought process I seem to employ: ""[...]fear of what others are thinking about them (specifically fear of embarrassment, criticism, or rejection)[...]"" - This made me realize I'm not afraid of strangers or scared of people in general. It's a very specific part of the interaction that I fear like the devil. Well then, that's something I can work on.
* I don't need to avoid people to avoid my fear. I can protect myself against a fear of what others think of me.
* I can surround myself with people I don't really care about, just to prove to myself that people aren't as judgemental as I assume. This way, I can have rather risk-free social interaction.
* I can reduce the risk of being judged, or I can make myself not care about judgement, or I can make myself believe that other's don't really judge.
That wikipedia article made me realize how many options I have.


Step 3: Hopefully, profit. If not, I hope to at least see what else I need to do to get to where I want to be.

(to everyone:) Feel free to respond. Question my views. Talk to me. PM me. I'll be glad to be a rubber duck even, in hope it helps me as well. External views on my approach are appreciated, because after all I'm going by this as well, so it's in my interest to see flaws of it before they show up."

phaqueue,woweconomy,1389789627.0,"depends on your view of ""close"" I guess.

they announced another PVP season, meaning most people are projecting 5 months or so until WoD release... depending on your server and how much you actually want to spend leveling it, JC shouldn't take more than a week to level. (I've leveled professions 1-600 in a couple hours, but it all depends on mats availability)

Personally, I make easy gold off my enchanter and my scribe - they are actually my biggest money makers right now. Inscription is CHEAP to level (at least it was on my server) because you have more choices in what mats you use (each type of ink has 3-6 or so different herbs you can mill to get it, so you can choose the cheapest).

I'd recommend looking at inscription/JC or inscription/enchanting. If you go the enchanting route, might be worth it to just sell off the Ghost Iron and use that money to help level. 

With enchanting, you can find some really good deals using TSMs disenchant search - I make some easy gold that way.

I really thought inscription wouldn't be as profitable anymore since people don't have to keep rebuying glyphs (back when I used to make a TON off it was in Wrath, when they were still used up every time you changed them out). However, I do make plenty from inscription on my server and I don't even have all the patterns yet (still doing my daily research every day for all 3 types...)

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389790943.0,"&gt;How many guys dress and act and look like the depictions of men in video games?

That's not the point. Movies are a fantasy. Just like video games. You can look at what fantasies women have about themselves by looking at the kind of movies made for women and consumed by women. 

&gt; people like to see hot sexy sultry sexbomb women.

Except women apparently don't as much because the movies and tv shows they like don't have the heroines looking like that. Still [unrealistically beautiful](http://www.wallcore.net/2013/11/nina-dobrev-the-vampire-diaries-wallpaper-13987/), but in a different, more girly way. Because that's what their genuine tastes are like in what kind of women they like and like to look at and like to pretend they are in their place. 

Women love Sandra Bullock and Meg Ryan and Bridget Jones or that chick from Grey's Anatomy over Pamela Anderson or Megan Fox. Because they have slightly different beauty ideals in what they like and what they find impressive. As evidenced not by zhe feminism (most feminists hate Twilight for example) but buy the kind of things they buy and watch and fangirl over. 

There is nothing wrong with fantasies, but it's just incorrect to act like men and women have identical looking fantasies. Just look at what your average heroine looks and acts like in a RomCom or how your average teenage heartthrob guy differs from your typical male video gaming character. There's a reason why people rarely cast let's say Vin Diesel or The Rock or even Liam Neeson as the lead in a romantic comedy. They are the kind of guys that GUYS fawn over while the romantic comedy leads have to be the type that have to appeal to the female eye.

You aren't worrying that the only thing people see when you go in to work or go about on your daily business is your ass. Thus, being told your ass is attractive by strangers doesn't bother you. You know when you get to work that people won't be thinking of you as purely a sex object. Third, despite the imbalance in power, were you worried for your safety? No, right? Women generally aren't as violent as men. Fourth, were these women at all attractive to you? A lot of the time catcallers are ugly, older, or clearly creepy.

While that certainly applies to updates within the same system I guess it's down to the individual users preference as to how much it applies when switching system providers.

aDDnTN,motorcycles,1389791381.0,"&gt; The problem is those capabilities only hold value if you need it.

this is absolutely false. You may not be able to exploit it fully, but that doesn't mean the utility isn't there to exploit. And when you exploit something you are utilizing it's value. when you sell the car, the buyer is converting his money into that utility and value. For you maybe buying a car is a bad investment, but for many others it is a necessary one.

&gt; It's the same feeling I get looking around the beltway at traffic jams mainly consisting of one person per huge vehicle.

I am with you on this. Please stop trying to make my argument ""cars are great and everyone should have one. motorcycles are toys."" I am LOGICALLY and RATIONALLY discussing the VALUE of a car and it's utility against the VALUE of a bike and it's utility.

Besides, if you REALLY want to get efficient, RIDE A BICYCLE. It's the MOST EFFICIENT form of transportation humanity has ever invented.

And remember, just because it works for you doesn't mean everyone else can make it work like you. You might just be that 1:1,000,000 that just doesn't need a car as a primary vehicle.

Before you get to elevated, let me inform you that in my house, we have 1 car and 1 motorcycle for two people. My wife commutes 80 miles a day, and we often take weekend trips to East or West TN (family&amp;friends) which is about a 300 mile round trip.

I work 3 miles from home, and either ride the bus, get dropped off, or ride the Legend. Yes, 6 miles a day, it never adds up to anything! But i choose to take my sticky rubber and use it in the twisties, rather than driving TWO vehicles up to the smokies from nashville. So i don't ride 30k a year.

----------------

My Fuel Efficiency Calcs:

The average bike gets 5-10 mpg better than the average car (call it ~20% better mpg). The tires last 1/4 as long (and those are LONG LIFE TIRES), but you do only need 2. In 30k miles on a bike, you need to swap oil+filter 6 times, replace tires 3 times (on average), have the brakes bled and pads replaced, adjust the valves, and likely put a new chain and sprocket on there. Add to that any specific maintenance the manufacturer requires and don't forget that motorcycle shop hours are usually 150% of what car shop hours cost. In 30k miles in a car, you change the oil+filter 6 times, rotate the tires 3 times, swap the cabin air filter, and CHECK everything else. Add to that any specific maintenance the manufacturer requires.

30000 miles/30mpg (average car)= 1000 gallons

30000 miles/40mpg (average bike)=750 gallons

250 gallon difference x $4/gallon = $1000 difference in fuel

at $150/shop hour for the bike, that $1000 is eliminated in 6:45 of shop hours.

The utility of the bike over the car is marginal at best, and when you add in the extra utility of the car, it swings it in favor of the car. Most people take this path. You personally have extra utility in a bike (ease of parking and traffic) and extra cost in car ownership (more risk, expensive parking, tolls), so for you the calc swings back in favor of the bike. Do you not see how marginal the difference is for average people?

-----------------------------

In my case, i get utility from the bike, but my household gets A LOT more utility out of our car. So you are an extreme outlier for MC usage over car (statistical terminology) and i'm a little outside of the middle of the pack.

So please, don't get mad at me because i'm somewhat representative of MOST riders in terms of personal vehicular economics, while you are more-or-less a unique, isolated, and (imo) temporary occurrence.

Maybe life will catch up with you, and you'll be right back near the middle with everyone else. Try not to judge so harshly from your unique position, because someday your judgement will come right back around on you. That's life.

PS: your belief that you are the epitomy of a rider, even though you obviously aren't is a form of bias. I find knowing about bias is the only way to combat them. here is a link to help you get started on that. it is focus on money, but value is almost the same thing.

AkiraZXE,truegaming,1389791706.0,"That's exactly what I'm trying to say.

*I'm* not trying to make any game. Fundamentally, I'm saying that if there are that many people who take issue with the state of games *now*, they should come up with a concrete idea about *how they want games to be*.

Like this. They say they want games with strong female leads? That approach games from a woman's perspective? Then describe these things to me. Those statements don't mean anything on their own, but they're the most common statements whenever this topic gets brought up. It doesn't matter what kind of game it is, as long as it's a good game (nobody nitpick this one, you know what I'm trying to say) and it includes these concepts they say have been left out.

What's a ""strong female lead""? Is she literally physically capable? Intelligent? Determined? Caring? What kind of issues can she face that are related to femininity, as a feminine character? How can this be made into a game, whatever that game may be?

If they can answer these questions, and apply them to game design, then they should be able to come up with ideas for a ""non-problematic game"" or whatever it may be. Those concepts can then be compared to today's games.

This shouldn't even be that much to ask for, really. You don't tell somebody ""I don't like your thing, so you need to figure out exactly what's wrong with it and fix it"". You tell them what's wrong with it, in detail, and ideally give them solutions to consider if the answer isn't immediately obvious. Otherwise, you're going to get blown off, and rightfully so."

This point needs to be made: You don't necessarily have to be justified in fighting it, because the city is not necessarily justified in giving you the ticket (ie. the rules you apparently broke are not clearly laid out on any sign near where you parked, you would have to go online to research the rules before knowing you couldn't park there).

it is a WEED. anyone can grow it almost anywhere. if they legalize it and sell seeds, people will still grow it. The black market will persist, because people like avoiding vice tax. and it will be harder to crack down on them, because no one asks to see your tax stamp unless you are dealing.

short term, it's hard to invest, because this product is illegal to profit from federally and everyone uses federal dollars currently. Pretty much all banks have to abide by federal laws as well as state laws. For them right now, there is too much risk in taking legal weed money from distributors because the feds haven't changed anything, so it stands to reason that if they take it, the feds will come in and shut them down for illegal activity. TOO MUCH RISK.

With cannabis, the only way to make money is to grow it and sell it yourself. You can make a little bit of money selling someone else's product for them, but it's usually enough to have some yourself. What's left for the guy 5 proxies away in a different state? Just the stems and seeds, bro.

3) Here, the denominator cannot be 0. So 3x - 8 is not 0, 3x is not 8, or x is not 8/3. Your domain is R \\ {8/3}

5) Use parentheses around your exponents. Write ""-x\^(2) + 5"" to get ""-x^(2) + 5"". The average rate of change of f(x) between x = a and x = b is (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a). So in this case you want (-4^(2) + 5) - (-(-2^(2)) + 5)/(4 - -2)

17) h = -16t^(2) + 120t + 4. (Unless he was throwing from 4 feet *below* ground level.)

a) v = -32t + 120 (velocity = acceleration\*time + initial velocity). Velocity is 0 when the ball reaches its full height, so 0 = -32t + 120. Thus 32t = 120, or t = 15/4.

Reddit_SuckLeperCock,AnimalsBeingJerks,1389793602.0,"These may not be exact figures etc because of my lack of extensive research (other than what I see in the media etc) but the gist of it is this - Western Australia has a very long coastline full of sharks and there's been some heavily publicized shark attacks in the last decade. I think maybe 13 deaths in 10 years. After 2 deaths in November 2013 (plus several attacks leading to injury but no death), the current government has had a knee-jerk reaction to quell the 'panic' that the media's drummed up. Because of the hot climate and huge beautiful coastline this state has, there are 10's of millions of beach goers annually, it's a national pastime as 80 plus % of Aus's population lives on the coast and WA is no exception. So you can see that a couple of shark deaths is statistically insignificant, but it's a pretty boring place so the media jumps all over it.

Every summer there are daily helicopter patrols, and boats on the water looking for sharks near popular beaches around major cities. If one is seen, the beaches are closed until it's gone, sometimes it takes days for them to re-open. This year however the governments decided to issue licenses to kill any large sharks seen close by major city areas. Again this may not be exact measurements, but any shark over 3 metres long (usually Tigers, sometimes Great Whites) that are spotted within 1 kilometer (it may be 3 km but I can't remember...) off the coast are issued with a kill order, and then shark hunters on boats are allowed to pursue, bait, catch and kill them. There have also been a large number of 'drum lines' fixed and baited under water within 1 km of beaches, these are basically huge fishing reels with shark hooks, baited and left for the sharks to hook themselves and die/or be hauled in later.

It's contoversial, I'd say the majority of people (at least the ones who have some sense) realise that it's not really a problem because the chances of being bitten or killed are nearly zero, the (mainly) greens and left leaning populace have been having mass protests and there's been backlash against the current government. I tend to agree with the protesters as we're in the sharks habitat and they're natural predators, I say take caution and realise there's a very small risk but there's no need for the cull. Having said that it's actually surprising how many sharks are out there, recreational fisherman catch them every day (big Tigers, Bull Sharks etc) all up and down the coast line off beaches and jetties and they are seen all the time off boats close to shore. Sharks are scary as shit when seen up close in the ocean (had a very inquisitive 1.5 metre black tip reef shark circling me for 5 minutes last week when diving) but this cull is just not on.

Anyway sorry for the wall of text, I'm pretty drunk at the moment (I am Aussie after all!)."

But in this day an age? Honestly? I could place no fault on, and would not find it weird at all for someone to want to keep that out of the public eye. Not everyone can handle the kind of criticism and disdain you would receive on a daily basis, even if some of it is unintended. 

But I'm not sure that's what the OP was really trying to address.

Thornnuminous,offmychest,1389794324.0,"That's rough. It really is.

Can you focus on the good aspects of your life? 

It is possible to have a wonderful, thrilling life without children. In fact, breeding isn't the sum total of who you are or what you are capable of. Without kids, you have a lot more room to explore and live your life.

Dyslexia is a bitch, no question. My cousin has it as about as severely as you can do. He's also had Rheumatoid arthritis since he was 3, so his fingers can't spread, his wrists can't bend, he's in pain a lot.

Guess what he's doing? He's working a job he loves AND he did university. He just had to do it differently than people without his challenges. It took him longer. He had to find people who could help him discover how best HE can learn, rather than the one-size-doesn't-fit-all approach everyone else was forced to use.

So you don't know what you're going to end up doing? Guess what, most people don't. I'm not doing anything now even CLOSE to what I got my eventual degree in. No way in hell I could've seen that coming.

And why wouldn't you be depressed if you're stressing out this badly? 

*hug*

Talk to your academic advisor and tell him/her about your challenges. Talk to your doctor and advocate for yourself to get care.

You CAN have a great life if you look into how and why and what makes YOU happy and successful instead of looking at how other people are doing it, then beating yourself up for not being those people.

You can do this."

NoIdeaJustOneName,DebateAChristian,1389794529.0,"Let's start from the beginning : for us christians, all love is a God-ish thing. Love comes from God. That's the reason he created us : to have someone with who he could share love.

In this frame, loving people give each other sexual pleasure (the greatest expression of love) in order to share love together, and maybe create some other unique human being to be loved. 

From this point of view, sexual pleasure without the possibility to create this to-be-loved being, or the project to do it later, can be seen as selfish. So, people only fucking with contraception their whole life, or homosexual who don't want to adopt children, miss out on a big part of love : the joy to share it with your child.

Thanks to evolution, these kind of people will not transmit this flaw to their descendants :p

(As you can read: even if I am christian, I call bullshit the fact two homosexual cannot raise a child properly : first, there is plenty of counterexamples about it; second, I still have to read something which explains why two people of the same sex cannot share god's love, even if there's no example of it in the Bible.
I also consider it's ok to use contraception, as long as you can consider having children with your partner later).

You'll survive until college. Trust me. I didn't have my first boyfriend until after I went. Yeah, the companionship is nice, but you have to consider the cost. You'll hardly die alone if you don't have a boyfriend right now. 

As for finding someone else to talk to for hours and hours... Well, there are plenty of people on the internet. Some of them are even decent. I found most of my internet friends through gaming, and we all talk for hours and hours. Some of these friends have been friends forever, and have helped me through more shit than you would believe. 

I actually met my current S.O. online, and trust me, I'm not that attractive (pretty plain/kinda ugly without makeup)...

CrazyPlato,dresdenfiles,1389795845.0,"Remember that the story progresses from Harry's point of view. At first, Harry dealt with small-time stuff: wannabe sorcerers like Victor Sells, gang crimes, cheating spouses, etc. As the books continue, we see Harry's worldview expanding: he learns about werewolves, gets in contact with the far courts and vampire courts, and starts learning about the nations of the Accorda and their politics. The further into the series he goes, the more he learns that his world is bigger than him. To be honest, we'd all experience it the same way: being a wizard among mortals makes you feel like the big fish in a small pond, but you eventually learn that there are much bigger and nastier things out there than you.

That's why Storm Front is first: it's shows us how much Harry has to learn at first, so that we can appreciate how far he's come by Changes (by which point he's a well-known entity on a global scale and actively affecting Accords politics)"

pinkpixy,AskReddit,1389795928.0,"Doctors are too busy for Reddit but since my dad is MD/ER here's what I've learned from him:


1. Go to the doctor if your bowel movements are consistently green for a week or more. This could be a staph (thanks for the spell check!) infection or worse.


2. Pay attention to the shape of the moles on your skin. If they appear discolored or unsymmetrical, this is a bad sign. Moles like this have the potential for skin cancer.


3. If you're bleeding DARK red out of your anus something is wrong with your intestines and digestive tract(thanks again for spell check.)


4. If you're coughing for more than two weeks while huffing and pains from the chest. If you don't catch bronchitis early on, it can turn into pneumonia.


5. If your throat closes up for any reason you're having an allergic reaction to something that could be potentially lethal to you. Take a Benadryl or two and get to a hospital ASAP!


6. If your heart is beating at an irregularly fast speed like it's going to come out of your chest. (I don't mean because of something emotional.)


7. If you have repeat sun damage and a mole/sore appears and won't go away. Sometimes it can look as though it has a scab on top. This is cancer.


8. Intense dizziness and blindness all of a sudden. This could be many different things.


9. If your pee feels like needles when it comes out. That could be a UTI or an STI either way you need to see a doctor if it doesn't stop in a 24 hour period.


That's all I've got for now, off the top of my head.


Edit: i think mental health goes undiagnosed and untreated a lot too. Major sadness in conjunction to moodiness, focus issues, traumatic childhood, over sleeping, sleep deprivation, addiction, rape/molestation, hallucination, etc. These issues don't go away on their own and in some cases time doesn't heal them unless there's professional supervision."

The best part is that unlike when other neurotypes go psychopath we try to avoid being quite as flashy when going for power, we try to control situations and twist them (as on a subconscious level the empathy is still there so we still feel pain) to work out for the best for all involved, maybe a bit better for us. Some don't really learn the skills, some don't learn them early enough to make them automatic but with the way the world treats us we most commonly are psychopathic in addition to autistic, when coupled with some differences innate to autism (different emotional language mostly) we appear to practically be emotionless to NTs.

Then you have Sherlock. Depending on the interpretation he may be anything from autistic to sociopathic to psychopathic to simply an ass. In Sherlock I would say he's either an ass or a sociopath, though high functioning he would be rather low functioning for his neurotype (they blend far better and care about others quite a bit more). In Elementary I would say that he is almost certainly being portrayed as one of us and rather well in my opinion. In the recent movies, he's simply asinine. There's enough room left in the source for him to be interpreted in many ways, give a person enough rope and they'll hang themselves. You can't really fault an actor though, they're taught to read people and emulate them almost as well as we often learn to but they're never stripped of the notion that being unable to read another does not mean there's nothing there to read, something we figure out at young ages.

If you want your medical history to be available to anybody who wants the information, VS it being kept ""secret"" as it is right now. Imagine the pandora's box effect if medical history would be easily accessible like that..

Also, take a look at the number of guns sold between private individuals as compared to the number of guns sold via ""straw sales"" and you'd get a more clear view of why the gun-nuts are so against your idea of privacy destroying background checks.

The truth is that, with the hundreds of thousands of laws already in the book, when a person is caught in a straw-sale, 9 out of 10 times they plea a deal that sees them doing no time at all, maybe a month or two of community service.

I think the trick is to stop the revolving door policy at the court-house/jails when it comes to violent offenders and those who enable them.

Dr_Destructo28,TrollXChromosomes,1389797959.0,"I had a great number of experiences in college where I was hanging out with a guy for a while, only to discover he wasn't into me.  College social life tends to be a lot more ""hanging out in X's dorm and watching a movie"" rather than going out on official dates.  I had one guy friend in particular who I was really attracted to and who I was spending a lot of time with, and then he started dating someone else out of the blue (incidentally, she became one of my best friends, and I'm still good pals with the guy, who is currently overseas).  This is the 21st century.  Men and women will often just hang out casually, which can sometimes make it difficult for us to tell if it's a ""date"" or not.  I'd suggest making your move sooner (like the first couple of weeks of acquaintanceship) rather than later.  That way you can know if the person is actually romantically interested in you.  If you wait a year, you really can't call that her ""friend zoning"" you because you acted like a platonic friend that whole time.

Also, I will usually let a guy know that I like him early on by trying to cuddle with him or hold his hand during a movie, etc.  I actually was the one who lunged in for the first kiss with my current boyfriend.  If the girl hasn't made any sort of attempt at physical contact after a month of knowing her, you probably have your answer.

So to sum it up:
If you are interested in a relationship, tell her early on.  Don't blame girls for ""friend zoning"" you if never tell them ""hey, I dig you."""

engineered_broom,AskEngineers,1389798077.0,"A very common management technique is to give you exactly (or sometimes slightly less than) the amount of time to complete the task as their estimations have predicted while still secretly expecting you to sometimes go over (everyone seems to use different stats for it). It may look bad, but just know that they know their deadlines are tight and still appreciate your efforts. This is because if you give a person 5 days to complete a task, even if it actually only takes 4 days normally, the person will always take 5 days.  
  
The best method for dealing with this sort of thing is to keep a detailed work diary of everything you are doing and every problem you have encountered. If anyone tires to confront you about not meeting a deadline, it looks much better if you can show them what aspect of the task led to you exceeding the deadline.

**Leveling Dungeons**

They are basically race to the end. Most of the people will be in heirlooms and in really no danger of dying. Use this time to test out your abilities. Always wondered what that cooldown does? Try it! Have a cool idea that might work? Test it out... Generally let your group know beforehand, but honestly you have to try pretty hard to get yourself killed in leveling dungeons anymore (at least until like Wrath or Cata dungeons). Also use that time to focus on learning your hotkeys. When you get to endgame, you want those keys to be completely muscle memory, when you're tanking a boss in a raid and you need a cooldown, or you need some ability, you don't want to have to look down and search your actionbars to find it.

**Role of a tank with more than one:** 

This will only happen in 10m raids and above. You will have 2-3 tanks depending on the fight. Your job depends entirely on the fight here. For some fights, you will be ""swapping"" with the other tank. This generally happens when the boss puts some sort of really bad debuff on the tank, so you need to switch so the other tank doesn't die. You will just attack the boss like normal (all tank specs can now continuously attack, not like it used to be where you needed the boss to be hitting you in order to generate rage/mana (actually - not 100% sure about rage here - haven't played a rage class in MoP yet... can a warrior/druid sound off here?). Since you're a pally, you can just continually use your abilities. When the debuff is applied (or applied to a certain number of stacks, depending on the fight) you will taunt the boss, and it's your turn to tank - sometimes you will have to run in and switch places with the other tank, other times you can stand on top of each other (also depends on boss) for more, see my explanation of SoO bosses above it should give you some idea, or head to youtube and watch a video - any fight above where I say ""tank swap"" is a good one to watch for this mechanic.

Other times - one tank will tank the boss, the other will pick up ""adds""  or additional monsters that spawn during the fight. Some examples of this are Siegecrafter Blackfuse (actually, he has both mechanics in one fight) and Garrosh

Some fights are more unique, for instance on Spoils of Pandaria, the raid splits into 2 groups and they are separated from each other each trying to clear their ""side""

During trash, hope in and start spamming some AOE abilities, you will be basically just fighting for aggro while the stuff gets AOEd down. If the trash is 2 bigger mobs (like the ones right before Immerseus) you will generally each tank one of them. 

**""Main"" stats for Pally Tank**

As a pally tank, you will never bother with agility. If the gear has agility on it, it's not for you. (note this is endgame advice. While leveling there are items with str/agi on them - they are ok to use if they're better than what you have). While leveling, get str/stam for the most part - you really don't need to worry about anything else (if you have heirlooms, there's only a couple slots you have to worry about anyways). When you get to endgame, like I said earlier, if it has agility, it's not for you, don't even roll on it. Strength will be on all your gear, don't worry about how much or stacking it as a pally tank, you will get it by default just from the gear you pick up. You won't be gemming for it at all either. Basically just take what comes on the gear. 

**Glyphs**

I really like the consecration one for leveling in 5-mans, and I still use it for LFR... it allows you to toss a consecrate on the healer/ranged and stuff will generally come to you instead of getting to them. The holy wrath glyph isn't bad. Some other options are:

 * divine protection - makes your divine protection have a physical damage reduction, at the cost of 1/2 it's magic damage reduction. Not bad for leveling in dungeons

* alabaster shield - not sure what level you get shield of the righteous, but when you do, put on this glyph. More damage from shield is excellent, and you will be casting shield a LOT

* avenger's shield - not a bad choice for raids, not really ideal for dungeons (you want to hit multiple things in dungeons more often, in raid you will generally be only hitting one boss a lot)

there are others but I can't remember the rest off the top of my head (I'll try to remember to update when I get home and have better access to WoW)

Hope this helps!"

What ultimately helped me is going to visit a bunch of my friends and going out and flirting with other men. Most of my friends live 5+ hours away so I made the trip down to see them on a long weekend and I got super drunk having a good time with them and flirted with men. When they reciprocated and showed interest in me (even if it was superficial) it showed me that I *am* attractive, I *am* going to attract new men, and most importantly at that point in my life, I *am* desirable. It was then that I realized I would find someone new in time. And in the time between then and now I would focus on living my life the way I wanted, and loving myself for it.

spongemonster,AskScienceFiction,1389798644.0,"1) Because the lightsaber is as much a symbol of the Jedi as it is a weapon.  A sword with infinite edges, a weapon that can just as easily kill a careless user as kill someone else.  Pretty symbolic of the force and jedi if you ask me.

2) The lightsaber is much less ""lethal"" than a sword with regards to amputation.  A lightsaber cauterizes as it cuts, even major arteries have a much better chance of being sealed with a lightsaber strike.  A sword doesn't do this.

3) In a universe where energy weapons are so common, it's handy to have something that can be used to effectively counter ranged attacks.  Plain metal swords lack this advantage, short of some sort of magnetic sealing, but it's been done (ex. Gray Paladins)."

Dr_Destructo28,TwoXChromosomes,1389798655.0,"I'll add my own embarrassing/funny sex toy story here.

My parents moved to a different state while I was in college.  I had not yet packed up my bedroom at their house, and one day I got a call from my dad saying ""hey! We all tackled your room this week, so don't worry about it.""  By ""we all"" he meant him, my mom, my sister, and my brother in law.  I turned white and tried to casually ask ""did you pack up my closet also?""  My dad said ""yup, we got it all, there was a lot of junk in there.""  His tone was much too casual for him to have been the one to find IT.  *It* being a rather large purple dildo that I had stashed on the upper shelf of my closet.  I knew that he couldn't have found it, or he's sound much more awkward at the mention of my closet.  So either my mom found it and kept it to herself (which was only slightly better than my dad finding it) or my sister or brother and law found it, which would have been the best case scenario.  I immediately called my sister, she answered and I immediately said, ""PLEASE TELL ME THAT YOU OR JESSE PACKED UP MY CLOSET!""  She laughed and said, ""Don't worry!  I found it and zipped it in an old fanny pack in your closet and put it in a box.""  Sisters watching out for each other, FTW!"

Basilgate,WritingPrompts,1389798697.0,"My turn to get the next round. I said everyone’s order out loud, to help me remember, and eased out from behind the table. Jennifer gave my ass a little squeeze when I stepped around her, and I decided it was rather cool of me to not react. Besides, I had something fun planned for when we got home.

“Just a coke for me,” Frank said, as I passed him, slapping my shoulder in a way that made me want to punch him.

“Yeah, got it.”

He laughed stupidly and slumped down next to Sandra. 

The bar was pretty empty; just one guy on a stool, slouched over the counter. As I approached he turned deliberately and stared right into my face with hooded eyes. The rich, sour smell of booze from him hit me like a wet rag. The drink in the little glass beneath him looked, and smelled, like battery acid. Shit, I thought. The bartender was nowhere in sight, and I didn’t want to be stuck talking to this guy. I glanced over quickly, and he was still staring, and in fact had shuffled a little closer to me, and was looking at me like my face held the answer to something he was trying very hard to remember. I searched around some more for the bartender.

“Excuse me,” I called, in my most commanding voice.

Nothing.

“Marcus!” The drunk next to me yelled, causing me to flinch. “That... that’s yourshbb. Your *name.* Marcussss.”

“Uhh... what? How do you... uhh?”

I was feeling very uncomfortable now, assuming that he’d been probably listening in on my friends and I. I looked over to them, possibly for help, but they were all deep in conversation, laughing about something.

“Hey,” he said, leaning towards me as if we were discussing some great conspiracy, “I’m an angel.”

“Ha... wow.”

“I know, right. Crazy.”

“Yeah.”

“*Ohhh* yeah.”

“Yup. Umm...”

“Crazy.”

“Yeah, listen, I’m just gonna...”

“Wait,” he said, waggling an accusing finger in my face. He studied me for a moment. “You don’t believe me.”

I looked at him. To be honest, he was probably quite a handsome guy when not utterly shit-faced. But hardly angelic. As if hearing my thoughts he sat himself upright, and wiped his matted blonde curls away from his oily face. Trying very hard to focus his bloodshot eyes. It didn’t make much difference.

“No, I do, I do,” I said, humouring him. “I mean, it’s just not every day you see an angel. At a bar. Uhh.. y’know...”

“What? Drunk?”

“Well...”

“So what? Huh? Where doess-uh it say in the Bible that I can’t drink?”

“I think it probably...”

“It *doesn’t*,” he said, slamming his fist on the counter, for emphasis

He stopped then, frowning as if he wasn’t really sure.

“Well, the good thing for you is, I guess, the Bible is more of a rulebook for us, for humans, and so the rules probably don’t apply to angels.”

His face lit up.

“Yeah. *Yeah*. That’s, y’know, that’s probably true.”

Still no bartender.

“So, uhh... where’re your wings?”

He looked at me as though I’d just asked a profoundly stupid question. He took a swig of his battery acid drink, coughed noisily, and then turned his whole body to me. I retracted a little.

“I know you still don’t believe me. You’re humouring me.”

“No, look.”

“Jennifer’s cheating on you with Frank. You know that time she said she had to go to her Mum’s house to help her out cos she was (burp) sick. Yeah, she actually went to Frank’s house he rode her like... I dunno, like it was the Grand National, or something.”

“...What?”

He suddenly looked very worried.

“Oh shit... uhhh... No, nothing, sorry.”

“No...wait. What? What the fuck did you just say?”

“Nothing, it’s nothing,” he grumbled, laughing nervously and turning away from me.

I stood frozen, staring at him. Not sure whether I was more furious or confused. The drunk looked up, as if expecting to see something frightening above him, and then buried his head as far down as it would go, muttering “*Shit, shit, shit, ohh shit*” to himself. I looked over to the table my friends were at, watching as Frank leaned towards Jennifer and whispered something into her ear. She laughed.

“Hey, can I help you?”

I jumped at the bartender’s voice. I’d completely forgotten the order, and absently said whatever came to mind. As the drinks were being portioned out I grabbed the guy by his grimy jacket and turned him back to me.

“How do you know that?” I said.

For a moment, there was a swell of light, and I saw the drunk transformed as if by a cleansing wind. His golden hair shone and flew away from his glowing face, while a pair of lustrous wings unfurled from behind him with majestic languor. I took a frightened step back and the image faded.

“It’s nothing, I’m sorry,” he said, a guilty grin flashing across his filthy face. “Just forget it.”

I couldn’t speak. I opened my mouth but no sound came out. The drunkard turned back to his drink and I stumbled away from him, feeling heavy and dizzy. There was a ringing in my ears. I sat down at the table with my friends, noticing my vision starting to blur.

“Hey where’re the drinks?” someone said.

Absently, I realised I needed to use the bathroom.

“Oh shit, Marc, are you alright?”

I saw Jennifer, looking at me, full of concern, and I felt myself falling from the chair as the world turned to black."

it's all about the length of the arm. Longer stroke (the arm), with more displacement (the load, in this analogy), means torque on tap from the get go.

With 4 little arms and 4 little loads, you get less torque down low, but more power on the top (more efficient design).

Better example than a vtwin, is the single cylinder, aka Thumpers. KLR650 vs GSXR-750.

i_am_a_freethinker,mormon,1389799472.0,"Okay, great. Let's look at what COLDS teaches about a Prophet of God.

From [Gospel Principles](https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-9-prophets-of-god?lang=eng):

&gt;A prophet is a man called by God **to be His representative on earth. When a prophet speaks for God, it is as if God were speaking** (see D&amp;C 1:38). A prophet is also a **special witness for Christ, testifying of His divinity** and teaching His gospel. A prophet teaches truth and **interprets the word of God.** He calls the unrighteous to repentance. **He receives revelations and directions from the Lord** for our benefit. He may **see into the future and foretell coming events so that the world may be warned.**

&gt;We should do those things the prophets tell us to do. President Wilford Woodruff said that a prophet will never be allowed to lead the Church astray:

&gt;&gt;“The Lord will never permit me or any other man who stands as President of this Church to lead you astray. It is not in the programme. It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that, the Lord would remove me out of my place” (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Wilford Woodruff [2004], 199).”

&gt;How can we sustain the prophet? We should pray for him. **His burdens are heavy, and he needs to be strengthened by the prayers of the Saints.**

&gt;**We should study his words.** We can listen to his conference addresses. We can also subscribe to the Ensign or Liahona so we can read his conference addresses and other messages he gives.

&gt;**We should follow his inspired teachings completely.** We should not choose to follow part of his inspired counsel and discard that which is unpleasant or difficult. The Lord commanded us to follow the inspired teachings of His prophet.

&gt;We are blessed in this insecure world to have a prophet through whom the Lord reveals His will.

From Uchtdorf:

&gt;[God] has not abandoned us today but continues to reveal His will to us through His prophets.

So, this is good. This is what you'd expect from a Prophet of God. He would talk with God, interpret the Word of God, and warn Humanity of coming calamities. He would speak directly to the people of the Earth. The Prophet of God should recieve revelation and direction from God and tell the Earth.

Let's look at [some of the most choice pickings of Monson](http://www.lds.org/prophets-and-apostles):

&gt;Through tears and trials, through fears and sorrows, through the heartache and loneliness of losing loved ones, there is assurance that life is everlasting. Our Lord and Savior is the living witness that such is so.

&gt;We know this mortal life is a test. But because our Heavenly Father loves us with a perfect love, He shows us where to find the answers. He has given us the map that allows us to navigate the uncertain terrain and unexpected trials that each of us encounters. The words of the prophets are part of this map.

&gt;Trust in God. Hold on in His love. Know that one day the dawn will break brightly and all shadows of mortality will flee. Though we may feel we are 'like a broken vessel,' as the Psalmist says, we must remember, that vessel is in the hands of the divine potter.

&gt;God’s love is there for you whether or not you feel you deserve love. It is simply always there.

&gt;Many more people could ride out the storm-tossed waves in their economic lives if they had their year's supply of food and clothing and were debt-free.

&gt;Self-reliance is a product of our work and undergirds all other welfare practices. It is an essential element in our spiritual as well as our temporal well-being.

&gt;Fill your life with service to others. As you lose your life in the service of Father in Heaven’s children, Satan’s temptations lose power in your life.

&gt;Because of Jesus Christ the world has changed, the divine Atonement has been made, the price of sin has been paid, and the fearful spectacle of death yields to the light of truth and the assurance of resurrection. Though the years roll by, His birth, His ministry, His legacy continue to guide the destiny of all who follow Him as He so invitingly urged.

**THIS IS BULLSHIT. THIS IS DRIVEL.**

Seriously. These words don't mean anything! Jesus motherfucking Christ! These are really terrible ""inspired"" words. Pintrest has better shit than Monson. His words are utterly devoid of substance.

Then, whenever you have something *actually worth talking about*, like monsoons or floods or banking catastrophes or Natural Rights of Man being trampled on, some bullshit PR talking head comes out of the Mormon ""Newsroom"" to talk about how The Church feels!

Or worse, you have the Prophet of God telling us that we only need one earring. Or that we have to cover our shoulder. Or that private masturbation a few times a week is a **sin next to fucking murder.** Nevermind the literally millions of starving people in the world, or the huge swaths of folks who don't have access to good education or drinking water, or the thousands each year that die from easily preventable diseases.

And what about the fuckups we've already gone through? Where was the huge push against slavery? Where was the warning about the Great Depression, or the shit-show of WWI, WWII, Vietnam, and the Cold War? Where was the warnings against the depletion of the ozone layer, or warnings about AIDS, or warnings about **fucking nuclear bombs**. You know, things that *actually* threaten humanity. Not motherfucking pornography or ""too much time playing video games.""

Jesus Christ. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills! This! *This* is why I don't have faith that God leads His ""prophets."" It's like the Emperor with No Fucking Clothes.

The question is *not* ""Why do [I] even care.""

The question is **why don't you.**"

The best part is that people like her, as soon as they've met her she can do no wrong. I can tell them about the time that I almost killed myself and they'll just forget about it because the only interpretation makes her the villain, I am shocked that they don't remember that she technically saved my life but I guess that would force them to wonder why which would lead back to it being her fault.

While it's true that nutrients can be administered intravenously, it's absurd to equate blood transfusions with ""eating"" since the body isn't using the blood as a nutrient, but rather as an organ in this context. But this is a long-standing belief of theirs, and even if the Governing Body of the organization secretly realized their error, they'll never go back on it now. Not when people have died for refusing transfusions, opening the organization up to lawsuits if they ever make a doctrinal change on this point.

And yes, it's also unbiblical because Jesus made it quite clear that the commandments of Mosaic Law (from which the prohibition against eating blood came) could be broken if lives were on the line. If even *animal lives* were on the line.

However, it's wildly inappropriate for them to try to exercise this cockamamie belief on behalf of someone who is not and never has been a Witness.

If I view the US government as particularly unstable and likely to have some sort of economic collapse, I might put my money in the Euro or Australian dollar instead.  If a lot of people do this with a lot of different currencies you see a net drop in value of the dollar vs other countries currencies.  In the long run that means higher prices of goods and raw materials from other countries, and therefore a higher price of goods.

This can also have the opposite effect.  If our country is viewed as more stable than others and the dollar goes up in value vs other currencies you can have a situation where inflation is offset and the prices of goods don't go up that much.    "

1) Anal tends to be the last place explored. Dicks aren't designed to go in there, but I'm going to make it happen anyway because I'm a winner.

2)  Dominance: I'm telling her what I want, and I'm going to get it. Who cares what it feels like. If you're into that sort of thing, it'll get you off.

3) Part two of dominance is that generally, by the time she's willing to let you ""do it all"" to her, she's pretty much handing over control of very delicate aspects of her body. Delicate not only physiologically, but also in that the rectum is a very intimate area that most people want to keep in check at all costs. If you've ever had something big up there (yes, I've tried it) then you know what I'm talking about. It's an odd mix of comfort with pleasure (at least at first) and weird stuff can happen that you wouldn't expect. The fact that she's willing to let me take over control in that scenario so that I can feel something completely different that what she's feeling is all sorts of awesome. 

4) It's ""sinful"".

5) The concept of DP, only I can make it happen myself! I know lots of chicks love it and I like showing them that I know by 3/4 fulfilling the fantasy.

Similarly, if dead is not dead, then all the consequences of a fake death are wasting our time and it means we don't take it seriously when someone dies.

This is also why the original Star Trek Wrath of Kahn worked on me: (forgive me, I'm *that* old!) I believed Spock was dead. And Star Trek Into Darkness failed: I didn't believe for one second Kirk was dead. (or Spock, if they'd gone that route)

Death has to mean something in order to have the emotional impact the writer intends.

If a writer gets known for hitting the big red reset button all the time, for faking too many things, for leading us down 1.5 hour blind alleys of faked or unwarranted emotions…then eventually I cease giving them my emotional attention. I might keep watching for curiosity, but I won't make an emotional investment.

Seeing that clearly Moffat is fond of hitting that button now puts the fear into me that maybe we were supposed to believe Lazarus. That that cockamamie complex explanation was supposed to be true, while all the other cockamamie complex explanations were supposed to be laughable…

Everyone likes it differently, completely differently. You've got to slowly work your way up. Start gently and slowly apply more pressure until, via the ancient art of COMMUNICATING, you reach the sweet-spot and stay around there.

Some guys will like submissiveness, some guys want you to take complete command. If you start in a less... overbearing/intimidating way, you will give them (and you) an opportunity to sense if you need to start getting more... MORE... I guess??

Same principal; don't look for a knot in their shoulder blade and immediately stick your knob...bly elbow into it. Gently apply pressure and find out if they need more.

You must think people are stupid. So, using male pronouns when referring to ""a man or a woman"" is a sexist abomination, but connoting ""good"" and ""bad"" with ""women"" and ""men"", respectively, *within your own anti-sexism movement*, is just dandy?

draconic86,videos,1389801512.0,"I agree, there are mountains of atrocities in the Bible, it even condones slavery, selling your daughter, forcing rape victims to marry their rapists, and more. It's a travesty. Not to mention that Christianity itself is an amoral system, providing people a loophole through with they can sin freely and live guilt-free, so long as they say ""sorry"" to Jesus every once in a while. I'm glad we can at least agree on something, you and I. However...

The ""That's in the Old Testament"" argument is impotent, because Jesus even said it outright:  “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."" Matthew 5:17

Now it seems you were also having some trouble following the reasoning I was laying out for you to follow in order to understand why I think that many Christians are in agreement with the WBC, so I laid out the path clearly. Read through it and you'll see why I am justified in saying what I did:

Fundamentalist Christians believe the Bible is the inspired word of God, and is to be read literally. The Bible, when read literally, explicitly tells people to kill gay men, to stone them to death, This would imply that ""God hates fags"". Therefore Fundamentalists believe that ""God hates fags"". The WBC Also believe that ""God hates fags"" or at least wants them to kill gay people, therefore Fundamentalists agree with what the WBC espouse and shout the loudest. There are a lot of Fundamentalist Christians, who are a subset of conservative Christians, therefore:

""Sadly the WBC are only shouting out loud what a lot of conservative Christians think to themselves in quiet,"" is a perfectly valid thing to say. It's not an assumption, it's not a ""generalizing"" because the statement equates to ""The Christians who agree with the WBC tend to agree with the WBC.""

I hope that helps.

Also, I find that some brands just *fit me better* than other brands. It's an investment to find which ones fit the best, in my opinion. Kudos to those who find that a cheaper brand that fits best.

ManicLord,AskMen,1389802597.0,"So, about half a year ago I got this text over Whatsapp from an unknown number from my country.  When I asked who it was, she (duh) started going off on how I did not care about her at all.  How I had used her and had not given a fuck about her feelings. 

I had not been to my country in two years.  I'd left without saying ""bye"" to some friends because I didn't really care.  They knew I was leaving, and I had already told them I'd miss them and shit. 

Apparently she had a crush on me since forever and had been upset for those two years for me not saying good bye.  To me, she was a friend and that was it.  But she needed some closure, I guess. 

Since she was being all ""you're an ass,"" I just gave up all manner of gentleness and told her, bluntly, that I'd never thought of her that way (now I knew who she was. She told me after I insisted I had no fucking idea who she was) and that I had no idea she ever felt that way. 

I even explained that I could not understand why she'd wait until I had been out of the country for two years to tell me, hold me accountable for her idiocy, and expect an explanation to something I had never given thought to. 


It was on a Friday night and I was already on a party. That also made me a bit more of an asshole.

Spartan IIs are also the same height and weight on average as SIVs on account of the SIVs being post-pubescent augments (unlike the SIIIs who were prepubescent augments in keeping with their rapid development)

SIVs also make up for their lack of genetic predisposition with custom vat grown organs and upgrades on the existing ones to put them at or better than physically the SII's inherent genetic superiority.  SIVs as a result have actually undergone *better* augmentations than SIIs (they have essentially a new pancreas, a new heart, and a wealth of other upgrades that make them more like space marines than spartans)

Plus the SIVs are better equipped than the SIIs or IIIs ever were, making up for their lack of experience with vastly superior equipment (compare the damage a helmetless Thorne took to the damage that a recently-helmeted Kat took for an excellent example of just how rapidly the technology has advanced)"

It is clear from what you've discovered that moving in together is a bad plan.  You're not ready, you rushed it because of the baby and now you've got to see that it's not a good plan.

As much as he tells me how pretty / sexy / appealing he finds me, knowing that if I don't make the first move, or set up circumstances that remind him to make a move, nothing is going to happen... He will never forget to come home and check Twitter, or peruse a messageboard, or whatever. He would certainly never fail to do those things for three weeks in a row. But he will absolutely fail to have sex with me.

This was my life in my DB. He was so affectionate and cuddly, but never, ever thought of sex first, or sought me out, or pursued me. I laughed bitterly at the mouse/lever analogy! Press button, receive erection. Like a monologue, not a dialogue; like taking a dildo out of a drawer.

Even though it isn't nearly as bad as some of the cold-hearted rejection described by both women and men in this subreddit, it did a number on me, absolutely. Freaking eroded my soul, honestly, feeling invisible and bodiless. Not to mention the fact that I would go into all these encounters already so defeated by his lack of native interest that feeling sexy was a challenge at best.

Sex to me is more than orgasms, it's soul-communication and deep intimacy AND orgasms, goddamn it. Being isolated from that communication was like being in a sensory deprivation tank.

&gt;Like I said before, this is not an issue over which I'd end an otherwise happy and perfect relationship, but it does eat at me. If I think about it too long I start to get really upset, and I don't need to burst into tears on the train home at night.

The DB refrain: ""this is such a great car, except for the fact it doesn't have brakes.""

If you can write these two sentences next to one another and not see how heartbreaking they are, I don't know what to say. All I can tell you is what I tell everyone in this sub -- *it is so much better on the other side*. Getting tumbled randomly! Being ""punished"" for wearing a certain pair of boots, or felt up to see what underwear I have on. The give-and-take of mutual arousal and flirtation instead of the perpetual solo act.

My husband and I are late in pregnancy on our third child and even now we're having more sex than I did in my DB relationship.

You will literally go NOWHERE on your first couple of walks with this method.  You're going to look like a fool to your neighbors just going back and forth a step or two steps.  

The alternative option would be to consider a halti leash.  They are the things that look like muzzle/nose harnesses.  They are not a muzzle at all but they give you complete control over the dog...since rushing forward would result in his head turning so they're unable to do so.  Getting them used to wearing one should take a couple of days but after that they are extremely easy to control.  This method does not train the dog, unfortunately, because as soon as you switch back to a regular leash, you'll see pulling again.

Right now you're rewarding your dogs pulling by letting them pull you along.  If you let them pull you forward an inch...they're going to take a mile.

benk4,explainlikeimfive,1389803383.0,"It would never be everyone vs everyone.  It would be groups vs groups.  There's simply not enough land and resources, plus the number of people willing to do it would be pretty small.  

&gt; If enough people do this it would tear countries apart.

If a large number of people hate their country enough to secede, wouldn't that be a good sign it wasn't a good country to begin with?  Take Yugoslavia for example.  It's better off split up.  

&gt; No country has the administrative force to suddenly deal with thousands of new countries all at once.

So I should be forced to stay a member of a country simply because other countries wouldn't have enough administration?  That's a pretty ridiculous reason.  

&gt; And in the end I think the solution would be to reclaim these ""countries"" by force from the current large countries and you would be no further.

Again, because there's a risk of me being reconquered I shouldn't be allowed to leave in the first place?  That's the same thing as ""don't play the game because you might lose.""  In fact it's more like ""because there's a risk of losing, I'm not allowing you to play.""

&gt; There can never be a good outcome of this in practice because humans are and will probably always be assholes.

I think you're greatly exaggerating the effects here.  The vast, overwhelming majority of people wouldn't leave the country to form their own micronation, mostly because they aren't stupid enough to.  And if they did, that's their problem, not yours.  If they go and get conquered, that's their problem not yours.  

The more likely scenario is you'd probably have a handful of these guys.  Maybe some towns or cities seceding.  Or maybe counties to make their own small nations.  If they really think they're better off without the US who are we to tell them they can't leave?  I don't think Key West actually forming a Conch Republic would cause the downfall of humanity and bloodbath that you're predicting.

RichAfterTaxes,gamecollecting,1389803439.0,"Man, just look at that packaging. It's amazing how much better Nintendo of Europe handled the Micro, relative to NOA. 

NOE had some great system colors for it, and the packaging itself is exceptional and makes it look like a big deal. Here in America, we instead got [this abomination.](http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/13/game-boy-micro-us-packaging) Not only does the packaging itself look like something designed specifically for the bargain bin (which is where the Micro quickly ended up), the prominently-displayed faceplates were cursed with tacky designs, and the default plates were seemingly engineered to be as bland as humanly possible. Danny Brown said it best: they were like fried chicken without seasoning. 

Nothing - literally nothing - about this seemed to justify its price tag, which was $20 above the GBA SP. Especially since Nintendo had just sweetened the pot for potential SP buyers by improving their screens. Nintendo did eventually release the sleek Famicom Micro here, but it was too little too late at that point, and the idea of releasing a Famicom-designed system in America was another foolhardy decision from a business standpoint. 

Many stores quickly slashed this thing down to $30-40 just so they could be done with it. It was a fascinating trainwreck to watch, and the Micro's recent re-evaluation and value increase are the cherry on top. I regret not stocking up back when they were worthless, frankly. If I had just picked up a few of those Famicom Micros and left them sealed, I never would have had to worry about textbooks again. You live and learn, though! "

Well, he's not a philosopher in the real world. Mass Effect is fiction. And I would rather enjoy fiction with multiple characters championing different points of view than every single one preaching the same thing, obviously. That makes for boring fiction.

Part of what makes Javik interesting as a character is that he comes from an exterminated race. His entire life was spent fighting genocide in an unwinnable war. His outlook is brutal and violent because of it, and he spends most of the game tiptoeing line between hero and villain.

The fact that I disagree with his views helps to make Mass Effect 3 more interesting. The Mass Effect series has always had good characterization (for a video game). Characters like Javik are what makes it strong."

myhomeaccountisporn,beer,1389803550.0,"I am currently the manager of a shipping store, and I ship beer all of the time.  I have a few tips for you.
 
 The first is to use FedEx International Economy.  DO NOT use the post office for something like this.  The Post Office doesn't like liquids.  

Secondly, I would package the beer very well (bubble wrap each bottle, and make sure there is something in between them so that you can't hear glass clinking, and float everything in packaging peanuts).  When you pick the box up and shake it, nothing should move inside the box. Make sure to wrap the bottles in a leak proof plastic bag.  This way, if a bottle is opened in transit, no leakage occurs and no one will open the package to see what is inside.

Thirdly, put a respectable customs value on the package.  One thing that makes it likely for a package to get flagged in customs (which you really don't want) is for a value to be suspicious.  As MissNitch said, you can label the package to be ""yeast samples"", and maybe put the value at a total of $25-$30 dollars.  This should avoid any customs issues.

If you're really stuck in your area and don't have a local shipping store to help you out, PM me and maybe I can help you out.  I get great discounts with international shipping and I could most likely beat the FedEx list rate for you.

phaqueue,wow,1389803566.0,"Unfortunately it's not common knowledge, but yes - if they get aggro they should be running towards you. I would say if you're pulling multiple packs, drop consecrate first, and then bring all the mobs to the consecrate. The AS will only hit 3 mobs at most, so you want to position yourself such that your Holy Wrath and Hammer of the Righteous will hit as much as possible, those are your ways to pull big groups of mobs. Also make sure you have the seal that AOEs on (righteousness I believe?) You don't really need the healing one at lower level unless your healer is afk or really bad (in which case you shouldn't be pulling that much anyways) between holy wrath and consecrate, things should stick to you rather well (or enough for them to die before they do much if any damage to someone else)

Get an idea of what you can reasonably handle with little/no heals (this includes using your CDs and even LOH) and pull that once or twice. If the healer still has more than 50% mana after these pulls, you're likely free to go nuts and pull as much as you want. If the healer can't seem to keep up, slow down a little. (You are REALLY tough to kill as a pally so don't be too afraid though)

thesilvertongue,Parenting,1389803865.0,"Sorry but if kids are having sex with each other you need to do a better job of supervising. 

Edit: Since I've pissed off a lot of people in this thread and been accused of trolling I thought I'd try explain myself better. 

*I am sorry that I made myself unclear. I assume that most of the downvotes and outrage come from people who don't understand what I am saying.* 

*The thread as a whole addresses sexual behavior in young children in general. Humans are sexual and flirtation, kissing, touching, and experimenting are normal and healthy in children.* 

*It was all fine and dandy until, /u/r04r04r (who is a nanny like myself) mentioned that children under his/her supervision had oral sexual intercourse with each other along with innocent playful nudity/touching.* 

*As a fellow nanny, I was horrified that children were engaging in (incestuous if you care about that kind of thing) sexual intercourse. I rather curtly suggested that his/her supervision was inadequate as the sexual intercourse that was taking place is very damaging to children.* 

*After several people dismissed the event as harmless fun childhood behavior I felt it necessary to remind people that childhood sexual intercourse is harmful and inappropriate. It is by standard definition, rape, because children cannot give consent.* 

*Many people are (or at least seem to be) suggesting that sexual intercourse between children is normal. I don't care how frequently it happens. It is very dangerous for (young) children to have sex and we should prevent to the best of our capacity.* 

*I always thought it was common knowledge that* ***sex ought to be between consenting adults.*** *Quite frankly, I'm a surprised and concerned that so many people are offended by what I am saying.*

*I hope that clears up any confusion. If you still have a problem, ask away.*

Edit #2 Dear everyone in this thread, on this subreddit, and stalking my comment history. As you can see, I had the audacity to suggest that a nanny was not adequately caring for her children after her charges engaged in sexual intercourse. Nannies and parents alike have a responsibility to prevent this kind of dangerous behavior and keep their children safe. I realize that we can't prevent anything but that doesn't change the fact that we, as responsible adults in charge of children, are 100% responsible for their safety and well being. It's our duty to keep them safe and when they are severely hurt, we have no one else to blame ourselves.

I am myself a nanny and I can't tell you how much remorse and guilt I would feel after failing to protect children from incestuous intercourse which will no doubt trouble them for years to come. The dismissive way the nanny referred to this incident was very concerning.

Sure enough, I was told she was ""in no way responsible for the children abusing their privileges of privacy"". This offended me greatly as nannies are always always always responsible for their children. I don't think protecting your children and, more importantly, acknowledging when you fail to do so is too much to ask.

Furthermore, my claim that rape is defined as non-consensual sexual intercourse was dismissed without cause. I was also told oral sex is normal, healthy, ""sex play"" for young children. Others admitted it was ""abnormal"" but didn't think of it as a legitimate threat to a child's well being. I'm really disappointed with this community's failure to  acknowledge the importance of consent.

My last complaint is about this community's general lack of tact and retiquette. This exchange has really frustrated me and I am aware I can come across as preachy or condescending. However, the absurd amount of hate I am receiving is inexcusable.

I have given an honest reply to every single person who has responded to me in the 23 children below. I have explained my reasons, and addressed all the issues and accusations I could. I've explained why I think my convictions are legitimate.

ulvok_coven,AskHistorians,1389803979.0,"Because that's a complicated enough issue to have an entire university course for it. Which there are. Indian policy is related to the personal and political goals of dozens of figures over hundreds of years - and that's just the whites. In a highschool course it would become a ""who can memorize tribal leaders and locations the best"" and the message would come across as ""the government hated Indians."" Neither of which are remotely representative of the issue, nor adequately explain what happened and why.

Perhaps with something like the Nazi regime, which can be boiled down to a certain set of principles in a relatively short time period, then you can more easily impress students with the depth of human cruelty. The 'genocides' of Indians were not always acts of cruelty - often they were acts of negligence, hells of good intentions, dehumanized actions for profit, plays between European powers, or the result of the belief in white culture's superiority. The notion of 'whiteness,' even, arises *during* the Indian period and is affected by Indian policy. I think Nazi Germany is already somewhat Flanderized in education and gives students a bad understanding of very important events. There is no possibly way to teach this issue without reducing it to stereotype and hand-waving."

If feminism doesn't solely blame men, that means it blames some women too, right? Presumably, women who support the Patriarchy/Kyriarchy. Let's look at those women. 

How are women who support the oppressive gender system explained, within feminism? 

By Internalized misogyny/internalized sexism (meaning the same thing).

http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/10/20/internalized-sexism/

So this is essentially the insanity defense for all women who are complicit in the oppressive system, thereby abrogating them of any responsibility. 

&gt;The consequence of internalizing this role is an enormous reservoir of self-hate. This is not to say the self-hate is recognized or accepted as such; indeed most women would deny it. It may be experienced as discomfort with her role, as feeling empty, as numbness, as restlessness, as a paralyzing anxiety at the center. Alternatively, it may be expressed in shrill defensiveness of the glory and destiny of her role. But it does exist, often beneath the edge of her consciousness, poisoning her existence, keeping her alienated from herself, her own needs, and rendering her a stranger to other women. They try to escape by identifying with the oppressor, living through him, gaining status and identity from his ego, his power, his accomplishments. And by not identifying with other “empty vessels” like themselves. Women resist relating on all levels to other women who will reflect their own oppression, their own secondary status, their own self-hate. For to confront another woman is finally to confront one’s self-the self we have gone to such lengths to avoid.


Feminists cannot comprehend why any woman would be confortable in her gender role, so they declare them all insane and alienated acting against their needs.

Also notice the ""identifying with her oppressor"" bit, which is pretty telling how one-sided they see this whole oppression deal. 

Why is it called internalized? Can men be internalized sexists too? 

I'm afraid not, young padawan. You see, men externalize sexism. They are the source.  Women can at worst be brainswashed parrots for men's evil, sexist beliefs."

benk4,explainlikeimfive,1389804760.0,"&gt; You seem to have the impression people will secede in unified groups of, perhaps, the size of an established city. When in reality it would likely be just generally chaotic.

You seem to have the impression that everyone is going to secede into small plots of land.  That's pretty ridiculous.  Not many people would try to cut themselves off from the country.  But if they did that's their problem.

&gt; All people would do is abuse this ""total ownership"" of different areas to gain from others around them. For example, setting up road tolls in formerly busy areas etc.

So if I built a road through my land isn't it within my rights to charge a toll?

&gt; Unless you plan on being totally self sustained on your plot of land, you kind of depend on other people to survive.

Exactly.  Which is why very few people would do it.  

&gt; I think in reality what you'd like is for your country to allow just you to secede and be left alone from that point on.

No thanks,  I'd rather not secede.  It's fairly ridiculous to think I'd be better off on my own.  But I'm not going to tell you that you have to stay if you don't want to just because I think I'm better off with you in the mix.  That's a major asshole move.  "

All I can suggest is communicate communicate communicate.  He's either uninformed or simply underestimating the effects of pregnancy.  You've got to talk it out and come to an understanding about what you expect from him.  There are lots of resources for dads-to-be, prod him onto /r/predaddit, get him reading online materials like [What to expect for dads](http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/for-dad/landing-page.aspx), [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/baby/features/an-expectant-dads-guide-to-pregnancy), hell even the [US government](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/fatherhood/append_e_1.cfm) has tips for being a supportive partner.  There are also lots of books specifically targeted at him that go into lots of detail, or if he's not the research type consider asking his dad or yours to talk to him about being supportive during pregnancy.

The big picture that he has to understand is that when your partner is pregnant you don't get to go on with business as usual.  Daddies-to-be have their own ""symptoms"" to deal with, and even if they don't understand what's happening, they should understand what they can expect and how they are expected to cope.

It's important to have these conversations in a non-accusatory way, stay calm, pick a neutral time and setting.  Don't try to defend yourself, we can be monsters to live with and we're trying, but it isn't in our control.  Give specific tasks, you need him to do the lifting, handle raw meat, clean the litter box, not engage when you're irrational.

You get some people thinking like this, now you have a black market excess, and once enough people are part of the supply, they will influence the legal supply and likely drive the price way down.

Katana's are what I call a ""soft"" sportbike, it's a bit like having a V6 Mustang. They have all the looks, but are lacking in actual performance. That doesn't mean they are horrible as vehicles, but their components just aren't as good as the ""proper"" sportbikes (GSXR, Ninja 600+, CBRR, R6/R1, etc). Generally this means that the suspension is a bit soft and flexible, the engine is a bit slow, and the brakes are a bit oldschool. Again, this is all relative to a ""top of the line"" sportbike. 

For a general bike that can handle corners better than a cruiser, it will work just fine. 600cc's is also more than enough to have ""fun"" on.

If you did not know thier faith you could assume they were Christian and would judge them accordingly.  They could act in just like how some one would think another Christian would act.  Doing good in thier community, donating to the poor, just being a good neighbour and friend.  When it comes to light that they are a member of the Church of Satan it would not change the good they have done.  It would not change thier friendly nature or diminish thier donations to local charities.  Nothing about the person changed...all that changed is your perception.

If I never came out an an atheist people would just assume I am Christian and go about thier day.  What I believe does not change anything I have done, who I am or what I will do.  The only thing that changes is how some one else preceives me.

I would ask why is it different after finding out they don't have faith?  My wife while we were dating had this problem that took almost 2 years to for her to reconcile.  She had a lifetime of people telling her that she could only have a life with some in following Jesus.

This isn't true, though. I work for a municipality. Police aren't guaranteed the revenue from their fines. That money is usually available for general government services, unless directed differently by the elected official in charge. Everyone has to justify budgets, though, and different governments require and value different types of justification. Generally, that justification comes from requirements set by elected leadership, or passive tradition rubber-stamped by elected leadership.

In general, bureaucrats have a bit of room to set small priorities and propose new directions, but the initial action or approval for anything big (which includes the use of revenue fir specific purposes) is explicitly dictated or implicitly accepted by elected officials or the law."

You've gotten to enjoy other women - alone, without your wife  in addition to with her - for years now.  There's a ton of self-sacrifice and martyrdom in your post.  You've done all this for her, only for her - sure you got to enjoy it too but it's for her!  You need to come clean with yourself a bit about the fact that you've gotten something out of it too, and it is inherently a bit of an unfair situation - an unfair situation that works for some couples, which is great, but it's obviously not your wife's ideal.  

Basically, she's just trying to communicate with you and you're making it all about you, your hard work, your stuff.  Instead of putting yourself in her shoes.  You both know that you can have sex with other people without diminishing your love for each other, so why does her attraction to other men create such a crisis for you emotionally?

I think you need to sit and really process your feelings - separate out what's really going on that's making you so insecure about her desires - before deciding what the two of you will do.  Right now you're squarely in defensive, ""I'm hurt"" mode - which is normal, but not a good place to negotiate or discuss from. "

Neebat,worldnews,1389806675.0,"The trouble is not supply and demand.  It's a problem of identifying who your end-users are with digital content.

Today, the government is attempting to enforce identifying end-users through the distribution networks.  This is what the DMCA in the US is all about.  This does not work.  One end-user can put a digital art out to millions more through Torrent.  We cannot control all potential distribution networks, so that's useless to identify who is using the work of an artist.

We need to find a way to get those end users to identify themselves independently of where the media came from.  So when you download Gigli from ThePirateBay, there is still some connection between the buyer (consumer) and the seller (author).

The free market can't solve this, because it's a communication problem.  The owner of the digital content has no way to learn that someone has consumed it.

If we create that connection, somehow, independent of distribution, THEN the free market for digital content can operate and supply and demand will work.  It won't work without the communications."

Your point 2 

has to do with the can o worms theory with the current spouse and jealousy. 

BUT it is the current wife that wants the contact and support to take place. 

AND the OP question made no mention of any ongoing support issues, which would be- from what- I read be only on the insistence of the current wife.

point 3

You are far from young but I am 17 years older than you. 

I have survived open heart surgery, broken bones, two bad divorces and have cancer. I also have a new great relationship, and would do what OP is asking about in a heartbeat if my current partner wanted me to.

Despite the ugliness of both breakups, and the financial costs I bore, and the feelings of betrayal over her cheating and the lies that took place, there WERE reasons I liked and admired these women. That part of our past relationships is something I would focus on, plus the Christian doctrine that any person can be redeemed. 

Not that I am Christian. But any religion will do. Go ask an Imam, a Rabbi, a Buddhist monk or your choice of shaman. Forgiveness and nurturing is the way to internal peace if you can find it in your heart. It makes for better relationships too.

Also the reply I gave was to the original post about a one time visit, not about a longer term nurturing situation.

Focus on the questions, read them twice before answering. Keep on learning, you will be surprised about what you still don't know. I learned plenty about loss, anger, jealousy  and forgiveness between the ages of 53 and 70."
sparklekitteh,bipolar,1389806995.0,"Here are the things I've learned over the past ~15 years of mental illness. Hope they can be of some help.

**DEPRESSION:**


* Force yourself to get out of the house every day, even if it's just to go to the grocery store (one with self-check so you don't need to talk to anybody) and buy a bottle of juice. Becoming a hermit makes things worse in the long term.
* Find a routine and stick to it. Everybody's need for structure varies, but if waking up at 8, eating a PB&amp;J for lunch, and then taking a walk on the same route helps you, then by golly go for it.
* I find list-making to be extremely helpful. Write a list of everything that's bothering you, everything you're worried about, etc. and then walk away for a bit. You can work on those things if you want, or you can just get it out of your head and forget about it for a little while.
* Distract yourself with whatever little things work. Paint your toenails, read a cheezy pulp novel, watch videos of kittens on YouTube. If you can think about something else, it can help.
* If you have thoughts of hurting yourself (or worse), please please PLEASE talk to somebody. Call a friend, family member, or confidential crisis line. Reach out on Reddit. Call 911 if you have to. Embarassment is nothing compared to hurting yourself.


**MANIA:**


* MEGA IMPORTANT RULE: 3 days with no sleep is time to call your doctor. NO MATTER WHAT.
* If you have a benzo (Xanax, Ativan, etc.) and general permission from your pdoc, this is when you may need to use it-- but not in large doses. Follow your doctor's guidance on this one.
* Exercise is your friend: running/walking, yoga, Zumba, whatever you can manage. Tire your body out and your brain will follow.
* Showers are a great way to calm down, especially when you've got the skin-prickles or brain zaps. Put some essential oil in the shower too, I like lavender and eucalyptus, to help also.
* Channel your energy. Get creative, write a book, paint a picture, crunch numbers, be productive.
* Be safe. Avoid the drugs/alcohol and find someone to keep you accountable if possible. If you go hypersexual, toys are your best friend. (Seriously, those with female parts should invest in a high-quality rechargable vibrator.) If you spend money, have someone take your credit card or change your PayPal password so you can't dig yourself into a debt hole. Make these sorts of plans in advance.


**GENERAL:**

* Take your meds everyday. If you have trouble remembering, set an alarm on your phone.
* Don't run out of refills on your pills. Set up auto-refills at the pharmacy if you can, and see if they can be mailed to your home if possible (in case you're too depressed to go to the drugstore).
* Set up recurring appointments with your pdoc. Even if you don't feel like you can call for an emergency appointment, if you have something scheduled each month, you'll be able to get in for a regular update soon-ish.
* EAT. When you feel out of whack, food sometimes gets neglected too, and your brain needs food. I keep a stash of protein bars and juice boxes, so brain protein
* Give yourself permission to ignore other people's advice if they don't know what you're dealing with. Telling you to ""get over it,"" ""pray for Jesus to heal your sadness,"" or telling a story of someone who was sad when their cat died won't do you any good, and you have permission to smile and nod and forget it. Every person, every brain, every experience is different; do what works for you. On the other hand, your doctor knows what he/she is doing (usually, hopefully). Follow his/her medical advice."

I hated this system. Everyone could tell I was smart. Everyone always asked me ""Why don't you try harder. You know more about this subject than any of the other students.""

I wanted to punch every last one of them.

I wanted to say ""If you want me to succeed, you'll have to change the system! I am not failing because I am not trying. I am failing because I am at a significant disadvantage. My classmates have the precision to write by hand. I do not. 

My disadvantages are not sufficiently addressed. Because I am 'smart', no one believes that I need as much help to get where I should be as I do. Moreover, because systems to help those who need it are almost always set up to allow students to produce *average* results, they don't do me any good."" 

But I never did. 

I just apologized. I couldn't fight every person I ever met. I pretended that I *just. didn't. care.* And in that sense, I fit into their preconceptions. A student that didn't care. 

That was a thing they understood. So they thought they understood me, and they didn't spend time focusing on the thing that was my greatest shame. 

Perhaps they would have done something if I'd let them in.

But... when it began, I was afraid. 

Somewhere along the line, I'd lost my ability to pretend not to care. 

I'd started taking online classes.

And today, I'd seen the first results. 

A little, tiny uptick in my GPA. 

I could feel the noose of being without a future loosing a little as I saw the number change.

But for the first time in my life, I didn't feel ashamed of that number.

I was angry. Because I knew now that it was truly never my fault at all.

(For anyone wondering, this isn't *entirely* fiction. My own person experiences with junior high school were largely those of struggling with my ADHD and inability to write by hand, which, together, meant that I almost never turned in homework, even though I probably did enough that I could do decently in the classes, I always lost all of it, or had to maintain incredibly complicated systems of organization to do basically a thing another student would only need a notebook to do, which caused me to fail throughout junior high.

My failures in college, however, I place squarely on my own shoulders, largely on my expectation that I would fail.)"

bananaruth,todayilearned,1389807068.0,"I would like to see some sources for the statistics you are citing here. Especially the group bias stats.

Just because the electorate is mostly women, does not mean that they will elect women or men who represent their interests. A large portion of voters know next to nothing about the candidates they vote for. Generally what they know is their political party and their name. You know as well as I do that politicians have a huge advantage as an incumbent. They can commit crimes and still be reelected. If they pass a law that harms *anyone* they are unlikely to be voted out of office unless it is truly appalling and well publicized. Additionally, not all women support having a woman as president. 

I don't assume that men can't represent women's interests. What I do know is that they can't  completely understand those interests any more than I can really understand what it's like to be a man. What I am saying is that there are politicians like [this guy](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/09/12/831151/state-rep-why-abortion/) who clearly does not understand the issues that women face. Despite this interview, he's likely to be reelected. Not every man has these extreme views and many are capable of great amounts of empathy, but there will still be little things that they just can't understand. Being a man and being a woman are very different experiences.

skgoa,formula1,1389807101.0,"&gt; Do teams have to build brand new chassis after a regulation change, or can they, lets say, just use the 2013 car and modify it to suit 2014 rules? Would it be cheaper? 

Most of the time they will have to build an entirely new car. Even if we ignore for a moment that the new regulations make the old cars illegal, the cars are optimized for a certain formula of regulations. When the regulations change the optimal car will automatically be something different. 

The carbonfiber-on-aluminium-honeycomb monocoque (aka. the ""tub"") also is undergoing quite strong forces when on the track and will warp or even crack after too many stress cycles. Teams produce a dozen or so monocoques over the course of a year.


&gt;Why didn't McLaren go back to MP4-27 last year when they saw that the MP4-28 was too slow?

The story behind the MP4-28 is somewhat strange and has only come to light fully very recently. Basically, the MP4-27 was the best car in 2012 but over several weeks during the middle of the season the McLaren design teams couldn't find more performance. They had refined the same basic design philosophy for 1,5 seasons by that point and had just recently found that it worked even better on the track than it did in the windtunnel. That doesn't sound like much of a problem but it's actually pretty frightening for an engineer because it shows that you don't understand your windtunnel as much as you thought you did.

So they panicked and decided to build an entirely new car for the next year. All the other teams just refined their cars for the last season before the massive regulation change. So McLaren were at a disadvantage form the start, because they didn't have a car that was nearly as refined as their competitors. Just look at the front wings Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes brought to the track! Now, it's unclear if the MP4-27 actually was maxed out or if the MP4-28 was that bad a car in itself but the lack of refinement and the lack of setup experience meant that McLaren was in trouble. Going back to the MP4-27 wouldn't have given them the massive amount of CFD and windtunnel time back that they had spend at that point. They ended the last season with the MP4-27 being more or less on par with the RB8 overall. Months later the RB9 would definitely be quite a step ahead of that level of performance and both Ferrari and Mercedes were likely to also have made such a sizable step forwards. And once the pre-season tests had concluded, there was practically no chance to get data outside of the race weekends themselves, so by that time they were locked into the car they had anyways. Thus bringing the MP4-27 back wasn't a viable option.

They might actually have made it back to the front over the course of the season, as McLaren have done several times in the past. But instead they decided to take their time to learn what exactly went wrong in their windtunnel and they gave up on the 2013 season very quickly altogether, in order to focus on 2014. "

I get that you're trying to wrap your head around potentially changing the entire structure of your relationship so far, and that's scary.  But you also don't necessarily have to.  You may be taking her just sharing her feelings and opinions about it as something she's actively trying to institute.  It doesn't sound like she's trying to force you to become completely polyamorous right this very instant, although I understand you're scared that is what she wants.

I would still consider trying a MMF threesome.  So what if you'd get nothing out of it?  What about doing it for her?  Finding a guy is easy for those situations, even submissive guys (that's totally a kink of lots of guys, btw).  There doesn't have to be any contact between you and the other guy.  You can have the rules in place you want and tailor that first experience to be as close to your comfort zone as possible.  But who knows?  Maybe you'd enjoy seeing your wife enjoy another guy, too.  It's something to consider, as a one-off thing, at least, if you decide to try to negotiate this together.

XSE is a a scripting editor either based on or expanding upon Rubikon the first script editor released by the elitemap team, and Pokescript, a script editor that aimed to improve on Rubikon. At that time there were a lot of commands missing from their syntax and they were very buggy.

So how XSE works is it takes a line by line script and converts it into hex. Each command corresponds to an in game table where ASM routines handle the command and the arguments given. So when compared so C++ and Java it's actually a lot More simple because you aren't dealing with a bunch of functions and imports. Just one command per line writing data to the ROM.

To make things even more simple XSE created command aliases, making scripts both more readable as well as writable. Some of these aliases include msgbox (which is usually a load pointer followed by a callstd), a wildbattle which is usually two commands, one to load and one to execute, and several others.

As for a follow me system, its definitely possible, as in, its not a hardware limitation. Its mostly an matter of creating a system in ASM to handle the following. I might actually see about making one but that will come at a later time."

Matthew 10:28
Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.

Matthew 19:29
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.

Mark 10:17
[ The Rich and the Kingdom of God ] As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

Luke 10:25
[ The Parable of the Good Samaritan ] On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

John 3:36
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them.

John 12:25
Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.

John 10:28
I give them eternal life

So not only corroborated by all the different writers of the new testament, there is not one mention of an eternal soul in the entire bible

if you want to know more, I would suggest doing some keyword searches on bible reference sites for stuff like ""eternal life"" or ""hell"", its quite compelling.

That last was awesome. You are finally speaking my language, but you seem to be using the words in a way that suggests you don't entirely know what you are talking about. I guess my half-talk isn't helping either, so i'm willing to ignore it and try to get to the point.

Let's just stick to USA numbers and facts, since we both live here and there is no point in arguing that the hordes driving unicorns and Royal Enfield's in India make up the bulk of your mc efficiency numbers.

---------------------------------

&gt; how much utility is gained by the extra features on a large SUV/car/truck when 90% of your driving is commuting and most of that is by yourself?

is this the average usage of a car? can you please provide the same for motorcycles? on average, what percentage of trips on motorcycles are for commuting, etc?

&gt; Having the utility doesn't make value, using the utility creates value.

Exploitation is where the value comes from, but *intrinsic value* is found in all things, fully utilized or not. Why do the swed's spend so much time claiming a frozen mountain chain? because of the *intrinsic value* of the minerals within the mountains. Even though they can't exploit it now, the ability to potentially exploit the *intrinsic value* in the future creates ACTUAL VALUE now. 

But in the short term B/C ratios are what drives the process of valuation. And since B(enefit) is subjective, each persons B/C is different, so any assumptions about others reasons based on ones own calculations is invalid.

&gt; Average fuel economy of cars for 2013

Find me this stat on motorcycles before you lump all cars in that group.

&gt; Can you site a source for the average mileage figure for instance?

http://www.ridetowork.org/files/docs/Trans_Facts.html

""Average mid-size Motorcycle	 35-40 mpg""

IMProO, fuel economy stats are all made up. Even the ones people claim for their bikes are skewed or biased. And no one that rides a motorcycle is less than perfectly economical with their throttle control, right? No one EVER races their engines and blasts between stop lights. No one warms up a bike for 5 mins for a 10 min commute do they? I mean, we can just ignore all those OLD bikes, harleys, etc. Right? 

Let's both draw brackets around our portions of the argument and attempt to limit the others arguments to prove our respective points...

&gt; I might be an outlier in Tennessee

Please, Tennessee isn't all that different from the DC area. People still drive to work, park, work, drive home. Take trips, get groceries, run errands, etc.

&gt;You're obviously adamant in defending your position by not looking at the entire cost to operate the vehicle and even personally decided not to buy a car fro your personal use. That's fantastic. Doesn't change operational realities.

Seriously? i could say precisely the same thing to you, and not change a word, and it would apply just the same. just change the implied meaning of *vehicle* from ""car"" to ""motorcycle"".

-----------------------------------

in the end, we are both right and both wrong. You are wrong in my paradigm, i'm wrong in yours. FUCK IT. If you don't see it my way and i don't see it yours after all this, then we have agree to disagree.

When motorcycling is as popular in the USA as driving cars is, then we can start looking at the numbers. As you saw on that ride-to-work [site](http://www.ridetowork.org/), if everyone that owned a bike, took it to work (assuming they aren't currently, mind you) then we would save gas and money as a whole, just based on fuel economy. But that's not gonna happen, so it might as well be irrelevant and false. 

Statistics, the elegant mathematics. Isn't it lovely being able to prove or disprove anything!"

&gt; I respectfully disagree. Hollow points are more popular in defensive use because they can mortally wound people more effectively. While it would be much more likely to destroy limbs and such because of how it expands, no one aims for limbs on purpose. A torso shot from a hollow point would be much more likely to end the fight then one from a regular jacketed bullet. While the maiming you're talking about may happen, it's not the purpose of the hollow point.

&gt; Same thing with the anti-personnel mines- while there is an increase in maiming, they use shrapnel to increase the effective blast radius. A mine without shrapnel would have to be much bigger in order to create the same type of spread.

&gt; Unrelated, but I think serrated bayonets are banned for the exact reason you're describing.

&gt;The Wedding of River Song remains exactly the same. The Doctor thinks he has been clever and is inside the Tesselector, so River goes through with it and shoots him. Except this time instead of flashing to inside the Tesselector with the Doctor waving, we flash to inside the Tesselector and see that it did not work, and miniature Doctor is killed just the same. River thinks the plan worked, that he is still alive. But really the Doctor dies all alone, seeing the futility of his actions to change a fixed point. Just as he is about to die, he sees a crack on the wall. He does not know who is on the other side, but he wants to have some company, any company when he dies. When he tries to communicate, it is revealed Gallifrey is on the other side, and he gets a new set of regenerations, just like TotD. Amy and Rory both think he is dead and never find out differently. The 50th still happens all the same only with Capaldi instead.

I got bills from the hospital, the doctor, and the radiology department. Like $250 from the doctor, including a fee for seeing them after hours (11p- 6a) or something like that.

Without a whole lot more detail this is kind of a crap-shoot for us, but, based on context clues, I doubt you're using a WINS server, the default gateway should be the IP address of your firewall, and the subnet is probably just 255.255.255.0 because nothing more complicated has been set up. DNS address should be the IP of your domain/DNS server, which could be anything, but is probably similar to your printers: 192.168.1.???

To get an idea what you're dealing with, log in to a networked computer and in the run prompt type ""cmd"" without the quotes and hit enter. This will bring up the command prompt/terminal. In the window, type ""ipconfig /all"" without the quotes and hit enter. This will bring up a whole bunch of network information that will probably line up pretty well with the settings for your printers.

To be honest, if you don't know the network settings and you haven't been able to figure it out from google, then I'm curious why you are trusted enough to work on the network. None of my business though, of course. May I simply advise you to be careful and document your work.

It's looking kind of grim here. You're can't even move on to the next steps until you set the static IP's on the printers, but you're pretty much out of luck anyway for a solution if you expect it to be as simple as a dynamic setup. You're going to have to do some manual work to get the printers shared using static ports because that's the nature of the beast...DHCP exists for a reason! Static IP's are a PITA but necessary!

If you figure out your network settings, basically what you will do is log into the server, right-click properties for each printer, go to the ports tab and add a new standard TCP/IP port based on the printer's static IP. Share the printers on their new ports and theeyshould be available to be added to each PC on the network. You'll have to delete the old print drivers from each client PC and add the new shares manually one by one, or you can look into various batch scripting options (I learned login batch scripting from google so you can too). 

In my office we also use server 2003 for DNS and printer service. I use active directory to run a batch login script for each user. The script deletes and reconnects network shared drives, runs a separate script which deletes a list of old printer drivers, then connects static IP shared printers. It all happens behind the scenes and nobody knows it happens. This way, I can make changes to one centralized server and the changes effect the whole office when they reboot. One thing to keep in mind is that naming conventions are of particular importance when it comes to scripting and host names and printers, so be sure you do your research on there. For example, share names and printer display names are utilized in a weird way when it comes to batch scripts. This would all be much easier if we had 2008 R2 of course because of advanced group policy tools.

Good luck."

Do you think she's experienced no jealousy towards you being with other women?

I don't get why the gender of the other partner is so paramount here.  I mean, I get it in a way - through most of my relationship, we've had a ""one pussy policy"" because my husband is bi.  He was free to hook up with guys, and so I was I (actually I could hook up with girls too - totally unfair to him, lol, but he was fine with it).  We've agreed to relax that policy and I'd be ok with him seeing women now, although he hasn't shown much interest in actively pursuing that so it's no big.  If he did, I know I'd feel more jealous than I do when he's with guys.

But I also know that's irrational and would be willing to deal with it if it was something he really wanted. 

It sounds like you have a lot of anxiety, insecurity, and jealousy issues around being the only man your wife wants.  I don't know what to tell you other than you probably need to ask yourself a lot of hard questions as to why."

My mom displays all the classical traits of an narcissistic mother (n-mom). I hate going to Hershey Park because when younger, there was a period of 3 years where my parents, my little brother, and I went annually. My parents would argue every single time, sooner or later. Honestly, it was all my mother's fault, starting shit with my dad over nothing. And every year, she would promise that she wouldn't fight with my dad, but they did.

On the 3rd year, we were going back to the parking lot to go drive back home. Near the car, my little brother (who is &lt;10 year old then) says he has to pee. My parents start arguing about who'll take him, then they argue about other stuff. My dad is a soft-spoken man, and he argues aggressively, but with an inside-voice. My mom, however, has no volume control and you could sum her up perfectly as ""making a scene.""

Anyways, after arguing for 20 minutes with other people in the parking lot staring, my mom yells at my little brother (again, he is &lt;10 years old),

    ------------Trapp-------------
    Francis-Williams-Parkhurst-Barson

That said, I certainly see this as a possibility, though we have been playing a lot 4-5-1 the past few years (which makes a bit of sense with our depth at CDM), which would make me think we would stick Paladini in the CDM position allowing both him and Trapp to push forward a bit. This is something that Trapp has specifically noted that he would like to do and seems to fit Paladini's MO as well. This move would likely push Anor to the right and take Jimenez out of the starting XI.

I do, however, like the idea of getting back to a 4-4-2 like we did when still had a CDM anchor in Brian Carroll back in our heyday. I'm curious to see how Trapp could play this role. This could be a huge benefit as it would allow for a second forward and/or a more aggressive midfield."

He revealed nothing new.  However the media pushed it this time, why?  Many of his statements are blatant lies.  I do not trust someone who lies about their salary, job, and past.  Not to mention his blatant exagerations of capabilities and activities.  I assure you snowden could not tap anyone's phones.  He was a glorified it guy that was receiving bad marks and was most likely going to be fired shortly.

He took a chance at gaining fame just like manning and wikidouche.  He knew the internet wouldn't give a fuck about the truth merely the media portrayal.  Hence the result we have received.  I will say he executed that portion perfectly.  Except for his sketchy as fuck past and the early days of the scandal with his constant lies.

&gt; It seems to be a way to reduce a woman's sexuality and her active role in the situation to once again centering entirely around the male.

since I see myself as a pretty giving sexual partner.  I am always concerned with my partner's happiness/satisfaction (but maybe there is some deeper motivation: if she enjoys it, then she'll want more and I'll get more too).  Is that an unfair way to think?  As long as everyone is winning, I don't see a problem.

It's safe to say that one of the other effects of a learning that a woman has had ""too many"" partners, is that sex (and I) feel less special."

zhrusk,rpg,1389809469.0,"Longtime Savage Worlds GM with some experience in GURPS and currently running a Fate game here. I'll try my best to be neutral, but my current favorite system is Fate, so I will be a bit biased.

&gt; Do either of these systems get close to GURPS in terms of character detail?

Yeeees... and no. FATE will not have the same level of character detail as GURPS when it comes to what the character is capable of. Skills are broader, and aspect tags let you be good at a broad swath of things that are largely justified at the time you get the bonus (""Well, my character is a knight of the cross, so it would make sense that he would know about his enemies tactics. I spend a fate point and get a +2.""). Savage Worlds is a much crunchier system, with more streamlined rules for pulpy combat, but less rules for other character aspects. Neither system has the detail that GURPS offers. 

I seem to remember a skill list that included Musical Composition, Musical Influence, and Musical Instrument as separate skills that had to be bought separately to represent different types of performers. In Savage Worlds, this is all covered, along with singing, dancing, oratory, etc, in the Performance skill.

How I would cover it in Fate would depend on the game. If music isn't important to the game, but a player wanted to have a musician, I would require one of her aspects to be about her music, and she could invoke it anytime she wanted to do something with music. If Music is key to the game, but not the whole focus, I would create a single Music skill, and let people take ranks in it. If Music is the heart and soul of the game, and everyone is going to be a musician, I would probably separate it into different catagories based on what was most important to the game.

&gt; Is combat done well in these system or have additional rules for combat?
Savage Worlds combat is crunchy, fast, and freeloose. Skill in combat is relegated to two skills, Fighting and Shooting, Toughness as a Stamina stat, and feats to provide extra rules and specialization for each character.

Fate combat is very cinematic. Players can create and invoke aspects to represent part of the combat scene, and use them to good descriptive effect. As an example, during an Indiana Jones game I was running, a firefight broke out in a bar. One of the players spent his action to knock down a table and form a barricade, which created the aspect ""Table Cover"" (*cough*). The Nazi's they were fighting spent a Fate point to lock the party down there with fire, and I described them using cover fire to keep them behind the table. The player than decided to turn the Table Cover aspect into a Rolling Cover aspect by claiming that the table he knocked over was in fact round,and started rolling it towards the exit.

&gt; Which of these systems inherently creates better stories? (I'm aware that this question has more to do about the group then the system)

You're correct. A good group can make a good story regardless of system, but some systems make that job easier. I would say if your group relies on you, the GM, to provide all the detail of the world and simply exists within the world itself, then Fate might not be for them. Fate relies on a group that enjoys contributing to the world. It's character and World creation rules explicitly state that the players can and should create organizations, countries, NPC's, etc

Savage Worlds tends to create fast paced, action games. It's an ideal system for a group that doesn't have a lot of time to game or a GM that doesn't have a lot of time to GM. It's ruleset outside of combat is limited, however.

&gt; Which system has a bigger fanbase of settings and conversion?

The two have about the same number of settings, but in a different way. Savage Worlds has a huge set of settings provided by fans and the writers with details for people and places provided, so if you're looking for a setting you can jump into, Savage Worlds might be better. Fate, on the other hand, has a pile of setting ideas in it's [Fate Worlds] books. Fate settings tend to lay out some basic ideas for the setting (extra rules to support a style of play and broad explanations of locations and people), and let the players and GM fill in the blanks to create a world of their own.

Which one would you recommend?

For you? If you're like a lot of GURPS players I know, you like having detailed rules and solid, laid out settings that the players can live in, with Rules and GM having final say on any actions that can be done. If you are like that, Fate probably will not be for you, but Savage Worlds might be a quicker RPG you can use for action games. If you're looking to break more into an artsy-fartsy ""RPG's as a Story"" system, then FATE is a great system to do that in.

**TL:DR GURPS to Savage Worlds or Fate: You lose a LOT of detail in rules either way. With Savage Worlds, you get a light, action and combat oriented system that rewards cool moves and pulpy fights. With Fate, you get an loosey goosey system that emphasizes player contribution to world and story and ruling on what feels right at the time. All three systems are good, but in very different ways.**"

Where does that leave us?  Either we drop the claim to know anything at all, or we accept that when we say ""I know X"" we allow for the possibility of some strange but sufficiently ulta-improbable edge cases where our knowledge turns out to have been false.

I feel totally confident in the truth of the statement ""there is no God,"" so I accept it as knowledge.  I have as much basis for claiming that knowledge as I do for similarly improbably assertions like ""there is no population of microscopic paleontologist cows that live on the 3rd moon of Jupiter"" or ""there is not a magic invisible umbrella above my head reciting silent poetry in dutch right this instant.""

And anyway, same question back to religious people regarding the existence of Gods that aren't a part of their religion.  How can they for example accept the existence of the Christian God but deny the existence of Hindu, Shinto, Norse, Greek, Egyptian etc gods?  Are they all agnostics too?"

Jobs not going to the correct printer suggests a unique type of problem where either man or machine is getting confused.

Things to consider:

1) Printer descriptions and share names should be unique. Check that on the server by right-clicking printer properties.

2) If the printers are the same model and use the same driver software, you can ""install"" the server-side software once, but unique instances will have to be set up for each piece of printer hardware on the server so that client PC's can see the printers as separate entities. The network only sees a difference when it comes to the ports (USB, LPT, TCP/IP, etc.) that data is being sent through. In other words, on the server, make sure you actually have two separate entities available and that you are not just installing the same device twice on the clients.

3) Make sure that you are cleanly reinstalling each printer on each client (manually or through automation) after making changes. 

4) Make sure that users aren't confusing themselves by using naming conventions that make sense.

You've stipulated the truth of the only three premises that lead to your conclusion aka you've begged the question.

Back to logic school with you cowboy.

Here's a counter-argument for you to chew on.

Anti-God is a spirit that has no parts, and has only the property of checking to see if there is a God in the universe, and, if there is, Anti-God destroys God then destroys itself. 

Prove to me that Anti-God doesn't exist, using only a proof which cannot also be applied to prove the non-existence of God.

In what way is a mutually benefiting act between two people selfish?

&gt;It has to have a point because it is recognized by the government and hold a prominent place in culture as well. If it was ""whatever"", then no one would care enough to require signatures or provide ramifications for it.

No it doesn't have to have a point. The only point needed is that two consenting people want to get married. The care is there because the government controls the benefits I have listed before. 


&gt; Stating what they do does not say anything about why they do it. The FDA inspects businesses and collects data, but the ""why"" is to protect the food supply and protect people from illness.

You do have a point here. But you need to ask the government why they provide those benefits, but don't try to exclude people from getting them with your view.

&gt; I'm not doing those things.

Yes you were. I said that it is up to people to decide how they want to express their marriage and person love, and it might not be with kids and you replied saying. ""Yeah, and the NFL isn't only expressed by football"" and with your obsession with married people having kids its clear saying how their marriage should be manifested in the relationship

&gt;Gay couples aren't given the same rights because they don't have the same use. They are just as good as any good friends, any siblings, any close family, but that doesn't make them needing marriage. John Doe should have signed a medical power of attorney form if he cared so much. The hospital should also review their visitation rights policy.

No you aren't even recognizing gay couples as couples. They are not just the same as friends, siblings, or close family. They are in a romantic and presumably sexual relationship with that person, leading to an understanding that those other people don't have.

&gt; John Doe should have signed a medical power of attorney form if he cared so much. The hospital should also review their visitation rights policy.

You shouldn't punish people on what ifs, I'm sure the majority of heterosexual couples don't have a medical power of attorney signed before an accident happens. The issue is that the significant other is automatically given that power, when in gay couples they are not. What happens if John Doe is unconscious then he can't sign it and his significant other can't visit him or make decisions on his treatment.

&gt; The hospital should also review their visitation rights policy.

That would be nice, but the hospital doesn't need to do that. Allowing them to marry would make that a non issue."

The Penalty Box, befitting its name and location, has a mural on almost all of the walls showing what it might have looked like being on ice during the Miracle on Ice: US's Olympic defeat of the CCCP's hockey team.

The artist's style for the players was pretty normal, compared to how he stylized the people in the stands behind the glass. These creepy demonic faces leer at the players in what is supposed to be joy and amazement, but instead gives the viewer the willies.

Peppered throughout the mural's audience are many wonders. Apparently (and I couldn't see it to verify myself) there's a woman shown taking off her pants (with 80's appropriate illustrated bush plainly visible) but the huge 60"" projection TV is in that corner, hiding the profanist of illustrations. Elsewhere the people are drawn with strange proportions or in a variety of acts: some holding their arms up in victory, some hanging their head in defeat - or is that guy bent over leaning against the boards while the guy directly behind him gives him anal sex?!

It was an education experience.  At the time I was talking these classes I was an out of the broom closet Pagan.  I never had any issues discussing with my religious classmates about thier or other faiths.  The class was great, you learn about all these other faiths and it can even strength your resolve in atheism.  Comparing and contrasting all these different faiths and pointing out how traditions from what would seem to be completely different faiths are infact almost the same.

It really depends on your professor though.  Mine taught the course material and did it all in a matter of fact style.  He never indulged with his own faith, never belittled other faiths.

Julian also is a fan favorite at the club and one of our homegrown players. This is important, because selling Draxler in the winter for his release clausel or less would be political suicide for Heldt and Tönnies.
It would also be financially unwise to sell him during the winter period because we dont have a replacement for him yet. Meyer doesnt really fit on the wing, neither does Boateng. Holtby, who we are apparently intrested in also doesnt fit well on the wings. Holtby is seen as Höger replacement, to lift some burden of Goretzka who is still finishing his school. So if we sell Julian in the winter, we would still need to buy a player for the wing, unless we really want to finish the season with Fuchs and Clemens there, which is doubtful. However, wether another winger is really needed is up for questioning, since we got Sam comming in during the summer window and also have Barnetta returning, who is playing great in Frankfurt.
So if Arsenal really wants to have him in the winter transferwindow they would need to pay over the buyout clausel, or very close to the buyout clausel and offer a swap. Make that 50+ million Euros, 40 million plus Podolski/Ox or 45 million + Gnabry. Sounds too much for Draxler? We are well aware that it is, but are also in a position to enforce this, because there were several clubs that were already willing to trigger the release clausel last summer and its highly unlikely that the intrest in him will fade after the worldcup.


So wether it is a good idea for Arsenal to try to get Julian in during the winter is doubtful. On the other hand, in the summer there will probably be other clubs intrested in Julian aswell. And he always said that his dream destination would be the spanish league. "

shafonfa,AskWomen,1389810159.0,"Well, first off, Jesus speaks against lust. He said that lust in your heart is the same as adultery. Assuming that one is watching porn for sexual gratification, this certainly would count as ""lust,"" which is essentially cheating and breaking your marriage vows.

Also, because we believe that sex is designed to be shared between a husband and wife and that's it, then by default it would be immoral to watch someone else engaging in sexual activity. 

And on the justice side of things, demand for pornography leads to more supply... And some people in pornography are there by direct force, coercion, and exploitation. By supporting pornography, it encourages more to be created, and not all of it is on the up and up. 

Finally, we think it creates an unhealthy attitude towards sex and sexuality. Its a very modern phenomenon to have tons and tons of pornography at ones fingertips, and its easy to escalate from typical sexual desires to things that are more and more ""out there,"" leading to dissatisfaction with your spouse."

Edgar_Allan_Rich,techsupport,1389810242.0,"&gt; I was really hoping there would be a way to 'move the printer a port over,'

Well that's basically the idea behind having them dynamically hosted. If your DHCP server is set up correctly then they never should have gotten confused to begin with, so you may have a whole other issue altogether unfortunately. Either way, static hosting should solve this particular issue.

If you know ipconfig /all then you know the network settings, so we've answered that question. Set your static IP's and you're ready to host the machines.

Telling the host device (I'm assuming printers are shared on server 2003 unit?) to serve a printer is described above, but I'll outline it again in brief. The host needs the correct driver installed and it needs to have one unique instance of a printer installed for each unique piece of printer hardware. Each of these server-based instances should be set up to receive data on a separate port...in this case a TCP/IP port set to the static IP of each printer. 

The best way to connect  the newly configured printers to client machines is a whole other consideration.

partspace,AskFeminists,1389810265.0,"If you're part of the feminist movement right now, you'd see that many feminists openly criticize other feminists. There is a huge debate right now about what is referred to as ""white feminism,"" and most 3rd wave feminists are very critical of the ""TERF"" viewpoint. We don't automatically accept and agree with all people who call themselves feminists, and we don't automatically give other feminists a pass because we're in the same club. There is plenty of infighting, trust me. (Edit to add, and don't get me started on how much I loathe FEMEN. There's tons of feminist blogs out there hating on them and everything they're doing wrong.)

As for anti-feminists, they will always search through feminism, ignoring the moderates in search of a wild outlier to discredit the entire movement. It's a tactic used to keep the status quo and ignore the real issues of gender inequality.

It's a common problem with no real solution. Anti-feminists come in biased and look for someone to fit their strawman. There could be 100 feminists loudly shouting, but we're all ignored in favor of that one crazy ball-chopping ~~radical~~ extremist. We're even ignored if we agree that the crazy ~~radical~~ extremist viewpoint is wrong. (Edit again, I need to stop conflating those terms.)

People who believe that this is typical of the feminist viewpoint are *wrong*. But they won't bother looking for the truth. It's a closed minded, willful ignorance that is tremendously difficult to change. Still worth trying, though. "
Blindocide,nfl,1389810271.0,"imo, abortion should be the first resort. won't even have the problem to solve, at that point.

financial abortion should also be a thing: if one parent doesn't want to have the kid and the other parent does, and the parent that wants it is able to support it by themselves, then that should be allowed to happen. the other parent would not be given custody of any sort but also wouldn't be expected to give any money.

if one parent does not want to have the child, and the other parent cannot support it, abort it. shouldn't make problems when you don't have to make problems.

because as it stands now, you accidentally spill a little fluid and a woman can be like [""Gotcha, bitch!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uldc1oXpMCE) and now you're at her mercy, regardless of how you think or feel as a human being.

There's only a finite amount of spectrum, that means you're naturally going to end up centralizing control of the industry.  State monopolies would maybe be sensible, but the europeans have managed  to find a model that works reasonably well without doing that.  Though of course europe as a whole has more people with more money in a lot less space than the US.  

Wireless communications have been mainstream  for  a century, I think it's pretty natural to use any resource we can exploit, and most countries allocate about 1/3rd of their spectrum to the military, so there are lots of artificial or unnecessary shortages caused by poor planning in the first place, and  the government hoarding  spectrum in case it wants it later.

Blindocide,nfl,1389810987.0,"Here's why financial abortion works:

a billionaire bachelorette gets pregnant from a man who makes 77,000 a year.

the bachelorette chooses to financially abort.

the man, who makes 77,000 a year, can support his child by himself. (don't tell me someone can't raise a child on 77,000 a year. That's double the average american income and the ceiling on quality of life) so he *does* support the child.

The billionaire bachelorette never gives a cent and never sees her kid. the father raises his child perfectly fine and may even find another partner down the line.

nothing goes wrong.

There is nothing in financial abortion that suggests the partner with more money owns the other partner's body.

CadHuevFacial,feminisms,1389811373.0,"I agree in your stating that men are likely wanting to talk about how patriarchy affects them as well, but I'm not sure many are really aware that the source of their gender-related woes is the same set of social conventions that unfairly marginalizes women at an institutional scale. Many men seem to confuse the feminist agenda to dismantle patriarchy with their inaccurate belief that women want to 'get ahead by destroying men and all things male'. 

I understand why men may find it intimidating to enter feminist discussions about gender inequality since their only [perceived] relevant contribution is, in their minds, the way they personally experience oppression as men. I believe most feminist forums to be extremely welcoming to all genders, so long as those involved understand the major tenet of feminism is that patriarchy, **not** men themselves, is the source of gender inequality and marginalization. Posts about female-centric clothing in games absolutely have the potential to include a discussion on male-centric design choices as well, so long as the underlying discussion revolves around how *patriarchy*, not the man himself or the man-hating woman, is the source of contention. I think in order for men to feel welcome and included in the feminist sphere, they may* first need to personally come to the conclusion that/understand why patriarchy does in fact limit their freedoms. I don't know if this needs to happen in order for a recognition of privilege to take place, or if understanding personal privilege must happen before independent study of how patriarchy harms men as well. (Maybe I'm just blowing smoke up my own ass.)

Anyway, I didn't mean to dismiss the original point of discussing white privilege in feminism in all of that. While I try very hard to include the compounding marginalization women of color face when I talk about feminism, I'm still navigating the nebulous intersection between including their experience in the conversation without coming off as a self-proclaimed spokesperson/white knight. 


Would it be better for me as a white woman to not bring up women of color in the conversation at all?"

princesskiki,Dogtraining,1389811419.0,"This will be an extremely serious issue very quickly if it doesn't get under control.  People are trigger happy with pit bulls and you could very easily get sued if your dog nibbled, even playfully, on someone else that came to visit or saw her on the street.   For that reason, you should consider professional training help as soon as possible. 

Getting a dog to stop biting is all about teaching the dog that biting is a terrible thing that ends the fun.  If she bites you, you can say ""OUCH!"" really loudly, and get up and leave the room.  Teach her that if she bites...you leave and the fun ends.  This is obviously best taught when you're hanging out playing with her or doing something she loves.  The second she puts her mouth on any body part...a sharp noise (or ouch) followed by leaving her completely alone in the room.   You can come back in after 30 seconds or so and start playing again.  This will be a frustrating exercise for you because it's going to take a lot of repetitions before he understands...but it's a very important lesson.   When you leave...you leave with your back to the dog, wordlessly and not making eye contact.  You're basically teaching the dog a trick.  The trick is that if they bite you...you leave the room.  

Personally I've never had luck teaching the no-biting by giving a dog a replacement toy to stick in their mouth when they bite....so I would try the leaving the room thing first.

nullomore,AskWomen,1389811468.0,"I used to think that I was all about monogamy, but I don't feel that way anymore.

I was dating a man who had never had previous partners, so after we had been together for a long time, he began to wonder if this might be his only relationship. Of course he was curious about the vast world of sexual and emotional relationships out there. At this point, our relationship was pretty secure. We both knew all the amazing ways that we complemented each other and we both admired and loved each other. I felt pretty safe suggesting that he see other people. I knew that when he did, the initial excitement over a new relationship would feel like **FOREVER LOVE** to him because he didn't have much experience. We talked about it and how it would be normal for him to feel this way, and he should enjoy it but keep it in perspective. He should bask in the glow, but not turn it into some bitter contest like ""Oh, new girl is so much better than nullomore, geez."" We discussed all the boundaries. I wanted to know if he was seeing someone, but I don't need all the details. He needed to be 100% sure that he was using a condom with other girls. And with that, we opened up our relationship.

I was a little nervous about how I'd feel when the first girl would inevitably come along, but our relationship was going pretty well, so I didn't think about it too much. And when the news finally came about his first hookup, I was really happy for him! He seemed so excited and I could see what it was doing for his self-esteem. I thought I'd be insanely jealous, but I was just relieved that he felt so good about himself.

Anyway, to make a long story short, the experience strengthened our relationship overall because he came to appreciate me more. Before the open relationship, he hadn't had any bad relationships, so he didn't really understand just how great we had it. In the end, we closed the relationship again because he struggled too much with my seeing other people, and I was quite happy either way, so we're now monogamous again. But I would definitely do it again if he wanted to."

TheWorldIsAhead,movies,1389811697.0,"Loved John Carter. Few people know this, but John Carter is basically a live action Pixar-film. 

Andrew Stanton is a core member of the Pixar ""brain trust"" and after Nemo and Wall-E a big shot at Disney so they gave him full power over everything except marketing during the production. He decided to work with an all-Pixar creative crew so he had Pixar-people on script and production the whole way. For anyone remotely ineterested in why John Carter tanked I recommend John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood. It is one of the most fascinating books I have read on what goes into marketing a Hollywood film and how Walt Disney Pictures works. 

http://www.amazon.com/John-Carter-Hollywood-Michael-Sellers-ebook/dp/B00AFCZ1S4 

People seem to think that Walt Disney Pictures is an amazing company full of in-house knowledge on making and marketing good films, but actually curtsey of Bob Iger the focus of Disney the last ten years has been to buy lucrative IPs and make them even more lucrative. The people responsible for getting this done is actually rarely Walt Disney Pictures, but rather the big shot producers who work on these films. The success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is thanks to Kevin Feige. The success of Pirates to Jerry Bruckheimer. The success of Star Wars will be thanks to Kathleen Kennedy (and somewhat Abrams who is a big producer in his own right). Iger just buys stuff and then watches it make money. 

Carter unfortunately did not fit in with the way Disney did things, and had no big shot producer. It was marketed not by experts working for a big shot producer, but by Disney's in-house marketing team (unlike Pirates 4 and The Avengers for instance who had their own trusted teams), who were notoriously incompetent at the time and dropped the ball on film after film (The Sorcerers Apprentice, Mars Needs Moms and to a lesser extent Tron: Legacy for example). 

It's really interesting and I highly recommend it. "

brokenhyoid,changemyview,1389811706.0,"The title is pretty heavy handed. I guess it really depends on what you would define as being ""Okay"". 

I think the problem, regardless of how the audience receives the joke, is that **you're perpetuating a specific point of view that probably reinforces negative stereotypes.** And it's also not very likely that every human being listening in on the joke is okay with it, as well, so it wouldn't be wise to assume that you're always in the company of people who share your sense of humour. 

When my family members tell racist, homophobic and sexist jokes with one another in my presence, most will laugh or even follow it up with their own humour. Now if I laugh and go along with it, regardless of how I might really feel about it, I'm only enforcing the notion that what they've said is okay or even worse, that it's factual (as most jokes, at least good ones, are based on something factual - laughing at a joke tends to confirm that). And when you allow that sort of mentality to flourish without instilling any doubt or without offering any opposition to make them question what they've said, that mentality can become a personality (and personalities lead to actions). The joke might be funny and hell, it might even be a good joke, but you should be wary about who you're laughing along with. I find that people who laugh along to negative jokes tend to be people who are only reinforcing their actual beliefs. Also you should be conscious of whether the joke is just poking fun at something, or if it's actually causing harm, for example a black joke about poverty does harm to the black community by perpetrating the notion that black people cause their own poverty, whereas a black joke about grape soda doesn't do anything but to reinforce a lame lighthearted stereotype. See the difference? 

Also I think it's telling that you wouldn't shout an abortion joke to the general public, but you're comfortable enough to subject your friends to it, if you wouldn't want the world to hear it perhaps it's not that great of a joke. "

princesskiki,Dogtraining,1389811747.0,"Set aside a word.  Something that you don't say in regular conversation. Preferably a one or two syllable word.  

Let's say our word is KING.  You're now going to teach the dog that KING means treat.  Go get your bag of treats when the dog is watching...they know what to expect from that bag...and give him a treat while saying KING.  Keep saying KING and giving him a treat, asking nothing from the dog.   All you want to do is teach the dog that KING means treat.  Pretty quickly you should be able to get him to walk over to you when you say KING.  You MUST give the dog a treat every single time you say KING.

Keep doing this...at least once or twice a day...saying KING and getting the dog to come get a treat.  The dog should basically just think that KING means there's a cookie waiting for him.  NEVER use the word to get him for something he doesn't want to do (get his nails trimmed, go to the vet, go get a bath, etc.).   Just continue to use the word KING frequently to reinforce the treat getting.


Eventually you will be able to use this very same word to get your dog to come to you in situations where you need to get your dog to come to you.  You should still make sure that 98% of the time when you use the word....all you're doing his giving him a treat....and you should practice it outside as well with treats.    

The only real problem with ""come"" is that most people use that word and then promptly have the dog do something that it doesn't want to do.  Come, to dogs, ends up meaning bath, vet, hair brushing, playtime is over, we're leaving the dog park, etc.  They hate that word and they grow to hate it very quickly.  By using your word exclusively for treats...you've taught your dog a very different thing."

OswegoWriter,WritingPrompts,1389812402.0,"I had known and loved my son his entire life, and then some. 

I cut Jason's umbilical cord when he was born. After my wife left, I ended up raising him alone. I taught him how to throw a baseball, and how to disassemble a carburetor. (We were working on the ""reassemble"" part when he died.) I took him to Washington one summer, to show him his grandfather's name inscribed in black marble, and to show him that there were some things worth dying for. I didn't guess at the time that he would take that literally. Or personally. When I think of that trip, I try to remember things like the Smithsonian and the Capitol tour where we bumped into our Representative. But it doesn't help, because I still feel guilty about it.

At the funeral-- and ever since, for that matter-- people kept telling me that Jason died in service to his country. The President paid us a visit and told us that he died bringing freedom to Iraq. I told him about the trip to D.C. and the President said to me-- direct quote-- ""that must be where his desire to serve his country came from."" I know he meant well when he said it, but ever since then, I wondered if he'd still be with me if we had gone anywhere else in the world.

So it was a bit of a surprise when, three years and some change after he died in Fallujah, he appeared, fall-down drunk, on my front porch.

It was early Saturday morning sometime in the Summer, and I was drinking my morning coffee and reading the news blogs. I still remember the story on the home page: INVESTIGATION REVEALS MISSING IRAQ FUNDS. I read a lot on Iraq after Jason's first deployment there, and it's stuck with me since. I can't do it constantly; it's too wrenching sometimes, and it makes me think about Jason, and what, exactly, had he died for.

I was thinking about him when he knocked. For a brief half-second, I thought it was him, then pushed that idea out of my head. *Of course it's not him*, I'd have to remind myself. But there he was, lying on the porch.

""Hey, Dad,"" he said. I dropped my coffee and... I think I screamed bloody murder, but I don't remember. Whatever happened next, I think I was in shock. The next thing that I knew, I had dragged him to the couch. When I learned that he died, I tried to picture it as quick, clean, peaceful; but from the look of him now, it clearly wasn't any of those. His right leg was gone at the hip, half his body was covered in horrible, blackened burns from his scalp to his waist. He was covered in blood, it had left a wide smear from the front door to the living room. There were things sticking out of him: shattered bone, splinters of wood the size of my fingers, twisted metal shards. I couldn't look at him; it tore apart the fragile picture I'd drawn of him, painted to assuage my lingering guilt.

""Dad?"" he asked, his raspy voice gurgling in his throat. ""I have to tell you sumthin'. But I need a drink. I need lottsa drinks.""

""How-- how are--"" I stammered. I couldn't process what I was looking at, It was shattering everything I'd known, everything I'd been through for the past three years. I dropped to my hands and knees and vomited all over the hardwood floors. Jason just laughed.

""Alcohol. They don' like alcohol, so sometimes, when you realize what's happenin' to you, you just gotta get shitfaced an' make a run for it."" I sat back, leaning against the couch for support. My mind was beginning to focus itself again.

""Jason, *who* doesn't like alcohol?"" He grew dark and silent for a moment.

""The men with sticks and rope."" He coughed violently, spattering dark black blood into his lap. ""I need alcohol, it helps hide me from 'em."" The tone of his voice was serious, more steely and forceful than I'd ever heard him. I stood up, steadying myself as best as I could. There was a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniels in the kitchen, and three bottles of Sam Adams in the fridge. He drank it all as quickly as he could. Tiny streams of liquid began trickling out of the holes in his stomach.

""Lissen,"" he slurred, ""when you die, time gess all... like a stuck record, you know? You live your death over an' over an' over. It's terrible, but sometimes you know wass comin', and I jus' felt it one time. I couldn' take it, but it hadda be done, there wass no stoppin' it. So I got drunk and walked over that IED 'gain, but it din't go off."" He paused, examining himself. His camouflage uniform was in tatters, the flag patch on his shoulder missing. ""I sudd'nly found myself here, inna real world. Just inna front yard, like the las' thing I wass thinkin' of 'fore I died.""

""So--"" but I couldn't continue. My mind was racing, out of focus again.

""Dad. They're commin' for me, I c'n feel 'em down the road."" He pointed at the gun cabinet in the corner and nodded slowly. ""You gotta help me. I can't die again."" Again. The word echoed in my head. I loaded two rifles: one for me, one for him, then went into the bathroom.

There, on the top shelf, was the bottle I was looking for. Old pain medications from a back injury a year ago. I still had twinges every now and then, so I saved the pills and took a half every few weeks when it was necessary. I tore the cap off and counted: thirty pills, easily. I closed my eyes and began sobbing. I asked myself over and over, *was this the only way?* But I owed Jason this much.

""Where are they now, Jason?"" Even I could hear how cold my voice had become.

""Near. But they don' have my scent, I think."" I handed him the cup of coffee. *Black as night as sweet as a kiss*. His favorite way of ordering it. He looked at me for a while, puzzling out what was happening. I knelt down beside him and held his hand. It was blistered and charred, but he tightened his grasp.

""I love you, Dad."" I held the cup to his lips. I said, ""I love you too, Jason,"" as he drank it all with slow, measured gulps. *Maybe it won't be so bad this time*, I hoped."

An item of property, plant and equipment should initially be recorded at cost. [IAS 16.15] Cost includes all costs necessary to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. This would include not only its original purchase price but also **costs of site preparation**, delivery and handling, installation, related professional fees for architects and engineers, and the estimated cost of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site (see IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets). [IAS 16.16-17]

Before the site could be demolished the existing tenants had to leave, but there were costs associated with doing so, presumably because the owner had contractual obligations to the tenant which were broken.  I would personally say that is a cost of site preparation.  This is a matter of professional judgment so it's up to you to defend your position."

hrtfthmttr,politics,1389812847.0,"I upvoted you because of the general fund comment, but I did want to say something about the latter half:

&gt;However, what are the other agencies doing to generate revenue and why would I want to help them when they're lazy.

There are a ton of government services that will never be able to generate their own revenue through external activity, and nonetheless have a huge impact on you, your tax dollars, and perform activities that you would consider an imperative government service. Here are some examples:


**Internal service departments:** Governments, like businesses, have some basic functions that have to be conducted. HR, finance, acccounting, IT services, legal representation, etc. simply have to exist to pay police officers, comply with the law for places of employment, etc. (laws, I might remind you, that are in place to protect you in the private sector as well). Clerk, legal and financial activities of cities are generally geared toward protecting the tax payer from private theft and other departmental misuse of public dollars by providing information, representation, and financial oversight for the public. They actually save you money. You could outsource these, but that doesn't change the fact that you still have to pay for them, and introduces additional incentive concerns related to the use of public money by private firms.

**Low revenue services:** Another example is for services that don't generate enough revenue to be self-sustaining, but people routinely value. Parks, and recreational activities are perfect examples that charge use fees, but not enough to cover costs. Time and time again, voters pass tax increases to preserve their existence, keep parks free, and keep community activity centers cheap. And this is even if they don't use them! Just their existence provides value to taxpayers, as proven by the fact that a vote count for tax increases far outstrip actual use numbers. There's also an equity concern, where much of civil society believes certain services should be free to all (like park access), despite your ability to pay for it directly.

**Public goods, semi-public goods, and force:** Lastly, some things simply don't function well in private markets. Environmental or fire protection, public utilities, and public safety are good examples, for different reasons. Utilities are difficult because of the serious danger of monopolization, yet still function well when run as a private entity. For that reason, there is a mix of pure public utilities ranging to highly regulated private utilities in the US. For environmental protection, there is no way to ""sell"" this service, and pretty much everyone agrees it's important to spend something on it. Finally, policing is a weird one. We want protection, but almost nobody thinks it's a good idea to only provide protection to people who pay for it. Besides, it's not even a practical idea, given the spontaneous nature of crime. It's also a big deal to give private firms the legal right to perpetuate violence on people. Those powers should be restricted to public representation. Can you imagine if Blackwater could do whatever they want with a private board?

Anyway, the point is that just because an agency can't generate it's own revenue, it does'nt mean it's because of laziness."

- [There's paradoxes flying everywhere. The ""you"" that gets drowned, while having been taken back in time to the baptism, existed after it, experienced the events in the game, then was taken back in time to be drowned. Also, Elizabeth wouldn't have made the realization that you needed to be drowned at the baptism if Booker had not survived it and went on to experience the events in the game with her.](/spoiler)

- [Why are there multiple Elizabeths? Shouldn't there be one Elizabeth per Booker?](/spoiler)

- [The Elizabeth that drowns you isn't ""your"" Elizabeth - note the lack of a choker.](/spoiler)

[Based on all of this, and the fact that Elizabeth can alter reality and time at will, I posit the idea that Elizabeth(s) drown you, but at the same time somehow save you now that things have been ""set right"" and place you in a reality where you are reunited with Anna and can live a normal life. In the after-credits scene, Booker seems to have some surprise in his voice, which I interpret as surprise that everything is back to normal and that he can live his life the way he wanted to.](/spoiler)

[Further question: If Booker and Elizabeth both stop existing](/spoiler), how do they both end up in Rapture for Burial at Sea? I haven't played it yet, so maybe this is explained.

EDIT: Well, I think that Production IMS (a fairly new studio, by the looks if it) did a great job with this adaptation. It definitely gets the tone of the manga correct, though it does skip a few scenes (understandable, given that this is a one-cour series). If I had to sum up the manga in one word, it would be ""charming"", and that seems like it will apply to the anime as well. It really is one of the best comfort series. The art style of the anime was great, and I really liked the main song used as a part of the soundtrack. The scene wherein Inari is depressed and her friends cheer her up was handled brilliantly, and was one of my favourite parts of the episode. Overall, I am really looking forward to the rest of this series.

I literally just addressed this in my post. Armor calculations are factored after damage block, meaning that the amplification from negative armor will be negligible at best.

I'm not saying it makes her underpowered or useless. I'm just saying that it's too swingy of a change. If you want to nerf her, make spirits do composite damage, or reduce the damage. Maybe reduce her starting strength, strength gain, or armor.

I rebuild transmissions, if that helps."
b00tler,Christianity,1389813697.0,I was raised LCMS and my parents -- both scientists -- did not teach me YEC.  That -- and the LCMS very conservative views on the role of women -- probably had something to do with why they eventually became more comfortable in ELCA churches.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1389813704.0,"what makes you think that only melee carries would get a stout shield? if damage block worked, you can bet that every single melee hero would get a shield, since it would be the #1 cost effective way of reducing spirit damage."
Jacksambuck,PurplePillDebate,1389813710.0,"It's fun, but it's just a lifestyle choice among others.  It's not morally wrong either, even with stuff like ""negging"" (excluding things that are clearly ""rapey""). RPers shouldn't define themselves (and every other man) exclusively by how much they adopt and succeed at this. It's as stupid and reductive as defining yourself solely by how much money you make, how many books you read, or how good you are at football. Because if you lose interest, you have nothing to fall back to. 

For me, ""I've seen excitement, and I've seen boredom. And boredom was best.""

pjmccartney,PS4,1389813745.0,"I'm playing Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 right now on an emulator with the DS4. It's as close we're gonna get right now. Tokyo Xtreme Racer was the first game I got for my Dreamcast. I was expecting it to be some lame generic launch title. Boy, was I wrong.  Every kid on the block came over to my house to play it. It was so addicting and the gameplay mechanics were so unique. Even today, there is isn't a racing game quite like it. I'd love for the series to come back on a next gen console with more cars, more regions, online play and more graphical detail. "

aDDnTN,motorcycles,1389813768.0,"1) compare? it's called an [analogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy).

2) i pulled those figures from my ass, but they definitely seemed credible (FYI: anchor points). then when you asked for source, i found one that fit my data for motorcycles. statistics!

&gt; motorcycles are a perfectly acceptable form of transportation which are cheaper to operate than cars **except when you need to do something you can't do on a motorcycle, then they are as useless as tits on a boar**.

FTFY.

&gt;Ultimately you keep throwing in data that proves cars are more expensive to buy, less efficient on fuel and more expensive to operate.

this seems to be true because there isn't a lot of data that captures the limited usage and actual cost of ownership of a motorcycle, because the variability of those IS HUGE and INTANGIBLE, but that doesn't mean it's without value.

i'm not worried bro. You think it's all fixed and unchanging. You'll always work in DC and it will always be smart to ride in. You'll never have kids or need to do anything other than put around on your bike. so for you, the argument is always the same. This is generally called ""failing to update your paradigm"" or ""being left behind"" but if that means society can move past asshats like yourself, then i say ""steady as she goes!"""
