If this were true, no woman would ever have been sexually rejected by a male friend - which I can tell you from experience is not the case. Any man I've called out on this also readily admits that, now that he thinks about it, he does in fact have a few female friends he's not interested in. I suspect that most men who say these kinds of things are also the kind of men who only think of attractive women when they think of women, and thus their platonic female friends just don't spring to mind when they think about female friends.

If you truly, honestly only view women in terms of their sexual potential, then you should do some serious self-examination about the way that you're approaching life."

keypuncher,conservatives,1389171571.0,"I had occasion to take an interstate flight this past December, for the first time in several years.

I had actively avoided flying for most of the decade prior due to a number of bad experiences after 9/11/01 - one of which included taking a round trip flight with 2 connections and getting searched 5 times (three outbound and twice on the return trip).

Flying in December 2013, my experience was markedly different.  It wasn't that the security measures were any less intrusive and Orwellian than they were in 2003 - if anything they were more so (granted I wasn't pulled aside and searched this time, which was a bonus).

What I found most disturbing was how smoothly and instantaneously the travelers shifted from being free people to meekly acquiescing to intrusive security measures that would have been unthinkable 15 years ago.  If you have ever seen the 2002 movie *Minority Report*, the shift among the travelers reminded me very much of the [scene in Minority Report where spider robots are first deployed to do retinal scans to verify the identity of residents of an apartment building](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=M5dFb2x-NcA#t=4468) (at roughly 1:14:30) - ordinary people living ordinary lives.  Aside from the protagonist, there are four separate reactions to the intrusion of the spiders.  A mother with children are frightened, and the mother is trying to reassure her children while getting them through what is obviously a traumatic experience - once done she becomes angry at the officers who frightened them.  A couple interrupted mid-coitus react with shame and anger - the moment for them is lost, but they acquiesce. A fighting couple stop yelling and hitting each other and flatten themselves against a wall to allow the scan as if a switch had been thrown - and then resume their confrontation as if nothing had happened.  Lastly an old man sitting fails to even react.  In all four cases the people became completely subservient to the state to allow the spider robots to scan their retinas.  ...and then, once that moment was past, they resumed their lives.  Those four groups, in order, are an allegory for how we have reacted to the security state.  The outrageous eventually becomes the norm - at which point new outrages can be perpetrated."

One one hand, it seemed like he was intentionally milking the situation to get what he wanted and to be annoying, which seems kind of out of character for the character, but he also seemed genuinely hurt that people were avoiding him. Was ""Boyle is being a pain in the butt on purpose and taking advantage of things"" just a misread on my part? Things like enthusiastically going along with it when the others offered to let him pick out the food seem very in line with the character, but repeatedly emphasizing that the injury was almost much worse struck me as a little off."

sp00nzhx,WritingPrompts,1389171723.0,"The firefight was getting intense. Jake's squadmates were pinned down by heavy fire from the treeline. It was a killbox. Jake, the squad gunner, only had enough ammunition on his person to distract the insurgents from firing at him as he made his escape.

""Get the fuck out of here,"" he heard his sergeant scream over the din. He almost protested, but was reminded that it's an order. Jake's legs tensed up in preparation for a sudden stand and retreat.

""Wait just a second,"" Jake's voiced boomed as he sat back down. ""Me? Leave? Whoever's writing this, I'm not gonna do that.""

*A voice with a heavy Brooklyn accent came on through my speakers, cutting off the music I had playing. My character just talked to me. His words flowed across the word processing program, in neat double quotes, as if I had typed them.*

Suddenly, the voice of a god boomed down, and though it shook the ground, only Jake could hear, and time around him seemed to slow to a mere snail's pace. ""How did you do that, Jake?"" The voice was firm, but questioning.

""Hell if I know, but you put me here,"" Jake retorted snappishly. ""Look. I bet you've got some big plan for me that involves Sarge needing to die here. Maybe I've gotta be emotionally scarred for the actual bad guys to try to secure a deal with me. It's your story - well, mine too - but that's too cliche. Anyway. I'm gonna go save my squad over there. Fuck your story.""

*I could hardly believe what was happening. I could see it written out before me, though. His actions popped up in a few sentences, in my writing style. He tried to change his own narrative. He was going to save his sergeant.*

*Not if I had anything to say about it.*

Jake stood, and screamed for his squad to run over to his position. He rested his weapon on its bipod, and let out several bursts of covering fire. The sergeant made it to the other side, and thanked Jake for stupidly disobeying his orders.

Jake's legs tensed up in preparation for a sudden stand and retreat. He suddenly had an overwhelming urge of deja-vu. ""Wait,"" he complained, and crouched back down. ""I just did that!"" He twisted his face to the sky and raised his fists in two obscene gestures. ""Fuck you, you deleted the paragraph!""

""Yeah,"" the voice boomed down. ""And I'll keep doing it if you don't stop being a little shit.""

""Well then I guess you'll have to keep rewriting this scene, boss.""

""I'm God, buddy. I *made* you. I *own* you.""

""Prove it!""

Suddenly, a book fell from the sky and landed on Jake's face. He picked it up, and looked at the cover. ""Desert Silence"" was plastered on the front, by Dan Eriksen. ""Well I'll be damned.""

""Exactly."" The voice was annoyed. ""Now, if you'd kindly let me get back to my writing.""

Jake's legs tensed up in preparation for a sudden stand and retreat. ""Fuck you,"" he shouted at the sky as he ran towards his comrades.

*This looked like it would be a long night of writing indeed.*"

So thats going great.

I currently weight 116 kg. With my current and previous weight loss trend in mind, I have set a goal of 110 kg by the end of the month. To achieve this, I need to lose 300 grams of weight per day. This has certainly been doable in the past when I've stuck to the program, and possibly even more - I'm well above the average so there is room to spare if I have a bad day.

So, 110 by the end of January. I've set a goal for 105 for the end of February, and I think thats a very mild goal if I plan on losing another 6 kg by the end of january. And by the end of March, I want to finally be below 100 kg."

So there was this slightly introverted high school student who had never asked a girl to a dance. It's his senior year and he feels that he should go to prom. So he musters up the courage and asks one of his friends. She says yes. Now he has to prepare for the dance. 
The next day, he goes to buy his tickets, and there is a huge line. So he waits, and waits, and waits, then he finally gets the tickets. 
The next day, he goes with his date to go get a dress. When they get to the store, there is a huge line going out the door. So the wait, they wait, and they wait. Finally, they get to the front and buy a dress. 
After this, they go to men's warehouse to get him a suit for the dance, and there is a huge line going out the door. So they wait, wait, and wait. Finally they get in and buy a nice suit. 
The next day, he remembers that he needs to order a corsage. So he goes to the local store and there is a huge line. So he waits, waits, and waits until he gets his order in. 
Now it's the day before prom and he wakes up and realizes that he forgot to order a limo, so he calls up the limo rental place. All the lines are busy so he decides to go into the place. When he gets there, he sees the line stretching out the door and around the corner. So he waits, and waits, and waits, until finally he was lucky enough to get the very last limo. 
So now it's the night of the dance and when they get to the prom, the school is doing mandatory drug testing, so there is a huge line getting into the prom. So the wait, wait, and wait. Finally they get to the front and they both pass their drug tests. 
Now the dance was going pretty good for about a half an hour, until he really, really had to go to the bathroom. So he takes off to go, and he sees this huge line going out of the bathroom. He waits, waits, and waits until he finally takes care of his business. 
When he comes out of the bathroom, he notices that a crowd has formed around his date. She had just randomly passed out. Someone says to him, ""hey, you're her date, go get her some punch."" So he goes over to the punch table and thank god, there is no punch line.

-  Dealing with ever increasing anxiety and depression that keeps me in a nervous wreck until 5am near every night.

A few winters ago, here in VA, I was driving home around 6:30AM (that period right when there is light, but everything is still somehow dark and it's impossible to see anything) and I saw something in the center of the road ahead of me. I just aimed the vehicle so that whatever it was would go under my center. As I was going overtop of it I realized it was a tiny cardinal.

I stopped the car immediately and jumped out to get him. He was clearly freezing; still breathing but absolutely no movement otherwise. I put him in my bathroom with some bird seed and a box with towels in it. It took about 2 hours before I could hear him darting around and knocking things over.

He died two days later :( I still don't know why. I'm still kind of sad about it."

And she told me that life sucks when you're short and cute; that the only thing that made it safe for her, let alone tolerable, was if nobody felt threatened by her. She said that she needed to be under-estimated, as a personal safety issue.

A few minutes later, I made an excuse to join her. She was smoking, and shaking like a leaf, and she turned to me, and in a voice entirely unlike her normal voice hissed, ""If you tell even one person that I'm smart, I will cut you.""

I was angry enough about being deceived that I stayed out there until she calmed down, and then before I would promise, I made her explain it to me. And she told me that life sucks when you're short and cute; that the only thing that made it safe for her, let alone tolerable, was if nobody felt threatened by her. She said that she needed to be under-estimated, as a personal safety issue.

I agreed to keep her secret. But I still don't know, after all these years, even after all that my consciousness has been raised about women's personal safety issues, how I feel about it.

lalimalina,AskWomen,1389180654.0,"No, that's not me massaging the statistics. In fact I'd go so far as to say that including phone number asks would be massaging the statistics. Perhaps we should include engagements in marriage statistics? Because after all, that's practically a guarantee that marriage will occur shortly.

Clearly I see a huge difference between these people hinting at expressing their interest and the ones who do actually express their interest and furthermore, do something about it. They're adults, they can step up and ask for what they want. If they're just going to waffle about I'm not interested. And yes, of course I'll exchange numbers after I make a date with someone; that's necessary natural progression."

Poptartica,GirlGamers,1389180916.0,"Well, my best friend I'd known for many years went to school for 3d graphic design. She worked at a few game companies (and some other various ones) and ended up there. I graduated college with a degree in molecular biology and wasn't finding a job sadly, so she kept her ear to the ground for any opportunities. 

The company she worked at then needed ""Production Assistants"" (which is essentially QA, Production, game/balance feedback, and full-time inter-departmental assistance combined in one). I applied and when a second PA spot opened that they needed to fill they called me up and offered me the job. My experience was essentially just being an avid gamer for many years,  and being sure to apply to and thoroughly test every beta I could get my hands onto in my spare time. My scientific background in college prepared me for what my usual daily tasks would become: checking both important and minute details of the daily game builds or submitting any bugs into the company database in a manner where the programmers, artists, and designers could easily reproduce and understand the issue. I hope to progress into design at a later time but honestly the design positions are so varied between projects I've come to realize - the designers at my company are learning new toolsets on almost every project it seems..

You know, now that I think about it I do have a few words of encouragement. I am coming to find that a lot of people in this industry don't focus very much on what your education is. They really only care what your education has enabled you to *do*, and if you are able to create and design without that big ticket name education, people are usually pretty receptive to that. If you say you read the job description and feel you are qualified, I wouldn't worry. Even then, they do a surprisingly large amount of learning new tools on the job because where I work, the engine or game code that is used for one project could easily be different in the next project, and often is, and so forth. I was surprised too since in the science world there is a very big fixation on education and name dropping (not that there is anything wrong with education on its own of course!!), but in the game design business people seem extremely results driven. Sometimes I feel like my company would hire the guy sleeping behind the taco bell down the street if he could code like a god, lol. It's just that those things don't *usually* happen ;)"

Perspective133,worldnews,1389181216.0,"&gt; My core argument is that the sum total of these good deeds does not exceed the sum total of the misdeeds done in religion's name

I realize that. And as I had pointed out before, *such an argument is very, very difficult to prove or disprove*. For every example one of us will bring to the table as an argument, there will always be a counter-example. Humanity has been around for quite a while, after all.

&gt;Science brings us technology and understanding at exponentially-increasing speed while religion remains stuck in the superstitious dark ages, fighting a desperate rear-guard battle against cultural extinction in the western world.

I believe I've given some concrete proof to dispel this one just on the contributions of Christians alone, which I had linked to. However, off the top of my head I will also point out that Muslims were the ones who originally conceived the concept of zero in a mathematical sense, and also pioneered algebra as we know it. I'm quite sure I could dig up many, many, many other examples, but as I have stated before, it's really irrelevant since there will always be a counter example.

You know what would be really nice? How about this. I worship my God in whichever way I choose, and you believe whatever you like, and as long as you are a decent person and don't infringe upon me, I won't infringe upon you.

But, ah, it's never that simple, is it? After all, politics is a game best suited for those who tend to be corrupt (Machiavelli has explained that game in great detail), and there's always going to be things which they use to divide us. Christian, Muslim, Jew, Democrat, Republican, Socialist, Libertarian, black, white, male, female, gay, straight, whatever. There's just *so* many ways to pit us against one another, now isn't there?

I'm content with the fact that I've actually engaged in an intelligent conversation over such a heavy issue with you via the internet with neither of us acting like children and calling each other juvenile names.

Now, I have a few hours to eat my 1000 calories (thats what I've been eating most days these last 8 months), and this allows me to make a lot of different dinners. You can make quite an evening meal for 1000 calories, or whatever your calorie goal is.

Like I said, IF isn't a weight loss method per say, but I sometimes find it difficult to eat enough in the evenings - and I don't have to worry about breakfast and lunch. It takes a while to get used to, and it's not for everybody, but I find it preferable to many-meals.

This is a pretty good guide to it. Give it a read: http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2013/08/06/a-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting/"

Also, Both Matthew and Luke are known to source the gospel of mark which in turn is not a direct source.

Unfortunately, due to a lot of backlash against feminism and propaganda by MRAers, redpillers, etc, it's become pretty popular for a lot of young people who hang out on the internet a lot to explicit identify as anti-feminist, as you can see from these responses.  Some of those people are poly, too.

Qieth,loseit,1389185303.0,"The first 10 minutes are a bit rough. After that, it's like I get a surge of energy. Here's why:

I eat my last piece of food around 11 pm or midnight. By the time I wake up, my stomack is empty (safe for the water and coffee I drink throughout the day). The body needs energy somewhere, so it goes to the energy I'm trying to get rid of: Fat.

You might remember how carbs work during workout. If you eat a pre-workout snack, your body burns that first and slowly moves over to burning fat instead of carbs. But in this case, there are no carbs, and your body is already burning fat deposits to keep you awake - it's just a matter of turning up the dial.

I found that my energy levels are more stable during a workout (after the initial 10 minutes until my body catches up). When I ate 5 meals a day, I would usually go hungry halfway through the workout, or my blood sugar would crash and I would *need* a pickmeup. I don't get that anymore.

The biggest change with all of this is getting over the initial hunger - water and coffee helps, and you can ease into it. I've been fasting for a couple of months, and it took me a few days to turn it around. But your body adapts to the feasting schedule (thats the caveman argument for you right there), and my hunger starts turning up a few hours before 6 pm."

YoungFolks,AskReddit,1389185828.0,"Arrests usually matter less than convictions. Most employers only ask if you've ever been convicted, not if you've been arrested. Even then, it depends on whether the charge is an infraction, misdemeanor, or felony. Different states/regions have different laws. Also, most places in the US allow for convictions to be dismissed, meaning it's like you were never convicted in the first place, and employers won't see a charge there. There are specific requirements for dismals that depend on your county, but generally if you finish your sentence, including probation if you get it, you can get the charge dismissed.

I even said I was new so please bear with me and he started saying it's not hard and there isn't anything to lean for tanking. The WHM kept saying to hurry up and would start pulling trash onto me and I didn't have enough mp or tp to keep spammin flash and overpower on the new mobs. I died cos he couldn't keep me alive and then he moaned at me again.

Zaiton,starcraft,1389187243.0,"&gt; ‘Who’ or ‘whom’?
&gt; There’s a continuing debate in English usage about when you should use who and when to use whom. According to the rules of formal grammar, who should be used in the subject position in a sentence, while whom should be used in the object position, and also after a preposition. For example: 
&gt; 
&gt; Who made this decision? [here, who is the subject of the sentence]
&gt; Whom do you think we should support? [here, whom is the object of support]
&gt; To whom do you wish to speak? [here, whom is following the preposition to]
&gt;  
&gt; Some people do still follow these rules but there are many more who never use whom at all. The normal practice in current English is to use who in all contexts, i.e.:
&gt;  
&gt; Who do you think we should support?
&gt; Who do you wish to speak to?
&gt; 

Just copied from Oxford dictionary. I don't think people use them very much as they're an unnecessary difficulty. You will be understood just as well for saying ""Who do you wish to speak to?"" in contrary to ""To whom do you wish to speak?

English is also my second language, by the way.

If it's a no to these questions then perhaps you may not have a problem. People are affected differently and it seems you don't use porn as a way to escape but to relax. 

Remember, I'm not here prove anything to anyone here. All I'm doing is bring insight on NoFap for you. Ultimately it's your own decision. I suggest you look around the subreddit more and analyze other fapstronauts' posts. Then you can make your choice. 

Also, I'm curious on what your age and career is. You said a few years back in your OP you were 20-21. It's quite uncommon for your people under 25 to make six figures.

They searched the minesite all day long. Helicopter + guy standing on a bridge with binoculars + ground units. They gave up when it got dark.

Later that night, it got down to maybe 40F. Now, I know that's not really cold, but down here people really freak out about how ""cold"" it is. The mine runs 24 hours a day. An equipment operator went to get on a little tractor to move some cable around. He turned around to back up and there was a dude just standing there in a T-shirt and shorts, shivering.

Qieth,loseit,1389187893.0,"Bizarre at first, but thats because we are used to the 6-meals-a-day tale. As the guide I linked talks about, we are evolved from a species of animals that did not eat 6 meals per day. 6 per day makes sense in order to keep hunger at bay, but it doesn't really matter if you eat 1 meal of 1000 calories or 10 meals of 100 calories throughout the day.

I usually spread out my meals during my feasting time, simply because a 1000 calorie meal is a lot bigger than what I got used to after I started losing weight. I usually have a plate of food which reaches around 500 calories, then a bowl of oats later in the evening which is about 400 calories, and then some fruit a little before bedtime. Roughly 1000 calories, but sometimes I can't stomack (no pun intended. Maybe a little) the extra meals later on.

Tips:

Drink plenty of water. I mean, a lot. It helps with the hunger, and it keeps you hydrated. If you don't drink enough water, even if you don't feel hungry, you might get motion sickness. I do, on days where I don't drink enough.

Try to get a lot of fiber into your meals. I find that with the extra water I drink, if I don't get enough fiber, I am reminded by it once a day. I think you know what I mean.

Read the page I linked. It's quite informative."

The answer is simply no. If you call one part ""the up"" and the other ""the down"", all you have to do is flip the ball over and now ""the down"" is ""the up"" and vice versa.

from this, the four dimensional ""block structure"" of spacetime exists as a single object, with which we cannot meaningfully separate one section of it from another in terms of ""the past"" or ""the future"".

the reason being is because there is no present, and that's just what special relativity tells us.

obviously, using ""up"", ""down"", ""past"" and ""future"" as *relational* adjectives between any two things works perfectly. That's basically how we use the words. but objectively? it's nonsense.

Also, here is a quote that is commonly ascribed to the Buddha (not sure if he really said it or not): ""Holding on to anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die."" That always hits me like a ton of bricks. I wouldn't be surprised if he really did say that! It's a very zen way to look at it. Actually, that's another thing you could do: study zen. I highly recommend The Way of Zen by Alan Watts. It's fascinating, and very helpful. People often think that zen Buddhism is a religion but that was never Buddha's intent...he was simply a philosopher, a man who wanted to be free of all the mental traps we so easily fall into. Including things like holding grudges. He postulated that there is a part of us that likes to hold on to hurt and anger and being slighted, and it is only when we learn to let go of our ""ego"", for lack of a better word, and stop letting it call the shots that we learn how to really forgive and not let things get to us so much in the first place. I still haven't read the entire book, and already it's been a huge help for me. It's heavy reading and you'll want to read it with a notebook and pen handy so you can write stuff down."

TheBionicAnkle,TalesFromRetail,1389189838.0,"I have a decent Rage Quit story that i witnessed
This was about 2 years ago and I worked at a pharmacy chain(think about a wal thats a certain color) and its hard to explain this place because we were successful despite the fact that all but 3 of the people in charge sucked on every level.

The chain of command broke down to one SM, one ASM,and 4 Shift supervisors. The ASM was an okay guy nice and all and kind of knew what to do but this was his only store. He started as an associate and got promoted to ASM in the same store under the same SM. 2 shift Supervisors had experience from other stores before they got hired at my store so they knew what they were doing. the other 2 Shift Supervisors were the worst. 

First lets start with the fact that they refused to work together and if they ever had shifts that overlapped they would fight and bicker all day. Or they would come tell you to do something only to have the other come and tell you under no circumstance were you to do what the other told you to do. When on their own they would openly complain about how they didn't get paid enough(I was making $8.50 an hour and had to work every weekend while they made $15 an hour and would rotate weekends off)and other random shit. But they seemed like superstars compared to our SM. When I first met him for my interview he Introduced himself as Mr.Asshat(not his real name...I think) which was fine understandable but once I got hired I found out that was how he would introduce himself to everyone Employee customer you name it. He made you call him that no matter what even going as far as altering his name on the schedule to only say Mr.Asshat.

He was also prone to going into these long rambling stories about nothing that would go on for hours. It got so bad we would have to signal each other to save who ever was trapped so they could get back to work. Also he never left his office unless he wanted to find someone to tell a story. Anyway one night me and the ASM are standing behind the counter talking about something because it was a slow night and we had finished everything when a gentleman walks in and asks if Mr.aBROham Lincoln(the asm was a total bro) was working that night. He replies that's him and how can he be of assistance. The guy smiles extends his hand and introduces himself as the manager of some store in another part of the state and that he has been trying to get in touch with him to discuss when he is going to come down to the store so they can make his schedule and he can pick up his keys.

Broham just looks at me then at him and asks him ""What are you talking about I work here"". The gentleman asks him again if he is Mr.aBroham Lincoln, because He was told by Corporate that he had been transferred to his store and that they had notified him months ago that the change was coming. Broham tells him he doesn't know what he is talking about at all and that there must be a mistake. Just then Mr.Asshat walks out of the office as he is leaving for the night so Broham calls him over and they explain the situation when Asshat goes ""OH yea they called to talk to you and I told them I would handle informing you that you where gonna get transferred I must of forgot"". Broham Loses it and starts cursing about how he could Just forget something like that. This is a move that would impact his life because the store he had been transferred to was about 2 hours drive away from our store. The other Manager is just shocked because he called and spoke to Asshat to get Brohams contact info which a month ago which Asshat admits he gave him the wrong info because the call reminded him that he didnt tell him about the transfer.

Broham is now just pacing infront of the register muttering and cursing while the rest of us just stand there. Well me and the other store manager are standing there Asshat just shrugs and tells him that he was a good worker and he will be missed best of luck at the new store but he has to get home and he starts walking to the door. Broham snaps and starts yelling and telling him to go fuck himself and this and that and actually starts walking towards asshat me and the other manager stop him when Asshat asks him why he is bugging out he makes this weird noise like he cut off a scream/cry. He stares at the ceiling for a minute before taking off his name tag and shirt and telling the other manager he is sorry but he cant be his new ASM because he no longer works for this company. He gives me a pound and walks out the door but not before telling Asshat to go fuck himself and to have fun closing tonight(it was just me and broham we were the closing shift on a sunday night we closed at midnight this took place at 7pm)Asshat just stands there staring out the door as me and the other manager just starre at each other.Asshat finally breaks from his daze and tells me to lock the doors and tell any customers that come to the door we are closed to due to a computer issue he is gonna go do the money and we are closing early.He then huffs to the back without another word. The other manager just shakes his head and hands me a card telling me if I want to transfer call him.

tl;dr shitty manager forgets to tell ASM he is being transferred two hours away until days before he is to start,ASM rage quits"

Phaedrus49er,panthers,1389189858.0,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted as this is a legitimate question.

For comparison, look at an early story about adding a retractable roof to [Arthur Ashe Stadium](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/14/usta-retractable-roof-will-be-constructed-over-arthur-ashe-stadium/) in New York.

Some thoughts:

* BofA has no adjacent land on which to expand the infrastructure needed to support a one-piece retractable roof. The only option would be to expand over the railroad tracks [to the northwest](http://goo.gl/maps/yq48p), encroaching on some private property that would need to be purchased. Not impossible, but that's a long way to go, and the grade drops significantly in that direction toward Irwin Creek, so there's a major vertical component there.

* BofA is on clay and bedrock, not swamp, so extra weight isn't an issue, and with the above point out, that leaves a two-piece retractable option. There is some room for extra-stadium infrastructure to accommodate a SW/NE retraction, but it would have to remain in the present footprint of the stadium since any attempt to completely uncover the stadium would require the opened roof to overhang Graham Street and possible John Belk Freeway. That's likely out.

* A two-piece SE/NW retraction faces fewer right-of-way obstacles, but then you're back to the grade declination to the northwest, plus future development plans for the Observer parking lot to the southeast.

* That leaves an intra-footprint, two-piece roof, and the shortest range-of-motion would be SW/NE. A good chunk of the stadium (mostly upper deck) would always be covered due to the structural requirements for such a roof, but then you lose every sightline beyond the stadium, at which point you might as well have a dome.

* Oh yeah, AAS seats 23,200, and they're talking about removing some/all of the upper seating to make the roof work. BofA seats 73,778. Slightly larger project here.

TL;DR A retractable roof isn't impossible, just highly improbable and not cost-effective, especially for a stadium this old. It would likely be cheaper to start from scratch on a new stadium than retrofit the current one."

Problem I ran into (upon research, not practice) is that the VZW iPhone is technically unlocked; however, it supposedly cannot access Tmo's LTE network. Wasn't much point to get a 5 if it was running like a 4 or lower on 3G/HSPA, so she got a Tmo 5 to try, and if she didn't like it, she'd sell it and get a VZW 5 (so far, so good, though). If someone can confirm that a fully unlocked VZW 5 can get on GSM LTE, that'd be a boon for people looking to switch with hardware already in-hand.

YoungFolks,AskReddit,1389190553.0,"&gt;First, I noticed that people's perception of my IQ seemed to drop a full standard deviation. In academic discussions where I used to be the ""fulcrum"", I would suddenly be passed over like a speedbump. In socratic questioning exercises, my answers were taken less seriously. More amazing, people began saying I was ""intimidating"" or ""too aggressive"".

This reminds me of some socratic classes I've had and the huge disparity between male and female commenters. First there's usually 3 times more men, and about half of them will regularly speak up. Maybe one or two of the women will speak, and even then maybe only a couple times I'm an entire semester. I know these women are smart and have interacting things to say, but they don't speak. We'll have great discussions during study groups, but in class? They just sit there and take notes. 

I thought maybe because the overall sample leaned male, more males spoke, and it can be awkward to get a word in between regular commenters. Or maybe the women just didn't feel like talking. I'd look at them during class and wish they were a bit more aggressive in stating their opinions. I'd cheer on the inside anytime one spoke up with a good question or criticism. 

But what you're saying, and what I I've read on this thread, really dishearten me.

MaeBeWeird,GetMotivated,1389190768.0,"Perhaps you missed the whole point of the image that you need support and help, not to just be told to get over it.

Especially the frame about how their medication changes who they are (a very real comment for some with mental illness) and that they are probably better off without it, a seriously harmful bit of advice for some people.

Better ways to deal with it:

- offer to work out with the person. Start easy, like going for a walk.

- offer to go out with the person. Even a shopping trip can help (may want to avoid this for some people)

- never tell them not to take their meds. If you have legitimate concerns ask them to speak to their therapist (or go to the ER if it is severe)

They dont need ""just get over it"" they need *support*

If you dont want to take the time to support them then just shut your mouth so you dont say shit that makes it worse. As if ""just try not being depressed"" hadnt occured to them."

I would also then limit contact with him to group settings only and, while being polite and friendly, always keep it light-hearted and be firm and quick to stop him if he gropes you or things that cross boundaries. 

If he's relying on you as emotional support, this will be hard on him and you might feel cruel or like you abandoned him. But he needs to get over you an respect it when you say you're not interested. Plus, if he's not sure of his gender identity then having an interest in you is probably confusing him more; it would be bad for him if he decided to transition just because he thought it would give him a shot with you."

FeatherDie,relationship_advice,1389191364.0,"It's a pretty normal occurrence for people to fall head over heels early on in a relationship. You have attraction, that person is still working really hard to impress you, and you likely haven't had to endure any hardships. I think 99% of relationships feel near *perfect* in the beginning, that's why people don't usually call it true love. Eventually you guys learn, grow, mess up, start over, botch things again, and that's when the true test of your love comes. The most important thing you can do is not make hurtful mistakes until you can TRUST that person. You have 'I love everything I know about this person **RIGHT NOW** syndrome' which is normal for a lot of people.

You are welcome to feel any feelings that you feel. What you shouldn't do is get pregnant, loan that person a lot of money, change your long term goals, or let them pull you away from friends and family. Once you can really trust that person, which only comes with time, then you can start relying on their input when making important life decisions.

I would say that since you're so young (although really close to my own age) that you should use time and experience as your guide. Definitely try to evaluate your relationships more objectively. Is this relationship meeting my life goals? Am I being hurt by this relationship? Yada yada."

The writing is hit-or-miss in comparison, but this isn't as problematic in the second half of the series' run. Season 3 in particular is pretty solid from start to finish.

Sir_Dude,AskMen,1389192069.0,"Yes. But I didn't necessarily *dump* her. 

So I was dating this girl in high school. She wore hearing aids just like me.

Looks wise, I thought she was kind of hefty, and she didn't talk much. I kept thinking that our time together was really awkward because we didn't say much to each other. 

I got this feeling like ""what will people think if they see me with her?"" and started thinking I could do better than her. I rationalized it by reminding myself that she lived 45 minutes away. 

So I just started blowing her off, ignoring her texts and just hoping she would go away (she went to another HS). 

I *dumped* her because I was a shallow person, I was selfish and a coward. 

Of course, I did not realize this until much later, when I found out she had been really hurt by what happened. 

What I've realized since then:

* She was **not** fat. 

* A 45 minute drive to see her is not a big deal.

* She was just as nervous and awkward as I was. 

* She genuinely liked me. (And is the only person I know for a fact that ever has liked me). 

* I hurt her, a lot. 


I ran into her in college a few years ago, she did not seem to hate me, she met someone else after me and had a good relationship. She's moved on.

More than 7 years have passed since we dated, I have not been in a relationship since. I'm still a virgin.

I regret what happened very much, I hurt her and later realized I hurt myself as well. I would give almost anything to go back and undo it. 

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm over her. I have no illusions about getting back together and even so, she lives in a different state. I just regret that I destroyed what could have been a beautiful relationship. "

You held it together for your mother for a week. It is your turn to grieve. Your mom's partner was part of your life too. Her passing is extremely sad. On top of your feelings of loss for that lady, you also are coping with watching your mother suffer, which is in and of itself horrible.

Plus you still need to maintain your own life. Life doesn't stop because our hearts are broken and our world is turned inside out. 

Allow yourself your tears and your grief. It will pass.

benk4,nfl,1389192520.0,"Coughlin is a tough call.  I don't think 2 Super Bowls is a shoo-in.  Jimmy Johnson, Tom Flores and George Seifert all have 2 Super Bowls without being inducted.  But there are some very legitimate reasons for all of them being left out.  Flores and Jimmy Johnson coached for less than 10 seasons and took advantage of one boon of talent to win multiple championships.  Seifert took over Walsh's team and was a failure in Carolina later on.  All good coaches, but certainly not HOF worthy.  

If you look at their records and careers there is a very similar candidate to Coughlin who is as of yet ineligible for the HOF though.  Mike Shanahan, and he's a clear no for me.  But I think Coughlin has two major things on Shanny: He didn't happen into John Elway for his two titles, and he had some legitimate success with the Jaguars while Shanahan's stint with Washington was pretty weak.  Also you just get the feel from watching them that the Giants success is a product of Coughlin's ability, where watching Shanahan I never really got that feeling.

I'd say he's borderline.  If he retired today (and if I was a voter), I'd have to seriously think about whether to give him my vote.  He has a couple more good seasons with the Giants I'd probably give it to him.  "

You have to take responsibility for your own happiness. The only thing that will change when you get out of high school is your horizons move farther away. You can put distance between yourself and the things that have a negative impact on your life. In high school you are limited. You can't change schools like you can jobs, your exposure to new people and opportunities is limited, and you are still accountable to your parents. But, if your horizons move and you don't, nothing changes but the view. 

After high school you will be able (within reason) to go where you want and do what you want. But, the real trick is *knowing* what you want, not finding it. Finding it is easy once you know what it is."

ClitOrMiss,xxfitness,1389193099.0,"Oh man I seriously have the same problem. I get full really fast and also don't eat when I'm lazy. 

I think it helps if I eat really fast. Like watch TV or something distracting (I know this is the opposite of mindful eating but it works for me) and just keep chewing. Maybe also drink less liquid at meals, though that makes me eat faster (but will fill you up). But I try more to focus on ""I chewed quickly for 30 minutes and then oh look at that! the food is gone!"" than looking down at my plate a lot and stopping to talk and stuff. I will definitely get full if I talk a lot.

[basically the opposite of this.](http://www.wikihow.com/Eat-Slowly)

I make stews. I don't eat meat so I use beans but I find making the food more uniform gets me to eat more. I portion out a huge bowl and eat with a big spoon and fill my mouth with food as much as possible. I throw in veggies and beans maybe quinoa, whatever I think is healthy then use simple seasoning. bonus! crockpot it up and you have food for a few days. Eat more healthy snacks. Basically, take the same recommendations for what you eat from the experienced people here and the other fitness reddits and change your eating habits. that's what's worked for me.

I hear you though. People just say ""eat more"" but I get really full really fast and just don't have too much appetite. It's just not that simple for me and the ""eat more. just do it."" advice can be really frustrating for me.

I hope that answers your question and I didn't misunderstand!"

her best course of action, if possible, is to go to court, tell her side of the story, and if she's got a good driving record it'll probably be reduced to a non-moving violation if she takes a driving class.  it might also be a good idea to see if the cop had a dash cam running and get that submitted as evidence, where if the cop was tailgating like that, it could be thrown out completely.  also, lawyers are greedy as shit and this shouldn't be a cause for concern.

i got a reckless ticket a year and a half ago in emporia and got about 15 fliers over the next 5 days for representation.

kornberg,TwoXChromosomes,1389194210.0,"&gt; It's not odd to have more or less people at the reception vs ceremony

If you can't afford to feed them, you can't afford to invite them to the ceremony. The reception is a gift from the couple/their family to thank their friends and family for taking time out of their day to witness and celebrate their marriage. 

It's like if you asked some friends to come to your house to hear you practice a speech while your SO was making dinner. Then, instead of inviting them all to sit down, you asked only 2 of them to stay and hurried the rest out. A wedding isn't anything more than a large party.

It's absolutely and totally rude to invite people to a ceremony but not a reception. It's not that rude to invite people to only the reception as long as firm bounds are put on the ceremony invites, like immediate family only or something like that.

We must be the bigger person and let those 1% be ""right"" also.  This way, we can say proudly that 100% of the customers are right even though we know 1% are in fact wrong.   

I would give the discount, explain the situation as others point out.  But in the end, you only win by giving in.  Just as my employees found it hard to give it to cheats, when you look at it from this angle, that we are letting them win knowing they are wrong, then it makes it easier.  My employees became much more focused on making sure the customer always gets their way.  This solves so many issues, because they know we stand behind the 100% of the customers are right and must get their way. "

NoIdeaJustOneName,NoFap,1389194514.0,"I disagree with some things there :
- First of all, most doctors now agree that masturbation can be healthy (for prostate for example): in the context of a ""normal"" sexual life, it is a way to discover your body and new ways to pleasure. If 2 partners have different sex drives, it can be a way to balance it.

Like for anything, ""the dose makes the poison"". Here in NoFap, most of us are addicted to masturbation, therefore we need a time without any masturbation to change our habits and ""unplug"" the bad wiring of our brains. But it's because a pathological state. What I understood from NoFap goals (and what I want) is to go back to a healthy sex life, which could include some masturbation and/or porn.

But clearly your balls won't explode/rot/anything like this. Worst case, you'll have spontaneous ejaculations, maybe during wet dreams. But ejaculation is not a ""biological need"", as you don't need it to survive."

If she had totally excluded the people she could not afford to host at a reception by not inviting them at all, that is absolutely and completely fine.

But yeah... sex hormone binding globulin is a glycoprotein that is thought to be promoted by some types of HBC and, essentially, what it does is it bundles all sorts of sex hormones up together and handcuffs them.  Including testosterone- which is thought to be why some women's libidos decrease over time on various forms of HBC.  It is rarely an on/off switch kind of thing and it's not an issue that affects everyone and it can even affect women on the same HBC differently."

ETA: Whoops, forgot my reasoning. Because I am psychotically rigid. If masculine's dude stuff, and feminine's lady stuff, I can only personally boil that down to *being* a dude/lady. I'm not capable of thinking of traits as being men only, or more man-suited. When threads like this come up, it's always ""Has integrity, is competent,"" and *I can't gender those traits.* I'm not quite sure how anyone *can*. 

I mean, most of us in AW agree that invalidation is crappy, and wouldn't dream of invalidating someone's gender/jumping on someone for not being a ""real"" man/woman. And.. then we get threads like this and ""What makes a man a man,"" posts which completely blows the previous sentiment out of the water. As soon as you say ""XYZ traits are manly,"" you're saying dudes without those traits *aren't* or are *less* manly. I'm sure we'd all be deeply unimpressed by the answers to ""What makes a woman a lady?"" in AM and throw a fit about how we can act however we want and still be womanly by virtue of being women. Same thing here. As soon as you start defining masculinity/manhood by things that not all men possess, you start to define some men as not being masculine/men - men who self identify as masculine/men.

Personally, I find any variant of ""You're not a *real* man/woman,"" to be an abhorrent thing to say to someone.

So! Like I said. Masculine - being as, of, or pertaining to men - means exactly that **to me.** "

The US was once a backwards country working desperately to bootstrap its economy (in fact, with a military superpower as a significant rival) - in its early days, the willingness to take steps seen as unacceptable today were what ensured its survival.

You start off with weak IP protection, then build up a robust rule of law.

You start off with sustainability as a clear second place priority to growth, but when you can afford it, you switch to environmental stewardship.

You start off with a utilitarian disregard for minorities' rights, but then you come of age in terms of social conscience and establish firm ethical guidelines for fair treatment of individuals.

America's been there and grown and learned from its history. China's in a similar situation, as a nineteenth century nation dragged kicking and screaming into the twenty first. It'll have to learn similar lessons on its own timetable, but developed nations can help more with a tone of engagement rather than hostility or haranguing.

This is especially sensitive when several contradictory issues arise, such as American reservations about Chinese government subsidies for sustainable energy tech. If handled poorly, it can easily lead to a perception among the Chinese that Americans are first criticizing them for polluting, and then criticizing them for sponsoring green technology - and the feeling that the priority is simply on xenophobic China bashing."

cudtastic,miamidolphins,1389196326.0,"Uhh, isn't that what Philbin apologists are doing? I'm not the one arbitrarily placing all the blame on Sherman and none of it on Philbin. 

I'm being realistic; if there were season long issues on the offensive side of the ball, then Philbin (who is Sherman's boss) could do something about it. If Philbin was on Sherman's side and didn't think there was a problem then he is as bad a coach as Sherman.

Bottom line, either Philbin was (A) too incompetent/timid to confront Sherman about fixing the offense, or (B) too stubborn/stupid to realize there was an issue in the first place and sided with Sherman. Either way Philbin deserves blame. That's not me arbitrarily picking and choosing who gets credit (or blame) for what.

Edit: If you're talking about the bullygate thing, my point was that for some reason people give Philbin credit for something that was a debacle he oversaw in the first place. As OceanJuice said, if the culture of the locker room was fucked up, then that was Philbin's fault. So he gets credit for keeping the locker room together after he allowed the culture to get so messed up? Or on the flip side, if it was all media blown up and bullshit, Philbin had nothing to do with it. The locker room culture was fine, and then shit hit the fan, and the entire organization went ""us against the world."" Philbin had nothing to do with lighting a fire under their asses, he just happened to be along for the ride."

It depends if you are in ""hard mode"" (no orgasms at all). If you choose this, then don't see this ex GF.

Otherwises, there is no problem with ""real sex""-related orgasms. I'd say it would be a good thing : having an orgasm during real sex ""reminds"" your brain why an orgasm is supposed to happen (while fucking, and not looking/thinking about people doing it).

Setting aside Biglaw as an outlier, most firms only hire when they are so damned busy they are teetering right on the edge of malpractice.  This means they must review resumes, conduct interviews and hold meetings when they really have no time for any of this stuff, because they waited too long.  On the plus side, there's a good chance they will hire the first qualified-on-paper candidate who can fog a mirror two out of three tries.

Eliasoz,AskReddit,1389196950.0,"I'm sure some ""people"" are beyond rehabilitation. That's a distinction that has to be made. Particularly for more serious offenders: murderers, child molesters, rapists, etc. 

For lesser crimes I'm sure rehabilitation as opposed to just incarceration would be better for society. To add on to the more serious offenders not deserving rehabilitation, some criminals simply don't deserve to be given another chance to get back into society. Their victims never had a second chance. Why should they? 

Another angle to consider: Do you really think, if the punishment for murder wasn't as severe, for example in the USA, that the murder rate wouldn't climb?

The best solution, IMO, would be to have a rehabilitation focused system, but one that allows especially severe cases to be treated as such. It's important to keep dangerous people away from society."

Also I thought all angles inside a triangle were supposed to add to 180 degrees? 

I tried to solve it first by rounding the number to the nearest one and having no decimal places.

I used the cosine law to find angle P and got 46

8^2 = 11^2 + 9^2 - 2 (11)(9)cos P

I then used the sine law to get angle R

11/sin a = 8/sin 46

I got 81 degrees

81 + 46 + 55 = 182

So close ;_;"

Paladin8,Eve,1389197326.0,"Ok, lets extrapolate the data. The change in magnitude between Astero and Stratios is about the same as between Stratios and Nestor (x4 vs. x5 LP). Accounting for this difference with a 1.25 factor, the Nestor should net somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.3k (linear growth) to 4.1 k (multiplicative growth) ISK/LP or 2.1 to 2.6b ISK. Your figure of 2.3b falls nicely into this range, but not as a lower bound but as an average!

However, this doesn't take demand into consideration. SoE Core probes net about the same per LP as the Astero does, at 4% the LP cost, so we can see that demand plays a pretty big role in pricing. As has been discussed in this thread, the Nestor is a very blingy ship for its role and might not find very many buyers. The jump in ISK/LP for other faction ship BPCs aren't anything like the scenario outlined above. E.g. the Vindicator (BS) nets 2.2k ISK/LP while the Vigilant (Cruiser) pays about 2.5K ISK/LP. The Rattlesnake pays &lt;1k ISK/LP while the Gila pays about 1.5k ISK/LP.

SoE LP have consistently been pretty valuable, but beating the trend in such a big way? I have doubts. If you can sell them for &gt;2b ISK, good on you though!"

Actually tribes who lived in what is now USA were extremely successful and powerful before the Spanish arrived in the in Aztec and Mayan lands, brought plague, which spread by trade with the tribes in the USA. 

Hell because of their massive population drop and their empires just disappearing, it actually allowed the environment to recover quite significantly that 1800s industrial revolution environmental harm wasn't as devastating as it could have been..

White people weren't the only ones with great, mighty and powerful human empires...There was the Egyptians, Mansa Munsa's African Empire that held so much gold it caused the value to drop, varying Chinese kingdoms that weaponized gunpowder first, the Parthian Empire, the Babylonians, the Hittites, the Syrians...

White people were the only lucky ones with enough literate people hermits (pretty much Christian monks while Christianity as a general whole was also the culturally acceptable to be) who loved knowledge to try and preserve all knowledge while the empires fell despite the local (same raced same color) elites or (different race but same color) barbarians attempt to hide or destroy it...

The greatest empire known to man was a multiracial (but still hierachial and slave-labour based and it was still centered around one culture) empire. The Roman Empire...the Italian penisula was filled with different people groups who were able to unite, somehow the majority culture ended up being based around the culture they conquered (Greeks), and they had extreme amount of peace when the entire empire was filled with different people-groups...

And you assume all non-white people go into welfare and commit most the crimes...that's only true for one (or maybe two) of the non-white peoples, the rest don't...Orient and Indian Asians who have properly integrated in Western culture drive much of the scientific advances, commit less crimes than the whites, and typically if they are that fully integrated and educated, have no religion..."

The Chinese education system has for centuries emphasized rote learning and conformity, while discouraging innovation and experimentation. The political environment, far from being some historical oppressive outlier, merely grows from this culture of conformity. To truly compete against open societies, China's education system needs an overhaul... And that will require a sea change in parental expectations and norms for their children's academic goals.

The Western education system, when working at its best, encourages innovation over rote conformity, so the coming generations can build upon past achievements instead of just mimicking them. The Chinese education system is making limited inroads to this end, but it's hampered by a culture of Confucian self-effacement, backed by a political system that discourages change."

You can always tell when the most desperate and sad stories are going to come out when the poster starts this defensive.

OP, you've described a tremendously selfish and immature man who has reduced you to a set of tits for his use as a fetish object. *How can you pretend this does not speak volumes about him?* Saying ""but he's a really nice guy otherwise"" is like saying ""it's a great car except that it doesn't have brakes.""

You have a kid with him, I get it. Sunk costs are here in force. But there is no way, *no way* that this behaviour is going to be tolerable for the rest of your natural life. And I think you know it, which is why you started off so strident: we save the best lies for ourselves, so reiterating your absolute commitment is part of trying to convince yourself, via convincing readers of your thread. If you can make everyone accept that this situation is one you can and will live with, it'd be easier to accept it yourself.

I just don't think it's rational or ...frickin *humane* to condemn yourself to this for life. I suggest that solving this issue (or determining whether it is solvable -- because after all a ""fetish"" means for that him, arousal this way is a definite *requirement* of sex, not a bonus) through intensive counselling should be an absolute prerequisite to your going through with the marriage. Otherwise you have two potential futures: the one where you cheat with the first man who treats you as a whole sexual being with (wonderful, enjoyable) needs and a delicious pussy, or the one where your soul slowly withers into nothing until your boobs get too saggy and he exchanges you for a newer model (or just commits himself fully to porn).

Honestly, you're at a crossroads. I really hope you value yourself enough to give your sex life, and your right to be treated as a full human being in the bedroom, full weight in your decision which way to turn."

If you sleep lightly, you'll have no problem waking up to the sensation of your phone vibrating (if phone as alarm is an option for you).

As far as the melatonin is concerned, I think it's just a matter of personal preference. I personally would prefer to not take anything to help me sleep, so I like to take it at the time when it would naturally be released in my body anyway, which again, is when the sun starts going down. Also, I'm not keen on whether or not taking a hormonal supplement even at such a low dose at a time which doesn't align to when it is released naturally in the body would later influence that natural release time, in the event I forget/stop taking it. With that said, I've taken it right before going to bed before, and I've found it still helps me sleep through the night (so far as I can tell). I just prefer to take it at sundown.

Hopefully my answer was more helpful than rambly. Good luck in all your sleeping endeavors! "

nomnomchikhan,beyondthebump,1389198081.0,"There are multiple things to address here.

First, being in a rut and not feeling sexy:
Its totally normal, even 8 months out. You will never be exactly the same shape you were before you had your child, even if you are back at your prepregnancy weight. Pregnancy and giving birth permanently changes your shape. Its ok. Its a new normal you will come to accept over time.

Does he know how you are feeling? Have you communicated it to him by saying exactly what you mean? Men are not good at ""reading between the lines"" and taking subtle hints. He may not have any idea how you are feeling and may think you are still adjusting to things. 

The porn:
Even if you were having sex as often as you want every single day, multiple times a day, every position there is, etc., he would probably *still* look at porn. Porn has no ties with real life. He is not watching porn because he prefers it to you. He is watching porn because just because. Do not let it make you feel badly and *do not* get mad about it and demand he stop looking at it. All that will do is create tension.

How husband and I got the spark back:
The spark is not like it used to be, mostly because we just don't have the amount of time that we used to. Currently also because I'm pregnant again and getting rather uncomfortable. But anyway, I gained back all of the weight I'd previously lost before I got pregnant with #1. I felt like shit. I felt like a failure. I was the heaviest I'd been in my adult life for a little while. We had sex at 6 weeks pp and probably not again for another month at least. It wasn't because I didn't want to, but because I didn't feel pretty at all. I felt gross and disgusting. I thought that since I was disgusted with myself that he must be disgusted with me too.

I finally just talked about it. I told him exactly how I was feeling, down to the nitty gritty details. He told me I was beautiful, he loved me, and that I had nothing to be self conscious about. No, it didn't magically make me feel better, but it made me realize that it was all me. Not him at all. He still loved me and thought I was great.

I decided to, for lack of a better term, fake it 'till I make it. I pretended to be into things. I pretended I thought I was sexy and put sexy things on again. I also worked on myself in the mean time, getting baby weight off, etc. But I did it for *me,* not for him or for the ""sake of our relationship.""

Eventually I got to a place emotionally where I didn't have to fake it anymore. I was into things again, I had accepted the permanently different things about myself and finally felt better."

If a guy says he has very strong feelings upfront, it's expected that I will return those quickly, which is intimidating when I don't know what kind of feelings I have for him at all yet.

Expressing feelings verbally isn't bad if you aren't overwhelming about it.

SentientBagOfWater,AskMen,1389198937.0,"The drink-buying think is a minefield.  I just steer clear of it, for basically the reasons described.  I will buy drinks for friends who I think are going to stand their turn for the next round - I don't care about the exact same dollar amount being spent, just that it's give and take.  It's possible that we'll be friends enough for that to happen on the night we meet in a bar, it's certainly happened before, but it's by no means guaranteed.

There have been plenty of occasions where women I've spoken with have basically closed the toll-gate when it's clear I'm not paying said toll in a beverage based currency, a step beyond what your friend describes.  It's honestly pretty funny to watch.  Only once have I had a lady give me a good dressing down for it, explaining that it was my *job* to buy her a drink if I wanted to talk to her.  That was fun too.

The point of that long-winded context is to justify what I think is the right approach to this type of situation, which is to politely decline the drink (""No, I'm fine for the moment thanks"").  If you're happy enough to talk to this person for a while then do so anyway.  You've not set up an expectation, and you're free to use your social graces at a more comfortable pace to indicate that you're not out looking to meet someone if he starts overtly hitting on you.  Even if he pulls the plug as soon as your boyfriend does come up you've still hopefully been able to have a nice interaction.

If you're not in the mood for talking to strangers, or he otherwise doesn't seem like someone you'd like to talk to, then thank him for the offer but tell him you're just talking to your friends at the moment.  Telling him all about your boyfriend is less important than just declining politely.  He may or may not be a jerk about it, but at least you've done your part by not jerking him around.

tl;dr you probably never have to tell him, at least not right away, there are more graceful ways to negotiate these encounters"

kornberg,TwoXChromosomes,1389199012.0,"Dude, I know. I've been you so many times with siblings, parents and close friends--I can't even count. I've made pretty much every single possible mistake you could make while trying to be there/help people like this. Years of my life were spent in the midst of the drama, the angst and the frustration of WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

At the end of the day, there is one thing you must do and two things you can do that have the best chance of helping someone in your sister's situation. 

The thing you must do is let go. You cannot control her actions, you cannot control what she does and you can't make her want to fix her life. Only she can decide that enough is enough. She may grow out of this in a few years or she may never change. Accept that you can give her advice until you're blue in the face and she will never take it, even if she asks for the advice in the first place. You can't fix her. No one can fix her except for her and she has to want it badly enough to work for it. 

The 2 things that you can do that could possibly help her would be:

1) Be emotionally supportive, even if you're not. Don't talk badly about her, her choices, what she's doing or Lucifer (lol). Even with your family, when she's not around, be supportive. It's her life, her choices and if you want to maintain a relationship with her, respect that she's an adult and respect her choices, even if you may not necessarily like them. Showing her that sort of love and respect will really mean a lot to her. She's probably pretty low on self worth and self esteem and having someone close to her show her the respect and love you show her will really resonate. Stand up to your family on her behalf. You're not defending her choices, you're defending her right to make them and you're defending *her*. Don't encourage any more enabling but don't let anyone say or imply that she's not an intelligent and worthwhile person.

2) Don't give her advice, even if she asks for it. If you're being as supportive as you can, she's going to start coming to you when she's in trouble. Instead of telling her what to do or giving her advice, ask her questions and make her come to the right solution. ""He left me on Christmas to go see his wife what should I do?"" should be followed with something like ""Well, if it were me, what would you think I should do?"" Other questions could be things like ""What would be the end result of that action?"" ""Is that the goal you want to accomplish?"" ""How would you make that happen?"" These are all single questions in the format of a conversation--you're not trying to give her the 3rd degree, you're helping her figure out her own shit. She needs to figure this out on her own. 

I have been in therapy for years (it's amazing, everyone should do it) and that's one thing that I really love about it. I'm not going to listen to someone tell me ""You should dump his lying ass"" because it's not *my* solution. I can rationalize it away and in the moment, I'm just not committed to it. ""I am dumping you because so and so said so"" just isn't something I can get behind. But if I'm asked questions that make me think--I'll probably come to that solution on my own and it'll be *mine*. Let her come up with her own solutions.  

With all of that stuff said and done, it still may not help her. I'd also probably mentally prepare yourself to separate from her if you need to in the future. You can't sacrifice your life and mental health on trying to help someone who won't be helped. There's a point where you say ""I can't deal with watching you do this any more""--you would do well to be ready for it to come. 

Edited to point out the irony of me giving advice on why advice giving is not a productive action. "

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389199149.0,"I think you're over sympathizing with your husband a little bit.  Most HL people here in DBs spend years having ""the talk"" and begging for their LL spouses to get their hormones checked, etc.  He told you he wanted more sex once, and that's it?  Then cheated?  

I think he's using the affairs and your former LL as excuses to justify the fact that part of him just wants to explore what's out there.  I'm sure he loves you (he's obviously still working on the marriage to some degree) but I bet given that you guys got together when you were incredibly young that he probably feels he never got to experience what was out there in terms of other women.   Wondering what he was missing all those years.

If you want to be with him, you need to give him space to figure that out to some degree.  In some ways, a trial separation where you don't see each other might give you both a clearer picture of what you want than continuing to date and have sex, which will add a chemical bonding element that will make it hard for him to choose what he wants.

Another option is to consider an open relationship or polyamory.  BUT that can create more problems than it can solve, but a lot of happy poly people end up in that situation often because they married young and want to experience more.  It sounds like you handled his affairs with a lot of grace, so maybe you're not as sexually possessive as most people.  And maybe you want to experience other people too?  It's something to consider and research, any way."

And I think we'll do it but only after our way of life on this planet is unrecognizable to those of us living now, and only after many people have died painfully; it's the price we will have to pay."

You can find things you both enjoy talking about and doing together. If she knows you love stimulating conversation and you know she loves going on adventures with you, you can find ways to meet each other's needs.

But if you married her only because she threatened to leave and you were afraid you'd never find anyone else, NOT because you loved her, I would say fear is the wrong reason to stay in a relationship.

Since mental illness is also a factor in this, how would you and your wife feel about going to counseling together? That might help you find some clarity.

I don't think he's a villain, I just think you may be fundamentally sexually incompatible. That doesn't make him evil and no one is coming after him with pitchforks, but it's also not a small or unworthy issue. Sex is like air -- if you've got plenty of it and it's good, you don't even notice it, but if it's polluted or being cut off, *it is all that matters*.

On top of your desire to not to reduce your fiance to a villain, I also think you may have some fear-based thinking: basically, ""I'd be a single mother, and I can't do better."" That's one of those toxic assumptions that, when you base decisions on it, spirals into further and further entrenchment because the initial basis that drove your decisions was flawed.

I don't know if it is a male/female thing, or just the unique combination of your two personalities, but there is a distinct people-pleaser pattern here. If your fiance treated you with a fraction of the consideration with which you treat him there would be nothing to post about. You're worried about his stress: what about yours? You're worried about his arousal: what about yours? You're worried about his needs: what about yours? You're (perhaps) worried about whether you can do better: why isn't *he* counting his lucky stars that he has someone in his life that has entertained his fetish at all, let alone to this extent? Why doesn't that motivate him to reciprocate? Etc.

It's important. *You're* important. Self-sacrifice is a short-term solution. If you ignore this or dismiss it, you'd be cheating not only yourself, but him, because you're living a lie for his benefit and it just can't last.

For what it's worth, I don't consider counselling a wastebasket suggestion to be thrown at everyone. I count my excellent marriage counselling experiences as a large contributor to my day-to-day and overall happiness. I really hope you have some breakthroughs if you pursue this.

&gt;I'm afraid he'll get angry that I've resorted to reddit for advice on our relationship.

Anger isn't inherently bad, it's just a feeling. If I were you I'd be experiencing a LOT of it, so I don't judge it. Don't let his desire to maintain the status quo be a cage that prevents you from moving or stretching. Remember -- *he is perfectly satisfied*. Everything you're asking for, he's likely going to resist (which also says a lot about him). But just being mad about it should not be enough to stop you."

OswegoWriter,WritingPrompts,1389200159.0,"http://oswegowriter.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-devils-in-ye-walter-white-006.html

Walter found himself in the Rose &amp; Thistle Saloon in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In the distance he faintly heard the blast of a horn as the factory belched black smoke into the air. He had come here to hide from the New Mexico Territorial authorities who had discovered his terrible secret. He paused, then took a seat at the dusty bar. Running a finger through his handlebar mustache, he summoned the barkeep.

""Sarsparilla,"" he croaked, barely suppressing a cough. The Consumption was catching up to him now. No more bottles of Dr. McCrory's Home-Brew'd Elixir of Health &amp; Vitality remained to keep him alive. He would die soon, far, far away from his family in the territories. This was especially ironic, given that he himself was the fabled ""Dr. McCrory"" now wanted by the federal marshals.

He took out the last piece of paper, a fountain pen, a vial of ink, and began writing his confession.

He started with the story of how it was he, not Thomas Edison, who had crafted the lightbulb. It was he who had suggested Tungsten as a filament. It was he who said a vacuum must exist inside the bulb. Everything about the light bulb was Walter's idea except the shape itself; but in the end, that was enough for Edison to take credit. The shape's the thing, Edison had retorted just before firing Walter.

Walter went on to describe his situation: a half-breed Indian wife, a son lamed by Rickets growing up in the Lower East Side, a newborn daughter who would never remember him now. How the family had sold everything to live on the Ute Reservation to the northwest of a dinky town named Albuquerque. How he taught sciences on the reservation and repaired wagons for travellers just to be able to feed his family. 

And then he came to Jessie. A former student who'd narrowly avoided arrest for selling snake oil. It was the opportunity Walter needed. He purified the formula: a combination of olive oil, exotic herbs from Italy, but mostly bathtub gin. It was one of a million false cures for every condition under the sun, but Walter made it work. He'd discovered a mould in one sample, but rather than dispose of it, he tested the mould to identify it. And what he'd found astonished him: the mould produced a chemical that killed bacteria. Walter and Jesse had stumbled upon an actual cure to thousands of diseases from Syphillis to infection. 

Production had begun slowly, but soon they'd found themselves in the employ of a dry goods proprietor from South America who secretly controlled much of the snake oil cartel in the Territories. Gustav had given them everything they needed, but Walter couldn't stand for working for another man; he wanted to be the best, and to be the best, he had to eliminate everyone and everything standing in his way. 

First was the vaqueros, all poisoned by Gustav, then Gustav himself, killed by dynamite. Another brilliant chemist, Gale, had to be eliminated as well; Walter had manipulated Jessie into shooting him in a gunfight. Then it was the local Klansmen: they had helped Walter tie up some loose ends, but they'd also killed Walter's brother-in-law, a federal marshal named Henry. Walter dreamed of exacting revenge on them, but now he was stuck here in New Hampshire....

Walter paused. He'd been writing for three hours, and his hand was beginning to cramp. But his confession was complete. He folded the sheet in thirds, then walked back to the bar.

""Another sarsparilla, stranger?"" the barkeep asked.
""Please. And could you see that the local police captain receives this letter? Tell him it's from Walter White."" The barkeep froze. Everyone knew of the outlaw Walter White, and now here he was. Walter smiled. ""I'll wait,"" he said coolly. The barkeep turned and left the shop, probably in hot pursuit of the nearest patrolman. It would be a while, still, so Walter picked up a newspaper from behind the bar and began to read.

What he saw on the front page chilled him to the bone, then filled him with rage: EDISON PLEDGES $400,000 TO FUND ANTI-SNAKE OIL TREATMENTS. Walter couldn't see beyond the headline, his mind was clouded with rage. Then he had an idea. A wonderful, terrible idea...."

Anyway, let's just say that *I have a very hard time imagining Transnistria as a part of Moldova*, but I really don't know. The available survey from 2011 (and I don't know anything about its reliability) says that 7% of people (from Transnistria) want Transnistria to be part of Moldova. About 40% want it independent, and about 40% want is to be part of Russia. (more than 80% would vote for its independence)

What can we do when only 7% of the people there want to be part of Moldova? Our PM plans to make Moldova attractive by associating it with the EU and eventually developing it into a nicer place, and thus ""luring"" transnistrians back to their roots. But realistically, how many decades will pass before Moldova becomes even mildly attractive? Russians are not gonna sit idly by either. They spend a lot of money on PR there.

I'd really love our country to get rid of Transnistria, especially if they are so stupid as to want it themselves, but I don't want Russia at my country's border either. 

Still, I'd vote for the acceptance of its independece if we had *some* guarantee of safety/stability, like re-uniting with Romania or becoming a EU member. Neither of those are going to happen anytime soon, so I'm not seeing a solution to the conflict currently, other than giving it up anyway. But then, the Gagauz people will want to secede too, and Moldova will turn into this clusterfuck of territory and I'm sure as hell these 2 new-born &lt;Republics&gt; would work their asses off to impede our progress. 

On the other hand, what would they be able to do? The only reason they're making trouble is because they're *not* independent, and as long as the conflict exists, Russia can use it to destabilize our country. That's why Russia is not interested in solving the Transnistrian conflict. I don't feel great about losing territory but that would only help.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389200679.0,"Libido can wax and wane, particularly for women I think, but it sounds like she's a typically LL person who, during what polyamorous people call ""NRE"" - new relationship energy - her libido gets kicked into overdrive due to all the crazy chemicals rattling around in her brain at the time.  Once that goes away, she returns to her baseline.

The herpes thing is really tough.  No advice for you, just sympathy.

Give her a chance to see if she's serious about trying to jumpstart her LL.  Consider a ""sex challenge"" of agreeing to have sex as enthusiastically as you both can every day for a set period of time.  Have those date nights.  She should be reading erotica or watching porn or at least masturbating and making an effort to get herself into a sexy frame of mind.  Exercising should help too.

If she does all this with a good attitude and really tries and it doesn't increase her libido, that might just be her natural state.

And if she doesn't really try at all?  Well, you have to make a choice, then."

ImmaRussian,standupshots,1389200865.0,"Regardless of whether this is real, it's very true.

It might seem shallow, but it's absolutely true. I dated someone once who was really nice and sweet and calm 99% of the time, but she always said when she got mad she was unpleasant to be around.

It took a lot to get her mad though, so I never really * really * saw her mad for the first time until... My computer-use habits started to have an impact on her and she spent increasingly more time computing. She does not deal with technical issues well. She gets angry, frustrated, irrational, anxious, nervous, won't accept help, and usually ends up just sitting there shaking with rage and repeatedly clicking something that obviously doesn't work.

To be perfectly honest, although in the large scheme it wasn't a big deal, that was actually one of the things I considered when I decided to break up with her. That's not normal and it seemed like an indicator of larger issues. We've all wanted to throw our computers out the window at times, but we don't; we settle down, google the problem, maybe write &lt;product&gt;'s customer service a strongly worded passive aggressive message, immediately regret doing so, and if we really can't work it out, we DO SOMETHING ELSE.

EDIT: When I say ""Computer problems"", I don't mean 'The internet is out' or 'I have a bluescreen', I mean like ""I don't know where I saved that file."" or ""I forgot my password.""

But when you're out of high school, you get to shed the last 18 years of your life and the reputation you unfairly grew up with. So long to the time in second grade you farted while doing situps.  You don't have to see the same people who knew you as an awkward kid with braces. They don't see you as the gangly acne ridden kid. New people will meet you as you want them to, in a post-pubescent stage.

Then take the experiences. Until now, you're living in a super small ecosystem which you cannot escape. Suddenly, you're able to make giant life-changing decisions. Do you go to college? Get a job? Hitchhike across the country? The freedom of choice is exhilarating. 

I finished high school as a shy wallflower who only spoke during class, had no friends and was borderline suicidal. I'll be honest, the first year of college was rough. However by the time I graduated college, I was a self confident person with a close knit group of friends and probably more outspoken that I should have been.

Like with all other nations, [international recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine). Given that [the majority of the world - in terms of population *and* number of nations - recognizes Palestine as an independent state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Palestine_recognition_only.svg), I'd have to say it's considered independent whether you or I like it or not. Figuratively and culturally, the definition of ""Palestinian land"" has varied over the of history and depending on the source, but under international conventions, ""Palestinian land"" would be land within the state of Palestine, just like Belgian land is generally the land within the state of Belgium.

&gt; my family was here before the British carved the area and created transJordan agreed with France to cut eras from the places we used to call as home

That happened as the Ottoman Empire was [carved up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitioning_of_the_Ottoman_Empire) after their loss in WWI. Along with the British and French mandates (Lebanon, Mesopotamia, and Palestine) in that area, the rest of this Asian, African and European empire was chopped up and redistributed in a similar manner. Your family is Palestinian, no doubt (whether Jewish Palestinian or Arab Palestinian or Christian Palestinian or whatever else), but you are definitely not special in regards to having your land rearranged by foreign powers. If we look at each of those cases from this position, many national claims on these three continents may or may not be legitimate."

I use erase paste and happen to like it, but there was a little truth to her statement ""you can only do so much with makeup,"" in that maybe you should look into a skincare regime geared towards treating your under eye area. There are tons of products at Sephora that are made by Philosophy, Shiseido, PTR, Ole Henriksen, etc., that are specifically for treating circles, puffiness, dryness....there's tons. 

Maybe go to a different Sephora and explain you're looking for a skincare routine for your under eyes. I don't have many problems with that area of my face personally, other than some puffiness and darkness, but I suffer from acne and dry skin so there really was only so much I could do with makeup, but it still looked weird. I got one of the clarisonic Mia 2 things and I love it. My skin feels and looks so much better, so my makeup does too.

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389201229.0,"Despite any reasoning on my part, when my boyfriend hopped out of the car (after a little grumbling) to scrape all the ice off my windshield, I thought to myself, ""He is so manly."" It just struck me as such a masculine thing to do, on a kind of instinctive level. I think the same thing when he fixes or builds stuff, or when he leans over and I can see how defined his shoulders are, or when he opens jars or carries heavy bags for me. I suppose when his strength is on display, but particularly in a way that's serving others, I find him particularly masculine. None of that is something I actively looked for in a man, but I do appreciate it.

It's social conditioning, of course. I get that. And it's not something I do consciously. When I *think* about masculinity, I know that a good amount of it is ridiculous, and I usually don't apply the label to anything in order to avoid negative associations. But that's still what pops into my head.

So I suppose my internal concept of masculinity is tied to male bodies and is almost always positive (ie, it's masculine to use one's upper body strength to help other people). I don't usually connect personality traits to gender constructs, even on that unconscious level.

EDIT: I also think that on some level, when men do things that my dad typically did for me or my family, I probably see those things as masculine just because that's how adult manhood was modeled for me growing up."

The second game, specifically in terms of characterization, blows ME1 away. There are so many colorful, well-rounded characters with complex issues everywhere.

It was destroyed because it was too big and too centralized, politically at Rome, and economically in the eastern half. When it split to be easier managed, the west fell because it wasn't as economically or agriculturally  productive enough to support then enitre western population...when most the money comes from Greece and Asia Minor (Turkey today) and the food comes from Egypt..and it stopped going west, they were screwed. 

The West fell under it's own weight. 

On European welfare, that because it's to easily gives away welfare. There's an arguement to be made whether or not welfare should be done by the state at all, and if so, it should be to the benefit of the state. If immigrants aren't economically moving up because welfare has made them lazy, then only offer welfare to naturalized citizens. Most immigrants ought to want to move up economically, not stagnate and rely on the state. America's immigrants did, the stagnating ones are the blacks whose ancestors were kidnapped and brought here, and possibly the Hispanics, but we'll see if the Hispanic one sticks...especially if US and Mexico both legalize and decriminalize drugs, the cartel's power go down, Mexico economic chances should be boosted and they will probably be a mass migration back.

Firstly there's  the Welsh accents: Edwards accent is a South Welsh accent (Swansea, Cardiff etc.)  a couple of people seem to think He's speaking in an English or Irish accent. He's not It's just different to the stereotypical Gavin and Stacey accent and seeing as I have the same accent I'm pretty sure it's  Welsh. Bartholomew  Roberts accent as he says in the game is from West Wales (Pembroke, Tenby etc) 

Next is the Worsil and estuary accents this is the accent that Blackbeard, James Kidd and Ben Hornigold are speaking Blackbeard and James Kidd being more Worsil which is the accent found in Cornwall and Devon. Hornigold speakes in an estuary  accent which is a more common accent and is used across the south and as the name suggests along the  Rivers Severn and Thames 

Charles Vane I can't really tell it sounds Northen but the accent is so damn gravely I can't really pin it to any where but the game says Norfolk so thats a good a place as any 

Calcio Jack and Stede Bonnet actually speak well Im not sure if its athing but Anglo-Carribean. What with jack being half Cuban and Bonnet  being Barbadian (although his does sound more like an estuary accent )

Woodes Rogers speaks the Queens English found in london and the home counties

There are more in the game but the most common are the Estuary  Worsil and Welsh accents most likely to reflect most  pirates during the era came from the South West and Wales"

Accessories are often available for cheap, and can be found in places like H&amp;M or Forever 21 that cater to young broke people.

For your staples, look for stuff that everybody needs in classic cuts and styles (jeans, slacks, pencil skirts, little black dress, that kind of thing). Most of them should be in neutral colors, but if you want a bright color go for one that's always in style, like classic red.

ballookey,exjw,1389201994.0,"You know that 1914 is significant in JW teachings? Even if you don't understand why, you know they hinge a lot on it. 

1914 is the basis for asserting that Jesus inspected and appointed the Faithful and Discrete Slave in the years that followed. 

If this date is wrong, then Jesus didn't appoint the Jehovah's Witnesses organization, therefore they have no claim to be the ""faithful and discrete slave"".

Well, they arrive at the date 1914 because they insist that Jerusalem fell in 607 BC. They count forward from 607 BC using their cockamamie numerology (day for a year, seven times = 2520 years). This is why the year 607 is probably familiar to you.

EXCEPT that *every* [historical source agrees](http://tinyurl.com/kuhbwkz) that Jerusalem *didn't* fall in 607. 

The JW's leadership made mistakes, or wanted 1914 to be significant early on. When it was pointed out to them that Jerusalem actually was laid siege in **587**, they decided that to change all the dates would be too great a stumbling block, so instead of fixing their assumptions, they covered up the truth. They established an extremely shaky justification for continuing to use 607. (this is covered in Raymond Franz's *Crisis of Conscience* — he was instrumental in writing the Society publication *Aid to Bible Understanding*, and it was during the research of this publication that Society writing committee discovered 607 was wrong).

Additionally, [they rely on certain historical sources](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/607-587.php) for the ages and dates of reign for certain people to build the JW timeline to arrive at 607. However, *those sources*, when studied arrive at 587. When confronted with this, the Society claims that such sources are unreliable. Well, if they're unreliable, then how do they justify citing those sources where it's useful to the Society's chronology? 

Either the sources are reliable or they're not. 

And that doesn't even get into the issue of whether or not the Daniel prophecy they rely on was ever meant to have two fulfillments (none of the rest of them did, so why this one?), and the fact that the early Bible Students didn't come up with this whole idea themselves, via divine inspiration: they got it from Seventh Day Adventist teachings of the time."

imnotminkus,OSU,1389202326.0,"[Here](http://sppo.osu.edu/undergraduate/spanish/departmental-exams/multicat) is the page for placement test info, and [here](http://sppo.osu.edu/undergraduate/spanish/departmental-exams/em) is the page for EM (credit by examination) info.

There are also some details about the placement/EM tests [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/201203116563840/?view=permalink&amp;id=274561539227997).  For the placement test, it was mostly like ""here's a sentence, which word goes here"", and I think it was both for vocab and verb conjugation.  There was also probably some reading comprehension.  It's all given on a computer.

For sample resources, I'd look/ask around for syllabi from Spanish 1101-1104.  I have one for the quarter version of 103 somewhere, but that's it.  If you email/call the department they might be able to help you.  From there, you can be sure you've covered everything, and use any generic spanish book/the internet to help with the rest.

I took 4 years of Spanish in high school, took the Multicat placement test at orientation and tested out of 101 and 102, I took 103 3.5 years later at OSU (and still remembered basically everything, though a refresher was nice) which was pretty much a review and I easily passed, then took the EM test and tested out of 104 with a 92/100 (you need 80% or higher to pass).  So, you should definitely be able to test out of at least the first one with a refresher, and maybe even the second.  If you use the syllabi and be sure everything (especially verb forms, especially irregular verb forms) are covered, you might be able to do all three.  It depends on how much time you want to invest reviewing before the placement test, and after that, if you want to do a bit more and try for the EM test for each class.

OSU Spanish classes are pretty easy, especially since you've had Spanish classes before, but they do involve a decent amount of work.  It's not difficult work, but there's a fair bit of tedious busywork."

Tokyocheesesteak,worldnews,1389202344.0,"&gt; As far as I know not a single state in the world does that, I belive you mix international actions to provide an non observer state (which is a diffrent thing).

[Countries that have recognized the State of Palestine.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Palestine_recognition_only.svg) As you can see, the majority of the world recognizes its statehood.

If you prefer general UN recognition over individual national recognition, it's [still recognized as a state](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/20/u-n-adds-new-name-state-of-palestine.html).

&gt; Interesting there are no ""borders"" defined for the recognition, for example in the sign in Bethlehem include the entrie area east of the Jordan river.

A rock with a picture chiseled on it in no way indicates the status or recognition of whatever the artwork shows.

&gt; And yet this happens right now , you are just claimed in the above comment that there are ""illegal settlers on Palestinian land."".

Mello2912,zelda,1389202444.0,"From the Zeldapedia:

&gt; Origins:
A side-story in the Majora's Mask manga reveals the supposed origin of Majora. Majora was originally a giant dragon-like creature who guarded an empty, timeless land -- a land neither living nor dead. The armor this dragon wore was highly sought after, as it was fabled to be capable of granting wishes and bestowing great power unto its owner. Many humans came to the land hoping to claim the armor for their own purposes, both good and evil, but Majora devoured them, men and women alike. **One day, an unnamed traveler (who is akin in appearance to a rather weathered-looking adult Link, left-handed and all)** comes to converse with Majora, rather than to claim his armor. In their dialog, this stranger sympathizes with Majora, pointing out his loneliness. Majora considers the traveler's analysis and using the desires of the devoured, develops a wish of his own; for time to pass, that he may rest at last and end his loneliness. The Link-like character takes a drum from his bag and begins to play, telling Majora to dance. Majora dances furiously for three days and nights, and as he dances, time is born. On the fourth day, the dragon dies (as do all creatures for whom time passes) leaving behind only his armor, and the neither-dead-nor-living land is destroyed. The man then carves a mask from the creature's magic armor into what came to be known as Majora's Mask, hoping to seal its power forever.

So the hero of time *did* encounter Majora is his origin form. Now I'm wishing for that prequel too..."

&gt;Participants were led on a guided tour of an art museum and were directed to observe some objects and to photograph others. Results showed a photo-taking-impairment effect: If participants took a photo of each object as a whole, they remembered fewer objects and remembered fewer details about the objects and the objects’ locations in the museum than if they instead only observed the objects and did not photograph them.

&gt;However, when participants zoomed in to photograph a specific part of the object, their subsequent recognition and detail memory was not impaired, and, in fact, memory for features that were not zoomed in on was just as strong as memory for features that were zoomed in on. This finding highlights key differences between people’s memory and the camera’s “memory” and suggests that the additional attentional and cognitive processes engaged by this focused activity can eliminate the photo-taking-impairment effect.

So there. Also, I've had some interesting and memorable adventures due to photo-taking. I may or may not have broken into a church in the middle of the night (got a great photo) and gone on difficult hikes to get that perfect shot."

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389203304.0,"IANAL, this is general advice and you should verify with the appropriate authority in your state.

As others have said you've got to review the details of your lease.  The occupancy limit needs to either be in the agreement or be a established through law somehow.  If it isn't mentioned in your lease, ask your landlord to point you at the limit.  

However, being *pregnant* does not violate the occupation limit, only giving birth will.  So you have until you give birth to resolve the issue and your landlord cannot take any action against you until that time.  But that literally means the day you give birth, not your due date.  If you pop early you are in violation and the landlord can take action against you as laid out in your lease.

So you should probably give notice for the end of February and either find a new 1 bedroom that will allow 3 occupants or a 2 bedroom.  Sucks, but such is life.  I have no idea if it is available but low income housing projects typically have higher occupancy limits from my experience.  Good luck!"

Ingredients:  
2 eggs, beaten  
1 cup almond flour  
1/3 cup Splenda  
1 1/2 tsp baking powder  
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
1/2 cup raspberries  
  
Preheat oven to 375. Combine all ingredients except raspberries in a large bowl and mix well. I went ahead and cut the raspberries into smaller pieces. After eating one, this was a good move. Gently fold in the raspberries. Use a spoon to drop batter onto a parchment lined baking sheet. I would say I used 2-3 tbsp of batter per scone and that yielded 9 scones. Bake for 15 minutes until lightly browned. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving warm.

I think it's funny that modern Democrats demonize him so much while the GOP tries to trumpet that he wasn't as bad as he seemed, because he actually had some pretty liberal policies.  I'd say he's closer to a modern Democrat than to a modern Republican.   

He created the EPA, eliminated the gold standard, did a good job overseeing the integration of schools, put some wage and price freezes in place, supported affirmative action, and pushed for some healthcare reform with employer mandates and Medicaid expansion.  It was mostly just his foreign policy that would fall in line with modern Republicans.  

Watergate was about as major a gaffe as it's possible for a President to pull, but it's easy to understand how he got that way.  He'd had several incidents (like the Checker's incident, possible voting fraud that cost him an election, and the fact that he was mistrusted by a lot of the public because he was ugly and looked like a werewolf) that made him a wary and untrusting man who thought his political opponents were out to get him, and he was probably right about the last part.

Much like what I said about black women in white media, what I meant by my statement is that women like... Lucy Liu would not do all that well in asian beauty standard/media whereas in the western world they fit what white people want/consider beautiful (for asian women).  There is a specific feature set/look that is attractive to the west as an ""asian"" and this excludes a lot of looks that would otherwise be attractive in asia.        

edit: and this:           
&gt;Maybe I'm misreading you here but the majority race in America is still white so whatever white people tend to like (unless its a slight preference strongly counteracted by other races) will often be by definition what the average guy finds most attractive

Hmmm... If the goal was to simply use my schoolwork as an element of play, that could be fun in its own right - but if the goal is to leverage the dynamic to actually improve my academic performance, I don't think that mixing play directly with studying would accomplish that. It'd be too distracting and not all that productive.

But I'm currently possibly exploring this idea with a partner in a very simple way: if I don't go to class and study on an appropriate schedule, I don't get to play. That's the entire extent of it.

If I failed, I wouldn't even be punished in the context of a scene - which, even if truly unpleasant (not just ""funishment""), I'd find rewarding in terms of catharsis - I'd just be forced to waste our time together sitting at my desk doing what I should already have taken care of, while he sat in the same room basically ignoring me.

A friend of mine who recently moved to Seattle for a new job.  The friend was invited by coworkers to attend the MNF game vs the Saints.  Not being a huge sports fan, but wanting to make a good impression with the coworkers my friend accepted the ticket and decided to go have a good time.

Fast forward to the 3rd quarter when the game was out of hand, my friend was returning from the concession stands when out of nowhere my friend hears ""Fuck the Seahawks!"" and is sucker punched in face by a near by Saints fan.  Stunned, shocked and not wanting to make a scene in front of the new coworkers, my friend just asks that everyone calms down and is ushered back to their seats.

Now for the twist! My friend is a woman. A 32 year old woman who, apparently, deserved to be punched in the goddamn face.

Needless to say, that behavior is appalling and the story has forever tainted my opinion of the Saints and their fans.

TL:DR - Saints fan punched a woman at the MNF game."

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389204794.0,"This is a rather large question mark in this area.  Based on linguistic evidence (mostly place-names), they don't seem to have been a Semitic people, certainly not a Canaanite group.  Because artifacts recovered from digs resemble those of Greek groups (but not Canaanites), they seem to have been at least from the Aegean, if not Greek themselves.  See [here](http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/pubs/nn/spr95_ash.html).

The main issue with identifying them is that they integrated into Canaanite society over time, adopting the Canaanite pantheon and eventually a Canaanite language.  The lack of much documentation of their language beyond a relatively small number of names is particularly troublesome--a solid relationship with other languages would aid in the determination of where they came from."

breathcomposed,Paleo,1389204893.0,"&gt; In the last few years, it’s also become clear that Celiac Disease is only one of many expressions of gluten intolerance. A general “sensitivity” to gluten which many people experience is now recognized as Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS.) [...]  Just like Celiac Disease, [NCGS] can affect virtually any tissue in the body from the brain to the liver, and has been associated with causing an astounding amount of symptoms and diseases, the most common being IBS-like symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation), brain fog, headaches, migraines, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), depression, anxiety, and anemia. It’s also been associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions such as ADHD.

Holy shit.

I *never* would've made the connection between my S.A.D. eating habits - where I suffered from anemia, depression, anxiety,  was chugging Pepto-Bismol, popping headache pills like candy, and had eczema show up out of seemingly no where - to gluten in the foods I was eating. That is a *really* scary, and very sobering, fact.

I've been paleo for a year now and just now realized that I'm not nearly as miserable now as I was then. Perhaps gluten has been the culprit all along!

dusmeyedin,worldnews,1389204917.0,"&gt;At the end of the day, we can't apply standards from 200 years ago to nations today. Its a total copout.

Nor can you realistically expect a developing nation to adhere to the values and priorities of a developed nation.

Well, you personally might, but the Chinese are likely to ignore you. At lower levels of economic resources, priorities become more short term (survival, growth) and much less long term (sustainability, human rights).

Any view that inflexibly expects adoption of high-income priorities by low-income societies is likely to be ignored by the low-income society in question.

I'm also not asking you to turn the clock back two centuries either. Many of the ethnic, environmental, and corporate governance problems faced by China now were identifiable in American norms even in the past fifty years.

My point is that a nation in the process of modernizing will not be the peer of a nation that has already achieved wealthy PPP levels. Thus, the developing nation can rightly expect that it will not realistically be held to those levels.

If even this compromise strikes you as turning the clock back two centuries, then I don't see the possibility for much fruitful discussion."

For an early 1800s train this would be entirely impractical.

I actually watched Season 8 after the person I thought was ""the One"" left me (and proceeded to tell me how she is sleeping around 2 weeks afterwards) so I may be projecting a little but I definitely can relate to and understand Ted's pain when Robin and Barney got engaged. When Ted told Lily that he was planning to leave NYC, I was actually thinking of moving to Seattle and starting over. It was a surreal feeling, seeing Ted, who shares my belief that everyone will eventually find ""the One"" get crushed like that and develop that same need to run away from everything.

Funnily enough, it was that scene that convinced me not to go through with my plans because I saw how tragic and self-destructive Ted was being.

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389205087.0,"&gt;Is there any reason in particular that we only generally use the word to describe either nuclear destruction or the killing of Jews during WWII? Stalin killed many more of his own countrymen. What about Mao?

I think you're confusing the meaning of a holocaust with the Holocaust.  Words for general things can also refer to specific things in the right context.  The best example is that *a* moon (lowercase) is a natural satellite of a planetary body, but *the* Moon (uppercase) is earth's natural satellite.  The other comment already here explains a bit about how the Holocaust came to be the proper noun for one particular mass killing.

In a theoretical way there's nothing wrong with using a holocaust as a general term for mass killing.  But since it goes against most common modern usage (edit: which uses term only for killing during WW2 or nuclear war, as you said), there isn't any reason to either."

I want someone who is busy with his own life so that he's not waiting around for a text from me or and isn't waiting to see if I want to go out again or not.

Would make you hard to date. On my end I do want the above and do try to put forth a modicum of the above. I believe life is about balance and I enjoy hearing that *he* thought of me during the time of day we didn't spend together.

I don't wonder ""why"" someone didn't text but if I'm blown off for long periods of time I feel like they're clearly not interested in me so why should I be interested in them?"

Let me clarify, by ""approaching"" I mean literally doing the flat-out asking of out. In a bar situation, I have no issues talking my ass off to any non-bro cute dude. I'll smile and laugh. Talk to you and only you. Compliment you. Definitely take the correct angles to show off my assets. If we're crazy hitting it off, maybe I'll touch your leg or your elbow. Now after doing all of that, if you DON'T ask me out, I discern you aren't into me. Because if you were into me, after I did everything but crawl into your lap, you would have asked me for my goddamn number. If you didn't do so, anything else done on my part is our equivalent of you texting a girl nine times in a row even though she isn't replying. Like, take a hint.

&lt;&lt;Or maybe we work together, and you're flirty with me, but I figure you're just being nice and I don't think much of it.&gt;&gt;

I wish I could drive this fact into mens' heads, women aren't flirty with men they aren't into. We just aren't. So you SHOULD think much of it, and if you are into me, you should ask me to hang out outside of work sometime. If you aren't expressing interest in me -- which in the situation, presumably the girl is the one flirting, and the guy is the one not flirting -- of COURSE i'm going to assume you aren't into me. Because you aren't responding in kind!"

So smooth and nice.

[Sakanaction - Goodbye/Eureka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWcdyTljEaQ#t=193)  
Another great song from perhaps the best active mainstream band in all of Japan. In some ways they seem to be fairly inert musically, showing a sound which is fairly similar to everything they've done for years. Honestly, that's fine to me since they have so clearly carved out and become so skilled at their own niche.

[Danny Brown - Torture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksaGN5mwAzk)  
I'm not sure I'm completely sold on this album. It's very well produced and it just *sounds good*, but there's something not quite right about it. I really can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the contrast of the first and second half? Most tracks I'll gladly listen to separately, but there's something irking about them once put in a sequence as an album.

[Her Ghost Friend - Ice Planet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm7Wm7pqDuE)

Futurecat3001,mormon,1389205223.0,"Sure thing.  Joe Smith's false prophecy about the current quorum is here:

Jan 21, 1836. HC 2:380-381. Joseph Smith had vision of the future (thus, by implication, a prophecy) in which he saw ""the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, who are now upon the earth... in foreign lands, standing together in a circle, much fatigued, with their clothes tattered and feet swollen..."" He saw ""Elder M'Lellin in the south, standing upon a hill, surrounded by a vast multitude, preaching to them [and performing a miraculous healing]."" He also saw Brigham Young ""standing in a strange land, in the far south and west, in a desert place... preaching to them in their own tongue.."" He also ""saw the Twelve in the celestial kingdom of God."" 

Problem with this is: 
""The Quorum of Twelve as constituted at the time of this revelation never was together in a foreign land as described. William E. M'Lellin never preached in the South, and was excommunicated May 11, 1838, just over two years after the prophecy. Brigham Young never preached to the inhabitants of any ""strange land"" in their own tongue. If Mormon doctrine is correct, five of the apostles seen by Joseph Smith ""in the celestial kingdom"" should never be there, because they apostatized or were excommunicated: Lyman Johnson, Luke S. Johnson, William E. M'Lellin, John F. Boynton, and William Smith.""

Taken from here http://www.exmormon.org/prophet.htm.  A little more research will give you the primary sourcing on all this if you want to find it.

Regarding the moon men, my bad, it wasn't Brigham who saw the Quakers on the moon, it was Josepth Smith.  Source is:

Oliver B. Huntington recorded in his diary: ""The inhabitants of the moon are more of a uniform size than the inhabitants of the earth, being six feet in height. They dress very much like the Quaker style and are quite general in style or fashion of dress. They live to be very old; coming generally near a thousand years. This is the description of them as given by Joseph [Smith] the Seer, and he could see whatever he asked the Father in the name of Jesus to see"" - Journal of Oliver B. Huntington, Vol 2, p 166

Another article talking about it:  https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/035-12-17.pdf

Brigham actually prophesied that there were people living on the *sun*, not the moon.  You can see how easy that is to mix up.  Here's the sourcing for that one:

""I will tell you who the real fanatics are: they are they who adopt false principles and ideas as facts, and try to establish a superstructure upon, a false foundation. They are the fanatics; and however ardent and zealous they may be, they may reason or argue on false premises till doomsday, and the result will be false. If our religion is of this character we want to know it; we would like to find a philosopher who can prove it to us. We are called ignorant; so we are: but what of it? Are not all ignorant? I rather think so. Who can tell us of the inhabitants of this little planet that shines of an evening, called the moon? When we view its face we may see what is termed ""the man in the moon,"" and what some philosophers declare are the shadows of mountains. But these sayings are very vague, and amount to nothing; and when you inquire about the inhabitants of that sphere you find that the most learned are as ignorant in regard to them as the most ignorant of their fellows. So it is with regard to the inhabitants of the sun. Do you think it is inhabited? I rather think it is. Do you think there is any life there? No question of it; it was not made in vain. It was made to give light to those who dwell upon it, and to other planets; and so will this earth when it is celestialized. Every planet in its first rude, organic state receives not the glory of God upon it, but is opaque; but when celestialized, every planet that God brings into existence is a body of light, but not till then. Christ is the light of this planet."" - Journal of Discourses Vol. 13, p.271"

First of all, myth was a greek word that meant ""story"". Second, It wasn't until later times (Socrates, perhaps? Please right me if I'm wrong here) that Myths started to be percieved as mere made-up stories. Myths have, until then, always been read as History. And this is what matters.

More concrete language, more real situations and physicality in your writing, more specificity, more metaphor.

Less forced rhyme, less advice, fewer platitudes, fewer abstractions, fewer proclamations.

Basically, this could use the classic ""show don't tell"" advice. I don't think this advice is best for everyone but i think you could benefit from it.

For example...

&gt; As I struggled and pondered 

how did you struggle and ponder? where did you do it?

gazork_chumble_spuzz,Parenting,1389205565.0,"Glad to hear your dad's doing better! 

&gt;If you ask me personally I think someone who would smoke in an enclosed car that contained anyone else, let alone young children, I think they are definitely being a bad human on the order of someone who didn't vaccinate their children.

And I don't, because if you compare the damage done by smoking to the damage done by unvaccinated people, smoking comes out way, way, way more dangerous. 450,000 deaths per year - that figure does not include all the people who live with chronic respiratory issues as a result of smoking or secondhand smoke. Compare that with the whopping cough and measles outbreaks we hear about in the news - fewer people are affected and far fewer die. That's not to say those deaths and the complications are acceptable; they aren't. But it's far less of a public health threat than cigarettes.

I don't think that smokers are bad people; even the ones who smoke around others aren't *bad*, per se, just kinda selfish about their habit. I also don't think parents who don't vaccinate are bad people...the ones I have met are certain that they've made a choice that's in the best interest of their kids' health.

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389206162.0,"&gt;Whilst the word is now synonymous with the systematic killings by the Nazis, it isn't the only term used. Jews refer to it as the 'calamity' (Shoah) to differentiate it with the sacrificial holocaust of the Bible.

There's a bit more to this.  Even though the Greek term is used to translate the Hebrew *olah*, the Greek isn't a term used by Jews, since very few texts that circulated Jewish communities after the Hellenistic period were in Greek (it's the Septuagint that uses ""holocaust"", which wasn't used much in Jewish communities long-term).  Most Jewish ritual terminology is in Hebrew or occasionally Aramaic (or Yiddish for more modern stuff, though most of it has a Hebrew equivalent that's used in Israel).

Anyway, since ""holocaust"" was a word for mass killling pre-war in English, but not Hebrew, there's no reason Hebrew should've adopted the term.  The religious implications are obscured by translation, but it's not a word that existed in Hebrew.  The earliest use of sho'ah in this context is pre-war, when a newspaper translated a speech calling the Nazi's rise to power a catastrophe as ""a sho'ah"".  The earliest use of it that I can find elsewhere is a pamphlet about the Holocaust, entitled שואת יהודי פולין sho'at yehudei polin ""destruction of the Jews of Poland"" which was written in 1940.  And the term was mostly fixed when Israel called its Holocaust Rememberance Day *Yom haSho'ah*.

While it was the dominant name in Hebrew, Yiddish had (and has) a different term--it's the *khurbn eyrope*, ""European Destruction"", or *khurbn*, destruction.  The earliest publication I can find that uses it is the historical text חורבן לעטלאנד *khurbn leteland* ""Latvian Destruction"" (which is in German, but has a bilingual title), though it may've been used prior to that."

Being a GOOD stay at home parent is really hard, some of us aren't cut out for it and even if we are capable of it we won't be happy doing it.  That's ok! 

When I stayed home I was always finding something, some excuse to bolt from the house the minute my husband got home.  Some errand needed done, I mentally checked out by that point in the day and my kids felt like a chore.

I do understand the concept of keeping people on the hook but I've tried not to be that type. Once I see someone is getting emotionally invested (and I am not) I let them go and hope they can emotionally invest in a good match for them. I'm happy for people who find a good match out there. Not a hater. "

PunxsatownyPhil,skyrim,1389206261.0,"One of the first things you'll do is go to Balmora. I know I did. I joined the Fighters' Guild at level 1, and with some difficulty, killed the three rats. Okay, I kill the egg poachers with no problem too, then head to Caldera mine. I'm level 2 at this point. I walk inside, and oh, there's four assassins all leveled 4 or 5. I give up on that, and go talk to Caius Cosades instead. He sends me to the Fighters' Guild guy, who sends me to the Dwemer ruins. Except there's a mage on the bridge who's a higher level than me who just keeps casting spells. Guess I can't do that, either. I go down to the lava channel below the bridge and try to find a way around. I take shelter in some ruins and try to sleep and regain health. Oh, a rat attacked. Kill it. Oh, a... dark brotherhood assassin? Shit. I die, reload, and get killed by a scamp because I can't hurt it at all.

They really were not nice about levelling areas and gave no indication. After I cleared those dwemer ruins, I went to a cave like right below it and ran into an ash zombie which completely obliterated me. That's when I decided I would not explore, because it would only end up with me dying.

On classes: I chose spellsword my first time. It has long swords as a major skill, and hammers and axes as a minor skill. This is in no way a good idea. If you don't level them, it will be harder to level up, but if you do try to, you won't be able to kill anything.

And if you say that spell failure and hit missing are like a tabletop RPG mechanic, I'll tell you that no good DM would let you fail a roll on a spell like Recall or Heal outside of battle. It would *work.*"

SequenceofLetters,changemyview,1389206586.0,"Personally I think there is a very big difference between rape jokes and most of the other jokes that you are mentioning, and I think that the difference is grounded in the way that rape is thought of in our society. No one thinks that murder is okay. No one thinks that dead babies are okay. There's an unsaid understanding behind every joke of this kind that this is not okay and no one mistakes that. While you might argue that people don't think rape is ""okay,"" obviously some people do, and many others simply don't take it seriously. Victim blaming is incredibly common in our society and as a result rape jokes exist in a space in which there is an ambiguity about the crime itself. There are people in the world who genuinely believe that rape is funny and as long as this is the case rape jokes will continue to support this kind of thought.

Another thing is the risk of triggering someone with a rape experience in their past. I know a lot of people find the idea of ""triggering"" hilarious and stupid, but it's a real phenomenon. Some people have been raped in the past and it's impossible for you to know who they are. It's entirely possible that laughing at a rape joke in someone's presence will trigger their PTSD if they have it, or make it seem like your are laughing at their own rape, which can be incredibly damaging. Even if someone has had a family member murdered or something similar, I don't believe that many people would find murder jokes to be traumatic or personally triggering in the same way. People really don't belittle murder the way they do rape."

I have a friendly-looking face and I habitually/reflexively make eye contact with people, so strangers talk to me pretty frequently. It is one of the reasons I now wear visible headphones out in public, even when I'm not listening to anything.

I like people in general and I find them interesting, but I don't really enjoy small talk with people I'll never see again so I usually prefer to just observe them. If I'm in a particularly ebullient or outgoing mood, or if the topic involved is something I'm really interested in, then I have a lot of fun meeting people and connecting with them and I love it. Once I was going to an event that had an after-party after it, and I had a friend with me for the event but not for the party, so I just found someone else who'd gone alone to the event and befriended her so we'd both have someone to go to the party with later. It worked out wonderfully. 

I also get strange women in clothing stores asking for my opinion about clothes they're looking at. Sometimes that's fun, but usually I'm just thinking, ""She knows I don't work here, right?""

Basically I'm moody about people, so it's hard for me to say how I would react. If it's not a topic I'm very interested in and I'm not already in a friendly mood, then I'm most likely to respond as briefly-yet-pleasantly as possible and then attempt to get back to whatever I was doing."

Make the culture stuff less sex focused, more a frank obvious  boring fact of life, rather than something that held on a pedestal, or something that hidden so much that it becomes a massive curiosity. 

Then the next step may be to only one where the institution of the state can ethically be involved, ban fertility treatment and in vitro fertilization. If you can't reproduce by sexual intercourse, then you can't reproduce by sexual intercourse. If you want kids, adopt. 

Adoption for infants ought to be extremely easy, the younger the easier, but incentivize older children to be adopted, those who will likely have issues. Highly incentivize adoption that have differing phenotype from the adoptive parents.

Avistew,sex,1389206843.0,"At least tell him you have nightmares in which he's hurting you. Then tell him you don't want to share details if you want, he should be able to understand that, but he needs to know he's done nothing wrong.

As for your problem, well I think your nightmares must come from the fact that you feel bad about your fantasy, and so your brain is, in a way, punishing you by showing you how much you'd hate it if it happened for real.

But of course you would. That's why it's a fantasy. And I'm not sure exactly how you can come to terms with the fact that it's okay to fantasize about non-consent... It's not hurting anyone. It's not disrespectful to any real victims and it does not mean you deserve anything bad to happen to you.

If you want to introduce it to the bedroom, start small. For instance when he's on top of you, ask if he could hold your hands and not let go. The first time just stay like that. Another time tell him you want to struggle a bit but he shouldn't let go, that if you want him to stop holding you, you'll actually tell him.

And so on, little by little, introduce a little bit of it. See what happens with your dreams. It's possible that once you'll fulfill your fantasy the dreams will slow down or stop, but it could also make them worse. Play it by ear.

Find forums and other communities of people with that same kink. Maybe you feel guilty because you think your partner wouldn't be into it and don't want to force him to do it. And after all, your fantasy is of him forcing you, not the other way around, so maybe just the idea of having to introduce the idea to him, rather than him coming up with it, seems less sexy?

But you do need to communicate. He must be worried about you and it would be a weight off your chest.

Now, the last issue is how you withdraw from him after such a dream. You know it's not rational but can't help feel that way. Try and remind yourself over and over again that him in your dreams is still you. Everyone in your dreams is you. Everything is your own brain. Nothing he does in your dreams is caused by him, it's just the way you process information at night. And maybe you dream of it because you want it to happen, but you freak out because in the dreams it's actually rape and not a fantasy.

Now, don't force it if it makes you feel worse, but the next time you have that nightmare, and wake up in bed next to him, I think it might help if you hugged him for comfort. Touch can be very powerful and it's possible to ""forgive"" someone just through hugging them. Maybe if you manage to do that, you won't feel the need to withdraw anymore.

Of course, if it makes you feel worse, then stop, take your distance, and tell him what happened (""I had a dream in which you hurt me... I've been having these... I know you never would and I'm sorry for being distant but the dreams kind of mess me up."")

Then maybe you can find a way for you to feel better, together. Maybe hugging something else (a pet, a plush toy, etc). At any rate, you should know that if you ever try your fantasies with him, and you ever ask him to stop, he will (the way you described him, at least. I obviously don't know the guy). So what happens in the dreams wouldn't actually happen.

If it only gets worse, I would suggest a sex therapist. They're trained to help with these kinds of problems, and considering how hard it seems to make your life and your relationship, I think it would definitely be worth it."

Futurecat3001,summonerschool,1389207170.0,"Right away I can tell you your champ pool is holding you back.  The current meta is heavily weighted toward tanky bruiser tops that can leverage the relative efficiency of defensive items and the strength of the new defense mastery tree.  Mundo is a great champ and you should continue to focus on him, but Wukong and Riven top are going to result in some easily beatable team comps without that strong tank presence coming from the top lane.

Both Wukong and Riven are quite strong right now, don't get me wrong.  But Wukong is best played from the jungle and Riven is best played from mid lane.  If you play them top, you may win lane but your team comp is likely to be flawed compared to the enemy team if they keep to more ""standard"" comps within the meta.  Have you noticed that you have a tendency to do very well in lane, then lose when it comes time to teamfight due to your carries being zoned by their tank line?  The current meta is all about having a powerful tank line coming from top lane, and if you pick a team comp that doesn't have this, you are likely to be beaten by a team that does.  

I suggest you take the time to learn Shyvana, Nasus, Olaf, Rengar and Renekton if you want to continue to focus on top lane."

If he becomes Boba Fett Action Hero, or Boba Fett who needs a love interest, or Boba Fett the secretly good guy bounty hunter, the legend will be ruined.  

I strongly hope the bulk of the movie is told from the perspective of the people he's hunting - you learn about them, hear their stories, connect with them, only to have Boba silently slip in and take them out, or thermal detonator the building around them, or something else ridiculous.

notlindseydalton,AskReddit,1389208016.0,"Like some people already hinted at, people have this drive to always do more and achieve more. So if certain things were easy, they'd just strive for something more difficult to attain. However, if EVERYTHING was easy, as in, ""If I ask for a crappy used car, I get it. If I ask for a brand new fancy car, I will get it."" I think it would force us to examine how much we truly want.

It's easy to say ""I WANT MORE!"" because it will take time and work and I'll feel accomplished when I earn it. If I didn't put in time and effort to earn the money to get an incredibly fancy new car, it sort of loses part of its value. Then I ask myself ""do I even really want this?"" I think part of the appeal of expensive objects is the prestige that comes with it. Like if you have expensive brand hand bag, the quality isn't that much higher but you use it so people KNOW you are fancy. 

Also it sort of forces people to understand themselves more deeply. If I don't spend my whole day working so that I can have money so that I can get certain things (house, food etc.) what would I do with my time? I'd have to find hobbies that I truly enjoy. I barely have any hobbies now and the ones I do enjoy I don't have time for, I'm too busy working. So that I can have money. So that I can buy things I don't need but that I feel like I deserve since I worked hard enough to deserve nice things.

Futurecat3001,summonerschool,1389208226.0,"Don't be afraid to use your teleport to impact the bottom half of the map, even if it means giving up your tower.  It is actually very dangerous to take Nasus' tower too early, because he can just freeze the lane near the inner turret and force the enemy top laner to roam while Nasus stacks Q.  If your team knows how to play defensively and has good waveclear to resist tower sieges, Nasus is going to emerge from top lane with 500+ Q stacks in 25 minutes and be able to solo carry his team.

The biggest risk of playing Nasus is tunnel visioning on Q stacking while your team loses - it's important to use everything you can to keep your team from falling too far behind in the early game, so that you have a chance to carry once you hit the mid- to late-game.

Remind your team in champ select that a good comp with Nasus includes strong waveclear for precisely this reason.  He pairs incredibly with mid laners like Ziggs or Orianna who can resist tower sieges indefinitely."

DreadfulRauw,AskMen,1389208327.0,"&gt;At bars without no activities - What do you do? Just sit around and make innane conversation?

Not inane, but yes.  This is the time for your sparkling wit.  Be funny and entertaining.

&gt;At bars with dancing? Is there another way to flirt/express interest? I'm always getting invitations to dance and I cannot dance.

If it's a dance club, that's gonna be the go to move.  Here's the secret.  Guys who can't dance still get more play than guys who won't dance.  she's not looking to see your moves.  She's looking to see if you'll risk looking silly for her.

&gt;On dancing. Is there ever a point where you're not deliberately thinking though every movement? If I stop deliberately trying to move body parts (copying other people), I just end up standing there. This makes it impossible to talk or flirt or do anything other than ""swing hip left/swing hip right"". I've played music my whole life, but the only dancing I have experience with is silly wildly swinging around (as a little kid) and mosh pits (and neither are appropriate for this scene).

Again, just fake it.  Better to be awkward on the dance floor than alone at the bar.

&gt;More dancing - How do I get over the worry that I'll slam into someone if I move to quickly/the wrong direction. I've also spent a lot of time in different types of fighting training, and I'm worried that if I actually manage to get ""lost in the music"" I might carelessly deck someone. Does this actually happen? Or am I worrying over nothing?

Just don't do full on punches or something and you're fine.  If it's informal, unstructured dancing, people bump into each other.  It happens.

&gt;Even more dancing - Do traditional ballroom, swing, mambo, etc classes help in social dancing situations? I'm really terrible at that type of dancing, too.

If you have no rhythm they help, but normally you'll only do those dances at clubs that focus on them.



&gt;Multiple women interested - If you're in a situation (group conversation) where you've developed a good amount of rapport with multiple women who seem interested and you find both interesting, how do you deal with this without making things awkward for everyone? (especially if they are friends)

Pick one.  Or, if you're ballsy, ask them both out.

&gt;After Strike one - If you're in a group situation where you've really hit it off with one of the people, to the point where other people present suggest you go out, but when you ask them out, they are in a relationship. Is it okay to still pursue anyone from the rest of the group? That seems kinda skeezy (working your way through the room) like, so I've always assumed it was bad form.

As long as you're respectful to the first one, and don't start ignoring her, you might be fine.  If she likes you, she might help you with one of her friends.

&gt;One and done? - I've always been of the mindset that you don't want to hit on multiple people in the same group. Is this just naive? If it's kosher, how do you go about it? Do you go ahead and ask in front of the crowd?

Depends on the group, but as long as you're being open and flirty, They'll know why you're there and act accordingly.

&gt;Expectations? - I just moved to a new area and don't have a lot of friends who toke. I invited my next door neighbor over to partake, and we seemed to have a decent friendship going for a while, smoking and BS'ing about our lives. A couple of months ago, she seemed pissed at me for not making a move on her (I'm sort of guessing but in retrospect she dropped a lot of hints) and cut off contact. Am I in the wrong for not making a move and/or not specifying that I was interested in her as a friend?

Not your fault.  she could have made a move too.

&gt;Coed sports - Is it ever acceptable to ask someone out on the field (those moves!)? Is it super tacky to do it in front of their team-mates?

That's the point of adult sport leagues.  you're in your 20's and playing kickball.  If you're not doing it to get laid, it's just a little sad.

&gt;Houdini - If a woman asks you out for drinks ""to celebrate"" after something positive happening, but disappears before you can go out/exchanging numbers/etc, is it better to ask about that thing or just ask her out again? Or give it up?

Just ask her out again.  Don't bring up old stuff.

&gt;Ditching the group - Is it okay to split from the group you are out with to pursue a lady who approaches your group to hit on you. Are there limitations on this? If it's really overtly sexual? If you're someone's ride home?

Depends on the transportation situation where you live.  Don't abandon someone with no way to get home, but it's cool to arrange something else for them if you're going to be hooking up.  This is easier in towns with good taxi systems."

&gt;I did not get my associates, but I did have enough credits to not be required to take the SAT or ACT. I had 52 credits when I transferred.

This is odd, is there some requirement to re-take the SAT or ACT right before transferring? Or do you mean you never got to take the SAT/ACT in high school in the first place? I took the SAT in high school, and I got a score I'm quite proud of; I'd hate to have to re-take it.

&gt;Community College GPA: 3.76 (52 credits)

So far, I only have 27 credits, not including 14 more I'll be taking this upcoming Spring 2014, however, I have a lot of credits from AP's taken in high school (to cover classes like chemistry, english or calculus, assuming the scores are high enough.) Do you think this will hinder my admissions at all? 

&gt;Go a week before classes begin and talk to professors that offer undergraduate research. They usually love the fact that a student takes interest in their work or is actively looking for a position, it shows initiative. Some require certain courses, usually thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, etc.

This is what I'd heard elsewhere, so it's nice to know VT does the same thing. Do you happen to know how it works for extracurricular design teams, like Baja/Formula SAE or NASA USLI? Contact the team advisor and ask them about positions?

Any idea on how applying for undergrad research at places like RoMeLa work? Or is that simply a facility and you contact the professor in charge of whatever project is going on in there?

Finally, do you know how financial aid works over there? I'm completely clueless to the process beyond filing a FAFSA and waiting for a Pell grant imbursement from NVCC (Pell grants have been how I've been paying for school so far, so I have no idea about the timing of applying for loans or scholarships)...

Thank you so much for your response, I'd been secretly hoping a VT transfer would show up in this thread!"

Ok, you raise a fair point there. People with whom you have a prior relationship -- that's trickier, you're right. Sometimes a person just has a bubbly/gregarious personality that comes out once she's more comfortable around you. That's one's just difficult all the way around, I give you.

RodzillaPT,europe,1389208944.0,"&gt;In a pool of 6 million, there aren't many talented musicians so the vast majority of Flemish music just sucks or is geared towards an elderly public.

Portugal only has about 10 million people and this doesn't stop portuguese to make rock and sing in portuguese.


&gt; Also, many of the popular genres started in the US and those are the sounds we are familiar with. Flemish rock, rap, rnb etc would just sound odd and fake. Popular music usually doesn't deviate from what's already out there in the charts.

There's a portuguese rapper that sings something to the lines of:

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389209179.0,"I'm with you.  I was slowly, steadily losing before getting pregnant and I have really struggled.  I find myself having to put effort into eating more because my reduced calorie habits have been so ingrained for so long.  I'm doing ok keeping it in perspective and ignoring the scale but I know it will really hurt if I break 200 lbs, especially with a previous pregnancy to use for comparison.

You are going to be ok though.  I lost my babyweight really easily just by breastfeeding and basic activities with my kids, the only reason I got overweight in the first place is that I stopped breastfeeding and kept eating like I was breastfeeding.  I'm determined not to make that mistake this time.  When it starts coming off and you see the numbers on the scale coming down it is such a relief, and it will help motivate you to keep that downward momentum.

I would warn you though, brace yourself for the comments on your size.  When you're sensitive about the weight you've gained it really hurts to hear comments like ""you don't even look pregnant!""  It's not just you, and it's ok if you respond with the occasional ""Bitch!  Yes I do!""

Avistew,sex,1389209184.0,"I think knowing there is an issue is the main part. Next relationship, you can see what your partner wants and likes and adapt.

I don't think stating what you want is as bad as never stating it and then breaking up because it never happened (as she seems to have done), but it's true it's not right to constantly ask for things and never offer to reciprocate.

About giving oral sex, if you don't want to be bored by it, have you considered 69ing? This way you'll get a distraction of your own.

Otherwise, if you're eating a woman out and getting tired of it, you can always offer to switch to something else. Fingering, or intercourse, or intercourse while you rub her clit, whatever works for you guys. Sex doesn't have to be about doing one thing until climax happens. You can absolutely switch it out!

And don't put too much pressure on her coming. If she enjoyed herself and is fine and happy, then take that as an answer. Sometimes a woman won't be able to come, but if you refuse to stop until she does it will just mean pressuring her, and her odds of having a good orgasm will decrease by the second.

So as you said, better to do things for the present enjoyment. Lick her because she likes is, not because you see it as an investment for a payoff (her orgasm) that might come soon, late or not at all.

As for fingering, just like oral sex, it requires communication. Not 2 women are exactly the same, so be willing to adapt and learn for every new partner. And the same person might require different stimulation from one time to the next so the best advice really i: be flexible and adaptable. Do not watch a howto then follow it religiously every single time regardless of the situation. Getting ideas is good, but then adapt depending on her reaction, and communicate a lot."

slavik262,GlobalOffensive,1389209365.0,"CS is great without them, but it's not fair to claim that sights don't add much to any FPS. They're especially useful in realism-based FPSes, such as ARMA, Red Orchestra, etc. In these games, bullets go where the weapon is pointed. Inaccurate fire is not modeled by a pattern or an increasingly-wide cone of fire like in CS, but by the sway of the weapon due to recoil. Firing a weapon from the hip obviously creates a greater amount of sway than firing from a proper shouldered position. This is not only a touch of realism, but a gameplay element. If you turn a corner and spot an enemy, do you fire from the hip, risking inaccurate and unaimed shots? Or do you take the time to shoulder your rifle, delaying your shots?

The ability to shoulder your weapon also

- Constricts your peripheral vision as you aim down the sights in exchange for more accurate fire

- Allows you to rest the stock of your weapon on the terrain in front of you for more accurate fire (Red Orchestra, and I believe ARMA, take this into account).

I'm not claiming that this sort of system is superior to CS. It's different, and both can be enjoyable. Just don't claim that it adds nothing to gameplay mechanics."

Mr_Diggums,AskMen,1389209401.0,"Dang dude...that's a lot of reflection you done there. My first impressions is that you're thinking about this WAY too much, which is holding you back and making you more self-conscious than need be. That said, here's my two cents.

Bars:
With ""no activities"" you meet strangers and talk. It doesn't have to be inane conversation...get to know people, joke around, flirt, etc. Trust me, it seems weird. I've gotten high and realized that a bar is just a bunch of impaired people yelling bullshit at each other, then proceeded to do just that the next night and have a blast. You'll get better with practice, but maintain the mentality that you're just out to have fun, and not just to meet/bang girls. 

Dancing:
Just HAVE FUN and BE CONFIDENT. If you're so god awful that you can't find and keep the beat, then you might want to pass here, but girls love a guy who is confident enough to dance and have fun, even if he's not amazing at it. Just don't be ""that guy"" who tries too hard. Follow a girls lead yo! If you're invited to dance, accept! Worst case scenario, tell the girl ""I'm not a great dancer, but I'd definitely like to learn"" or ""Practice makes perfect"" or some BS. Anything that shows her you're fun, interested, and not too self-conscious. Eventually, you don't think about the moves you're making, and you just let the music/girl guide you...dancing can be fucking beautifully organic like that.

Other Dancing:
Nothing wrong with taking lessons. Will definitely make you better and is an avenue to meet more girls, but knowing swing/ballroom/salsa doesn't have that much ""run-of-the-mill"" application at your usual bump 'n grind establishment. 

Commuters:
Frankly, I've never tried here, and I just kind of take the same approach as one would at the gym, which is to check-out and not approach. If there are two situations where (I assume) women hate to be bothered, it's at the gym and when they're on their commute (likely reading or listening to music). Plus, it makes for an awkward rejection as there's no where to go. If you're REALLY feeling something, maybe make a comment about something they're doing or wearing or whatever, but I usually just stay clear. Hell, maybe you'll see them at a bar or something and you can mention your commute as an ice-breaker (Hey, do you happen to take X bus to Y in the morning? Me too! *cue insta-sex*)

Multiple Women:
Easy there Casanova. Unless you're dropping $$$ in bottle service, none of these girls are likely looking to sleep with you right away, but are just enjoying yours and the group's company. If you really do think multiple girls at the same table are interested, welp, you'll just have to pick 'n choose or do some recon via mutual friends. If you're looking to date, you don't exactly have the easy option of trying out all of them in a short period of time. Regarding ""strike one"", asking someone out who is unavailable does not exclude you from asking out their friends. A first date is based upon mutual attraction and interest, and you are allowed to be attracted/interested to/in multiple people at once. Just don't make it evident that you're ""running through the numbers"" and you should be fine. It's ok to hit on multiple people in the same group, but only if it's innocent flirtation and not creepy. Otherwise, all of the girls (and their collective opinion) will quickly brand you as the weird creepy do. Be playful, not rapeful. 

Expectations:
If this 420 girl was cool and attractive, then you're an idiot for missing her hints. Cutting off contact seems weird to me (you were just being a nice neighbor), but you really only need to specify you're a friend if you're picking up on the signals. Really shouldn't be that hard to pick up on though after a lot of one-on-one time/toking.

Coed Sports:
You can ask out on the field, but it'd be much easier to let a lil' friendship develop over time and then see if they want to grab a beer or something after the game. That's not a date, it's just a post-game, and if that goes well, you can ask her out properly for a date where y'all ain't sweaty from the field. Save this for later in the season...don't want to get rejected after game 1.

Houdini:
She may just be nice and extended the invitation to everyone. Nothing wrong with following up in some manner. If you don't really know her and don't have her number, might as well let it go. If you're friends or in the same group, doesn't hurt to ask. Everyone likes a fun time.

Ditching the Group:
Are you kidding me? Why in the hell wouldn't it be ok? You know better than this.
In regard to limitations: If you're someone's ride home, if you have a girlfriend, or if you're a rapist/murderer, then it is not OK to split from your group to pursue sexy times with a stranger. Don't cockblock yourself and then insist that it's because you didn't want to split from the group.

...and that has an effect on the market - but the market and the economy are not the same - and there is a cost involved that goes beyond the dollars paid for the bonds.

&gt; Also fiscal stimulus increases the deficit in the short run...

No, deficit went up, and so did the debt.

&gt; whereas monetary stimulus lowers the deficit in the short because it reduces interest rates that debt is re-financed at.

At what cost?"

It can be useful -- we had already determined that my son could benefit from programs for kids with autism before we got the label and getting the label made it much easier to access those programs. But the label itself is not the goal. Especially, in the case of autism, I think the boundaries and definitions are probably going to keep changing through his lifetime.

I assume you have had some pretty thorough assessments done by now -- OT, PT, SLP, developmental etc. Those reports provide a better picture of the issue to be addressed than a label would in any case. The label gives a helpful context to those results that may lead to more useful programs than without the label -- but the assessment results without the label would have you off and running while if you had the label without the assessments you haven't even tied your shoes yet."

a-theism.

a : no/not/without

theism : belief in a god

Literally, without theism, or without belief in a god.

The origin of the term is back in the 16th century, from the Greek ""Godless"". It was initially used to describe any person with a disbelief in a god, not necessarily a denial of a god. The term was not openly used as a self-asserted position until late 18th century in Europe with spread of criticism of religion.

My own personal blog just talks about things that interest me and other nerd girls, the girly/feminist stuff you wouldn't find on mainstream nerd sites (until Mary Sue came along, anyhow). When I started, so many sites were obviously catering to men, I wanted to look at other things, or at the same things from a different perspective.

Focusing on reviews and walkthroughs is a great idea. Make sure you have a unique voice, because again, everyone reviews.

Avistew,sex,1389210095.0,"A piece of advice would be, while you're learning to dominate her, don't ask her things in an insecure manner.

You need her feedback, yes. But make her give it to you. Tell her things.

So for instance, with the safeword, letting her come up with it? Tell her to pick a safeword. Make it her homework. Then if you're gagging her? Tell her how she will express a ""slow down"" or ""stop"" (shaking her head, tapping you on the shoulder, whatever you come up with). Say it matter-of-factly, because you have authority on her and won't be questioned.

It's about confidence. You want her feedback, but you don't want to sound like you""re asking ""am I doing it okay?"" as it breaks the fantasy. So instead, ask more assertive questions. For instance: ""does it hurt?""

And when she answers a question, go ""good girl"". It's important that she doesn't fear giving the ""wrong answer"". The truth is always the right answer. If she's hurting and it's not part of the fantasy, stop whatever is hurting, loosen her ties, whatever.

Just avoid hesitating. Tell her what you're going to do to her, then do it. Make sure she has the option to stop you if it's too much for her.

Whenever it's over, take care of her, tell her she's been very good, hug her, kiss her, etc. Being submissive can sometimes be hard on someone at first, if they end up in the ""sub zone"" they might really crave appreciation or feel used, so make sure you tell her she's been great.

And remember what makes you the dom isn't the specific acts, but who's in control. Oral sex for instance, you can tell her to suck your cock, or tell her to sit on your face. Either way, you're the one who's dominant, whether you're giving or receiving, because you're the one in control."

It's hurtful. I could understand if it was a 7 day trip. He should just give you advanced notice.

2. If he does consider you in future plans, you need to forgive him and compromise on this Japan trip. Do you want a trip together? Do you have issues with trust? All that jazz.

If he doesn't...maybe you guys aren't meant to be dating. Two and a half years is long enough to show respect to your girlfriend's schedule and feelings when making big decisions.

michelle83,GameDealsMeta,1389210849.0,"&gt; I agree that people should be aware that HB is not a charity (although I have no idea if it is or not). I don't agree that HB should be treated the same as any other re-seller. They rank in a very small group of re-sellers doing a lot of good for being what they are.


They are definitely NOT a non-profit organization. They are a privately owned business that makes a profit off of their sales.

I fully support their business model. I think it's innovative and massively beneficial to all parties involved. I look forward to each new bundle and I'm thankful for the service they provide - as well as the inspiration they gave to other businesses to provide similar services.

However, you are mistaken if you believe their contribution to charities sets them apart from other businesses. Almost all of the top corporations in the US contribute millions of dollars to charities every year - even Wal-Mart (ranked number 2 overall for top contributions to charities in 2012, giving away $311,607,280 in cash alone). Yes, that is a drop in the bucket for a company that size, but I'm sure it was still quite helpful to the charities that received it.

Companies have tax incentives in the US to donate to charity, so it's much more common than you think. Most companies don't use the fact that they regularly make these contributions as a way of advertising their products or services, tho. 

Gamers that cry ""But it's for a good cause!"" as an excuse for anything Humble Bundle does is really quite idiotic. There are much better ways of contributing to charity than purchasing a bundle if that's really such an important issue for you. HB is a business that has to hold itself accountable for any action it takes. From what I've seen, they simply need to be more vocal with their customers and provide simple explanations for changes they implement. In not doing so, they leave themselves open to criticism, and rightfully so."

duckduck_goose,OkCupid,1389211023.0,"Well, and naturally, this was quite insightful.

It's interesting to me in pondering some of this thread how the couples I felt were on an easy road early on burned out bright a lot faster than those who had a tougher time. I was in NYC earlier this year and talking to a friend who met his gal on OKCupid. He was recently divorced from his HS Sweetheart so I thought how naturally he would fall into a LTR quickly. I guess in my mind she was easy and effortless. Instead I learned she was dating a married couple (he was all NOPE on that yo) and she blew up his phone with hysterical please don't end it calls (whoa I'd probably freak out) and how their whole first two dates were beyond awkward for him. He said he felt like it was all part of a corny movie when she paused to ask if he wanted to go upstairs.

A lot of my dates off OKCupid have been corny and almost structured by the other person to get to an end goal (sex). Strangely this last one of 2013 ended up being really effortless once it came together. Though I think there was a lot of complications on both sides. I actually wonder if we talked less (3 chats and a date) if we'd even be friends."
Thornnuminous,changemyview,1389211024.0,"I also think that you don't know what you don't know. Frequently, when people idolize a job or a relationship or a place or whatever they think they understands it's ups and downs, but the fact of the matter is, until you are there, living it, doing it, you just *don't* know what it actually involves.

There is no way to know. Sort of like pregnancy. A woman can read up on pregnancy until she's blue in the face, but until she goes through it, she can't *know* what it's really like. And by then, if she doesn't like it, or (perhaps) develops serious medical problems that couldn't be foreseen, it's too late. She's in it. She has to deal until it's over, one way or the other. 

You *think* you've got a handle on what it is it be a SEAL and what it means, but you don't. You've got a fantasy in your head. *Could* it be as you imagine it? Possibly. Is it likely? No. 

The fact of the matter is, you are *whining* about not wanting to finish college, a very important gift many people can't or won't get, because you want what you want when you want it. This is childish. It lacks discipline.

You, as you are, are not *FIT* to be a SEAL. 

Because you can't even discipline yourself to achieve a degree in three years, which is REALLY important and amazing, and you can't discipline yourself to the *patience* to wait to enlist and try for SEALS.

Futurecat3001,summonerschool,1389211040.0,"I'm a pretty aggressive Nasus player, even very early.  His innate lifesteal is such that you get ahead on trades as long as you can stay in the creep wave and continue autoing/Qing.  If you let the enemy laner bully you without response, eventually they will zone you or push you into the tower and your lifesteal isn't being used to its full effect.  If you auto them a few times and give them a Q/E once in a while, very few top laners will be able to keep up with your sustain.  

Don't go accepting random all-ins though, especially from laners that don't depend on mana.  Riven, Renekton and Rumble are some of your hardest matchups because they don't give a fuck about resources and will just offer you all-in trades over and over.  The proper answer to this is calling for your jungler to come for free kills to punish their mindless aggression (League is a team game after all - you can't solve every problem yourself).

I don't really factor my Q into my ability to make plays.  Just being there at the right time is enough to swing an objective fight in your team's favor.  I will say I am actively looking to teleport bot lane around level 6 though, just because his ult is so good at killing dragon.  If the enemy bot lane gets forced back or their jungler shows topside, there's a good chance I'm thinking about making a play for dragon.

In teamfights Nasus is a complete monster.  Withering the ADC is more than enough to win you a teamfight even if all you do otherwise is stand in the tankline with your E/R going.  Don't overextend to Q their ADC if it means you will get peeled and kited without your team being able to engage.  Just be a tankline presence that punishes autoattackers for engaging with your W."

This is entirely prejudicial.  All languages have changed because of sounds being made ""easier to articulate"".

&gt;I was told growing up that the word ""negro"" morphed into ""nigger"" when misspelled... the ""o"" and the ""r"" being transposed into ""negor"" (phonetically, ""nigger"") due to low education and intelligence.

See [here](http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=nigger&amp;allowed_in_frame=0).  It's not a southern development, though it is related to ""negro"".  But inverting the order of sounds doesnn't indicate stupidity any more than pronouncing ""comfortable"" as ""comfterble"" does.

&gt;They moved to California just after the Civil War, and no one in our family can remember anyone having a ""southern drawl"" (including my grandparents' recollections of their grandparents' speech)

If they came from the south (they = your great-great-grandparents) came from the south they almost certainly had a southern dialect.  There are areas where upper- and lower-class southern accents are different, and 100+ years ago the dialect situation was markedly different.  They may've spoken Coastal Southern, a dialect which today exists only in Charleston, SC.  It lacks features which are today widespread throughout the south, such as the pin-pen merger and the southern shift.  In fact, in Charleston today the upper-class dialect preserves those distinctly non-southern English features, while other include the features found elsewhere in the south.

AgentMullWork,beermoney,1389211539.0,"This might be slightly too dense, but I believe the core concepts are fairly easy to understand. This probably just creates more questions than answers though. I wanted to write this out for my own benefit, while trying to help others understand bitcoin and litecoin better. 
  
Mining is a process used to verify transactions in cryptocurrencies into blocks. Bitcoins only live in the block chain, and only exist because the block chain says they do. When miners mine, they make it impossible to alter previously verified transactions in older blocks by adding a new block on top of the stack. This is what makes bitcoin so secure. To counterfeit or alter bitcoins, you would need a computer network larger than the current bitcoin network, which is already 200x more powerful than all the largest super computers in the world combined.
  
  
Miners take all the transactions they have collected from the network since the last block was found, and run them through a one way math equation (cryptographic hash). Hashes have several interesting properties. While they are easy for computers to perform, they can't be backsolved, and a tiny change in input drastically changes the output. If you hash ""Hello"" you might get ""14FU6J96ZbhqpYtudeqevCSb53r1zPWpdo"", but if you hash ""Hello."", notice the period, you'll get a completely different hash, like ""9jpSTgPHbBD4GyUiVdk9ryNgQQQ1WJEyBE"". This makes it incredibly easy to notice altered data since any change at all will completely change the hash. MD5 is one hash that is used very often by developers and users to ensure programs or file data hasn't been altered, either because of simple corruption, or malicious intent.  
  
So by hashing all of the transactions in a block, you make it impossible to alter the data without having to recalculate that block's hash. Now here's the part where shit gets secure. By including the hash of the block before it you create an unbroken chain of blocks that cannot be altered without also re-solving the hash of every single block after it.  
  
Now, this would actually be a trivially easy thing to accomplish if it wasn't for the key innovation: the proof of work requirement. Proof of work aims to make the whole process more secure by requiring that each block takes around 10min to solve. Since hashing takes less than a second to accomplish, the 10 minute target is attained by requiring the block's hash to begin with a certain number of 0s. So just like in my ""Hello"" example, where a small change has dramatic results, miners add random numbers (called a nonce) to the block until they find a hash with the specified number of 0s. They just guess and check over and over until one miner finds the right nonce that produces the correct hash. Once the right nonce is found, the block is considered solved, sent to all the other miners who verify that it is in fact the correct answer, and the finder get 25 bitcoins deposited to their address. Then everyone moves onto the next block. Since it takes roughly 10 minutes per block for the aforementioned bitcoin network, with 200x the power of the worlds supercomputers, the result is a very secure, very verifiable (since you can trace all bitcoins to the moment they were created), very computationally expensive to alter public ledger.  
  
So by mining coins, you are verifying transactions, and protecting the network from attacks by adding to the total speed of the bitcoin network."

aDDnTN,AskEngineers,1389212388.0,"&gt; Pressure: The force that a ~~gas~~ fluid exerts on the walls of its container

the difference is small, but important.

for ""level"", they might want to you discuss ""hydraulic head"". among those other items that usage of ""level"" is the most applicable.

for the type of applied engineering that the firm does, they want you to concisely in simple terms define those terms and show how they are all inter-related as far as the companies application of those concepts.

Temperature, Pressure, Head, and Flow are all closely inter-related in hydraulic and thermodynamic design. Discover how by examining a fluid dynamics or engineering hydraulics book.

Hint: Volume or area (some fixed measure of input volume) is not included, so it must be assumed to be equal or known and therefore the concept is not valid for their interests. in other words, they are thinking steady-flow or continuous supply.

remember that engineers and techs that have been in a field for a long time (and are not really the sort to look around often) will often be less elastic in terms of their thoughts and less considerate of how other professionals might use the same units differently. they can be narrow-sighted to the point of being unable to reason why they are doing a particular action, citing rhetoric or historical performance as reasons, but knowing WHY you are are doing something to learn HOW something is happening, is critical to performing science and applying it, and literally the essence of being an engineer.

if you find yourself in the company of ""engineers"" that feel strongly in favor of sentiments like ""our's is not to reason why, but to do or die"", you should not challenge them and gtfo asap. It is the sole purpose of engineers to always question WHY and HOW they are doing something. Rhetoric and Habit get people killed and waste huge sums of money."

As for ""At what cost?"" The cost is higher NGDP growth, but that was destabilized so that was the goal. 

That higher growth however, was largely fictional.  Let the Fed stop QE and watch what happens.  Just the suggestion that they are going to taper is enough to hammer the markets.

&gt; I guess you could say it was ""inflationary"", but by that definition we were heading towards deflation which is below the federal reserve's target.

QE is not immediately inflationary as the vast majority of the created money went into excess bank reserves rather than directly into the economy.

As to deflation, that would probably be a good thing atm - the real inflation rate is far higher than the official rate - which is destroying the retirement savings and livelihoods of millions of Americans."

itsjusttoored,changemyview,1389212601.0,"So you say (I think, anyway - I'm a little tired at the moment, so please correct me if I'm wrong) that we shouldn't make rape jokes because they reinforce in a rapist's mind that what they do is okay. 

Assuming that we are not trying to encourage negative behaviour, why should it stop there? One could make a joke with a punchline about murder, and a person with a tendency to think homicidal thoughts could better rationalise their own thoughts and potential actions after this. Sure, murder isn't as socially ambiguous as rape can be, but these jokes are more common and murder is even more so in popular culture.

A joke containing violence could go the same way - assault is a much more common crime in many areas (where I live getting jumped is an expected occurrence almost all the time), and therefore much more socially 'acceptable' in that environment. Could that joke lead to more violent crime?

To wrap up my rambling, your argument against rape jokes could be substituted into almost any form of joke, which diminishes your argument slightly. Once again, not entirely sure how correct or wrong I am in explaining my point and interpreting yours, so please feel free to correct me."

I am sort of coming to appreciate longer smokes as they are useful in certain situations but I felt I should ask anyway. I suppose new maps could allow for the potential to use them and leave it up to the particular players/teams to decide if they want to find one that works for them.

People should leave you alone about it eventually. Took my husband marrying me before we stopped being asked if he was sure i wasnt just using him. So. Fucking. Insulting.

gravesville,explainlikeimfive,1389212973.0,"&gt;Okay. You would not suffer skin friction drag, but you would still be subject to pressure drag. Which might lead you to think you would be faster. But you because you can't cause any friction on the water you can't propel yourself nearly as well. Most of the force generated when you swim isn't actually from the water you push on directly. It's from the water that it sucks along with it. This is known as the venturi effect. If you cant drag water and cause this vorticity you can't propel yourself. If you had a different source of propulsion like a propeller then yes you would be faster.
As far as buoyancy is concerned. It would be marginally different. The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the water your body displaces.You are still (almost) the same size so there is no effect on buoyancy.

firematt422,pcmasterrace,1389213448.0,"I have to disagree. And, I will brace for downvotes. Here goes...

Let me start by saying I don't own an Alienware, and I did build my own machine, though I am very new to the whole PC side of things. 

Having now experienced both sides fully, PC gaming can be much more rewarding if done in the right way and for the right reasons. And, dare I say it... console gaming does have a couple upsides (hold on... bear with me. I didn't say it was better. It's not. But, it offers a few things.). 

The Alienware machines are very expensive, and not really comparable to something you could build yourself at the same price point. No question. But, you also have to factor in the cost of Alienware's overhead, design and time. And, for some people, money is no object and buying a prebuilt machine is an easy segue into PC gaming. It's worth the money to some people to have a plug and play experience. Alienware is about as close as you can get to that without being a console (until the Steam Machine really gets going). If anything, I would say that the avenue Alienware provides only helps bring people over from the console side. 

Even if the new PC gamers are a little disappointed with the graphics/performance of their Alienware machine after the initial sheen wears off, there are many other upsides to PC gaming like more adult oriented communities, indie games and **upgradability** which should keep them in pursuit of PC Nirvana, even though their first foray into PC gaming was somewhat uneducated and underwhelming. They now have a decent base to build from, and an established interest in PC gaming over console.

Consoles are just easier. That's a fact. That's why you don't hear so many pirate-mouthed 4th graders on PC multiplayer as you do on console. I know PC gaming seems so simple to most of you, but that is because you've been doing it for so long. Compatibility issues are the biggest thing. Fear of a keyboard and mouse is another. I'm not saying it's right... but it exists, and telling people that they are stupid doesn't make them any more confident in their ability to make the switch.

If we really want to help the image of PC gaming we shouldn't be attacking producers of machines or games or even the dirty peasants. We should be out there showing people how much better of an experience it can be, and more importantly how easy and rewarding it can be to build a computer yourself. There is no soldering, no programming, no degree in computer science necessary. I know that sounds ridiculous, but people really think those sorts of things are involved. 

I know I went off topic from Alienware pricing, but I just don't think that's the real issue. People use consoles because they are easy and because they are comfortable. The justifications by price or exclusive titles are just to hide the fact that they are scared to try because it looks complicated and they don't know where to start or if they can even do it. I've lurked around here for a while, and I would like to see this place become a little more about acceptance, community, and information, and less about gloating, screenshots of ignorance and console bashing.

temp9876,BabyBumps,1389213536.0,"I can't give you specific answers from experience, but I can give you an accounting answer on how to budget and shop this and send you over to [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/budgeting-for-baby.asp) for some well researched info.

Go to your regular grocery store, wherever you shop most often, take a notebook and a pen and a calculator/your phone.  Make a chart and document the prices for diapers and wipes for 

 * the store brand (should be the cheapest) and the least expensive name brand, should be a brand that you recognize without looking it up (ie huggies, pampers)

 * the largest bulk box and the smaller emergency pickup size packages

 * multiple sizes from newborn plus [size chart](http://diaper-sizes.org/)

This will give you a good range of info for building your budget, follow the same process for formula and wipes, don't be afraid to hang out in the aisle reading labels.

You should plan your BUDGET so that you expect to spend about the mid-range price per diaper.  When you're actually shopping you want to clip coupons and shop sales and do your best to get the absolute best price you can, but you should BUDGET so that you have wiggle room.  If baby craps every ten minutes for a week you want to know that there is room in the budget to pick up an extra bag of diapers to hold you over until payday.  Doing the research in advance will also tell you what the price to beat is when you're shopping around and help you make good cost/benefit choices if you find that the cheapest diapers are cheap for a reason.  Doing it at the place you are most likely to pick up diapers also saves you from over spending for convenience later.  Still shop around, but you're unlikely to add an extra store to your errands with a baby just to save a few dollars on one item."

All bills were my own. Parents helped me pay for lessons for about a year.

Working part time wont work. Either you will be working at the barn to reduce your costs in conjunction with working part time, or you will be working multiple part time jobs. I was working 3 jobs at a point to keep her, also while in university. You will need to decide to sacrifice all semblance of a life if you are to make it work. Luckily I had a great support team at the barn who were generous with hand me downs/ and a coach who let me borrow equipment, as well as incredibly lucky with a fairly low maintenance horse (She still got the best care, 4 shoes, injections, etc. but no chronic problems)

She was/is completely unsellable and I have committed to the fact that she is a forever horse. Tons of talent, completely neurotic and not rideable by anyone else.

I don't regret my horse but I'm now 25, still have her, and my parents let me live at home because I'm essentially paying a mortgage on my horse and they understand how important she is to me. I do frequently feel that had I realised what I was in for, I should *not* have purchased her at 16 and made such a committment at such a young age. My formative years have completely centered around her.  

I do owe her for teaching me so, so much and I will have her until the day she dies. But I would have lived a completely different life if I didn't buy her. 

Also, I do not feel I will ever own another horse again after her. Lease, maybe. "

lady_cardamom,AskMen,1389213940.0,"&gt;Well, from what I read earlier, it seems like some people are just hoping that they can avoid the rejection and have girls flocking to them instead.

Yup. Also, girls get rejected ALL the time when they flirt with dudes. It's not like we're avoiding rejection by not asking ""want to go out?"" There's plenty of rejection in batting your eyelashes and making longtime conversation with a dude, then watching him ask some other chick for her number.

&gt;But usually things that say that I'm interested are if I flirt (obviously), if I talk about getting together outside of work, if I joke around more with you, stuff like that, the usual.

Exactly! I mean, if guy talks about getting together after work, she could totally be like 'oh yes lets! hmm... so there's this new place that opened, did you hear about it?' or whatever. 

&gt;I guess my whole point for being hesitant at first is just that when it's light flirting or even sometimes a little more than that, we may not react because we aren't sure what signals we're getting.

That's not insane. But I will say, when guys want to go out with a girl bad enough, they do ask her. They make a move. (And we've SEEN this, so of course that's what we're waiting for.) But ONLY when the opportunity cost of not doing so is high enough. I think I would rather wait to run across a guy who finds the opportunity cost of letting me get away too high to walk off :) (And why shouldn't I take the risk? Because every girl knows guys only want 8+s to make these moves. If you aren't an 8+ there is seldom an opportunity cost high enough to employ cognitive dissonance and ask him in the face of his disinclination to ask you.)"

If you aren't sure about what you're looking for, they likely still have their Wednesday Wino nights. I think it's $30?

They also have other wine specials through out the week that may be worth checking into.

ruat_caelum,arduino,1389215070.0,"There is no reason there will not be interface boards. Serial communication from your ardunio projects to 'other things' including pis, your laptop, your wifi connection etc. 

The beauty of the arduino is that it is very much a hobbyist platform. Granted the AVR chips can be programmed and built to do very complex things, but the purpose or fame of the ""arduino"" AVR set up is the hobbist. The reality is many people are happy with flashing led boxes, or making doors unlock with secret lock codes, or small robots that roll around, or automatic-whatevers. Then you get mid range guys building quardopeds and hex rotor helicopters. The guys building there own security systems or complicated chemical controls (distillation towers with reflux and multi level taps.)

Then you have the pros. They started with Arduinos, then moved to ATtinys85 or other AVR chips, then they looked into pcb board prototyping. Now they still use the AVR architecture but they use surface mount chips and eaglesoft design layouts. They sell PID controlers to small businesses or automate older C&amp;C machines, They've set up rapid prototyping  machines or run hacker spaces.

**TL;dr** The Edison, like the Arduino, or PIC chips, or the PI is simply a tool in a tool box. The people use them to bring function and form to their ideas. Most of the hobbyist arduino uses still have no idea of the vast potential in a single AVR chip (the base of the ""arduino"") We could build satellites with these. Self-fixing mesh networks, flying robots, segway-like reverse pendulums, PID loops within PID loops within PID loops - All running in real time! with turning and auto-corrections taking place on the fly. Because the ARduino is the simplest (relatively) to get into it will be around for a long time, most of us hobbyist types will never want for power or cpu cycles if we stick with AVR chips."
pandapolarbear,wemetonline,1389215075.0,"Yes. We tell our friends about each other and we don't 'cheat' on each other, as in we've established our boundaries as far as what we'd consider cheating. It's so hard though being apart to really call it a relationship, even though it is one to us. It's just geographically hard. BUT we don't think it's useless, I don't know, some people see calling it official as making it your facebook status, as telling your family and friends, or as something else. 

For us, it's being apart of each other's lives as much as we can be being so far apart. My friends know about him, and ask about him as does my father. And I talk to one of his best friends pretty frequently. Ehhh it's whatever works for you. :)"

lemonylips,AskWomen,1389215087.0,"I mean- a lot of people with body mods *do* face judgement for it.  There are a lot of people who think tattoos are a sign of low intelligence or are tasteless or just simply look bad, women especially are often judged morally based on the placement of tattoos, and many employers make a point to specify that employees may not have any visible body modifications or unnatural hair colors.  Society greatly favors those without tattoos/atypical piercings/wacky hair colors.  It's all still seen as very much relating to subcultures and deviance.  It's still ""alternative.""

But if you're the odd one out then you're the odd one out.  Like when I was in school it *was* seen as weird that I didn't have *any* mods going on.  So I feel that.  Though it seems silly to (as I read in one of your other comments) judge yourself by someone else's standards.  If a guy likes women with body mods, that doesn't say anything about you.  You're not unattractive just because some guy likes tattoos and you don't have any."

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1389215707.0,"k, but my point is, genuine love requires knowing a person, and you can't know a person well enough at 2 weeks to know if you love them.  i get being swept up in the moment - and it's great if the person you're in NRE with ends up being someone you're seriously compatible with long term!  That's the ideal situation, really.  I'm just throwing out my two cents as an impartial observer that if a 35 year old guy is proclaiming love more than once just a month or so in, that doesn't speak to a high level of emotional maturity, in my opinion.  Or maybe he has a different definition of love than I do.  I am very wary of NRE as a potentially crazymaking destructive force, so that's my own bias.

I wish I had advice for your jealousy issues, but I don't.  I feel about my husband the way you feel about your boyfriend - which is why when we opened up our relationship we make an agreement to not seek out romantic relationships with other people (while acknowledging that serious feelings CAN develop from having sex with people and that basically we'll cross that bridge when we come to it depending on how we're both feeling about the situation.)  

But as you're a long time poly person, you obviously know all the advice on how to handle jealousy, insecurity, etc.  But it's not working for you.  I don't know.  Maybe you just want to be mono?  Or at least mono with him?

The reason so many people starved to death, or left the country to avoid starving to death, was because the English landowners wouldn't allow their tenant farmers to eat from their bounty.

windjackass,OldTimeHockey,1389215773.0,"&gt; The assist point value is fine, I think, and raising it will devalue goals scored. We don't need Crosby being the league destroyer.

That's a fair retort. My main argument is that Dmen get far more assists than goals. Raising blocks and hits will give more value to depth Dmen like Girardi, Schenn, Smid, Gorges, etc, but raising the value of assists should give more value to those PP quarterbacks, and possibly give guys like Doughty, Weber, Chara, etc a chance of being drafted in the first few rounds.

&gt; I don't think PIMs should count for much, so I would be against raising them. That may be a philosophical objection - I've never understood why PIMs, which typically put a real team at a disadvantage, would be valuable in the fantasy version.

Again, PIMs are scored to give some (any) value to your depth skaters. Typically, 3rd and 4th line grinders, as well as 2nd and 3rd pairing Dmen are virtually absent from rosters in this league. Adding value to PIM will diversify our lineups greatly, and potentially make guys like Colton Orr or Zenon Konopka as valuable as guys like Lee Stempniak or Michael Ryder, giving us a great deal more diversity in our options.

&gt;I think your tinkering with goalie points will devalue them too much

I would like to see goalies devalued more. That was the main purpose of this post. I can appreciate that you drafted Rask and are reaping the benefits of this solid decision. I drafted Niemi last year, and would have been a lot less inclined to want his value lowered as well. Ditto with Lundqvist this year. The main issue is that there aren't close to enough stud goalies to go around in a 14-team league. Two guys with Rask/Price and MAF/Niemi are going to end up throwing the curve far too hard with present scoring.

&gt; Decreasing player adds per week is fine with me if you want to make churning a less viable option. But, again, the downside is that people set their line ups for the week and then don't look at it again except to check the scores.

Someone else mentioned this in the thread, and I can get behind promoting league activity through lots of player add. I'd rather championships not be determined by teams riding the hot hand throughout the season, but I'm glad there's back-and-forth discussion on this and I'd like to see lots more.

As compared to ""computing"" there is little the Arduino has issues with. The MHZ you see in modern computers is doing ALOT in terms of graphics and sloppy programming.

Your Arduino is not. You can flip pins from high to low in one operational step (@8mhz and roughly 61 Degrees F) this takes about 2us (microseconds, i.e. 1k miro seconds = 1 milisecond, and 1k millisecond = 1 second, granted the first thing you learn -&gt; DigitalWrite(2, HIGH) takes uppwards of 50us.

also, silica sand is the main ingredient in GLASS! furthermore, silica sand is what glass becomes when you crush it!

So this waste product, glass, that is otherwise refuse, but that it can be crushed down and recycled (back into sand!!!) is MORE expensive than sand? How can we afford glass bottles for $1 beer night?!?

So many people act like unvaccinated children are Typhoid Marys who are going around infecting everyone with diseases, and that is not the case. 

I also don't think that this issue is nearly as black and white as you're making it by declaring people ""bad humans"" for not vaccinating, nor do I think it's reasonable to compare it to drunk driving.

ruat_caelum,arduino,1389217232.0,"* Separate the HARDWARE from the SOFTWARE - i.e. this can read temperature but don't explain how (it's not really important how it reads it only how it interfaces with the arduino, so analog temps output in varying resistance, where digital ones do serial communication)

* Separate CODE from HARDWARE - for the most part they don't need to think of how to code something to select a hardware piece (tied tightly into the suggestion above.)

* Teach planning steps, weather that is pesudo code or sketches or some basic math to see if a rotor can produce enough thrust to pick up a batter pack that powers it?

My suggestion to the hacker spaces is to wow them and the parents that bring them. Show videos of hex-copters that fly, or reverse pendulums (segways) or controllers that run 3 nested PID loops to perfectly distill moonshine (ok this one if for the adults.)

Then go through the project in steps. First discuss the hardware sensors or actors needed to make this happen. Actors can include motor, or valves, or fans, or whatever that you control that moves, or heats up, or turns on etc. The ""physical"" side of your output. The sensors are the ""physical"" side of your input.

Then go though the decision tree on what the device ""does"" This is where you show them pseudo code in more and more complicated steps (as you get deeper into the code.)

Step one - what is my (hex-copter) orientation? (don't explain how it gets this information yet that is for later)

step two - correct that error a bit until flatter (more level)

step three - repeat.

Simple explanation of how a quad-copter or hex-copter stays level. The program is very complicated but the beauty of programming is that you can break problems down into functional and logical problems. Then you solve that problem (Maybe you create three more problems while solving but those have solutions too!)

For instance then you would look at step one in more detail. HOW does the hex-copter know its orientation? What sensors does it use?

Then look at step two what actors does it use to make this change? Are there flywheels for gyroscopic forces, or simple speed changes to rotors? perhaps weight is moved around to change the center of gravity?"

(the truck usually came every week) One time i had a day off, and the other porter had the day off too, so they let a cashier take care of the bottle room. the truck came the morning before so i wasn't worried about leaving a note about the room. when i came back, it took 3 hours to get the whole room to usable again (I had to close the whole returns area to sort it out). there was 2 shopping cats in there, one sideways, someone had slashed a bag of plastic confetti while putting it in there, and there was a tote of broken glass in front of the door open. and no history of who had taken care of the room. i lost it and had an hour long screaming match with my manager when she made a comment about how I hadent gotten something inane done.   

the other time was Christmas eve. we had 2, 3 bay receiving docks. one on each end of the building. one for produce, meat, etc, and the other for grocery and dairy. both had full size compactors. one for cardboard, one for trash. now, when I punch in and go down to the sales floor, the girl i know in florist asks me if I could bring her trash back because she could not get back there. WTF... I agree, and when I get back there, I was horrified. every department had just been leaving their trash back there for someone else to do, and me being the first porter on, got to do it. somewhere to the tune of 30 shopping carts piled with trash bags, with more at the door because there was no floor space left... it took thirty minutes to get to the compactor door, and 8 hours to get it all in the compactor. thankfully my manager realized how much a a PITA it was to do all that and gave me $25 store credit "

In one instance a sports car had crashed on a muddy road and a farmer was being prosecuted for spreading the mud on the road and the police used the lecturer to prove the mud was from the farmers field. 

The samples the police had taken were found to be from almost a week later as they had salt that had been spread by the council. The police had said they took all samples straight away and tried to maintain this stance despite the evidence. I believe nothing was done against the farmer because of the way the police carried out the investigation so poorly and lied about it later.

ruat_caelum,arduino,1389218379.0,"using the assembly command of `nop;` will command the processor to do no operation for that step without breaking the pipeline which is a delay of 2 microseconds at 8 megahertz and 60-70 degrees Fahrenheit. 

You can use this in a loop as well but you need to have the memory for the loop iterator set up before or that memory allocation step is a variable amount of time. Assume 2us for each ""cycle"" and an additional 2us for voltage to stabilize on pin changes.

i.e.

    x =0;

    // time critical area.
    for(;x&lt;10;x = x+1)
        {
        nop;
    }

The above would delay as follows. 1 cycle to compare x to 10 and not branch, 1 cycle to add 1 to the register that X is in, 1 cycle for nop; this happens 10 times with 1 additional cycle for the branching step when x is no longer less than ten for a total of 31 cycles or 62us. You can't realy get around the branch but you can just run it a third of the time you need to delay so for 300us delay run this to x&lt;100.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,sex,1389219090.0,"&gt; It turns me on when I know I am in control of her getting off.

So then it's a win-win. She's telling you that she wants you to ""use her"" to get off because that, in turn, gets her off. She wants you to focus on what you want. 

I've dated many girls who are the same way and it's great! I have a feeling she wants you to physically control the situation. Don't ask her for a blow job. Say ""I want you to suck my cock"" and then when she goes for it stop her and say ""but not yet"". First I want to fuck you. Then physically move her into position and go for it. Lead the whole thing by deciding the positions and physically controlling her. Continue this type of physically and mentally dominating behavior and try to stay in ""character"".

You should really think of this as indulging yourself. If you want to do it...do it. Want her to sit on your face? Tell her to. Don't think of what she wants outside of ""being dominated"". It'll be more real that way. Slowly push the boundaries of what you want and she'll let you know when you've reached her threshold of comfort. Just really enjoy yourself and be receptive to her actions. In the mean time, hold off your orgasm until she gets off at least once. From my experience the submissive types can end up coming many, many times during one session, but try to finish the affair with your own climax.

After it's over, do the cuddling, loving thing (assuming she's into that). Thank her for trusting you to do that stuff and kiss her whole body. She'll be counting the minutes until the next romp.

Good luck."

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389219110.0,"Your main issues are still depression and anxiety.  There's a chemical component to those, but you're also still living entirely in your own head and unable to enjoy the moment.  Have you thought about Cognative Behavioral Therapy (CBT)?  It has a really good track record for helping the negative thoughts (cognitions) that lead to the spiral of anxiety and depression. 

Also as others have said, you need to get on meds that a) work for you and b) don't kill your libido.  In conjunction with CBT or other therapy.

But obviously your relationship, in the meantime, has reached a breaking point.  An open relationship is going to fix anything, it will just lead to more anxiety, resentment, and depression for you.  So that's off the table.  Your wife doesn't sound willing to wait for things to turn around.

You may not have a choice whether she leaves you or not, but for now a trial separation might help release some of the pressure.  You're both miserable.  You aren't going to be able to get yourself fixed psychologically when you feel your entire marriage is riding on that, day to day.  There's no way out of that.  You have to just let go of her for now - maybe forever - while you focus on fixing yourself.  Maybe you can get your depression and anxiety under control on your own, for YOUR sake, not hers, and then the two of you can explore rekindling your relationship.  

You want to say anything to keep her, but remember, you love her.  Don't you want her to be happy?  She can't be happy with you until you're healthy, and you aren't going to be able to get healthy if you're terrified of her leaving unless you're faking it.  This is no way to live.

Mental illness is a bitch.  I feel for you.  Just please don't focus on trying to keep her around, you both need to do what's right for you.  For you, that's getting healthy."

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389219146.0,"There are LOTS of things you can do to ""make the first move"" or at least move things along short of just asking a guy out. Break it down into individual moves so it's not so intimidating.

First, approaching someone is not the same thing as asking him out. If you're afraid of social consequences, just be a little strategic about it. You don't have to walk up and say, ""Hi there, I think you're hot and I want to talk to you."" You can walk up and say, ""Hey, do you know who's playing tonight?"" or ""Can you believe how crowded this place is?"" or ""Do they serve vegetarian food?"" or literally anything that pertains to the environment in any way. If he's wearing or doing something you have an interest in, then so much the better - you can say, ""Hey, nice shirt! I love that band"" and then start a conversation about it. If he's with friends and you're nervous about going alone, then bring a friend with you, and try to come up with some reason that you and your friend just happen to be standing near him.

During the course of this conversation, flirt with him. Look him in the eyes, laugh at his jokes, touch him on the arm, all the standard flirtatious stuff. If you're not sure how, try shadowing a more flirtatious friend for a while, or just google ""How to Flirt"" and go from there.

If he's not driving the conversation toward a date, and you don't want to just ask him out, then you have to get a little tricky. Bring up some activity that you think you'd both be interested in. Like, if he's into a band you like, and they're playing soon, mention that concert. Or if you both have a favorite actor with a movie coming out soon, mention that you haven't seen it. If he says something about how he'd like to go/see that thing, then say, ""Oh man, I'd love to do that too!"" At which point he will hopefully suggest going together, but honestly you can suggest the same thing if he doesn't. If you really want to be careful about it, then say none of your friends want to go to it and you don't want to go alone. Then ask if he wants to go with you. (EDIT: The men I know who hate being asked on dates usually don't recognize this as being asked on a date - at least, not in the way they don't like, I guess.)

The key is, at every point along the way he gets a chance to send you signals in return, if not drive the interaction forward himself. So at any point along this buildup you can drop out if he doesn't seem interested (like if he's giving one-word answers or just looks like he wants to leave). Touching a guy on the arm a few times and then stopping is MUCH less intimidating than asking someone out and being told no.

Litecoin derivatives are scrypt coins, which use the scrypt hash algorithm instead of SHA-256 like bitcoin. This makes them currently impervious to ASIC and FPGA miners because scrypt requires a lot of memory to work. In fact, scrypt was originally meant to only be CPU minable, but after the move from GPUs to ASICs in bitcoin, people figured out how to make it work on GPUs. "

I eat eggs almost every day, in one form or another. 

If I may suggest—and you may have tried this already—you need someone to lie to you. Have someone you trust and someone who knows how to cook make you a few things to eat every once in a while. Don't ask what's in it. Sometimes they'll cook with seafood, sometimes they'll cook with something else. Think of it as a blind test of your digestive system. You may find that you adore calamari or mahi mahi or even salmon when you don't know you're eating it. I've done this with a few of my friends with homemade salmon cakes to great success.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389219888.0,"You're fearing a DB but you're not IN a DB.  3x a week for a couple your age with his health and work issues - even if sometimes you go a week without - is not a huge deal, to be honest.  You're still in a fairly ""young"" relationship (even if it doesn't feel that way to you) and there's a natural decrease that happens for most people.

But it seems like you take that personally and it affects your self esteem, which leads to him feeling pressured.  Pressure kills desire - and boners! - for men.  Because pressure leads to anxiety, and he's already told you he feels he's not performing up to par.  A guy who feels that way will start to dread sex.  You have to lighten up on the pressure a bit and stop worrying so much.

If it's really just about intimacy and making out can satisfy it, as you say, then lay that on the table.  Tell him you want to take the pressure off of him, but you need to feel that intimacy.  Ask if he can commit to just making out with you every day, no expectations for anything else - and MEAN it.  Or have it be naked cuddling, or whatever, that doesn't require a ""performance"" from him.  Be happy and OK with it when that's all that happens.  

I'd bet that once the pressure is off, sex will occur more often.  Maybe not every day like you'd like, but more.  But again, you have to really be OK with just that non-sexual physical intimacy being enough so he can realize that and feel more confident expressing that with you."

Ingmundar,AskReddit,1389220155.0,"I personally don't drink alcohol because of it. I have a kind of addictive personality in a lot of respects. Every time I stop drinking caffeine, I get an incredibly painful withdrawal compared with other people. So I worry that if I indulged in alcohol, I might one day inflict the same pain I felt on others. Moderation sure - I just can imagine myself not being moderate and that being a catastrophe. 

I'm also way more indifferent to personal problems. I mean I was at home alone with my mother trying to talk her out of suicide when I was 10 years old. And at the time, I really didn't care. I was just pure pragmatic, I just wanted things to work out and tried to keep myself emotionally distant so that I wouldn't fall apart. And I did a good job to that end. I still can. I can behave like I am completely ambivalent to my own emotions. Which is good and bad. I think it more often shocks people that I can talk about my mom dying in hospital or my own suicide attempts rather matter-of-factly. 

I also don't know if this is a result of my past, but I tend to like to have dominant women in my life. My successful relationships tend to be with a take charge and confident woman. Anything else really doesn't pan out long term. 

But I mean overall I still have emotions and feelings. I still trust people. I don't care about people consuming alcohol. I just have a different way of dealing with my emotions than most. I also don't tolerate alcohol abuse and violence. I will always offer to drive people home to keep them off the roads. And I will physically stop or remove people acting aggressively under the influence of alcohol because I've seen where abuse can lead.

Also I think I throw better parties because there's always mroe to do than just drink."

I suspect that this book wouldn't gel with my politics or worldview, but I do think that accepting that a relationship is made up of two people - and as such, problems in the relationship are rarely entirely the fault of one person - is a great realization to have.

No matter your politics, one thing all women who date guys say is that confidence is sexy.  Meekness is not.  I'm not saying ""be an alpha"" or whatever redpill bullshit, but standing up for YOU and saying ""I need this"" and being invested in your own happiness is a huge aphrodisiac.

2. Wants to try before they buy. Buys the fake, eventually plops down the money for the real thing. Maybe I will like the fake SmF and find a way to save the $475 for a real Strider down the road.

3. People who cant/wont pay for the real thing but want to appear like they did. It really bugs me when people display their fake as real, especially if they are trying to sell or trade it. If you wanna say ""Hey, check out these fakes I got"" that wont bother me the slightest. 

The first group isn't really hurting the designer much, they aren't a lost sale for him because they wouldn't buy it in the first place. The second group are evaluating a possible purchase, so I feel like they also don't hurt the designer. The third group are scumbags :P"

If it's a smaller school, start by asking the professor directly if you can sit in on his class. In my experience, professors are generally very nice about it and some will even let you take the tests and give you feedback on homework.

If that doesn't work, ask the school if you can formally audit the class. This often carries a small fee (at our school it's $80), which is why I don't recommend you do so immediately."

wishforagiraffe,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1389220851.0,"i love potatoes in almost all forms and varieties (except scalloped potatoes. that is just strange) but my absolute favorite is a delicious twice baked potato. 

bake as many potatoes as you fee like dealing with for a little less time than you normally would for a regular baked potato- roughly an hour. make sure to poke holes in them. 

remove from oven, let cool slightly. cut all the way in half and scoop out the innards into a large mixing bowl, leaving about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of potato guts attached to the skin. 

in the mixing bowl, add: sauteed mushrooms and onions, cooked bacon pieces, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, green onions, sour cream, (butter if you really feel it's necessary, you're getting plenty of other fats though), plenty of pepper, some seasoning salt, garlic powder (or fresh garlic!), a small amount of cayenne pepper, and a few shakes of chipotle tabasco sauce. mix this all up well.

fill your potato skins back up with your delicious potato goo, place the skins on cookie sheets, and pop back into the oven. they're done when the tops are golden and the cheese looks melty!

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389221075.0,"It sounds like you two have really good communication skills and problem solving skills.  BUT most of the problems you've faced so far have been relatively minor - your mom's illness is a big stressor, but you both obviously wanted to help and make things work, so you weren't opposed, you were just dealing with logistics.

So in some ways the sex issue DOES seem like the first really big problem you've encountered where you're both at odds with each other, so it is telling that in that situation her first instinct is to retreat and clam up.  I think Tempts is giving good advice, but as someone who is conflict-avoidant myself and tends to clam up when a big issue is on the table, my gut is telling me that there's something big and scary (to her) that she's not telling you because she's afraid it will threaten the relationship.  

I have no idea what it is.  I'm not saying it's past trauma, or whatever, but my guess is that she is really afraid to tell you what's going on in her head around the issue for some reason.

I think this is kind of an impossible task because there are two dimensions to this.

But the more interesting discoveries stem from this: electricity, steam engines, the internet, etc. So it really comes down to how you mean ""greatest"".

I'll give a discovery just to add something to the discussion. I would argue that the germ theory of disease is among our greatest discoveries. It allowed us to greatly extend human life times and minimize suffering. Sometimes through incredibly simple behaviours like hand washing and sanitation. At the same time if opened up exploration of microorganisms which lead to a lot commercial products like alcohol, cheese, citric acid, antibiotics, etc (all of which are made en masse from microorganisms). This understanding of micro-organisms also lead to the understanding of the human microbiota (which may lead to the next great advances in immunology) and possibly even crazier treatments of disease like using retroviruses to change the DNA of an individual for the better. So in terms of benefits wrought and future potential, definitely germ theory deserves a note. "

ProtoKun7,DaystromInstitute,1389221167.0,"Damn, I was already considering a post about Riker's command abilities based on the Veridian III incident.

I think he panicked, and it was a case where Occam's Razor would have saved the Enterprise. He was so used to being in situations which require thinking outside the box that when it finally came to a situation that required a straightforward course of action, he choked.

Obviously, your ship's shields suddenly being useless is a major concern, and when Riker was confronted with that, his mind must have gone all over the place trying to think of how to solve it, when all that was needed was a good spread of weapons fire.

Specifications say that the Enterprise can fire ten torpedoes simultaneously, and we saw on stardate 43512 (as one example) how effectively weapons can be fired in rapid succession, yet the entire output the Enterprise put out at Veridian consisted of one phaser blast and one torpedo. *That's it*. If Riker had spent less time thinking outside the box and having the ship turned around, and simply ordered a full volley of photon torpedoes with phasers on full, the Enterprise could have decimated the Bird of Prey before they got another shot off.

I wonder if Riker ever admitted that to Picard.

That pattern exists independent of the actual human body (similar to a sewing pattern existing even if no instance of the clothing exists). Because of this, consciousness might occur in places and forms we would never recognize or think to look or be capable of communicating with.

lady_cardamom,AskMen,1389221652.0,"&gt;Do you think that there's even any difference from flirting and being rejected vs. asking and being rejected? I'm sure I could be wrong, but I would say there isn't. I've been rejected, and it's really not bad at all. Some people might say it's different due to the actual confrontation, but to me at least, it didn't add anything.

Yeah, I agree for sure. Whether I've made an idiot of myself around a guy for days or whether I just go up and ask -- one isn't EASIER rejection than the other. Honestly, I feel like chicks already have SO MUCH that they're responsible for to make sure they get asked out in this society (be a size 2! wear makeup! don't wear makeup! be confident! don't be homely! be nerdy! don't be too nerdy! be attractive! but don't wear the accessories guys don't like! KNOW what accessories guys don't like! don't be fat! but be confident! no really confidence! but don't be fat! be hot! be forward! don't be too forward! don't be a bitch! but if you are make sure you're hot!) that guys honestly don't have to deal with, that when all y'all have to do is pick the chick you like best, read her signals and ask her out, but now WE'RE supposed to do that TOO.. it's aggravating.

&gt;May not be the case, but if I were in your shoes and the person wasn't flirting back, I don't think I'd pursue either. I might try being a bit more forward, but if that does nothing, I'd give up.

TheDutchin,changemyview,1389222759.0,"I'd hesitate to so boldly assert that racist jokes have as much impact on their target given that so many rape victims end up with PTSD or [RTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_trauma_syndrome).

The problem isn't so much with the telling of jokes in general, than it is telling of jokes in the company of those who were victimized.  It's even a cliche that the white guy/gal is about to tell a racist joke, so quickly looks around the room for anyone who is black, finds no one so continues.  And then about four words into the joke someone who is black joins the conversation.

My point there, is that it is easy, and viewed as common decency, to avoid telling racist jokes around people who could be offended by it.  The problem is, there is no outward characteristics like skin tone with victims of rape.  You probably don't know if you're making a rape joke and there's a victim of rape who is there.

So, since (most) people tend to avoid racist jokes when there is someone who could be offended, and there is no way to know if someone could be offended with rape jokes, isn't it just easier to avoid the risk in the first place?  Just tell a different joke, I doubt anyone has so few that in the course of one conversation they run out of all other subject matter."

Can you give me some advice on the Jump program?

Here's my deal: I signed up for a new unlimited plan this past July and went with the iPhone 5, and opted into the Jump program. I currently have the option to ""jump"" to a new phone on January 26th. I am pretty unhappy with my iPhone 5 ( pretty terrible battery life and overpriced.. I screwed myself by buying the 5 right before the 5s came out.) 

How exactly does 'the jump"" work? From what I understand Tmobile will take back the phone and wipe away the remaining balance that I owe ( I paid about 130 down, and have been paying about $20 bucks a months since July.)

Truth be told, I'm honestly most interested in just buying a Moto G unlocked for $200 to use with my current contract. Does Jump let you buy the cheapest phone Tmobile sells? 

Also, will Tmobile be offering the Moto G anytime soon? It would be a hell of a PR move given that Verizon is selling the thing for fucking 99 bucks unlocked. Shit I would pay $200 for if it from you guys if it meant I could pay over 24 months. Seems like a deal like this would be right up Legere's alley( he clearly is more interested in getting people to pay for the actual tmobile unlimited plan rather than selling them expensive smart phones. And the Moto G is the tits.)  

Thanks again, and sorry for the lengthy post.

They do not believe in a Trinity, but rather that Jesus is god's son. (and not interchangeable with ""god"")

They believe only 144,000 will go to heaven.

Those who adhere very closely to the JW teachings have the hope of being resurrected after death to life on Earth, made over into a paradise.

Armageddon is coming soon. How soon? Really soon. They've predicted it's imminence since their inception in the late 19th century. When Armageddon comes, anyone not counted amongst faithful Jehovah's Witnesses will be destroyed and that's that.

No burning hell. Just death without consciousness. 

They are high control and very cult-like in that the leadership does not allow active JW's to publicly disagree with points of doctrine. If you disagree with something, and publicize that disagreement, they will excommunicate you in a process they call ""disfellowshipping"".

Disfellowshipped JW's are shunned completely and utterly by friends and family alike.

Fear of disfellowshipping keeps many who doubt, question, or just simply don't believe from actually leaving the organization.

Most biblical sins are disfellowshipping offenses, such as premarital sex and the like.

Add to that a few sins not really expressed in the bible: Don't accept blood transfusions, don't celebrate Christmas or birthdays, etc...

Additionally, even things that aren't technically ""sins"" can result in informal shunning depending on the strictness of the local congregation. Many JW's live in fear of ""stumbling"" a fellow JW if they're seen doing something most people would consider harmless - reading certain books, going to certain movies, etc..."

That being said, if you pay attention or ask more directly you may be able to discern whether she needs help or not. Do you see her eat around you? You could ask what she had for dinner/breakfast/etc. when discussing her day or something, though it isn't a sure way to determine why she's underweight. 

Asking her directly would get you the fastest answer though not necessarily the true one.

I think part of the problem is the circumstances that lead you to your current partner.  You were unsatisfied in your previous relationship, and you cheated.  As a result, I'm guessing to some degree you associate a person wanting another person with dissatisfaction in their existing relationship.

There's a ton of resources out there for identifying the root of your fears, jealousy, insecurity, etc.  Those can be useful, but some people are just monogamously oriented and aren't going to be happy in a poly situation.

anti_skub,AskMen,1389223000.0,"Dailymail, comeon bro!  And your second source, I don't see anything refuting anything?  Shows that white people (and most else) consider white people the most beautiful?  I also don't provide sources because I am coming from the angle that this is like having to pop a paper to show rocks are hard.                                                 

&gt;I'd also like to clarify that I'm not trying to say that Asian women are actually the standard of beauty but simply pointing out that saying white women are is somewhat inaccurate.              

Ahh so that is why they don't support that.  It did seem as if you were asserting that with the way you replied initially, thanks for the clarification.  I don't think its inaccurate at all btw, still haven't seen anything that says otherwise.  There is clearly more nuance to apply to it but boiled down, I think it stands pretty firm.                                                        

&gt;White women are the default setting for beauty and white people control what the beauty standard is are two separate statements.                 

Perhaps, but certainly not contradicting ones?  They are related and feed into each other.                                  

&gt;I'm not sure your Lucy Liu example is entirely accurate or at all applicable. I realize that beauty standards differ between western and Asian countries but the difference is more like women going from a 9 to an 8 than a 9 to a 4.              

I have no idea what this means, can you clear the number thing up?             

&gt;(side note: I'm not actually sure one way or another but I'd be curious to see if there was a difference between what Asians and what Asian Americans find attractive in women). Are you making the argument that Lucy Lui is considered attractive in America because she looks more white than Asian, because again that would suggest white women would always be at the top of attraction poles followed closely by other races in descending order of similarity... 

Yes, as I did so with the black women example (lighter skinned, straighter haired, mixed black women are more prevalent and considered more).                 

&gt;which would in my opinion at least put Latina's above Asians which isn't the case.                         

We aren't discussing a hierarchy below white people however, and we never were so I won't go further into that.                          
            
As far as the two separate points, if you read the previous discussion where this comes from I am just responding to assertions from the other poster (media and such) and I wasn't the one to originate the media point.

I also took some interesting classes (marine biology, russian lit (I was the only non lit major so my professor graded me very generously!), and medical policy). It was a lot of fun to experience Danish culture especially around Christmas. I cooked a lot and my house mom (I shared a flat with a bunch of American students) was surprised by my mix of south Louisiana and Indian cooking (she thought garlic was ""spicy""). My biggest problem was that I didn't really get along with my flatmates since they loved to go out and party and I was not a drinker. The danes are super friendly once you break their shell and I got to know my neighbors well. Our professors often invited us to their homes, out to restaurants, host movie nights, etc. I didn't feel any sort of ""racism"" but I think that was mostly because the danes found me to be very ""exotic"" because I was from the South and not because I was Indian (""say 'y'all' again!""
