proclivity4passivity,sex,1390149777.0,"Agreed. Maybe having a glass of wine or two (or three) beforehand would help her let go of any embarrassment or awkwardness in front of you too.

Have you tried blindfolding her? Maybe that would help narrow her focus?

Also, she probably feels so much pressure to have an orgasm with you that it's hard for her to enjoy herself because she's thinking how disappointed you'll be if she can't.... saying something to take the pressure off, like, ""I don't want you to come right now. I just want you to enjoy this,"" might help too. Or orgasm denial even? Reverse psychology?

It's encouraging that she *is* able to climax on her own AND that she's not faking it with you. Just keep the lines of communication open and let her know you're not going to give up on her."

PheonixManrod,science,1390149876.0,"From [r/depthhub](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1vi9e8/brain_imaging_experiments_have_revealed_for_the/cesss52):

You're right, in that a lot of the Schedule I status of MDMA stems from the street usage of it; or rather, the ""imminent hazard to public safety,"" to use the DEA's words.
The history is a bit complicated (and my memory a bit fuzzy), so I can only provide a brief outline, and I'd encourage those with more knowledge to clarify. The story starts in 1984, when the DEA recommended that MDMA be placed in Schedule I. After hearing two years of testimonies, the DEA judge did in fact recommend Schedule III. But something else happened in 1984 - the Controlled Substances Act was changed to give the DEA ""Emergency Scheduling Power"" for certain substances which were perceived as too destabilizing and threatening to wait for the usual review process. The DEA used this power in 1985 to place MDMA in Schedule I, because ""abuse"" was (supposedly) widespread, and because a few research papers implied that MDMA might be neurotoxic.
The hearings to make the Schedule I status of MDMA permanent continued, and at the end of them (in '86), the head judge's recommendation was for Schedule III. The DEA ignored this, and said that the current Schedule I status was fine, thank you very much.
The decision was immediately appealed, and in 1987 the Court of Appeals overturned the ruling, thereby deleting MDMA from Schedule I. The DEA's original ruling hinged on the an argument that the FDA had to declare the substance ""approved for medical purposes."" Since the FDA obviously hadn't studied or approved MDMA, then it couldn't be ""safe,"" ergo Schedule I. The Court of Appeals invalidated their FDA-approval argument, and so the DEA sat for a few months, and came up with their own list of requirements - which was essentially a carbon-copy of the FDA's list of requirements. The DEA argued that for a drug to be ""currently accepted [for] medical use,"" it had to meet their requirements, which are so stringent and require so much time and money that only big pharmaceutical companies can afford to do the research. And thus, in 1988, MDMA was again placed in Schedule I, where it remains today.
In short, the DEA stonewalled all research and discussion on MDMA, because placing a drug in Schedule I means that no research can be done on it. By constantly keeping MDMA in Schedule I, they were able to prevent any new research from coming out, and devised their requirements to be so time/money-intensive that no one could possibly overturn their scheduling."
rbaltimore,todayilearned,1390149896.0,"No, the anesthesiologist who did the epidural and then repeatedly ignored my complaints during labor that I could feel everything was the asshole. The anesthesiologist who did my c-section 36 hours later was quite disturbed by how loud I was screaming. He tried giving me other anesthetics, but because he had to be careful because my son would get exposed to them too, his options were limited and not particularly helpful. Once my son was disconnected from me, I got some version of morphine, and while I was still in pain, I wasn't screaming anymore."

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1390150455.0,"Ah, they are not subjective in my world! There is good and bad, defined by its alignment with principles of the spirit world.  Iron desires to be solid, strong, hard, and useful - not brittle, cracked, tailled, impure... When you put iron and coke to the fire, the fire and the coke is the primary interaction - either the coke joins the fire's mentality, aligns itself with self-destruction and brightness at the cost of solidity, or both are brought to iron's mentality, to which fire produces purity and force, while coke mediates the iron, so the iron can be ever stronger, ever more solid, and ever more useful, as steel.

In just the same way there are useful plants with murderous properties. They have no desire to cause death to men, who respect their spirits, only animals that kill them without thanking them (the spirits of beasts are not united to the bodies of beasts, making the divide between men and animals). Cassava and kidney beans are very poisonous when prepared incorrectly. Columbine, calabar, and corn lily will all kill you fast, but all three are powerful - and will cure your ulcers, glaucoma, and parasites, respectively, as well as anything the Imarain could buy in a city. The preparation and use of these things is low alchemy, of course, but it's indicative of the theme.

Say I want to stop a man from taking vengeance, at the behest of his lover, who is a goodly woman who respects the spirits. She would bring me all the things I asked and payment, too. An owl's feather, river-gold, a few fragrant herbs (especially bay), hemp, and tobacco. Inside a yurt, in a brazier I'd burn the hemp and tobacco mixed, wafting with the feather. The gold I'd carefully etch with a bit of bone, and that I'd cast into the coals. With my own hands, slowly, I'd need to remove it from the ash, and cast it again into the incense, in a separate bowl. The two smokes rising and intertwining, I would call the spirits to bring to purpose these things. Tobacco can inflame anger when the body feels its lack, but I could counter that with a tiny bit of psilocybin, ginger, or a dozen other herbs, things which the Imarain believe remain long in the body. A bit of animal fat would certainly not be amiss. The hemp too, will count, but it discolors the thought and weakens the mind more than tobacco clears it. Water poured into the brazier may disable the smoke, but it teaches the hemp patience and stillness, for water is patience and stillness. So even within its miasma, the mind slows to examine itself more closely. Gold is patient too, and it is the great compromiser. Its weaknesses have no bearing on the spell here, because we pour the water and ash to the second incense. Gold is often panned from rivers, so it is reunited with its deepest nature, and it serves only the purpose it desires, and its softness does not hinder it. The fire it absorbed cleansed it, too, of any baser metals whose desires might pollute the spell. And the owl is wise and thoughtful, and slow to act, and so with its feather we bring the owl-spirit, a great king in the spirit world, to preside over our parliament.

The bay we burn because good spirits delight in it and evil spirits do not. Best now to burn tallow as well to please them. Then the shaman communes with the spirit world to create this spell.

The young warrior will wake up with a head full of evil dreams, but with unnatural reticence, his anger washed away. Even if some rational desire to punish or retribute remains, the rage is gone. If the spell is done perfectly his mind will be clear, if not, it will be disordered as if hungover, and his lungs will feel shallow. The plants will not have been brought wholly to purpose, only mostly.

The spell unites the objects and defines its own spirit. Its worst qualities are base and unrelated to its will, which is to accomplish the terms of the shaman. Its best qualities are defined by, and define, the purpose of the spell. In this way, it is still more than its constituents, more than its ritual, and more than the shaman could have accomplished otherwise."

The tube must have moved, because at some point it sopped working altogether. After 40 hours of labor, with my water having been broken many hours prior, we had to get my son out and we had to do it rather quickly. Because I was not yet feeling intense contractions and I generally have a high tolerance for pain, and because we were in a hurry, nobody realized what was going to happen when they started cutting.

I'm not entirely sure why they didn't put me under general, as I was mostly just screaming and wasn't paying attention to any conversations they were having.

duggtodeath,atheism,1390151803.0,"&gt; Yes, people often cherrypick the bible and in doing so can present a false view of the meaning, or at least less than the full picture.

This is the answer I have a big problem with. I have read the Bible, and recently so. I grew up with it and still study it now. It is probably the greatest tool to use against religion because of the acts the characters take, the people their god hurts for no good reasons and the way it contradicts its own rules and promotes physical violence against children, women and non-believers. It never goes on to refute any of these things either. Beyond that, there are numerous mistranslation problems which can change the entire context of what happened. Important events like parting of the Red Sea, which scholars have said that is probably a mistranslation of Reed Sea. This is a big difference that a supposedly perfect being would not allow in his manual on life. That was a minor example, but I honestly cannot accept that the bible is just misunderstood and used wrong. That excuse is used by people who clearly have not actually read it.

&gt; I don't feel the need to explain away what you call the ""psychopathic parts."" That's a value judgment informed by your presuppositions.

That is an example of the problem. When confronted with the bible and its inexcusable actions, people just dismiss it. Hand wave the weirdness away and move on. You cannot do that with any other text. I cannot take a chemistry book, omit the formulas I disagree with and then try to make chemical bonds with only the stuff I understand. Basing ones life on the barbaric, simplistic events of the bible is just worrying. Honestly, read it, then ask yourself why anyone would believe any of it, or would base a lifestyle off it. Genesis starts the game foot the wrong foot by telling two creation stories that directly contradict each other. We also cannot dismiss the innocent people god later kills for minor things that offend him. I won't allow people to walk away from these facts. Read it.

&gt; And perfectly valid if you believe there are ""innocents"" that god has wronged.

And here is the psychopathy that book instills. You add quotes around innocents as if somehow those people deserve the death punishments their god gave to them. This tells me you haven't read it. Read it, then PM me with why those people were not at all innocent. The Bible even revels in the murder of men, women and children who did nothing wrong beside not being aware god wanted them to know he existed. Read it.

&gt; If you start with the biblical presupposition that there are actually no innocents, and that a perfect god executes perfect justice, then it reads a little differently.

See? That is you whitewashing away the deaths of people. You are a moral persons, you know the events are wrong. Yet,you have to rationalize away the deaths by supposing they all deserved it. Really Even children deserve the death penalty? For what did they do wrong to a person who created the universe? Think about that. Why is that okay? Could any number of people be killed and we rationalize their murder?

&gt; I can only see things within a horizontal, linear and time-bound perspective with a admittedly imperfect mind.

No, this is an excuse. You are making an excuse for the horrible things you've read. You know they are wrong, but you stand a lot to lose by admitting this. You know what he did was wrong. Why follow someone who is consistently wrong and keeps people in line by using fear masked as love. Remember, he wants to save us from what he will do to us if we don't let him save us.

&gt; I guess I'm not eager to sit in judgment of things I simply can't see from the perspective of a perfect, holy and infinite god.

This is problem. Religious people claim to know the mind of god and what he wants. When confronted with what he actually did and promotes, suddenly no one can understand him. Its not a mystery. narrow-minded and unimaginative and barbaric people wrote this book. There s no evidence for any of the claims made. Many of the cities and places never even existed, and that was only 2000+ years ago. We have more artifacts from much older civilizations.

&gt; But I certainly understand to difficulty you have here.

No difficulty. I haven't convinced myself that a psychopathic deity is in love with me.

&gt; I disagree that reason and faith are antithetical as you imply. If god is perfect he is also logical.

This is an illogical statement. Nothing is perfect. And even if a perfect deity existed, it would not allow its words to be mistranslated, minced, broken up, and hidden. It would care for all, love gays, treat women as equals, not abuse kids and make sure no one went hungry. That is perfection and we just do not see it.

&gt; And reason doesn't have to do with evidence per se, but how you think logically about any propositional truth.

Yes, we use reason to find evidence and answer our questions. We logic to get there too. This is now grasping at straws. You are writing poetry here, not making any sense.

&gt; There are no bare naked facts.

That is plainly false. We have facts and we build stuff with them. That mobile device you typed your reply on. That was built based on scientific facts. We tested them, and that is the proof. What has religion built. Not one aircraft, not one spaceship, it has given us no medicine, no machines, no life-saving procedures. There are facts, you do not get to dismiss them when convenient. We can prove they work, you have it in your hand. Proof.

&gt; Everything we think about goes through a grid of presuppositions and interpretation. We are subjective creatures, and our interpretations are faulty even while we do our best to be logical and consistent.

This is poetry. Are you trying to convince me, or yourself? I know its hard to give up a meme that you did not adopt by rational means. But now it makes you say stuff like this which makes no sense.

&gt; When you say religion has an illogical core, what do you mean by that?

Because religion begins with a fantastical claim and refuses to provide fantastic evidence for it. Anyone can do it. For example, I believe a dragon named Arumak invented the world. He totally did this and will punish you for not believing. See? How would this claim be any more credible? That is why we build a world based on facts, things we can test and test independently. Otherwise, anyone can make up anything at anytime and would be immune from criticism while they try to get us to integrate their stories into out life.

&gt; Thanks. I appreciate the discussion no matter the downvotes. :-)

Sure, anytime. I corrected my downvotes and removed them, I broke a Reddiquette rule. Sorry others are breaking it too :( Cheers!

3. The Federal Reserve, through Alan Greenspan's policies, held the interests rates at an extremely low level for many years throughout the development of the bubble.

Basically, you have the government mandating risky loans happen, allow the lender to be shielded from the risk through federal insurance and keep interest rates historically low, which allows the lender to profit even more from writing these risk free loans.  i don't see how this is an issue with Capitalism, rather than an issue with regulations run amok.

When it was all said and done, I didn't even poop that much from them that night, and I remember thinking it just wasn't worth it. 

As for restricting, it's a day-to-day thing. On my bad days I tend not to want to eat, but I'm definitely not restricting like I used to, and working out regularly with a trainer helps because it makes me feel as though I can eat and not feel guilty.

She's learning disabled, gullible, always falling for the wrong guy, and dependent on others to drive her everywhere because she can't pass the written driving exam. The only reason she isn't in the exact same position as your sister is that our parents have supported her through all her mistakes. They err on the side of being too strict sometimes, but overall they're very good parents. During my sister's occasional pregnancy scares, I have made it clear to her that if needed I would be willing to help her get an abortion, finance it if necessary, and help her with the aftermath. Our mom does not believe in abortion, but dad is ok with it. However, that is as far as my support will go. What I dread is the possibility that she could get pregnant, whoever the father is won't stick around, and she'll want to keep the baby anyway. If that were to happen, it would be my parents raising the child, losing their well-deserved and long-delayed retirement. Truly a nightmare scenario.

I don't have any real advice, unfortunately. All I can do is let you know that in your situation I would react exactly as you have. You do not have an obligation to enable your sister just because she's a relative. You do not have any more responsibility toward her child than to the millions of underprivileged children in this world. You've already done what you can for your siblings. You've given your sister the best advice possible, and now she has to face the consequences of her own decisions."

PlayTheBanjo,batman,1390152812.0,"Probably my favorite Batsuit from the comics was the one from [Joker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_%28graphic_novel%29).

It looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/VlLaP5h.jpg).

Batman was barely featured in the graphic novel, but it's understandable.  I mean, it *is* called ""Joker.""  As such, it was really difficult to find examples of the suit because Batman is in a total of like, 5 frames in the whole thing (it's been awhile, I forget the real number, but it was very few.  Not complaining).

As to why, I like the suit.  I hate talking about ""realism"" in comic books, but I do like that this suit appears to be the most ""real,"" with the straps on the boots and the reasonably-lengthed ears.  They are long enough that you could tell they were there, they might have even been functional (like with a radio transmitter in one or something) and they didn't look like they would get in the way (like the Arkham Asylum/City ears would have, although I do love that series).

I like [this](http://i.imgur.com/vm7Juw3.jpg) one from Jim Lee, but I think it's more to do with how much I love Jim Lee's art style as the suit itself is pretty minimalist without a lot of stuff like piping or plates or straps.  The ears are still a reasonable length.

What I *don't* like is the stuff from my least favorite artist Tim Sale.

Look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/amLCrLB.jpg).  The ears are comically long (ok I know it's a comic but still).  The cape is too drapey and loose.  I can't find any pics of it but there are scenes where the pointed ends of the cape (like how it kind of comes to several points like a bat's wings) are just curly and all over the place and him gliding with it would not have been possible.  It looks like you could break off the ears with your bare hands...

Further more, Maroni's eyes are too far apart and are on the same level as his nose.  Come on, dude.

I am by no means an artist but I really just don't like Tim Sale's style.  I get that it's his own style and a lot of people like it, but it's too abstract for me.  Like people have ridiculously far apart eye lengths and their dimensions are often fluctuating wildly between frames. 

I mean, [look at his Joker](http://i.imgur.com/zEJCCBs.jpg).  What the hell is that??  His bottom teeth are as long as the rest of his face?  I get it, the Joker is crazy and he's trying to draw him in a way that reflects that, but to me it looks like something a drunk 4th grader made. "

jtfl,changemyview,1390153153.0,"Look at if from the point of view of the other motorists.  When operating a vehicle on a public motorway, I enter into a certain social contract.  This social contract generally states that i will abide by certain rules which make the motorways more usable to everyone.  One rule is that I will drive in a safe and responsible fashion.  There is ample evidence that drunk driving greatly increases the risk of an accident and is an inherently dangerous activity.  While you might be okay with taking the additional risk for yourself to partake in activity that you enjoy, I do not. You are exposing me to additional risk through your action.  If I knew that there were no enforced drink drive laws on the books, and there was a high rate of drinking and driving on the roads, I would certainly not drive anywhere near the cities at a time between dinner and bar close.  I do not want to be exposed to that risk.  By increasing your freedom to do as you want, you end up decreasing my freedom of being able to drive on the roads safely.


The same can be said about driving the wrong way down the road.  I live in the US, and we drive on the right side of the road.  What if I say that I really enjoyed driving on the left side of the road.  I'm an excellent driver, and am very good at swerving to avoid oncoming traffic, but I accept and understand the risks involved, so I should be allowed to drive on the other side of the road.  Laws that forbid me from doing so, therefor are taking away my freedom.  Now could you imagine living in a world where there was no law that said that you drive in the right lane, and oncoming traffic drives on the left?  If there was no standard, the roads would become unusable, and everyone's freedom would be greatly diminished."

As in ""I'm being objectified because people are looking at my legs which are on display"".

Luckily, this isn't a common phenomenon in general. By and large it's limited to the most idiotic, most aggressive supporters of third wave feminist theory.

&gt;  The way billboards are meant specifically to be looked at, and serves little other function.

I don't understand how you'd come to this, unless I'm missing something myself.

But honestly, I think that's bunk. Hardly anyone's going to look at someone of the opposite sex and say, for example ""that's just a pair of legs and an ass and not attached to a person"".

Of course, if you make your primary goal to look as good as possible when you go out, then that is the main thing people will take notice of, first and foremost.

Not even a bad thing, unless you do this-- and you'll hear this from some individuals-- and then complain that people are primarily looking at you because you made a specific effort to look good in various ways, and they're not going over some detailed character assessment and mainly want to talk to you because you look good or exceptionally good."

andadobeslabs,AskReddit,1390154240.0,"&gt; Where did the idea that this is all the fault of patriarchy come from?

i think this is still remnants of 2nd wave feminism in which gender issues were very women vs men. i think a lot of people have come to redefine the ""patriarchy"" to mean a system of power in which ""masculine"" traits are better than ""feminine"" ones. i DO think that issues of gender are very different now than they once were. especially with the added axis of transgender politics. and i do think that we are moving on a progressive curve in society and that things are exponentially getting better for women every day.

&gt; Why is there such a push to completely equalize men and women? I mean, I do like to think of myself as egalitarian but men are in fact physiologically stronger than women, amongst many other distinctions that I can't recall (because I'm dumb and too lazy to look it up), so what is with this push to make them one in the same when they are not?

the idea here is not that women and men are the same, but rather that they should have the same opportunities. whether or not that be the opportunity that, if meeting fair and objective standards that are typically not obtained by women, they won't be arbitrarily changed so as to keep them out (like they were in the military, firefighting, law enforcement, etc). likewise, with the added axis of transgender people, these are getting blurred as well. people who identify as the opposite gender (or in the middle) obviously are going to have different experiences and opinions on this and i'm not going to try to make any arguments on their behalf because i just don't know.

&gt; What is your take on courts almost exclusively favoring women? How is that the fault of the patriarchy? Basically I am just curious why would the patriarchy create a stereotype that benefits this in exactly zero ways (men are bad fathers)? As well as criminal courts?

again, i think this is a misunderstanding of the concept of the patriarchy. things that make men ""good"" are simultaneously things that make them ""bad"" on different levels. because of their supposed apathy, people have a hard time feeling sympathetic towards men. especially in something as subjective as the justice system. at least that's the way i've always interpreted the data as it pertains to criminal courts. as far as in family court, i think this has a lot more to do with the idea that men don't /really/ want their kids, they just want to make the mother suffer.

ALSO, this is an outdated example, but i wrote a paper on this for my computer history/ethics class. back when women were the primary IT professionals, it was seen as women's work and they were paid damn near nothing for it. it wasn't until men started to see that it could potentially be interesting that it became a ""profitable"" industry. so there's that. not that i'm using that as a counter point, i'm just sharing an interesting relevant fact."

No, that's not how it works. You'll actually be getting LESS MPG because the bigger rims will be a bit heavier than the stock rims. Also less acceleration.

I don't know about less torque though, or how it will affect your towing. Although if you are adding extra weight to the vehicle by way of bigger wheels, then you might want to think about towing less weight and the impact that's going to have on other parts. Like the transmission and suspension."

Lluxx,actuallesbians,1390155717.0,"&gt; my mind has this evil

You know that you have to squash those thoughts already. Ex's are ex's for a reason and flirting with somebody who is taken is disrespectful - you can do better than that and find somebody new to be with, it'll just take a little bit of time. It's a very common problem to try and get people to like you (I think everybody is guilty of it from time to time, because most people want what they can't have at some point in their lives), but you're aware that it is a problem and so you can stop yourself from doing it. Be a good friend to your ex, by all means, but if you can't resist it then you'll have to limit time with her. 

As for the other girl, you need to tell her that you don't like her flirting with you because it sends you mixed messages. Tell her that she said she didn't want to lead you on and you don't want to start all that drama again. If she's a good friend, she'll respect that. "

hrtfthmttr,GirlGamers,1390155747.0,"&gt;Are you referring to Kaceytron specifically or any woman wearing a low cut shirt while streaming? Kaceytron makes an obvious point of it, but I wonder how many girls are wearing low cut shirts to get horny men to watch their stream compared to women wearing low cuts shirts because they like wearing them.

If a woman knows that showing her breasts in a gamer stream will garner more views, and titles her stream ""boobs and games"", it's fine. The point is that there is so much implicit understanding that she could get more that she doesn't even really need to externalize it herself. Unfortunately for men, women have seen the results of this activity first hand since they were children, the transfer of power by using sex is well known. It can be used to an advantage without ever being a conscious choice.

&gt;Is this being contested? I'm having difficulty understand where you're coming from because it seems like you're arguing for a fair number of things that aren't being disagreed with.

Yes, because I am advocating that we should ask about the shift in power due to the disconnect between the communication tool and the content, and determine if it's fair. In my opinion, the discussion over whether someone is acting out ""for attention"" is a veiled accusation that this disconnect is large, the shift in power is large, and the result is not fair. I think it's interesting and ok to investigate the question. Some posters here do not.

&gt;So boobs literally compel you to act differently than you want? That's not something that's part of being a man. I and many other men have no trouble passing over boobs to watch whatever I intended to watch.

Yes. I have had many instances where I had decided that sex would impact my following day sure to sleep reasons, and have been convinced otherwise by stimuli other than reasonable argumentation. Same thing with the consumption of drugs and alcohol, as well as tactics employed by panhandlers. And so have you. I'm not talking about mind control, I'm talking about the subversion of reason by co-opting known psychological weakness. You definitely understand this, as I'm sure you support age of consent laws, which are a specific example of society collectively agreeing on a clear line of acceptability for decision-making authority.

&gt;We're mind readers, as well? Unless you're speaking specifically of Kaceytron.

I'm not, as I haven't seen her stream, but for me it's part of the question. In order to make a solid case for ""attention-seeking as a pejorative"", you do need to identify the content and the communicative intent.

It may be she's just a flirty person and doesn't realise the effect it can have, or it may be that she wants the attention and enjoys knowing someone likes her. Either way, you don't want to be hurt again, so for the sake of future-you, you need to have that talk with your friend. "

If you don't understand the language of music, you can still play the piano. It would be like someone pronouncing the words of a language they don't understand. Many beginning students are like this - their understanding lags behind their pianistic abilities for a while. When a teacher does not emphasize the structure and a content of music, it's possible to produce perfectly technically capable pianists who just press the right keys at the right time and have little understanding of the music they play."

Most likely students want to know if a course if hard to balance their workload. On top of that they want to know if it's hard for a good reason.

scottious,getdisciplined,1390157267.0,"I'm a former procrastinator and I've since improved greatly and now I don't procrastinate much at all and I'm very productive.  Everybody's approach is going to be different.  Here are a list of things that I've done that I'm sure a lot of people will agree on:

1) I've changed my identity.  I slowly started identifying with the things I wanted (""I *am* a musician"", ""I am fit"").  This is a slow process.

2) I've learned to love hard work.  Yes, *learned* to love it.  It takes time too.

3) Baby steps and compassion for oneself for days when you aren't strong or you feel like you've failed.

Now the most controversial part: **I'm not a huge fan of goal setting**.  And by that I mean goals like ""I will lose 20 pounds in 3 months"" are hard to set realistically and don't take into account that things are often harder than you initially plan them to be.  Personally I don't find much joy in reaching a goal anyway.  Let's say you do set the goal to lose 20 pounds in 3 months.  Even if you do achieve that goal, you will have lost 18 pounds and probably have 2 weeks left and by then you're already used to not having that 18 pounds.  Another 2 pounds off your body won't all of a sudden make you jump for joy.  It'll be a bit anti-climactic.

My approach is to have a vision of what I want and then work to create a *lifestyle* that would realize that vision.  I ask myself every now and then if my lifestyle is indeed getting me closer to the vision.

For example, I want to be a performing solo musician.  That's the vision.  So I realize that to get there I will need a lifestyle that includes very regular practice and I need to develop solid skills in piano, guitar, and singing.  After the first 3 months, I evaluated my practice habits and I asked myself if I'm in a better position than I was 3 months ago.  Indeed I was definitely on a much much more well equipped to realize my vision than when I had started.  I then analyzed what about my lifestyle could change to better help me get there.  More practice?  Better practice?  Focus on x instead of y?  (FYI It's been a few years now and I have actually performed a bunch of times and I'm getting better every single day!)

So I keep tweaking and aiming to develop the lifestyle that will get me to where I want to be.  The vision is coming alive over time, like a sculpture being chiseled out of stone."

BlinginLike3p0,dayz,1390157631.0,"Trying to think how this could be realistic. For diesel engines it's easy. You could run it on kerosene or a lot of oils like vegetable oil or seed oils (like people do with biodesiels). Maybe you could get some oil out of a grease trap at a restaurant to just get the car a short distance. 

For a gasoline engine the fuel is a lot more restrictive you can really only run on gasoline or extremely high volatility fuels, maybe some aromatics that could be synthesized (very difficultly, not exactly a shake n bake operation). 

Propane is an interesting idea. People do retrofit gasoline engines to run on propane and even to run on both propane and gasoline, but I'm not sure how, and what kind of equipment the conversion requires. Anyway, I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility to be kludged together. 


If they ever add airplanes, then the fuels should be much more acceptable. I have heard it said by aircraft mechanics that jet turbine engines will run on almost anything once they are started. It would be fun to fill up a plane with a mix of random fuels like gasoline, kerosene, vegetable oil and alcohol and just hope for the best. "

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1390157676.0,"Atoms have what is called their nuclear binding energy.  Every element above iron has a nuclear binding energy higher than is required to hold together elements smaller than iron.  So if you break it apart, the extra energy ends up released as heat.

Now trying to do nuclear fission on iron isn't a great plan - actually it's not a great plan on most things.  The specifics of how something breaks apart and how much extra energy it has compared to what it can be split into matters a  lot.

&gt;Also could an atom be split within a random everyday object?

er... not exactly.  I mean,  yes, but not really in the way you are thinking of it.  Atom splitting is usually done with neutron bombardment, but, for example, alpha radiation is essentially a form of atom splitting, and lots of things give off alpha radiation in small amounts, and lots of things give of extremely small amounts of neutrons that could trigger fission under the right circumstances.  

Atom splitting was discovered by shooting protons (hydrogen without an electron) at lithium and splitting it into two heliums.  This is a net energy loss process, and I suppose you could probably reproduce it in a teaching lab fairly easily.  'Everyday' items depends on what exactly you mean.  

The original research from 1936-1938 on bombarding uranium with  neutrons to make barium are I believe publicly available still, and in the sense that 80 year old lab experiments are reproducable with things you can order on the internet is not unreasonable, but getting yourself uranium tends to raise alarm bells.

- The reasons [/u/daniaa](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1vlp2v/why_do_people_self_harm_i_just_dont_get_it/cethj8n) mentioned

- Any pain from a mental illness is internalized, so cutting externalizes that pain. Similarly, unlike mental illness, other people can see the scars.

- Some people tend to not feel many emotions at all when mentally ill and cutting allows them to feel something.

Ultimately, it's a coping mechanism for mental illness and most of the logic behind it is hard to follow without being familiar with the illnesses themselves."

**Season 2**

""Shockwave, Part 2"": it's nice to get closure from the season 1 cliffhanger at the very least, and the episode is actually quite fun despite being a Temporal Cold War episode. 

""Carbon Creek"": opinions on this one tend to be fairly black or white, but I come down on the side that it's one of the most fun episodes of the second season, and it's nice to see some possible character development of a certain character, along with a really nice story. 

""Cease Fire"": gotta love Shran, and in this episode he really starts to shine. Without giving too much away, this episode puts Archer right between Andoria and Vulcan, and foreshadows later developments quite well. 

""Future Tense"": sometimes nicknamed the TARDIS episode, this one is fun in that it teases quite a bit, it has seriously decent action, and manages to play with time without actually being a Temporal Cold War episode. 

""First Flight"": probably my favorite episode of the second season, this takes a look back at the NX program back on Earth prior to the construction of the NX-01 Enterprise, and provides really interesting character context for Archer and Trip. It has a real feeling of the 1950s and 1960s supersonic jet and space race feel to it, with all of the optimism about the future upon which Star Trek is based. 

""The Expanse"": this character is necessary to understand what's going on in season 3, but even without that, it's a really interesting episode. The 9/11 parallels are a bit on the nose, but the lightness of the first two seasons is suddenly cast off as humanity is forced to grow up a bit in the face of tragedy. 

**Season 3**

""Twilight"": I'm a sucker for alternate future episodes, and this one is a real doozy. It's dark, it's mature, it's serious, and it really demonstrates the stakes of the Xindi mission. 

""Simlitude"": This is a terrific ethical gray area episode which asks the question: is a clone sentient?

""Proving Ground"": This episode really moves the story forward, setting the stage for where the season is ultimately headed with the Xindi doomsday device. 

""Azati Prime"": Archer changes tactics significantly in the episode and stuff happens that I won't spoil but that are not only important, but bring additional realism and a sense of the possibility of failure to the season's mission. 

""Countdown"" and ""Zero Hour"": the intense culmination of the Xindi mission, with a hell of a cliffhanger. 

**Season 4**

""Storm Front"": Watch this only if you want to see what the hell happened at the end of ""Zero Hour"", otherwise just know that this puts the Temporal Cold War to rest. 

The Augment Arc (""Bordeland"", ""Cold Station 12"", and ""The Augments""): If you loved *Wrath of Khan*, you'll probably appreciate the three-episode arc, with a really fun cameo from a beloved Star Trek actor. 

The Kir-Shara Arc (""The Forge"", ""Awakening"", and ""Kir-Shara""): IMHO, these are the best episodes of the entire series. They delve deeply into Vulcan history, culture, and the future of the Vulcan people. This one is especially amazing if you love the Vulcans. 

The United Arc (""Babel One"", ""United"", and ""The Aenar""): This arc puts the path to where Enterprise was ultimately supposed to go in motion in a big way. Tellar, Andoria, Vulcan, and Earth all... well, I don't want to give everything away, but the name of the arc probably implies the importance. 

The Klingon Divergence Arc (""Affliction"", Divergence""): probably the best retcon I've ever seen, totally fun and worth your time. 

The Dark Mirror Arc (""In a Mirror Darkly, pt. 1 and 2): Mirror universe episodes!

The way I see it, you have a few options. You can continue as you are, being yourself, not changing anything, and learn to let it roll off you like water off the proverbial duck. You can change your style so you're less ""alternative"" and you look more mainstream, and hope for the best. Or you can keep wearing what makes you happy and learn to overcome your shyness - instead of waiting for people to approach you, start approaching them.

I'm not sure if you have many options outside of those three. Personally, I think your best course of action would be to learn to roll your eyes and ignore it when ignorant people say stupid things, and especially learn to overcome your shyness, because it's really rewarding. I've struggled with being shy since my teen years arrived. I'm afraid that I'll say something stupid, that I won't know what to say, that people will think I'm boring or lame or unintelligent, etc. And it often feels easier to not put myself out there...but the problem is, then you're alone an awful lot and not having much fun. It hasn't been easy but I've learned to take a deep breath and be brave, to take chances and introduce myself to strangers, to smile at people and say hello, to shake hands, to strike up a conversation even when I'm dying inside and would rather be a wallflower. I still have days where I shrink back, but they are fewer and more far between than ever. And as a result, I've met all kinds of interesting people and made new friends. It's hard but really, really worthwhile. 

I think you would be disappointed in yourself if you sacrificed your individuality to try and fit in...I hope you don't do that. You're a beautiful woman and there's not a damn thing wrong with the way you look, your style, any of it. Society needs what you have to offer, right down to your funky makeup and your alternative clothing.  : )  The expectations for women are stupid and arbitrary - who says you have to look like a Forever 21 billboard in order to be feminine?? There's more than one way to express yourself. Life would be so much more boring if everyone looked the same. People who aren't afraid to be different will always stand out, but in my opinion they stand out like a bright splashy flower against a field of grass - it's beautiful rather than something negative. Life's too damn short to conform.

 Another thing - people who give you crap about your looks are doing so because *they are ugly on the inside*. Have you ever noticed that people who are happy with themselves don't treat other people that way? The people who hate on you are doing it because, deep down, they're miserable with themselves. Pity them, but don't take their hatred to heart. All the crap they're saying is a lie anyway.

&gt;the fact that my friend keeps bringing it up as the funniest thing that's ever happened to her while joking about my manliness is just making it worse

:(   If you have told your friend how hurtful this is, and that you've had all kinds of teasing in the past regarding your femininity, and she *still* does this, it's time to get a new friend, because that would be seriously crappy. Otherwise, if she doesn't know how you feel or about your past bullying experiences, she may be one of those oblivious people who figured that, since you laughed it off, you really didn't mind. You should talk to her.

&gt; I just want to be petite and ""cute"" by people's standards 

I dunno, being little and cute has its downside as well, from what I hear from petite ladies. You're never going to be a small woman...just like I am never going to be a voluptuous hourglass-figured pinup girl with big perky boobs and smooth, glossy hair. If you can learn to accept the things you are not, and can't be, and embrace who and what you *are*, if you can learn to see that they're just as good as what you yearn for, girl, you'll be so much happier! It's almost like you have to detox your brain...we get bombarded with the message that you have to look a certain way, and that if you don't, those body parts are ""flawed"", but that's not true. Being tall isn't a flaw. Having small boobs like mine isn't a flaw.  ; )   I think that's the best place to start - learning to see your body as good instead of bad.

&gt;I'm so sick of feeling like this but I can't keep kidding myself and thinking I look good when I go out while stuff like this happens so regularly.

Did you ever consider the fact that maybe the problem is not your appearance - maybe it's just that the people around you are closed-minded and nosy? I'm serious.

&gt;You, and everyone else in this thread, is misunderstanding Orochimaru so badly.Orochimaru wasn't primarily trying to achieve immortality. He had at least half a dozen means of achieving something so petty. For example, he was Sasori's partner and no doubt knew the theory behind human puppetry. And I seriously doubt Kakuzu's jutsu (which wasn't an immortality jutsu....even Kakuzu denied it. It's just a fancy was of replacing internal organs, and probably doesn't work on the brain, i.e. Kakuzu was perfectly mortal) or Hidan's religion escaped his notice. Orochimaru guaranteed his immortality using the curse seals, which appear to be a horcrux equivalent, and he could have possibly used Edo Tensei on himself...speaking of which, if Oro was revived in Edo Tensei and then transferred his spirit to a living body, would he still count as dead?Orochimaru was trying to create and inhabit the perfect body. Everything else hes done in the series has merely been leading up to that. WHY did he want Sasuke so badly, given that Sasuke's body was going to give out after three years like all the rest of his bodies?....note Orochimaru's experiments with Hashirama and Edo Tensei.Orochimaru was trying to achieve the Rinnegan. He has been all along. He wanted Sasuke in order to get a pair of high-potential Sharingan, and he no doubt would have used Sasuke's body as the basis of many more Uchiha bodies, possibly clones of Sasuke, possibly genetic children, and altered these bodies one after another with Hashirama DNA until he achieved the Rinnegan - which he would have then transplanted into one hybrid Uchiha-Senju body after another for the rest of eternity.I would bet damn good money that the only reason Orochimaru joined Akatsuki in the first place was to investigate Pain's Rinnegan. Who knows...perhaps this was the origin of his interest in the Sharingan? Who knows how long Orochimaru has known of the Rinnegan...for all we know Jiraiya told him about Nagato's - which may be the very reason he joined Akatsuki."

We are all human, we are not perfect and we all make mistakes. You will be a lot more happy if you accept that and just make the best of it.

At 19 y this is very normal. No girl will ever date you out of pity of gratitude. You will have to sell yourself. 

I think you can compare finding love with finding a good job:

Having rich parents with connections (or having the looks) sure helps a lot but that's not everything. Being a hard-worker (or confident with girls) might be a even bigger help.

You might be the greatest guy in the world but if the girls don't know it or do not see what advantage you could be for them they will not date you.

...*chicken?*"
Daiteach,studyroomf,1390159463.0,"Shirley has always been the character that they've had the hardest time figuring out what to do with. Dan Harmon has said as much. I do feel like the show has the hardest time getting into her head, or perhaps second-hardest, after pierce.

One thing that I see in Shirley is the same thing that's reflected in a lot of religious characters on television, which is that the effect that her faith has on her views, her decisions, and the things she says kind of jumps all over the place, and the show's own angle on the character's fatih sort of does as well. Where most of the characters are sketched in a reasonably nuanced fashion, Shirley's characterization seems like is often just exists as a vague Christian-shaped blob that writers project their own issues onto. If Abed mentioned off-handedly that he thinks Batman is a bit overrated, that'd be regarded as a significant continuity error. Shirley on the other hand, can jump all over the place in terms of how she feels about gay people and it's just sort of whatever. Shirley spends some fraction of the show being vaguely respected in the abstract, some fraction of the show being actually drawn in some detail, and some fraction of the show being little more than a strawman. In Cooperative Polygraphy, her most ""shocking"" crime against the rest of the study group is little more than a minority political belief. It's not expressed in a particularly heinous or unexpected way, like, say, drugging or chipping the rest of the group without their knowledge. It's just allowed to be a joke on its own. The issue isn't that Shirley's convictions are on the table in terms of things to joke about; they absolutely should be. The issue is that a lot of times the convictions just sort of *are* the joke. That's a perfectly reasonable way to write a character, and lots of funny Christian characters are written using exactly that strategy, but it's hard to have that while also trying to have the character be taken seriously.

The show does sometimes take the stance that the character is basically a good person *despite* her faith, with the show celebrating her hardest when parts of her that are *at odds* with that come forward. Other times, though, she's basically just strawman Christian. One of the tricky parts about thinking about the character's progression is that the show doesn't seem to have much of a sense of where the character is to begin with. Is she straight-up evil? Does her faith make her a better person? A worse person? Does she deserve some kind of comeuppance? Does she think she needs to change? Does the character think she has everything all figured out? (I'd argue on the last one that she doesn't think she has it all figured out to a greater degree than many of the other characters, but the ways in which she does think she has things figured out are further from what the *show* thinks of as having things figured out, and the audience as well.)

In short, possibly because they're labels that are less well-represented in the life experiences of the creators, Shirley has had a hard time transcending being a bunch of low-resolution labels into becoming a coherent character. Her status as a mother and a married woman/divorcee hardly informs the character at all, except as the former is occasionally used as a plot device to put the character under time pressure and the latter is used to drop plot bombs once in a while to give the character something to do. The show couldn't possibly care less about Shirley and Andre's relationship except when there's some big shift in it; we get updates on it maybe once a season. Her faith is amorphous, an excuse to have her say just whatever. She's usually a hypocrite, but the nature of her hypocrisy varies wildly. Very few stories are told even partially from her perspective, even the ones that are about her. 

On a not-so-related not, I think that part of the reason that the starkly negative characterization that the show sometimes uses bothers me is that it's not clear why she and the study group would want to hang out together. If she's unbearable to them and she doesn't approve of them, why haven't they grown apart? Rather than try to show why they're still friends with her despite the passive-aggression and the differing worldviews, half of the time the show just randomly drives other wedges between them. In Remedial Chaos Theory, the group decides that they need to bully her out of giving them baked goods, and *this is presented as the reasonable position.*

Some of my views on the character may stem from the fact that I personally have relatively little in common with the character, so it's possible that I relate less to her even where the show is presenting from her viewpoint."

Leprosy studies have been done using armadillos - the only other mammal that naturally contracts the disease - and now we've greatly reduced the amount of leprosy that occurs in wild armadillos. 

I mean, there's options for reducing things where we can (Like how nowadays the VAST majority of cheese is produced from rennet made with genetically modified bacteria that produce ""pure"" rennet that actually makes the cheese taste better than calf rennet). 

I very much support animal welfare, especially as a zoologist with a focus on conservation, but I think animal rights are just a bit too radical for me.

PlayTheBanjo,science,1390159590.0,"&gt;What's the best way to get rid of a hangover, drink more.

As a person who has suffered countless hangovers and will likely suffer countless more, I must respectfully disagree.

I find getting rehydrated comes first and foremost.

Secondly, if I have the presence of mind about it the night before, I'll cut up some strawberries and bananas and put them in the fridge in a container.  Next morning, dump them into a blender with some vanilla Greek yogurt and banana-strawberry juice (v8 v fusion is what I use) and blend that up to get some nutrients back in you and also get something somewhat easy to digest in your stomach.  Flax seeds optional, but a plus.

Third, also make some coffee.  Drink it, it'll wake you up plus make you have to use the restroom which will help.

Then, take a shower/bath and brush your teeth.  Everything feels better when you're clean.

Also, if possible, sleep through the day.  Preferably with an ice pack on your head in a darkened room.

Lastly, and this one is weird, but I find the greatest cure is running 3+ miles.  It's hard to get motivated to do it but once you get going, you feel perfectly normal."

She came a few hours before I was discharged. I told her I wasn't having problems, she checked my latch, and went off immediately to go care for someone else.

I'm pretty sure that you also don't have to wait for them to come to you. Call the nurses station and tell them it's important because you're having trouble/pain/whatever, and they'd push someone like me who hadn't complained of nursing issues back for someone who called to ask for help.

So, if you can't afford your own LC, don't be shy, just ask! Tell them it's an issue. They'll assume you're a lower priority if you don't tell them you're having trouble."

Renner1,OneY,1390159812.0,"&gt; I get the impression you're not exactly open to these kinds of ideas

Yes, because the ""I'm a victim of thought-rape because people look at my body when I show parts of it off"" isn't at all a sound idea.

That way of thinking-- and pretty tame compared to some of the other things that some of these sorts come up with-- isn't worthy of my respect as a rational process or of my ear.

I should state that it is always important to stress that this particularly rabid third wave feminist logic, as with the even-worse second wave before it, is largely fringe bullshit.

Third wave idiocy has permeated certain circles to a larger degree, for the most part because of the immense double standard in terms of the behaviour of the sexes it allows, amongst other things-- but still fairly uncommon when it comes down to it.

&gt; It's always easier to dismiss people as idiots rather than empathize even momentarily, but I'd hope that maybe next time you try approaching from a position other than condescending dismissal.

As I said, there's virtually nothing to emphasize with. Nothing based in reality, I mean. Rejecting this sort of bullshit, I should add, is not a de facto endorsement of the sort of person who'd act in an overtly crude or simply disgusting manner whenever they saw something they liked-- not that it's usual or socially acceptable to have some slovenly ass shouting sexual innuendo or making obscene gestures at people walking down the street.

But no, claims of ""sexism"" or ""objectification"" or the ""male gaze"" from people who consciously dress in a way that displays, sometimes in excess, their bodies and physical assets are quite baseless in all but the most egregious examples and for the most part are worth nothing but condescending dismissal.

Willravel,DebateAnAtheist,1390159963.0,"I'm reminded of Doctor Manhattan from *The Watchmen*, a being which accidentally gained god-like abilities and who actually goes through a relatively realistic personal crisis of identity and perception as he comes to terms with the transformation. Slowly but surely, his connections which were left over from being human became thinner and thinner, as he began to comprehend non-linear time and lived with the perception of both cause and effect simultaneously and realized he could both understand and bend matter and energy to his will, albeit without violating the laws of the universe. 

What we see in the fictional account of Alan Moore is that this is one of several routes to what we consider nihilism. With a newfound outside perspective, Manhattan recognizes that there are deeply contradictory aspects to the human condition which he no longer feels within himself. He doesn't fear death. He regards human life with value, but not in the same way you or I might, as equals. He eventually leaves humanity completely, likely to never return, because why would he care about humanity? Even as a former human himself, because he's so far beyond our concerns, he realizes that his interest in humans is just a vestige, one which has disappeared as he grew into godhood. At the end, he leaves Earth, possibly never to return, with the idea that he might create life one day, sort of as a passing curiosity. 

There are affairs in the universe which are simply more interesting than a few barely-sentient beings on a particular planet in a particular system in a particular galaxy at a particular time. 

If I were to design a god, it would probably be like Doctor Manhattan. He or she or it would be an accident, they would slowly come to terms with being god, they would slowly disconnect from the small affairs of their civilization, and they would live simply as one who watches and experiments on their own. This individual would have basically no interest in any individual sentients, and would probably not care about even highly advanced galactic civilizations. They might regard even the most advanced life in the universe with the same interest we have in a television program, a distraction which entertains us at the moment, but which we could never see again and not really care about because other things can capture our interest. 

I'd be skeptical of a deity which took an interest in small affairs, because such a deity might be prone to the drawbacks of our smallness. A god that cared about individual groups' moral codes might be tempted to live by those small codes at the cost of others. A god that cared about individual groups's survival might be tempted to ensure their survival, at the cost of others. And a god that required worship under the threat of eternal torture would be the worst being imaginable, like a toddler with a magnifying glass that's found an ant hill. "

daisyismydog,Indiemakeupandmore,1390159984.0,"All right, I tried applying it wet. The results were rather appalling to be honest and I definitely do not recommend doing that. If you're going for a more dewy finish with Meow's Purrfect Puss you might be able to use a setting spray to achieve that but the way to go is *not* applying it wet. I don't have a setting spray on hand or else I'd try that for you, sorry! 

Here's a more detailed breakdown of my test today:  

* **Applied dry:** I like to moisturize with either CeraVe cream or rose hip seed oil before using powder foundations because I have dehydrated skin. Then, to apply it dry (as I normally do) I use a flat top kabuki brush and sweep it across my face. I try not to buff too much as that can bring up dry flakes. I find that the finish it gives is matte, but still very close to how my skin looks normally and I feel like this foundation really sinks in. I did this on half of my face.   
* **Applied with a dampened flat top kabuki:** I wet the same flat top brush I used to apply it dry and then used a paper towel to squeeze the water out. This isn't the same method used in the blog post and I didn't use the RT expert face brush so you might take that into consideration. Using my dampened brush, I picked up some of the powder and proceeded to try to apply it. This was really quite horrendous and it wouldn't sink into my skin and it looked like someone smeared a thin layer of cake batter onto my face. I tried to buff it in as much as I could, but that just brought up a ridiculous amount of dry flakes (to be fair, I'm prone to those so it may not be entirely the application method) and still had the cake batter look. 
* **Applied with a beauty blender:** At this point, I wasn't going to go around with a half-cake batter face (recall, one half of my face had been applied dry and looked nice) so I removed the half that had been applied wet with the flat top kabuki. I went back to read the blog post and it mentioned you could also use a sponge so I wet my beauty blender, squeezed the water out, and put it in a paper towel to squeeze more water out (how I normally use it for liquid foundation). Then I used the pointy side to pick up some foundation and stipple it on. This wasn't so bad, but the coverage it gave was very sheer. Generally my experience with the beauty blender is that it applies foundation a bit sheerer than normal, but I found it more difficult to layer coverage and at best with a wet BB could only achieve light coverage. Applied dry with the flat top kabuki I can achieve medium coverage so while this doesn't look horrendous I don't think it's the best method to use this foundation.  

I have dehydrated skin so the results might be a bit different if you have oilier skin or even normal. I still think Meow's Purrfect Puss foundation is fantastic and would recommend it, but not if you expect to get two different finishes from it by applying it wet vs. dry.

twelvis,AskMen,1390160214.0,"Here's what's working for me:

Keep messages short. One witty sentence/question related to her profile, plus a catchy sort of funny question that will prompt an answer if she has any sense of humor. Challenge her, don't suck up to her (e.g., ""I love that think you like!""). Spend no more than 2-3 minutes looking at a profile and writing a message. Ignore people who say you need a well-thought out long message; the reality is two-thirds of your messages will likely never be even read--they'll just be buried among dozens of others she hasn't bothered to read. All you want is to pique her interest.

Change your profile. Don't list every little thing you like. Describe yourself. Keep it short. No one reads this crap anyway.

For every 100 messages I send out, I get ~33 views, ~10 responses, and ~2-5 dates. 100 messages x 2 minutes = ~3.5 hours spread over ~10-14 days. Not bad.

Or you can spend 20 minutes writing 10 thoughtful messages, likely getting no responses.

That being said. It's still easier to approach women IRL."

Are you kidding me? I was pretty sure being an Attachment Parent was about making the best choices for your child (just like all parenting) only doing it in a very close-to-the-hip kind of way. And if choosing formula is the best choice, good on you for making it.

The teams thing is just a way for moms-to-be to bond over stuff online, so we can ask other parents-to-be of girls/boys/unknown for help, advice, and information on sales. ;)

She needs to realize that nobody really gives a butt one way or the other about how you parent. The Mommy Wars (that I've only ever heard about from people complaining about them) nonsense is basically a bunch of people defending their choices. Nobody really gives a quarter of a damn about whether you wear your kid or use a stroller, they just don't want to feel bad for whatever it is they're doing.

And guess what she just did? She joined the Mommy Wars as a new figure to rally around for people who are like her to go, ""OMG, I know!!!"" Without even meaning to, she started her own team with this post. She started team ""I think I fall short, even though I try really hard and I'm a pretty good mom even when I don't meet my own unrealistic expectations.""

MidnightSlinks,AskWomen,1390161121.0,"1) You just lecture a dietitian with a background in sports nutrition.

2) You absolutely can lose fat while building muscle. If you eat at maintenance (which actually means to eat more if you're adding in exercise) with high protein (1.4-1.6 g/kg/day) and you lift weights several times per week, your body will use energy from stored fat to synthesize your excess dietary protein into new muscle. Weight may easily remain the same (definition of eating maintenance calories) and you will gain muscle definition as subcutaneous fat is decreased and muscle hypertrophy occurs.

3) The average woman requires far less than 2000 kcal/day to maintain weight if she is sedentary (AF=1). From Ireton-Jones, Harris-Benedict, Mifflin-St. Jeor, and the 2002 DRI you get 2120, 1520, 1450 and 2010 kcal/day, respectively for a 5'5"", 165# woman (the average US woman). Average=1775 kcal/day. If we're talking a woman with a BMI of 23 instead of 27 that'd be 1610 kcal/day for maintenance if sedentary.

4) The more muscle you have the less a percent decrease in calories 500 kcal is. Going from 1700 kcal/day to 1200 kcal/day means dropping out 30% of your entire daily intake--that's a whole meal. If you're a guy who is lifting weights every day and maintenance is 2500 kcal for you, a 500 kcal/day deficit is only 20%. From my experience working with people losing weight, the mental anguish is a hybrid of the number of calories cut and the percent cut. So if a tall person an a short person, both equally obese, cut equal calories, the short person would feel it more, but if they cut an equal percentage, the tall person would feel it more."

So I'm not going to ask my attachment parenting mommy friends for support over the choice to formula feed.  Does that mean they have no value?  No, I'm going rave about it while I put my feet up with a couple of the working mommies while we drink wine and sit our kids infront of the tv so we can blow off some steam.  

I do my best to speak out when I fall short.  I'm a terrible stay at home mom, reactions to admitting it range from shocked horror to happy relief.  Isn't it better just to share our experiences?  To really join the team and share our experiences good and bad?  Better than just quitting and leaving our other mommy friends believing they're the only ones that don't quite live up to the parenting manual?  I'm a great mom, but a shitty stay at home parent.  Judge me if you dare!

I don't know, I guess I empathize with the feelings but I feel like the only way she's really letting anyone down is by choosing not to engage.

If it's anything less than a few years, we're invaded overnight. We have to mount an insurgency against the troops they station on the ground and it takes decades. 

If, however, we have 10 years to prepare, I suspect we could come up with rudimentary energy-based weapons. We already have things like the Active Denial System being used in our internal conflicts. Scale something like that up enough, and there's the potential to do significant damage. Imagine we create an array of directed microwave emitters and hook them directly up to power plants capable of supplying them with a great deal of electricity. Standard deflector shields, I believe, are primarily designed to deal with particle and ray weapons, but I suspect that microwave weaponry could be rare enough that it might not be something they're prepared for, especially if they're particularly powerful. As impressive as the power output of a star destroyer undoubtedly is, we have the benefit of being an entire planet, where we can build dozens of power plants to supply a great deal of power. "

In short, int is knowing tomatoes are fruit, wisdom is not putting them in a fruit salad, and cha is the ability to sell a tomato-based fruit salad.

You don't say much, and often aren't very well-spoken, but you're wise, even though nobody ever listens to you.

To be honest, these sorts of min-maxed stats are what I really hate because they make characters who often don't make sense. Wisdom is inexorably tied to intelligence - you wouldn't have a low score like an 8. It would be better with a slightly higher score like a 10. That's average. It doesn't really make sense to have a dumb character who's also wise.

Edit: This isn't necessarily true. I would need to know all ability scores and your class to give you an accurate portrayal of your character.

Edit edit: I really need to learn to read.

For an unarmed swordsage: You're quick, strong and hardy, and you know a lot more about life than most. You were never bright, and you're definitely not well-spoken. You're crass, uneducated and you don't know much in the way of knowledge, but you can throw a punch and you certainly know people."

And evasion of taxes *does* harm those who follow the law and pay taxes. If only one person followed the law and everyone else evaded, that one person is directly hurt by everyone who evades.

Kage the Warrior, grizzled veteran of the space animal wars, looked around at the remains of the resistance. Scar sat quietly, tinkering with his robotic knee which was implanted after Hax's betrayal.

He pointed at the map, indicating the left side of Final Destination. ""They're holding Hungrybox here, in the infinite shine cell."" Everyone nodded grimly. After Armada's retirement, the Foxes launched an assault to capture half of the stage and quickly converted it into a fortress full of reflectors and laser defenses, and the infinite shine cell at its heart was known to break the sanity of even the most iron-willed.

Axe piped up from one end of the table. ""What of the mercenary Mew2king? Could he make a rescue attempt?""

The commander of the small regiment of Marth mains at the vanguard, PewPewU, shook his head. ""He can't be trusted. And I heard he was busy working on some new technology right now anyway.""

MacD agreed. ""We can't wait for the Metaknight to be completed. Ice could take one or two Sheiks but there's no certainty we could save him.""

As an argument broke out over how difficult that would be, Kage sighed and looked around. The majority of the low-tier mains, including all of the Links and Donkey Kongs, had been killed or captured long ago in a fierce shine-spike blitz. Others like Hax had converted to Fox. Taj, the lone Mewtwo, held up a hand for silence. ""Two are coming.""

The door suddenly burst open as a mighty fist pounded upon it. Loki walked into the room, carrying Vectorman over his shoulder. Shroomed jumped up from his seat to look after the wounded Yoshi, while Kage turned to his apprentice. ""You were supposed to be in Japan, why did you return?""

Loki smiled.  ""I’ve returned with hope. I went searching for Vectorman to be a mentor to him.""

""What hope can we have,"" Kage growled, ""when everything is as bleak as this?""

Vectorman’s voice, though weak, carried through the room. ""The Red Yoshi, he is called. aMSa…"""

As a woman, I can kinda feel your pain, except for me it's more like I get jealous of my girlfriends who seem to always be in great relationships. I used to really let it get to me, but then I realized how ugly jealousy can make a person, and how little jealousy actually does to better *my* life. It only makes my life worse. Plus, things are often not what they seem. Who knows what's going on in your friend's life behind the scenes, that she doesn't tell you about.

They still got to vote ""no"", didn't they? I don't think they deserved the right to express themselves, not after how some of them have been behaving.

&gt; the issue is that we are now back at square 1 - No democracy and the verge of a dictatorship, something (in my own opinion) not even Morsi would have dreamed of doing.

You realize that there were some who attached themselves to the MB camp who had no love for democracy as it is, who sided with the MB because it was the ""least bad"" option and at least wasn't openly hostile to the super conservative in terms of Islamism.

Personally, I'm not a fan of complete democracy because I think there are some ideologies and ways of thinking that shouldn't be allowed to be in public society.

The very conservative Islamists, for example-- until they realize that the majority of the population is overtly hostile to Egypt turning into some Salafi/takfiri theocratic state, their democratic rights should be put on the backburner. They don't get to say ""if we participate in democracy then our narrow puritanical view has to prevail"".

I am not a fan of 'forcing' people to do things in relationships, but sometimes that's the option you're left with. It's nonsense to pretend that you don't need outside help when you're unhappy for years. You should start counseling on your own and let your husband know that his attendance *necessary* for your marriage to continue. 

You have boundaries within marriages just as you have in any other relationship. It's okay to say, ""This is necessary for me, and vicariously you. It's not acceptable for none of my intimacy needs to be met in a marriage."" It sucks to give your partner an ultimatum, and you may not be ready. I think counseling on your own will give you a plan of action that fits your situation. 

Note: Communication is not always verbal. You can talk til you're blue in the face and the person across the table will not have received the message. 


Meanwhile, find some emotional support through friends and family. Just because you are married doesn't mean you have to depend on one person alone. "

Expecting police to help you is a valid expectation. When they don't, they are bad cops. The letter of the law is just there to protect the police. Ideally it would be if for example a cop was chasing a criminal and across the street a little old woman falls and breaks her hip. The cop isn't going to be punished for not stopping his chase to help the old woman.

An acquaintance of mine said this to me some days ago that I didn't really know how to react to. Paraphrased for translation:

""What the fuck is it with you and always looking for the weakest and most scrawny person in the crowd? Why is it that you feel such a need to find a way to relate to the least useful person in the fucking building?""

It was phrased like it was a bad thing, but the tone was a lot friendlier than the words would suggest. At the time I just answered something along the lines of ""Well, I guess I just kind of want to understand the people around me"" or some similar deflection, but the situation kind of stuck with me because I truly didn't understand what the hell he was actually getting at.

Now I suddenly have a very positive perspective on it. No idea if that's the way he meant it, but what felt to me like a shortcoming or a mistake suddenly seems a bit more positive. That's a very welcome feeling today. Thank you :)"

Daiteach,studyroomf,1390163867.0,"&gt;  I came to the conclusion that Shirley's main reason for hanging out with the others is due to her loneliness. She's a very isolated character (we see that frequently when offered a glimpse at her background/personal life) and she often laments moments of exclusion that she is subject to within the group (though not to the extent that Pierce did).
&gt; Part of the point to Community is that these folk are broken people, and a large factor in their group dynamic is simply the fact that they don't have many other options, so I'm not really making a 'new' observation. I do however think that the way in which Shirly arrived at this place of loneliness and isolation is definitely one of the more interesting routes taken when compared to the other characters.

That's a good point. I think it's easy to overlook because it's a standard sitcom convention to conserve detail and focus the show by drawing pretty sharp lines between ""the group"" and ""not the group"", even where it's implied that the characters have other connections. The cast of *Friends*, for instance, is seldom shown spending any time with people outside the main cast, but they have no trouble finding ""other friends"" to set each other up with, and when they are shown in unusual settings, like their workplaces, they often have congenial social relationships with the people there. Similarly, Jeff presumably has an unending series of off-screen relationships that aren't shown and aren't even mentioned except as a group, to establish that Jeff is a bit of a dog in that regard. Friends outside the study groups are introduced on an as-needed basis.

I think that the overall effect is that it's harder to get a read on how busy the characters' outside lives are, because you've got your sitcom filters up when you're watching it. The show does make references to loneliness, though, and in Shirley's case there's several reasons that you might expect her to be more disconnected. (People often leave divorces with fewer friends than they had before.)"

No.  The law in question (22USC §8422 (b)(3))  requires that the US cut off aid whenever a government is replaced by a coup - which Mubarak was, in 2011.  The State Department got around it in 2011 (as they did in 2013) by determining that they did not need to make a determination as to whether a coup had occurred."
peacefinder,AskHistory,1390163914.0,"It's  difficult question, because some US involvement was essentially inevitable. 

Japan decided to seize the southwest Pacific to secure the resources it needed. The US had a substantial navy and bases across the Pacific, which represented a threat to this plan. The sort of military planners who put together operations to seize a large part of the planet tend to dislike leaving large threats unchecked. 

In both the Atlantic and the Pacific, US merchant shipping would have occasionally been mistakenly destroyed by the Axis combatants. (Especially so in the Atlantic, as Canada would have been running freight to Great Britain over the same seaways.) Since one of the US Navy's founding missions is to protect US merchant shipping, it would be very unlikely to stand idly by. 

Perhaps a more interesting question would be what would have happened had the US joined the Axis..."

Putin is not some guy off the street, nor is he some beatnik civilian that can make legislative proposals but knows nothing about real life security. He was an KGB agent once, for crying out loud. He is not the best guy to look up to in terms of, say, freedom of speech, but in terms of security, he just may be *the* head of state that I'd want to oversee these activities. The Olympics are to be his pride and joy, his personal pet project that terrifies even the highest echelons of management and gives them cold sweats if there is *any* possibility of error (I have a family friend/lawyer that is involved in the project management, so that bit is from his words and is thus hearsay, but I've got a hunch he's right). And despite corruption reaching astronomical levels, I have faith in security. Putin would much rather have a few billion dollars ""mysteriously disappear"" than have a single terrorist rain on his parade and upset the party, even if it means bringing the entire city of Sochi under strict military curfew. Yes, domestic terrorists are incredibly hard for *anyone* to trace and neutralize, but Putin knows the enemy very well (as he's dealt with them for over a decade), is willing to throw unlimited resources to keep things secure, and will use any means necessary to ensure that the whole event goes without a hitch. The terrorists might still slip in a nasty surprise or two, but Putin is going to give them a run for their money, at the very least.

Personally, I'd be much more worried about cities in the surrounding states and areas. While Sochi may be on full lockdown, such security would be unfeasible for every city, even for Putin, and the terrorists have shown that such cities, like Volgograd, are fair game. I have family and many friends in Rostov-on-Don (a bit larger than Volgograd and a bit closer to Sochi) and Krasnodar (a bit smaller than Volgograd but very close to Sochi). I hope they take utmost precautions and avoid public places when possible during the Games. Volgodonsk, a mid-size city between Rostov and Volgograd, already had a highrise building blown up by the terrorists ten years ago.

Here's hoping that, God willing, everything will go smoothly."

I've had people (including one of my former elders) try to explain to me that scientists are wrong a lot, too, so science doesn't necessarily trump faith.

Sure, ""science"" gets some things wrong... but what does that really mean? Science is simply a group of ideas and hypotheses that have been tested by many different people to test their validity. Science is a mindset that *anyone* can have, you don't need a lab coat or a degree on your wall to do science. A five year old looking at ants carrying leaves across a path and wondering what they're doing with them and how the know how to get back home? Science. Pondering why some cliffs are all striped and layered? Science.

Science isn't this big, awkward encyclopedia that sets out to destroy religion and tradition. Sure, there are institutions that practice science that are big and - at times - flat out wrong.

OccupyJumpStreet,circlebroke,1390164672.0,"&gt;To be fair, if the person doesn't make enough with tipping to equate minimum wage, then the employer has to make up the difference.

Three things about this:

1) It averages out per week, not per shift. Let's say I make $120 in wages + tips in 6hr shift 1 and $24 in wages tips on 6 hour shift 2 in the same week. I made $20 an hour shift 1, and $4 an hour shift 2, but because I averaged $12/hr over my week it doesn't matter.

2) Good luck keeping your job after enforcing that right. I'd bet any amount of money you would either be fired or constructively dismissed (only being given a small amount of hours, deliberately put on non-busy shifts).

3) Remember that waitstaff are expected to tip out the busboys, food runners, etc. So a non-tipping table literally takes money out of their pockets."

This post isn't talking about the governmental systems, it's talking about national pride, and seeing your state, province or county as a nation. By doing this, you equate your state/province/county with other nations: you're saying that Missouri or Rhode Island is as important and relevant as Portugal, and whilst that may be true within your own nation, this is the *world wide* web, and most every other country in the world is nation first, state/province/county second, if at all.

cam94509,ainbow,1390166028.0,"&gt; You have no evidence to support your second; the girl's version of events do not mention that, even though it would be to her benefit.

It's NEVER possible to remove yourself from this kind of situation inside a school. Like, NEVER EVER EVER. You've clearly never faced this if you believe otherwise, honestly.

&gt;You have one vague statement - from a teenage girl trying to talk her way out of trouble - that might partially support your first statement. I think it's improbable that every authority figure available to her is utterly indifferent to incessant bullying.

I'm pretty fucking sure we have solid documentation that she went to like, the school superintendent or some shit (edit: I hadn't read this particular article, and was working off what I remembered from previous articles. This isn't as well documented as I believed, and it wasn't the school superintendent, but it's not hard to believe, especially given that it's exactly how harassment functions.), and reported harassment. Not every authority figure needs to be indifferent, the ones who aren't merely need to feel as if they had no authoirty. 

&gt; Stewing about an incident for several days and then slapping someone over it is an ""anger problem""

On the other hand, that's not at all what happened. Having an incident occur and then facing further bullying isn't slapping someone over *that incident*, it's slapping someone over *the current bullying* which would hardly be an overreaction even without the prior incident, and is even less an overreaction in the context of the incident.

I remember afterwards walking somewhere and mulling it over in my mind, and becoming really excited about this website I'd found where I could engage and debate people around the world, understand different cultures, challenge and be challenged, change opinions and have my own opinions changed.

But instead what happens (and I'm guilty of this too) is people come to this website with their opinions set in stone, even if they aren't anywhere near fully formed or cohesive, and nothing you can do will get them to even consider being wrong. I first noticed this with big things, like gun control or economic opinions; people not only wouldn't budge, but would actively protect their view no matter how much evidence was stacked against them.

But then I realised people do this with absolutely everything, so much so that people will write this kind of nonsense about something as innocuous and irrelevant as tipping. People would genuinely rather pretend that everyone else has a certain opinion in order to win imaginary internet points than spend one second reviewing their own practices.

What a shame."

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1390167022.0,"The points that make diagonals are (6, -2) and (-4, 6), and (-6, -4) and (5, 7).

So y =  mx + b. m = (change in y)/(change in x)

For (6, -2) and (-4, 6), we have (6 - -2)/(-4 - 6) = 8/(-10) = -4/5. 6\*(-4/5) = -24/5, so we need to add 14/5 to get the right number. Indeed this line is y = -4x/5 + 14/5.

Similarly the second diagonal is indeed y = x + 2.

Now where they intersect, then the x-coordinates and y-coordinates are the same, so you get x + 2 = -4x+5 + 14/5

Subtract 2 from both sides to get x = -4x/5 + 4/5

Now add 4x/5 to both sides to get 9x/5 = 4/5

Multiply both sides by 5/9 to get x = 4/9.

keypuncher,conservatives,1390167050.0,"&gt; Military bases are charity? 

The whole point of lists like the one you linked is that the liberals who push them consider all government payouts to states to be the same: government ""benefits"" to the states - i.e., charity.

No, military bases are not charity - they have to be located somewhere, the Federal Government does that where it thinks is best, and it receives something back for the money it spends (in this case, land, military equipment and soldiers).

Likewise, when the Federal Government buys WIC cheese from Wisconsin, that is not charity to Wisconsin - the government is paying for a good or service.

&gt; Anyone who isn't completely fucking retarded looks at the numbers in this way: federal tax paid v federal benefits received. 

No, anyone who isn't completely retarded knows there is a difference between paying for a good or service on the one hand, and giving money on which there is no material return on the other.  For example, the Federal Government paying Hewlett Packard to host the Obamacare website back end is not a ""Federal Benefit"" to the state of California.  It is an exchange of Federal dollars for a good or service.  Conversely, the Federal Government paying states $250 billion for Medicaid is a ""benefit"" - the government gets no goods or services back in exchange for that money.

Federal Highway Funds are distributed to states and the Federal government gets nothing in return for them (well, nothing other than compliance with Federal regulations it can't legally require states to follow).  Likewise, Federal Medicaid funds, Federal payments to states for Food Stamps, Obamacare subsidies to individuals and insurance companies, etc.

I don't count most SS and Medicare funding here because the people of those states paid into those programs and the Federal Government was supposed to hold that money in trust.  Theoretically it is just returning their own money to them.

&gt; That's it. That's the metric that's used.

&gt; No double counting, no bias. 

Except that it **is** double counted, as I pointed out earlier, with the WIC cheese."

johnnytightlips2,ShitAmericansSay,1390167542.0,"&gt;States are often like their own countries

That's pretty literal off the bat, and that's the second sentence.

This is SAS worthy because it panders to an American belief that their states are the same historical and cultural level as other countries, and that America is analogous to Europe, not the UK or France. If you don't think that's a real belief, have a look through old SAS posts and just see how often it comes up. Whilst it is describing state pride, with which there is nothing wrong, it does so by reducing historical nations to the same level as sub-divisions.

&gt; SAHMs *are* new. Up until the 50s, it was unheard of for middle-class women to stay at home all day - only upper class families could afford to be single income. Yes, they did it 40 years ago. But 60 years ago, it was *new*. It didn't happen 100 years ago, 200 years ago, 300 years ago. The concept of one income households is a new one, that's just now starting to become financially impossible.

Women working was the norm in the 40s, 30s, 20s - ask your great-grandparents. A concept being as old as your grandma does not a tradition make. Women have *always* worked, save for a brief period in which the SAHM was idealised - and even then, not everyone could afford it. We can afford it even less now, just like we always have."

It's just impolite. You are right in the sense that old people are likely to be the first to actually chime in if *someone* was to step up to the plate.

Yes, I've seen elderly Russians treating the entirety of the new society with contempt. One of my favorite examples was in St. Petersburg when there was a chatty old fella walking around the metro with a newspaper, asking random passengers whether today's ""insanity"" would happen under someone as prudent as Stalin. But I've seen similar ridiculousness all over the place, from Philadelphia, where a cranky old man refused to believe that white people are moving into his neighborhood, to Tokyo, where I was once personally menaced by a crowd of (mostly elderly) extremists because I, a foreigner, dared film their anti-foreigner street protest.

1. cannabis should be sold pretty freely, like tobacco is
2. psychedelics should be sold recreationally, but have a requirement of an 'official tripsitter' the first few times, just to make sure they can handle the experience
3. similar thing with 2 for MDMA, although it should have limitations on amounts bought - rolling more than once a week is pretty bad for you, and this can be seen as preventative care.
4. benzo's should be similar to MDMA. You don't want to take them all the time, but once every now and then should be fine
5. stims like cocaine and meth should both have limits, and be monitored. They can form addictions very quickly, so it's important to have treatment plans for users.
6. Similar thing for opiates, they get addictive quickly.
7. Dissociatives such as ketamine should have buy limits (because kidney damage sucks).

plasticfirtree,AskWomen,1390168285.0,"The concept of belief in a fair world is called the [Just-world hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis). In my experience and from what I've learned as a psychology student, women are not more likely to believe the world is fair as supported in [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1975.tb00997.x/abstract) article (it's from 1975 though, so take it with a grain of salt)

&gt; A general hypothesis that
is relevant to all three dimensions is that the belief in a just
world will be diminished to the extent that a person has had
direct experience with injustice, This notion would lead us to
expect that the belief in a just world would be less pronounced
among women than among men, among older people than among
younger people, and among members of less privileged socioeconomic
groups than among members of more privileged groups.
The available evidence in each of these respects is mixed.

&gt; No clear sex differences in the belief in a just world have
emerged. Peplau and Tyler (Note 13) administered the Just World
Scale and a variety of other measures to 134 male and 1 13 female
undergraduates at the University of California at Los Angeles.
They found no differences between men’s and women’s just World
scores. Similarly, Rubin and Peplau (1973) found that men’s and
women’s scores in their Boston University study were approximately
equal. It may be speculated that although women in
America may have encountered more than their share of personal
and social obstacles, the prevailing ideological climate has seldom
led them to experience such inequalities as unjust. More recently
these inequalities have increasingly come to be recognized as
injustices, but at least on college campuses this realization may
be shared to a large extent by men as well as by women."

Almost exactly a year ago, I reached probably the most out of shape I had been in my life. I gained ~30 pounds in the span of probably 5 months. I told myself that due to my studies and girlfriend/family it was ok to not go to the gym very often.

I finally got it into my head that it wasn't ok, took a couple pictures, then made a concerted effort to start going to the gym. Because a lot of my friends played basketball at the nearby workout facility, I bought a pair of basketball shoes and started going. It was really hard at first. My knees and ankles hurt, sweating made me feel even fatter, and I was awful at basketball. But I kept at it. I learned to love the sweat and I started playing long enough so I started feeling a ""high"" after I'd been there long enough. 

That continued through the spring and into the summer. I got a job that involved me being on my feet all day, and lifting heavy stuff very often. The outfit that I had to buy to work there quickly became ill-fitting. And that just made me work harder and play more. 

Summer ended, classes started, broke up with my girlfriend, and I was even more motivated to get to the gym any chance I could. I've recently taken up lifting again, in order to tone up a little more and get some of my size back, but in muscle. But I have never felt better in my life. Being in shape has pushed me so much harder in every other aspect of my life. I finally like what I see in the mirror. And what makes me even happier is that I know there's so much more potential for myself. I like that think that I'm pretty darn good at basketball now, and I work a lot to get even better. 

Stats: 6'6""/M/19yo. Started at 295 lbs, down to 250.

snorting_dandelions,malefashionadvice,1390168654.0,"&gt; If you're just looking to share your fits, do the downvotes really affect anything?

The further down any given thread you are, the less visibility there is for any given comment. If a person came in, and downvoted each and every comment, then that doesn't really change a lot, sure. But if there's 5 people posting around the same time, and two of them downvote all the others, then you already have 3 comments with -1 comment karma. And reddit is pretty susceptible for snowballing, i.e. if something is downvoted , people are likely to pile more downvotes on top(just like highly upvoted posts usually attract more upvotes, because they get more visibilty *and* people like to agree with other people).

So yeah, if I want a lot of people to see my fit pics, downvotes aren't really helpful.. at all. I really don't see a reason to downvote fits in WAYWT threads to begin with. If you don't like the fit, a small comment explaining your concerns with it will most likely help the guy whose fit you don't like a lot more. A downvote just says ""I don't like your fit"", but it doesn't explain *why*."
msbubbles326,wedding,1390168669.0,"My girls got their dresses at Davids Bridal and we had no issues.

I definitely understand wanting to plan now, especially since the wedding was pushed back and planning would have already begun, but if the wedding isn't until 2015 I think your friend may want to hold off on looking for bridesmaid dresses because no matter the vendor a lot can change in a year. What if she tells everyone to buy a dress now, but a new collection comes out in six months that she loves even more? If you think she'll go for it, maybe suggest that it's too early to choose dresses since so much is likely to change before the wedding. If I remember correctly, it's usually suggested to order bridesmaid dresses 5-6 months out. It's enough time for ordering (and reordering if necessary) and gives time for alterations.

Point being that even the nicest apartment buildings might have this affordable housing available.

The neighborhood I live in is very industrial and it's not the cleanest but these buildings are very nice and it seems they're redeveloping the community. Granted it might be a different story if we were in Chicago but there are worse places in the Salt Lake valley to live too.

Sometimes there are work restrictions, or babysitting issues (two cousins couldn't find sitters... because they waited until last minute...), but honestly, it won't even matter the day of. Sure, there were moments where we thought ""gee, I wish so-and-so could have made it,"" but it was such a fleeting though since we were having such an amazing time with our wedding party, immediate family, and all the people who did make it! 

It sucks when not everyone you love can be there, but don't let it get you down. You're still going to have an amazing day- you're getting married! Your face will hurt from smiling, you will have a day full of love and laughter, and the people who can be there will make it so very special by sharing in the day with you.

It's the time signatures I have a hard time with. I'm privy to the ambient, floaty electronic music, or sub-genres with roots in hip-hop, funk, and R&amp;B. I have a hard time just tapping my foot or bobbing my head to it. 

I'll check out that video too, I appreciate you actually providing some insight instead of just getting upset. The video for ""Blind Faith"" by Chase &amp; Status really put the Londons underground electronic scene into perspective for me so I could understand your initial reaction to my comment.

The more important part of this post is that the lecturer wrote the lecture 6 years ago and hasn't updated it since then, when the study was 17 years old, i.e. the audience at which this talk is aimed are in their PGY-2. Furthermore, the NASCET study is now 23 years old, and we've added a number of medical anti-platelet options that might well compete with CEA as a viable intervention for older folks that are non-surgical by necessity or would prefer to *remain* non-surgical if possible.

SAHMs prevalence (or not) is an economic issue. You can either afford to, or you can't. Right now, people can't. Feminists aren't the cause of that. /u/kittenbun is blaming feminism for her not being able to be a SAHM - despite feminism being pro-SAHM, pro-maternity leave (which is a YEAR in the UK), pro-flexi hours. All things that help women that want to stay at home. /u/kittenbun also states it's as if we've gone back 100 years - when..

If your having the wedding and then the reception a few months later, skip the shower (unless you have your heart set on one), but register anyway. People will want to get you a gift, so why not open a registry? Most people will probably give you cash or a check anyway, but there are some who will be set on getting you a gift from a registry.

cssher,nba,1390170486.0,"&gt; No you literally can't make a case for Batum.

[I do what I want man!](https://vine.co/v/br95u7ZJbu0)

Ok I'll make one. Batum is integral to a team's that tied for best in the conference right now. He doesn't put up the big ppg numbers like Lillard and Aldridge, but I think he's almost if not just as important to the Blazers' success as they are. Consider:

* Batum handles the ball a ton to ease the load on Lillard and allow him to focus on other parts of his game. Hence, Batum is averaging **6** assists per game, the same as Lillard. That's massive for a small forward.

* The net rating stats mentioned in the article

* He's a viable three-point shooter, which can't be said for a lot of West SFs (*cough* Corey Brewer *cough*)

* But mainly, he has no real weakness in his game and is thus extremely versatile. Threes, midrange, above the rim, passing, rebounding (7 a game ain't too shabby). He can guard multiple positions, and use his length and hops to get blocks, steals and make good contests. Whatever the Blazers need on a given night, he can provide that. It's not surprise they are doing so well and Batum has such a high net rating.

Now, compared to Duncan, I guess the standout stats would be efficiency (59 vs. 52 TS%) and assists (6 to 4 per 36, although it might be better to use per game cause there's a reason Duncan plays fewer minutes. Anyway, inconsequential). And sure, you could make a case for Duncan by pointing to rebounds and blocks, but overall I think the argument's there"

I just like the air not smelling stale and dusty. It helps keep the interior clean and the vents free of mold. Not bad for $10.

I buy purlator or whatever oreillys has in stock, or the oem if I'm there and remember. I always use oem oil filters and air intake filters, but that's for the warranty. Imo, they work better and orbs with the money to buy them over washable or reusable air cleaners.

Well, there was the fact that he got DADT put down, finally. Further, and this applies to both issues, for the President of the United States to say something like this **is** doing something: it has an impact on views nation-wide, and on whether or not ""lesser"" elected officials voicing the same opinion would be political suicide. Basically, his statement about this has a normalizing effect.

&gt;  For the people saying that it should be left up to the states, I COMPLETELY AGREE.

Well, as with the whole gay marriage issue but *moreso*, it actually can't be left *just* up to the states. As I understand it, the DEA has been raiding state-legal dispensaries and seizing their equipment and funds for some time now. (There's also the question of whether it's a civil rights issue - I don't really believe it is in any meaningful way, but if you do, then as with gay marriage, it's also completely unacceptable to leave it up to states individually at *all*.)"

wordswench,gradadmissions,1390171364.0,"I am now at a top tier STEM PhD program, and I wrote thank you emails almost everywhere I went, but ESPECIALLY where I I really wanted to go. I would suggest you write thank you emails to people you interviewed with, at least. Mine were kinda like:

--

Dear Professor Tenure:

It was wonderful to meet you yesterday! Thank you for taking time to talk to me about your work; I really enjoyed learning about whatever the fuck you research. I will now mention a personal anecdote from our interview, and sign off with a nice professional closing.

Best,

wordswench

--

I made sure they sounded kind of casual and polite, not forced. So for example, with one professor, he was waiting with me to get coffee (we walked to get a drink during the interview) and caught a HUGE vase that someone else knocked over. 

So during the thank you email I thanked him for his heroism and service to the general public, because we'd built up kind of a joking rapport. I wouldn't suggest trying to force a joke but for me it was a way to make the email sound more personal and less scripted."

lcr68,MonsterHunter,1390171581.0,"I've been experimenting with both of em and prefer gun lance because of the overall combos compared to the lance. I prefer a fluid combo compared to the 3 stabs, defend and repeat like I've experienced with the lance. With the gunlance after 2 or 3 stabs I can either do a charge shot or a shot and repeat said combo instantly or choose to reload my ammo. Many other options are available so it's fun for me personally. Plus, it's a freaking lance with a gun. 



Basically what I'm getting at: if defensively minded and if you like a slower play style, go with the lance. If you like making combos and having plenty of combo options whether it be striking or shooting, stick with gunlance. 



Obviously this is a novice's opinion. I have 240 hours in the game but have no knowledge of the numbers game. I am pretty much playing with weapons that are fluid and fun to use to me and the lance isn't one of them (at least right now).  If I'm not maxing on my dps then so be it.

No. There isn't. Feminism is about the freedom to decide what you want to do. It supports SAHMs, physicists, florists, mechanics, porn stars, secretaries and soldiers.

&gt; flexible work schedules, actually are likely to encourage women to stay in the workplace by making it easier to work and raise kids at the same time.

Like I said, working or not is a financial thing - you can either afford not to or you can't. If you can afford not to work, and don't want to work, flexible hours won't convince you to do so. But if you *can't* afford to stay home, being able to choose when you work and when you're home can make it easier to spend the time with your children you want."

Questioning moderation style and responding to comment removals is also against the rules, we ask that you take things like this to mod mail instead. I appreciate that you did take the time to read our rules though, and like I said, if you don't feel creepyPMs is for you then you don't have to participate here of course :)"

Wow, was it really necessary to be so condescending?  Coming from a guy who misspells ""Daenerys"" no less...

Anyway, in response to your (poorly formed) argument, all of the things that you listed were done in protection of her own children.  Killing the bastards removes possible competitors to the throne, making sure that Joffrey will stay in power.  Arya harmed Joffrey (even if it was Nymeria, she blames Arya) and could be a future threat to him.  Cersei perceived Tyrion as a threat to her children, the cause of her mother's death, and the eventual cause of her own death (the valonqar prophecy).  Unlike many characters, Cersei doesn't do malicious things just for the sake of being cruel.  When Cersei is cruel, it's always a calculated move done to protect herself or her family.

If you can name an instance where she did anything to harm her own children, I'd love to hear it.  That's the one place that Cersei will never go as a character.  The only thing I could *possibly* imagine would be killing Tommen &amp; Myrcella in a misguided attempt to ""save them"", like the Texas woman who drowned her kids in a bathtub."

cssher,nba,1390172882.0,"&gt; Duncan's stats are better

That's just flat out not a certain statement. Batum plays more minutes than Duncan, *and in those minutes he's helping the team win*. You can't just spin that and say more minutes is bad. Which would you rather have, Above Average Small Forward for 40 minutes or Lebron for 5? I'll take the first one.

Batum is more efficient than Duncan at this point in his career (again, 7% gap in true shooting is pretty damn big). With Batum on the floor the Blazers are a much better team: with Duncan on the floor the Spurs are actually [slightly worse](http://www.82games.com/1314/1314SAS.HTM) so far this season.

Win shares, I know it's a lazy stat but it gives you some idea: Duncan leads .156 to .142 in WS/48, but Batum leads in WS total, 4.2 to 3.5, which probably matters more. Regardless, it's by no means a landslide for either player. 

&gt; while he is a good defender he's certainly not elite

He does things Duncan can't. How many positions can Duncan guard? Oh that's right, he tried and failed to guard Aldridge twice, with Portland beating the Spurs in both of their matchups this season. Batum averaged a triple-double in those two games, while limiting his assignment Kawhi Leonard to 8/5/1.5. Synergy has Batum as a very good pnr defender. It accounts for 138 of his 358 defensive plays, and opponents are shooting just 32% against him in these situations. Comparison: Andre Iguodala, a consensus ""elite"" wing defender: opponents are shooting 41% against him in this situation

&gt; There is no shot at Batum getting picked.

Again, not the point. It's who should get picked"

Willravel,PostCollapse,1390173067.0,"Grow a garden in your back yard with only collected rainwater (check your area to make sure collecting rainwater is legal) with a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, and save your best seeds for next year. I've been doing this for the past few years, and I've learned a ton about growing food. I've got jars in my bomb shelter with good seeds in them I saved from last year's harvest, and a few from the year before, which I'll be planting before too long. Do research into what types of fruits and vegetables are higher in nutrients (like growing Romaine and butterhead instead of iceberg lettuce). Take down notes about what does and doesn't work, and improve every year. Learn what composting materials and methods yield the best food, and how to keep your soil alive even during dry times. 

Also, go out and hunt small game, preferably without a firearm. Learning to trap hens and rabbits and catch fish is going to be far more helpful in a wilderness survival situation than shooting a buck with ammunition that could run out in a few years. Or weeks. 

Take first aid classes, as they are often provided for free or cheap at local community colleges. Learn about how to identify different kinds of wounds, and how to properly treat said wounds to maximize the odds of fully healing without infection. Keep a small book of diagnostic medicine with you so you can identify different diseases and how to treat them (more or less). 

The idea is to think about developing skills which serve you first and foremost, which could keep you alive even if you were totally on your own. Odds are good having such skills would prove useful in a true post-collapse situation. Don't get me wrong, being a blacksmith would be really useful if you were in a village and you were able to repair copper pipes for water or repair damage to vehicles, but that assumes a certain level of sophistication in lifestyle that may not exist. Start from the basics and go from there.

You issued the call, and he answered, bub.

The issue here is less about what you feel and more about how you are handling it. Your initial response to Dan may have been well intentioned, but came off a bit dickish. It's a phrasing issue. Instead of reiterating the fact that it was a TRIBUTE, you defended your design decisions by saying doing otherwise would be ""pointless and time consuming"". Dan also didn't say it was a bad Livery, just that the logos bugged him.

Then after Dan offered ways to make your livery better, you challenged him, inadvertently I guess, to do better since his talk was so big. And, you asked for his own designs so you could pass your own critique; your response was pitiful. You didn't even criticize his own work; you passed it off as ""comical"" and ""nothing to be comparing about"". That's not criticism, that's *judgement*. Critique is explaining why something is the way it is, not simply saying ""this sucks"" or ""I don't like it"".

It doesn't take a ""great"" designer (or even a formal designer) to offer valid critique.

But Sony has distribution rights, and that is an important distinction and Sony's greatest motivation. They get a bigger chunk of that pie.

NBC has the bigger appreciation for the fans. They have to. Community's ratings sucked last year. I wasn't worried then, either, but NBC has actually tried to mollify fans. Sony fired Harmon. I can't speak for what happened behind closed doors, but NBC and Sony had an intense meeting the day the show was renewed. With the very public departure of Chevy Chase, NBC was in a position of power. Again, I don't know for sure, but bringing Harmon back seems like an NBC proposed condition. Having a co-showrunner sounds like Sony, since they're footing the bill and all."

Most people (perhaps not this guy) don't intend to infect anyone, as the risk per sex act is actually fairly low especially if they are on antiretrovirals. It may also not be possible to compel a perpetrator to undergo a blood test to demonstrate that the HIV strains are related."

This sort of thing is something that should be communicated to the player. In cases where it isn't, like Lux, it was deemed to be broken because there was no noted cast time that I can recall, as is the same with Jinx's ult. You have to reckon that if Riot 1. does not change the tooltips in any way shape or form, and 2. does not include any sort of cast-bar during the cast of the ult.. but then does change the way it works, it was previously a bug. Just arbitrarily changing around an ability with no indication anywhere ingame because Riot has ""feels"" about where a champ is in the current meta doesn't really sound like their reasoning, and rather more like a bugfix. I think a more pointed explanation was that the bugfix was not a high priority relative to other much-needed fixes because the champ was doing alright until then.

I figure with jinx this sort of thing will likely go unfixed for a while until they get a chance to look at her kit's power overall again since many bugs/bugfixes can change the power of a champ and I feel like fixing this might be a slight increase to her power that she doesn't need currently.."

I live with my grandparents and cousin, and all together the total is just a little too high to get food stamps.

msbubbles326,wedding,1390174521.0,"I think save-the-dates for the party would be a great idea! If people are making a stink about the non-traditional wedding, treating the party more like a reception- an event all on it's own- might ease some minds.

My ex had a cousin who had a small destination wedding with immediate family only and then a couple months later held a reception with everyone else. She showed up in her gown and it was great! It was totally informal, but it felt like a real wedding reception. She even did a father-daughter dance in front of everyone, and her husband danced with his mom. Then she changed into something more suitable for the day.

The shower is still totally up to you. There's no reason for anyone to be offended one way or another, that's just silly. You're the bride, it's all about what you want! If you think people expect it out of tradition, but others would be offended by the idea since your wedding is so ""non-traditional,"" have a bridal get-together instead of shower. Invite all the girls in the family who'll be at the wedding and/or reception, specify no gifts required, but you'd like to have a girls day before you get hitched! Have a theme, maybe even play some games, and use the day to tell people about how lovely the ceremony will be and how excited you are for the party afterward! It might ease some of the weird tensions people have about the ""non-tradition"" too. 

From what I experienced with my wedding, people jumped to conclusions because of hearsay, but when I explained things it magically made it all better, haha. People are so opinionated about weddings, but it seems like once they see how happy the bride and groom are, or get a better first-hand explanation of things, they become more accepting and just roll with it.

DukeCanada,CrusaderKings,1390174580.0,"I imagine this is one of those scenarios we see on television in which the decrepit mastermind of the evil plan has the protagonist locked up/tied up/swimming with sharks. In that moment of euphoria the evil villain unveils his despicable plan to unfortunate hero, and then begins to laugh uncontrollably. The hero usually says something along the lines of *you monster!* or *you'll never get away with this!*. That's when the villain replies with a semi-witty but overly cliched remark and leaves the room. 

Obviously the hero escapes and stops the antagonist's evil plan just in the nick of time, and then passionately kisses the beautiful girl. 

I guess in this particular story the antagonist is some sort of undead ghost, perhaps a vampire or a zombie? In anycase, I'd avoid any and all occasions in which you may have to split up with your group or ""go in alone"" (which I never really understood, but that's another story). Also, if someone says *It's probably a trap*, it probably is. I mean seriously, everybody knows it. Even the helpless damsel in distress who's been locked up in a tower for the last 18 years.

I mean, come on man. This broad has been living alone, in a bloody tower with a fucking dragon skirting around it for her entire life; and yet even she knows it a trap. How do you not know this? Is there no Traps 101 course in hero school? It's even better when main character is a spy and the girl is some sort of regular civilian. I mean honestly, you're a kick-ass killing machine, one man army and brilliant strategist but you don't know that walking into evil liar all by your lonesome is probably a poor idea? How the hell does the girl know? 

Anyways, stay safe OP. Good luck fighting the undead villain/ghost from the past/some guy in a costume.

Constam,AskScienceFiction,1390174599.0,"Yes, there are many other force traditions, just none so widespread as the Jedi and Sith. Their practitioners are commonly called force adepts. Many planets had developed their own groups and traditions long before joining galactic society. The [Baran Do](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Baran_Do) Sages were a sect of Kel Dor force users on Dorin. The [Killian Rangers](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kilian_Rangers) were located on Kilia IV. The [Fallanassi](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Fallanassi) were an order of light side users on Dathomir, a planet more well known for it's dark sider force users, the Witches.

Sometimes, the Jedi (and presumably some dark side factions) would try to recruit these other force using factions like they did with the [Matukai](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Matukai). The Matukai weren't interested in following the Jedi Code however. The decline in prominence of these other traditions was due in part to the fact that during it's peak the Jedi Order had thousands of recruiters scouring the galaxy for all force sensitive children and bringing them back to Coruscant for training. 

The Force has been around a long time, so it stands to reason that some of these force adepts had a mastered their personal understanding of it. ""Master"" is a specific title in the Jedi order however, just like ""Knight"" and ""Padawan"". So it's debatable whether the Jedi would consider these force adepts true ""masters"", regardless of their skill in the force."

I completely agree with you that additional education on nutrition for children is something that can and should happen, and would greatly help counter childhood obesity.  On the other hand, that education takes years to set up, and to positively affect behaviors.  Removing the vending machines is something that can happen immediately.  

The main problem I have with vending machines in schools is that (at least in the US), schools are acting *En Loco Parentis.* In other words, they have a parent like responsibility to the health and safety of the students.  Because this, actions like removing a vending machine may seem like a nanny state taking over, and it basically is, but it is because of this legal responsibility of the school to care for the students within.  There are already regulations on what the schools have to provide as far as school lunches are concerned, and the presence of these vending machines makes it hard for the schools to tell if they are meeting their level of duty to the health and safety of the student.  Even if at 14, the student feels like they are capable and responsible, legally, they aren't, but the school is."

eighthgear,anime,1390174845.0,"**Uchouten Kazoku** - *Just* started this series, after having it recommended to me many, many times. It seems quite good so far. I do like anime that are based on Shinto mythology, generally speaking, and I always love Kōji Kumeta's character design. I can't say much for the overall story of the series, because I've only finished two episodes so far.

**Chouyaku Hyakuninisshu: Uta Koi.** - I'm almost done with this series, and it has been great. It is a shame that not many people know of this anime. I guess ""historical josei"" turns a lot of people off - as much as people complain about anime being all the same, I find that a lot of fans are unwilling to try different things just because of labels like that. Anyways, Uta Koi is a beautifully made series that manages to pull off some good romantic stories, mixing comedy with proper serious moments, especially after the first episode or two. The characters were likable, the art fantastic, and the series has made me want to learn more about Japanese poetry.

**Arakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge** - I watched the first season of Arakawa with a friend, and now we are watching the second one. It is basically like the first, though a little better, in my opinion. Not the best comedy I've seen, but still quite funny.

**Maoyuu Maou Yuusha** - Who doesn't like an anime than mixes fanservice and informational segments about four-field crop rotation? This is a curious series, for sure, but I am enjoying it.

**Sword Art Online** - I can't say much about the show, since I am only two episodes in. Picked it up because I am currently enjoying Log Horizon, which has a similar premise to SAO.

**Space Battleship Yamato 2199** - I loved this show the first time around, so I am watching it again.

Then try y = 0 and x != 0 which yields

Things like storage furniture, a couch, night stands, etc., are places to save. Pick up all your dinnerware at thrift stores; amazing deals to be found. For things like nightstands, side tables, etc., I find either a) Ikea or b) Target are good places to find stuff for cheap. I find great lamps on clearance at Target all the time. 

My other tip is to not worry about having 'everything' all at once. That's how you end up with an apartment full of stuff that you don't really like. Beyond picking up the things you need for basic creature comfort (a bed, somewhere to eat, somewhere to work if you work from home, etc.), let your apartment be empty for a little while if you can't find the 'perfect' piece of furniture in your budget. Those sorts of things tend to reveal themselves if you keep an eye out over time. "

doriangray512,TrueFilm,1390175357.0,"[Presents](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127151/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2) Directed by Michael Snow (1981)

This was the first Michael Snow movie to be shown at the National Gallery, and easily the one I was least excited about since this is the only one he wasn't going to be present for.  It can pretty much be separated into three (or four) distinct parts.

The first involved changing the ratio of the scene on the screen.  It starts with just a thin vertical strip in the middle of the screen and a very high sound constantly going.  Slowly, the strip gets wider and wider, and the height of the strip goes down.  As this happens, the pitch of the sounds changes depending on what changes are happening with the picture on the screen.  This continues until you get a thin horizontal strip with a very low sound.  I liked the idea, it was an interesting presentation, but nothing I found especially great.

The second (and possibly third) parts were where the film really shown for me.  It involved actors going through a scene.  The thing is, the stage they are on is also on some sort of truck bed or some other sort of moveable structure.  The stage is constantly moving back and forth at first, and it,s a lot of fun watching the actors deal with this.  There is also a record playing in the background that is constantly skipping because of this movement.  Eventually, the stage is tilted up and down as well.  Then, the stage stops moving, and the camera starts.  And it's movement is meant to run into basically anything and everything on stage until it's all destroyed.  This section made the entire movie worth while for me, and I would have liked if it was just it's own little short.

The final section was filled with little scenes shot by Snow.  A lot of birds flying, quick scenes of towns, children, strippers, other workers.  Sort of like something you might see with Jonas Mekas' home movie scenes.  Each scene is started with a drum beat, and silent otherwise.  They all are of varying length, so sometimes it'd be a lot of drum beats, other times just a few.  There didn't seem to be an discernible pattern with the beats or length of the scenes.  This whole section didn't really work for me.  At least when Mekas does something like this, personal clips are shown, he gives the clips some sort of context, meaning.  That was completely absent here.  The lack of a pattern was probably the thing I felt was most bothersome, it would have been different if the beats had continued getting faster and faster.

Overall, the different parts didn't feel like they came together cohesively, and the final section really dragged the movie down.  Thankfully, the middle section(s) we're strong enough for me to have mostly enjoyed myself.

The idea that turning off the game as an alternate ending is one that requires a bit of meta thinking. Mind you, they didn't go out and advertise Spec Ops like that. They didn't say that there are four endings, or five if you count turning off the game. They advertised it as a shooter. What the game does is set up a typical shooter plot, and then pulls the rug out from under you by asking you to do horrible things, or even relatively simple things, but then showing you the horrific consequences. Now, do you fall into the trap? Do you complete the story, even though you are the problem, rather than the solution? It's reminiscent of the Milgram experiment, where subjects were asked to inflict pain on others simply because the authorities said so. If you do, then you're treated to the game's endings, where you're dealt a harsh lesson on the realities of war, and how they're trivialized in the modern video game industry. If you turn it off, then you're clever enough to figure out where the game is going, that there is no happy ending, that despite everything Walker does, he will create an ever deepening Hell, for himself, his men, and Dubai.

There's an important line at the end of the game, that sums up the entire point of the story:

[Spoiler](#s ""It takes a strong man to deny what's right in front of him. And if the truth is undeniable, you create your own. The truth, Walker, is that you're here because you wanted to feel like something you're not: A hero. I'm here because you can't accept what you've done. It broke you. You needed someone to blame, so you cast it on me."")"

But I also didn't have the balls to pull off the ones I thought looked really cool on other people. So I stuck with safe wire frames that most people wear but that look insane on my big head, and *very* animated face. It was only when I started wearing frames that were loud enough and quirky enough to go with ""me"" that I felt they really suited me.

So I find that people that dislike their glasses don't tend to spend much time choosing them because hell, they won't wear them much and they're just utilitarian and let's not try on too many or any ""out there"" styles for something I dislike - so you might have perfectly great taste!

So whats left to take about oh thats right the piece on the right or the tamper which does exactly what the name says, thats right it tamps shit down son.

I'm a med student, and I do know (from school and from personal experience) that when a woman comes into the ER with lower abdominal/pelvic pain, doctors are very much on alert and will take it very seriously.  However, until they can figure out exactly what's going on, then tend to prefer to not dull the pain (at least not completely) unless the patient is literally curled up into the fetal position and screaming.  The reason is because if the pain is dulled, it can be hard to figure out exactly where it's coming from, making diagnosis more difficult.  Still, that seems like much longer than it should have been, and I hope you weren't the ""curled up screaming in pain"" patient, because that would just be gross negligence.  They should at least have given you a low dose of something, just to make you a little more comfortable."

2. Sorry I'm busy - This could be one of two things. She's actually busy, or flaking. In either case ask her ""Is there a better time?"". If she gives you a day, perfect. If not, it's probably just a soft rejection, in which case see point 1.

I agree. If you take away all of the emotions, anecdotes and ideology concerning firearms, and look only at the data, what you see very clearly is that guns do not make you safe, and if you're a woman, a child or suffering from a mental illness the presence of a firearm in your home increases the odds that you will be injured or killed by said firearm. I believe that guns make people *feel* safe, the way a belief in God makes you *feel* safe, which is why people cling to both with such fervent defense. No one wants to be told that what you believe in may not be accurate.

That being said, firing them is fun as hell, and I have no qualms with anyone owning or operating them legally and safely. What I take issue with most is the belief that owning them somehow makes you safer (an appealing fantasy, especially considering the culture of the independent loner in the US) and that without private firearm ownership our government would become tyrannical and fascist over night (again, a paranoid fantasy that does not happen in countries with lower rates of private gun ownership).

beanfilledwhackbonk,AdviceAnimals,1390178137.0,"My penicillin allergy story:

I was 13 or so and taking penicillin for something like strep throat (I don't recall exactly what it was). A day or two into the prescription, I started having HUGE itchy hives all over, like mosquito bites you couldn't cover with your hand. They'd come and go, probably owing to the ebb and flow of the drug in my system at the time. Anyhow, that was the only symptom, and we didn't know hives were such a big deal.  
  
The morning of the third or fourth day I woke up unusually early, like at 5:00, itching like crazy. I vaguely remember crawling to the bathroom (didn't seem strange at the time), thinking that a hot shower would help. My parents woke up at the first few muffled thuds, then at some point they realized the shower was running and put two and two together. They raced in and found me on the bathroom floor, blood everywhere. The hives had finally lowered my blood pressure to the point where I couldn’t stand without passing out, but each time, I’d wake up on the floor without knowing what had happened and try to stand again. I was doing that in the shower over and over. I managed to bash myself against every protruding object: the spigot, the faucets, and the heavy porcelain soap holder on the wall, which I broke with my head. Amazingly, I was fine other than cuts and bruises. No one has ever forgotten that I’m allergic to penicillin."

laaabaseball,windows,1390178515.0,"#Option 1: Maybe you need a fresh windows installation. 

##Don't download any ""speed up"" programs from the internet. A lot of them are scammy. 

The *best* way to speed up your computer is to reinstall Windows. You *should* first backup important files, either to an external drive, or use a cloud service such as Google Drive or Dropbox and back them up to there.

If you are able to get a hold of a disk, you can use the instructions here to reinstall. http://www.pcworld.com/article/248980/how_to_format_your_hard_drive_in_windows.html (Scroll down to **Formatting for a Fresh Windows Installation**).

There may also be a ""recovery partition"" included on your hard drive. Here's a procedure I found from a 2010 page on Toshiba:

1. Restart the computer.

2. Repeatedly tap the F8 key until you see the Advanced Boot Option Screen.

3. Select Repair Your Computer and hit Enter.

4. Select your country &gt;&gt; OK.

5. On the System Recovery Options Screen select Restore Application.

6. Follow the on-screen instructions.

8. When prompted, select on ""Full Factory Recovery""

9. Select Next &gt;&gt; Yes.

10. After a couple of minutes the recovery will be completed.


If that doesn't work, try typing into Google your computer name (Toshiba ###), usually found on the bottom of the laptop and ""recovery partition"" into Google and see if you can find instructions.


#Option 2: If you cannot in any way reinstall windows, there are a few programs that you *can* use to clean up stuff.

[CCCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download) (get the free version) is a program that you can use to clean up old file caches and empty your recycle bin. Some people may have issues with the registry cleaner, so don't use that.

*Pop-ups* indicates some sort of malware on your system. There are free tools that you can use to clean the malware from your system.

[Microsoft Security Essentials](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201) is a free program provided by Microsoft to monitor and clean your computer from common malware and viruses. Download and run it.

[Malwarebytes](http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) has a free version of their Anti-malware software, and is one of the best out there for finding malware and viruses. In combination with MSE, i think your computer can be very clean, and much faster.

#Option 3: Maybe update to Windows 7! (Depending on your computer, you have to make sure it can run it.)It has Windows Security built in, and is almost exactly the same as Vista, but better and faster.

It had a premise that hooked me in, but then everything else was just... amateurish. I feel mean describing it that way, but the writing felt like the writing of someone who writes as a hobby. It broke so many rules, and not in a good way. More in a, ""Who bought this for publication and who was editing this?"" kind of way. I probably won't read the next one.

This week I'm finishing up **The Silver Metal Lover** by Tanith Lee. Speaking of rule breaking, I've always found her writing really weird. Sort of like Clive Barker, if Clive Barker's writing was more flowery and less grotesque. I'm not always in the mood for her, but I'd been looking for this book for ages and finally found a copy in a used bookstore. It is older than I am and has the ugliest cover art I've seen in a while.

Instead of having Nightwing's book derailed whenever Batman wants to hang out with his kids, maybe we could have a 'crossover' book for the Bat family, like Justice League. Or a Superman family book, with Supes, Conner and Kara. These characters are strong together, but when they abandon their own stories to interact, it weakens them."

customcharacter,gamegrumps,1390179135.0,"I thoroughly disagree about the story portion. While I agree, largely the side-scrolling games sans Fusion have been rather story-light, *there is still a story to be told*; Just because there's no story outright stated does not mean there isn't one. Metroid Prime, for example, had actually quite an in-depth story told through all the chozo lore, space pirate logs, and even just through the creation of some of the enemies you face. 

The thing is, Metroid fans have always found Samus being a badass bounty hunter, unphazed by nothing. You just explore the area, killing anything that tries to stop you, and surviving things that would have killed anyone else (even if it hinders you and requires you to build your strength again). 

Suddenly, Other M comes along and COMPLETELY butchers that. She becomes an emotionally burdened, weak character who relies on her 'superior' Adam for orders. She doesn't lose her abilities through surviving through the skin of her teeth; she just decides not to use them for the sake of people who are, for the most part, nowhere near her. In addition, by Other M, Samus has beaten Ridley FOUR FRICKIN' TIMES. (Metroid, Metroid Prime 1 &amp; 3, and Super Metroid), yet she has a PTSD attack when facing him in Other M from the fact he's returned. Something which has not happened in any other Metroid game.

The reason people get pissed off at the narrative of Other M is because, with it being the second-last game in the timeline so far, it *completely* contradicts the character of Samus people have become accustomed to. If it were the very first game in the continuity, then the actions and emotional behaviour of Samus would become a lot more justified.

With that rant being said, I will agree that the gameplay is a lot better than people say (other than the fucking pixel hunts). But it sounds like you misunderstand how much of a narrative Metroid *actually* has."

I also went 3 offensive players because I think the Raiders will sign more free agents on defense than on offense. And after going QB with the 1st pick, I thought it would be a good idea to start surrounding that guy with as much talent as possible, like what the Colts did when they drafted Luck.

So: 5/(x-1) + 8/(x+1) = 8/(x+1)(x-1)

Multiply by the LCD (x^(2)-1) to get 5(x+1) + 8(x-1) = 8

Use your distributive property to get 5x + 5 + 8x - 8 = 8

Now combine terms to get 13x = 11, or x = 11/13.

Your LCD is correct, it's that you think that 5(x+1) = 5x + 1 instead of 5x + 5

For the next problem, you get 8 + t + 5(8 - t) + 25 = 0, or 8 + t + 40 - 5t + 25 = 0. Then 4t = 73, so t = 73/4.

I would suggest getting the  Gigabyte Z87x-UD5H mobo because I doubt it could get easier to do a hackintosh build on another mobo. I literally just made a Mavericks install USB and installed the damn thing. No problems. Everything works.

Make sure you use http://au.pcpartpicker.com and http://staticice.com.au to find the best prices for the parts.

If you want to get some parts at a better price, also check Amazon for things. Got myself a PSU and a EVGA GTX 780 for a combined cost that saved me over $200 compared to local prices.

There was a post earlier on /r/buildapcsales which I think said that Amazon has the 760 for $200. Add shipping and exchange rate costs and you'll still might save $50.

Also browse /r/hardwareswap. That's a sub for people selling their parts. Can get really good deals there at times. Seen 7990s abd Titans go for $500 and below."

To me, and this is just one opinion, it sounds like you still really cherish those values you formed in HS. Sex is an intimate, romantic act between two people. (Or me and my hand. Sigh...)

Sure - not everyone thinks like that. But it really sounds like you do. The reason that your dad probably hammered this in (even if his views aren't the same as yours) is because it's really difficult sometimes to abide by the values you set for yourself. If achieving every goal and living up to every standard was extremely easy and you never worried about a mistake, it'd probably be because your standards are too low. Right?

Dr_Destructo28,TheBluePill,1390180708.0,"To be fair, this was originally posted in offmychest, so this guy likely wasn't posting a story about how horrible women are, but instead telling a story about some people who treated him badly.

As far as some of the points of the story go:
It didn't sound like he was doing anything other than paying.  If he had been involved with any of the planning or invitations, he could have voiced concerns along the way.  Still I think it's reasonable to expect to be on the wedding invite (with mom and biodad) and for his list of 20 people to have been invited.  I think it's perfectly fair for the person paying to have some amount of control.

However, I think it was unreasonable for him to expect the menu to be totally allergy free for him, unless he has a severe contact reaction.  So long as there are things he could eat that do not contain the offending foods, he shouldn't expect the entire menu to be for him.  I have vegetarians coming to my wedding (that my bf and I are paying for) and I'm not keeping the menu entirely meat free.  There will be vegetarian foods for them, but also roast beef for everybody else.  

It's also silly for him to be offended that his step-daughter wanted her biodad to walk her down the aisle and dance the father-daughter dance with her.  I can sympathize if he was a bit hurt by it, but his reaction was way overblown.

He also expressed his frustrations in the worst way possible and everyone there probably thinks he's a massive tool.

Still, I hope that this guy would still be very annoyed that TRP is using his story for their woman hating masturbation session."

It's funny because Syria's something that's been in the news ever since things started getting worse in mid-2011, and no one's ever said ""Syria doesn't matter or isn't newsworthy""-- although various people have tried to take the situation and the suffering of the Syrian people and use it to their own ends.

Israelis can't claim any moral high ground on the Syria issue, that's for sure-- the Knesset and the indifferent population seem to be fine with the violence continuing as long as Syria is in a state of contained chaos. I guess they don't give a shit if it spills over into Lebanon, either, and they certainly don't mind lying about the deaths to make it suit their agenda.

In this regard-- no one can deny that Assad is a bastard and he did allow for things to spiral incredibly out of control in the earliest days, but the reality is that the majority of the dead and wounded in this war are combatants on either side.

Which isn't a good thing, either-- apart from maybe the takfirists and extreme Salafi Jihadis or the other sectarian, narrow minded ultra-conservative Islamists amongst the opposition buying it."

If I can answer what I think your question is, the declaration of independence wasn't a sudden shift in attitudes.  It led to the invasion of the neighboring Arab countries, but after WW2 relations in Palestine between Jews and Arabs had devolved to civil war before independence was declared.  And events both before (the riots in the 1920s), soon afterwards (such as the expulsions during the subsequent war), and much later significantly impacted how things with Israelis and Palestinians played out."

Had the election fraud they perpetrated not occurred, Obama would not have appeared on the Indiana Primary ballot.  Hillary won the state anyway (barely), but had Obama not been on the ballot at all, she would likely have gotten significantly more of the vote.

An additional 5-10% of the popular vote in Indiana would have given her the *National* popular vote (yes it was that close, look it up) - and that might well have caused the electors at the convention to pick her as the nominee rather than Obama."

Alkalannar,cheatatmathhomework,1390181059.0,"Let's break this down

r = Price

c = Cost

e = Ebay

p = PayPal

m = Margin

r - c - e - p = 0.15r, or 0.85r = c + e + p

Let's break this down by category. $50 price or less has the biggest fees, so (0.85)(50) = c + (0.22)(50), or 0.63(50) = 31.50 = c. So anything that costs 31.50 or less is going to have the biggest amount of fees taken.

(0.85)(1000) = c + (0.12)(1000), or c = 730. So anything that costs between 31.50 and 730 is going to have the middle amount of fees taken.

Otherwise, 0.81p = c.

So if 0 &lt;= c &lt;= 31.50, then p = c/0.63

If 31.50 &lt; c &lt;= 730, then p = c/0.73

If 730 &lt; c, then p = c/0.81.

Once you have the price, then you can calculate Ebay and Paypal fees."

The right math assuming 10/10000 is the chance is as follows:
P(No one gets HIV) = (9990/10000)^31, 
P(At least one person gets HIV) = 1 - P(no one gets HIV) = .305

What you computed is that exactly one person gets HIV.

Using the fact that his partners may have been receivers, (50/10000) the chance is more like 14% that at least one got infected."

The_White_Baron,learnmath,1390181516.0,"The most annoying way is to count it by scratch. On the 2nd floor, you can have 1 person leave, 2 people leave, etc. This is given by

C(8,0) + C(8,1) + C(8,2) + ... + C(8,8) = 2^(8) as you've noticed.

C(n,k) means you want to select k members from a group of n, but you don't care which is which.

On the third floor, there are 9 possibilities. 1 person got off on the 1st floor, two people, etc.

If n amount of people are still in the elevator at this time, then there are 2^(n) ways for them to exit the elevator here. You also need to account for different people being on. This is given by C(8,n) which means out of 8 passengers, you choose n of them to stay.

So all the possible ways for people to exit on the third floor are

C(8,0)2^(0) + C(8,1)2^(1) + ... + C(8,8)2^(8) = 3^(8) (I used wolframalpha for this).

Now assume that when we hit the 4th floor we now have *m* passengers remaining. There are clearly 2^(m) possible ways for them to exit on this floor. Now we need to take into account *which* passengers they are. First, to get to the 2nd floor we had to choose C(8,n) for n passengers left. So now we choose C(n,m) for m passengers remaining. 

The explicit sum gets a bit tedious to write at this point, which is written more compactly as

ΣΣC(8,i)C(i,j)2^(j) where the double sum indicates we sum j from 0 to i, and sum i from 0 to 8.

Evidently, according to wolframalpha, this sum is equal to 4^(8).

This is a nice pattern. So when we hit the fifth floor, we deduce there are 5^(8) total possibilities. However, this includes the possibility of people not leaving the elevator on the fifth floor. So let's explicitly kill those choices off.

There is C(8,8) ways for all people to stay on the elevator. There are C(8,7) ways for 7 people to stay on the elevator, etc.

So we need to sum up C(8,8) + C(8,7) + ... + C(8,1). According to wolframalpha, this sum is 2^(8) - 1.

Whew! Finally done. The total ways 8 passengers can leave the elevator is

5^(8) - (2^(8) - 1) = 5^(8) - 2^(8) + 1.

EDIT: This is assuming that the order in which they exit doesn't matter."

&gt; Sounds like you don't want to answer.

It sounds like you don't want to admit that I *have* answered, several times.

&gt; Because it does seem you are fine with making it more difficult for certain groups of legal voters to vote.

Of course I am, if it ensures the integrity of the election process.  Likely, so are you, if you were to be honest about it.

Consider that there are already barriers in place to make it more difficult for several groups of legal voters to vote - and that those barriers are in place to ensure the integrity of the election process.

Lets examine what removing some of those barriers would look like:

Paraplegics and quadruple amputees are incapable of signing their name, so we should remove the sign in requirements for voting, because it is a barrier to those groups.

Currently, ballots are printed, which disenfranchises the blind.  Braille ballots are available for the blind, but what about the blind who are illiterate?  It is illegal for anyone to enter the voting booth with a voter.  Discrimination!  We must allow people to assist blind, illiterate voters in the voting process (of course no one would be able to tell whether the assistant helped them vote for who they actually wanted).

Having election judges and verifying whether people have voted already unfairly discriminates against the dishonest.  We should remove those impediments to people voting as many times as they want in whatever names they want to."

Pretend you are someone who likes it.  To be clear:  pretend you are someone who likes it, not that *you* like it.  I have found that this technique works in all sorts of situations.  Are you disinclined to make the rounds at parties?  Within reason, pretend you are a version of you who thoroughly enjoys doing so.

Once when I was in school I had to wear a mask for a theatrical piece.  I never will forget the experience because merely by donning that mask I felt all kinds of inhibitions instantly melt away.  From that experience I took away the lesson that ""fake it 'til you make it"" actually makes a lot of sense.  If you commit to playing a role then, more easily than you can imagine, you can pull off the impersonation sufficiently to achieve your goals.  Do it often enough and eventually ""you"" will be able to do what your persona can, without having to wear the ""mask"" of the persona you initially adopted."

So:  I'm pro legalization.

But:  No...it's not just like smoking regular cigarettes and it's different from alcohol.

Let's not be stupid.

But the most off-putting thing is now to see so many saying, ""Legalize ALL drugs!""

Some of us wondered if mj legalization was going to be a slippery slope for proponents of legalizing everything.

Why is it my business if you live next to me and you use meth?

Well, you're likely to let your property go...lowering property values.  Do you have kids?  I have to worry that you are neglecting them, because meth is a really UGLY drug.

Pretty soon you can't afford repairs on your car, because you can't hold down a job...because you're a meth addict.  So it's sitting there on blocks because you sold the tires for meth.

I have to wonder about the parties you have and the sort of folks that you are inviting over.

Ditto many other kinds of drugs that need to remain illegal because illegality IS something that makes people think twice before they decide to indulge.

And when did we decide that addiction is not a factor?  Why would we want to make more accessible, things that are dangerously adddictive?  Things that can transform people to people they don't recognize.  Has anyone EVER seen ""Intervention""?

So yes... make marijuana legal, but we need to closely monitor what effects legalization is having on society.  And for goodness sake, shut up about legalizing everything because it's nobody else's business.

They think ""oh, if I change just these few things the rest will work itself out and I'll have a perfect man.""  
Realize that women don't want perfect out of the box.  They've been dressing up dolls and manipulating reality since they were children.  They want to construct their idea of perfect.  Why else are so many men miserable?  I mean who wants to totally dump who they are to become someone they aren't?  Look at the things which pass for women porn.  It's not looks, money, or success.  It's the big idiot they have to reform.  The guy they have to work at controlling or understanding.  The guy who drives them a little nuts.  Even the women who know they fall into the same patterns can't help themselves.  It's coded into our social DNA.

So go out there and live your life.  Develop your interests.  Join a few meetup groups and meet people.  When you meet a girl, expect most of them to throw you the same big empty lines ""nothing,"" ""whatever,"" etc. that you heard in high school.  Have pity on them when they give you that longing ""why can't you read my mind and run this converstaion"" look.  Enjoy the ones who have a functioning personality and hope they aren't nuts.

The ex-g/f who's banging your roomate -- encourage her to get knocked up.  Tell her you think they'd make great kids.  Seriously.  It will get her (and your roommate) out of your life.  You're screwing your roomate over, but hey he started banging your g/f and probably before she dumped you.  "

Willravel,FanTheories,1390183272.0,"&gt;Loki's best bet, if his goal was to Asgard from Thanos and to redeem himself, is to just give the Tesseract to Odin.

...unless he believes that in the future he'll need Thanos to trust him again, and that's a big part of this. Loki's got two gems, but even without those two Thanos could become unstoppable. The Time Gem alone could be used to wipe Asgard from history. Because Loki's best strength is subterfuge, it makes sense that he'd need to be in a position where Thanos believes him to still be loyal. Now, because of the Avengers Thanos probably believes that Loki's incompetent, but he doesn't have any apparent reason to think Loki is disloyal. 

&gt;Plus getting thousands of people killed as part of an elaborate ruse doesn't seem like the behavior of a redeemed man.

Certainly not, but it does seem like the actions of a calculating man who's doing what he believes is right in an impossible situation. It's the old moral calculation, would you allow the deaths of three to save a thousand? It's not a heroic choice, but there are times when it is a terrible necessary choice, and it's possible that all life, past, present, and future, could depend on Loki's success. That's a big moral equation. 

Also, btw, Marvel Phase 1 was about the Mind Gem in the Tesseract, and Phase 2 involved getting the Power Gem in the Aether. Perhaps the ""phase"" is in reference to Loki's plan. "

You now know that an everlast machine is not what you want. If I were incentivized to give free advertising I don't think I would include the gory details of random screws and bent circuit board mounts (all the boards are good). In all fairness I could have chosen to send it back and get a new one shipped. *I* made the decision to trust the warranty and just run with the machine as it is now since it works very well, and use the warranty should any problems occur.  

Based on my review which you deemed positive, you'd not buy one. So it was helpful. My hope was to give more info on what the experience of buying an everlast machine is like, so others would be better informed than I was, even after I did lots of internet research on their products. 
Bottom line for me is performance and machine features. Between this, the ease of talking to a human being at everlast, and the 5 year warranty, I'm willing to put up with some Chinese manufacturing quirks and deficiencies.  You might not be, and that's totally cool. But now you know what it's like to buy a machine from everlast.

It's a dog eat dog world, always has been, always will be. Until we evolve into a type 1 civilization, assuming a disaster doesn't wipe out every single human being. Think about it, our world is much safer today than hundreds of years ago. Well for most of us. We don't have to worry about being attacked by hostile tribes or anything. Violence is at an all time low in this day and age. There was far more conflicts in the past that have wiped out large percentages of the human population. It's just the process of building ourselves up, breaking down, and building up stronger. The Earth is the way it is for a reason, and that is that decisions are made based on necessity and survival. Sure shitty things happen to some people, but it's basic Darwinism. They have to in order for the strongest regimes to hold their power. But one day America, Russia, China will eventually break down, and a stronger, more conscious race will develop from that. Most people aren't conscious enough to handle a utilitarian world. We still have natural survival and competitive instincts. People would still fuck each other over if the world was this Utopia, we aren't ready for that. Some people may be, but that's besides the point. The world is this way for a reason, and that is basic evolution and survival. I know this will get downvoted but this is the logical truth. 

I'm not justifying 9/11 I'm just saying it was a necessity for our government to maintain their power.

ulvok_coven,AskHistorians,1390183712.0,"The other post is wrong, as far as I understand - the word cannonball refers to things that weren't rockets, grapeshot, or exotics like carcasses. However, there are 'shot' cannonballs and 'shell' cannonballs. The Huolongjing, a famous 14th century Chinese treatise, references both, specifically talking about round, hollow metal shells that would be filled with gunpowder, and (IIRC) the context was about use in cannons, not just trebuchets or the like.

I don't think they were used in Europe for some time, but Chingis Khan was using shells on open fields and during siege.

It's a ball, and it goes in a cannon, and I believe that qualifies to be a cannonball.

So, were there explosive cannonballs? Yes. In naval warfare? Yes! [Here, after just a cursory search, is an account of the adoption of shell-firing guns.](http://books.google.com/books?id=Qz5KAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=naval+warfare+shells&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c4YYQ4vGey&amp;sig=J4bDAkyWR2pYwokClkb2LdRKrTQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-oPcUrW6L4T4yQG87ICoCg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=naval%20warfare%20shells&amp;f=false) For a tl;dr:, the book represents naval minds strongly cautioning against the use of shell guns, because they were relatively low-range - they couldn't pack too much of a punch because that would detonate the shell - and the shells themselves were unreliable. Shot, on the other hand, is quick, safe, and accurate - the explosive power didn't mean so much when you could just tear through wooden decks with sheer momentum.

EDIT: And there is a serious difference between a carcass and a shell. A carcass is a lit incendiary, meant to spill open when it lands. A shell is an explosive, a gunpowder weapon."

irondal2,depression,1390183946.0,"I'll give it to you straight. The reason I know more about ASPD than depression is because I saw a few psychologists in my mid twenties concerning whether or not I suffer from the antisocial, or narcissistic personality disorder, and I have done research over seven years for personal understanding of the latter two disorders. I do exhibit both narcissistic and antisocial traits, according to three therapists, but it doesn't mean that I meet the criteria for diagnosis of either disorder.

Depression, I've got it. Actually, I went to the therapists to nail down diagnosis of the right personality disorder, but instead wound up with diagnoses of depression and anxiety. Mine is just the opposite of your situation, but since I have been tested for all of the above, and I even wrote quite a bit about the ASPD specifically for research assignments, both undergraduate and postgraduate, I know what you think you are.

The best advice is you should not base your self-perception upon what you're told, once upon a time, by one lady with a phd. Go see another therapist. Go see two more. Find out if there is consistency. See about whether you can stand any of those therapists for an elongated doctor-patient relationship, to talk through your behavior. Work through your depression. Be as objective as you can be about something subjective.

As for your offspring, probably in the literature you have heretofore read about the underpinnings of ASPD, you have seen mention of the conduct disorder. Conduct disorder is different from ASPD in that a patient must have reached her eighteenth birthday to be diagnosed with the latter. A child who gets a conduct-disorder diagnosis could very well grow up and also get an ASPD diagnosis. So, it's best to address conduct-disordered behavior therapeutically before you have something else on your hands.

I cannot, by any means yet, speak authoritatively about depression and ASPD, but I can tell you that I have been passionate about educating an overall undereducated public about what the labels can mean, as well as the more mundane, characteristic qualities of individuals who are living with an antisocial personality. It seems like you are still working through the shock factor, and possibly a therapist could help you. Just be mindful that ASPD is among the dramatic disorders in cluster B, and that says it better than your therapist's biases in interpreting your personality tests.

People will judge YOUR drama, but you're your own harshest critic. A lot that you'll learn, through therapy or reading or just time spent living life, will lead you toward self-acceptance. Your state of mind will defeat that ignorant notion that all individuals who exhibit pronounced antisocial or ""sociopathic"" behavior are bound to be the next Charles Manson killers."

daisyismydog,RandomActsofMakeup,1390184083.0,"Most primers are silicone-based and have ingredients that are found in moisturizer. You can most definitely layer moisturizers (as there are different kinds) and primers usually contain occlusive ingredients that will prevent evaporation of moisture from your skin. This means that a primer will likely increase the efficacy of your moisturizer while providing a base for your foundation. Some silicones can also function as emollients which is another class of moisturizer. Emollients help fill in crevices and make the skin appear smoother which is generally what most people try to achieve with primers. 

Therefore, face primer (at least a silicone-based one) has some of the same benefits as two classes of moisturizers. Your face primer should not interfere with your moisturizer and if anything should increase its efficacy. If you're concerned, I suggest waiting about 10 minutes after applying your moisturizer to complete the rest of your makeup routine.

Water-based primers are less common than people think because most silicone-based products list water as the first ingredient (but they function like silicone-based products and should be treated as such). Oil-based primers can in theory provide similar benefits to silicone-based primers as most oils are occlusive, but I'm not sure if they generally contain emollient properties. 

Edit: I forgot to answer the question in the title. My favorite brand of moisturizer is CeraVe and I use the cream. I also like using rose hip seed oil as an occlusive and I think the brand matters less than if it is cold-pressed. For reference though, the one I'm currently using is produced by Nuriva. "

This is what I feed my Dane.  She gets 7 cups of the dry food and 1 can of the moist food each day.  In the morning, she gets 3 cups of dry and the can of moist, then in the evening she gets 4 cups of the dry food.  She gets the occasional meat trimmings when I trim out a chicken or pork chops or something, but those are so few and far between I count them more as treats.

I used [this calculator](http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-feeding-tips/dog-food-calculator/) to find the proper serving size to maintain a healthy wait for her.

One word of advice, I know that Iams is marketed as a premium pet food, but [The Dog Food Advisor](http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/iams-proactive-health-adult/) suggests that their food is overpriced for the level of nutrition that your dog gets from it.  The big problem seems to be that they use a lot of filler products in their food.

It is sad to think that ""premium"" brand like Iams is barely different than feeding your dog Old Roy."

It has significance to me because about 80% of the music I listen to is electronic, and I do listen to IDM as well. You'd think I'd enjoy sounds on the harsher side or more in your face.

I felt like I should find something in the genre I could enjoy and get on board with, but every time I came across something I really disliked it.

If I remember correctly, HCA hosts their servers in a central server room and remote sites connect from their VPN from their city. If the ISP's are crap in your area. and you have the same setup, that may be a factor.

From a security analyst perspective, if it happens on a daily basis during peak business hours, the network (internal or external) is being bogged down and you'll need to find the culprit. Whether it be an infection outbreak or rampant P2P traffic, something is slowing it down.

Much of the documentation of the Mongol Empire contains at least one reference to shelling - the Mongols would barrage infantry positions in open field, or sit far outside enemy walls and tear their defense to shreds - although I understand these were likely to be catapults / trebuchets, and not cannons. The Hulongjing references more than one kind of shell, including poisonous and incendiary ones; they did have cannons at that point, but used gunpowder long before they developed anything like a cannon. al-Rammah, a Syrian chemist, described at length gunpowder formulas for different uses, but especially rockets.

In addition, there is the long history of grenadiers in Europe, which were elite troops specialized in - you guessed it - bomb-throwing. I am also aware of land-mines being used against Mongols in Northern China.

Explosives are exceedingly effective tools. Arrows and bullets actually have to hit you - a shrapnel-throwing explosive just needs to be within a few feet of you and you're somewhere between crippled and dead. It also completely negated armor, wooden fortification, stone fortification (if your bomb was big enough), and could be used at as long a range as any weapon in warfare's history."

AkiraZXE,gamedesign,1390185640.0,"&gt; “wouldn’t it be cool if…”

There was a full-3D(ish) shooter, a metal soundtrack, about demons on the moons of Mars with inspiration from Alien? Oh, wait, there is. A group of people had this idea, and they made that game. It was called *Doom*.

This article is less about cool ideas and more about letting people direct the flow of development who have no business doing so. Whether it's your suits or your players on a forum complaining about balance, they're not game designers, so making a cool idea into a reality isn't their job. It's the designer's job to take an idea or concept, figure out if it's applicable, and if so, find a way to apply it in a good way. Rather, I'd say that's the fundamental process of game design. It starts with an idea, and that idea is worked into a game. Features start as ideas, and are eventually worked into features. If those ideas are bad from the start, you shouldn't use them if you've got the option. Obviously there are hundreds of middle steps, but that's the basic idea.

I'd say the writer more wanted to make a statement about being told how to make games by people who don't know what they're talking about than a general statement about game design in general."

walladmajnoon,saudiarabia,1390185750.0,"I was being sarcastic but I am pretty sure you went into my comment history and assumed otherwise. since you insist on taking this seriously:

&gt;Now if you think that they are a plague that you need removed from this earth, then they have the same ideas of you.

no, no, no, although I think their idea of enforcing such ridiculous is extremely backwards but understandable, I don't think they should be removed from this earth, I think they shouldn't have the power of a law enforcement but of course, law enforcement here barely do anything since they distributing responsibility to other groups, i.e. najem. 

&gt;In other words you are just the same as them except the different ideologies you hold. So if your ideas are the solution then I have a bad news: you are part of the problem.

ya but you forgot about the part where I do not have power over that person if I wanted to enforce an ideology. if I am part of the problem explain to me why all foreigners are afraid to tell anyone their actual personal beliefs like religion without feeling afraid to punishment until their forced to relinquish their national id to these men? 

&gt;The crucial part of living is co-existing with others whether they are like you or not. You must set yourself to higher morals and try to help others. You think they are bad, then discuss this with them instead of making judgments by writing few words.

how can I co-exist with people that refuse to co-exist with other people, hate is a strong word especially when they dont know my distaste for them. also why are you so anally defending them? and if you know anything about mutaween then you have to remember their mentality, their doing god's work, rather you think I am wrong or not is irreverent. So when you tell me to discuss with them instead of judge them, I would hope that you are joking since their first instinct is to judge a person before entering the scene, I.e. the car chase that killed the two boys, a women by herself, just to name a few. On top of all that, you truly believe that even if I consider discussing with them, that my ideology would be considered or at the very less, reach their ears without flying over their heads since, in their mind, I am a misguided citizen and their the law of the land.

&gt;The real problem we are facing not the Russians, not the Mutaween, not the atheist, and not the Jews, not the Iranians and not the aliens but rather a dark future that ticking with every drop of oil we pull from earth. Try to think of this for a moment my friend....

actually I am, which is why I went to a university abroad and came back to saudi in hopes of implementing solution to our ticking problem, but its funny that you think ignoring everything else that is happening and wanting to focus on one thing is how the world functions. I think its funny that you lumped atheist, jews, and aliens into our pot of problems when atheist ism would probably be a better than our current system, if you wanna look in a extreme point of view. Jews have nothing to do with saudi, its the countries surrounding israel that should be dealing with it, also saudi have minimal to zero influence from anything that happens in israel. If we plan on becoming a religious tolerant country, THEN we can worry about Jews AND christians. Aliens? really? I am going to assume you mean illegal aliens in which case, yes they should be dealt with by returning them back to their respective country. 

p.s. I assume you gave me a lengthy reply because your sick of seeing people bashing mutaween but have you ever considered that, if these people get mentioned in a negative manner then their is something inherently wrong here?"

I would rather like to think of it that United would take the opportunity to buy a player before their price massively increases because of the WC.

No.  It's partisan.  C'mon now.  Having a bit that criticizes the administration every once in awhile doesn't make it non-partisan.  Easily 75% of its content is meant to appeal to liberals.

&gt;A significant part of why the Daily Show tends to be more liberal than anything else is because it is a show based on national issues and the dumb things said discussing them.

Huh?  Plenty of dumb things said on both sides.

&gt; It's social progress versus social preservation. 

I think this analysis isn't very deep.  There are times when progressives look back and conservatives look forwards.  It depends on the issue at hand.  It isn't as cut and dried as this.

drsfmd,politics,1390186611.0,"&gt; No it's not. That's complete and utter bullshit. For one thing, graduation rates among the poor are fucking abysmal. There are classrooms in the inner-cities of this country where 35 kids are sharing a dozen 15 year old textbooks. 

I live in one of the worst school districts in my state (we're ranked #426/429). You're right that the graduation rates are abysimal, but it's not because of the facilities or books. All of the buildings are either new or completely renovated in the last decade, they are all equipped with computer rooms and no computer is more than 2 or 3 years old. Plenty of books too. 

&gt;Colleges aren't going to touch those kids. 

Bullshit. The university I teach at brings in hundreds of kids each year who can't read, can't write, and never should have gotten out of grade school. Colleges and universities LOVE these kids, because it means huge checks from the government. 

&gt;Many of those kids have to get McJobs to help chip in at home as soon as they're legally old enough to work, and a lot of them end up making more money illegally slinging drugs. 

I did the same thing. I was expected to contribute to the household, and I mowed lawns and delivered newspapers. My pay went directly to my parents. I succeeded, and there's no reason that others can't too... but they need to WANT to get out of their situation. 

&gt; If people are earning more to sit on their ass than to get a shitty retail job, that's not an issue with welfare, that's an issue with how little that shitty retail job is paying, i.e., minimum wage. Walmart should not be allowed to pay someone so little that they still qualify for government assistance. By definition, the minimum wage should be higher than the amount that triggers government assistance. 

So do you believe that the paycheck a welfare recipient gets should be cut dramatically, or should Walmart lay off hundreds of thousands of employees when they are forced to raise wages? Can't have it both ways. Besides the idea that adults are working for minimum wage is a total fallacy for the most part. I got my first ""real"" job working in a kitchen when I was 13. I made $3.35 an hour (which was the minimum wage at the time). I worked my butt off, and within a year I was making (as I recall) $5.15 an hour. 


&gt;If you're working full-time and earning below the poverty line, than your employer is the scum-bag.

Or your employer is incredibly kind and takes pity on you, keeping you employed despite the fact that you have no discernable skill set. 

&gt; Also, the poor do contribute something, they pay sales tax on pretty much all of their income. Every cent they make is going right back to Walmart, McDonalds, etc. How high is sales tax in your state? Here in Wisconsin it's 5%. 

Meh. After income tax, property tax, school tax, sales tax, and all the rest, I pay nearly 60% of my income in taxes. Don't talk to me about parasites paying 5% and complaining about it.

No.  I don't think Conan is mean-spirited.  You just must consider, if you want broad appeal...that a large part of your audience is probably made up of people who are split, politically.

If you make joke after joke at the expense of one side of the spectrum and DON'T make jokes about the other side... it becomes noticeable.  I think that's where Conan failed.  But he can certainly recover, if he hasn't already.  I've seen the show maybe four times since it went to TBS.

It's not a belief system. I analyze facts, and the fact is that both Community and Up All Night publicly lost one of their stars and had showrunner trouble. But they did cancel a show that had excellent syndication potential and was produced in house and attached to their golden boy Lorne Michaels, but saved a similarly low-rated show they only co-produce and have no distribution rights for.

Aprikoat,summonerschool,1390189561.0,"the goal of the game is to break the nexus

i know it sounds redundant but when i was at bronze level i often forgot that and it was a way to remind myself to focus on taking objectives and covering ground+gaining pressure as opposed to getting a lot of kills, and it helped me view kills as a means of removing enemy pressure on the map so that I could take those objectives more effectively as opposed to OMG LOOK AT MY KDA (which doesn't really matter because you can go like 3/7 and still carry the game by means of being a pressure magnet that everyone killed while your team took towers and dragons and stuff for free while they were distracted)

Never underestimate a champion's potential when you're new. I used to think garen was objectively a stupid champion because in bots and my low level games they all sucked and i got overconfident and destroyed by one later because i thought he was useless. And remember, you know less than you think you do and you aren't as good as you think you are (even as you progress and I still have this mindset about myself) so always have an attitude of learning. 

Just because you haven't heard of a champ being played in a certain way doesn't immediately make it a troll pick (taric jungle, nunu mid, and lissandra top for example are 3 things I've had incredible success with but aren't really meta- they just have particular strategies to them)

Also don't get any runes until level 20 and you can buy the tier 3 ones; the rest are cost inefficient and outclassed as soon as you can buy t3 ones. Make sure you have around 5 or so full generic rune pages for yourself before you head into ranked (I have 11 but they're all filled so that I can play any role and at the very least try to go even with if I'm horrible at it)

http://www.solomid.net/
Consult this for guides and cookie cutter builds to champions. I've read guides on literally every champion even if I haven't played them just to have an idea of what to expect of them and how to play as/against them just in case (because discovering kat does magic damage in spite of throwing daggers everywhere is very confusing and frustrating if it's your first time playing against her)

A lot of times when I was newer I found myself not knowing how to pressure and end games and they'd wind up being 50 minute arams where everyone had full builds and threw themselves at each other until someone surrendered or got aced 15 times. If you win a huge teamfight, you gain literally nothing from it if you don't pressure the map somehow. Take some towers, steal their buffs, take a dragon, whatever. Just do SOMETHING (that isn't wraiths i swear to god i see people prioritize wraiths over inhibitors). If you kill all 5 of them and are low, do not recall. You can still take a tower at 200 hp if literally nobody on the map is there with the ability to finish you off. Take the turret and THEN heal.

If you're building defensively, you want a mix of health and resistances generally. If you have a thornmail but 1000 max health you're not really going to get a lot of mileage from it because you die in like 3 hits anyways and you don't have any padding if they throw magic damage at you.

Armor and magic penetration are more important than you may realize. 6 bloodthirsters is all well and good (it isn't) but if they have heavy armor you'll still do no damage because their defenses will make you tickle them. Getting a last whisper as a third item for example on an adc lets you ignore 35% (!!!) of ANY armor they build. It really makes a HUGE difference in the damage you do.

Doran's items are really good too and their power really can be underestimated. Yeah, a longsword and potions gives more flat AD and regen than a dorans blade and one potion (on an ADC or Marksman, FYI- they refer to the same thing), but db gives 80 max hp that can really make the difference early game in lane when you're csing and trading and fighting, as well as the heal on autoattacking that helps you stay healthy and someone who just started longsword likely can't handle with the extra hp and healing that the one who started blade can and will be forced out of lane, killed, or forced to hide behind their turret and lose out on farm."

hardcorelegend43,videos,1390190139.0,"I am well aware Slavery has occurred outside of America, and the time period I referenced. However, the majority of the slaves in the US &amp; Caribbean were captured &amp; traded for from Africa. In addition slavery didn't boom until the early 17th century when tobacco really became a mega cash crop. 
This goes to speak to my earlier statement that, since many African-Americans/black are descendants of slaves either in America or the Caribbean, they were bred for strength based genes.

Again, I posted on a comment about *african-americans* and *their* slavery. No other slavery is pertinent here."

LeeTaeRyeo,outhere,1390190152.0,"I do live in the South (specifically, Kentucky). Well, the people in college towns tend to be pretty accepting. Outside of those towns, people tend to be less accepting (especially if you live closer to the Appalachian Mountains—I live in the foothills). Personally, I've known three or four gay men and women whose families have disowned them when they came out (one of the reasons I haven't come out to my parents—I'm not financially secure enough to handle being disowned at the moment, should that happen). I know of only one out gay person in my county (of about 14,500 people).

In the schools, there is definitely a lot of anti-LGBTQ+ prejudice. I remember one story very vividly. When my brother was a senior in high school (age 17, for those who come from a differently structured education system), there was a bisexual guy that transferred into our schools. By his third day in the county, he had been beaten severely and had to leave the county. The people that carried out the beating got off the hook by claiming that he had made a pass at them, though there was no evidence (and there were people claiming the contrary).

Now, I've been a bit negative there. Things are getting better. The younger generation is gradually becoming less homophobic and the older generation is passing away. In the Appalachians, behaviors and beliefs are slow to change, but they are changing."

hammayolettuce,UCSD,1390191036.0,"What do you intend to major in?

One of my favorite things about UCSD is the dine with a professor program. You basically choose a professor you'd like to get to know (check out their web page to see research areas), ask them when they'd be available to grab lunch, then go to your college for a voucher. Yeah, you don't have to pay and neither does your professor! This really opens up opportunities for research experience and letters of recommendation. 

I also really like the advising system. You have advisors for your major, and a different group of advisors for your college. It gives you a chance to connect with a lot of people on campus who are all there to support you. 

The school is really big on research- even for undergrads. I know that all of the information online seems kind of geared towards STEM majors, but the truth of it is, all you have to do is introduce yourself to a professor and tell them you want to learn about research in your field. Get to know them and if they think you're serious about it, they'll probably take you on as a research assistant. You can even get credit for it if you sign up for a 199 course. 

If you're looking to work right after receiving your degree, I recommend checking out Port Triton (you'll need your student id to log in). People post jobs and internships for both students and alumni. I also receive emails about all sorts of job fairs and free seminars because I made a Port Triton account. It's awesome."

AirdustPenlight,linux4noobs,1390191061.0,"A lot of reasons. It's very vanilla for one; i.e. I don't have to worry about how Slackware's special version of so-and-so is going to interact with another program. It's just the vanilla version of that program. It implements very little from upstream, which makes it very stable and makes sure things are halfway good before they make it in. Though, they recently added Network Manager, which is a travesty, but I digress. 

It's very modular, very easy to work with. Some other distros **really** like to undo the changes you've made and constantly reinstall their own crap without warning every update. Because the end user couldn't possibly be competent enough to modify their own system right? There's none of that with Slackware. It's very lightweight and works *particularly* well with Thinkpads. It'll natively support almost all of their little gizmos out of the box (e.g. the ThinkLight). Check out [Thinkwiki](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki) for more on that.  

In terms of basic or simple it is that, but that means it comes without some of the hold-your-hand tools that other distros come with. But that's what simple and basic means in the computer world. Given the fact that I don't like the computer telling me what to do and that this comes with the benefit of extreme reliability and stability it's become my strong preference in terms of distros.

Some people may have told you Gentoo because it's faster but... ignore that. The majority of Gentoo's speed comes from the fact that it makes you throw a bunch of flags any time you install or compile something to speed it up. There is *no reason* you can't do this on your own on any other system. Gentoo just makes you do it. This is one of those hand-holdy things I was talking about earlier. Gentoo users for some reason think watching ./configure scroll by makes them super 1337 but... it doesn't. 

It's late and I'm tired. I hope that rambling was decipherable. If you need help installing it (people sometimes do) then PM me. 

TL;DR
Vanilla, stable, doesn't tell you what to do, lightweight, good for Thinkpads which are the only laptops I'll ever use.

LeeTaeRyeo,outhere,1390191236.0,"It is an interesting journey. People don't generally assume my atheism is a result of rebellion. Like my being gay, my parents don't know (I'm a gay, liberal atheist—I'm practically sprinting to Hell, according to their beliefs), and the people that know I'm an atheist don't really know my family.

I don't get offended easily, so it doesn't really bother me when people assume I'm atheist due to rebellion. I just gently correct them and continue on with my business. The thing that helps me keep my cool is knowing that I took the journey and nothing anyone else thinks or claims can take away from that.

In line with what you've said, my personal belief is that good people come in all forms and with all different sorts of creeds. There are good religious folk, and there are mean religious folk. There are good atheists, and there are mean atheists.

On the subject of reconciling science and religion, it is possible. From a Christian perspective, science and religion can be reconciled. For instance, the Biblical concept of the world's creation is kind of vague, which does not preclude the acceptance of the Big Bang Theory. I don't personally hold these beliefs, but this is the kind of justification I have gotten from my religious friends that work in science."

Siddicus,AskMen,1390191251.0,"Something that I saw from another thread a while ago, think it deserves a mention here.  

On a date:  

If someone comes up and flirts with you while on a date with me (say at a bar), and you do not instantly shut him down, that to me throws red flags everywhere.  If you are receptive to others trying to pick you up with me right in front of you, how can I trust you when you aren't in the same room as me.

Now others have varying opinions on the matter (such as it is the man's responsibility to ward them off), but that's my stance. 

Edit: just for some clarification, the key part of all this is ""If you are receptive"".  If you flirt back, than that's a problem, simply ignoring it is not being receptive (though I prefer a little subtlety, similar to /u/Paper-Bag's response), and if he persists, than it is my part to jump in and get him to back off."
Turkstache,explainlikeimfive,1390191273.0,"The best way to understand depression is not through its causes and solutions but through the feelings depressed people have.

American society defines you by your value to other people. When you feel like you have no value, you feel like you're out of the loop. You wonder why people in the same situation as you can feel happy.

The trait that most depressed people seem to share is a feeling of low self-worth. You don't think people want you around, you don't think you will succeed at your endeavors, you want to have certain traits that you think would improve your life - looks, intelligence, work ethic, fitness, etc - but the goals seem impossible to attain no matter how hard you try.

Eventually, it's difficult to enjoy things that you would have when you weren't depressed. You get caught in a circle... one contributing factor: You don't feel like your friends REALLY want you to go out with them so you grow more distant, they stop reaching out to you, which further causes you to lament that you can't socialize.

On top of it all, various problems have life-long implications... custody battles for children, debt, legal problems, bills, employment... Each one on its own might be manageable... but the combination of it all is a constant annoyance. Unlike in other countries, Americans can much more easily sign documents that will cause them a once-a-month reminder for a lifetime of one or more of these problems.

TL;DR: Mo' money, mo' problems."

Gapinthesidewalk,AskMen,1390191879.0,"&gt;Or it's just bad luck :)

Then I must have very poor luck for it to last the past 6 years. I appreciate the sentiment though.

I do consider not being able to expand a social circle a bad thing and here's why: When I look at the friends that I have made, it's been because of, more times than not, circumstantial living situations. Granted, my one friend is from my high school days, but I tend to make some of my best friends by being their roommate first. That's probably a very odd way to go about it, but somehow it's worked for me.

Now, human beings are social creatures and success tends to stem from those who are able to connect with other people. It's not just about success though, a generally happy and fulfilled life is usually based around the people you have relationships with, friends, family, or otherwise. A wide social spectrum also gives a person better odds at making a connection with a potential girlfriend or boyfriend depending on what you're into. Yes there is the occasional person that can be perfectly happy and content being by themselves, but they are few and far between. I think my lack of experience speaks volumes about me as a person. It's just not a desirable trait, one that most people would draw out as a red flag, and the older I get, the worse it makes me look."
Aaron565,MensRights,1390191885.0,"The last bit is the best part. These women are so completely and entirely children.

They act like children, rationalize their immoral actions like children, possess childlike desires, and expect to get away with it all.

By this conclusion, feminists should be treated as children. Why? They could care less about equal rights; for them it is about getting the advantage. When they were all little girls they used their puppy dog faces to get an extra cookie. Over the years the power and applicability of their inherit bullshiting (used to *play* the men around them) has grown.  

Today they all continue to use these tactics of deceit. Only difference is now society **will** accept their social manipulation as quid pro quo for so much as disagreeing with them. Oh god help you if you want fairness in any way. Your purpose is to serve their every will financial or otherwise.

Since childhood nobody has told them ""No"". They have received everything they wanted. When they did something they knew was wrong, they could rationalize it in their head because nobody would hold them accountable for their actions. 

Keep in mind this is not all women, just a growing number of them. And if we are are to consider them children, they must be spoiled brats. Hell our brats are even becoming ""empowered"" now (as if they weren't benefiting already)! We get the short end of the stick within the court system, social system, financial system. Then they claim even more entitlement as *due payment* for their oppression. The oppression that **none** of us committed, nor **any of them** encountered. We are [17 trillion](http://www.usdebtclock.org/) dollars in debt. Our government spies on us. Our children deceived and little boys emasculated. 

Truth is....

We are the modern day slaves, us middle class men. We have, throughout history, lifted the heavy load and we continue to do so day by day. **Our** grandfathers were in the coalmines; they used their intuition and brute strength to pull us from era to era.

There is a war waged out there against masculinity; and a separate one against independent thought. 

Everything good or evil, every noteworthy development for human kind, has been enacted by a man.

Half of the world's population has a vagina, yet women each act as if they have the only one. So many men are deprived of companionship that they accept the bullshit and continue to nod their heads like dogs. 

I don't know about you; but I am finished with it. I will take my place as a man and take what I desire. I wont feel guilty for what comes naturally....

Western women today take none of the responsibility and reap all of the benefit. They do this and expect to be treated as equals; we gave them that. Yet they still complain, they still want **more**. What else is there for us to give? We are already subservient and now disposable. All we have left are our identities as men; and now they want that too!

Spirit stones are a waste of points on serpents. Give them holo-fields if anything. Live by the jink.

I haven't run a footseer in a while, switched to jet council and it totally rules, but the eldar powers aren't that bad. 50% good, 33% ok and Death Mission which is the worst thing ever. Generally, I'd be hoping for Fortune and settle for doom or even eldritch storm (depending on who I'm facing). You can also roll on Divination which has some pretty sweet tricks. 

I think the wraithguard as troops is probably more important to the synergy of your list but if you wanted to playtest the farseer, I would suggest dropping the d-scythes for wraith cannons and using the guard in a similar way that you would use fire dragons last edition. Turbo boost up field in the wave serpent, pop out and just wreck tanks. They'll stay alive a lot longer than fire dragons ever did and end up being a decent threat to your opponent's back line. 

Then ditch vehicle upgrades and get yourself a 3 man bike squad to fill that troops void."

LeeTaeRyeo,outhere,1390192447.0,"I wouldn't worry too much. The thing is, in Appalachia it is uncommon outside of the schools for people to confront each other for being gay when not discussing religion. The worst that you would probably encounter is an odd look from people if you are very flamboyant or giving PDA (then again, straight people get that look for PDA as well). Politeness is the most important part of life in my area, and it is not considered polite to call someone out for being gay (unless in church, where it is considered the most polite thing—they think they are saving you by trying to make you straight).

Also, you would probably get a pass on any ""odd"" (non-butch) behaviors because you would be considered an outsider. You wouldn't be held to the same standards as locals. It seems that being an outsider throws people's gaydar off in my area."

Siddicus,AskMen,1390192479.0,"&gt;My question is would you ever get into a relationship with a objectively masculine woman or do you find this unattractive? 

Absolutely I would.  

Also you mentioned you lifted but don't look masculine, there is a fine line between /r/hardbodies and /r/fbb, at least to myself, the former is incredibly attractive, while the latter isn't (at least in my book).  

&gt;Am I stuck with feminine men unless I somehow figure out how to be feminine myself? 

Potentially, though there are individuals like myself who are switches, where we like the polar opposites, being really dominant or submissive.  So you might try looking for something along those lines at least when it comes to in the bedroom for the immediate future (assuming your sub doesn't work out, *knocks on wood*).  

Getting in touch with your feminine side would probably be healthy in the long run, and would also greatly increase the group of men you can attract.  So that might be something you would want to look into but if that just isn't you, pretending to be something you aren't can be a turn-off."
