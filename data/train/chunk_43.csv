Renner1,PropagandaPosters,1390858361.0,"&gt; Because that once again illustrated your thinking perfectly. You see, unlike you I do try and make some conscious effort to not automatically prejudge everyone based solely on their ethnicity.

The one flaw in the statement I made regarding German Turks was calling them ""gastarbeiter"", which carries the implication that they're wholly working class and doing the work that ethnic Germans don't want-- which was certainly more of a prominent thing several decades ago.

A lot of successful Turks in Germany at present.

But do say where I'm ""automatically prejudging everyone"" based off of their ethnicity-- are you talking about the pro-Israelis in Germany or German Jews?

I don't see anywhere my judging these people off of their Jewishness, although I did mention the hilarious mentality of the ethnic German pro-Israelis and their hypocrisy in terms of racism or prejudice.

&gt; ""not being a giant bigoted dickhead all the time"", you should give it a try.

He wakes up in the morning with a plate of poverty from three nights ago. Poland has constant stomach problems. Poland doesn't care. He realizes that if he dies no one will miss him. His dad died from a potato by an old friend. Poland didn't cry at his dad's funeral. The walk to toilet is always hard. Poland used to own a Lada. Soviet bombed it. Poland sometimes wishes that he didn't get out at the last minute. Poland passes by the poor on the streets of Kraków. Poland has no spare change, but pretends he has but is too rich to care. Poland arrives at toilet at 6:30 am. No one thanks him. His plungingwork is hard. But he knows that it doesn't matter. If he died today there would be another sad sap - probably Latvia - who takes his place. At 7:00 am the other plungers arrive. Poland has Wodka made for everyone there. No one thanked him. Poland considers putting more Wodka into the Wodka pot. His mind races with the problems that would be solved. He sits back down after not being able to make up his mind. At 10:00 am Britain walk in. No one enjoys the managers. Everyone knows that they are only there because Germoney invade Soviet, stupid Germoney no into learn from Napoleon. Poland doesn't judge though. He just sighs to himself and contemplates Auschwitz. At lunch the groups form up and go off to lunch. Poland is not invited. Poland just imagines a sandwich. Polan sees a bug in it. Polan eats it anyway. Polen gets up to throw away his imaginary food and passes his coworkers toilet. No cleaning has been done. UN sighs and plunges it himself. Poland clean whole bathroom. Poland put it back in its right place. No one thank Poland. Some chew him out for doing parts of it wrong. Most don't care. Poland cleans up his stall and starts to go home. Britain stop him and hands Poland a portable toilet. Says its homework. Poland isn't buying it. Poland says nothing. Just stuffs it into his bag and nods. The walk home is cold. Poland sees no more homeless. They are probably dead, Polan thinks. Polan remembers college seeing the shiny plunger at Bed, Bath and Beyond and what he wanted to do in his life. Poland remembers what his boss said once. Work makes you free. Poland keeps forgetting that for some reason. The drunk Slav at Poland's hole in the ground doesn't even flinch when Poland falls. Poland feels bad for messing up the mud. Promises to give the landlord extra grain for it. Never does. Poland walks into the hole in the ground. It is wet and Poland feels like he should tell the drunk Slav. He never does. Poland unlocks his door and silently thanks god that there was no eviction notice. Poland lies on the couch splintered floorboards and sees a message on the answering machine. Then he remembers he doesn't have a phone. Poland feels hungry. Hates what he eats. Wants to eat healthy. Orders Chinese food. It never comes. Poland walks into the bathroom. Brushes teeth and lies on the bed. Looks at the ceiling. Sees a spot. Contemplates life. Contemplates killing the Russian living upstairs. Realizes that he doesn't have the balls. Poland watches TV until early in the morning. Falls asleep. Dreams a dream of sadness and lost potential. Wakes up. Forgets dream. Starts a new day."

Realistically doing a 3 tabata workout with warm up, recovery time and a warm down you'll probably be investing about 45 min to an hour total into it. Anything less is pretty much half assing it either in intensity or reps. There's quite a lot of recovery time in sprint workouts just by necessity. 

On a treadmill that hits 15 you've got more options for sure. Have you got a good gauge on your current running fitness level? Like could you run at 12 to 15 MPH for a minute? Two? Less? How fast can you run on the treadmill for say 20 minutes?"

There are some managers who have little PC skills and just copy over last weeks schedule...but then they lose the history which can be very important.  We also print out the schedules for posting, so the ability to print in a decent format is important.  It doesn't take too long for me, as I just copy past the prior week's schedule, but there can be issues.  I like to also add rows to input things relevant to that week...for example in housekeeping, it's good to know each day's occupancy, and number of checkouts...so I would add 2 rows below the date for that info.  In excel, sometimes the company has a master sheet that the front desk will update occupancy figures and then my sheet can pull that data...but as often, when many people use the same excel file it gets distorted and rarely worked.  So that's not important in my opinion.  One big drawback to excel is formatting...the longest time is always formatting it to correctly print.

I know it's possible because of this [Play Store has had an option for a while to disable automatic updates for specific applications, which could then be manually updated at the user's discretion](http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/08/21/psa-as-of-play-store-v4-3-10-you-can-finally-disable-automatic-updates-for-certain-apps-and-update-all-will-honor-these-settings/).

I want to add that Demmian also straight-up banned people from /r/feminism (as well as the alt subs, like r/askfeminists) just for posting on SRS. I was banned for that (I presume...he also won't answer any PM asking why you were banned.)

Together they strode across this earth, they walked across great rivers, vast forests and lumbering mountaintops. They conversed with flower, animal and wind alike. Like this they had traveled all their lives.

One day, they encountered a sphere in the sky, larger than the largest mountaintop and warmer than the warmest lava bed.

""What are you, to stand in our way?"" asked the inquisitive Sapling.
""I am."" the sphere replied ""I will be and I was.""
""What do you mean?"" said Shed
""I am here to bring you power beyond your imagination. I have decided that you four are to become Time.""
The siblings were stunned for none of them knew what time was. But they were all very curious so they decided to accept. The sphere started glowing and reached out to each of the siblings in turn.

""You. Sapling for your curiosity, lust for life and warm heart I grant Spring. Your time will bring new life to the world each time you walk the Earth. Bloom for your heat and splendor I grant Summer. When you walk the earth the life upon it will prosper, let all living things drink deep from your heat. Shed, the hardy one, I grant you Autumn. You will bring change and hardships so all living things are reminded that there is more to life than to prosper.""

The Sphere came to Snow and said ""Snow. You are the last of the four and you will become death. You will fall from the sky and reap all living things not wise enough to shelter from you. But you will also be beautiful and when you start falling, the earth itself will bless you for without death there can be no life."""

if you live far-away, pay a lawyer to do it.  The typical lawyer fee to see an eviction through will run you between $500 and $800.  You can find lawyers easily through google.

Now, you can do it yourself, BUT, if you make the most minimal mistake, the entire eviction can fall through at the last moment, and you are back at square one.

Secondly, make sure you have your ducks in a row, if you forgot to apply or renew your Philadelphia Landlord License (or permit, or whatever its called) you simply cannot do an eviction.  Another big one is joining PGW's Landlord Cooperation program, if your tenants has unpaid gas bills, PGW will put a lien on the property in a heartbeat, and the landlord will have to pay it or lose the property over it. 

If, however, this person actually gets the rent to you, ableit late, but it gets in your hands, you may just want to wait until the lease is over and simply not-renew.  If they occupy the property past the expiration of the lease, its much easier to evict.  In this case, you can always apply their security deposit towards unpaid late fees."

For a person who is really seeking to maximize his/her own sexual pleasure, ruling out anything kinky seems like a very unlikely outcome.  But it seems exactly what someone would claim when they really just decided their preconceived ideas were more important than pleasure.

I'm willing to talk about, read about and consider all kinds of ludicrous stuff, just to see if something rings a bell.  And, having educated myself about those options, I can talk about those activities even if it's not something I would want to do personally.

It's also useful to understand things you won't do, because conditions can surprise you.  I would have sworn there were places my tongue would never go, until I found myself passionately wanting to stick my tongue there.  It was useful at that point to know the consequences, even though I never thought I'd do it.  And when I found myself with someone who wanted some pain with the pleasure, I didn't freak out.  Turned out pretty good, though it would never be my own choice."

This one time I had a bf who was a big pot smoker. He usually ignored me to go smoke. I had a lot of guy friends at the time and was pretty feelytouchy. I was cuddling on a bed over the covers with one of our mutual guy friends who I'd never date. My bf walked in and was pissed. All he said was, ""if thats what you want, go ahead and fuck him."" While i saw this guy as a purely platonic friend, I didn't see how it looked from my bfs point of view.


If my bf at the time had told me, ""Hey it hurts my feelings when you get really physically close with other guys."" I would have been really respectful of this and backed off. But I didn't know what I was doing. He never vocalized his being upset until it was too late.


Looking back, I can't believe how disrespectful it was. But I didn't understand. I thought it was obvious to everyone that I wasn't attracted to him.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,Frugal,1390860349.0,"The bike will save you cash, but only if you do it right. It's a lifestyle more than a money saver up front, but if you're a tough dude you can do it for cheap and make it more than worth it. I did all the math on my first bike and it will have paid for itself in 2 years if I can make it last, then it's pure ""savings"". But that's only if I drive it instead of my car (40mpg vs 17mpg) 4 or 5 times a week. 

My goal was to save money commuting tons of highway miles. I was a brand new rider though, so I didn't want to make a huge initial investment or get something too big for my riding level. I went for an old, simple, light bike that gets just fast enough for the highway and nothing more: 81 Honda CM400. In the power department that's somewhere between small and medium-sized. Its great for stop &amp; go and a bit inefficient on the highway. If I maintain it it'll last forever, it looks cool, and it was cheap as dirt. My introductory costs were more than the bike itself. I look forward to my commute every day now, but let me tell you...I'm really glad I still have my car for shopping, errands, and bad-weather days. 

Things to factor into cost:

* Training course - In Texas this is an up-front but necessary expense of $250
* Safety/riding gear - Expect to spend at least $800 just to get started as a daily driver. I spent around $1000 up front on proper boots, helmet, jacket, gloves, and thermal gear. If you don't get gear that you like to wear, you're going to hate the bike.
* Insurance - much cheaper than that of a car, but the risks are higher with a bike. Just like cars, there are ""risky"" models and ""safe"" models based on statistics.
* Maintenance - Bikes need more frequent maintenance but they are easy to DIY. You may want to invest in tools.
* Convenience - say goodbye to the quick stop-n-shop lifestyle. Say goodbye to bulk-purchases. Everything must be planned out ahead of time now unless you're buying a bunch of storage for your bike. Either way, everything has to be done in small quantities. Picture yourself on a horse, only without the ability to throw a lasso or shoot a gun.
* Weather - Sucks to show up to work wet/hot/cold/etc. Buy more gear or drive a car.
* Hair - Helmet hair sucks and is almost impossible to beat. You will save money on haircuts once you cave in and start shaving your head.
* Length/type of ride vs engine/tranny - My bike is a tad bit ""underpowered"" for the highway, so I waste gas revving 7000rpm for 20 minutes straight on my commute. Some bikes will be better for long highway rides while others will be better for short stop &amp; go. 
* Size - Bigger, heavier bikes get laughable mpg; especially if you are an inexperienced fat guy. I was very surprised to learn that smaller-than-a-car does not mean more economical.
* Traffic - If you think traffic sucks in a car, try traffic on a bike. It's torture. I think the stress evens out once you get going though :p
* Safety - No idea how to quantify this financially, but I've fallen off my bike twice (almost 3 times) in 3 months of commuter riding. Never got hurt because of good gear, but I've had some scary experiences due to other people not caring about other motorists' safety. It's crazy dangerous compared to driving a car; Don't let anyone try to fool you there. But everything's relative. It's safe enough if you're not an asshole. It's a life-changing experience, too. 


**TL;DR; I think in your situation it would be ideal to have a cheap car and a cheap bike, otherwise life could really suck. The option of a car is awesome if you look at it merely as a luxury rather than a daily driver.**

lorelei_,bisexual,1390860361.0,"I think this is most likely a reference to that fact that in a later Rolling Stone interview Bowie said that he was neither gay nor bisexual as per Wikipedia.

[David Bowie &amp; Bisexuality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie#Sexual_orientation)

Not that it matters either way, given that just because *someone* later realises that they're actually gay/straight doesn't necessarily invalidate any earlier thoughts they may have had about their sexuality. It infuriates me that people get so stuck in this idea that everyone should and does know their sexual orientation from the moment their born and that this never changes. This is a ridiculous idea.

My main side effects were weird in their order:

My time line was June- November 2013.  I am a 24 yo female, 145 lbs, 5'10"".  

**Side effects:** I noticed the dry lips almost within the week, and dry inside of my nose at about 2 weeks.  My lips really peaked at their worst 3-4 months in.  I think I went max every two hours without putting lip stuff on, I always had 2 tubes on me at all times.  I had bloody noses a lot the first month or two, the stuff in your nose gets really stuck to your skin and bothersome.  So you might casually pick your nose, pull off half the skin from the inside and end up with a bloody one.  Or just wake up with one!  I dried out completely; I learned real quick to clean my nose and lips in the shower with the help of the warm water and a very soft wash cloth. Oh, this is probably TMI, but I had trouble pooping.  My skin eventually became so dry that my asshole would crack and bleed from using the bathroom.  I highly suggest taking a bit of TP and just dabbing it with water to sorta faux-lube it up if you ever run into that problem.  I was pretty horrified seeing bright red blood when it wasn't my time.

I had a very bad initial outbreak that started about a week and a half in, I looked like a dalmatian, but kinda wore that with pride...I told myself NO make up unless i'm working or going to school, mainly because my face was so dry that it caked up, and also because it just looked awful with all the redness, bumps and scabbing.  My family couldn't even bring themselves to tease me about it.  

I rarely went out, I took online summer classes instead of classroom stuff, if I could.  I'm a tan-oholic, so i spent a lot of my days looking longingly outside hahaha! I decided not to risk any sun exposure.  

My doctor stressed eating with the meds, and I hate breakfast but learned accutane binds with fats... so, I started drinking CostCo breakfast shakes.  Filled me up, good amount of fat, were tasty and I could grab them and run out the door.  I did sometimes forget to take a dose.  I woke up late during the summer months and spread out my pill timing to 8-12 hours if I could, so I think overall I missed 5 nighttime doses that I made up at the very end.  If you miss, don't freak out, just keep going and finish when it's all finished.

I had depression for about a week in July.  It hit me like a wall, but I was very determined to break myself out of it.  I went from enjoying a lot of things to enjoying nothing all at once...I stopped talking to people, wanted to be left alone.  Luckily, I told my mom and alerted friends to let me know if I was acting weird while on this.  My mom threatened to have me be pulled off of it since I couldn't risk not graduating, and I freaked out and decided to force myself out.  I was lucky I was able to do it, I had started to work out which helped.

I had BAD joint pain start around August.  My doctor said that it's normally a beginning symptom, but mine came late.  My hip joints would start screaming in pain after running on the treadmill, and it got worse and worse over time.  First, I cut back my miles, then I cut out running and decided to just walk.  Nothing really worked.  Next were my heels, which that has kinda persisted some.  Mostly in the morning my heels will be super stiff.  I just did morning range of motion and got Dr. Scholl's.  I no longer need the feet padding, but the ROM is still nice in the morning.

My dry scalp was awesome when school started back up.  I did a test try just to see how long I could go... an entire week until my hair got enough oil on it for me to notice.  Now I have to shower every day, and damnit, I sorta miss it (dry shampoo just isn't the same, haha).

The absolute worst was about 3rd month in, I started sweating.  A lot.  Like, more than a lot, and I started to smell bad.  I've NEVER had that problem before, it was so foreign!  Normal deodorants wouldn't work, i had to get prescription strength and have a small thing of that on me at ALL times.  I started wearing undershirts and t-shirts under everything, and made sure I reapplied my deodorant 2-3x a shift at the hospital or at school.  

4-5th month in is when the joint pain was its worst, and I even had sciatica.  I am still unsure of why this happened, or if it was the medicine, but I'm pretty sure it was.  I had blinding, searing pain start if I bent my hips or back in certain ways.  I was sure it was due to inflammation of my joints, so I took NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin) to try and help.  Doing clinicals at the hospital for nursing was hell on earth from all the walking and bending.

I saw differences in healing of my skin.  Almost immediately, I had flaky, dry skin, and being a compulsive skin picker (no longer!) I HAD to peel them off.  I was obsessed with having smooth skin. So, the unfortunate part, is that when you do that, you tend to pull sheets off your skin and inhibits healing.  I did have SMALL bit of scarring from this, but nothing that microdermabrasion can't help down the road, if I feel so inclined.  Once I got picking and peeling under control, my skin healed up fast.  I stopped picking around month 3.5.  

I will say that I used to break out on my back and butt, but they cleared up the fastest because I was so focused on my face.  Self-esteem picked up, I started going to the store without make up and wear tank tops.  The first time I got told I was beautiful at the market, I went to my car and cried.  I was pretty happy to not feel dependent on make up.

Speaking of scarring, I had a crazy weird symptom where my raised scars *FELL OFF.*  It was shocking.  Scars I had for years on my arms were falling off, along with a few freckles/moles.

I did continue to break out during my period, but it was normally 1-4 very small, superficial pimples that were covered or popped very easily and went away in no time.  My problem areas were my T-area, especially my chin, and cheeks/jaw line.  Not one outbreak past the initial.  Not one cystic zit has happened since.

**So, post treatment,** my last dose was November 15th, my last derm app't was Nov 20th.  My derm and I jumped for joy when she saw me walk in with a super clear face.  My lips got better about 1.5-2 weeks after I stopped.  They still get a little drier than they used to, but I don't have to use the heavy duty Aquaphor stuff.  My joint pain took about a full month to clear up, and my heels still sorta are stiff in the morning, but I'm back to running and working out.  My scalp went back to its normal self about the same time as my lips, but my nose took a little longer.  I sweat a litttttle more than I used to pre-accutane, but the smell and amount are SO much less.  That also took about 3 weeks to go away.

I still have yet to have a cystic zit, or anything bigger than a pin head.  Nothing has appeared on my back, and my butt only has issues if I wear jeans with a thong (that... may not be related to anything other than a personal body issue, lol).  I start wearing make up again for fun (plug for /r/MakeupAddiction) but WILL break out if I don't remove my make up after the night, or wash my face in SOME form.  Not a full blown break out, but I'll start getting small blemishes and small pimples where my make up was the heaviest.  I occasionally have barely visible blackheads that are super easy to remove and of course my 1-4 period pimples that are easy to conceal.  I still use moisturizer on my arms and face every night and morning.

**TL;DR**  Some normal side effects, some not.  Been off it since mid Nov '13.  Acne has not returned, pretty much at all."

behindtimes,AskReddit,1390861180.0,"Back in college during the summer, within a span of 3 days:

I was driving home from the mall in a thunderstorm.  I'm at a light with a utility pole right by my car.  Loud bang, everything turns bright white.  When I can see again that pole was missing and there was a nice spark shower headed for my car.

The next day, I go out to get a phone line splitter so I can use DSL.  Earlier that morning, my collision insurance for my car expired.  Well, it just so happened that my brakes died on the highway, and the car in front of me stopped, and I couldn't change lanes due to other cars.

The day after that, my professor who I had been working for over the summer lent me his bike.  I'm riding back, and happen to be in one of the only areas in the entire town with a hill and trees, and a few people on motorcycles come and run me off the road (which landed me into the tree).

Anyway, later on that summer, I had gone to some relatives to stay for a week or so, and I woke up a little late and had to rush to the airport to catch the plane.  The light rail I normally would have taken to get to the airport though happened to derail and my flight was delayed."

James_GAF,bodyweightfitness,1390861472.0,"It sounds like that treadmill would max out for you in the 300-450 meter range. I don't know your top speed ability, but it sounds like a track is your best running bet for tabata. You can get a lot of the same benefits doing bike tabatas at the gym.

As far as the treadmill goes. I'd test how fast you can run 400m(a quarter mile) on it just a bit beyond your distance comfort level. Based on that time you can do a few different workouts. For instance 400m repeats with 1 minute walking rest in between. For longer recovery, higher intensity push the pace up near your max and do a 400m walking recovery. You can do jogging recovery, lower intensity quarters as well. I'd really recommend getting some track time in though so you can work 50m, 100m, 200m and running tabatas in though. 

I'm not sure what to suggest for scheduling. I'd tend to make the day before leg strength training moderate intensity. The day after a recovery jog maybe 80% of your 5k pace for 20 minutes. Whatever you decide on as your best option for maximum intensity Tabata 20 run/10 rest type work I'd look to schedule it equal days apart from your leg strength routine. "

But you're mostly right- they just aren't typically limb or life threatening, whereas large breeds can do far more damage far more quickly. Hence more media coverage. In terms of groups that work with animal behavior and animal adoptabillity, an aggressive dog is an aggressive dog- regardless of size. So it does matter when you get into fields that deal more directly with assessing dog behavior in relevance to the animal going to a new home, or needing special provisions to ensure no damage will come to people and animals living nearby (such as taller fences or insurance). That said, in my career I've never seen a chihuahua labeled as a ""Dangerous Dog""- a label given to dogs deemed dangerous by the law due to recurring aggressive incidents. 

It's funny how people lump pitties, rotties, dobermans, etc all in one group. They're entirely different behavior types due to breeding. Different genetic behavior traits because they were purposed for different jobs. For example, aggressive rottweilers and german shepherds tend to be aggressive on their own property, but generally won't go out of their way to chase someone up the block and eat them or anything. This is because Shepherds are guard dogs, but otherwise would rather have little or nothing to do with strangers, and tend to avoid them. On the other hand, when pit bulls *are* aggressive, they tend to have a ""catch it and eat it at all costs"" mindset. They're a very determined breed when they want something. Pit bulls are also less likely to bite in the first place than German Shepherds- Shepherds don't tend to like strangers, pit bulls are actually bred to be good people-dogs. Even the darker side of the pittie breeding needed them to be good with their handlers- just not with other animals."

* Our name was recorded in crayon on the back of a placemat.

* Our waitress didn't write down our order (perhaps the hostess was hogging the restaurant's lone crayon), instead rolling her eyes skyward and saying ""Uh huh"" after every single thing we said, whether it was ""I'll have a bowl of chicken noodle soup"" or ""Please make my sandwich completely plain with nothing on it at all.""

* We were never served our soup

* My sandwich was, of course, loaded with mayonnaise. They also managed to screw up my friend's order somehow...and all he had ordered were chicken fingers (I think they brought him mozzarella sticks or something).

* When I informed the waitress that I had specifically ordered my sandwich *without* mayo, her response was ""no you didn't."" You know, since she knew what I said better than I did.

* For the only time in our entire dining history, we left no tip.

Say I have a loan of $100 at 10% interest.  The monthly payment is $10.  I pay $100 immediately.  For this example's sake, I haven't accrued interest yet.

* Scenario 1: My $100 payment is applied to principal.  $100 is applied to the loan, and the loan is now paid off.

* Scenario 2: My $100 payment is applied to future interest.  The monthly payment, $10, is subtracted from the balance of the loan, and the lender keeps the extra $90 for future payments.  The next month, the loan's balance is $90 + ([$90 * 10%]/12 = $0.75), so $90.75.  Then, another $10 is taken out of the payment you send in, etc.  The end result is that you end up paying more interest.  In reality, all of this extra interest would be included in a ""10-day payoff amount"" or something like that, rather than keeping the account open and sending you pointless statements.  This scenario is advantageous to the lender because they are guaranteed a certain amount of interest, even if you pay it off early."

ciov3r,todayilearned,1390862086.0,"You're missing one of their issues: breeding. Though pit bulls are actually bred to be good with people, they're distinctly bred to be terrible with other animals. They also tend to be high strung dogs.

So, take a high strung dog with animal aggression traits, and give it to an unprepared or just BAD owner, and you get disasters.

Not everyone who takes on a pittie and ends up with a monster is a bad owner, so much as they don't do their research. Pit Bulls absolutely MUST be socialized early on with other animals and people. Otherwise, you get a dog with high energy, relentless drive, and a desire to eat other 4 legged creatures. They're strong, and when they want something, they're determined as hell to get it. Furthermore, keeping one near other animals where it can bark/lunge at them (such as in a yard where dogs regularly are next door or walking by) can lead to barrier frustration and frenzied behavior- signs of break down in the breed that aren't super uncommon. It's even more common in shelters, since they're surrounded by other dogs. Then you can see some of that barrier frustration channel into... disregard for the handler's safety. As in, they don't always go out of their way to harm a person, but if a person's between them and another animal, it can happen."

lyrics to me are really important to the enjoyment of the music though, if a song does not have lyrics it really has to bring it with the instruments.

to try and illustrate what I mean: The Beatles - [In My life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxCWPk85d74), would in my opinion be somewhat boring without the lyrics

The Allman Brothers Band - [Jessica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRDivUb5EeA), however does not need lyrics for me to like it because it has quite a bit more going on 

I love both songs but even though Jessica has more going on musically and makes me irrationally happy, In My Life has lyrics that can take my mind somewhere really deep. 

im sorry if im not making sense lol but I guess I just find lyrical songs to be more capable of moving me than instrumentals even if the instrumentals have more going on musically. maybe I *am* a poetry guy and I just don't know it lol

I love him as a player, but I think that's the one leap between him and a top-10 draft pick.

Specifically I can remember once (I think during the tournament) last year that the game was close late (UL up a couple with under a minute left), he got an offensive rebound and quickly threw up an off-balance three instead of running more time off the clock. He missed and let the other team have a shot to tie or win. Meanwhile, if he had just taken the ball back and reset the offense, they could have bled more time off the clock, drawn a foul, or otherwise made the most of the opportunity. But, he gets caught up in the moment and throws up a poorly selected shot. Luckily UL still won but it was in dangerous fashion."

I wanted him to sign the only movie of his that I had on DVD at the time: *Looney Tunes: Back in Action.* He obliged, but as he's signing it, he suddenly concentrates and realizes what movie it is.

""Oh...you actually *saw* this?"" he asked.

I met Patrick Stewart at a convention just after he was knighted. I asked a friend of mine who is of British descent exactly how you are supposed to address a knight.

""You have to say 'Sir' and then their full name,"" he told me.

I get in the booth, shake his hand, and say ""Nice to meet you, Sir Patrick Stewart."" I added, ""Did I say that right?""

Chuck (the character) is also at one of his most relatable stages during that season, as well.

I totally get that season 5 is very easy to re-watch because there are a lot of little details and small factors that are important to the storyline that are easy to miss in the first couple of viewings.

You can *trim* the fur if you like, such as shortening the tail up a little or removing the feathers around the feet, which won't ruin the double coat and would just help keep them from getting super muddy/dirty if they like to play outside a lot.

The only breeds that should be clipped to keep them cool are hair breeds (breeds without a double coat).  Those are dogs like poodles, Malteses, etc, where if you push back the fur, you won't find another layer of short undercoat."

How do you know the odds of Ireland being attacked are very low??, things can change in a short space of time. As I said, just because it's unlikely to happen at the moment doesn't mean it won't. Hell look at some countries in Europe, there have been vicious anti-government protests, coupled with the rise of far right political parties and economic hardship, don't seem cause for concern right now, but those conditions facilitated the rise of You-Know-Who!, and I know I'm stretching it there, but the you could make the argument.

If you've ever seen the situation on the ground you'd know an increase in funding would go a long way. Two reasons why you've never heard it. Reason 1. It's not in any military persons nature to complain, ""There's not to reason why, there's but to do and die"" springs to mind, reason 2. Under Irish law the Defence Forces have no right to unionize or peaceful protest (They have Representative Associations to put their case forward but it's not like the likes of SIPTU). 

You say yourself and I agree with you that The Defence Forces are doing an excellent job with what they have, and they'd do an even better job if they were given more. Do you seriously think that 8 small Patrol Vessels with virtually no aerial presence are enough to successfully patrol 251,000 square miles of water??

Eh yes dissident paramilitaries have been a persistent threat here for decades!!, in the last few years we've had the murder of two soldiers in Masserene Barracks, 2 PSNI officers, Ronan Kerr and Garda Adrian Donoghue, the repblicans see the Irish State as every bit as much of an enemy as the British one, how are they not a threat??

You said earlier that if such a scenario arises that we'd cross that bridge when it comes, would crossing the bridge be the usual Fine Geal/Fianna Fail tactic of closing the stable door after the horse has ran off??

Yes it is, because coupled with the change in the economic situation, technological advancements, training techniques and commitments as a member of the UN and under the Lisbon Treaty our military expenditure will have to rise. Your argument for not increasing or even decreasing our Defence Forces leaves no scope for possible future developments.

At the time, 4chan was less shitty and Reddit was a lot more shitty. I'd already been hanging around 4chan for several years, so that's the community I knew and was ready to get naked for.

I can't speak for other girls, but for me, camwhoring was mostly about fun. I mean sure, I enjoyed the attention -- who wouldn't? It's nice to be called sexy. If someone walked up to you and started calling you sexy, you'd like it too. Sure, there was probably a bit of voyeurism being fulfilled -- I think we all have a little bit of kink in us, and a touch of mild voyeurism is nothing unusual. Haven't we all had fantasies about lying naked in bed and somebody walks into our room and ""oops you saw me naked?"" Not everybody has the confidence or the sex-positive thinking to actually express those fantasies, but we all have them.

Plus I think that it can be a pretty healthy, safe (re: not in danger of contracting STD's/pregnancy/etc) way to explore your own sexuality, just like watching porn can be. Would you consider the guys sifting through 4chan/reddit gone wild and looking at the girls to be doing something wrong as far as exploring and expressing their own sexuality? Sure, people can let themselves go too far with porn, letting it replace human intimacy or otherwise watching for the wrong reasons, but does that mean the majority of porn-watchers are like that? Does that mean porn is inherently a bad thing to watch?

First we have to create so-called MRA theory, a framework that says men generally experience subjugation in society, then focus our research on those experiences and ignore anything pointing to the contrary, for the greater good of our righteous political agenda. I'll prove anything. I'll prove rich people and beautiful people are being discriminated against. 


---

How about not starting with the conclusion? How about testing the theory by making predictions before knowing the results, then see how they hold up? 

The fact that sociologists can't achieve total objectivity does not give feminists the right to embrace their own bias.


---

Since you didn't give me a source for your statement about this being normal sociological practice, I found some:

&gt;Value neutrality does not mean having no opinions, however. It just means that sociologists must strive to overcome personal biases, particularly subconscious biases, when analyzing data. It also means that sociologists must avoid skewing data in order to match a predetermined outcome that aligns with a particular agenda, such as a political or moral point of view. Although subjectivity is likely in almost any sociological study, with careful consideration, a good sociologist can limit its effect on any particular study. 


https://www.boundless.com/sociology/sociological-research/ethics-in-sociological-research/value-neutrality-in-sociological-research/

It appears to be quite debated, though. With feminists, marxists and interpretivists on the ""yay bias"" side, and old school sociologists and more right wing critics on the other."

The Notion of Truth in Buddhism by Dr. Paul Fuller

An excellent (detailed, lengthy) article, by a truly brilliant scholar of Buddhism, on what ""truth"" is in Buddhism, includes a quote by W.C. Smith about the way Christian religion dominates our perception of what a religion is:

""The peculiarity of the place given to belief in Christian history is a monumental matter, whose importance and relative uniqueness must be appreciated. So characteristic has it been that unsuspecting Westerners have [...] been liable to ask about a religious group other than their own […] ‘What do they believe?’ as though this were the primary question, and certainly were a legitimate one.’""

Switching majors is only going to delay the inevitable. The problem isn't the major--it's you. If you switch to an easier major, yes, you will likely pass and get a degree. And you might *MIGHT* get a job (doubtful, as there will be 1000 very smart people competing for it). But if you're a lazy asshole, you're going to be fired from that job.

You know what the problem is. Stop being a lazy asshole. If you can't do that at college, then take a break from college and go out into the working world. Learn some job skills. Actually work for a living. Because right now, you have the problem that a lot of privileged kids have--you've never paid for anything and you don't know the value of work.

I still use Opera 12, but it is slowly becoming not worth using as the web continues to move forward and Opera 12 does not. I still rage about not being able to open more than 1 closed tab when I'm not using it, and believe it or not I actually use and love the email client.

I'll be migrating to Chromium. I still have a thin shimmer of hope that they'll actually turn the chrome opera into a really good feature-loaded browser, but they have come out and said they don't care about half the features that made me love it originally.

The rule I learned, was you have to wait the time that they were dating. (extra time if &lt;1 year)

6 months-1 year: round up to 1 year

3-6 months: + 6 months

&lt; 3 months: + 3 months

(Extra time may be required due to the severity of the breakup)

Then you must ask your friend, if he would be alright if you dated her. He should return your respect, by saying yes, however he is well within his rights to answer no.

Should he say no, you have to make a choice, between the woman, and your bro. When in doubt remember the golden rule, ""Bros before Hoes."""

""Defy me, and you will know what it is to stand against a God."" - Vivec

""[Being a God] is like being a juggler. Things are always moving, and you learn to know where they are without even thinking about it. Only there are many, many things moving. And sometimes, like any juggler, you drop something. I'm afraid it has become a lot more a matter of dropping things lately. There's too much to do, and not enough time, and I'm losing my touch. Perhaps I'm growing old. It is a bit like being at once awake and asleep. Awake, I am here with you, thinking and talking. Asleep, I am very, very busy. Perhaps for other gods, the completely immortal ones, it is only like that being asleep. Out of time. Me, I exist at once inside of time and outside of it. It's nice never being dead, too. When I die in the world of time, then I'm completely asleep. I'm very much aware that all I have to do is choose to wake. And I'm alive again. Many times I have very deliberately tried to wait patiently, a very long, long time before choosing to wake up. And no matter how long it feels like I wait, it always appears, when I wake up, that no time has passed at all. That is the god place. The place out of time, where everything is always happening, all at once."" - Vivec

""After I kill you, I will rape your corpse. Don't worry, I'll be gentle."" - Anhaedra

""Come Nerevar, friend or traitor come. Come and look upon the Heart and Akulakhan. And bring Wraithguard, I have need of it. I will continue to draw divine power from the Heart and distribute it to my kin and followers. I will continue to broadcast divine power upon the blight winds, so that it will touch each soul in Vvardenfell, and then more broadly, across the waters to the rest of Morrowind and Tamriel. In time, every mortal in Tamriel shall feel the liberating contact with the divine. This is the end. The bitter, bitter end."" - Dagoth Ur"

I tried looking it up, too, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of easily accessible literature on how to avoid being intimidating.

If I had to hazard a guess of my own, I'd say if you're in a situation that isn't ""I definitely want you to have sex with me"" make it explicitly clear by telling them that saying ""no"" is perfectly fine- That's what a previous bf of mine did. Or you could talk it through beforehand like ""So uh... do you wanna (whatever) sometime?"" in a situation she'd feel safe talking about it in, or otherwise not in the heat of the moment.

I don't know... but do go to [r/askwomen](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen) if you're interested, I'm sure it would make a very interesting topic."

That kind thing is not grounds to ditch her entirely, but you should have been prepared to walk away instead of getting all attached. All those texts afterwards, especially the ones asking her why she didn't respond, demonstrated extreme neediness, which promptly killed what little attraction she may or may not have had in the first place.

Not everyone finds their passion in college. Some people get out and work twenty years in a field (sick or not) without any freaking clue what they actually like doing. The answer isn't to give up, it's to keep trying new things. She doesn't have to think that she is a failure for not having a job she loves. She should be taking elective classes on the side, exploring volunteer opportunities, and taking advantage of her free time to learn new hobbies and activities that will bring happiness into her life. 

Unfortunately depression can go hand in hand with multiple sclerosis, and not everyone is able to cope. She may need to take up counseling or depression medication along with her MS therapies. There are a lot of associations out there connected with MS that have support groups and all sorts of resources available for free, all she needs to do is register.

Things you can do:

Be supportive (derp). Recognize that with a disease like MS, there will not always be a constant path forward in her life. It's a three steps forward, two steps back kind of process (for a lot of people that I've talked with), and the feeling of being inadequate or lazy is EXTREMELY difficult to deal with. I remember limping out my research sites this spring and feeling like the most useless tool in the box because bending over to collect samples once a day was exhausting all of my energy. Not to mention that now I have this irrational fear that I'm going to have a horrific relapse that puts me in a wheelchair at any moment.

I hope that you can encourage her to keep trying and keep fighting, because if she doesn't then she really will have failed. It might help to highlight the things she has achieved with her life that you find admirable, because sometimes people don't recognize those things themselves.

Definitely recommend counseling for her, and perhaps shared sessions for you both. Perhaps you can both figure out what kind of dynamic picks her up instead of letting her slide down the depression hill."

thekillerinstincts,relationships,1390865997.0,"It doesn't sound like your aunt has fully accepted the inevitability of death, for herself or for others. It's very, very delusional for someone to argue that someone with a terminal illness could have been ""saved"" from dying. How long does she imagine he could have lived if anything had been done differently? 

Death is very scary, but at some point we have to accept that we're not actually immortal. Take heart from the fact that you, at 18, are already far enough along on your emotional journey that you were able to help your father through his passage. What you did was beautiful.

Your aunt is to be pitied, but she doesn't get a free pass for what she's doing. Grief is grief, but she is attacking you. Not only is she accusing you of wanting your own father to die, which is *heinous*, she is forcing you to feel the kind of desperation and anxiety she is feeling. It's abusive and wrong and you should be protected from it.

 What's more, she's making *someone else's death* completely about her. It sounds like she wants to be recognized as the most grieving-est relative of all, when really you were the closest to your dad. Does she have a history of stealing the spotlight like this, or of being jealous when you get attention? If she's a narcissist (check out /r/raisedbynarcissists to see some common behaviors) it may be best to eschew contact completely. Indeed, if she says she'll never speak to you again, you may want to take that for the gift it is.

Best of luck to you. You did a WONDERFUL service for your father and you deserve nothing but gratitude for that."

&gt;She was astounded by the fact that I'd even question her on anything. Which is completely understandable

No, no, it isn't. That's derailing. That's gaslighting. It's okay that she was surprised that you asked, but a good communicator will NOT say ""I can't believe you are asking that!"" She made HER upset and YOUR mistake the central issue -- derailment. 

 A good response would have been ""I understand why what I did was hurtful and I'm sorry. I will not do that again and I ask you to forgive me."" Anything less than that should be met with suspicion, I think.

Now, I don't know how much you might suck at communicating - maybe you genuinely made her feel offended. You should take a look back on what you actually said and did, and make sure it wasn't outrageous (and maybe add it to your post, if there are more details).

Good on you for realizing that you can't expect great communication while drunk; sounds like you should talk about it again when you're sober. Perhaps you can bring it up calmly when you're alone and both sober, and simply say ""I need to talk to you about the way you spoke to me the other night. I know we were both drunk and I was jealous, and I'm willing to talk about other ways I can express myself; but I need you to know just how hurtful it is that you felt comfortable berating me at the drop of a hat.

ProtoKun7,gallifrey,1390866840.0,"I like the self-contained style to an extent, and it also adds a special factor to the companions that stuck around across regenerations. It's nice to have some interconnection, but it shouldn't be *too* interconnected. If characters from Ninth's and Tenth's era had kept turning up to see Eleventh, it wouldn't have felt like the show was moving on at all and was still trying to drag everything along with it.

I hope the stakes for regeneration or the departure of a companion don't keep escalating too high though. Regeneration episodes should definitely have high enough stakes to be fatal for the Doctor, but we don't need another example of destroying Dalek ships with it. As for companions, it's perfectly OK for them to be normal people and people who choose to leave rather than being wrenched away. Now, I hope Clara stays for a long time yet, don't get me wrong, but when she finally does leave, it would be nice to have her just decide to go rather than be subjected to some massively unfortunate disaster."

Plenty of people talk freely about their previous relationship**s** (most people have several) with their partners. You don't have to give out gory details, and you certainly don't have to talk constantly about your exes, keep pictures of them or keep in contact with them, but it shouldn't be a subject that's completely off limits. Sorry, friend, that isn't OK.

It isn't fair that you aren't *her* first and yet she's angry that she isn't yours (wth?) She says that the experience was traumatic and coerced, and that may be 100% true; indeed, you should trust that it is, since that's probably a huge reason for her reaction here. But it doesn't matter; both of you should be free to bring your lives and past experiences to the table together.

Your past makes you *you*. If she wants a you that never had another girlfriend, she doesn't want *you*.

And, sorry for the cliche, but this kind of thing can only really be an issue for folks as young as you. Once you're 35 and dating, being upset because you aren't someone's first is pretty laughable.

Talk to her at a neutral time and place -- not in bed, not when she's upset, just over coffee or something -- and tell her you're concerned that she gets so upset at the idea that you were ever with someone else. Simply tell her that

- you can't change your past
- you wouldn't *want* to change your past
- you love her and have chosen to be with her
- but she can no longer speak to you the way she has been
- because *you respect yourself* and she's not treating you well
- and if she can't treat you with more respect, you're out.

Stay calm, be compassionate while you speak, and don't lay down like a dog. If she blows this up into a huge fight, you know the truth: she's a drama queen. At that point, it's safe to DTMFA."

But, the reason why the current competitive meta has an ADC/support bot lane is because that's the strongest duo lane from a gold efficiency pov; you take the role with the highest gold scaling and pair it with the role with the lowest gold scaling.  Then, you pick champs that can lane relatively safely vs other strong picks and go from there.  People like to overstate the ability of APCs, assassins and bruisers to dive the backline but the truth is properly executed teamfights will allow an ADC to do a fuckton of damage once they start building the highly synergistic ADC ""core"" items.  It's far from the only way to play but it's effective enough that no team has come up with a consistently better strategy, yet.

The subjective answers *can* be true for women. But virginity, and the meanings/values associated with it, is a very complex and multi-faceted thing which is not the same in every society, nor for every woman. Nor does one woman's sexual behavior mean the same thing as another woman's. You have to know the woman, and where she comes from.

You're slipping all the stitches to the end of the needle so that your garter rows line up, and the beginning/end of the rows are at the edges of the hood. If you simply continued knitting in garter from the center back of the hood, there would be a noticeable jog in the center of each row. 

The simultaneous increasing/decreasing makes the hood opening wider, so you can put a face in it, while making more room in the back of the hood. You're reading that section of the pattern incorrectly, you'll be working decreases and increases on the same row (so on RS rows k2tog, k to 1st before marker, m1, k1, sl marker, k1, m1, k to last 2 sts, k2tog, then just knit all the way across on the WS) "

Imagining the links between subreddits, if you just had interest-based ones then the links would be linear - there'd be no links between wildly-disparate interest groups. This would encourage insularism within groups of interests, with little interaction of their members with ones of other groups. Format-based subs will link far more easily with a much wider set of other subs, meaning that we aren't cutoff from people with different views from ourselves, encouraging a more egalitarian community."

teralaser,sailing,1390867948.0,"I rented a ton of times from the [FSCC](http://www.floridasailing.com), when the late Howard Huntsberry operated it as a ""bareboat"" exchange.  
Basically I rented (""exchanged"") a fairly beat-up boat from 27 to 47ft or a cat (depending on no of people), shared the cost at 20-40$ each, and sailed for an afternoon or afternoon-evening (due to no wind in the morning in FL).  
The boat shouldn't be docked too weirdly or inaccessible. It shouldn't be possible to overrev the engine if possible. No gas inboard engines - also seemed like a bad idea. Make a little manual with drawings of docking lines and how to start and end a sail (e.g. ""close windows!"" etc.), also put a full inventory list in there (I remember looking in the manual, when the steering wheel cable broke on a boat ""Oh? it says there is an emergency tiller somewhere!

Contrary to popular belief, one person being a dick sometimes doesn't give everyone else the right to be a dick back to them. In fact, in order to foster good communication, *somebody* has to get off the the dick-cycle and say ""OK, let's talk, we've both hurt each other, what's going on, life is short, I love you.""

Passive-aggressive BS is going to happen. So, OK, you were grumpy, and she was horrendous. The ball's in your court. You get to open up a new door for communication here. But stay vigilant - if she really ""beat you down"" and ""berated you"" in an ""onslaught"" (that's violent imagery, guy!) you gotta realize that's a big abusive red flag.

It would be better if you were blunt about it, communication is one of the most important things, in a relationship.  "
thekillerinstincts,relationships,1390868285.0,"Of course you still care about her. Look, falling in love and then getting your heartbroken at your age doesn't happen because you didn't find the right person to be with forever and ever. It happens because it's an incredibly important formative experience. You're supposed to fall in love, and then you're supposed to feel the desperate confusion of feeling deep love and superficial lust for another at the same time, and then you're supposed to feel heartbreak. It totally sucks, but you need to experience it.

It's extremely unlikely that you're going to find one person in your early twenties and stay with them until your *death*. You're not the same person from year to year, much less from decade to decade. 

Are you planning to marry this person? It's possible to have a good marriage when you're young, but that marriage also might end. In fact, it almost certainly will. Because people change. And that doesn't mean the relationship failed, it means you grew out of it. Some people are able to do that amicably, others aren't.

Just end it."

Floppyboobsack,TrueAskReddit,1390868628.0,"On the internet (meaning reddit) perception is distorted. One reason is people hiding behind a screen so they make horrible comments that they would never dare say in person. Another reason is the demographic here. The demographic matters here because the older you get, the easier it is to get fat. I'm not talking about the old ""metabolism slowing down"" bit, I'm talking about how over time just eating a few hundred extra calories per day can add up. Along with this, as you age you are more likely to become more sedentary for whatever reason. So it's easier for younger people to be judgemental about being fat because they haven't encountered it yet. They don't get how all the advertising, processed carb garbage and fast food in your face 24/7 can really have an impact especially as time goes on. People can't really empathise with something they haven't experienced.

I truly believe food can be like a drug. The difference is, drugs aren't advertised on TV or available on every corner legally, and fat is shown on your body. You can be a drunk or video game addict and people on the street wouldn't know, but fat is obvious so it's easy to label people. You can essentially just quit other bad behaviours, but losing fat is also a physical process.

People that ""hate"" fat people can't relate to the problem and don't want to understand it. Why can't they just quit eating that food? Why are they so lazy? I guess it makes them feel superior. I personally don't think it is right to judge these people at all, because everyone has had different experiences with life and has developed different coping mechanisms.

Anyway, leatherstraightjacket comes to meet my friend, but leatherstraightjacket was not as described.  Although the person was about 18 and had lots of piercings and was pretty ""emo"", leatherstraightjacket was a girl!  Apparently she was posing as a guy for the same reason some guys pose as girls on games like world of warcraft; neopets was mostly female, and by being ""male"", she got way more attention and people would give her items and stuff like that.  For whatever reason, my friend was not upset about this, and they hung out for a few hours before my friend's mom came and picked her up.  Then leatherstraightjacket drove home and they kept in touch via aim.  They're facebook friends now and still keep in touch!

Oh, and both of them got lifetime IP bans from neopets, because arranging to meet someone else is a HUGE no-no given that the site has lots of kids and allowing that sort of thing would make it a child predator magnet."

daisyismydog,Indiemakeupandmore,1390868884.0,"Hi Karen! I think one of the best ways to experiment with makeup is through indie brands. If you're trying to build a palette that you'll REALLY love I wouldn't recommend limiting yourself right off the bat to trying to dupe XYZ palette from a mainstream brand unless you know for sure that you would use and love every single color. Instead, I'd try out a ton of different colors (often sample or mini sizes will be available) to find out ones that you know absolutely work for you and then pressing a palette out of those ones. 

Silk Naturals has dupes of all the Naked palettes and a ton of popular shades from mainstream brands (NARS, MAC, etc.) so if there's a particular shade you've been lusting after I would try them. I'm not sure how shipping is to Ireland for them though :/ Generally some brands that might be cheap shipping in the US can jump a bit shipping int'l but Victorian Disco Cosmetics and Shiro Cosmetics both have flat rate shipping ($6.00 and $7.50 respectively I believe). Darling Girl Cosmetics has a ton of neutrals (side note: the taupe section is unbelievable and they have a color similar to Laura Mercier's African Violet) and I believe they also try to accommodate international folks by shipping in sample bags to reduce the shipping cost.

The series takes place on The Disc, a flat world that is balanced upon the backs of four  giant elephants. Those four, in turn, are riding the back of a colossal sea-turtle as it swims though the stars. Across the forty books in the series, many characters are featured and followed as they adventure. My favorite character in the series is Death. *That* Death. He's absolutely brilliantly written. Easily became my favorite portrayal of the Pale Horseman in any media I've ever seen."

7. She doesn't respond to you - don't you think she would if she were interested?

I... actually object mildly to referring to the main character with a male pronoun.

&gt;Have you ever read the short story My Mother's Clothes: The School of Beauty and Shame?

I haven't... although I've lived coming to terms with being trans. Some of my main character's story is drawn directly from my own, other parts of her story are constructed from the stories I've heard from other people. To some extent, of course, all of it is original, especially in the interaction between parts of her narrative.

I'm considering writing a whole story around this, although I've done something similar for NaNoWriMo... although I think this character is actually a better character than the one I tried to write the novel for NaNoWriMo around."
rowdygentleman,Jeep,1390870072.0,"I'm at 24,000 miles and have zero complaints. 

The 3.8L was based off of the 3.3L Chrysler engine; essentially a 3.3L bored out to a 3.8L. These engines were in production for 21 years until they were ultimately replaced by the 3.6L Pentastar engine. Given the longevity and production numbers, there's no real drawbacks to this engine aside from output and fuel economy. 

However, keep in mind you're driving a Wrangler, a vehicle that's not meant to be relatively fast or economical. Also, changing the gearing can easily fix any complaints of a lack of power from this engine.

We really bonded in 6th grade literature class, mostly screwing around and not taking the assignments seriously. We didn't talk much in grades 7 and 8, but by 9th grade, we were re-united in several classes. We began hanging out together, and realized we really jived. This continued until he moved a state away junior year of high school, but our friendship endured. We eventually attended the same university sophomore year of college, and roomed together. He's married and lives in another country now, but we talk and visit often enough.

I think our common interests brought us together. We loved a lot of the same video games, music, movies, books, etc. We also really know how to not take things seriously and have a great time. We also have great convos about serious topics, like philosophy, politics, and religion.

Ingmundar,changemyview,1390870969.0,"Not a bad idea, but it's just way too hard to enforce and there would be a multiplicity of loopholes in such a system. As the top comment points out, your system would probably result in the rules of incorporation being bent or used to guarantee assets (i.e this isn't ""my"" car this is a ""company"" car). It's also a rather aggressive thing to enforce. You would need a way to audit the total assets controlled by a single person and be able to separate this out from the assets of their spouse, dependents, company, etc. You would then also need to bring them to court and then find some mechanism to force them to sell. Like would the court dictate what you have to sell or when you have to sell it by? Would this court recognize things like depreciation (i.e yea that car cost 100k but with depreciation it's more like 60k now)? Would non-cash assets just be seized by the government at random?

Because this system deviates so much from what we have now it would be massive, complicated and difficult to enforce. And when something is difficult to enforce loopholes spring up and the enforcement tends to become more lax. I think a better idea is to simply work with in existing structures like tax law. A higher top marginal tax rate, corporate tax rate, E.I payment, etc. would have a similar effect without changing the system significantly."

* For a cider I am partial to woodchuck.
* For a n00b to the beer scene I HIGHLY recommend ""Wild Blue"" a blue berry lager with 8% alc
* Arrogant Bastard is and amazing IPA (India Pale Ale)
* For a dark beer, Mississippi Mud is delicious but hard to find, so play around with a few Black and Tan Lagers till you find what you like. Anything from Germany that is dark will usually be amazing. Fat tire is also great.
* I'm not a huge fan of Pillsners, but I do enjoy ""Yella Pills""
* Scotch ale I have to give it up to Old Chub, same company who makes Yella Pills. Good stuff.
* My favorite pale ale is Rolling Rock, but some people hate the skunky tone. I'd say Dale's Pale Ale (Same guys who make old chubb) is another popular choice.
* The popular Belgium Style (Means fermented with orange peel and citrus notes) is Blue moon. The rest of the ""moon"" beers are disapointing but blue moon is a classic.
* for Mead get what ever is local. I've yet to taste a bad local mead and yet to taste a good Bottled mead.
* Milk stout is an interesting milk stout worth trying. Guiness is usually the standard all stouts are held to.
* Stone brewing company does excellent smoked porters. (They Make Arrogant Bastard)
* For a good Boch I HIGHLY recommend sam adams double boch. 12% alch so don't get discouraged it comes in a 4 pack
* Sam adams is also my choice for Variety pack makes. They mess up now and again but 95% of their beer is excellent.

Zeydon,Gaming4Gamers,1390871413.0,"If you're not in the game development program, then what ARE you doing there?  If it is QA, then I will tell you straight up that you don't need any formal training to get an ENTRY LEVEL job in QA.  If you want a higher-up QA position, learning how to write automation would be very helpful.  Learn programming languages and you could be an SDET.  I've worked in QA for a number of years, and at one company did see a number of folks be promoted from QA to designer who busted their asses, putting in a lot of hours learning the tools for no pay.  Did they get paid better than QA once they moved to design? Only if you don't count all their unpaid OT (which there is a lot of).  Were they paid as well as designers with more coding experience? Hell no.  Is moving from QA to design rare in the industry? Absolutely; it doesn't even happen at that company I used to work for anymore.

If you want to make games, learn a programming language or two and make something yourself that you can put on a resume/portfolio that you can be proud of.  It is, as you say, a very competitive field and a degree from some gaming school won't amount to jack shit if you can't back it up with hard evidence that you got talent.

If the schooling motivates you to acquire programming skills that are actually in demand then it's not a waste, otherwise, be prepared to have your hopes dashed.  I've seen more than my fair share of QA with designer aspirations not go anywhere because they're naive about the investment involved.  Game design is so much more than having ""good"" ideas about what constitutes good gameplay - we all have opinions on that.


TL; DR: Learn programming languages or don't fucking bother."

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390871893.0,"""Okay, so , I guess I want to hear from (compassionate) people, should I be satisfied with this? Would you be?""

I can't tell you how you should feel, but it's clear you're not satisfied with this.  I certainly wouldn't be, either. My husband isn't quite as old as your boyfriend, but he's just a few years from 40, and has a normal to high libido.  

I often tell younger women who are with guys over 40 that they have to acknowledge the reality of how the male libido does change with age, but they're usually baffled that 3-5 times a day when they first hooked up has gone down to once a week or so.  His libido ISN'T normal at his age, and is probably quite likely related to the health issues you mention.

But the reason doesn't matter if he's not willing to do anything about it, and it doesn't sound like he is.

I know things aren't great out there for single women in their 40s, but I still bet you could find someone great who would love what you have to offer.  I wouldn't stay for fear of being alone, because nothing is lonelier than feeling alone when you have a partner.

Also, maybe a new therapist is in order?  I'm a little concerned that yours seems to be focused on having you stay with someone who doesn't meet your needs."

In 6.79, I didn't actually believe she was OP. In fact, I think a lot of the people complaining weren't necessarily thinking she was way too good, just that she's rather elusive if you don't have great communication and collaboration. As we all know, these are scarce in pubs, especially since teamwork is weaker when you're playing with people who have no idea of your skill, your abilities, or your playstyle.

It will also help lower skilled pub players with dealing with her, since it now rewards players for noticing the minimap and using spiders for vision. 

I do think she should have gotten a small buff or something in return though. I'm all for making heroes less pub-stompy, but I still think the game should be mostly balanced around the highest level of play.

That being said, for the sake of discussion-- they really couldn't do it.

ISIS can't even wait until the fighting stops to start imposing their demented societal views on the populace, and they have to impose these very forcibly, otherwise people would tell them to fuck off or just not comply at all.

Assume that ISIS has 7,000 people in Syria maximum, you would assume that the rest of the people of a similar mind in this hypothetical Al Qaeda Syria would be the ones taking the initiative in regard to ""capturing Jerusalem for the Caliphate"".

I guess the stats would be different if we're assuming that the ""Islamic state of Syria"" is run by the hard Salafi Jihadi groups, which do have more in the way of manpower, but then you also have to take into account a host of other things, most prominently possible infighting and other groups from all over the spectrum continuing to fight the people who proclaimed Syria as some puritanical Salafist theocracy."

As someone who's ended up being involved with a LOT of house purchases and renovations as I, my parents, and my friends have moved to follow careers, seeing significant un-permitted work in a jurisdiction that requires permits is a big red flag. I basically plan to re-do anything I see was done without a permit, and deduct the cost of re-doing it from what I'm willing to pay for the house. And when I first move into a house, every wall gets scanned with a tool that's *supposed* to tell me where electrical wires and pipes and such are, and all kinds of holes end up getting punched in drywall so that I can take a peek inside with my inspection scope.

Incidentally, the KJV translates it the same way--they're ""fishers"" who become ""fishers of men"".

The Syriac (an early translation of the NT into a dialect of Aramaic) does the same thing, with calling them ṣyd' ""fishers"" who can become ṣyd' dbny 'nš' (fishers of humans).  However, that word for ""fisher"" isn't attested in Jewish Aramaic (it means ""hunter"" or ""trapper""), using the root dg instead.  But the pun would still exist.

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1390872402.0,"Why do guys think $100,000 cars impress quality women?  I'll never understand that.  They might attract a certain type of woman, but generally not the type you want to settle down with.

Anyway, I don't expect you to react well to my advice because you're not reacting well to anyone's advice, but here's mine: you're still acting like the insecure nerd.  You may not look like that anymore, and you may have been able to fake confidence to get laid and married, but it's clear you don't actually have that confidence.  You've heard ""Fake it til you make it"", right?  Well there should have been a point where the faking confidence turned into REAL confidence.

You don't say what you've done to try to fix the DB.  She may be LL, but she was previously HL.  How do you seduce her?  Do you act confidently around her?  You're convinced something is wrong with you and go into a negative self talk spiral and get insecure - well, that's not sexy.  You need to act with your wife as you did that got her attracted to you in the first place!

If her LL isn't fixable then yes, you should leave.  Your excuses are bullshit.  Early 30s is NOT too old to ""start over"" for fuck's sake.  Men have an easier time in the dating market the older they get (to a point - a point you're decades away from).  You say you live in an area that's bad to date in - then MOVE.  You can afford a $100,000 car, you can afford to move. Who cares if you're the first to divorce in your family?  Who cares if you have herpes?  I know lots of people who have herpes who get laid regularly.

Stop making excuses and start taking action, first to try to fix your DB situation and if that doesn't work, to get out."

LeBatEnRouge,AskWomen,1390872448.0,"I met an internet friend IRL not on purpose. I used to chat in chat rooms long ago and was in a regional chat. In my early 20s with a lame job that required little-to-no work, I had plenty of time to gab with all the room regulars. I took a liking to one particular reg who was funny and scathing and a little troll-ey as any room reg should be. Of course daily life is a regular topic so I learned a bit about her, and she did with me. Except I used a fake name and altered a few key parts of my life because. Well. It was a chat room. 

Anyway. Fast forward to a few years later and I'm hanging out with a really good friend of mine and she's like ""Oh you have yo meet my awesome friend, 'rather unique name', you guys would totally hit it off!"" 

Sure as shit, I meet her at a party and we start talking and hitting it off. Husbands name? The same. Kid? Same. Random Jewish stepfather she hates? Same. SO WEIRD!

So after several times hanging out, we become FB friends and she is in a public group that is basically ""RIP Old Chatroom Name"". 

Tripped me out. She still doesn't know. I feel like at first I didn't tell her because it would have been weird. NOW so much time has passed that it would be weird for another reason. o_O"

As for the lawsuit, I think there is merit to it. Imagine the accident involved an actual taxicab whose driver is looking for his next customer. Even though he is not currently earning any money, he's still on shift and working for his company. Is it reasonable to assume the company is at fault for the accident? Imagine if this occurred when the driver is returning the cab to the company's garage. Is the company liable then?

I don't know much about Uber. You can push a button to say you're available to take fares, you can toggle it off, too. You can ask for a ride, and if an Uber driver is close by he'll come and get you. How does that differ from a cab company in terms of the law? Should Uber, its drivers, and their vehicles be treated the same as taxicab companies, their drivers, and their vehicles under municipal and state law?

I think you're still overreacting a bit here. Yes, flying vision counters her quite hard. Other heroes in the game have counters. However, almost no hero is 100% shut down by their counter. This is probably going to be the same with broodmother. Yes, bounty can track you and make it easy for his team to deal with you. You're thinking about it in the wrong way.

Instead of saying ""Bounty counters brood, she can do nothing at all on the whole map the whole game"" and stifling discussion, try to figure it out. How do you play against a bounty hunter as brood in 6.80? Well, there's no way he's going to 1v1 you. Almost no hero is going to do that, unless they burst you down from full to zero. Also, if Bounty is around you, then he's not planning to track the rest of your team. So, the enemy team is going to have to dedicate at least two heroes to kill you. The solution then, is to play extra careful. Do you see four heroes on the map elsewhere? Push and don't be afraid. Use spiders for vision. In short, play smart. 

Is playing broodmother going to be more difficult? Sure. I highly doubt it's going to be the end of the world, though."

This build is overclockable, and is set up to overclock well. It also has a 4gb videocard rather than a 2gb one. These two things mean your system will be able to go for a longer amount of time before being upgraded, because you'll have more VRAM for higher resolutions, and you'll be able to get more out of your CPU. The downside to this is it costs more money, so you end up with a smaller SSD and a shittier (but also smaller) case.

Angry_Apollo,WTF,1390872997.0,"I should clarify that I am an inactive member. Let me address a few of these items:

&gt;you believe that the Bible is the word of God as far as it is translated correctly. That's another way of saying you believe in the bible to the extent that it concurs with the weird machinations of Joseph Smith, a known polygamist and pedophile

I always felt that it was proclaiming that the Bible is scripture, yet admits that the text is not perfect and has been changed over time either through translation error, mistake, or an outright attempt to control people. We do the best with what we have. The King James version is not *our* version. It's a widely accepted version. In the King James version, there is not a single instance where the church would say ""this is incorrect, ignore this part."" We also don't take it literally either. As a matter of fact, the Book of Mormon fits hand-in-hand with the Bible. It is considered a supplement and corroboration of the entire Bible, not just what suits us.

&gt;BUT in answer to your question, a lot of it has to do with the fact that you don't view Jesus as God, but rather a demigod subservient to a being who was once a man.

Kind of. Yes, we believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God. That's a little different than other Christian faiths. But the church is actually named ""The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"". Jesus Christ is in the actual name of the church. Mormons consider him their savior who  died on the cross for everyone's sins and to give us the gift of repentance. Without him, God's eternal plan would not work. How can you tell me that my savior is not Jesus Christ, that I am not Christian, when everything we live for is by him?

My digression: Joseph Smith did some strange things that I honestly can't explain. Some of his marriages to very young women are actually in the church records. I can't condone any of that. Almost all religions have questionable items in their history.

My take from the Mormon church: I honestly can't find the faith to commit to the religion. With that said, you will find really great people in the church. Everybody contributes to the common goal. You will find a church that is wise and responsible with their money, that lead one of the greatest humanitarian efforts by any private organization, and leadership that accepts no salary all the way from the top to the bottom. I know this doesn't have anything to do with your comments, but I thought I would share my admiration for the church, religion aside."
lukewarmpork,Military,1390873001.0,Damn that shit was cool as fuck. Reminds me of the Volvo videos with semi's but even cooler. 
FreyjaSunshine,medicine,1390873002.0,"I agree 100% about your panel scenario.  It would make so much sense, but since lawyers control the courts and government, and lawyers profit from the current system, I don't expect to see any changes.

Recording surgeries?  I'm not sure.  I work in one that has a camera already.  There are sterility issues, and privacy issues.  We already do things that are completely unnecessary to cover our asses - would surgeons start doing things that were not in a patient's best interest because of outside interference?  Would outcomes be better, or would the recordings just provide lawyers with more fodder to bring cases that have no merit other than that some protocol wasn't followed?  Would insurers start using them to find more reasons not to pay us?  Who would have access to all these recordings?  Patients?  Insurers?  Administrators?  Consultant physicians?  What happens when a patient gets a copy of his surgery and posts it on youtube?   That could violate the surgeon's privacy.  Would a surgeon be required to narrate the surgery for the benefit of the recording to clear up any ambiguity?

Shit happens in ORs.  Things get dropped.  Tempers flare.  Profanity is uttered.  Surgery isn't pretty, and at times it's downright brutal.  Would recordings be misinterpreted by people who don't really know what they are looking at?  To see some pediatric anesthesia inductions, you'd think we were murdering the child, because toddlers can scream and fight (but not for long) and you can't reason with them.  It looks horrible, but getting the kid anesthetized quickly is actually kinder and safer than avoiding a fuss (in the unreasonable ones) and prolonging the process.

I imagine that most surgeons would be opposed to it, even though it could potentially help them in malpractice cases.  There was a bit of a backlash when surgeons were required to mark the surgical site (""Patients will think I don't know what I'm doing!"") but now it's commonplace.  Maybe they would get used to it.  Some would probably ham it up for the camera.

We all make mistakes.  Many mistakes can be easily corrected, and no harm is done.  Surgeons cut the wrong thing because every body is different, and stuff can look like other stuff.  If it's recognized and repaired, no harm is done.   Would patients and lawyers pore over surgical recordings to look for errors that cold precipitate a lawsuit?  It costs an average of about $30,000 to successfully defend a suit if you do nothing wrong, so think of all the people who could sue for $25,000 and get a settlement just to avoid a trial?  That happens a lot now, just think of the potential, and if you don't believe me, watch some lawyers' TV ads (""Have you been treated for X?  You could be due a settlement!"") and just imagine what the bottom feeders could be capable of.

I think recording surgeries would be a double edged sword, and is a can of worms that we might not want to open.  Even if started for a noble reason, it would be subject to misuse.

Wow, that was long."
JTfromOKC,videos,1390873017.0,"You know...here at the OKC Zoo they have a great lion exhibit with a huge wall of plexiglass that's about 12' high.  You get to stand nose to nose with these apex predators and only about a few inches of plastic separating you. 

I have watched nature shows my whole life and still love them to this day but I'll never forget standing there, face to face with a male lion.  The TV cannot accurately convey the size of these animals.  He was only about 1 to 1.5 feet shorter than me....if that.  I'm 6'1"" and we were almost standing eye to eye.

Looking at his massive paws and his sheer size and weight I realized if this animal wanted to eat me, I'm done.

I think I prefer someone who is down the middle or leans towards being an extrovert.

Networkian,Reformed,1390873842.0,"Funny you should bring this up - I was actually asked a bunch of questions along these lines a few days ago! A couple of bros and I were out fishing, and passing the time by picking each other's brains on a variety of curly theological questions (predestination, transubstantiation, justification vs sanctification, etc). I probably have a slight theological edge over the others (simply due to having read a bit more widely), but I was very encouraged by how biblically they approached the issues. During a lull in conversation, one of them came up with a few questions related to demonic activity.

I wish I could remember them in detail! - the obvious question that I recall was ""whether or not people can still be possessed nowadays"". We sort of agreed that as the devil is still allowed some degree of freedom on this earth (under God's sovereignty of course), that meant it was certainly possible.

Unfortunately, I didn't have a better answer. My usual references are CARM and GotQuestions.org, but a book on this subject would be great! OP: it's a hefty undertaking, but if well done and biblically sound, would be of great benefit to many. May God bless your efforts!

On that note, does anyone have any decent book recommendations on the topic of demonic activity? Or even if it's reliably covered in part of a systematic theology? Thanks (and sorry for rambling!)"

ajdeemo,DotA2,1390875008.0,"&gt; No. This ""valid counterplay"" 100% kills her without effort. By the press of a button.

This reeks of the same logic that I once used as an argument that invisibility heroes were completely 100% countered by detection.

Yes, you need sentries and dust to counter such heroes, but there's also the opportunity cost of forcing the enemy team to buy those things. You can't have vision everywhere, gem is risky, and there's obviously more you have to do than just using the item button. 

Likewise, brood forces an opportunity cost on the enemy team. If they're constantly roaming her lane, her team has free roam to get objectives. If they leave, she can freely do what she likes. If she's lax in judgment, she will be punished. 

Not to mention, plenty of heroes with flying vision already did okay against her. Beastmaster destroyed trees, and so did Bat. But when you have Slardar or bounty hunter, it's kind of stupid that she can simply sit in the trees if you don't have another hero that can destroy them. That means you often have to draft not one, but two counters against her if you want to catch her, especially if someone banned the best ones. I still stand by my statement of her not being OP in 6.79, but some abilities are just too good even if the hero isn't head and shoulders above the competition. Web was one of them.

But like I said, why don't we see what the patch actually plays out as? I'm sure you remember how plenty of people freaked out at every new bloodseeker change or Aghs addition, claiming it would become part of the metagame."

I am no scientist, but I think the reason for this is that the upper body weight is putting pressure on the lower back in one direction and the friction of the bottoms on the seat is providing a counteracting, coupling, force. 

This cushion should instead decline backwards (the whole seat looking somewhat vaguely like the letter V, only the angle being, of course, much broader).

I mean the sorts of people who are calling the army ""the enemy of (our version of) Islam"", who thought that there should be a ""holy war"" against the Shia'as and Alawis in Syria, and who in general are all about sectarianism and think anyone who doesn't think like them is evil and a scumbag?

There are plenty of ways that the technocratic elements of the MB screwed up, and abiding or turning a sort-of-blind eye to these people-- avowed salafi jihadis or people who hold Zawahiri in high regard-- was a big part of it."

You're not being asked for permission with regard to the mobile data, and you won't be asked for permission when they go after things you wouldn't give permission for.  Does that clear it up?

The issue is not that they are spying on you, or me, or any single individual.  The issue is that they are spying on everyone and storing that data indefinitely.

Some day, maybe you decide to enter politics or become a judge, and someone decides your opponent would better serve their interests - so damaging information about you is leaked to the press during your campaign.  Or, maybe you win election and something really important comes up - and you get a phone call from someone who says... ""remember back in 2009 when you did XYZ?  It might wreck your career if that information got out.  Of course that won't happen if you vote/rule in such and such a way""

...or maybe the above doesn't happen to you because you never go into politics or the judicial system - but it *does* happen to the people who do, and you end up holding the short end of the stick because they were influenced into doing something they shouldn't have in order to protect themselves.

The only situation without these extreme circumstances is if the enemy gets vision of her if she uses spawn spiderlings from the trees, similar to how ranged units are revealed if they attack from fog.

There is a well-documented psychological phenomenon: when people are presented with factual information that directly contradicts their worldview, it can reinforce that worldview. And belonging to the church constitutes a pretty big fucking worldview. From a simple psychological perspective, cognitive dissonance prevents us from showing people the problems en mass.

What do I do instead? I just drop hints of problems. I bring up semi-scandalous church historical items in conversations about the church, hoping that the person won't know about it and will do more research. I have a fundamental distrust of any organization that is scared of more knowledge, of more information. The amount of obfuscation, half-truths, white-washing, and outright lies that the church employs to hide damaging information makes me furious. However, I don't really know that anyone is in a position to tackle this head on. We have to approach it subtly, from the side.

Most of the people these people attack are Chechens (as it's become relatively rebuilt but far more politically convoluted in Chechnya) or Dagestanis, and not citizens of the Russian Republic.

Yes, there are better ways to bring your cause to prominence-- especially in light of the fact that the Israelis like to pretend (and I'm sure you do as well) that the Munich ""massacre"" was some sort of atrocity to top all atrocities, and that nothing the Israelis did or would do could ever be worse or even condemnable.

lemonylips,AskWomen,1390876912.0,"When I began having sex, I made the decisions 1) to take reasonable steps (birth control) to insure against pregnancy and 2) that I would terminate an unwanted pregnancy outside of some sort of committed life-term relationship where I was financially stable or whatever.  So there really weren't *that* many complicated feelings to deal with when I accidentally got pregnant and needed to get an abortion.

I was 21, I was an unemployed student, I had slept with multiple partners in the window where I could have gotten pregnant, and I had just started dating someone I had not yet slept with.  I didn't tell anyone until after I had made all the proper inquiries and the appointment for the abortion- I didn't think it was anyone's business, I didn't want to unnecessarily worry potential fathers, and I didn't want anyone's opinions involved except for mine.  After all the plans were made, I told my best friend/roommate and the man I had started seeing.  

I wasn't *devastated* about the 'surprise'- I was mostly just annoyed and felt hassled, a bit stressed initially before finding out my insurance covered the whole thing, and slightly embarrassed that I had found myself in this situation.  I knew I would get an abortion, it was a no-brainer kind of situation.  The hardest part was trying to balance that with all the stupid weird sappy hormone fluxes that were happening at the same time.  My body *really* wanted that baby.

Easy improvement #2: have her tease you for a long time before PIV starts. This might help you cum faster. 

Easy fix: if her pussy is sore, ask her to finish you with her mouth. 

Less than ideal: masturbate after she's done. You can make this intimate by doing it while kissing her or cuddling with her. 

The fact that she feels objectified is much more concerning. If she's totally uninterested in sex after she cums and you keep fucking her for much longer, maybe you _are_ objectifying her - but why would she be uninterested in making you feel good?

b00tler,actuallesbians,1390877903.0,"I think you should go easier on yourself--you already have enough to feel shitty about at the moment. What's done is done, and you can't undo it, but there's no reason you need to carry it around and beat yourself up with it. Let that go, and move on to more productive behavior.

As for the jealousy:  Sounds like your ego is out to protect itself. It might feel better in a way to believe she dumped you for someone else. It would be easier to be really angry and think of her as an awful person. It would be easier to believe you are better off without her.  But you can adjust to this new reality and be ok, without having to demonize her.   The reasons why someone doesn't love us romantically are every bit as inexplicable as the reasons why we love in the first place -- but not indicative of our value as people.  Sometimes love just doesn't work out, and that doesn't mean it wasn't real, or right, while it was there. We all grow and change all the time. You may not be able to see it now, but being out of this relationship with someone who doesn't love you the way you want to be loved is going to make room for another, better and more fitting love to come along."

I was approached by several women, early on, and cheating/dating them did cross my mind, because they had the ability to provide the physical intimacy that I wanted so badly. However, I declined, because I do have a sense of honor.

I don't usually harp on mars-vs-venus stereotypes, but this one seems to hold up: guys usually aren't nearly as mortified about social faux pas as women are, likely because they haven't been socialized and shamed to be. Saying, ""stop chewing like that, it's gross,"" to a woman would often make her curl up and hide; but you're not dating a girl.

Both ways of being have upsides. Women are maybe too sensitive... but they very, very rarely have to be told to chew with their mouths closed. Men take faux pas criticism better... but... you'll have to give it, consistently, and probably more than once, which is kind of gross."

See, that is what I am suspicious of.  I don't believe we can expect Jesus and the Christian revelation to be based on the Old Testament.  We shouldn't be reading Jesus through Judaism, we should be reading the Jewish scriptures through Jesus.

&gt;My point was that by the time of the first Council of Nicaea, the religion had drastically changed from its roots in both membership and understanding

Can you demonstrate that, though?  I'm far from extremely educated on the issue, but from what I know, early Christian writings are pretty much unanimous in disagreeing with the Jews, and tend to agree with modern Christianity, save the gnostics and the Arians, who are different issues, but they don't agree with the Jews either - both of them have very divine depictions of Jesus.  There simply isn't any proof that anyone in the ""Jesus movement"" conceived of him as anything other then a deity.

&gt;Using an only-biblical (old testament) understanding of god and rejecting Greek influence, one would logically understand Jesus as he describes himself - the human son of the divine creator.

See, that is a *very* Greek idea, and not one any Jew could accept.  Greek paganism is full of divine sons, many of them prophets, priests, and kings, while there is none of that in the Old Testament."

You say that you can be standing in the same spot as your brother and not see him, but so can you in WoW if you're on separate servers. The difference in ESO is that the game is built from the ground up so that you are never more than a phase change from your friends.  And it's not like an MMO where you only see a few people, the game is built to have hundreds of players in the same area, but with one server you have to divide the population somehow. However, when the game has matured and most players have moved on past the lower level zones, because of the single server there will likely still be a fair amount of players leveling, unlike the ghost towns that are WoW's leveling zones."

Typically if a dachshund wants to fight another dog they won't do things like other dogs (show aggression, attack) they'll role over and pretend to be submissive then they'll try to rip out the other dog's throat. They use the same tactics when playing with other dogs, mine taught a boxer to fight like a dachshund, it came in handy because once the boxer was around two a family in the neighborhood got a dog who they refused to train it (the sons would but they trained it to attack random people) and it would attack the other dogs in the neighborhood. The boxer took it down in no time with the other major players as far as the dogs were concerned watching (mine and an insanely friendly bernese). I guess the news spread and other dogs started to act dominant towards it, a terrier who wasn't there actually responded to seeing that dog by rolling over and then lunging at the air. I'm not going to say that the story spread amongst the dogs but it's a strange coincidence, I personally prefer to think that dogs possess enough of a language to pass that sort of information."

You can say ""no, that's what you think"" all you want, but I've never talked about the ""evil Jews"" or anything like that.

On the Israeli side? Lying on a massive level, misrepresentation of the Palestinian cause to people who don't know anything about the situation, continued historical distortion, and of course the insults. The insults, especially racially/ethnically charged ones, are quite prominent.

&gt; And there is the crux of your position. You can't stand when Jews take their homeland back after two thousand years because we've stopped being submissive to the rest of the world.

Lol, no-- but carry on being self-pitying and deluded and thinking that you're the victim and everyone hates you because ""we reclaimed what's rightfully ours"" or some other delusional garbage like that.

I noticed you're a fan of ""chipmunk"" Bennett. Figures you would like someone like that.

&gt; We no longer will submit to pogroms and expulsions. We no longer submit to being lined up and shot.

&gt; We have our homeland back and we don't actually give a shit if you disapprove.

Ha, youse a tough guy, eh? Still screech loudly and hilariously about the Palestinians not completing the Israeli ethnic cleansing or otherwise refuse to take it in the ass for Israeli actions and policy or otherwise refuse to evaporate like you want them to.

fuzzyllama1,nba,1390880615.0,"Okay I'm gonna break this game down and try to be as unbiased as possible. I'm very sad right now so forgive me if I get a little salty.

The Hawks came to fucking play tonight and there is no doubt about that. They had OKC, the (IMO) best team in basketball on the ropes for most of this game. Our offense was sweet and our passes were crisp. Most people will say OKC's defense looked slow and confused, and that may be somewhat true, but the way our offense operates is setting up quickly out of the inbounds and ball movement all day for every second that shot clock ticks down. The point is to never give the defense a break to make them hustle for every stop and OKC couldn't keep up until the 4th quarter. 

Say what you will about the Hawks franchise, or the fans, or whatever the fuck, but we are a legit fucking team. I mean holy shit we barely lost to OKC with Horford, Teague, and Antic all injured. For those who don't know Hawks basketball those three are incredibly crucial to our team and 2/3 of our best players. We are always out there giving it our all against teams like OKC and Miami trying to prove our worth. Sometimes we win and sometimes we lose, but with a year under our belts this team (at full strength) will be something to look out for you all just fucking watch. 

I love OKC's team to death they are one of my favorite teams to watch and they just know how to close basketball games. Slim Reaper is clutch as fuck there is no denying that (I'll skip over the push for now, because that was bullshit, but whatever he still makes the shots, so I'll give him that).

If you guys can take one thing from this game please let it be that the Hawks can fuck with the big boys and we've been doing it all season. No disrespect to OKC they got the win and they deserve it, but when you talk about it make sure you mention how good the Hawks looked throughout the whole game and how they competed and fought til the last second against a great Thunder team. GG OKC much love.

Notice right after the bite he says, ""Well she has to go to the center.""  That's his dog rehabilitation center where he has a full pack of very natural, normal dogs.  He uses dogs to help heal other dogs and he quite often brings troubled dogs there to help them remember what it's like to be part of a real dog pack.

I've seen him on numerous occasions tell humans to ""not be scared"" and ""don't make direct eye contact"" just ""walk like you belong there or else you might get hurt because these dogs will bite.""  Which surprised me that he would expose non-dog experts to this environment...but here there just in case.

The thing I like about Cesar is he's all about the interaction of energy.  The energy the dog is giving you and what you're giving him/her.  Watch the vid right at [15:25] and Cesar steps out of the RV and says, ""You know the worst part about being bitten is the energy the dog gives you when he bites you.

"
krystyin,personalfinance,1390880926.0,"From another post-solid advice: 
CFP/Tax Preparer here that works with CPA's and Attorneys.
Unless you owe money, the motivation to file would be to obtain your refunds.
Statute of limitatons on refunds is three years from date of filing.
Statute of limitations on taxes due is 10 years.
You can obtain refunds if any are available (and at your bracket they likely are available) for 2012, 2011, 2010. You just missed 2009's refund (deadline date was 04/15/2013, because 2009 filing deadline is 04/15/2010).
You should file if your Income is Greater than your Personal Exemption, in 2012 it was 3800 in 2013 it is 3900 OR if you had income tax withheld (which you must have) OR if you may qualify for a tax credit OR you would like to borrow money for any purpose.
The best way to truly clean this up is a CPA. It will cost you, depending on your state and whether it has an income tax (filing a state income tax return is a separate fee), however it will get done quickly and they will maximize your refunds/returns in those years.
Also, if taxes are due, which they likely aren't, you will want the CPA as power of attorney. You never want to be in a position to speak with the IRS and many self-preparers miss this one big. It doesn't take owning a cash-based business or being a big time millionaire to be audited by the IRS.
I knew a little old lady who's 90 year old mother died. When she died, much cash was left in a safety deposit box that was intended to be given to a charity. Just as it happens, she deposited the cash near the threshhold that triggers warning bells for 'hidden undisclosed' cash, i.e. non-taxed cash or money laundering. It was a transaction that brought scrutiny and the IRS decided to look at the past 3 years of tax returns as a result. When they did, they asked for all of her deductions and supporting docs and could not provide them at the time, thus costing her fees for audit work AND the loss of 3 years of deductions, increasing her tax liability.
Needless to say, if you are going to clean this up AND be married, let someone do this on your behalf for short money. I've cleared UP many people that haven't filed in years and such people often have their whole house out of order, which does not bode well for financial well-being or being a dutiful spouse, partner and care-taker.

Jess_than_three,pics,1390881352.0,"Let's be clear: the idea of ""sending people to the gallows"" is a *complete* mischaracterization of anything I said. I think appropriate punishments for driving drunk should be something like:

* First offense: Lose your license for  six months, and maybe spend a weekend in jail thinking about why what you did wasn't okay. 

* Second offense: Lose your license for a year, and again possibly a little bit (not a ton) of jail time. 

* Third offense: Lose your license permanently, without the possibility of ever getting one again in any state. 

The idea isn't punishment, but rather *prevention*. (Hence why, you know - why bother with jail time if you're taking away the license forever on the third step?) It isn't about branding anyone who has ever driven drunk as A Terrible Person, forever and ever; it's about taking someone who's made an unacceptable and irresponsible and dangerous choice and to reduce the likelihood that they'll do so again in the future. 

So like, take my former coworkers, for example. I kind of think they're idiots, absolutely, and I think they make really shitty decisions. But I don't think they should be locked up forever, and I don't think they need to suffer for their wrongdoing or whatever. I just think that if they can't make the choice not to put others in danger, they shouldn't be allowed to be in a position to have to make that choice. 

Ditto Mr. Bieber. I think he's a douchebag and and a jackass, and I do think he should face real consequences for his illegal and irresponsible (alleged) behavior (if he is indeed found to be guilty). But those consequences shouldn't be *more* severe than those faced by anyone else who does the same thing, and my personal dislike for him has nothing to do with the situation. 

Moreover, if the person in question was a politician I supported, or a favorite actor, or Brandon Sanderson or /u/Shitty_Watercolour, or my best friend or a parent or my son, I'd want the same consequences for them. (*Especially* my son. I sure hope I'll have taught him better than that by the time he's old enough to be able to drive!) 

So basically, I think you might be arguing with a rhetorical opponent who exists in your head, and while she might look a little bit like me, her views don't really seem to be the same as mine. "

Do you have any family that you're close to and care about?  Put that same question to yourself but in the context of that favored loved one.  

I know, I know, dogs are not humans and all that.  But if you watch the whole episode you'll see....this was not any old dog.  They rescued this dog from the pound and raised it.  They loved the dog and it was a part of their family. 

There were numerous scenes where the dog was loving and not aggressive at all and they were all bonding as a family.  This was not some rabid, wild beast they found while hiking the back country and they tried to ""love the wild out of the dog"".  Not by a long shot.

They loved this dog and were truly baffled by how to deal with such aggression.  I honestly feel for them - this dog just had something off in it's psyche - but that doesn't mean it should be put down."

That said, they do have a ""default"" Warden and Hawke, which are used in the absence of player choices (like for the novels and comics). The default Warden is a Dalish Elf who made the Ultimate Sacrifice and the default Hawke is a mage who sided with the mages. I don't think they've stated genders, but I could be wrong about that.

That must feel absolutely horrible and maddeningly frustrating.

I don't have kids, so my advice may be bollocks, but one thing I recommend is not confronting the beliefs head-on. As you've noted, it stresses him out, and he has pre-recorded answers.

What you CAN do is teach him in small ways to think critically about things that are utterly unrelated to the JW beliefs. I can't think of an exact example, but I do this with my nieces all the time. They ask a question and I give an absurd answer. They say ""no way!"" and I ask them questions about what makes them dubious. How do they know I'm lying? And remember, this is about non-religious topics:

""Where's uncle?""

""He had to go sit down - his hamster fell off the wheel.""

""What?!""

""Yeah, inside each person there's a hamster running on a wheel and if the hamster gets tired, we slow down. If the hamster falls off, we have to sit for a while.""

""NO WAY!""

""Are you sure?""

etc…

The point is to raise your son's critical thinking skills in ways that he won't suspect. He's only six now, so he's bound to believe in any sort of silly thing. But by sharpening those critical, rational thought processes, building his ability to distinguish reality from fantasy, then in just a few short years he may realize on his own that the beliefs don't add up.

The good news (ugh!) is that most kids leave the faith eventually, so above all, make sure you let him know you love him and accept him however he is. Many kids that don't leave don't actually believe, but they're afraid of loosing their support structure."

ballookey,exjw,1390881948.0,"&gt; Do they count each United State as a separate ""land""? 

Not exactly, but you're on the right track. Notice they don't use the word ""country"". They say ""lands"" for the same reason they say Noah preserved ""kinds"" of animals in the arc: It's a vague word with no clearly-defined meaning, so they can use it to mean whatever they want.

Because being in 196 countries isn't impressive enough.

ETA: Oh and because they can use that to hide the fact that there are a number of countries where they are not allowed *at all*, so they never could claim to be in 196 countries. By using vague language, they can hide the gaping holes in their coverage.

Because remember, the good news is supposed to be preached in the entire inhabited world before the end comes. What do you say to the laity who thinks the end might come this year, and yet there are gigantic countries in which the JW's aren't allowed? Holes like that would pretty much blow a hole into the end coming any time soon theory. So they hide those holes with the word ""lands""."

lascalaveras,NoStupidQuestions,1390882002.0,"From http://blog.dictionary.com/last-name-ends-in-ez/   :

But as for the common suffix –ez,  patronymic considerations are at play. These family names are formed by adding a suffix to the end of a father’s name. The suffix –ez means “descendant of.”

(The name with the most requests actually was quite presidential — Barack Obama. Learn what “Barack” and “Obama” literally mean, here.)

Here are the definitions and contexts of some of the most frequent –ez names:

• Hernandez means “son of Hernando” or “son of Fernando,” which derives from the German name Ferdinand, or “bold voyager.” 

• Gonzalez means “son of Gonzalo.” The name Gonzalo originates with the medieval name Gundisalvus. The word part gund means “war.” 

• Perez means “son of Pero” and other versions of the name, such as Pedro and Petros. Pedro means “rock” in Spanish. It’s believed that the name comes from the apostle Simon, who Jesus called a rock, or foundation, of the church. The name may have also derived from “peral,” the name of a pear tree, or as a variation of the Sephardic Jewish surname Peretz. 

• Gomez means son of Gome or Gomo. Gomme is the similar English surname. The Middle English word “gome” means “man.”

• Gutierrez means “son of Gutierre,” which means “he who rules.” 

• Lopez means “son of Lope.” Lope is a name that comes from Lupus, a Latin name meaning “wolf.”

EDIT: I posted the above with no comment, but what I wanted to say is that your perception of the frequency of last names might be because of the above naming convention which makes different last names sound similar?

It's also worth noting, if you are talking about an immigrant community (are you in the US?  especially somewhere with few hispanics or hispanics of only a few national origins?), when people immigrate, they tend to move as a family or move somewhere where they have family - so... it's a bit of a selection bias.  You might see a lot of related hispanics, but it's not because hispanics generally are interrelated, but more that you see them together because they are related.

Aaron565,getdisciplined,1390882543.0,"I changed schools, cut contact with all my friends, and essentially dedicated a year of my life to self development. 

I went from a private school to public and spent every waking moment outside school reading articles, assembling notes, making plans, etc. It came to the point where I learned many different skills and became a genius compared to anyone in my age group.

I came home and read books, exercised. I would learn and practice areas such as public speaking and essentially master them in a month. This was due to a different ""speed"" learning process that I employed (similar to Tim Ferris's except I had been using mine long before him and mine is still more efficient). 

All of this was thanks to information provided to me by both the internet and a special group of self development/entrepreneurs that I joined. I can't say who they are for legal reasons. However ill tell you that their tuition was in the tens of thousands annually. I defiantly wasn't paying that, but that is a different story. 

However in June of last year the self development group I was in dropped me. My grandfather way dying and I got lazy for about two weeks before they cut me off. After that I completely dropped everything. They were my lifeline.

I entered a state of stagnation which has lasted until today. I am sick and tired of having all of these plans and information but no motivation nor hurt to do it. See this September I came back to my private school, and both the amount of work I get from there and the emotional drain has kept me from making progress. I have a better opportunity now than anyone I know meanwhile I find myself not doing anything in terms of just doing the work.

I already passed the hard part and I am not sure if my problem is because I cant see myself as a success internally or if I just am not motivated anymore. But regardless I need to create a problem which will bite at my ass so hard that I am forced to work. I am not sure how to do it, and day after day I loose my confidence in myself. Even reminding myself of all the work ive been through doesn't help. 

I deserve much better than this. Guys like you and me OP need to reach the bottom of the pit before making a permanent change.

Tashre,wow,1390883237.0,"To put it simply, and in a rather meta manner: **The game wasn't harder, playing the game was.**

Content was made ""difficult"" through forced means: primarily through gear levels/gear checks, requiring specific raid comps or classes present, requiring 40 different people to all schedule their lives around engaging in specific activities for several hours numerous times a week, even things like attunements and resistance gear. The actual content wasn't terribly difficult for the most part, the hard part was simply getting to those fights or getting the gear for them. Also, there's nothing challenging about a boss being completely immune to your primary school of damage.

Now, there were some exceptions to all this and some encounters that were actually extremely difficult themselves that no amount of gear could carry you through (Lich King hardmode.... the nightmares... dear god the nightmares....), but, on the whole, content was a lot simpler than the kinds of encounters you'll find in today's game. The game wasn't harder, it was just less accessible, which is why so few people/guilds were running top end content back in the day and also why Blizzard has striven to increase the accessibility of content to more players through various means, so more people can enjoy most of the game. They've still managed, quite expertly, to keep hardmodes hard, but many people point to the fact that just because some filthy casual can kill Garrosh in LFR then H-Garrosh 25 is meaningless. This is, of course, ridiculous, but most people complaining about how easy the game is becoming has never actually tried the hard content."

westyfield,gainit,1390883463.0,"*Long post, TL;DR at bottom.*

*First up:* Ignore all the people here and probably elsewhere telling you things like ""man up"", ""think what people will say about you"", ""just do it"" etc.

*Second:* Please consider going to a counsellor/therapist and see your GP. Counselling and medication are your best bets for beating this. Talk to your friends and/or family as well, I know it's hard to open up about this sort of thing but it can really help to have a few people with whom you can just chat and who can give you constant reminders that it'll all be ok. It will be ok, but while you don't feel like that, it's good to have shoulders to lean (and when necessary cry) on.

*Third:* Routine is your friend. Set an alarm, force yourself to get up at the same time every day (including weekends - disrupted sleeping patterns almost always come with depression and even one or two lies-in can throw your hard-won routine out of sync). If you can, ask a friend who gets up at a similar time to phone you five minutes after your alarm goes off to check you're up and talk you into climbing out of bed. Know what you'll eat, when you'll eat it, and when you'll be out of the house en-route to the gym. No excuses - rain or shine, whether you slept well that night or not. Make sure you have that food in the house at all times so you don't have to miss a meal. The goal is to keep the routine as consistent as possible; you'll feel better when you're sticking to it and it'll provide motivation to continue.  
Side-note: Even if you don't go to the gym every day, get up at the time you would if you were going and just do something else - read a book, do some house chores - stuff that you won't want or have time to do later in the day.

*Fourth:* If you have a bad day, don't dwell on it. Move on. There will be bad days - days you spend in bed; days you get up, get ready, and break down just before you leave the house; days you drag yourself up from a sleepless night and can barely lift anything when you reach the gym. Those days suck, because they break your routine and make you feel like a failure. You're not a failure, you just had an off day, and the best thing you can do is move on and try to make sure that day doesn't come again.

*Fifth:* Give yourself time to think. If you're anything like me you often feel overwhelmed by all the thoughts that are flying around your head, and when that happens it's easy to drop everything and just feel terrible, or you might stay up half the night worrying. Set aside some time during the daylight hours to be alone (if you have a busy schedule, fit it around travelling - perhaps to or from the gym) and just think logically about your situation.

*Sixth:* If you want to, PM me. I'm not a therapist or a doctor, I'm just a guy who knows a bit of what you're going through and is willing to listen, and talk if you wish. I'm not cured - that takes time - but all of the above has helped me in one way or another. I hope it helps you too.  
You can beat this. Most likely not alone, but with support, help, possibly medication, and definitely time, you will. :)

**TL;DR:  
1. Ignore the haters, they don't understand.  
2. Get help - therapy and/or medication. Talk to friends and/or family.  
3. Get into a routine and try to stay in it.  
4. Don't hate yourself if you fall out of your routine, just try to get back in ASAP.  
5. Allocate thinking time during the day so you don't eat up productive time.  
6. PM me if you like. I'll listen.**"

fiveifrenzy6,IWantToLearn,1390884244.0,"There are a few things that will make a huge difference. First are the quality of ingredients you are using. Second is how you are cooking them. Meats, depending on the kind/cut, require much different cooking. Some need a lot less cooking on high heats, some a lot lower heat for much longer. Third, how you are seasoning them.  If you have good quality ingredients, can cook things to perfection, and use the right herbs, salt, and spices to the right amount, then you will have an amazing dish. 

So I suggest learning a few things about how to properly execute different cooking techniques (ie. sauteing, searing, pan frying). Also explore foods you wouldn't normally get. A good cook knows a wide range of flavors and textures. Knowing how foods taste and react when cooked helps you know how to combine them. Definitely expand the spices and herbs you use. these will greatly add to your dishes and the range of flavors you will know how to use. 

My best advice to learn is watch the cooking channel. watch the iron chef and chopped. watch how they prepare things and what they combine. I greatly suggest Alton Brown's videos. he explains the science behind cooking and it makes things much clearer. "

K2TheM,motorcycles,1390884630.0,"Ex 6'2""-KLR650 (and 84 Interceptor) owner here. I'll try and answer all your other posts too. 


The KLR650 is the best bike for all around riding there ever was. It's big, soft and will go just about anywhere. Takes on single tracks like it shouldn't, will drag pegs with the right tires on it, does wheelies with ease in stock gearing (will also do stopies, but you have to ask nicely) and will do a ""ton"" if you've got a good run/tailwind. At your height you shouldn't need to do anything to it for ergonomics. Just adjust the bar angle and go. 

If you are doing a lot of highway riding (like I was) it's a good idea to change the gearing down a bit. While not bad at freeway speeds, the drone can become defining. Dropping a couple teeth in the rear and *maybe* one in the front will do the trick. It will feel painfully slow and low on power compared to your Interceptor, but the nimbleness at slower speeds will more than make up for that.

Rule of thumb with KLR's is to get the newest one you can afford, because they are all the same. Two mods that might be worth doing if you can is the dohicky mod and a front fork brace. The dohicky is a flimsy part in the engine that doesn't always go bad, but commonly does; and the fork brace is to help with the front end slop when riding hard. "

Mostly because I don't like receiving oral, and he was all about that. I had a friend who banged him too though and she thought he was great in bed, so it's all down to personal preference. 

If my current boyfriend was cursed by a witch and suddenly had a micropenis I'd stay with him, because I love him. But if before we were so emotionally close I'd found out? I would have had some serious second thoughts. "

Sure, ideally that would be the best thing to have been done.

I think what has to be taken into account are things like the violent takfiris in Sinai, which the then-president Morsi was seen to not be taking sufficient action on as president, he and other members of the MB seen to associate with openly violent, openly sectarian sorts of people in general and specifically some people who were members of (formerly) or otherwise associated with militant groups that were infamous for specific attacks in Egypt directed at various targets.

I'm rehashing what I said up there, basically, but I think it's worth stating in perpetuity that there was a very strong sense that things had come to a head by the June 30th protests and that some sort of decisive action had to be taken.

&gt; At least with the MB they could be removed democratically.

Hypothetically. But what's to say that the worst of the MB supporters would allow that to happen?

The people who aligned themselves with the MB by default wouldn't want to have Morsi out of office unless some Salafi Jihadi type was somehow, ludicrously, in position to take his place. Not something that would happen, and the people who're all violent and angry and sectarian now certainly wouldn't accept a non-Islamist taking Morsi's place as president."

eighthgear,polandball,1390885272.0,"&gt; Our armed forces, however, are not the thirtieth strongest in the world, but rather the second or third

&gt; We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under

No you don't, Dayan. Israel does possess the Jericho missile, which can reach most of Asia, Europe, Africa, and bits of the Americas. But they don't possess enough Jerichos (and the missiles can't carry large enough warheads) to ""take the world down"". Furthermore, the Jerichos are all land-based.

Those statements aren't even realistic enough to be considered a bluff. Israel can certainly rough up any Middle Eastern nation that threatens it, but if it tried going against a NATO power, or Russia, it would be in for quite a shock. Which is why they won't, even if they were somehow magically threatened with annihilation."

lascalaveras,AskMen,1390885403.0,"Yes, you are moving costs around - that's the point.

Of course companies, any company, wouldn't want to make less money.  If they could pay less per hour, they would.  That's the whole reason for minimum wage laws - to make sure they pay a minimum standard.

It's funny, everyone keeps commenting that companies will either cut their work force or increase their product's price.  I don't understand that.  Do you think companies hire more employees than they need to run their business and they can afford to cut people?  Do you think a company wouldn't charge you more for their product if they thought you would pay it?  You think they could increase their prices and don't?  

I don't find either of those scenarios to be very likely.

Also, with regard to ""moderately"" improving someone's position - when you're low income, a moderate improvement can make a huge difference in your life, so I wouldn't dismiss small gains as not being worth it. "

2) This was not a decent response. In fact neither of you have made a decent response this whole time. If you wanted a girlfriend you should have asked her to be excsulive with you. End of story.

3) No I would not GF her in your shoes. In fact, you seemed more intrigued by the sex and her money they you did about the actual girl or even the actual relationship. Seriously your line

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390885706.0,"&gt;The only horror movie I can even think that I've seen with a male protagonist is Nightmare on Elm Street 2, which is arguably one of the gayest movies ever made.

The Exorcist movies. Child's Play movies. Halloween 3 Season of the Witch. The Saw movies. Hostel. Pretty sure original Poltergeist is mostly from the point of view of the father. Wickerman. Arguably Paranormal Activity 1. Sinister. Pet Cementary. I don't think that it's that rare. Particularly the subset of ""Go somewhere weird and investigate odd shit and it all hits the fan"" movies have male leads rather frequently. (plus ""man unable to protect his family"" seems to be a bit of genre in its own) 

I think a lot of the classic 80s horror movies, particularly from the slasher genre, but not exclusively, were female starring because it was hip around that time for some reason, but probably because delivering T&amp;A was probably more important during that time (no internet yet) + maybe some gomes using some sort of female = innocence symbolism.

Now days I blame the law more than her because societies attitudes to it skewed her idea of what ethical and a moral obligations are. Tell me how it is ethical or moral for you to take away the chance of someone poor to save money and build themselves a life? Just to give that money to someone who is already plenty rich and doesn't need it?
Yes very fair.

If it was forced and my mother had no choice but to take his money I wouldn't have blamed her either, only the law. But she did have a choice. So why couldn't I have blamed her when I was young?

Like I said, I don't blame her so much for her choices now. Everyone makes mistakes, and she's my mum and I still love her. She only thought she was doing what was best, even if it wasn't."

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390886703.0,"Not sure you can really call it a 50/50 split since a lot of western RPGs just let you pick the gender of the main character.

And just because Final Fantasy has sported 2 female mains, I don't get the impression that it is that frequent even in JRPGs outside of Final Fantasy.

JAWJAWBINX,autism,1390886842.0,"You're going to want to pay more attention to what other people in the spectrum say than those outside of it, our brains work similarly to your son's and thus we have a better understanding of your son's mind. This sub is primarily parents so it'll be useful in finding things to help your son, /r/aspergers is mostly people on the spectrum so they can help you understand your son. Just read what people have said, it should be enlightening. Understanding him should be your top priority, it'll give him somebody who he can be himself with and somewhere where he's safe, more importantly you'll be able to understand how he would feel about something and keep him from people that will harm him.

Your son's brain is fundamentally different from your own (unless you're autistic as well, it is genetic and if you're old enough to be having kids you may be old enough that you wouldn't have been diagnosed as a kid) so you'll need to throw out basically everything you know about human interaction when dealing with him. He'll express his emotions differently and he'll try to read yours as if you were like him, it isn't going to work. Your emotions are going to affect him, he's going to unknowingly feel what you do to some degree (only anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise as those are the atomic emotions) so try to learn to shut off your emotions. His senses will work a bit differently. There will be some things (for example fluorescent lights) which will be disruptive to him and you'll want to avoid them, if he tries to tell you that he doesn't like something then be aware that he may not be able to properly express is, it may be torture for him. He will probably be picky about his food, it'll be due to texture and taste. Don't force foods on him or try to sneak things into other foods, it'll make him less trusting of you and his food. Try to figure out what he likes and what about it he enjoys, try to find similar things for him to try. Learn to make weighted blankets, they are expensive and he'll probably find the pressure comforting. If you can learn to make other things weighted, I instinctually make my coats and sweatshirts weighted by collecting random things in the pockets (they usually end up being at most a pound heavier than they should). Don't force eye contact on him, for most of us it's overwhelming (some are unlucky like me and feel physical pain in response to eye contact). Once he's old enough to understand that he's autistic and that it would be best for him to keep it to himself, people are exceedingly ignorant, then tell him. For reference I knew I was different when I was six, by the time I was seven I figured I was different because I was worse than everybody else, I was told when I was eight (a year or two after my diagnosis) and I was also told that I was simply different than other people and that I would be better at some things than others and need to work harder than others at times.

Don't listen to anything that Autism Speaks says, they're essentially an anti-autistic group. If you want to contribute to research then investigate heavily into not only the group but the individuals doing the research and the ideas behind the research. Don't contribute to anything involving genetics, it's progressed too fast and a lot of us are getting scared. If ASAN is affiliated with something then it should be good, think of ASAN as the NAACP of autism.

If anybody talks about ""curing"" or ""fixing"" your son then ignore them. If they're close then either cut them out of your life or reeducate them, they will be a negative influence on your son because they believe there is something inherently wrong with him. Your son is the way his genetics were supposed to make him, he was conceived autistic and there's no more wrong with that than being conceived black, ginger, or blue eyed. He is perfect, he may not be what you expected but he's perfect all the same.

I would advise strongly against ABA or any other behaviorally based therapy or any sort of medication in relation to his being autistic. Most ABA practices do things similarly to when I went through it, they try to force ""normalcy"" with no regard for the individual or the reasoning behind the behavior. They force eye contact on those who consider it torture and they take away our stims instead of teaching us self control so that we can better suppress our stress until we can properly deal with it, it's abuse. The places that don't do it that way are essentially day care, depending on how your son deals with his environment then putting him in a normal day care may be better. The problem is that you can't really tell the difference between the two, in most cases trained professionals can't. If you do put him in behavioral therapy then make sure that it is in home and that you are able to watch the entire time (and that nobody is trying to convince him that the therapist is trying to help him, he has to decide that on his own), best case scenario you can find an autistic individual (high functioning of course) who'd be willing to sit in as well to ensure that everything runs smoothly and perhaps act as a mentor of sorts to your son. The medications prescribed for ASD are either to treat comorbid conditions (anxiety disorders and the like) or to sedate your kid enough that they're manageable, in general they're a bad idea especially before he's old enough that he can both decide for himself and not have his development altered by them. If somebody suggests SSRIs in response to his being autistic then ignore them, SSRIs are the simplest way to screw up an autistic kid while making them easier to handle.

In order to really understand your son you'll need to understand what has happened to us thus far. You need to understand the history of his people so that you can understand our present and improve his future. It'll take you to some dark places, it'll make you fear for him and make him all the more precious. Understand that to us the horror stories are all the worse for us because all to often we can legitimately say that it could have been us, that much of what happened to whoever we're reading about did happen to us. I hear about yet another autistic child who was abused, who was murdered and I can't help but to remember the abuse I suffered, I can't help but to mourn, to fear, to wish that it never happened, to be jealous, to feel joy that the pain that life clearly had in store for them (because if things could be that horrific for them at such a young age then they are almost certain for things to be similarly awful in the future) never came, to hate myself for what I am, to hate myself for who I was, to hate myself for what I feel, to promise myself that I will do what I can to make sure that they're the last one that need suffer so horribly. When I hear about yet another autistic teen or adult (or even child) committing suicide I remember when I almost did the same, the weight of the blade, the feel of it against my spine, the uncaring gaze of my father, the smirk on my mother's face, the ecstasy of knowing that I could be certain that things wouldn't get any worse, the pain of realizing that it wouldn't mean a damn thing and I would be better served by letting my life serve as a fuck you to everybody who stood against me. I hear about the success of others and I think of all that I've done, everything I've accomplished in spite of what others have put in my way. When I see posts like your own I fantasize about when I'll be in the same position, hopefully, and dedicating my life to protecting a life that I helped make,a life that will be so much better than my own, a life that will be filled with so much more joy, a life that I will love unconditionally until the day I die, a life that will make me hopeful once more, a life which will speak volumes of the love that it came from.

Everybody has to go through some pain but the joy is worth it. That being said if I could take whatever pain your son may go through on myself so that he could know nothing but joy I would, I've been through enough already and knowing that I made a life that much better would me so much happier than it could bring sorrow. I think I may have a bit of a martyr complex.

? 

You say that it's not because of gender roles yet argue the reason is because in Japanese culture women are associated with the spiritual? How is that not a gender stereotype/gender role, even if it is a positive one? 

And it doesn't really explain why a similar phenomenon exists in Western horror movie culture. It's possible that Western culture and Japanese culture have different cultural reasons for arriving at the same conclusion (women ending up in horror contexts) and that in a roundabout helping games to cross over/being accepted in the west, even if the reason why we are used to women in horror heroine roles is very different.

This is of course because the NSA as part of the security reads the same reports as the rest of us, and talks to the same people who do all these things. 

Snowden's leak has provided some mostly useless details we reasonably inferred but didn't know in detail too (names of programmes, confirmation of the scope and participants and so on).

But to the specific question at hand - we now know the NSA used FISA rulings to demand access some places, and companies that tried to fight were not allowed to discuss the fight publicly. 

Then you have to realize just how big these companies are, how little loyalty any of the employees have, and how easy it is to spy on your employer for your own government.  All of the 'tricks' Snowden used to get access to all of the NSA files he did (in part by using his authority as a sys admin  to get people to give him passwords or to log in for him) work at Google and Apple and Facebook, and all of the major equipment suppliers for those companies.  

Oh and add to that the difficulty in keeping networks secure and even  if you know someone is trying to hack your network you may not know who they are, and when you report it to the FBI, the FBI  call the NSA and the NSA say to not worry about it, what are you going to do?"

Immigrating to another developed country is stressful. There's bureaucracy, complicated tax systems, health insurance, people treating you like shit because you're an outsider, heaps of frustration as people misunderstand you or refuse to speak English. I understand that your course is crap and you feel like your life is unnecessarily stressful, but you are assuming that all you need is to get away.

I see people mentioning here how unskilled EU immigrants left their country in the 00's and now live comfy lives abroad. It's not the 00's any more though.

The Gulf of Sidra incident was about 3 months before the release of the movie, so it might have been too close to make any difference on the script but there were enough things going on that were not full blown wars, just people not liking each other that incidents happen.

LolaRuns,GirlGamers,1390888788.0,"&gt;That's a foreign dichotomy which doesn't exist in Japan. You're assuming a gender role which... It's hard to explain but that's not something that is taught in schools, culture, or anything as far as I know from my time there.

Just because it's not something that affects real life women doesn't mean that it's not a stereotype. If something disproportionately crops up in certain myths yet I would consider that a cultural gendered stereotype. =&gt; that doesn't mean that it's a negative thing. It's like how in many cultures the sun is male and the moon is female (except for example in German where it is switched around). Or how what kind of fertility gods exist in various cultures (loving mother vs. big dicked male fertility god). 

&gt;I haven't paid attention to every horror movie out there but I'm pretty sure that horror movies in Japan work in a different fashion. Movies like the Ring don't really have an equivalent here except for maybe Al Hitchcock's older works and it just seems like a people are trying to imply something on games that isn't really there.

I'm sorry, but none of that made any causal sense to me. What does the Ring maybe potentially, but not really not having a Western equivalent have to do with people ""implying"" something about video games? 

The Western horror movie culture I believe has most people explicitly thinking of the female leads of THE granddaddies of many horror movie franchises, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween and Friday the 13th (as well as maybe less huge movies from around that time period, like Hellraiser, Last House of the Left or even I Spit On Your Grave) even if various other types (from Psycho to The Shining to Rosemary's Baby to Carrie to Scream) exist. It makes sense to bring these up because some of the resourceful heroines in these movies (like the one from Nightmare for example) feel pretty similar to some of the resourceful/scrappy heroines in horror games, even in those cases where they come from a different culture backdrop. 

Cause and effect: We see an effect, aka ""females are less likely to be the star in action roles, but somehow it is less rare/more established/more accepted/more successfull comparatively in horror movies"" and we speculate on what the cause is. This doesn't mean that the cause is negative, just if there's an effect, there is a cause somewhere. Especially if it's a highly consistent trend. "

ssjAWSUM,AdviceAnimals,1390888985.0,"If I may be honest, I have a confession.  I was about to graduate college, and needed just a bullshit 4 credit class, seeing as all my other criteria were met.  I decided to take an advanced class in finite mathematics.  I took this class because (this may sound like I'm patting myself on the back, but I swear it's all truth) I actually enjoyed tutoring other students who had difficulty with the lessons.  I felt I had a real chance to make myself enjoy the work, and to actually help out people who were trying and truly struggling.  

In the class were several members from the collegiate basketball team.  I knew from day one they would be trouble since they all sat together and mocked others around them.  Paying them no mind I just sat in the back of the class in my normal fashion.  The class was held once a week for 3 hours, so basically the class session of 3 hours had on average 3 FULL lessons crammed into one sit-down class.

I MADE SURE to set up tutor sessions and moved MY schedule around to help out students who needed it.  Students who needed the class to graduate, single parents looking for a quick degree, so on and so forth.

Here's the kicker...

Every time one of the mouth-breathers who were there on a sports scholarship attempted to answer a question in class, and failed miserably, I made it a point to make a loud chuckle.  They failed every test, and consistently sought out my help seeing as I would hold before and after tutor sessions.  It was endless, at the gym they would badger me non-stop for help.  I refused them, and gave my reason as that they were condescending and rude to everybody else I saw them interact with in that class.

Long story short, they eventually failed out of the class, and I lost track of them.

I'm all for a sports scholarship, but as long as it is in conjunction with a responsible academic history as well."

kornberg,HomeImprovement,1390889815.0,"Pictures would help but unless the door is flapping wide open or there is a massive gap between the door and the frame, it's probably not leaking enough to keep the first floor cold while the second floor is hot. I don't understand what you mean when you say they put the wrong kind of framing on--a rental is going to have a pre-hung door because that is cheapest and easiest. 

Central heating/air can't really keep multiple floors even--there's always going to be a room or floor that gets more climate control than the other. If it's too hot upstairs, then turn the heat down when you go to bed. Why waste electricity heating an area that you aren't even in? As long as the bottom floor stays above 55 or so, you should be fine. You could also try closing a few vents in the rooms you don't spend a lot of time in. That will divert heat to the area that isn't getting as much. 

You can go to a home improvement store and get weather stripping and window caulk. The people there can help you find the right kind but a lot of it is self adhesive so you just stick on these foam strips so that they cover the gaps in the door. Use the caulk to seal the windows--don't seal them shut, seal the space between the glass and the metal part that holds the glass. Do not seal the windows shut. You can find about 10,000 videos on You Tube that can show you how to do each of these things. These things will help keep the warm air in and the cold out--it's not perfect but it will help. "

rohrspatz,askscience,1390889886.0,"Generally speaking (*generally*), anything that's small enough for you to swallow without discomfort is small enough to pass through the pyloric sphincter. However, if certain things keep getting ""held back"" because they're big or irregular enough to not pass *easily*, some buildup could happen, or just very delayed passage through the stomach.

Thankfully there's another mechanism to deal with that. At least a couple times a day, a ""migrating motor complex"" happens - basically, a wave of stronger-than-normal peristalsis that moves things along more quickly and helps to sweep through any left-behind stuff.

(People who lack this function do tend to develop [bezoars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezoar) fairly easily - so yes, in the absence of this ""cleanup"" mechanism, some things actually would just stay in the stomach forever.)"

Sharkictus,ABCDesis,1390890136.0,"I disagree. It seems every culture goes through an era when formal clothes go from a bright colorful visually noisy to more subtle darker with a bright highlight. Think European art of the formal wear of the aristricracy 400-500 years ago to the suits we have now. 

Of course thats the male version, the female version hasn't really created its own standard (yet) and it adapts male formal wear. And it sort of is lame as hell. 

I'd say among non western formal wear, Indian girls clothes are only a little visually loud as the European aristocracy of old, and I'm unsurprised the lack of support for it by others. 

It'll take a few centuries for the the fashion to adopt, and for a subtle professional formal woman's clothing to appear. Key part of this developing is more women working, and more being entrpeneaur bosses."

But you can be damned sure that if he came to me when he was a teenager and told me he wanted to see a counselor about something that he didn't feel comfortable telling me about, I would be on the phone making him an appointment before the words were done coming out of his mouth. 
Barring that, I would go talk to your school counselor and ask for a referral. Most towns and cities have resources for greatly reduced or even free counseling. 

But bottom line is this: Counseling. Now. Like, call tomorrow. And cheers to you for recognizing your issue and seeking treatment. I am studying to be a counselor, and I can tell you that situations like this can be a slippery slope. It is easy to justify pushing things like this just a teeeensy tiny bit at a time, eventually finding yourself in a situation that will ruin both your life and the lives of your victims. I'm really proud of you for putting a stop to this now. Let me know if there is any way I can help. If you don't have resources where you live, I will help you find a way to get some help somehow.

LolaRuns,Games,1390890603.0,"I can't help it, but to me an RPG where you have a fixed main character/no choice at all in the main character very rarely feel truly (western) RPG to me. Yes there are exceptions, like The Witcher and Deus Ex, but to me that usually really kills the RPG mood and moves the game closer to ""action game with some RPG elements"" territory (like Risen 2) for example. 

IMO when it works it usually works only when the character in question is really memorable. As soon as the character is only close to some generic normal person boredom sinks in quickly. Not having a gender option makes some sense since the game is supposed to be more realistic to the time period, but not even cosmetic  customization is pretty disappointing imo.

tdvx,airsoft,1390891283.0,"I've been to a couple Lion Claws events, Lightning Strike 3 and Red Storm East 2. Lightning Strike was 300-350 players, RSE was 450 i think.

Both were the best airsoft experiences ever. 

LS3 was in Buffalo, NY and there were 5 or so factories/plants. Mostly indoor action, but the building to building combat was the best. All of the offices had papers and shit from the 80's still on their desks. Great /r/abandonedporn material. kinda funny watching a father and son that were kayaking buy drop their jaws looking at as while they kayaked by on the river lol. 

 RSE2 was at the Scranton Lace factory, pretty much all indoor, 1 million square feet. amazing cqb action. tons of cool shit to look at, lots of above ground tunnels from building to buildings.

All LC events have varying objectives (detonate bombs, collect weapon caches, collect intel from computers, protect VIPs/rescue hostages). It's really hard to ref games with hundreds of people in a 1 million square foot warehouse, but they do a damn good job anyway, they tend to keep refs with the larger groups of people. All the palces are abandoned, so there's lots of pure dark areas.

Bring everything! I go through about 3000 BBs in the weekend. Bring extra batteries, extra parts, and speedloaders. You'll need a backpack with BBs and batteries so you don't have to leave the AO to go to your car and get those, same with green gas/propane. Mags are up to you, it depends on how you play. If you're set up to shoot 50bb/s you will probably want as many mags as you can fit. I run GBB only now, and run 6 LM4 mags and 5 M93r mags. that works for me, i'm a lot more conservative when it comes to shooting, i prefer flanking rather than supressing and getting lucky. i might pick up an extra LM4 mag though, past ops have been almost pure cqb, my pistol might not be as effective outdoor. You absolutely need a hydro carrier, can't emphasize that enough. you'll for sure want a flashlight. 5 min chemlights are good to have too.full seal eyepro is required at LC events. Helmet, when you're walking around in catacombs and shit in patch dark, and walking down tiny rusty staircases, and you're 6'6 like me, you want a fucking helmet lol. Car chargers, batteries will die and you'll need to charge them in your car morethan likely. i'll make my whole kit list in another post.

make sure your gun is 100% before you go, and bring a backup gun(s). my scar broke down completely at LS3. my friends' G&amp;G combat machine lasted through RSE2, but RSE2 claimed 3 of my friend's guns.

I'm really looking forward to RSE3 this year, it's at an abandoned resort in Pennsylvania. the AO looks unreal, and it looks like it'll have a lot more outdoor action than the past events i've gone to."

bigtcm,AskReddit,1390891512.0,"Former teacher here.

I taught at an inner city high school (read: ghetto as fuck). In reality, all of us teachers knew that most of the students would not be attending college. However, the entire staff still tried to instill the ""you should go to college"" ideology on the student body. Reasons explaining why are listed below.

* Graduation rates affect the school's rating. Students that qualify for college are definitely on track toward graduation.

* It attempts to hold every student to the same ""high"" standard. I'd want everyone in our society to have a basic understanding of how the world works, and at least basic reading and writing skills, regardless of their profession.

* You hope that at least one of your students makes it to college. One of my students was accepted into Berkeley. Several of my students were accepted into other four year universities and from what I hear, they're all still totally kicking ass there. It's been nearly 4 years now since I've taught and I still get a little lump in the back of my throat thinking about how proud I am of those students.

&gt;  My problem with this is, colleges assume that you've ""learned to college"" in high school. What do you think? ... Does this change how you teach?

Geez. What a series of tough questions. Honestly, I don't think I prepared my students well enough to know how to ""college"". It's just really sad to think that our best and brightest are at the bottom of the totem pole once they go to college. I think back to when I was an incoming undergrad...I had already taken AP Calc BC, as well as a multitude of other AP classes and a few community college classes too. Our school has two AP classes total, and didn't even offer calculus. The few students who had enough math skills to take calculus had to either go to a community college or take a calc class at another high school. Sad. 

If I were to return to the classroom, I think I'd increase the critical thinking required for my classes. To those students who made it to a four year university, I truly felt I did them a disservice.

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1390891683.0,"Factor in fees and inflation adjusted value to get a more accurate lower number. Also factor in the opportunity cost of those investments centralizing capital rather than circulating. I tend to think the decades of chasing wealth in the stock market is a big reason local economies have collapsed in many places. It's a form of capital flight largely for no productive end since things like index fund investment are simply investing in established large corporations. Mainly what we've done is enable vast inequality by centralizing capital in financial markets often hundreds or thousands of miles away.

Compounding interest certainly is a great thing to have for savers. There was a time keeping money in local credit unions and banks saw good return rates. Around 1990 you could get high single digit interest rates on savings and CD accounts. Of course the cost to borrow was also relatively high, but at least that capital circulated largely locally. With the Federal reserve policies that have taken place since then we've seen those interest rates barely surpass 1% on medium term CDs and fairly low costs to borrow for things like mortgages. Unfortunately, that's where a lot of peoples wealth ends up in housing and well that's what this whole post 2008 world is from.

tl;dr; Compounding interest is great. It would be even better if we had good return opportunities near home instead of in financial markets many miles away concentrating capital expanding inequality. "

Sherm,AskHistorians,1390891743.0,"For literary works, not exceptionally. The work of mystery and horror writers were fairly popular in Japan, especially in serials which were in some ways the Japanese equivalent of pulp novels. Detective stories experienced a vogue during the 20s, and efforts were made to translate large portions of western works. For example, Taro Hirai (better known as Edogawa Rampo) was a particular fan of western mystery and horror (his pen name is taken from the name one of his favorite authors, sort of; Edoga waRam po, which, spoken quickly, sounds like Edgar Allan Poe) and he attempted to translate the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle into Japanese. It's actually part of a fascinating process by which outside forms and tropes were first incorporated into Japanese culture before being integrated and made fully ""Japanese."" It's a situation that was far from unusual, especially in the Taisho era, when there was still a fair amount of experimentation with outside cultural ideas and tropes. Not nearly so much as the postwar era, certainly, but more than characterized the prewar Showa era, when government censorship expanded from overtly political and economic works to more apolitical materials. A good book about the subject is *Purloined Letters: Cultural Borrowing and Japanese Crime Literature, 1868-1937*, by Mark Silver. Really goes into the process by which the works were adopted and adapted."

Simple plain example that is grossly undermining the grand scheme of this point is as follows:  Take the passion in the guy that paints his face, buys season tickets and names his daughter ""Peyton"", and direct that passion towards social reform, and congressional change, even a fraction of that energy could do wonders for the world.  I wouldn't ever take away a hobby or a love-for-something away from a person, it is in no way my right to deprive an individual of something they love.  I just want to see some of that time and energy diverted to making a better future for ourselves.  Lame and trite as it may sound, it really is what I believe.  

Before I forget, I wanted to mention this to you as well.  Many people defending their side on this issue against me (many have been respectful), have brought up that those ""football fans"" should not be diverting their passion because ""You wouldn't want that ignorance dedicated to political issues (or similar arguments)"".  I also feel this is a sad statement.

Ross also guarded Joe Johnson on a couple of plays and although Terrence is long he isn't anywhere near strong enough to guard someone who has around 40 lbs on him (JJ).

You are not prepared emotionally or financially for this. Your best bet (if it's either too late or not morally consistent with your values to consider an abortion) is to pursue as open an adoption as possible if you have any interest in being in the kid's life.

If he had said no and passed out and then she had continued to have sex with him it would be rape, but that is not what happened and as far as he remembers she stopped while he was conscious. God the word rape gets thrown around so liberally.    

OP, I'm sorry that you're in this situation. Honestly try not to beat yourself up about it anymore. Sex is as much of a mental thing as it is a physical thing. Do you feel like you're still a virgin? If so then you can say you're a virgin. Virginity is what you describe it as, it's not a static term. You can say you're a virgin until you have consensual sober sex if you want, because that's what you consider losing your virginity to be."

Better yet, leave names out altogether.  I like doing this for two reasons:

1. Not giving *my* name sends her a message of mystery about me, while piquing her curiosity.  I want her to be interested enough in me to ask what my name is, i'm not going to just give it to her as a freebee.

2. Not asking *her* name sends her a message of ""do I really care enough to ask you? not yet.""  It makes her feel like she has to prove something to me to pique *my* interest.  This gets her talking about herself.

xAFBx,AskMen,1390893506.0,"I'm half with you on this one. I love hockey and grew up playing it. However, I made the decision when I was twelve not to drink. It's getting better now that my friends have moved on past partying every weekend to social drinking or trying new beers when we go out to find one they like the for the taste. My brain actually shuts off when anyone over the age of 19 starts a sentence with, ""I was so drunk...""

The easiest thing to do to make friends is to find common ground. In my experience the easiest thing to use as common ground is music. Almost everyone likes music and a lot of people have a broad range of tastes so its somewhat likely that you and whomever you are talking to will have an artist or band that you both like and can carry on conversation from there.

If all else fails, ask the about themselves. 

&gt;What kinds of men are you friends with or would you like to be friends with? What kinds of things do you like to talk about with your male friends? How important are the traditional ""manly"" pastimes to you? Would you ever consider being friends with someone who doesn't share your interests?

I feel like I'm a special case in this area because I went to a very small high school in a small town in rural Northern Ontario, Canada; you don't really have a choice in who you're friends are, or at least I didn't at my school (my grade 12 graduating class had ~88 students). My friends and I are somewhat different people, but we have where we grew up and different hobbies in common. Of the four of us, we all have different things that connect us to one another - for example, with my buddy Dave we both love music (namely metal), Henry Rollins and hockey and bond over those things. With one of my other buddies we bond over our hate for Apple (and love of Android/Google) as well as computers/tech and gaming (he keeps trying to get me to play LoL and I'm trying to convince him to play some MtG with me). 

The traditional ""manly"" past times are only as important as you make them. For me, I can take them or leave them depending on how I'm feeling that day. 

I'm open to being friends with someone with whom I don't share any interests, but I'm sure that I can find something we have in common - my list of hobbies that I'm interested in, not to mention taste in music, is pretty varied."

I also normally put concealer over my foundation, but for color-correcting concealer I find it's best to go under foundation for a more seamless look instead of splotches of salmon around my face :P 

I can definitely feel you on that, I have to hide my tweezers from myself so I don't automatically reach for them. It's like brushing my teeth, every night I need to do it!

redsekar,badhistory,1390895820.0,"&gt;In Hinduism and Buddhism, (someone please step in if I misspeak) the material world is considered to be an illusion, and is even believed to be evil in some cases. In Christianity, the material world, while inferior to the eternal, spiritual world, is God's good creation: ""God looked at everything he had made, and found it very good"" (Genesis 1:31). This is a fundamental difference in worldviews.

Note that Gnostics would be much closer to the buddhist viewpoint than the mainstream christian viewpoint in this respect.  Of course, gnostics aren't exactly thick on the ground these days...

So I guess my second favorite is Avatar: The Last Airbender. Yeah, yeah, it's a cartoon that aired on Nickelodeon, aimed at kids and young teens, but don't dismiss it just because of that. It's like a Pixar or Dreamworks movie; Kids can watch, but teens and adults get the most enjoyment out of it.

It takes place in a world inhabited by bizarre hybrid animals, otherwordly spirits, and humans. Among humans are a very large amount of people known as ""Benders"" who can manipulate and control the various Elements using the physical motions of martial arts. I don't want to spoil too much, because the show is best watched blind, but the show follows a being known as ""The Avatar"". A spiritual force of nature incarnated into human form, and the only being that can bend all four elements instead of just one.

Give the first four episodes (the first disk of season one) a watch before passing any judgement. Afterwards, choose. If you liked anything you saw, I guarantee you it's going to be your new favorite by the end of the second of three seasons. If you didn't like it, well hey...

With the behaviour of Royce and Hadrian, these are not evil men. They are basically good people forced into a situation that neither of them really enjoy. It's the reason for their constant discussions of what to do when they retire. They happen to be stuck because stealing things is what the two of them are best suited for.

And lastly, the use of very standard fantasy tropes. I found this to be one of the best parts of the stories, because even though they were tropes, Sullivan did not just put them in and then think that everybody would know what he was talking about. He puts the relationships between the races into his worldbuilding. He ties that back to the behaviour of the races, cultures and organisations in the current world. For example [Massive Worldbuilding Spoilers.](#s There's a big monolithic church. Why does it exist? Because it's descended from the saviour of humanity. Why does it hate half elves? Why does the leader never show his face? Because it's been taken over by the big bad of the series.)

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1390897204.0,"&gt; If the price of an hour of labour has gone up, the natural and predictable response is to hire fewer hours of labour, at the margin: either take on fewer workers, or give them fewer hours.

There are limits to how far hours may be cut while still servicing customer needs. A larger distortion is present when a status threshold typically on the number of hours worked causes a significant cost of labor add on. Such as overtime pay requirements or the ACA full time status costs of insurance rather than a flat percentage cost of employment made available for coverage which would make an hour and hour. Just because it's obvious doesn't mean it's fundamentally what is occurring or can occur for a given business. Even if the effect is a 10% reduction in hours worked, but a rate increase of 20%/hr you're still ahead.

&gt; This is the consequence of trying to do social justice on the cheap. 

Raising a minimum wage isn't cheap. There's a limit to how much can be absorbed and at what pace before it starts to put people out of business.

&gt;Only a small proportion of those at work earn the minimum wage, and only a small proportion of those on minimum wage work full time. Most are part-timers, second earners, students. So even if there were no adverse employment effects, it wouldn’t make more than a small dent in the poverty rolls.

A rising minimum wage can be a useful tool in concert with UBI and automation to reduce the number of hours an individual must work to achieve a comfortable life. Personally I'd like to see us move towards 30hr/week normalized as full time with wages and benefits that encourage that. A low wage floor seems to me a great way to encourage the opposite, namely people working multiple jobs near the minimum in dual income households. UBI certainly halps that requirement some, but in the long run I think we should be shooting for UBI + 20hr/week minimum wage being a pretty comfortable life. Ignoring the wage floor I think fails to get us where we need to go.

&gt; If we really want to help the poor, here’s a radical idea: give them more money. Only do so directly, using the tax and transfer system, rather than fixing wages and hoping some of it reaches them. 

I want to do both and more. Higher wages, more basic benefits, fewer hours per individual, high rates of employment at those lower hours. "

Aside from that: project managers are much easier to find for companies than people with strong technical skills. So most companies would like you to go the developer route. They will probably have many (more experienced) project managers available.

Not to say that you can't become a project manager after starting out as a developer; I started out as a developer and it's one of my roles. But the most important aspect of being a project manager is experience; I don't know a single company that would let you manage a project by yourself with your 2 years of experience."

BlueCarrotAntenna,czech,1390901216.0,"I feel like I should elaborate since you sound so surprised. :)

Russian and Czech are both Slavic languages, but they're not intelligible. They're as close as for example English in German, see [this interesting graphic](http://elms.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/lexicaldistanceielangs.jpg). This means that while some words are sort of familiar and very simple sentences might be recognizable, you won't understand the other language. The two languages also use some completely different sounds, use different word order and are different grammatically, even though they might seem very similar at first. 

For example, while Czech has 7 cases, Russian has 6. Russian cases also use different model words and there are fewer of them (I believe there is only 1 masculine, 1 neuter and 2 feminine ones; on the other hand Czech has 6 masculine, 4 neuter and 4 feminine). This means that a Russian speaker will be used to applying a single set of cases to all masculine words, while in Czech they'll have to apply 6 sets of cases and learn which word belongs to what model group, which is not quite intuitive to them. Also some Russian masculine words are feminine in Czech (i.e. tramvaj).

Now I do think that a Russian speaker does have an advantage over an English speaker when learning Czech, mostly because they're used to the concept of cases, even if they are different in Czech, but also because conjugation is actually very similar, so it's one less thing to learn. But it still remains hard and my mum will still on occasion say something like ""Talíře jsou ve skříňke"" (I'd guess partially because that's her native Russian case applied to a Czech word and partly because she forgets the k -&gt; c shift). Having another Slavic language as your mother tongue can introduce a whole different set of challenges."

The only tweek I would add is that I do actually have a distaste for the NFL fan community.  It seems to be overbearing and too in your face for my taste.

My desire is to share the passion of football with that of bettering the political state of America, not to abolish the love and fandom around the sport.  Personally, I can't stand the brute like behavior I see over take many grown men when it comes to football, but as I have stated many times before, I would never take that right away from anyone.

EvanYork,TrueChristian,1390901980.0,"&gt; This is incredibly confusing to me. How can you not expect a Jew to base his teachings on his own interpretations of Jewish law when speaking to other jews?

I believe that emphasizing the Jewish identity of Jesus is a poor way to read the gospels.  He clearly had his own interpretation of the Jewish laws.  The problem: these aren't based on the text.  They're based on the revelation of Jesus.  No Jew would read the Old Testament and come to the same theological conclusions as Jesus, because it's simply not in there.

But, to put it in more concrete terms, people simply don't always end up believing something in the framework of the religion they had their roots in.  A Jew talking to other Jews will only base his teachings on the Jewish law if he actually believes in the Jewish law.  And no, I'm not saying Jesus didn't believe in them, it's just not a good assumption to make.

&gt;but you should at least take scripture as seriously as he did

I'm not taking it any less seriously.  I'm just prioritizing it in a different way then you.

&gt;Jesus is present throughout the OT as the Word that came to the prophets, so that means the OT must be able to stand on its own because it is Jesus.

I don't think that follows at all.  If the old testament stands on it's own, we are still under the law and our faith is in vain (and that's ignoring that you haven't proven the idea that Jesus is the ""word that came to the prophets"").

&gt;Early christian writings that were written by non-Jews disagreed with Jews because they did not have a Jewish foundation and instead used pagan understandings of the world.

That simply isn't correct.  For one, there is literally no evidence that there was ever a substantial Jewish-Christian community.  Secondly, it was always separate from Judaism.  The Didache, which is older then the gospels, explicitly tells Christians not to associate with Jews.  **Early Christians disagreed with Jews because Christianity disagrees with Jews.**

&gt;Judaism has its own idea of the ""son of god"" as a title for the king of Israel. 

Nothing in Judaism makes that claim.  1 Chronicles 17:13 doesn't seem to either: the passage is referring to the messiah.  Jesus isn't God's Son because he's the king, he's God's Son because he's the Son of David and the Son of God.  The best you can get out of this verse is, ""Judaism already had it's own idea of the Son of God as the messiah,"" which seems to better fit the orthodox notion of a divine messiah instead of the notion that ""son of god"" is just some title for a king.

&gt;Since Jesus is a combination of prophet, priest, and king, he is the perfect earthly representation of god. Applying Greek ideas of divinity to a Jewish man is the problem. 

There aren't any Greek ideas of divinity here.  The notion of a God who is both incarnated on earth and present in heaven is not found in any Greek ideas.  It has rough parallels to the Hindu notion of avatars, but that's clearly not related.

Now, are their non-Jewish ideas here?  Certainly, but Jesus and the early church were brimming with non-Jewish ideas.  Even you have given only an extremely non-Jewish conception of divinity.

*AFTERTHOUGHT:*

&gt;""But to us there is but **one God**, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and **one Lord** Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.

See how the choices of what you bold makes all the difference?

How can we have one God who is not our one Lord?  If our one God is also our Lord, we cease to have one Lord.  If our one Lord and our one God are in fact One God, then we continue to have one God and one Lord."

two guineas minted in the 1770s is about 17g of gold with a current market value of £379.63 or $628.42

The equivalent buying power can be calculated here: http://futureboy.us/fsp/dollar.fsp?quantity=2&amp;currency=guineas&amp;fromYear=1770

phaqueue,wow,1390911900.0,"Having raided in Vanilla, all the way through ICC nearly non-stop (short breaks here and there) then coming back a couple months ago. (Haven't done any heroic content in MoP and skipped all of cata)

I can give you some of my experiences:

Gearing:

In Vanilla especially, gearing was a HUGE hurdle. I've heard people loudly complain because they didn't get their tier 4 piece in the ENTIRE 3 weeks they've been 90 and running LFR. To put that into perspective, I raided BWL for multiple years on my priest and never got my Transcendence bracers. Oh and the whole set was needed for the top bonus, they were at 3, 5 and 8 pieces of an 8 piece set. We were a Naxx guild and would still have people running weekly MC pugs trying to get gear they wanted/needed from there to fill out sets/etc (think of someone who is on Garrosh heroic having to still run LFR Mogushan Vaults for 1 piece.

 On top of this, the classes themselves were very different. This was before +heal was merged into +spellpower. So there were separate pieces for healers. This also meant that if you were a healer, you couldn't use that gear to go out and farm things (you could auto-attack and heal yourself, which took FOREVER to kill anything - as a pally or a priest). This wasn't as big of a deal though because - there was no dual-spec. You had one spec. If you wanted to change, you were paying 50g each time you wanted to swap specs. (Dual specs didn't hit until Wrath I believe - someone correct me if I'm wrong). That 50g added up, especially in a time where the 1000g to get your epic riding was considered a TON of gold. 

There was no group or raid finder. You used trade chat/guild chat. This meant that before you could even get into raids, you needed to get gear from 5 and 10 mans (UBRS and LBRS were both 10 man dungeons). You would sit in trade chat and spam. Once you finally formed the group, either you were lucky and people (including a warlock) would be at the instance and could summon (no summoning stones) or you would all run there. Sometimes you would get there and someone would drop, then you would return to town and spam again for more people, hoping that more don't drop.

If you do finally get a group, you need to complete the instance. Some of them were long (BRD was a nightmare) or odd (Tribute runs were harder than they are now - you needed to bring stuff with you) or difficult (I remember MANY a group wiping in UBRS and breaking up without finishing (espeically after arguments over the Pristine Hide of the Beast)

Once you get your gear, you're ready for Molten Core right? Nope, you need fire resist gear. Hopefully you picked up a bit from what you ran to get geared, but likely you still need more. Head to the AH and buy yourself some Green fire resist pieces. Yes, they're expensive because everyone needs/wants them. OK now you got your FR you're ready for MC right? Good - find a guild to run it with. (or later on PUGs - another FUN story - trying to get 40 PUG people to do anything together was like herding cats, usually it was 20ish people from a good well-progressed guild that vastly outgeared the content carrying the rest of the raid)

Ever seen Garr? If not... look at this [Garr](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqso6o92pmU) See how all those little adds around him are constantly shifting around? They all needed to be assigned to either a tank or warlock (for banish). The fun part here? There were no raid markers. The setup for this fight took longer than the fight itself. It consisted of the raid leader having to keep track of which is which and go ""ok tank 1 assist me, that's your target"", ""ok warlock 1 assist me, that's your target"". There was no focus either (I don't believe) so you couldn't just focus it and move on. Then, usually about halfway through this process, one of the tanks or warlocks would go ""I lost my target"" and the whole process would start over. There was also no way to see who was targeting something to do it that way. 

After every boss is a rune. These days, these runes just turn off when the boss dies. Back when MC was current, they didn't, you had to run to a small island to get water to douse them. The water was 1-use only. If you didn't  have 8, someone was running halfway through the instance. Once you got exalted you at least got an unlimited use version...

How about AQ? Remember all that fire resist gear you got? It's worthless. You now need nature resist, well some people do at least. The tanks and ""sponges"" namely rogues who were going to soak up poison damage. Everyone needed at least a little, but sponges/tanks needed a ton... Want to raid AQ40 as a rogue? You better have a NR set. Where does the best NR gear come from? It's crafted from materials that drop in raid. So most guilds were not posting this stuff, they were crafting it for their raiders.

Finally, Naxx:

Patchwerk was the fight that blocked SO many guilds. We spent a long time on him (weeks? months? felt like forever).

Let me break down this fight. You need 4 tanks. 1 main tank and 3 ""hateful strike"" tanks. They all had to run in together, the hateful tanks had to get ""keyed"" meaning they needed to get hit with hateful strikes, before the DPS could move in. Pulled from WoWWiki about the original fight:

&gt;**Hateful Strike**
Base damage is 22100-29900 physical damage, thankfully this is mitigated through a high ac. The average hit is ~8000 on a BWL/AQ40 geared Warrior in defensive stance (there were no non-warrior tanks back then). This ability will hit the main tank if the HS tanks are not properly healed. The ability will hit the character with the highest health in melee range. Highest HP and threat factors into this, but the pattern is typically A B A B C A B A B C in a typical fight.

Most DPS actually stepped into the slime which lowers your health a ton just to make sure this didn't hit them at all. 

For the healers, you were assigned to either the main tank or a hateful tank. If you were on a hateful tank - you needed to cast a heal that hit for a specific amount (I want to say 800ish) on that tank (buffs could alter how much your heals hit for). You would downrank to that heal. You needed to be able to cast this heal for the entire fight (~5-7 min). This meant you needed to be able to use potions, demonic runes and anything else you could to keep your mana regenerated for the entire time. If you stopped casting this heal your raid generally wiped. (sometimes you got really lucky, but it was rare)

The fight was also a DPS race, he had a 7 minute enrage timer. You needed to beat that timer. This meant that while the DPS couldn't move in right away, they needed to max out DPS as much as possible. We wiped many times with perfect execution from tanks/healers and just not enough DPS.

You mention people ""just pressing fireball"" this was because abilities weren't like they are now. You didn't have multiple viable specs to choose from or unique options. You had a best rotation and a best spec. Want to DPS as a pally? good luck. Ret could auto-attack with seal of command up, and spend the rest of their GCDs refreshing buffs (oh and judgement as well). Rolled a druid? You're a healer. (barring a few rare exceptions). There were no alliance shaman or horde pallys, if you were alliance you didn't get bloodlust/heroism or any similar buff, you got paladins instead, this meant that if a fight was tuned to a specific amount of DPS (see patchwerk above) you needed more gear to get through it. 

It's not that people were ""bad"" at playing the game as you put it, it's more that the game wasn't as friendly as it is now. The game wasn't made as user friendly back then, it didn't hold your hand through things. There weren't anywhere near the number of mods there are now, and they weren't anywhere near as advanced. We didn't have deadly boss mods to tell us when to move out of things or when a boss ability would come, we had to pay attention/listen on vent. We also didn't have the global resources like we do now. There wasn't a place like icyveins or askmrrobot where you could go for gear/spec advice and tips, or to learn your rotation. You had to browse the forums or figure it out for yourself. 

There wasn't a ""normal"" or ""heroic"" mode, the boss was either hard or it wasn't. 


Another specific example I thought I'd mention:

Archimonde. This fight was a BEAR. Here's the thing. Every time someone dies, he gains an orb floating around him. This orb he can unleash whenever (random from raid POV) and did a ton of damage plus some ability BASED ON THE CLASS OF THE PERSON WHO DIED. This ability usually killed more people. Meaning more orbs, meaning more people dead, meaning more orbs, see where this is going?

Find me a fight these days where you have to be perfect, not a single death from anything. Even a lot of the world first kills were ""half the raid is dead race to kill the boss"" this didn't happen on a fight like Archi, if half the raid is dead, the rest is following almost immediately.

I wish I *didn't* know, but I know which girl was prostituting herself for drug money, whose parent is probably hitting them, and which kid had to move in with their aunt because step-dad molested him. I know which girls were pregnant and then had abortions, and which girl was pregnant by her *boyfriend* (consensual) and which was raped. 

I know a good bit of the petty drama: when they start dating, and when they break up. Who is friends, and who isn't. You bring your dislike of your classmates to the realm of bullying, and I will end that shit. 

I see you texting in class, and I only call you on it about 50% of the time to help drive home the message that it's about discretion, since, really, everyone does as an adult too. I see you eating even when i told you to put the food away. I know that the 1:14 ""bathroom break"" is a quick rendezvous with your girlfriend, because it happens *every* day. 

I usually know who cheated on school work, and I only call someone one it when it's (A) egregious, and (B) will actually make a huge difference in life. (Going off to college? No, you don't get to cheat your way through my class. Desperately trying to eke out your last 3 credit instead of dropping out? I don't care quite as much.)

A lot of kids in my class are like me, and come from relatively stable homes and have relatively normal lives. But *way* more kids than I expected deal with shit I didn't even know existed when I was their age. I'm not their therapist or social worker, so all I can do is create a safe space where they can leave their shit at the door and focus on normal kid classes and homework an tests, and pretend that I believe their cover story.

Then I moved on, and then I decided again to do the ""moves"" with another girl, you know, flirt, talk, get along, and then after some time I when to her and said how much I like her, and then she said no, just no by moving her hand with a no sign. I was devasted, we were so close, we would go to concerts, beaches, restaurants, walk on the seashore, several hours talking on the phone.

I will commonly see vets pick up the fight mechanics within seconds because they learn. Newbie players seem to need mechanics drilled into them a hundred times over before they understand to not stand in the fire.

THIS

I raided for a long time vanilla through ICC - People give me crap because I came back to the game about 2 months ago. As soon as I had the iLVL I jumped into LFR - AS A TANK. 

Without watching a single video or reading strats. I was able to figure out the bulk of the fights (I still have no idea what some abilities do - especially as if I'm a DPS - I'm finding this out the hard way on my warlock). Generally, I was able to get a quick (like 1-2 sentence) run down from the other tank. Or I could look at the buff, see what it does and figure it out from there. ""Oh, this debuff he puts on the tank causes you to take more damage from an ability, gonna have to taunt back and forth."" ""Hey, that boss has sunder armor, gonna have to swap"" ""Oh look adds spawn, probably need to tank those"". etc. This comes from experience of having to actually learn a fight and think for yourself instead of having something like DBM to tell you ""run out of the fire"" or ""ability is casting now"".

Saying that, I'm all for people going in blind to content. Just when using public matchmaking, like the duty finder, then expect people to expect more from you. 

I'm lucky I run with a bunch of people who enjoy working out content ourselves. We did turns 1-4 with no guides online (great learning curve for all of us) and i feel we much better understand our classes, the game and the encounters much better than just watching a video and following suit. 

Turn 5 was a mix. We got frustrated with a few bits and read up online. Though it still do that fight slightly different to a lot of the videos online. We found our own way of doing things and I like that.

EDIT: I apologize for getting everyone in a bit of a tizzy. The most important point of my post was obviously unclear.

So someone can call the cops and accuse you of child abuse, but the cops have limited time and resources so they don't pursue bullshit claims. They do due diligence, but they don't waste time and manpower nailing someone who is obviously innocent to a wall. I saw several cases where nasty divorces resulted in abuse and counter abuse charges. The police not only did not persecute anyone, they made it clear to the person(s) reporting that that kind of behavior is not acceptable."
alsomahler,Bitcoin,1390914182.0,"Many providers know that their goods are being used for illegal purposes. Glue manufacturing companies don't stop serving to certain shops because many glue-addicts shop there. It's the responsibility of the shop to stop selling to the addicts. And it's also the responsibility of the shop to order only the maximum allowed amount of glue per day. If the glue manufacturer points out holes in the system, that is their right. Even having their suspicions... without proof it doesn't suddenly make them complicit.

I understand the point of view written in the indictment, but considering we are talking about early 2012, before FinCEN or any government agency even defined bitcoins as money and the fact that BitInstant was already trying to comply with MSB licenses as much as they did, sure makes this case highly questionable. 

Even after having read the supposed e-mails that were sent, nothing in there proves that Charlie was supporting drug-trade. He was telling the person reselling the bitcoins to stick to the maximum and if he really wanted, he should work around it by using multiple e-mail addresses... but nowhere does Charlie actually mention proof that he knew.. only suspicion. As an MSB you need to report suspicious behaviour, but what qualifies as suspicious behavior? The mere fact that you suspect something? Or does a client need to meet certain requirements?"

**Liability only. (aka Basic)** If you want your shit fixed or replace it will be paid through someone elses insurance. In the case that the accident is your fault, you will be replacing your stuff. If your bike is stolen you are SOL. If the other driver doesn't have insurance to fix/replace your bike, you will have to sue them for damages. I call this ""anything happens, no more bike"".

**Comprehensive+Basic** Same for above, except if your stuff gets hit or stolen, you will get covered. And if you hit a rider that's not insured you can get your stuff replaced through insurance. I call this ""something happens to your bike that you couldn't control or reasonably prevent, you're covered"".

**Collision. (aka Full)** Anything happens to you stuff, pay the deductible and you get restored to wholeness.

One should consider adding additional medical coverage for passengers/self, Damage to structures coverage, and personal belonging replacement policies to whatever insurance you carry.

Look at his performance in the playoffs, then call him what you will.

&gt; If you think he is going to ""easily"" ""exploit any weakness"", then I don't even see why you're on here discussing anything. You seem to have your mind made up already how the game is going to go.

&gt; It's as if every other QB and OC in the league is a complete idiot, and can't adjust on the fly, and none of them will be able to see what the GOAT GOD Peyton Manning will be able to see, all on his own.

You make it sound like it's absurd to suggest that Peyton is exceptional in his ability to diagnose defenses and make the right play call at the line of scrimmage. But it's not absurd. He is the best at it. You can capitalize *GOAT GOD* and try to make it sound as silly as you want, but there's a reason that this is the best offense in NFL history. There's a reason that Peyton *is* considered a candidate for greatest QB in the history of the game.  And a whole lot of it has to do with Peyton's ability to diagnose defenses from a pre-snap read and adjust the play call at the line of scrimmage. Does that make every other OC and QB dumb? No. Does it make them not as good at this specific part of the game as Peyton Manning? Yes.

Look, maybe you should read the article that this thread is about. Here it is as quickly as possible:

1. The no-huddle prevents teams from making situational substitutions
2. The Seahawks defense's strength is the depth of situation-specific defensive linemen
3. No team has run much no-huddle against the Seahawks (except for the Colts, somewhat)

So it's not a matter of Peyton being able to exploit a weakness no one else could, it's a matter of Peyton *creating* a weakness via the no-huddle that none of the Seahawks opponents this year attempted.

omnydevotchka,AdviceAnimals,1390917036.0,"Vector does VIRTUAL presentations now! My sister (just graduated from a 2 year college after 3 years) is doing the Vector gig (spending more money than she's making on gas alone). I agreed to a presentation but we live about an hour away from each other and I didn't want her to spend the gas.

 She called me at the appointed time, had me go to a website (which was a PREZI) and click through it as she read from her presentation guide over the phone. It was torture. However I did get to make snarky comments at some of the videos (the knives are quite good, my mom has had a set for a long time, but the presentation of the product was a little odd in some places).

The worst part was when she actually started to get into the sales pitch, ""Which of the two would you prefer, this $3,000 set or this $5,000 set?"" When my SO and I had explained to her ""We have $30 until we get paid again. We can literally buy nothing from you and can't fit a monthly payment into our budget."" 

Luckily my birthday is in March and mom bought me a set in advance and also offered us $100 to purchase something from my sister after her presentation.

NoIdeaJustOneName,NoFap,1390917128.0,"Some studies shows benefits of masturbation, other deny it... anybody who is (or have been) involved in a relationship with very different sex drives can attest it has benefits !

However, there is NO WAY daily masturbation can be good for you. These studies mostly are about fapping once in a while.

Then, why NoFap ? Because it's not about definitely avoiding masturbation (it can be, but for many people it isn't). It is about QUITTING AN ADDICTION to masturbation. 

To quit an addiction, you need to avoid any contact with the addictive stuff for some time (the time your brain needs to ""reboot"", 3 months at least for NoFap, but your milleage may vary).

Once you're cured, you have a clear mind to decide wether you masturbate or not. I'll personnaly wait 3 or 4 months clear before deciding anything since I'm still influenced by my dopamine-wanting brain. 

Be careful : you will be tempted to ""try and see if it changed anything"", I had this phenomenon after 34 days... it doesn't bring anything. That's only your brain trying to rationalize...
