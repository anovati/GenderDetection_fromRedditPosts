She was raised to put the needs of others before herself. It's one of the parts of being ""lady-like."" She also has a very strong, independent streak. That comes from her beliefs that even benign sexism is unacceptable. 

Mix these together and you've got a recipe for a woman who feels super guilty about anyone doing anything at all for her, especially if she's the one asking.

Your friend mentioned she was cold. Your reaction may have made her think you mistook her complaint for a request. Your reaction may have just taken her by surprise as she didn't realize that what she said could be taken as a request. 

She may also have taken your offer of the coat as flirting on your part. Being a gentleman is seem by some as flirtation. Her reaction says that she didn't expect flirting from you and wanted to make sure her understanding was correct. You didn't continue to flirt, so false alarm.

meowmixxed,xxfitness,1389488653.0,"I'll just say what worked for me.

I was in a similar situation: anxiety and depression, with a nice dose of EDNOS-bordering-on-bulimia. I counted calories and I lost 35 pounds in 3 months. Counting calories was fucking with my head so I stopped, and I gained 50 pounds in around 4 months.  

Fast forward to a few months of counseling for EDNOS and group therapy, and I gave up on all of it. It was driving me crazy. The girls in my group were 4-5 years younger than me, which isn't a lot, but they were 18/19 and I was 22/23. That's kind of a huge difference. And they all had family support, and my family didn't care and wasn't helpful.

So I dropped therapy because it made me feel bad. I stopped reading weight loss blogs. I stopped going on /r/fitness or /r/xxfitness. I basically spent 3 months ignoring ANYTHING that had to do with food. I only focused on eating when I was hungry, and asking myself before I ate ""Do I really want this, or am I just eating?""

I went from binging 3-4 times a week to maybe 1-2 times a month. Then I started just adding ""healthy foods"" that made me feel good. Most of this was just eating veggies and having vegetarian days (that weren't just carbs with the occasional veggies - I ate a lot of protein, beans, and vegetables mixed in). 

I haven't weighed myself in 3 months. I have a ballpark of what I think I weigh. I started lifting at the gym and doing a class with some friends  that focuses on strength training and cardio. I have gained muscle mass and my lifts have gone up and I feel better.

But it wasn't easy. My group class is going to add mirrors to the room we work out in and it is going to be a huge ordeal to be able to go after that. I know it's silly but it's a huge issue for me. I got married last week and I saw all the pictures my friends took (even the bad ones) and I was shocked. I became conscious of my size and my dress was unflattering from certain angles. So then I was kind of back to square one for a day, I missed my workout. I ate some cake.

I'm not better. But I had to slip into it. I think if you focus on wellness, strength, fitness, and just being active, the weight will follow.

In the past, I've been in a V as the hinge for a while, and very briefly in another V as a branch. Both included my current partner.

Since I've only been in Vs, I can't really answer what other structures I liked. I enjoyed being in a V, I think a N would be great, and a square even better. I have nothing against a triad, but being straight I would require two bi guys, and my current partner is straight, and I have no plan on breaking it off with him, so to be in a triad I would need two more partners, both bi men, both interested in me, to be interested in both, and for them to also be interested in each other.

So in my case, it doesn't seem very likely, but I'm open to the idea if it ever presents itself.

Relationship structure doesn't matter much to me, but I think if I was in a very long-term V, I would worry that the branches would feel left out, lonely or bitter if they wish they had another partner too."

However, I'll give you my two cents since I probably already got you excited. 

Personally, I feel like the smartwatch market is still very rough (Read: brand new). Nobody really knows what anybody needs/wants out of an ""accessory to your smartphone."" A true ""smartwatch"" has yet to be developed [although there are different watches that independently act as a phone, a SMS center, a camera, a video recorder, a walkie talkie, a mini video screen (so you can watch your porn at work, secretly)]

I've also noticed that any of the more expensive watches aren't as great as they seem (I.e. Galaxy Gear). 

But I digress. Right now, there are(as of today), by my count, there are two decent ""accessories to your smartphone"" out, the metawatch (strata and frame), and the Pebble(I happen to have both). Each of them shine in their own way. The metawatch watches look like a watch you'd get your geek son in the 80s or 90s for his birthday and they have a screen that looks very rough (think 8-bit graphics) but it gets the job done. Need to see the time? Who texted you last? want to know the weather before you get out of bed? It can do all these and more, however, the metawatch doesn't seem to have as much developer power behind it (at least for iOS). You're pretty much stuck with the things the original devs give you. 

Now, to the point in question, Pebble, the Pebble watch looks a lot nicer, it looks more polished and professional, both the inside and outside. The Pebble's outsides looks more polished and something a professional would wear, but it can double as a sports watch or a casual watch. The the screen and the software are much more end-user friendly. 

Both the watches I've mentioned above offer a lot of the same things (some features that metawatches have ATM will be released for pebble on the 2.0 firmware update. So not all the features that overlap will work for Pebble 1.xx out of the box). 

I'll sum this all up very easy in my TL;DR, but before I go, if searching this sub doesn't answer anything, google &gt;&gt;smartwatch&lt;&lt; reviews (where smartwatch is the smartwatch you're interested in).

**TL;DR** ease of access to on-screen widgets/apps but less third-party developer support &gt; polished design/functionality and lots of apps/watch faces/games/etc? Metawatch (strata or frame). Vice versa? Pebble without a doubt"

CloudDrone,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1389489081.0,"Even though It was recorded on a zoom, I felt like the guitars were played a little too loud.

You guys have some work to do on finding the tempo. I feel like the guitars were trying to play out over the top and ahead of everything. With repetetive mantra-like riffs like this, the drums really need to be glued to a grid like a metronome, and the guitars really have to listen hard to the drums. If the guitars aren't locked in with the drums, you get a little bit of separated earnestness where it sounds like everyone is trying to climb over each other to make it to the end. 

Focusing on locking in to the drummer, trusting the drummer by listening to them, and making sure that the drummer knows they are the heartbeat that drives this song, would all help to glue this together and make it work better.

If everyone eases  up and relaxes into a consistent tempo and rhythm, it might be easier to get some vocal stuff in there. 

The next time you guys play, focus on listening really hard to eachother. Don't turn your brain off and zone out on the patterns you're playing. Listen to the other people. If you can't feel and hear what the other people are playing, you're either too busy, too loud, or too absorbed in yourself.

This advice isn't directed at any one person in particular, its just what I might be hearing in this particular recording.

Either way, it sounds fun, and has a lot of potential."

RoseOfSharonCassidy,AskWomen,1389490175.0,"500 Days of Summer is one of my favorite movies.  Summer (Zooey Deschanel's character) is *supposed* to annoy the hell out of you.  Throughout the whole movie, you're seeing their relationship through the eyes of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character).  Summer is ""perfect"" because that's the only way that Tom can see her.  He puts her on a pedestal and doesn't understand that she's a real person with real flaws until after the breakup, when you see Summer acting cold and distant.  At that point the viewer is supposed to think, ""wow, she wasn't perfect, she was actually a horrible person"" (even though Tom is still in love with her).  Then towards the end, Summer gets engaged and has a talk with Tom, and you realize that Summer wasn't so bad at all.  She just wasn't into Tom; that's not a crime.  She was always very honest about what she wanted out of the relationship, but [he didn't listen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vLovb0AesI) and he got himself hurt.

I think that Zooey Deschanel was the perfect choice for that role, because the viewer has to see her the way that Tom sees her.  I don't think there's another actress alive who could've done that part half as well as well as she did."

But one girl, way back, I went out with for several months before getting down to doing the whole sex thing. At the time it seemed appropriate because I sensed she was not really ready. Otherwise I really desired her as a friend.

With all the women (girls) I slept with I never asked how many other men, how did my dick (average) measure up, and how was I on a scale of 1 to 10. I felt their sexual history was private and to ask about it would put them on an uncomfortable spot. It would be the equivalent of peeking at them in the bathroom or through the bedroom window.

I pull aggro pretty easy without him in DF though - I wait though for them to pull first but if I'm getting aggro after then that's a tank issue.

I've started levelin war and pld recently and I'm quite enjoying it. I lose aggro when I run out of mp and tp but that's an issue with me and not the DPS or healers (no matter their gear). If you flash a few times then you shouldn't lose aggro to high level ppl in DF as easily.

But it also rides the sexist, racist, and libertarian bandwagons as well. And anyone who disagrees is downvoted. There is almost no intelligent discussion on these topics, they're just shunted. And I think that may just be a result of reddit's demographics and target audience (in the same way the Tumblr is kind of the opposite).

lemonylips,AskWomen,1389490898.0,"It's 2014- online dating isn't a taboo anymore.  It's pretty normal.

I've found play partners, fuck buddies, friends with benefits, just normal platonic friends, and long term boyfriends online.

I think it's a harmful cliche to assume that ""the true, best and most amazing relationships and love comes from two friends who just happen to hang out and fall for each other.""  Plenty of people who date their friends end up in a flaming pile of shitty break up drama.  Plenty of them work out.  Same with online relationships.  You can't gauge the potential success of a relationship based on where you meet someone- and sometimes you gotta make a point to put yourself out there.  Meet people you wouldn't otherwise cross paths with.  Broaden your scope.

And if there's no chemistry, who cares?  You're going on a *date*.  You're not committing to anything at all.  You don't have to fall in love with them.  You don't even have to *like* them.  You're just meeting up and seeing how it goes.  It might be awkward, it might not be.  There might be an instant spark or conversation might be slow to build.  You might be annoyed by everything they do or you might find them incredibly endearing.  You're going on the date so you can figure that shit out.

edit: I love online dating because it allows me to be extremely upfront about certain things *before I even choose to meet someone*.  If you read my profile and are turned off by my attitudes towards sex or my line or work or my sense of humor, I don't even have to waste time talking to you.  And it allows me to similarly window shop other people.  The quality of dates I've set up online has been much higher than those I've set up by just happening to meet someone IRL and I credit that to this ability to weed people out and vet them before meeting.  It also feels very low-pressure.  If we agree to get drinks and it doesn't work out or it's awkward or we fuck and the sex is horrible- I can effectively cut you out of my life and not much has changed.  I don't have to answer to my classmate or my coworker or your sister about why things are suddenly weird between me and Johnny now, ya know?  Idk.  Online dating has a lot of upsides.  Which isn't to say it's a magical dating solution- it's just another road to stroll down."

Ingmundar,videos,1389491136.0,"Because it came from a movement that focused on gaining suffrage, trying to enact laws against domestic abuse, and trying to get equal access to the workforce for women. Even today where a lot of positive steps have been taken, women are still shunted in a lot of ways. Women don't even make-up 1/4 members of government in Canada (and fewer in the US). Pay is still not equal. Considerations for family planning are still lacking in most places. Almost every woman I know has at least one story of being followed, harassed, and sometimes assaulted by a man.

There are also problems for men in society. One of the main ones is our own version of self-image issues, where men are seen as hyper-masculine and emotionless. This creates body and psychological issues in a lot of the same ways modern fashion engenders in women, but is not talked about. From a feminist perspective this is a remanent of patriarchy. 

Now we could always call it something else. I think any sensible person believes in what feminism stands for, even if they don't consider themselves to be a feminist. So it makes you happy to have another word, that's okay."

You don't have the online date with the intention of finding a bf/gf- you actually probably shouldn't (I certainly never have).  You should date with the intention of meeting new people and making new connections.  If those connections happen to flourish into a long term commitment then that's great and not at all dissimilar to your trope of two friends who fall in love when they weren't expecting to.

Avistew,polyamory,1389491729.0,"Okay, now that I've been able to answer the questionnaire, here are my comments. I know you can't change it but the feedback might be useful for later.

When asked about oral sex, I had no clue if the question meant giving or receiving oral sex. My answers would be drastically different for one or the other, so that's unpractical. I decided to assume receiving since the questionnaire has so much focus on the participant's pleasure vs the partner's pleasure.

I would have liked to see ""because I enjoy pleasing my partner sexually"" as a reason to have sex. I find it's more of a reason for me than my own sexual pleasure. If I just want sexual pleasure, I can masturbate. Similarly, I would have liked to be able to answer ""because I love my partner"" as a reason to have sex. Instead it was full of things like ""to feel better about myself"" or ""because I'm being forced to"".

Just like SkyNinja7, I found it impractical to have so many questions with ""one week"" or ""1-3 times a day"". What if it's 2-6 times a week? Then neither is accurate.

To prevent that kind of problem, if you don't want to add more possible answer, rephrasing it would work. For instance ""between once a day and once a week"" as an option.

Like FallCat, I had issues with the phrasing of some of the questions. For ""I prefer one long term relationship"" if I say ""no"", I am put as ""does not like long-term relationships"" even though I meant ""I prefer more than one at once""?

It mentioned ""solitary sex with a partner"" on a few occasions. While I think it probably means ""masturbating while in a relationship"", it's a bit confusing.

I had some problems with some of the ""arousal"" questions. There were a few things I found mildly repulsive and mildly arousing at the same time. Actually, I would say some things might be arousing purely because they are also repulsive.

""Repulsive"" to me insinuates disgusts. Some of the things did not disgust me, but instead scared me for instance. I noted it as repulsion, but I feel it was not accurate.

I liked being given the option to enter more activities, but I would have liked to be given the option to comment on my answers for the various parts, so I could have clarified whenever I was forced to answer something that wasn't true because it was the closest option.

I wish I had been asked about polyamory. I was only asked how many partners I have currently (I happen to only have one right now) and whether I had ever had group sex. Then there were questions that involved ""sex with others while in a long-term relationship"" but it sounded like it implied casual sex, rather than another long-term relationship."

redundanteater,bourbon,1389491973.0,"Delaware Phoenix Single Barrel Artisanal Bourbon Whiskey, 100 proof (a New York bourbon with 69% corn, 18% rye and 13% barley sourced from the Finger Lakes Area) Price: about $35 for a half bottle (375 mm)

Atmosphere: Hanging out with my eldest prior to him going off to do army stuff. Then again a few days later, though dreading it.

Presentation: It looked scary so I limited it to a single ounce in a shot glass. I let it gasp for breath out for about an hour to try to mellow it out. Second time was an ounce neat in that same shot glass. I couldn't quite steel myself up for tasting it for about 40 minutes. Eventually, I just had to get it done.

Appearance: Unbelievably light, like a newish corn whiskey had been put in the wrong bottle. In real life, it doesn't look anything like its publicity shots, and even my own photograph is way way way too dark. This is a very very very light colored bourbon.

Nose: Acetone and vape-o-rub but with a slight hint of something more, like a creature whose blood was vanilla had been stabbed halfheartedly in the belly and was now bleeding on my floor. After about 40 minutes, an almost tequila-like smell can be barely detected.

Taste &amp; mouth: Open and soft mouth feel, which is odd considering that it's 100 proof, but within a second or two it really starts to come across like tequila. I can't explain it fully, but it lodges around your bottom gums and tingles, with some sort of warm but unpleasant sensation blundering into the sinuses. There's definitely a sugary base note, something that I think would transmogrify into caramel given time and enough oak. It's a powerfully undeveloped taste, but unified. It comes across as intentional but young, like I'm watching a fight in pee wee hockey, and I just know that one day these kids will really be able to land a few.

Finish: It's boozy and slightly unpleasant, but I do sense that it might be really awesome one day in about 1461 days.

Overall: really disappointed for the tremendous expense, but I think this distillery has promise. I feel really badly slagging on this one. On the web site, the dude who makes it looks like a really straight up fella who cares for the craft. I tell that a lot of love went into this, but it needs to finish school before it tries looking for a job.

lemonylips,AskWomen,1389492541.0,"I think most people online see ""dating"" as just that, going on dates.  No commitment unless it's been agreed upon.  Just getting together, enjoying each others time and company, having sex if it leads there.  That's what dating means to me at least.  The best way to find out what people's intentions are is to ask them.  Ask them what they're looking for, what they're comfortable with, what they're experience has been with online dating, what they've found in the past, what they're hoping to find in the future.

I think that the best way to approach online dating is with an attitude of ""let's see where this goes.""  Cause, really, you don't want a relationship unless all the pieces fall into place, ya know?  So you'll message for a bit and if it goes well you'll agree to meet up.  If you meet up and you have good conversation, maybe you'll set up a dinner date.  If dinner goes well maybe you'll do it again.  If you want to maybe you'll fuck.  If you keep enjoying each other's company then you'll keep spending time together.  If it gets to a point where you need a commitment to be made, you'll ask for one.  **But none of that is a goal.**  The goal is just to put yourself out there and *see where it goes.*  Would you like to find a relationship at some point?  Sure.  Do you need it right now?  No.  Right now you just need to enjoy the moment- or leave if you aren't enjoying it :P"

As a result, I've become better friends with an ex's wife than I am with him, am in good standing with the other wives and girlfriends (some of whom are also reciprocal of my friendship), and have formed the opinion that as long as you steer clear of saying or doing anything that could actually be perceived as being creepy (including giving a cold shoulder to their partner), mature adults who can be cool with friends that used to be more but clearly aren't now *do* exist.

D.A.R.E. came in and showed us pictures of lungs after too much smoking and lots of pictures of people after heroin and meth abuse. I only really remember hearing about meth, cocaine, and heroin. They also told us that people would huff the fumes from spray paint, and that smoking meth is like smoking nail polish remover. No mention of psychedelics at all; I'm not sure I even knew they existed at that point. Meth/cocaine/heroin/tobacco get the most media coverage, and they taught us that they will addict you instantly and fuck up your life. 

Obviously, they can't teach responsible drug use in the way sex ed should teach responsible sex instead of abstinence. But I think it makes it more dangerous to demonize all drugs, because once people realize that, say, smoking weed doesn't actually kill you or ruin your life forever, and then the things that *are* true, like how smoking kills, seem like lies also."

[Competitive decks all hover around 1,000 tickets for the most part](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/legacy)

But if I put all my tickets into legacy, I won't be able to play other formats for a long time, as Legacy is the hardest and will take a lot of practice to start winning anything. I think it would be the most fun, but Modern is much easier to play and I can jump right into playing DEs. That's why I was maybe trying to find a Modern deck that uses a lot of the same pieces as a Legacy deck. I don't have enough for Jund though. 

&gt;also build a standard deck once BOTG is online.

Yeah, I'll probably wait until the new set comes out.

&gt;There are just so many standard tournaments every day that any small losses you may incur due to price fluctuation will be heavily offset by your winnings.

Good point. It's not as risky as Modern or Legacy. I'm really worried that if I buy LEDs or something, that Wizards is going to make a promo and give everyone a LED online. "

He was extremely affectionate, even in public; he held my hand, kissed me, paid for my meals, and when I would leave in the mornings, he would say very ""coupley"" things.

AS for longer drags and bigger clouds. That is my domain. Well I am not the master of it. Yet, but I go with RBA/RDAs because they give much, oh so much, more flavor. However this is also dependent on wire gauge, air hole size, and oh so many more variables.

Lower ohms, and higher heat levels help with nicotine absorption. This is also the same place where flavor shows up in abundance. Some devices like the KayFun/Russian can do this in the 1 to 1.5 ohm range. Drippers and the like have larger air holes than the KayFun. Once you have larger holes your wire gauge and air hole size goes up. For me that is a dual coil .5 ohm dripper set up. That is twisted 28 gauge, for one ohm each coil. I am also at a higher voltage and wattage than most.

Willravel,LifeProTips,1389494559.0,"Repeated Neosporin use can and does lead to dermatitis, it's really expensive, and the overuse of antibacterial agents is creating an optimum environment for antibacterial-resistent strains of bacteria. So, no. Neosporin is for occasional use on minor cuts when you don't have immediate access to cleaning supplies like soap and water. It's almost certainly not killing the bacteria that are responsible for your smelly balls. 

If you want clean testicles, clean your testicles. Use body soap and an exfoliating scrubber of some kind and make sure to scrub everywhere when you shower. The soap bonds to oils carrying dirt and dead skin cells, and the scrubber removes dead skin cells, and then the soap links with water and allows you to rinse clean. The most important step is getting and keeping dry. Dry off completely with a clean towel, then air-dry to make sure you're totally dry, then make sure you're wearing pants that breathe. If you're going to be active, dress accordingly with boxers or boxer briefs that wick sweat away from the body like microfiber. With all due respect, this is all part of basic person hygiene. 

If actually washing and drying your testicles isn't sufficient to prevent the smell, see a dermatologist. When you're at the dermatologist's office, have a good laugh about the idea of putting a $15 tube of Neosporin on your taint. "

This being said, it's a shame if the only reception you had was about complaining that there were no females. On the other hand, if it was bought by the same people who bought your first book (which only has females in it), it's quite possible they expected it to only include female pirates (thinking it was your shtick) or at least some, especially if they were buying it for their daughter to identify with.

Fast-forward to 7ths grade Health class and all of a sudden they show us a picture of a ""normal"" penis on the screen, with this weird droopy skin dangling off of it. Suddenly the two and two clicked in my mind and it was a big ""AHA!"" moment. Turned out I was circumcised and didn't even know it until I hit puberty. So having only known what a circumcised penis looks like, suddenly seeing a normal one was sort of a shock. It looked weird and unattractive to me, but that's only because of what I grew up knowing and thinking was ""normal"". I don't think there's any health or great benefits to being circumcised or un-circumcised - it's more an aesthetic difference.

As for drilled out air holes. That is more for RBA/RDA type atomizers. However you can drill out the air holes on the Mini Protank 2. i have done it to my Mini PT2. It is possible to do it to the PT2, but ill advised as it will weaken the mounting point.

Back to the RBA/RDA air holes. Larger air holes means more vapor. This also means thicker gauges wire or twisted wire. Most people Drill their air holes out because the stock air holes have gotten to small for their tastes. For me my air holes are about 2.6 mm or 5/32nds. Most RDAs start at less than 1/16th.

I would recommend getting the CCI spring kit as they come with three different mainsprings (red for strong, silver for regular, blue for weak). If you didn't want to go that route you could try clipping your spring to get it down to a safe velocity (cut one coil at a time!).

If you don't believe in an afterlife, the person who's now gone wont notice a thing. The people who will notice are the people who need to clean up the mess, the loved ones walking in on a dead body or the people used to commit suicide, like train drivers. 

As it is, the suicide bar is very high, and it could be argued that the bar for euthanasia is even higher. After all, you need to vocalize your desire to die, and if the permission isn't granted you'll be 'stuck' with people trying to prevent you from committing suicide. Which in itself doesn't have to be a bad thing. Just by offering the possibility you'll have people finally talking to someone about their desire to die, and perhaps catch the people for whom there's still an other solution.

Slightly off-topic from the scene:

If I had to guess I'd say one reason I didn't buy the scene was because, personally, I never felt *any* chemistry between Tidus and Yuna. In all honesty the part of the plot that actually got me hooked was the ongoing battle with Sin and Yuna's struggle with the feeling of duty and her own martyr complex.

Don't worry about the long reply time either! :D 

HRT has to be covered by insurance providers by law in the state of California. So I lucked out there. Also, the bottom surgery is also sometimes covered under employee benefits at companies. A trans person can transition with no surgeries at all, it's not required to complete transition. 

I appreciate the stance of live and let live. The world would be a better place if everyone just let each other do their thing so long as that thing wasn't hurting others. 

&gt;I don't really look up transsexuals, but the ones I've seen...

This brings up an interesting point that I'd like to make about trans invisibility. You say ""the ones I've seen"". Exactly, they are the more visible members of the trans community. They are far from the majority too. People assume trans people look like ""men in dresses"" (which is kind of offensive, but I won't go into it) because those are the only trans people they see. The trans women like myself and many others whom people can't tell are trans, remain the invisible majority. It's why I feel it's important for me to be visible. 

This brings up an interesting idea I'd like to give you. If you see a beautiful woman, and you have -no idea- she's trans from looking at her, how do you tell she's trans? If she tells you and your response is ""You don't look trans."", think about that. If she's trans then she by definition looks trans. 

This is a similar issue as the one faced by bisexual folks. How do you tell someone is bi by looking at them? If a guy is dating a guy, he's presumed gay. If a girl is dating a girl, she's presumed lesbian. If a man and a woman are dating, they are both presumed straight. It's this issue of invisibility based solely on ""looks"" that can cause some issues for people. Be it the de-legitimizing of bisexual people, who are told bisexuality isn't real, or the plight of trans women who are told they'll look like men in dresses simply because that's the only visible part of a much larger whole.

Avistew,polyamory,1389498391.0,"That makes me curious about some things.

- What makes you think ""sometimes life forces you to choose""?
- Why do you think you'd be the one left behind?
- If this is how you feel about relationships, what made you get into polyamory in the first place?

It seems to me your way of thinking just doesn't go hand in hand with polyamory.

I must be missing a lot of details. From this post and your previous one, what I get it:

Your girlfriend has another partner she's been to long term. The relationship evolving, as relationship tend to, they decided to move together (not unusual in long-term relationships). They did not talk about it with you despite the fact that you live there too and therefore you would become roommates, which affects you.

You feel that her moving with him makes your relationship with her worth less, or even worthless. It's still not clear to me why.

You withdrew from both of them, needing space. Finally you went back and both of them are concerned about you. You are upset that they did not realise you would take it that badly. You want to break up. You had sex, possibly to ""re-establish your territory"", considering the rest of your posts is full of rivalry.

So, while I wish you did not feel bad, and hope the situation gets better, I just cannot relate or understand. It seems to me you went into polyamory thinking you would be her only committed relationship, but never let her know. It seems to me you assumed her relationships would never evolve in the same way yours has, but never let her know. It seems to me you assumed her relationship goals, values and plans matched yours, but you guys never talked about it to check.

Now, I may be completely off-base. She might have told you that moving together is actually not a component she's interested in for her intimate relationships (except the one with you) and that therefore it would never happen. But both your posts look like you just assumed it would not happen and never bothered to challenge that assumption.

You know that she has an interest in living with people she's in a relationship with, since she did so with you. You also know that she has another long-term relationship. So the fact that you are surprised by her wanting him to move in with you just boggles my mind, and the fact that you take it as a downgrade baffles me (if she wasn't interested in continuing her relationship with you, she'd have moved with him, not had him move with you).

I'm missing the part where she told you she didn't want to live with you anymore, or otherwise told you she wanted her relationship with you to be less committed than before. All I see is you assuming so because someone else is moving in, even though she seemed to go out of her way to make sure your relationship with her does not change (as shown by the ""still living with you as well"" part).

I agree you guys are not compatible and that it's a shame. You obviously are interested in a kind of relationship with one committed partner, and one or more casual partners that should not become committed. She works differently. I get that. What I don't get is how you never realised that difference in the way you view relationships until just now.

...I realise none of this is very encouraging or reassuring on my part. I'm sorry about that. I can assure you if your GF was the one posting here, I would also tell her to look at yourself for the mistakes she's made (you should definitely have been involved in the decision, and not told after the fact).

The way I see it, considering how you reacted, I don't think there is anyway for this relationship to work happily again. But you could save a lot of trouble in future relationships by thinking about the questions I'm raising here, and having discussions with future partners that involve these issues.

And I have to admit, I'm also very curious about how that could happen in the first place."

Try sword base literally anywhere on any map for as long as you want since you can have two team mates grabbing bubbleshields to keep it up indefinitely.

Meanwhile grav lifts in close quarters can totally lock down doorways, bubbleshields allow players to camp indefinitely, deployable cover makes any long ranged battle into armor lock only you can actually attack, power drains are the new noob combo, and the addition of fire grenades and a flamethrower on a couple maps mean players can basically combine the power of a shotgun/sword with the area denial of a gravity lift.

&gt; But churches aren't (or aren't supposed to be) businesses. Most put every dollar not spent on cost of living towards charities or charitable works. Most priests and pastors don't live in houses any where near as nice as a CEO's. Yeah, there are the bad apples which grab the spot light, but those are few and far between. The theory is, the money gained by taxing churches would be spent mostly on the same things that the charities provide. Not taxing them just takes out the middle man.     

or /u/poundedout45     
&gt;You all do realize that pretty much every non profit that files as a 501c has officers like CEOs or CFOs. These officers are almost always compensated very well. In fact, any 501c has a tax return available online at guidestar.com, or at least did when I was a research assistant. So by this logic, we should be taxing PETA, NORML, and Goodwill. And a pastor does pay taxes. Look up the IRS code on the earnings of clergy. They are still subject to federal income tax. Do some research next time."

And multiplayer, while far from perfect, was leaps and bounds ahead of bubbleshield camping shotguns on every map and grav lift doorway denials.

Don't forget the Book of Abraham mis-translations, the anachronisms in the book of mormon, the numerous false prophecies of Joseph Smith (pay especial attention to his prophesying the downfall of the United States, though feel free to also mention the quakers that live on the moon), the fact that the LDS church invests its tithing money in for-profit shopping malls, the absurdity of the temple rituals (and of course their near-exact similarity with masonic rituals that, contrary to popular mormon cultural opinion, have their roots in 17th century English freemasonry and are not claimed by anyone connected to their origin to have any link whatsoever with the rituals practiced in solomon's temple), the translation process of the book of mormon that involved Joe Smith putting his face in a hat and using a seer stone and not the breastplate and goggles of popular mormon culture, and of course, how can we forget, the commonplace practice of ""lying for the lord"" and the deliberate obfuscations, lies, cover-ups and misdirections the church leadership uses to try and cover up all of the embarrassing truths about its history.

I'm sure you will still ""feel the spirit"" when talking about all of that though."

ed8020,AdviceAnimals,1389501597.0,"&gt;So people that work in retail should be doubly punished for shoplifting, accountants should be doubly punished for fudging numbers, athletes should be doubly punished for cheating/fixing games, etc.

Now that's just plain fucking stupid. If you're going to take issue with what I said then why not take issue with, you know, what I ACTUALLY said.

&gt;You don't elect police officers, they sign up for it.

And I said **all public officials**, nothing about elected. I also didn't take any particular issue with LEO. But they didn't just ""sign up"" for it. They are ""sworn in"" to fill a unique role in our society and are allotted an extreme level of trust and should be held to a higher standard. They don't just hire on like some Walmart clerk. They take an oath of office. That alone denotes the very special role they play in society. They DO NOT have to take on this role, it's one THEY CHOOSE. And it's one that's CRUCIAL to any society. 

I don't hate cops. I have made a point several times here on reddit to mention how much respect I have for the Washington State Patrol. They are the most professional and respectful police force I have ever dealt with. And I have NEVER had a bad experience with ANY police force, though I have met a couple cops who scared me a bit, but for the most part they were just doing their job. The worst experience I've ever had ended with the words, ""Well, you scared the hell out of me, but you were nice about it"". I am of the firm and often reaffirmed opinion that if you show them respect they'll give it right back. So don't try and rope me in with all the ACTUAL cop haters that are around here.

As for the problem with politicians and bankers, it is shown FAR too often that they are held to a lesser standard. And while it's true that bankers are in the private sector, when you can crash the entire fucking economy and rely on the people of the US to bail you out, you should get a bit more punishment than having the company pay the fines from a few weeks profits and still get your bonus.

behindtimes,truegaming,1389501674.0,"Yes, I have cheated in an online game.

Demon's Souls.  I tend to play offline, but every once in awhile I'll forget to set the state.  Unfortunately, the game has a memory leak that excessive playing can sometimes corrupt your save game.  I lost a legitimate level 140ish character and just didn't feel like regrinding from the ground up.  So I used the item dupe trick that is well known.

Also Wordament (a boggle like game).  I got all the achievements legitimately except for one, which required a minimum of 250k score when in a good game, you'd be likely only to get a few hundred points.  Anyway, I was browsing YouTube and saw someone made a [Wordament playing robot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrSKFnSg3bU).  He was using Excel to do some calculations on the words, and it was horribly inefficient.  So, I decided I could do better and build my own.  I also decided it would be fun if the thing could learn on it's own how to play, and I made it language independent.  If it found a word on it's own, it would add it to a dictionary, plus at the end of the game, the game showed you a list of the words, so it would also add some of those words too.  To make thing even more interesting, it would also try to work out rules to how words were spelled.  For instance, it would figure out that with many nouns, you can add an s or es to pluralize it.  Or it would learn how to conjugate a verb.   (Yes, it would also figure out what type of speech the word was too).

I don't really condone cheating online (I couldn't care less what a person does in a solo game), so I had it playing Wordament in Arabic, as at best, there would only be 3-4 other people playing.  I limited it to only 40 words from the dictionary before it started it's guessing game, but apparently it became much smarter than what I was anticipating, and started averaging 100+ words per game just on rules that it had picked up."

Downsides: My appetite is gone, which is bad because I'm already underweight. My period has now become like the floodgates of hell. I'm anemic, but it ties in with the loss of appetite and heavy period. My libido is constantly fluctuating from one extreme to the next (but on my last B.C, I had zero libido, so a rollercoaster one is significantly better. So kind of a plus, in a way).

My particular version starts with half a cut of tri-tip, dry aged a bit for extra flavor, salted and peppered, and cooked in a cast-iron skillet with a little olive oil and butter. While this is going, I leave it for whatever amount of time it takes on each three sides and crack three eggs into a saucepan on medium-low heat with maybe a tablespoon of butter and whisk it like crazy. It's basically [Gordon Ramsay's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0) scrambled eggs, which are really creamy. I generally add chives, salt and pepper, though occasionally I toss in just a bit of cheese like gruyere or fontina. Finally, I'll sauté up a bit of mushrooms in the iron skillet I cooked the beef in, to absorb some of the beef fat along with the olive oil and darkened butter. With all of this, of course, is a cup of black coffee from my favorite Aceh province grounds via chemex. 

It's not always easy to walk away from breakfast satisfied without eating much in the way of carbohydrates, but this one is like top-notch comfort food.

(Everyone who begins to read it finds things they don't agree with, in part because its statements are mainly so definite and not esoteric or open to mysticism at all.)


Moreover, the ordinary cultural attitudes in fashion today lead consistently to misery and ruin. By reading the scriptures, I am privileged to understand what factors are at work when everyone around me tumbles predictably into the same problems.

superspeck,HomeImprovement,1389503267.0,"What did he say about the rest of the roof?

All of these items are patchwork that would take me, as a homeowner who is a relatively good roofer, about two full days of work to patch. You're looking at probably a few squares of roofing shingles, new roofing jacks, and new turbines (because nothing's more miserable than a turbine that doesn't spin or squeaks)... But if there's this much damage, then I'm curious if the roof hasn't deteriorated to the point where it's going to be cheaper to have the house re-roofed. Most of the time, the edge damage is a sign that the roof is not long for this world, and if there's water intrusion to the soffits or the fascia board it means that the underlayment has deteriorated. 

Your roof is a system -- it's the decking, the underlayment, the hardware, and the shingles. The decking supports everything. The underlayment is the actual waterproofing layer. The hardware ventilates it and provides safe paths for water around necessary holes. The shingles protect everything from the sun and impact damage. If any part of that system fails, you can patch it and limp along for a few years, but you really need to replace the roof sooner as opposed to later.

Now, it's really fun dressing *up*, in my nice button downs, nice chinos or slacks, my pretty pretty boots. I feel so gentlemanly and urban.

Not_Han_Solo,AskWomen,1389503948.0,"Okay, there have been a *lot* of answers in this thread which are either incomplete or bullshit.  The closest thing we've got to true so far is the basic feminist ""it's because of the patriarchy"" line.  The more complete answer is that it all boils down to [ancient and medieval Western inheritance laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture).

The concept traces back Biblically, and while it was not especially strong in Roman times, as the Church supplanted the old Roman Empire, a more ancient version of Biblical birthright was adopted across most of Europe.  according to Biblical birthrights, the firstborn had the rights to his father's estates, while subsequent sons were entitled to differing, but much *smaller* shares of their father's wealth.

Ah, but there's the rub, isn't it?  It's the eldest *son* of the *father* that gets all the loot; we know for a fact that a little boy is his mother's son because he came out of her.  But how did people know, in ancient times, that that little boy was his father's son?  Well, they didn't, and there was no way that anyone could possibly tell in that day.  They had to trust the word of the mother that she had only slept with the child's father during the month that she'd gotten pregnant.  Men worried a lot about this phenomenon, which is called paternity uncertainty in Anthropological circles (I'd link you, but most stuff I can get is through JSTOR, and I really don't know how many of you would be able to actually read the links.  [This](http://evoanth.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/paternity-uncertainty-infanticide-and-the-evolution-of-monogamy/) is a discussion of the same concept in monkies, though, which illustrates the principle.).

As a result of the cultural custom of male-line inheritance, the West, like many other strongly patrilineal societies, placed a high cultural value on sexual monogamy in women specifically.  When women bought into this idea, they were (at least in society's mind) less likely to sleep with men other then their husbands and, as a result, less likely to bear him a ""false"" firstborn son.  By contrast, no particular cultural value was placed on specifically male monogamy, because there was no extra reason for it.  

Now, we're basically dealing with the dregs of an ancient-medieval tradition which was closely related to inheritance patterns.  The practice survived until recent times, but was smashed--and hard--by the women's lib movement, and it is currently being actively dissolved.  You can see this because so many women today speak scornfully about the practice and because fewer and fewer men are caring.  If you want an even more pointed example of this, consider sexting, a practice which would have been *unthinkable*, even had the technology been in place, in the 1980s.  Cultural practices take time to wither and die.  This is just a guess, but these things tend to go generationally, so I'd wager that in 30 years the idea that 'women are supposed to be pure' or whatever version of the claptrap you hear about today will be considered to be thoroughly quaint, and in 60 years the concept will be downright bizarre to your typical American citizen."

The only way $800 is justifiable is if the transmission has to come out, but it doesn't on your car. Your starter is easy to get to. I've seen cars and trucks with starters buried down in the car like that.

If you can have someone replace it for $165 that's a hell of a deal. The starter itself probably costs like $100-140 retail.

Just write the story like J.R.R. Tolkien would (with no women) and then do some genderswapping.

This works really well because in the end, the idea that you can't write a good female character is just you being in your own head that there's some special trick to figuring out what a woman would do. People are people, regardless of gender, and there's a lot more uniqueness and individuality among genders than there is between them.

Willravel,AskScienceFiction,1389505105.0,"Androids can be programmed not to seek equality. 

Groups who are treated as second class citizens are never given equality out of the kindness of the hearts of the privileged, they are forced to actively seek equality, sometimes through extreme measures. People, or sentient creatures, have independence and free will which are stripped of them by societal rules and norms. 

Androids, on the other hand, are engineered from scratch, every facet of their minds are programmed software put onto hardware. They are not born with independence and free will, in fact those things are generally left out intentionally. 

That said, this does raise questions about who/what is or isn't deserving of equal treatment. Are droids unworthy of equality because they're not programmed to seek it? Is that the only metric? Or are they worthy of equality, but are unlikely to ever gain it because they are unable to recognize that injustice? When C-3PO and R2-D2 are chased out of Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in Mos Eisley, C-3PO simply complies.

YoungFolks,asktransgender,1389505193.0,"Feelings, including dysphoria, aren't a constant. Some days they're stronger than others. Somedays they're there, some days not. Think of it this way: you really like pancakes. Somedays you really really want a pancake. Another day, you'd be happy with a pancake, but you wouldn't mind a waffle either. Other days, you still like pancakes, but you really really want french toast. All these times, you still like pancakes, but how much you need them at the moment changes. Same with any other feelings and wants.

&gt;How did you know, or better yet, how did you decide to take the plunge?

I'm pre all medical and legal stuff, but I know I want T and top surgery. A friend I talked to when I was having doubts gave me good advice: live as full time as I can without doing anything permanent. Tell people to call my by my chosen name and use ""he"". Get a binder and a packer and work on my voice. Do this for a while, and see how I feel. I did, and it felt pretty good, in a ""this is how I'm supposed to be"" sort of way. That's how I know. Now I just need to get the money/insurance/doctor stuff taken care of to get my perscription. 

&gt;How long do I have to ""turn back"", I know HRT is permanent eventually, but can there be a point where I can pull the plug if its not for me, or is that not possible at all?

I'm not really qualified to answer this. I don't know much about the effects of HRT for transwomen. 

&gt;How concerned should I be about passing? I mean, if I decide this is what I want, I don't think I could stand it if no one else saw me the way I feel on the inside.

From what I've heard from people who've transitioned a long time ago, passing is really important when you start out. It gives you a sense of validation and confidence. After a while though, validation from the outside isn't as important as knowing on the inside. I'm just starting out and I know passing is important to me, but I also know it's hard because of reasons. I'm happy with what I can get, and work hard to improve what I can, and I know hormones will help a lot. 

If you're still nervous because you think there's no way you'll ever pass, remember that we are our harshest critics. We have a hard time seeing what others do, and often a hard time seeing past our flaws. Other people may see you as Abby lomg before you see it yourself. And, HRT can have a huge impact. Looking at /r/transtimelines and /r/transpassing may be helpful. To see just how drastic the changes can be. "

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1389506005.0,"&gt;  In reality main source of vast majority of government program funding is tax on workers pay (82% of current government revenue comes from payroll tax and individual income tax).

Not a requirement. Business taxes, consumption taxes, financial transaction taxes, QE in the form of direct payments, etc., etc. 

&gt; Basic Income presents reduction in additional welfare and social programs as one of its benefits. But there is nothing to guarantee that payments will be used responsibly. What happens if people use all of their income payments irresponsibly (drugs, alcohol, gambling, video games, etc). Do we let them starve?

You mean the same situation we have right now and have always had? It's not as if this is some new problem we'd be introducing into the world. The problem already exists and I see little evidence to suggest it would exacerbate the issue. Universal healthcare covers the treatment of most of those life choices, something I'd like to see as a component of UBI and a shift in the so called criminal justice system.

&gt; Since vast majority of people's well-being is directly tied to the health of the government and the GDP, what happens if there is a major catastrophe (i.e. war, disease outbreak etc.)?

You mean the same problem that we already have with capitalism, but with mechanisms of distributed sovereign debt available? We're already in a pit of problem with concentrated capital and dependence upon private market performance. We are dependent already.

&gt;What happens to immigration? Wouldn't the shortage of workers in workforce due to citizens getting basic income encourage companies to hire illegal immigrants?

What shortage? We have and are likely to continue to have a surplus of labor for the foreseeable future of humanity.

&gt; How do you stop government abuse when basic income would give the government unprecedented control since majority would be entirely dependent on government payments?

UBI reduces the level of control by making simple transfer payments. Complete dependency on the government is a strawman of what UBI is. Government is dependent on the people. The people are dependent upon each other. Government ensures minimium guarantees on the distribution of the productive output of the people.

&gt; I'm assuming we would still be a democracy so whats to stop something like 50% reduction in monthly income for those that are gay or no payments for those that don't go to church law from being passed if the majority votes for it.

Oh I dunno, the same sorts of things that have pushed back on this sort of shit forever? Progressive culture. I take it from what you've written you're hyper paranoid of the 'tyranny of the majority'?"

howoriginal4532,Frat,1389506313.0,"A similar situation happened in my Chapter between two of the gay brothers. They were never caught doing anything but a lot of the more homophobic brothers suspected that they were hooking up so they brought it up to the whole Chapter instead of confronting them face-to-face. Whatever you do, do NOT bring this up during Chapter meetings unexpectedly. I'm gay as well and it pretty much launched an investigation where I was questioned about my sex life in front of my entire Chapter when I had done absolutely nothing wrong. It was humiliating and was definitely the low part of my experience.

Sorry I can't really offer any helpful advice. My opinion, though as a gay man (so take this with a grain of salt), is to just let it be. Forbidding them from seeing each other doesn't really make much sense, IMO, since they're brothers and will be seeing each other regardless. Just confront them individually and tell them you feel uncomfortable about them doing stuff in your room and to take it elsewhere."

Yes, I can come up with worst-case scenarios too. Maybe I'll get in an accident and my boyfriend will leave me because I'm now in a wheelchair and he can't handle it, and it turns out he was cheating on me with a woman who is now pregnant and I'm forced to raise the baby as they run away. Or something.

You still give no basis for any of this. I am forced to believe you either don't want to reveal it for some reason, or it's all in your head and you're really, really insecure. Either way I don't think we're making any progress here.

I truly was hoping I could help. Even back when I posted in the first thread, my hope was that it would go like this:

Me: You know, just because she wants him to be her primary doesn't mean she wants you to become her secondary. You can have more than one primary.

You: You can? Oh, good, I thought I was less important to her than before.

Me: Obviously not, or she wouldn't have wanted you to stay.

You: That's a relief.

A talk ensues, you realise she loves you as much as ever, possibly even more (that's how I work so it's possible), you realise you can get along with the guy, you become good friends, your relationships all last for decades.

But whatever I say, I'm waiting for you to either say ""no, no, she said she could only have one primary at a time/ she said she was demoting me / she said she wants her relationship to be less important than hers"" or acknowledge that if she didn't, then you were projecting.

But all I get is you telling me I don't understand what you're talking about, and explaining how if everything went wrong, then everything would be going wrong.

So I can't help you, sorry. I hope everything gets better but I'm obviously only making you feel worse."

The funerals happened whether you like it or not. Have you heard of the stages of grief? 1. Denial 2. Anger 3. Bargaining 4. Depression 5. Acceptance. The parents upon hearing the news most likely cried until they had no more tears left. When giving the interviews days/weeks after they were probably still in disbelief/denial of what happened. Are they supposed to cry non-stop 24/7? You act like they were just told their kids were killed and reporters stuck mics and cameras in their faces. You have hundreds of emergency personnel reporting seeing the same thing. You have dozens of emergency personnel who can't work anymore because seeing dozens of bodies, mostly children, fucked them in the head. So out of the thousands of people affiliated with this, they are all actors or were told to hush? Get the fuck out of here. If your version was hypothetically true, I guarantee you someone would spill the beans. Someone would post a YouTube video, prove their affiliation, and tell everyone. Unless you think YouTube is owned by some Illuminati devil worshipers. Then more people would come out. There is a certain feeling that most people can't live with and that's guilt. Your theory implies that there are thousands of actors who are in on it, took funeral photos together, took photos outside the Elementary school together, and no regular Joe would've been there to compromise their act. The police, paramedics, fake parents, fake friends, fake relatives, fake news crew, governor, coroner, district attorney, and fake investigators were all in on it. Get fucking real."

*  Chapters may not allow anyone visibly under the influence of alcohol to enter their event, even if they are 21 and of legal drinking age. 

*  On the condition the UPD and SLO PD jurisdiction is changed, whereas UPD are the
responders to off campus registered events, the Dean of Students can work with UPD to
determine the proper number of officers needed for each night based on the number of
registered social events. Should the number of necessary officers exceed the normal
staffing, the costs to hire an additional officer for the evening of the party shall be split
evenly between all sponsoring chapters. Chapters must provide the funds to UPD by 12
noon the day before the event or the event shall be canceled.

* No kegs or hard alcohol.

* No shots, drinking games, or other activities that encourage inappropriate
drinking behaviors.

So frats have to arrange every single driver?

* If the event is away from campus and requires transportation, the chapter is responsible
for the coordination and payment of transportation.

**Guest List**

* A. Guest lists must be 100% complete at the time of submission, turned in 24 hour prior to
the event.

* B. A follow up guest list must be submitted by Monday at 12 noon with the full names and
birthdates of all guests.

**Green Team**

(They have to physically go to every event and verify that all rules are being followed and can unilaterally decide to cancel it?)

* The Green Team will ensure that all terms of the event approval have been met by the
sponsoring organization. This team has the authority to cancel a registered social event
before it starts on the condition that the events shortcomings cannot be reconciled before
the party starts.
* i.  Exception: Events that are out of San Luis Obispo County will not be required to
have the Green Team travel to the event. However, all other terms needed to
ensure that the event is registered and meets the Party Registration guidelines are
required.

**What I would do if I got the promotion:** I would lead the 11th division true to the standards I was taught when I was in the Shin'o Academy. Lead as a true combat squad, with dedication, and passion. Teaching the my subordinates what it means to be an honorable, and dutiful shinigami warrior."

Arcturus_,AskMen,1389507494.0,"Alright this isn't exactly what you're asking OP, but it's close. 

When I was in grade 9 there was a girl who I liked who happened to like me as well. We'd always tease each other and stuff, but also have nice conversations as well. Sometimes when I was at my locker talking with friends she'd come up and bump me with her hip in a playful manner. It was cute and all so I decided I'd do it back once in a while. Let me pre face this by saying I'm a big guy. I played fullback for 5 years. I thought I was being all fun and nice and shit but in reality I would check this girl into her locker and hurt her pretty bad, all while not realizing it. She wasn't a small delicate flower or anything, but I definitely underestimated how hard I must have been hitting her. I thought it was all playful fun. Her friend comes up to me one day and says I need to back off and stop full on checking her into her locker cause it hurts the fuck out of her and pretty much we stopped talking from there. I think she started thinking I was some creep who got off on hurting her when I didn't even realize I was.

Avistew,polyamory,1389507521.0,"Mmh, what is the context? Did he kiss her out of the blue? Have they been dating? Did you discuss this kind of things beforehand?

I don't have his side so obviously I don't know for sure, but you say he doesn't want you to hang out with his friends if she's also around, and I have to ask... Why? Did he tell you? Because that doesn't sound good. There shouldn't be any problem with both of you hanging out at the same time.

On top of that, if he actually phrased it that way (""I don't want you around when she's around"") rather than saying ""I don't want both of you around at the same time"", it sounds like she gets first pick, and then you get to hang out if she doesn't choose to. Which, if true, would be fucked up. That king of things should be decided all together.

Are you currently in the same city as he is? If so, why do you have no support, does he not support you? If you aren't, was he going to be part of the trip, too?

I honestly need more context for the kiss itself, as the situation is different if they'd been dating, or he mentioned her as an interest, vs if he showed up one day and said ""Oh, hey, by the way, I kissed Irene. She's my girlfriend now"".

What kind of arrangement do you have? Is it fine to just kiss people before talking about it with each other, or not? Or did you not discuss it before?

He's definitely allowed to change his mind about someone. It's possible he realised he was wrong about her. However, your reaction made sense too. So he shouldn't act like you're crazy to wonder why he's kissing someone he only ever had negative comments on. If he intentionally made you feel that way (through his done of voice or calling you that), then he's wrong to have done so. However, it's also possible you felt that way without him influencing you. Hard to know without being there.

I would say, talk to him more. Talk to her, as well. If she's your metamour, you should be able to talk. If she doesn't want you to talk to her... Big red flag. I would be too worried that he hasn't even told her he's with you, or something.

Lastly, and it's not really a fix for your situation, but if you get along with his friends, contact them to hang out. He doesn't need to be there when you hang out with people who are now your friends as well, and you don't need his permission. 

Really, at first when I started reading, I thought maybe there was a kiss and you panicked because it's a new step, but that you had nothing to worry about. But as I kept reading... He kissed someone he's not actually dating? He doesn't want you to hang out with his friends when she's there? That's just weird. It seems fishy.

I really don't know what you can do about talk more about it, but, yeah, as far as I can tell, you are not crazy. But I don't think it's hopeless either. He might be defensive because he had a wrong opinion of her and doesn't want to admit he was wrong. He might not want to be with both of you at once because he worries you'll get jealous, or doubts his abilities to be there for both of you at once.

So definitely check with him, and if it stays fishy... probably run away. How long have you guys been together?"

I'm thinking of the Malazan Book of the Fallen, where magic exists as the influence of tangential dimensions called warrens. The warrens themselves tend to spit you out odd places and have internal conditions the characters know nothing about. He repeatedly abuses the chaotic nature of the warrens to confound characters - more than once, problems with magic decide the death of major characters.

There's more to it, of course, as he plays with themes of destiny versus free will versus pure chance, and different notions of death. But I think you can abuse magic's unpredictable nature to create additional conflict."

ajslater,todayilearned,1389507845.0,"Current thinking is that IQ and other general intelligence (G) measures are predictive of some success at tasks within two standard deviations.

That is to say, if your IQ is above 140, that really doesn't mean much, because past that point being more 'generally' intelligent is eclipsed by being really good at specific tasks. Feynman being not so good at history or perhaps language related tasks because he didn't study them and pursued his stronger abilities in math.

IQ tests were originally developed with numerical scores, the point of the test was a pass/fail for indicating that mental retardation might be present, not exceptional ability or general intelligence. They have since been adapted to try to be more a measure of general intelligence. Contrary to your statement the most recent psychological findings support that they do retain a bit of crude utility in that regard. You can predict economic success on average by seeing if someone scores a standard deviation or two above or below the mean.

If you've ever taken one, you'll realize that they test very specific skills and that a single numerical score is more than a little crude for trying to represent any mental ability, never mind encapsulating all of someones 'intelligence'.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1389508119.0,"Maybe the problem isn't ""black women"". Maybe the problem is the ridiculous expectations they feel as far as their appearance and demeanor. It sounds to me like a lot of these women you've met are tired of being expected to look a certain way, and this is their way of thumbing their nose at it. A lot of white women feel the same way - the expectation that you have to have your hair a certain way, and wear some clothes but not others, and be a particular weight/build, get to be altogether too much. The problem isn't that they aren't feminine. Maybe the problem is that they feel like there's no freedom to look and act like they want.

Of course, I say that as a white woman, so I could be totally wrong. But I do know that there's pressure on us, too, to look a certain way, and if you don't measure up it's easy to wind up feeling frustrated and inadequate and, eventually, to just stop trying."

It's in the coming days, weeks, and months that the subject can slowly examine and organize this new information into valuable insight. On the other hand, psycholytic (low dose) sessions are much more grounded in the sense that the subject isn't being overwhelmed with an immense amount of information and can actively draw conclusions during the session. But yes, psychedelic sessions are completely unpredictable, thus, they are hit or miss. Psycholytic sessions are more controlled, predictable and able to be conducted in a scientific manner, but progress is much slower. But you are absolutely right.

But by the third act, the story starts moving at a much faster pace, and by Act 4, the story is 100% created by the author and it reaches its full stride.

The majority of the panels of the comic are simple animated GIFs. On occassion, there are animated flashes complete with music. Usually these advance the story quite a bit and get a lot done, but a few are for laughs and giggles."

Avistew,sex,1389508387.0,"It's a bit hard to be sure without knowing the kind of pain and its intensity, but the two things that come to mind are size issue and vaginismus.

Size difference is the most likely culprit. People are all different, and although we wish we could ""fit"" with the people in our lives, it's not always that simple. If he's too big or you're too tight, the solution is to have more foreplay and use more lube.

Some women don't really want to use lube because they feel it makes them a failure as a woman because they couldn't produce it on their own. But sometimes you're aroused and you won't get wet. Even if you get wet, it won't last forever. And even if you get wet, well there are limits to what your natural wetness can do.

In the past, women whose partners were too well-endowed for them may have had to suffer, but we don't have to anymore. Lube is your friend. Definitely give it a try if you haven't yet.

And if you anticipate pain, you'll probably clench and it will hurt more. So do your best to relax. Have some non-penetrative sex first (masturbation, oral sex...) to make sure you're well relaxed and ready.

If none of that helps and the pain is really bad, quickly read up on vaginismus and see if that could be the reason. But in most cases, the problems are solve through more foreplay and more lube.

Good luck!"

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1389508689.0,"&gt;  I'm actually trying to take seriously the idea that the reason the sun goes by overhead in such and so a pattern is that the Sun God makes it do so, the mountains are here and there is because of some epic formative event, not tectonic dynamics, etc. Life and death, the seasons and the weather - all of these things are driven by magical causality, with the gods and demons in positions of determinative power.

Right, so, what I'm seeing is these gods have *jobs.* I mean, obviously the sun god can do his job however he likes, and even shirk if it he likes. But can he quit? Can he go become another god? What happens if he leaves or dies?

This is true of ancient mythologies which resemble this premise: the world predates the gods and they are stuck doing their jobs to keep everything from going to shit. The reasons for this vary.

So, effectively, you need to keep the gods from just destroying and remaking things at random. You need to encourage them not to ruin everything for shits and giggles. You also need contingencies for when positions become vacated."

Avistew,polyamory,1389509118.0,"&gt;It seems that women usually have greater ease in finding new partners, is this true and if so does this create a gender benefit in poly?

Let's assume it's true. I'm not sure it is because it hasn't been my experience, but it seems to be many people. But if it is true, are all the partners they find women as well? I'm going to assume not. There must be some men in there.

Are over half the new partners women? I wouldn't think so. It would seem unlikely, as heterosexuality is still the majority.

Let's say 50% of the new partner are men, and 50% are women. I would think more than that would be men, but we can adapt the numbers to whatever stats we find. Still, if it's 50-50... well, the new partners are entering poly relationships. Therefore, they count, too. So if prior to the new partners the genders were balanced, after the search they should be, at well.

Of course, it's more complicated than that. Anyone who was already in a polyamorous relationship before becoming the ""new partner"" we're talking about... should we count them twice?

What are we counting here? The gender of people involved in poly relationships, or the typical number of partners?

Because if you take, say, a MFF triad and use them and only them for statistics... Well you could say ""there are two women for every man. Men are at an advantage for finding partners"" or you could say ""men and women all had two partners, both genders are the same"" or you could say ""men are only 50% as likely to be someone's partner, compared to women.""

So it's always tricky to get definite answers from statistics. There are just too many ways to spin them."

Who's going to stick around after the first night when your brother tries his best to be obnoxious and drive the interloper away?

Also, under no circumstances should you agree to house him without a definitive diagnosis from an expert YOU pick. I'm suspicious there is something they know and are hiding from you. Plus if you pick the expert, you can get an opinion as to how doable this will be for you.

I suspect they are worried about what will become of him after they have gone. You are the obvious person to transfer the obligation to, except for the little detail that you shouldn't have to give up your life for him. 


Tell your parents that it is highly unlikely you will want to have anything to do with him in the long term if he ruins your life now, so if they really want to be sure he is cared for, they have to come up with something that works for you, really works, not just doable with sufficient bribe."

Art is an opportunity for someone to reflect *their* perspective on a picture by changing it, or show their own style by bending things to fit their style. There are people who draw big noses (like in a Disney-esque style) and some who don't even draw them at all. And, unsurprisingly, if you asked either of those people to draw a real person in their style, they will twist it to their own style.

Even within their own style though, there probably is a big and a small.

As an example, [this](http://i.imgur.com/HXpxO.jpg) is Friedrich the Great in Hetalia. He was made ""cuter"" by turning him into an anime character - he was put in a new style. He's still clearly older than the other characters, has the same wig, etc etc. and is identifiable."

In a perfect world this is what I'd like..

I'd like to see a game set in the year 2147. We're on Mars playing as the team that discovers the first trace of Element Zero on Mars. Maybe we do a mission focused on the team that unearths the Prothean data cache on Mars. Cutscenes come up showing scientists all around the world trying to decipher this new language. It shows the struggles humanity is having with religion due to this... It's the prologue and it introduces us into this world, this universe of endless possibility. A short mission, maybe 15-25 minutes in length occurs and it ends with the words Mass Effect on the screen. 

Fast forward to 2149. We're shown cutscenes of humans on Earth doing every day things.. They've more advanced now than they were in 2014, flashes of their new and improved tech is shown. Their clothes are different, everything is familiar yet changed. Suddenly talking fades in, all while the scenes of humanity continue to play on. We're suddenly coming in on the scene that reveals some of these data caches have been cracked. Charon, Plutos Moon is actually a frozen mass relay..The excitement, the fear, the possibilities this holds are endless.

Cue in Jon Grissom, our protagonist. He's a hero amongst the Alliance, a man of true strength. This is who we'll be playing as for the rest of the game. We're given a basic rundown of things and eventually sent on the mission. We're about to jump through a relay for the first time, who knows what's going to happen, what's on the other side suspense is building. Suddenly we've jumped 36 light years away in a flash. 

The game more less focuses a little bit on the first contact war. It gives us fresh perspective on the Protheans, it focuses on human colonization into the galaxy. It shows us what life in this time is like in a very indepth way. The raiders, the alien species, the wonders of this whole new universe we've unlocked thanks to the Protheans. We as gamers get to discover alongside humanity what all of this means instead of being Shepard who was already 20+ years past the initial discoveries. We're truly living in this world and immersed in it like never before. We're able to explore systems, land on planets and explore. 

This is just a small part, a very small part of what could be. The team at Bioware can do almost anything and make it a master piece. I think they need to make us fall in love all over again, get the lightning in that bottle for the second time. I have faith in them, despite the ending catastrophe. "

&gt;To Disarm The System
The Vehicle Security Alarm can be disarmed using any of
the following methods:
• Press the UNLOCK button on the Remote Keyless
Entry (RKE) transmitter.
• Grasp the Passive Entry Unlock Door Handle with a
valid Key Fob available in the same exterior zone (if
equipped), refer to Keyless Enter-N-Go™  in Things
To Know Before Starting You Vehicle

• Cycle the vehicle ignition system out of the OFF
position.
• For vehicles equipped with Keyless Enter-N-Go™ ,
press the Keyless Enter-N-Go™ Start/Stop button
(requires at least one valid Key Fob in the vehicle).
• For vehicles not equipped with Keyless Enter-N-Go™
, insert a valid key into the ignition switch and turn the
key to the ON position.
NOTE:
• The driver’s door key cylinder and the liftgate button
on the RKE transmitter cannot arm or disarm the
Vehicle Security Alarm.
• The Vehicle Security Alarm remains armed during
power liftgate entry. Pressing the liftgate button will
not disarm the Vehicle Security Alarm. If someone
enters the vehicle through the liftgate and opens any
door the alarm will sound.
• When the Vehicle Security Alarm is armed, the interior
power door lock switches will not unlock the doors.
The Vehicle Security Alarm is designed to protect your
vehicle; however, you can create conditions where the
system will give you a false alarm. If one of the previously
described arming sequences has occurred, the
Vehicle Security Alarm will arm regardless of whether
you are in the vehicle or not. If you remain in the vehicle
and open a door, the alarm will sound. If this occurs,
disarm the Vehicle Security Alarm.
If the Vehicle Security Alarm is armed and the battery
becomes disconnected, the Vehicle Security Alarm will
remain armed when the battery is reconnected; the
exterior lights will flash, the horn will sound. If this
occurs, disarm the Vehicle Security Alarm.

i.e. there's no real predictive difference between an IQ score of 140 or 160. Its like the difference between 60 and 40. The former scores mean you're probably generally smart enough, and any real differences will be shown by intense specialization in a subject area. The latter scores mean you might be in need of some help. Specifically what kind of help should be determined by more specialized tests.

But on average, people with an IQ of 130 are going to do better in more difficult graduate studies and professional careers than people who score 80.

Low scores were the original purpose of Binet's test. IQ tests started life as a pass/fail test for ""should we run other tests to assess for mental retardation?"". If less than 70, then investigate further. They've since been used as a test for smartypantsness, and have shown some some crude utility there. (Or your IQ score of 160 mostly means you're good at IQ tests)

tl;dr; Summing up someone's brain meats in a single dimension is silly on its face and you shouldn't take it too seriously, but it can actually be used as a crude tool for some things."

Okay, I have lots of issues with your assertion here, but just to get one out of the way--when you're poor, really, truly, poor, there is no cash under the mattress.

Here is where I'm coming from with this advice: 

I'm turning 28 this year. I have had... six relationships with people I've met online. (And precisely three relationships with people I've met in person and several flings, and do understand that this has been over the last 11 years) I've met five of them, and all but one of these were international relationships. 

For some of these relationships, I've been able to afford a webcam, and frankly, while I understand the computer will overheat, surely you could push it for 15 or 20 minutes, if the processors available in 2003 were able to support webcam for an hour.

And, for another thing... Your relationship will be *incredibly* difficult to maintain without regularly seeing each other's face. It just will. A webcam and decent enough computer are actually pretty important investments into the relationship. Of course, if you can handle it, kudos... Just, in my experience, it doesn't work, causes major issues, and ultimately has been *the* leading reason that three of those online relationships haven't worked out for me. 

But good luck with that. Really. "

So many black women lack the basics of posture, poise and aplomb. It really takes the wind out of my sails. I don't try that hard to be good looking, but I do try and it does show sometimes.

Of course I say that but... I would feel terrible too. Hence the hugs *hugs*.

Take a deep breath, and remember, it's nothing against you. It doesn't mean anything about who you are as a person. She's against polyamory, she has wrong ideas about it, she thinks it's bad for her son and she loves him.

Starwhisperer,AskReddit,1389515051.0,"You know, that's what I'm afraid of. I'm in my last semester of college right now. And while there are many aspects of my University that I dislike and things that annoy me about my current friends, all I need is that moment of shared uncontrollable laughter with them and that's when I know that I'm living life and life is good.  
  
While, I did not have it as good as you, I was grateful to have scholarships to help pay my way through school. And my mom worked her butt off to help take me and my siblings through college, so money was never that much of a concern for me. My definition of success is relationships, laughter, love, and security and if I had to include money, it would be just enough money that will let me live comfortably.  
  
But, I don't know. While, I do not want to stay in college forever, the prospects after college seem rather daunting and doesn't seem to live up to the days of school years - 1st-College (although unbearable as doing hw and being controlled by adults may seem) I truly enjoyed those years and the friends that were made and the moments had.  
  
And the OP did seem really judgmental with that statement. Not everyone finds enjoyment through money and not everybody's success is determined through those lens. And, in fact, anybody no matter what age, has the ability to change their life for the better. I would not like to live in your world."

A moderate level of alcohol does not make me feel the same as it does most people, and beginning to sober up after just a couple/few feels different as well. I am different, and emulating others' behavior does not have the same result.

Nearly all of us have struggled with and failed to moderate consistently (your current level of success is not uncommon however). Any claim of success in moderation is tenuous after only a few weeks of it. The danger is that somebody else early in sobriety, who is typical in that moderation will fail for them, will see your post and decide to give it another go.

AdamDe27,JusticePorn,1389516922.0,"I'm pasting from the paragraph about California because its the top of the list.

&gt; Assessment of Costs by Judge Arthur Alarcon and Prof. Paula Mitchell (2011, updated 2012)

&gt;The authors concluded that the cost of the death penalty in California has totaled over $4 billion since 1978:

&gt;$1.94 billion--Pre-Trial and Trial Costs


&gt;$925 million--Automatic Appeals and State Habeas Corpus Petitions

&gt;$775 million--Federal Habeas Corpus Appeals

&gt;$1 billion--Costs of Incarceration


&gt;The authors calculated that, if the Governor commuted the sentences of those remaining on death row to life without parole, it would result in an immediate savings of $170 million per year, with a savings of $5 billion over the next 20 years. 

&gt;According to statistics provided by the office of California's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst, the current annual cost for maintaining an inmate in a state prison is $47,102. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, however, places the number at $44,563.
But the alternative-the death penalty-may cost taxpayers even more. Published reports by both the Northern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and USA Today say it costs an additional $90,000 a year, including the cost of appeals, to house prisoners on death row than in the general inmate population.

I wore pads for way, way too long. My periods were miserable. Then I switched to tampons in my mid teens and it was like spotlights and confetti and enlightenment. It made my period suck 10x less.

Switching from tampons to cups was just as life changing.

They're reusable, great for the environment and your wallet. They're so much more hygienic than pads or tampons, because they simply collect menstrual fluid instead sucking it into a wad of absorbent material that becomes a cesspool of bacteria and oxidation and terrible smells. They're so, so comfortable when they fit and are inserted properly. I never have to worry about leaks unless I'm having a hellacious period, because they hold lots more than tampons and actually contain it with a barrier between the blood and the outside of your vagina.

And best of all, I can essentially forget I'm on my period because I only have to empty and clean them twice a day, after I wake up and before I go to bed.

Honestly, I wish you were right.  Anyone who could fool the whole world would be a smart man, smart enough to actually deal with some of our issues in a competent way.  Someone who could solve some long and tough issues, like say education or energy.  The funny thing is, anyone who could pull it off wouldn't need a conspiracy to get elected, they could just run.

No, the reality is much uglier.  The truth is, we have a big, complex, chaotic system with literally millions of players that is our government.  And like most public sector employees, the vast majority of these people are not ambitious or skilled enough to fool *the entire world*.  If they were, you can bet your ass they wouldn't be in the public sector, when they could make so much more in private.

It can be nice to think there is some sort of rhyme and reason to it all, as dark as it may seem.  Well, in truth, its just a huge fucking mess."

I'll agree with the statement that 'people who must face the prospect of slaughtering an animal are more respectful of the value of animal life' Killing is unpleasant, I've done it, I don't like it, but given the choice of killing a chicken or never eating chicken, I'm fairly confident a large number of people, given proper instruction and preparation, would easily be able to do so."

&gt;Liver flukes are a parasite that may be found in the liver of some deer. Adult flukes are flat, oval-shaped, purple-gray in color and look like leeches or ""bloodsuckers."" The flukes vary in size from 15-30 millimeters (mm) wide, by 30-100mm long, by 2-5mm thick. Even though the flukes may cause local damage to the liver, it is rare that the presence of liver flukes significantly affects the health of the deer. Consumption of venison from an infected deer poses no risk to humans.

I'm opposed to removing horns for the sake of discouraging poachers, which is practiced in some regions. I think the better solution is re-educating the people who consume the horn. Yao Ming, for instance, has come out against it, and is trying to spread the word of how harmful it is in China and how it's actually a placebo. Dry up the market, and poaching will stop.

Mostly I just like blathering about conservation techniques. Not disagreeing, but talking more about how to solve the situation. (And I always thought fingernails/compacted hair is a poor analogy.

The word Patriarchy is a scientific term used by social scientists to describe the structure of societies. The problem for some is that it feels like an attack on a given person's 'status quo' -""i feel that society is good for me"" (one might say as a white male) but the problem is that society isn't equal, people don't have equal opportunities, addressing the problem is to question and criticize the structure of society

UlgraTheTerrible,bipolar,1389523858.0,"Right, well, I've told this story on here before but I've got stuff to do today so I can't dig through my post history to find it, so here is the abbreviated version: 

Bipolar lady I knew before my own diagnosis was a right mess, kid taken away, flashing people out the window, constantly looking for a new place to live because she was incapable of caring for herself, family tearing out their hair, etc. 

She disappeared for a while.

Saw her a year or two after I'd kinda observed her from afar and barely recognized her, she looked amazing, put together, makeup done, and the danger gleam (we all know the gleam) was gone from her eyes. 

Turns out, she'd gone and landed herself back in hospital when she disappeared, but they *finally* figured out that she had been misdiagnosed with bipolar and was actually schizophrenic. 

So once they had that sorted and started treating for the *proper* illness, her quality of life improved immensely. 

I'm not saying schizophrenia is a walk in the park to have by any means, but I am saying that if you *happen* to have it, it would probably be best that you treat it, rather than living in denial or fear, because that will almost certainly result in worse quality of life than acknowledging what could be wrong. 

Also, psychotic features can happen with bipolar as well. At my most manic, I've had angels and demons (yes, I could see and hear them) arguing over my soul. I also get complex migraines fairly regularly. And the TCM's you're describing sound like absence seizures, which can also be comorbid with bipolar somewhat frequently. 

Fact is, the medication I'm on was originally slated to treat epilepsy. It works also for bipolar, and is sometimes prescribed off-label for migraine relief. I don't have the background to explain *exactly* why, but suffice to say that bipolar, epilepsy, and migraines can all be caused by some of the same things going wrong in the brain, but in different areas. 

*However* not *all* people with bipolar will have seizures and/or migraines, and vice versa, because bipolar is kind of an aggregate term that groups together similar symptoms. But these symptoms can and do have multiple causes, and it is almost impossible to tell what's going on with current medical technology. It's why a med that is awesome for one person *hardly* works universally for everyone.

I'd also suggest talking to your doctor about how much the weight gain has upset you, to see if trying some different meds might help... But even if you do get your meds switched and start to feel better and stop gaining... You aren't going to lose unless you're burning more calories than you're taking in. And that's the truth, and the worst part is that the medication can suppress those chemicals that tell us when we're full. 

Right now, I'm sitting around 100 kg (that's 220 lbs for those curious, and I'm 5'7). And it is *hard* for me to not get *fatter*. I don't exercise nearly as much as I should, and I eat way too much.

doc_birdman,AdviceAnimals,1389524795.0,"""Retail Sales Associate"" here, aka, I'm a cashier at a college bookstore. Since some of my students and their parents pay anywhere from $500 - $1,000 a semester on books, I've had customers from all points on the spectrum. The parents that come in a huge huff stomping their feet and complaint to me while asking questions basically asking *me* why one textbook costs $300 (like *I* set the price) usually get what they want because well... That's kind of my job. I don't care if you're an asshole unless you step out of line honestly. And about the passive and soft-spoken people... They generally just don't complain very much. They may be upset but they usually understand that the reason they are upset is unavoidable or they understand that yes, these books are very expensive on top of their already ridiculously expensive tuition, but bitching to the sales clerk isn't going to help it. So I just give everyone tips on how to save money at our store. 

TL;DR I think ""loud"" people get what they want because they voice their opinions much more than others and get upset more easily. The passive people understand some of these issues aren't that big of a deal and accept them. "

sunglasses619,EatingDisorders,1389531154.0,"Hi -- the fact that you are asking is in itself possibly indicative of some discomfort surrounding food and eating. It signifies at least that you are considering that you might be practicing disordered eating, and that's good, but at the same time signals that you might be aware that your habits are more than just preference or habit. 

If others around you are expressing concern, try and sit down with them and discuss it honestly. What are they seeing that is causing them to ask you these questions? Eating disorders are extremely confusing, but this might help you see what other people are seeing -- especially if they are mentioning the same things to you.

It was just a list of ""cannot eat"". 

Did I know a peanut was a legume and not a nut ... Gosh I mean ... Maybe? It was mentioned in an elementary school science class as a fun fact and something I half remember but not something that stuck. 

But not knowing the proper classification doesn't make me any less allergic. I also have an inner ear disorder I have to google the name of to spell it correctly, but just cause I can't spell it doesn't mean I don't have it. 

To you, saying peanuts might have made more sense. But I'm also allergic to almonds, walnuts, tree nuts and macadamia nuts, and when I say ""I'm allergic to nuts"" it stops them from handing me brownies made with peanut butter AND brownies made with walnuts.

You see, normally you 'solve' whatever issue that's causing your girlfriend / wife's pain, but now it's not something you can solve. All you can do is basically hold her hand.

The biggest support during the entire process wasn't from me, her boyfriend (I'm Dutch, it's not at all uncommon not to be married here), but from the midwifes here: they were all very calm and very experienced, and that calmness had much more effect on my girlfriend than my (faked, I wasn't calm at all) calmness.

So yes, I definitely watched the whole process and it was amazing. I mean, it's pretty bloody and stuff and some part of your brain goes  ""That's NOT supposed to fit through there!"" but it's a real miracle I think, a very emotional one at that, and I'm grateful to have been able to be there.

killroy1971,AskMen,1389533736.0,"No.  It all boils down to behavior, attitude, class, and how you hold yourself.  There are negative stereotypes associated with all races.  Hollywood unknowingly promotes and maintains these stereotypes.  Some may acknowledge it, but they aren't going to stop either.  Look at the middle class white father -- he's usually a giant idiot.  Weak, clueless, and child-like.  He's too busy trying to be his kids' buddy.  The poor, exhausted white mother is the hero.  She has to be everyone's mother.  Make all important decisions.  Keep everyone in line -including her husband.  Look at Phil Dunphy character on Modern Family.  Dumb as dirt.  The date that didn't end.  I wouldn't trust him with matches, much less children.  
Are all white fathers like that?  Of course not.  However the ""all men are boys"" mantra is incredibly popular in American culture and lots of women marry over aged teenagers.  Lots of American men marry women who also perpetuate negative female stereotypes.
So the question for you shouldn't be ""are black girls less desirable?""  It should be: ""do I portray myself as the kind of woman that is attracts good, manly, men?""  Society is always messed up and entertainers only reflect our lowest and most common aspects.  Worry more about you and who you hang out with.

Estre,Svenska,1389533766.0,"About a year ago I realized that part of the reason I was progressing so slowly in my Swedish learning was that I rarely got any practice. So I decided to start a group on skype with Swedes and fellow learners as a way to get some reading and writing practice, and maybe listening/speaking (that doesn't happen much). Advertised it a bit here and at /r/sweden, and got a bunch of requests. It's still active on a daily basis, it's pretty nice because we've become friends and the Swedes are really very helpful with explanations, corrections, encouragement... I'm the ""administrator/moderator"" so to speak, I add people to my friends so that I can add them into the group. 

I feel that my level has really improved thanks to it and that my Swedish skills are pretty natural because I pretty much stopped using textbooks and just went ahead and decided to use the language. I still drill myself on vocabulary but otherwise just use TV, movies, books and skype to learn. Not a good idea for the absolute beginner perhaps (ditching the textbooks altogether, I mean), but something to work towards, definitely.

If you (or anyone else reading this, of course) would like to join, feel free to PM with your skype username."

killroy1971,AskMen,1389534750.0,"You're 19.  Don't worry about chasing women.  Focus on becoming a great man.  The women will come after you.  If you're happy with who you are, good at what you do, have a good heart and you are a good friend, it will project confidence and women will respond.  Never forget: women talk.  For every women who rejects you or is unavailable, she has three g/fs who would love to be approached.  For every woman who turns into a friend, she just green lighted three girl friends to approach you.  This means not being a jerk.  I know it works for some guys but it's false confidence.  An emotional Dutch Courage.  
Few women are confident enough to ask you out.  What scares them most?  Risking their emotional state.  Lots of women put up an electronic shield and keep themselves alone.  Let those women go.  All Women put up with a lot of crap from their Moms, their friends, the fashion industry, the media, and Hollywood.  Sometimes they'll take it out on you.  If it's a pattern, don't stay with her.

Mongoosen42,vegan,1389534818.0,"I would just like to add one point regarding the evolutionary argument. Remember that when you are talking about what any species has evolved to do, or in this case has not evolved to not do, what you mean is that the behavior or lack of behavior does not prevent reproduction. That's all evolution is, is those traits that either make an individual more likely to reproduce or else do not make it less likely to reproduce.

There are countless negative long term health consequences to consuming animal products. However, they are problems that develop over an entire life time, such as diabetes, osteoporosis, and clogging of the arteries. Vegans are at a lower risk for all of these things than meat eaters. However, these diseases develop long past the point where most people reproduce, and thus are not a factor in our evolution.

In many other omnivores you find a similar thing, that the individuals will be healthier on a plant based diet, but that meat eating individuals will not develop health issues until after the age of reproduction. Rats, for example, grow much quicker on a meat based diet, and appear healthier when they are younger, but rats fed a plant based diet will almost always outlive them.

Thus, to say that we are omnivores is not to say that we are supposed to eat meat or that it is healthy to eat meat. It only means that we can survive by eating meat long enough to reproduce.

That's my counter to the evolutionary argument."
PheonixManrod,summonerschool,1389534867.0,"You're not taking into account the skill needed to play an individual champion. Garen is easy, he's point and click, no resources to manage and very forgivable when you make a mistake due to his innate tankiness. 

Compare this to Renekton. First thing you notice about him is his resource, rage. Rage is simple in concept but takes experience to manage well. You need to know when you can hit minions to build it without taking too much poke and you need to know how often you need to make those hits to keep it from decaying. 

Furthermore, his abilities do different things depending on how much rage he has. So now instead of 4 abilites, you essentially have 7 since Q, W and E have 2 different effects (his ult is not affected by the amount of rage you have). 

So to review, you need planning/management of rage and knowledge of ability effects under different amounts of rage. This is in addition to the standard top lane mechanics of knowing how to farm, poke, set up a gank and general knowledge of the meta to know how your opponent will play depending on the champion. All in all, these are not skills you pick up in a few games. 

Rengar is very similar. You need to plan his abilities to maximize your damage depending on how many stacks he has. Again, his abilities work differently depending on stacks so you are really learning 2 abilities instead of just one. 

Now as for Sivir, Mal and Annie, they are all pretty straightforward. Annie is the only champ with any real mechanics to speak of and all that involves is skill rotation in order to ensure her stun is up when you want it to be ready. Sivir and Mal are pretty much point and click. You want to maximize your shield absorption with Mal but all that requires is a little patience, very similar to how Garen's passive works since you are already familiar with him. 

Conclusion: every champ has a different skill cap. The more complex the ability, the harder it is to play well. Conversely, the higher the skill cap, generally the more deadly the champ becomes in the right hands. Garen is a safe pick but not particularly threatening when his ult is down. A well played Kha'zix can destroy just about anyone with the right items and isolation damage with or without his ult. It's all about the champion. Give yourself the time to learn."

If this guy was driving recklessly and the law is in place, it seems like there should be a manslaughter charge, but this is pure speculation. Even then, the punishment isn't going to prevent or undo the damage that's already occurred.

Cute little anecdotes? I posted city stats showing the number of traffic fatalities and the top 10 causes of death in NYC (none of which are vehicle related). Your argument is nothing but anecdotal, based on some born-and-raised-New-Yorker expertise about traffic.

I'm not arguing the taxi driver was in the right or that this isn't a tragedy. I can't even imagine how horrible it would be to lose someone in this way.

Like, that's the actual source of the entertainment, I think, is not about the actual winning or the losing, but about the belonging, the being part of a tribe, the brotherhood of knowing that these people right here are your people, and that those other fuckers over there need to get their ass kicked. Or something. That seems to be the thing about it all, doesn't it?

So, someone who just watches the best team, to the standard sports enthusiast, must seem to have no loyalty. They must seem to be completely untrustworthy, and not someone that could be counted on to defend the tribe when the apes from the next valley over decide to attack and try and rape the women. Or something like that I guess.

I should add that these are just the observations of a man who has never enjoyed spectator sports."

Pertinent to the thread, I really think the sub should be recommended to people; it's such a good resource and most people don't even realise it exists - and it's not problem for the OP to just say no thankyou if they're not interested. :)

Could I ask you about what skincare products you use atm though, if you managed to buy cheap ones! Over Christmas I bought a cleanser/exfoliator/moisturiser so I could use the sub's basic skincare routine. I like the cleanser I bought, *Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash*, as it's on their recommended list. However I couldn't find a cheap chemical exfoliator, as their recommendation of stridex pads are a tad expensive; I currently use *Garnier's Anti-Blackhead Deep Pore Wash*, but I'm worried it's a little too harsh on my skin. Finally, I use *Simple's Hydrating Light Moisturiser*, which seems to work well for now; I'd like to try CeraVe but being from the US the price is ridiculously inflated."
IrideTheDirt,MensRights,1389538162.0,"Transgender is new. It requires surgery, hormone therapy, etc. It is a process to ""transition"" into the opposite sex so you feel on the outside, how you feel on the inside. This is something that IS unusual to the VAST majority of people.  It is a pretty damn new thing. What blows my mind is the attitude that surrounds it.  This attitude of shaming a person who doesn't know the particulars of what a ""trans-person"" goes through, what the proceedure is like, why they choose to transition, what sort of sexual preference do they have? ALL of these questions are ones that come up for someone whom this is all new to. There is often ZERO hatred or belittling of these people, simply a pure curiousity, and acceptance coupled with absolute ignorance to the topic, to the sensitivities, to the very intricate specifics of emotional and physical attributes that a trans person would experience. 
So, WHY would someone from the LGBT community just flat expect someone to fully know everything about it, and not ask ignorant questions that the mass of the public would like to know? How do you draw a line on the objectification of an actor, who's job is to portray a role, and essentially objectify themselves as tools of story telling through television, Where is the line? are you an actor? a model? do you do nude scenes? if so, how comfortable are you with your body being objectified?  Perhaps public figures, and those who want to be entertainers ought to grow a thicker skin and realize that when you're ""cutting edge"" or something a lot of folks know nothing about, you might get asked offensive and ignorant questions a lot. It's part of being ""unusual"". 

""I want to be interviewed about being transgendered so that I can help spread understanding and knowledge about transgendered people, but don't ask me anything uncomfortable, or that is offensive, but since you don't really know anything about my lifestyle you wouldn't know it's offensive, but I'll still demand you not do that because it offends me, and I have the RIGHT to NEVER be offended, especially about my choice to become transgendered!""  ....Riiiiiight...  reasonable.

IrideTheDirt,MensRights,1389539144.0,"Obeying the rules of your God might seem pretty important to you, if you followed a religion. He is in no way harming other's rights, oppressing women (unless keeping women from his presence is somehow oppression?). Why must his request be equal to the reasons women want a ""women only"" floor? If these women are seeking out a male free environment because of religion then the requests are exactly equal. If they are seeking out a male free environment because they ""Feel safer"" then its discrimination and prejudice against men. If they were attacked by a man, and now have problems being around men, they need therapy. If I were attacked by a black person, and then said I was afraid of black people, I'd be labeled a racist, and ridiculed for implying all black people would be violent, I would be mocked and demonized for my racist implications that because one black person acted a certain way, ALL black people became scary to me. And if I acted that way in response to such an event, I SHOULD be spoken of in such a way. It would be my responsibility to overcome my racist response to such a trauma, not the worlds job to accommodate my illogical response to a traumatic event.
The thing is, I have NO issue with a women's only dorm floor, but I think that a ""men's only"" dorm floor ought to also be offered for the same reasons they are offered to women. "

Fredericks was a middle of the road type of player that they moved to RB from RM fairly recently. Has only been on a short loan once in his career and has only appeared 1 time in the U-'X' national side.

OctaVariuM8,AskMen,1389539924.0,"Beauty is definitely culturally influenced, and that influence varies from person to person. I've grown up my whole life in New England, and the area I've grown up and gone to school/work in has been predominantly white (I am almost entirely Italian in heritage, so still ""white""). For a while before college I was the same as you, but only interested in only white women, as that was what I thought was beautiful. But now that I'm farther away from where I went to school initially, I've been exposed to a lot of different races and as a result, I've really been taken back by the beauty found in any race. 

I agree with everything you said and your observations and examples of beauty found in other races. I would venture to say that most of my friends have little interest in black women or middle eastern women due to us never really seeing one in person for many years, but now that I've studied with them in the library and/or worked with them at school, I can honestly say that I would love to date either race, Asians too (we have a fairly large Korean population at my school due to a great exchange program)!

When reading the CESG documents, and applying common sense, not all the risks are 'significant'. 

A better assessment by Canonical, or an independent third-party (which I do not have time for), could have been the following weighted sum:

    Rating = Sum (impact of risk * likelihood * risk significance)

where: *impact of risk* is a number (1--5) indicating the effect of the risk being exploited; *likelihood* a number (1--5) indicating the likelihood of that risk occurring; and *risk significance* a number (1--3) detailing the significance of the risk i.e. red amber or green.

As far as Satsuki, she's far more headstrong and seems to want to go her own way, and that's why she resists and overpowers her kamui (which could also be embedded with her parents' will). As far as we can tell, she doesn't even communicate with Junketsu at all. 

Another thing is that Ryuko's already mentioned she wants to know her father more, instead of avenge him. If Senketsu really is all that's left of her father, that would add another interesting facet to their relationship. "

neverenough22,nyc,1389541231.0,"&gt; Your bravery is so insanely annoying....you want evidence that education and tighter penalization will have an impact?

Absolutely. Isn't it reasonable that there should be evidence (a study, program from another city, etc) that proves your point? That's all I'm asking for: a coherent, fact-based argument that doesn't base its merit on where one has lived the most amount of time.

&gt; Of course it will! Education works, harsh penalties are absolutely a preventative measure. Are you really saying there's no room for improvement here? You really think we should do nothing and accept the deaths and injuries?

Let's look at marijuana prohibition then because ""education and harsh penalties work"". The DARE program, a program that educated millions of kids about the dangers of drugs, was discontinued because it was found to have no effect on drug use. Despite harsh penalties, drug use among teens has increased and continues to increase in most other age brackets.

But, by your reasoning, education and punitive measures should have worked. Drugs should be a thing of the past. But marijuana use is increasing, despite the exact strategy you insist on implementing. 

""Doing nothing"" is not the same as condoning or endorsing such events. Do I think it's a relatively rare occurrence? By the statistics, yes, it's extremely rare. Do we have evidence that what you're suggesting is better than ""doing nothing""? You haven't provided that information. 

&gt; Think what your arguing against mike, I'm merely suggesting that professional taxi drivers are further educated and held accountable for their actions and you're fucking with me like stuck up brat even though you've only lived here for 10 minutes.

Held accountable, absolutely. I'm not disagreeing with you there. It would probably help in some sense that the drivers be made aware that yes, if you're in the wrong and hit someone, your career is done. I don't know what's preventing that from happening, but I also don't think an HR-style talking-to is going to prevent fatalities. 

&gt; You've revealed everything about yourself on this website. You ask to have your appearance rated, and constantly dish out antagonistic comments, so I'm obviously arguing with a big baby which isn't very nice on my part, so ""Ok Gonna let this one go"". Lol

ballookey,exjw,1389541473.0,"&gt; The same ideal is kept in any organisation, such as pubs and sports clubs for example. In many pubs it is against policy to smoke or to wear singlets past a certain hour; if people choose not to abide by the rules set then they have to find somewhere else to do such things.

Not that you'll ever read this, but the difference being you can leave a pub or sports club any time and not lose contact with your entire family and friend network forever and ever amen. 

And the difference being, a pub or sports club doesn't raise you from infancy to reject all contact with anyone outside the club so that if, in the future, you *want* to leave, you feel suicidal because you don't know anyone outside the pub or club.

That analogy is TERRIBLE because it makes light of the extreme emotional distress that the threat of disfellowshipping causes which is something that even the Apostle Paul warned *against*:

The problem is that so many voters are not disgusted by poverty. In fact, many of them see it as a form of empowerment. If you're poor, then you have more incentive to do better. It's that protestant work ethic thing coming into play.

They are also highly disgusted by laziness, which they see as immoral. This allows the common voter to blame poverty on laziness without having to bring up the cognitive dissonance of the person working 75 hours per week struggling to keep afloat. 

Social Security is seen as a good thing because starving grandmothers are immoral. But, the starving 27 year old single mother is called lazy for not finding a better job and needing assistance to feed her young child.

**From experience, I have noticed not many people know this. So, I'll tell you this anyway, because there's not much information in the post and I don't know what your goal is and what your methods are.**

I'll tell you what decent progress is. It's 2.2 pounds per month. Why? Because the body can't make much more muscle per month than this. **4.7 pounds per month is more than decent and is definitely not slow progress (which you seem to think as I understand from your post).**

So if your goal is to gain weight in the form of both muscle and fat **(which I assume you want)**, you're doing an excellent job.

**However, on the off chance**, that your goal was to put on more muscle than fat. Then this is not exactly the right way and you should maybe rethink your strategy.

Cool!  I'd love to be proven wrong, and look forward to reading what sources you've found to support your dissenting opinion.

&gt;Virginity is obviously linked to inheritance, but it's also linked to distribution of resources. In any culture in which a man is bringing in the resources (food or money), he's not going want to pay for another man's child to eat. He's also not going to like some man coming around and threatening his family.

First of all, citation needed.  Second, women typically brought in substantially more food than men did in early agrarian societies, as well as in basically every hunter-gatherer society.  Things get more muddled when you get into heavy agraian societies--ones which farm land intensely enough that the development of crop rotation makes a big difference--but the idea that the men went and worked the fields while the women stayed in the kitchens is a modern fantasy.  *Everyone* worked the fields, and it wasn't until the Victorian age that you saw women shunted to the kitchen in the way you're envisioning.  Hell, in medieval times, women were often business owners.  Check out the life of [Margery Kempe](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margery_Kempe) for an example, albeit exceptional, of what it was actually like to live as a women before the early modern era.

&gt;I also take issue with your link to a blog (that I can only assume is your own), with statements like this: ""Humans do many things that seem to make no sense, evolutionary speaking. Things like altruism, monogomy and infanticide.""
All of those things make sense evolutionarily speaking. All of them. And the link doesn't support anything you're saying. It's subject is monogamy, not virginity.

First, it is not my blog.  I don't have a blog; my field is rhetoric and composition, not anthropology in any case.  I, personally, find blogs to be self-indulgent wastes of time, but I invite you to start googling paternity uncertainty in a search for usable sources that another might find readable and comprehensible.

Your ad hominem attacks are noted, however.

&gt;But the biggest problem I have is your focus on the west, as if it's the only culture that prizes virginity.

I focus on the west for two reasons.  First, because it's the general cultural framework which the US, which represents the vast majority of Reddit's readership, is a part of, for better or worse.  Second, it's because that's what I know, what I am qualified to speak about, and what--it seems to me from the context of the conversation--we're all talking about.

I won't challenge your lived experience as a 1980's teenager.  I was simply trying to come up with an illustrative example; it may have been a bad one, and if it was, I apologize.

However, this:

&gt;Your condescending tone combined with being completely wrong, just makes you sound like an ass.

Is simply rude.  As a piece of rhetorical advice in the future, descending to base name-calling tends to weaken your argument by making you look childish and petty.  It's always more rhetorically effective when you encounter a person who is arguing, as I am, from sources, to find better, more thorough sourcing and to use that sourcing to destroy your opponent's positions, thereby making him/her/me *look* like an ass.

For instance, take the blog you took issue with.  That was a prime opportunity for you to check the literature that I claimed to have checked and to use sterling, indisputable sourcing to dismantle that core component of my argument.  I'm sure you could have done it too, because I made the post in a sleepy rush as I was heading to bed.  Instead, as I observed, you opted to attack my character as a rhetor by insinuating that I was linking to my own work, and thereby acting out of self-interest.  Had it been true, it would have been a solid tactic; given that it's not, the allegation amounts to a personal insult for no reason, which makes *you* look bad as an arguer instead of me.  It's a high-risk gambit if you don't have anything to back the assertion up.

Regardless of your opinion of me, I wish you the best.

NeoSpartacus,history,1389542281.0,"it was all about accessibility. Those who lived far away from trade routes or large cities would typically avoid conflict until it reached a few days march. It also greatly depends on the geographic area you're speaking of. If you're talking about ""ancient"" as in classical Greece all the citizens of a city state would fight typically every summer. Almost like clockwork right before harvest time. If they were victorious then they could reap their opponents crops in contested territory. Plenty of times throughout history would crops be planted directly in contest to provoke a battle. It wasn't until the advent of the phalanx that battles would be decisive enough to end this cycle of violence.

Often throughout the Mediterranean and middle east, a battle would be decided by just two people. Think David and Goliath, the respective parties would pick two veterans to earn serious rep and glory. However the losing side wouldn't have had a definitive loss and would just come back next year before harvest.

Many of these societies didn't have the organisation required for a standing army so many ""common"" people would get caught up in war. Often if you were in a losing army and had no home to return to you would end up a mercenary until you won land to resettle. The Assyrians were one of the first nations to see the benefit of a standing army for the purposes of conquest. They were fed and supplied by common people so that they wouldn't have to serve, and the agrarian economy wouldn't degrade from massive labor insecurity.

However something that might help put actual numbers on things, The term *myriad* means an army of 10,000. The warring states period of China myriads would take the field with Cho-ko-nu or repeating crossbows with poisoned tipped arrows and fill the sky until one side was routed. The armies would conscript everyone they saw to fill ranks for about one half a year and then face the other army head on in battles before, you guessed it harvest time. The odds of surviving that year in service were very low.

Hope that answers a few questions."

To be completely honest with you, yes. I find girls who are 100% black to be less attractive. There's a few exceptions, but in general, I just don't see any appeal. Most black girls I've met have been extremely rude, and lacked many social graces that I take for granted not just from women, but from people in general.

On top of the rudeness, I've experienced most black girls simply CANNOT speak english whatsoever. I'm completely okay with other people who make grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes, etc. But if I can't understand what the fuck you're saying, it becomes a huge issue for me.

However, there's a half black and half white girl who I know pretty well, and she's incredibly attractive and not ghetto at all. So, I suppose for me, it's been mostly bad experiences with only the women who are 100% black.

ballookey,exjw,1389542881.0,"&gt;I still believe in God and I do still believe for the most part that there are benefits to living in line with the Bible's standards.

There's nothing wrong with that. I personally don't believe in god, to be honest, but for people in your situation, I think it's important for you to do some objective outside research into the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses. 

Yes, they've been teaching you this means ""apostasy"". But to paraphrase Carl Sagan (whom they quote in their literature and who therefore can't be considered apostate), If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth. 

What I think you'd be shocked to learn is how little JW teachings have to do with what the bible actually says.

Disfellowshipping as practiced by the JW's is unscriptural.

The prohibition against life-saving blood transfusions is unscriptural both with regards to the letter of the law and the *spirit* of the law as demonstrated by Jesus.

The bible nowhere promises a resurrection to paradise earth, but rather to heaven as most mainstream Christians believe.

You pick a major point of JW doctrine where they diverge from mainstream Christianity and I'm willing to bet it's unsupported by the bible.

So, does the bible condemn homosexuality? Maybe, maybe not. I'm not a language expert. But what I do know is that Jesus preached love, compassion, and to not be judgmental. He shared in association and worship with all manner of sinners and he did so with love and compassion. It's for him and god alone to exercise judgement over human souls (if you believe in that).

In light of that, it is *absolutely possible* for you to find love, to live with your loved one, to continue to believe in and worship god in a completely Christian way…

Just not with the JW's.

I invite you to check out JWFacts.com, particularly the part about [Questionable Doctrine](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/questionable-watchtower-doctrine.php). I want you to know that you are free to find love and express that openly without having to take your true self and stuff it into a prison cell.

With regard to your parents: Yes, they may be upset. But *seriously*. Any parents who would prefer their child be miserable or suicidal as long as that child worships god the way they want *are emotionally screwed up*.

You can't take on responsibility for their emotions once you start living the life you're entitled to. Because of the brainwashing and high control of the Watchtower Society, many Jehovah's Witnesses have a stunted and skewed set of emotions. It is not acceptable to choose misery to keep someone like that happy. 

You would be accepting misery and depression in support of a twisted and depraved facade of happiness."

Her W gives its range, all you have to do is place it slightly beyond your target for a double hit and run away.

&gt;did kassa ult in too close? STUN HIS SORRY ASS! Is your apc/adc getting dived by olaf? Peel for him!

This is general teamfight mechanics and completely ignores the resource management aspect. If you walk up to a fight with zero rage because you're joining it from a different position on the map, things are going to play out differently as your abilities won't proc their extra effect. Furthermore, if you have over 50 rage and you want a long stun, you can't slice and dice into the fight because that expends your rage. To play Renekton WELL, you must plan your actions before you even get to the fight. 

As a sidebar, I would also disagree Akali is easy to play. She essentially has 2 resources to manage and no defenses if her dome isn't up. I think it's easy to think she is easy to play because you see a fed Akali destroy everyone on your team but it doesn't always work out like that. They get fed because they know how to put out her burst which does take a little bit of skill to do properly. Not only that, but you really have to be extra careful pre-6. Shut down her farm early and it's gg. 

Lastly, comparing an ADC to a top lane is very useful. They are entirely separate roles.

Meek0n,AskReddit,1389543095.0,"During my time at secondary school I was lucky enough to meet and speak to [Tom Rosenthal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Rosenthal) son of famous sports broadcaster [Jim Rosenthal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rosenthal). I was a student at the time but am ironically a teacher now.

Tom is best known as a stand up comedian and actor. Although it was known for a long time that he would follow a career path in drama Tom still managed to achieve incredible grades at school as well as being an integral part of the school. 

I think everyone knew that he would be successful. He just had an aura about him. Aside from being born into a famous family he was incredibly hard working and had a superb sense of humour. He was an overwhelmingly likable person who would always be willing to talk to anybody. I feel that this trait in particular was integral to his success. Through a 'politician like' approach to social interaction he was disliked by NOBODY.

One of my buddies is Asian. He was a scrawny little fella in high school, but as soon as he hit college, he started weightlifting all of the time. Girls couldn't leave him alone after that, and NOT because of his body. His body was almost completely unchanged, because he had no idea how to lift. I mean he was terrible.

engineered_broom,AskEngineers,1389543782.0,"I think theres some confusion going on here. Moment of intertia and second moment of area are sometimes both refering to the same action but can sound like two different things. 
  
Second moment of area is basically saying the member is made of sheets of paper stacked up. Each paper sheet is infinitely thin. Each sheet also contributes to the strength of the member (compressive and tensile strength) based on each sheets cross sectional area (which is still assumed to be infinitely thin). The position of each sheet in the stack will also determine how much that particular sheet contributes to overall strength (based on moments around the neutral axis created by each sheets c/t strength). 

The second moment of area (also known as moment of inertia) is the mathematical representation of that through intergration of those supposed sheets of paper's strengths. These moments around the neutral axis will then represent the flexural strength of a section. 
  
Im not 100% sure about the radius of gyration but im under the impression that it is a quick way of determining along which axis a column will be weakest (buckling) and is also used in determining the slenderness of columns.

However, I still adhere to the ideals of feminism/egalitarianism (yes, they are the same thing, sit the fuck down), it's just that I avoid those hyperfeminist hives, like all the gender issue subreddits and sites like Oh No They Didn't! where that kind of attitude is bred.

I'd say it's semi-acceptable if all that's being included are aesthetic items that have no bearing on gameplay.

It makes more sense for games like Pokémon, on the other hand, because the game has multiplayer component that includes trading.

Oh really?!  Just a little inconsistent?  The pressures to be an indestructible motherfucker put upon them by their teammates does not seem relatable to the pressures some asshole boyfriend would have to coerce a woman to making a decision she may not otherwise wish to.  And abortions are an ethical  grey area, whereas getting treated for a possible concussion vs. not does not seem to be very grey to me.  No potential lives are at risk if you treat the concussion, but you're facing potential serious harm if you ignore the risk.

The idea of further loosening safety in the NFL seems absurd to me.  Concussions are serious fucking business.  Injuries are a part of the game, but shit, you shouldn't put a players life on the line like that just because some fans care more about the player's game than the player's life."

Knowing how to see things from his perspective can be more than explaining it away, it's an opportunity to reflect on your own actions and see what you could have done to change the outcome just as much as him. When problems arise in a relationship, it's an opportunity for both people to learn and grow. Having an entire sub rally behind just dumping and moving on reinforces the wrong behavior, in my opinion. Yes, dump the man.

That is not that big of a deal, but listening to the same thing over and over and over again can be. In the other hand, I still see a lot of positive stuff here towards short people, and warms my heart when I see people with flairs realy above 6' defending shorter people, or when I see tall ladies with short SO posting photos on /short just to cheer up a bunch of people that hey will never know. 

I think we should give it a try, and try to not look so much at what separate us, but what makes us the same, what makes us have the same or similiar problems and how we can support each other. There are both rants against tall people on /short or rants against short people on /tall, and they both bring us no good.

The SciFi channel and New Amsterdam Entertainment gave it a good shot back in 2000, and that version—which, frankly, is incomplete—ended up being about five hours long. I could maybe see the first Dune book done as a trilogy all on its own. *Dune Messiah* and *Children of Dune* would probably also need their own trilogies, which means you're at 9 movies by the time the story arc finishes. 

I can't even imagine the likes of Steven Spielberg or Peter Jackson or Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott tackling *Dune*.

ohyayitstrey,AskMen,1389545577.0,"""Pro-life"" tends to be just a position held that only results in voting once every 4 years.  Pro-lifers are also all across the board in terms of what they believe.  Many allow for abortion in the case of rape or incest, which I believe is wrong.  Many think they have won some victory when bills get passed that prevent abortion after 20 weeks.  This is an illusion of victory, not an actual one, for those bills still solidify the idea that it's okay to kill children.  
  
Many conservative Christians fall into one of these groups.  We often tell them how these positions are inconsistent with what they claim to believe.  We tell them that their apathy towards the issue does nothing to stem the tide of those who actively desire abortion to continue, thus being passive supporters of abortion.  Often, this doesn't go over well.  Sometimes it does, and you get people who realize their error and change. "

moose_man,fantasywriters,1389546721.0,"Originally, there were two gods- the sun, Anaxos, and the moon, Adnval. Both of them were too powerful to exist in the material world, and so the celestial bodies acted as conduits for the power and a way for them to watch their creation. Adnval created the world and Anaxos created the living beings on it. They granted mankind near-godlike power, but man turned it against them, constructing a device that would pull the gods apart. Anaxos was split into four parts; three small suns (known as the sons of Anaxos), Amahdin, Athanasios, Ephranis, and the fourth, unnamed god- more on him later. These smaller gods were less powerful than their father, forced into existing only in the material world. With the help of their uncle, the three suns tore down the civilization their power had built and forced man to start anew.

It's been a long time since then. For a long time, man fought amongst themselves, with no groups gaining dominance.

Then the gods picked sides.

Originally, the fourth brother, tired of being ignored, became a patron of man. His chosen were known as the Fell, which means darkness. The Fell quickly gained control over most of the continent, establishing a Fell Empire. The reign of the Empire was a golden age. The Fell used the gift of wit and cleverness from their god to create much. While they worshipped the three suns and the moon as well as the shadow god, their worship lessened as time went on.

The suns became tired of this. They decided they would lift up the other men who the shadow god had not chosen. Despite the counsel of their uncle, they have their chosen amazing powers over creation, fire, and lightning, one for each of the new suns. The wielders of this power were known as Stormfires. 

The gods determined that, even with this gift, the strength of the Fell Empire would crush their Chosen, so Athanasios left the sky and placed his essence in a man. This man became known as the Vessel. 

The Vessel led the Chosen against the Fell in a decade-long war that warped the world and shattered the Empire. In its closing days, the fourth brother, fearing for his people, chose a Vessel in the same way Athanasios did. The two Vessels battled, the god of fire against the god of shadow, for days. At the end, Athanasios' Vessel was victorious. He tore out the shadow god's essence.

Amahdin, god of creation, made a sword out of obsidian around his brother's essence. The fourth brother was trapped.

In the chaos of the war, the power of the gods had torn the land apart, and the remnant of that power had become an element known as deira. Deira was highly radioactive, and when its radiation became entrenched in mankind, it created new, wild magic, given by no god. 

These new mages, known as the mageborn, sided with the sun gods, and with the shadow god imprisoned, his people were weak again. They were forced deep underground with a joint effort by the Stormfires and the mageborn, and they created enormous locks to keep the Fell where they were.

Over time, a group known as the Black Order destroyed the records of this war and of both Athanasios and the fourth brother. The Order managed to kidnap the newest Vessel and stop him from passing on Athanasios' essence, leaving him in a state of eternal pain thanks to the sustenance of Athanasios' fire.

The fourth brother's sword was lost not long after the war ended. It was not found for centuries.

Now, the world worships the suns and moon separately. The Northerners believe mostly in Adnval, who they call the High One, and the Southerners believe mostly in the *two* nephews of Adnval, Amahdin and Ephranis, having forgotten the others."

ohyayitstrey,AskMen,1389546729.0,"In the Ephesians text, being submissive doesn't mean being inferior in the same way a team member is not inferior to a team leader.  Also note that husbands are to lay down their lives for their wives the same way that Christ laid down his life for the church.  How could a woman be an unworthy thing if she is worth laying down your life for?  The 1 Peter text speaks to the sexes being complimentary, not one better than the other.
  
""Born of woman"" is just a poetic way of saying human.  
  
The Timothy passages and the last 2 Corinthians passages again deal largely with order.  This is not misogyny, this is about avoiding chaos.  Not everyone can be a leader at the same time.  
  
The Numbers text is about sexual immorality.  Both men and women were punished for sexual immorality, so this is not an argument.  The Leviticus texts were about cleanliness.  There were cleanliness laws for men, for women, and for everyone.  How exactly does that make this specific to women?

JHemingway,short,1389546747.0,"I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tall/comments/1v1a8d/rshort_reaching_a_whole_new_bottom_xpost_from) on /tall just some minutes ago. In other/same words:

/tall, will you like it or not, is still the closest thing you can get to /short, and you can be the closest allies. I see a lot of comments here bashing short guys, even if they are not that agressive. It's a series of little things that accumulate, even if it's just ""I'm not attracted to short guys"". That is not that big of a deal, but listening to the same thing over and over and over again can be. In the other hand, I still see a lot of positive stuff here towards short people, and warms my heart when I see people with flairs realy above 6' defending shorter people, or when I see tall ladies with short SO posting photos on /short just to cheer up a bunch of people that hey will never know.

I think we should give it a try, and try to not look so much at what separate us, but what makes us the same, what makes us have the same or similiar problems and how we can support each other. There are both rants against tall people on /short or rants against short people on /tall, and they both bring us no good. I think we should stand up for each other more often, and bring that same positivety to real world. We are all human, we all feel the same way, but sometimes words can affect us differently, as we see."

Originally, I made three separate characters on three separate servers. Now, because some of those servers were merged outside of my control, you want to deny me access to characters I've spent good money on? Instead of just denying alert xp, which is the only incentive for 4th factioning in the 4th place? People aren't changing in order to be part of  a bigger zerg, that's just less certs per person.

When I broached the idea of a second date during a text exchange a few days later, he didn't reply. I gave it a day and messaged on OKC expressing my confusion. He replied his new job was more time consuming than he'd expected and he just didn't have the time to spend building a relationship. I wished him well and moved on.

A month later he contacted me again and the conversation picked up like no time had passed. He wanted to see me but I was sick and told him I couldn't. The texts got sexy and I felt he was just horny and wanted to get laid so I spitefully sent him some naughty pics and told him I hoped those would satisfy him. It was wrong of me and he said he'd leave me alone forever.

Three weeks later he messaged again, said he really wanted to see me. I was busy and couldn't see him. He then said it was going to be his only chance to get together because he was moving to Texas. What?! So, he just wanted to get laid then never see me again? No thanks.

Two weeks later, another message. How've I been? I asked how his plans to move were going. He said it was pushed to September and he hoped he could spend time with me. We agreed to spend New Year's Eve together. Then very quickly the conversation fell apart again and in the space of 20 minutes we went from having a date planned to him being angry I'd made a fool of him and me being confused as to what the hell he was talking about.

New Year's Eve he texts and asks why I'm ignoring him. I reply I hadn't heard from him since he'd cancelled the date. He replied he'd sent five texts I hadn't received and he hadn't received my follow up texts from the previous misunderstanding.

We iron out the misunderstanding and spend the night together. I haven't heard from him since.

I know a set of quadruplets who were born at 26 weeks. They weighed about a pound each. Now they're 13 with no health problems at all. 24 weeks is considered viability for a reason-- because it is quite possible to survive and even thrive at that gestation."

It was pretty clear from when we first started sleeping together that he viewed sex as an opportunity to masturbate using my body... and then just got increasingly frustrated that it couldn't do what his hand could. I was new to PIV sex and I didn't know how to deal with it. So I basically just stopped having sex with him.

When we broke up, he asked me what I considered to be a ""good"" frequency. I said, ""Um, five times a week?"" He replied, with complete disgust, ""That sounds awful. Who would want to have sex that much.""

My current boyfriend and I fucked five times yesterday, so y'know. 

I'm not opposed to porn - I'm opposed to the obsession and the reliance. My new boyfriend introduced me to porn... just as like, visual stimulation to aid masturbation. Neither of us need it or replace sex with porn use... it's occasionally a fun diversion."

If she still can't cover the costs, maybe she should give one up for adoption or find a family member or friend who can take them in. Its not ""me"" whos ""letting them starve"" theres a multitude of optiions this hypothetical woman could have used to prevent this child's birth (abstinence, contraceptives, abortion) or relieve it  as a burden (adoption) but she chose to have this child and keep it in her home. That is her burden to bear. She chose it. Under the plan I outlined, she would still receive support for it, but not enough to live comfortably at all. This, hopefully would make her realize that she cannot bring more lives into the world, and thus needs to start living smarter. The children, if left uncared for would most likely be taken from her and placed in foster homes.

gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1389549508.0,"My husband is much the same. For years, when my hair would be having what I call an ""80's day"" - huge and frizzy - I would complain and be annoyed by it, but he'd think it looked great. I've learned how to care for my hair in such a way that instead of just being frizz, I now have some waves and even a few loose curls...but even at that, I still have days of epic volume. I've learned to embrace it instead of being annoyed. 

It seems really common for women to be discontent with their hair though. I remember being in the dorms at summer camp and seeing all the work the other girls went through to make their hair ""presentable"" - all the blow drying and straightening and curling irons. Crazy. I get that we all have the message that sleek, smooth hair is the most desirable, even for us white girls, but seriously, why do we believe it? Why do we listen to that and learn to hate our hair for failing to live up to a standard that, for an awful large portion of the human race, is unrealistic? Most of us don't naturally have pin-straight hair, regardless of our ethnicity. And for those of us with curls or waves, our hair is not naturally perfectly sleek and polished. It's a ridiculous standard that is unattainable unless you're willing to spend a lot of time every day on your hair. And for me, one of the most frustrating things is that these standards which are put forth in the media are mostly held up and perpetuated by women and not men...it sometimes feels like we're playing into it and doing this to ourselves, and we don't have to.

&gt;I think that there's a disconnect between what people THINK attractive is and what other people actually find attractive.

The Democrats won't consider any offsets nor conditions on the aid.

This, and the food stamp issue, are a perfect example of why people in the GOP are reticent to expand aid programs.

Food stamps have more than doubled in the past five years... but a proposed 5% cut now ... meaning they'd only be 95% higher... is looked at as a catastrophic thing.

When the food stamp extension was running out... many outlets didn't report that fact.  They reported as though the GOP was *ending* food stamps.

Now we have unemployment *temporary* extensions running out and the GOP is being blamed.

Why should anyone vote to ok these things in the first place if, when they expire, one is going to be blamed for the expiration?

You can also use Borax instead of vinegar.  It does the same thing without the vinegar smell.  I usually alternate."

fuzzyllama1,gaming,1389550157.0,I love speed running so much. I stumbled across AGDQ 2011 vods on YouTube a couple years ago and have been hooked ever since. There is an amazing community for almost any game you can think of. Check out speedrunslive.com for more live streamed speedruns. And of course watch the vods from AGDQ 2014 there are some amazing runs!

I think it depends on your definition of ""romantic success"". If you're looking to just get laid a bunch of times, sure. If you want something more than that, I'm not so sure. I see an awful lot of average-looking, not conventionally attractive people wearing wedding bands.

I think that telling people they have to conform or be alone is worse."
