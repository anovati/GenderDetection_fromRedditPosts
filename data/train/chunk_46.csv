Keepa1,MLS,1391017388.0,"But where would an OC team even play? OC is highly developed already so there's not much room to build, and there are few colleges with adequate stadiums for 5-10 thousand fans (Fullerton's being really the only one).  Does Irvine have a stadium? UC Irvine plays on a field with no seating and I don't think they have a football team/stadium.

Anyways, I was staying at my uncle's house one night. I was on the couch facing towards the back part of the couch with my back facing outward, all curled up... I awoke in the middle of the night, probably 2-4a.m. or so. I felt completely frozen and out of the corner of my eye I saw a dark figure move behind me(since my back was facing outward). I could smell a mixture of blood and herbs, possibly marijuana. I started to feel warm breath on the back of my neck, but still, I could not move. It was probably the most frightening moment I've ever felt, but then, I don't remember it happening, but I fell back asleep. 

The next morning I asked my uncle about the house and apparently My grandmother was a Curandera(Mexican Witch-doctor) that cured people by exorcising them and she used to grow marijuana and other special herbs that she would burn during her exorcisms in order to purify their spirits. I was told that because several people had been exorcised in that house, that there were demons in the house... I asked him about the smell of marijuana, he laughed it off saying that it was my grandmother protecting me from the demons. she also died in that house"

lsirius,casualiama,1391017452.0,"The problem is is that we rarely get this sort of weather, so I'm not sure the city should justify the expense.  I guess you'd have to balance the budget on how much non-shutting-down the city equipment would cost vs how much we are losing today and probably tomorrow.  Atlanta is a pretty tech industry heavy city, so a lot of people can work from home, but it's really hurting lower wage workers that would have to go in.

Our mayor IS a dick.  He lost the Braves to the suburbs and decided to use hotel tax on building a new football stadium NEXT DOOR to the old one when our city has so many financial problems.  

Our city has some serious planning issues which lead to bad traffic and very few public transportation options which is also a factor here.  White Flight in the 70's led to many people moving out to the burbs, and the jobs following, so we have some serious urban sprawl.  In the late 90's people started moving back to the city proper, but many jobs are still in the burbs for cheaper rents, which leads to long commutes going either way, ESPECIALLY when there is no viable mass transit to get from the burbs to the city.  

So, I say all that to say, our mayor sucks, but he inherited a shitshow of a transportation issue, and this is just a symptom of that. Until we fix that and get the burbs and the city to work together to end this spread, it's not going to get fixed."

[The Wikipedia article on the wage gap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_gap#United_States) cites a source from the dept of labor that puts the gap not explained by controllable variables at between 4.8 and 7.1%

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1391017567.0,"1. Lagoon world. One massive supervolanco but not tectonic geology worth mentioning. When the volcano sinks, the world have formed an impossibly vast lagoon. Very politically interesting - long-range seafaring is completely pointless, and every nation will have a very small number of neighbors.

2. Mutagenic magic. The only magic worth mentioning warps the body, and that's virtually all it can do. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to do this consistently and in a way that doesn't turn into White Wolf campaign-fic. The idea evolved out of a certain horrible pornographic text game whose central mechanic is transformation. That game gets a lot of flak for being too furry. I think some serious fictional fauna work could fix this problem, but I'm not a fauna guy.

3. Increasing levels of nonlinearity. There's already a couple of fictions which are interested in this. Magic the Gathering and Malazan have low levels with common use of portal magic. Spiral Knights, an MMO, has a clockwork world where various sorts of strata rearrange themselves, with entire civilizations buried in the machinery. The highest, and closest to my idea is Bas-Lag's cacaotopic stain, a zone of incomprehensibility. While the stain tends to mutate everything, that isn't necessarily my interest - instead, I imagine a world with nodes, and around those nodes, the world is in flux. On the high-concept end you could talk about a macroscopic wavefunction, where areas have various chances of being something or another, and then observation of them causes them to collapse into a singular state. Describing the nodes is the part I'm somewhat stumped on."

superspeck,ProtectAndServe,1391017761.0,"They're working on it where I live, but we just got to regionally networked digital radios, so it's unlikely that another big upgrade will happen immediately. 

It's a lot easier to upgrade radio systems when you don't live on a chunk of land that's the size of Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, northern Italy, and about a third of France (Texas, in my case) with about 40 people per km^2. Our region (five counties) depends heavily on volunteer staff for fire, EMS, and search and rescue outside of municipalities... and even for surges in calls inside municipalities. The volunteers barely have the funding for the radios that tie into the digital net, but at least they can bring their own radios and interoperate. 

I expect you'll see relatively populated but still rural areas like mine (125 people per km^2) with lowly populated outlying areas (10-20 per km^2) switching over to the full digital encrypted systems in about ten years. I don't think it'll be nationwide, though. There's still too many areas that only have analog cell service.

In virtually every way possible.  Since it repeals Obamacare, it also repeals all of the mandates and tax increases that are a part of it, that *caused* the premium increases.

&gt; Obamacare capped the tax deductibility at something like $20,000...

No, it instituted a new 40% tax on plans where the employer benefit is more than $10,200 for individuals, or $27,500 for a family - which is going to be most employer-provided plans by the time the tax goes into effect.

&gt; ...this reduces it to 65%, increasing the cost of every plan by at least 12%. I am sure that the 12% increase in cost will have no impact on employers offering insurance.

The Cadillac tax is far from the only one that is involved in Obamacare.  There are dozens, at every level of the health care and health insurance industry, all of which increase the cost of premiums.  This plan would repeal them all.

There is a substantial difference in any case, between a reduced amount being tax deductible, and a 40% additional tax."

Foggalong,Android,1391017914.0,"Just to touch on that and correct a few misconceptions that may come from that video.

Linux is (or was originally) the kernel **not** the operating system, and it is this which is licensed under the GPL. Linux is now also used to refer to operating systems which use the Linux kernel but the other system features are not necessarily licensed under GPL.

Operating systems which use the Linux Kernel are often referred to as ""Linux Distributions"". In this respect both the Linux Foundation and Google's head of open-source regard Android as a Linux distribution.

Within Linux distributions, some build on-top of each other to take advantage of features, like Ubuntu is build on top of Debian. This happens quite [a lot](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg). The difference between Ubuntu and Debian is quite vast with different licensing, attitudes, repositories, interfaces, and even display severs.

However, sometimes a distribution creator will just take another distribution as a base and make less drastic changes. Maybe add some additional functionality (a lighter window-manager for example), use a different user interface, and different basic applications (web browser, office, email, etc). While these are technically different distributions they are more commonly referred to as re-spins. Sometimes they add independent functionality of their own and the more they do this the closer they get to been regarded as a distribution.

In my own eyes, Android here is the operating system. CM, Sense, PA, TouchWiz and the rest of the gang are all based on the central Android but whether each is regarded as a separate distribution or just a re-spin all comes down to how much they diverge from the base."

My eventual partner is sure to see me at my worst, whatever that is, and learn about even worse things in my own history, but hopefully we'll both want to fix those things. Why do I want to be with someone who just ""handles"" it? (If we're talking about how I'm kind of clingy or irrationally afraid of elevator buttons, then those aren't really me at my ""worst."")

(2) Your ""best?"" This is your best? You, right now, at whatever age involves posting sassy memes to Facebook, is your BEST? And we're all vying to experience being in the presence of this? It's the most egocentric thought imaginable.

Honestly, I bet that most people who see / like the meme are just in the mindset of ""I don't have to settle"" or ""I want someone who supports me when I'm imperfect,"" and those are perfectly good thoughts to have.

But there's a fine line to walk in terms of having self-confidence and esteem, and being conceited and rigid. Generally speaking, people should eschew these silly one-liners."

First, I want to say that The Simpsons has been a great part of my childhood and I cherish the memories of watching it with my dad all the time, so thank you for that.

Now. The Birdcage is one of my favorite movies. It’s just so fucking hilarious.  When Agador is forced to wear *de chooze* as the butler – I die.  Unfortunately, I can never find this movie anywhere, and so I was wondering if you maybe had a spare lying around that you’d maybe not feel too tore up parting with? It would seriously make my year. 

Lastly, I have been mimicking cartoon characters and making ridiculous noises ever since I can remember, so I was wondering how you got into voice acting. It’s something that I would really, really enjoy doing professionally if given the opportunity, and I’ve been giving it some thought lately.

kowalski71,EngineeringStudents,1391018023.0,"This is going to be a slightly round about answer.

A few years ago I would have said absolutely not. I'm really into engineering but not particularly nerdy. I'm a huge car guy and I tinker all the time, that's been the source of my passion for engineering. I don't fit the socially incapable part of the stereotype.

But as the years have went by I've definitely become nerdier. My interest in coding and microcontrollers has increased, I'm willing to compare calculators, and talk science. Even my attitudes towards fashion have skewed towards functionality, though I'm not quite at sweatpants and fanny pack level. Most notably my ways of thinking have been shaped by my engineering degree. This has been highly illustrated by my brother - once so similar to me that we were confused as twins and finished each other's sentences - and his very different mental processes after getting an anthropology degree.

So in short, if the stereotype doesn't fit you now then it will after you get a bit more into engineering. Most of the seniors I know who don't really fit the engineer stereotype aren't really all that into engineering for the sake of engineering."

fiveifrenzy6,SelfDrivingCars,1391018179.0,"The biggest issue I see with automating cars is that they are now at risk for hacking. If they are connected to any outside network to get traffic info or requests from the owner, then they can be accessed by unauthorized people. Imagine going to work when your car suddenly thinks the road is 5 feet to the left because someone fed it false information (sure the car has on board sensors to stay in lane but those could be altered or fed misinformation as well). Now you are veering into oncoming traffic and to your death. Not to mention a wide scale attack on traffic could restrict emergency vehicles from getting to a location. Allowing criminals to use it against us. Before this technology is available, security needs to improve.  I can guarantee that within the year these cars become main stream they will be hacked and it will be in the news to not buy them because of the risk.

That's an extreme hyperbole, but people cannot reconcile that they have unattractive qualities.  We're a society of special snowflakes where everyone's supposed to be put on an even playing field.

You have the point on corner C as (100, 0, 0) so I'm assuming that the points are represented as (C, B, A), please correct me if I'm wrong.

If the distance between each vertex is 100, then the pythagrean theorem should work.

But making your first move (100, 0, 0) to (50, 50, 0), you actually move closer to A.  the real point would be (50, 50, 100 - 50*sqrt(3))

ajdeemo,DotA2,1391018540.0,"Dive is a one-point wonder. The damage doesn't scale amazingly, and it keeps the same slow, cooldown, and range on each level. 

Fire Spirits is probably the best skill to max first. If you can refresh the duration correctly, it can deal a lot of damage and be quite useful in the midgame. 

Solar Ray is also good. Despite being % based, it has a huge range and is actually really useful. If you have huge slows or snares on your team, then maxing this first might be useful.

As with most heroes, take nova when you can. It scales well.

EDIT: [I did some quick math in another comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1whbjl/phoenix_skill_order/cf1yp7f) if you want to see a little theorycrafting of why I think getting sunray maxed second is better than dive. It's deceptively powerful."

nevertoo,redditpolish,1391018744.0,"*Source on all this: My mom got me the Sally Hansen gel starter kit for christmas. Been using it since.*

First thing you need to know about the at home gel kits is that there are two kinds. One that uses UV to set and one that uses LED to set. The UV light takes about a minute per coat to cure, the LED about thirty seconds. (I have the LED one. It's a little more expensive to get started, but there seem to be more polishes for it and many sources claim it's the future of gel nails.) 

In my one month of experience... I freaking love the gel. And like you ladies, I like to switch up my color all the time. (Read: at least once a week.) I also have a mass collection of normal polishes that I don't want to have disappear from my life. With this in mind, some thoughts I have on it are:

* Using straight gel polish definitely lasts much longer than normal polish. At least a week without chips, usually two. (And I mean absolutely zero chips, looks like you got your mani done this morning type of thing.) 
* But gel polishes are expensive and don't come in a wide variety of colors or sparkles... yet. So, alternatives?
* I've experimented some layering/sandwiching. *These are by far my favorite polishing schemes right now.* 

1. Sandwiching works by doing a gel base, polish center, and gel top coat. It lasts about the same as full gel... maybe a little less if you're impatient like me and don't let the polish dry before topping it off with gel again. My recommendation? Do the gel base, clean off the residue, then the polish, then wait a few hours and come back and do the top coat. Polish takes hours to set fully, even if it seems dry to the touch.
* Alternatively, you can go with my *absolute favorite scheme...* Polish base, polish middle, gel top coat. (Layering.) Be sure to give your polish a good long dry time though. For me, my nails last 6 days absolutely chip free this way. Usually after that, I start picking at them... so I don't really know if it lasts longer. It might.

* Finally, removal. ***It's not as hard as you think.*** Grab some foil like you would for glitter polishes and soak off the gel. It doesn't take very long (five minutes?) and you can use that time to browse /r/redditpolish for some last-minute-before-polishing-again ideas for what to do with your nails. Then you scrape it off, which isn't difficult - especially if you had polish underneath.

EDIT: Finally-finally, I don't know about you... but I LOVE the look of sparkles yet *hate* the texture. Adding a couple layers of gel as a top coat not only gives my nails that extra shine that gel is known for but it also smooths out glitter into a perfectly glossy surface. "

keypuncher,askaconservative,1391018842.0,"&gt; This is why I believe in getting money out of politics.

I do too.  Unfortunately the legislative body that has the power to do that also happens to be the biggest beneficiary of money in politics, and they are not about to legislate that away.

It would have to be done via a Constitutional Amendment coming from an Article V convention, because Congress would never pass it.

&gt; I would be able to vote for a Tea Party member if two things were accomplished. 1. They drop the religious zealot non-sense 2. They stop cramming their own heads up their own asses

Pay more attention to what they do and say, and less to what liberal media sources say about them.

&gt; Balanced Budget Amendment would take entirely to long to pass.

...but without it, government just sees increased revenue and spends half again as much as the increase.  We have done this for decades.  Continuing the same way hoping it will change is not going to help.

1957 was the last year we paid down the Federal Debt.  In 1957, 62% of the Federal budget went to Defense, and 6% went to paying down the debt.  Since then, adjusted for inflation and population, revenues have almost doubled - but spending adjusted for inflation and population has more than tripled.  Defense spending last year was 24% of the budget - that's a long way down from 62% - and yet we still spent 20% more than our revenues.

Without a Balanced Budget Amendment, that will not change until our government is no longer able to deficit spend because it cannot borrow money.

&gt; My primary area of interest currently is the defense budget. I think we could literally get that down to sub $375 billion dollars without doing more than minor damage to our military readiness.

You're talking about a 55% cut.  I think our military would disagree on the amount of damage it would do to readiness.  Essentially we could forget about projecting power outside our borders, or protecting our allies."

Jess_than_three,pics,1391019260.0,"Look, let me explain what I'm saying. 

This restaurant, I guarantee you, doesn't give employees *time* to clean. 

At the store I worked at, employees had side work they needed to do after they were cut for the shift but before they went home. Sometimes, if labor was really bad, we would need to tell them to just go, and then *we* were expected to do it. Beyond that, there was a specific set of stuff that was supposed to get done every night during closing. So, okay, cool. 

This store? No chance. Not only are they not providing that direction and structure, assigning tasks to individuals rather than just hoping people will decide to do whatever might need doing, but they aren't, I guarantee you, giving anyone the time to do it, either. It's slow? Cool, go home. No seriously, clock out right now. If it's *not* slow, well, you've got no time to stop and scrub out all the glasses or whatever - you have tables to wait on or food to get out. 

I guarantee you that this store isn't even giving its employees the *opportunity* to address these problems, much less the structure that's **necessary** to prevent them in the first place. They can't be expected to be able to solve for themselves a problem that's so systemic, and that starts with the store's GM and its owner if it has one. "

You think that, just because the A symbol is upside down, that the **key upon which it is imprinted** doesn't move from ""the left"" of the S key to ""the right"" of the S **key***, when you rotate your keyboard?

Do you really think that? Because I'm looking at my keyboard and they *key* upon which the symbol A is imprinted is now to the right of the *key* upon which S is imprinted.

Do you think that, when you rotate your keyboard, that the A key *turns into* the ∀ key? That they're not the same key?

***I AGREE WITH YOU***.

What you ***cannot say*** is:

&gt; The blue car is objectively to the left of the red car.

because all you have to do is go on the other side of the cars and that's not true.

Yes, human beings objectively discovered that there is an axis of rotation and that one end of the Earth is on the other end from the Earth with Antarctica.

I usually add my plants just before filling, as it's much easier to get roots planted before there's water in the tank.

When you *do* fill, get it about 3/4 full, then attach your heater where you want it, and get your filter set up. Once those are set, fill the rest of the way and then turn the heater and filter on.

As for CO2, it's not a requirement, but would certainly be beneficial if you're planning on putting high light and lots of plants in.

If that's something you want to avoid for now, no problem.

Pipstydoo,changemyview,1391019650.0,"The founding of America is the culmination of the Age of Enlightenment.  Certainly it was oppressive and exclusionary at birth, but there are some key aspects of its foundation which rocked the human species in a fundamental way.

First, it was the birth of a republic in which people had a say.  The Bill of Rights, a document which does *not* grant rights to people but instead *prohibits* government action, was crafted specifically *because* some of the Founding Fathers were afraid that without it whomever held the presidency could quickly turn the country into a tyranny.   The Founding Fathers understood that rights were inherent, which is why they created a document to limit government power.  They also made it flexible.

Second, the document was created to be changeable according to the needs of each generation.  In fact, my personal belief is that the physical document shouldn't be as revered as it is, which is something of a holy text.  I think the intent was that we could do away with it entirely and start a new document, i.e. start a new government as our needs evolved with the passage of time.

Finally, I would argue that the social changes within our country which changed it for the better would have been much more difficult if not largely impossible under other forms of government.  More important than form though, is the language we use.  ""Inalienable rights,"" ""created equal,"" etc.  I think they demonstrate the idea was to create something which, at a fundamental level, was made with the best intentions.  Of course, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, which brings me to your point.

Democracy, at its core, is not responsible for what you're upset about.  Capitalism causes these problems.  The free market is responsible for what you're upset about.

What market could be more free than the one which buys votes and favors within the legislative branch?

What market could be more free than the one which corners every industry and snuffs any competition?

What market could be more free than the one which dumps toxic chemicals into the very elements one which we depend for survival, and then simply whitewashes this with campaign contributions and PR campaigns?

What market could be more free than that which owns shares in the state and federal judiciaries, in the form of judges?

What market could be more free than the one in which a massively fraudulent financial sector can nearly bankrupt the *entire planet* and then receive free money with no oversight from tax payers at large (while they themselves avoid paying taxes by any means necessary) to continue to engage in the very same practices which caused the crisis in the first place?

Our democracy *is* broken, but not because it is a bad system.  It's broken because certain parts of it inevitably abet corruption, and because unfathomably wealthy people are the only voices which can meaningfully participate in it.

When you see an [article like this](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-worlds-85-richest-people-are-as-wealthy-as-the-poorest-3-billion/283206/) you can see evidence for what I'm saying.

When you watch a [special like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cFr2js7EsY) you can understand where to direct your ire.

So I urge you to kindle your anger and let it simmer until you need to channel it into whatever means you can to help spread this word or affect a change.  Just remember that it needs to be pointed in the proper direction.

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1391019890.0,"Syncretism is absolutely essential to making a good world. Unfortunately, it requires lots of *effort.* It's pretty easy to say, 'these are dwarves, they worship the mountain,' 'these are ~~fantastic Jews~~ goblins, they worship money,' 'this race is all warriors,' even 'this kingdom is like medieval Korea.'

Syncretism, in the wider sense, is adopting lots of different and divergent ideas. This has *always* been essential to human advancement - in science and in warfare, particularly, the advancements of one sector are quickly coopted by everyone who can possibly use them. The result of syncretism is heterogynous, and that's the most important point. No belief system or culture is the product of rational processes, it's the product of disparate factors.

To really bring this into your world, however, requires growing your cultures and peoples together. You can't start with a fully formed culture that fits into your plot, ideals, or themes perfectly, you have to include dissonant elements, and you have to spread ideas all around. It's not clean, it takes a huge amount of revising, and a certain attitude towards your world which values its realism over your own favorite ideas."

MidnightSlinks,TwoXChromosomes,1391020087.0,"A few problems. Women often aren't aware of unintended pregnancies until 2-3 months in. I'm not sure how much you have studied the physiology of pregnancy, but light bleeding is very common and often mistaken for a period. If the man gets 100 days, we are now looking at the end of the 2nd or beginning of the 3rd trimester or too late to safely get an abortion, and too late to legally get one--safe or not--in most of the country.

We also live in a fairly religious country. Something like half of women believe that abortion is morally wrong (though many of those women still think it should be legal for others). What do you say to the pregnant woman who doesn't want to raise a child alone, but whose religion precludes abortion? If your answer is ""oh well, don't have sex,"" I would encourage you to take a close look at how miserably the abstinence message has failed throughout history and if you still think that's a good message, turn around and preach it to men who don't want to be fathers.

The last problem is that pre-birth certificate. For starters, having a birth certificate is not a legal requirement. *Presenting* it is a legal requirement to gain access to many privileges in America, but the lack of one is not a crime. But if we can move past the fact that there's no precedent of requiring birth certificates, how exactly would this be a requirement? Is it a requirement of every pregnant woman? Only unwed women? Only unwed women who are considering keeping the fetus? How would you stop the religious right from making it a requirement that *all* pregnancies be recorded and then 1) using that as a state-recognized sanction of the fetus' life and therefore right to not be aborted, 2) requiring women to re-file if the pregnancy did not turn into a birth stating what happened (how emotionally brutal for women who miscarried a desperately wanted fetus), and 3) making it legal for people to obtain pre-birthcertificate records and create a list of women who have aborted. And what are the consequences if you don't file or if you lie when you say you miscarried when you really aborted. What about the women who don't find out in time to give the man 100 days and abort based on his decision?

It's an interesting thought experiment, but I think you need to go back to the drawing board."

GhostsofDogma,changemyview,1391020104.0,"It's not about being pro-choice or not, it's about swapping people like they're inanimate objects. The argument in the OP is framed around whether a disabled fetus should be junked in favor of a healthy baby; The argument is inherently about relatives, not the classic abortion debate. The smaller argument that came up in your post was about what possible reason there could be to not simply abort the first child and then try for another to replace it; that is what I am addressing. It is much different than the classic abortion debate as we are assuming here that the parents have the desire and the means to raise a child; we aren't examining the choice to have a baby, we're examining whether it is moral to pick and choose which baby once the baby has already been concieved.

I feel that comparing human beings' value like that is wrong. A perfectly healthy person could decide to live their whole life in their parents' basement and being nothing but am ungrateful burden, while a severely retarded child could positively impact the psychological well-being of their entire family and perhaps even their community; both situations have existed and will continue to exist. To compare human beings' value before they are even given a chance is to attempt to know the unknowable, and as a result it is not a decision I would endorse in good conscience.

It's easy to say ""better not risk it"" when you are managing, that's the choice I made.  But I think it is important to remember that there are women who are ill enough to risk harm to their babies as it is.  We all make hard choices sometimes, if we can at least be more informed we aren't asking people to suffer or risk other harms to their babies ""just in case""."

You can put a digital D-Pad on the touch screen, but then you have to reach over the ABXY buttons to control the camera, which I find unwieldy to do. 

The CPP puts another Circle Pad to the right of the ABXY buttons, making it easy to move and control the camera at once while still having easy access to the ABXY buttons.

On a non-scriptural note, it's just a weird thing to say.  We all know that genocide is worse then not filing cash income on your tax reports.  It defies all common sense to assume that it is somehow just for God to ignore that there are levels of severity in offenses.

Don't misinterpret me - all sins harm our relationship with God.  But not all sins totally sever that relationship.

EDIT: [Matthew 12:31 NRSV] and [John 19:11 NRSV] also speak that there are levels of sin.  There may be other ones, I'm not certain."

fiveifrenzy6,SelfDrivingCars,1391020199.0,"Traffic lights are not personal devices. They are most likely on a secured private, not to mention government, connection and not wireless. This is why you see police controlling lights from boxes on the light posts in times of heavy traffic for events. People try to break into the police departments networks on a regular basis and they don't succeed. I'm sure the same goes for the network that the traffic lights are connected to. However if someone decided they wanted access to my mobile device while I was in a public place, they probably could do it in a matter of minutes no matter the security I put in place (more security just takes more time/processing power). How could a personal car with a personal computer controlling it be that much different? It is not constantly monitored and protected like a secure government network. I do not have a security team actively fighting intruders with my car. You are comparing two very different things. 

Also the government cannot actively monitor your personal networks/devices or apply methods of defense because that breaches hacking laws (forget what the NSA has been doing, its not important to my point). If they could legally then they could actively stop malware and other things by activating anti-malware on personal networks/devices to combat it. They could also make the entirety of computers their own botnet to fight cyber criminals but that is still illegal.  So cars with their own computers will be classified as personal devices since you own them, and will not be protected except by security that is hard built into the car on purchase. Sure there will be patches and security updates that are released just like with any technology but it will still be a huge problem. "

EaglesOnPogoSticks,anime,1391020207.0,"If you compare any two random languages, you are almost guaranteed to find that they do not completely overlap when it comes to vowel and consonant sounds. Trying to learn those sounds that aren't in your own native language is a big pain for most people. As already pointed out, ふ is a syllable which can only be approximated in English, and many struggle with the pronunciation because it kinda doesn't exist in the native language.

The same thing happens with loan words in the English language. As a Swede, it's really weird listening to people saying 'smorgasbord' since the proper way to pronounce it in English is not the proper way to pronounce it in Swedish. Trying to explain how to properly pronounce 'smörgåsbord' is much harder than simply removing the umlauts and letting people pronounce it using sounds which are much more common in the English language. It's all about approximating unfamiliar sounds using what you already know."

The fact that it's so subtle but also has enough evidence to support it is why it seems like it must be true.  The main reason this theory is so much more supported than the others is because when it comes down to it R+L=J is such a great plot point that you really want it to be true since it adds so much depth and huge plot implications to the series.

TLDR: R+L=J is accepted because it adds a lot to the series in a great way and it's subtle enough not to be a red herring."

mczbot,soccer,1391020379.0,"have you actually seen julian play on a regular basis?
he can only play left winger and central offensive midfielder. despite being both footed, he is extremly weak on the right side, for whatever reason.
that means he would have to start over özil or carzola. you see the problem here? aside from that, for whatever reason, people seem to hype up draxler to spheres where he just isnt at right now. his prizetag comes from his talent, not his ability. cause if we are being frank, draxler right now aint better then the average bundesliga midfielder. i'd even rate holtby right now higher then draxler (that being said, draxler has way more potential). out of our offensive line, draxler is the weakest link. heck, podolski even is a better winger then him right now.
also, he still is injured. and once he would be back, he would have to get to know his new team and then also get to get used to the premier league. so please tell me again, how is a transfer not gonna affect his wc ambition?

the bonus he has at schalke is that he is right now pretty much untouchable. once hes back from injury he'll start again. simply because we dont have any other options on his position AND because hes homegrown"

biffysmalls,SquaredCircle,1391020764.0,"You're being pretty overly dramatic, but I'll respond to you OP, point by point...

- My parents wouldn't have shelled out $10 a month for WWEN, but despite being violent sociopaths and narcissists, they claimed to abhor violence on TV as it (and not the table lamps being tossed at each other on a weekly basis) would make me a violent person. This was true to the point that I wasn't allowed to even own a water pistol. My memories of watching wrestling when I was a kid were always with my aunt and cousins on the weekends, who were every bit the marks that I became and who never told my parents. 

- If I had kids and didn't care about this shit and $10 a month would make them happy? So long as they wear headphones and keep it off my TV, I would be more than happy to switch from Starbucks to McD's for my morning coffee to offset the cost.

- You are overestimating the value of social media in brand positioning to market to the casual fan. Much like the NHL in the United States, people know its there. It has a niche audience, even among its hardcores, just like WWE. This week's bullshit gets us all here talking, but it won't matter to the casual observer.

- Hence, this only really impacts us, and you GROSSLY overestimate the impact the IWC has on the casual fan. Whether we like it or not, we are the obsessed cosplayers at ComicCon that the other 90% of the attendees look at with confusion, and think should lighten up. We obsess over this job or that job the way those nerds obsess over finding series-authentic textiles. Those nerds do not drive ComicCon business. We do not drive the Wrestling business. That is never going to change, no matter how melodramatic the IWC's lame tweets and instagrams and facebook posts get."

Uka-sama is literally a [god of conquest.](http://kakeracomplex.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/god-of-conquest.jpg)

I really like how the series is handling transformations. The animators are doing a great job of dealing with body language and mannerisms - as we saw when Inari transformed into the assistant principle and when Uka-sama's brother transformed into Inari. Last week, as well, when Inari transformed into Tanbabashi's friend.

Anyways, I mut say that they are really accelerating the story along, compared to the manga. I'm definitely fine with that - this is going to be only 10 episodes, plus an OVA, I believe, so that makes sense. I think they are doing a great job so far with pacing the series - it has definitely maintained a lot of the great humour from the manga, as well as the overall atmosphere of it.

they_call_me_hey_you,Eve,1391020817.0,"&gt;I have 7 years of WoW experience, and many more in general gaming. Whats a good thing to do upon initial start up?

I too came from WOW - Do not immediately go for bigger ships. They are not necessarily better for what you are doing at the time.

You are not your ship. Think of ships as expendable ammo and as a class in wow.  Tackle frig is CC, Logistics is a healer. The thing is, you can fly either depending on the skills you choose to learn.

Until you know what you are buying, fancy faction ships and mods are a waste. Resist the temptation to gear up. Although Meta 3 and 4 stuff is quite reasonable to use. Named items costing millions more are not the same as a purple helm of a set if tier x raid gear..

I suggest you spend a few days doing ALL the tutorials to become familiar with all of the basic game mechanics. It is a bit is a drag but so helpful in the long run. 

Following that there is an Epic mission that you can begin after completing one of the tutorials called 'blood stained stars', commonly referred to as the Sisters Arc. Do that it gets you moving around and you pick up some good starting money.

While doing those things read up on different new player friendly groups. Eve Uni, RvB, Dreddit, Fweddit, and Brave Newbies are the ones I suggest you think about first. Worm Bros are also an option but you should probably wait a few weeks before trying a wormhole you need more skills for that.

Som jag förstod så var deras främsta argument att kommunen fokuserar på fel saker när det gäller att värna om miljön. De har en vegetarisk dag för att värna om miljön men bryr sig inte det minsta om ifall råvarorna är närproducerade eller inte. De menar helt enkelt att det hade varit bättre för miljön om man försöker öka mängden närproducerade råvaror i skolmaten vid varje måltid (även om den råkar vara köttfri) istället för att ha en vegetarisk dag i veckan. Detta kommer dock aldrig hända då Sodexo (som står för luncherna på alla kommunens skolor) gör allt för att för maten ska vara så billig som möjligt, närproducerat skulle helt enkelt vara för dyrt.

Tycker personligen att aktionen mest var löjlig och bara ett sätt för LRF att få lite PR, vilket de tycks ha lyckats med.

kornberg,relationships,1391020932.0,"He's not just sitting around at home all day being unemployed. He's in school, which you should consider his ""job"". My husband worked while I was working on my undergrad. I did a lot of the housework but I expected him to help out, especially on weekends because I was taking 18-22 hour semesters to get done as soon as possible and I did not have the time or energy to do everything. When I got bogged down with school (usually for midterms, finals and thesis), he stepped up his efforts so I could succeed. He hates his job as well but he stuck with it because it was the best thing for us at the time. 

Now, I've graduated and I've been working at a job that I am not fond of but pays well so that he can find a job that fulfills him. Since I am in an evening masters program (MAOD, not MBA), he still takes on a little bit more of the housework but it's evened out a lot more since I work outside the home and he does not. I have also given up the gym and a lot of my hobbies due to exhaustion but I keep reminding myself that this is temporary. It's like an investment--I give up something I would like to keep so that I get more of it later on. So I get it. I really do. It sucks and there's nothing productive you can do about it right now. 

Things that help me are to go somewhere between work and home. If you can hit the gym for 30 minutes or just walk the block before going inside or get coffee somewhere or whatever--just give yourself a space between work and home. It will help you leave work at work and you can focus on home when you're at home. As for healthy meals, the crockpot is your friend. I take an hour or so to make up batches of soups and whatnot and toss them in the freezer. The night before, I take something out and then I toss it in the crockpot before I leave the house in the morning. You can also have your husband do this--for example, when I made ham and lentil soup the other week, I had masking tape on the lid that said to add 1 c of water and the container of chicken stock in the pantry--put in crockpot and leave on low all day. You save a shitton of money and time. Yes, you eat a lot of soup but soup is fucking delicious. Doing things that are reminiscent of what you want really helps you feel a lot better. 

Another thing you should do is talk to your husband about this. Say ""Honey, I work long long days and I am exhausted. I know you're working too but you spend more time at home than I do and I'd really appreciate it if you took on a bit more of the housework. It's brutal to be gone all day at this shitty, awful job that I am trapped in and come home and have to make dinner and do chores because by the time I am done with doing everything that needs to be done, it's time for bed and then it just starts all over. I just want 30 minutes or an hour to unwind without having to worry about getting everything done around the house that needs to be done. I know you're working hard but I am too. Just because I am tired doesn't mean that things don't need to be done and I am feeling like if I don't do it or badger you about doing it, it won't get done and that makes me feel very alone in this marriage. You're staying up late, sleeping in and spending a lot of time around the house and it's hard for me not to be mad or resentful because you expect me to carry a big chunk of the household stuff in addition to locking myself into this shitty, awful job. I know it's almost over but I am asking you to please, please help me out more. Take down the stupid Xmas tree, clean the kitchen, go to the grocery store--I'll help but I need you to help me out a bit more. I don't want to nag or be bitchy but it's getting to the point where I just can't take this any more.""

He needs to know that you're at the end of your rope. You're not mad at him, you're just mad at the situation and you need him to step up his contribution. I had a very similar talk with my husband over the holidays and he really took it to heart. I wasn't accusatory, I was nearly hysterical from the stress and exhaustion tbh, and he made a few counter arguments which I did not take personally but was able to counter back. He made a lot of big changes and so far they've stuck. He isn't psychic, you have to tell him that you're about to explode.  "

JasonWaterfall,MensRights,1391021134.0,"I see some parallels here with Roy Baumeisters work on sexual economics.

But the author is very wrong, I think, about the consequences of making sex a commodity to be traded like any other:
As Baumeister shows, it is women who benefit from traditional sexual morality, because it prohibits establishing an efficient market for sex. Instead there is a kind of sexual cartel where if you undercut the agreed upon minimum price for sex, you are ostracized and slut-shamed (or prostitute-shamed, I guess).

So if women really started to openly treat sex as a commodity to be bargained for, and stop shaming each other for acting like that, the ""price"" of sex would fall, not rise.

Not that I foresee that happening or would welcome it if it did."

I've never met anyone who acted like that in real life, even though I've known and dated plenty of girls. I think you can easily just ignore that whole worldview and interact with reality and with real people. I don't think the misogynist attitude holds up very well in the light of day any more than radical feminism does. And if you go around with a chip on your shoulder talking about the evils of the other gender, you'll be very comparable to the kind of radical feminist you're railing against. And even if some girls do have those kinds of thoughts sometimes, you can ""prove them wrong"" by being a cool, reasonable guy.

I don't think girls are luckier than guys; some individuals are luckier than other individuals, but as groups, there are pluses and minuses for being either gender. I understand sometimes it's good to fight for the rights of a group you're a member of (like black people in the 50s) but I'm really just not seeing a huge amount of societal benefits that girls enjoy over men.

werewolfchow,Bravenewbies,1391021429.0,"The best benefit of Eve is that you can fly whatever sort of fleet you like. ""Tank"" in Eve refers to the type of defense that a ship uses, and typically fleets are either armor tanked or shield tanks. There are differences between the two, and ships generally have a better setup as one or the other, but the reason to be uniform across a fleet is that your logi (logistics, or healer) can only repair one type of tank, shield or armor, and you want to be able to use those reps on any member of the fleet.

Tackle is also super important, because if you want to kill a ship you first have to catch it. 

But these ""roles"" can be compressed into ships. Ships can self-repair with limited effectiveness, or tank in different ways (like being small and hard to hit), and any ship can fit a module to ""tackle"" or keep a ship from warping away. Certain modules shut down your enemies warp drive so they can't flee the fight. 

ewar means electronic warfare, and includes a bunch of types of modules that affect the ability of other ships to target, damage, move, etc. This is highly context-dependent. If you have a fleet that deals damage up close, you want to slow down your enemy so they can't get out of range of your guns. If you deal damage at a distance, you want to keep them from targeting you at long range. You want to jam your enemy's healer so they can't rep their team. But you don't always need a dedicated ship for that. the modules can be rolled into other fits so your dps can also do ewar.

Basically, to answer your original question, it's a lot more flexible than more traditional MMOs role-wise, and you can quickly change roles to whatever your skills let you fly, and there's no reason to be limited skill-wise to just one ""role"" on your character."

We're not assigning blame here, just comparing average men to average women and their advantages in society. What difference does it make for how much your life sucks that you share a chromosome with the person who sent you to die?

&gt; Thirdly, and here's the kicker, if you look up US Code, Title 10, Subtitle A, Pt.2, Chapter 37, Section 652, Pt. A[1] you'll see that when women are allowed to be military combatants, selective service will then be applied to women as well. 

This actually happened more than a year ago.

On January 23, 2013, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta removed the military's ban on women serving in combat.

&gt;They aren't benevolent to men, they're benevolent to women. You have to look at this from beyond just the perspective of men and incorporate how it affects all parties.

Fuckin lol. What the hell. 

You're the one defending moral bias ffs. I'm supporting universality. The draft is bad for men, so it's bad for women. Denying the right to vote to women is bad for women, so it's bad for men. Don't label something as good *when it hurts other people*. This is not hard to understand. "

As far as I know, money laundering is about taking money which were the monetary proceedings of criminal activity and converting it into a different form of value.

What they did was provide bitcoins to users who were then themselves responsible for anything they do with that. Much like the way any ATM at a bank works or somebody paying out salaries to people who then use it for criminal activities.

How could Charlie be responsible for anything that somebody does with goods that he didn't even supply directly?

The only mistake I can see in the indictment is his suspicion of one of his users that had a higher daily order than he was allowed to and failiing to report it. But unless you can prove that those cash deposits came from criminal activity, I don't see much more of a case here.

HabseligkeitDerLiebe,AskReddit,1391021934.0,"1. My main point is that the ""fact"" that GMO are not well studied is wrong, and that drives me nuts.

2. GMO products are used extensively in Europe. When was the last time you used some cheese? The rennin to make it is from genetically modified organisms. Or vitamin C (powder)? Or citric acid? Or pretty much any pure animo-acid or their salts (MSG among them)? All from genetically modified organisms. But for some mysterious reason this is OK, it doesn't even need to be labeled, but when I use plants for the same thing it's all evil.

3. I also don't like some of the practices of the corporations involved in the commercialization of GM plants. I also don't like the practices of some other corporations. But just because I have a problem with Nestlé (an European corporation, btw) buying up water rights in developing countries and then selling the population water I don't have a problem with water pumps or bottled water.

4. I'm not like ""Just throw it into the market, no questions asked!"". I think we should introduce regulations that can actually be held. I think we should educate the population about what gentech actually is. Our policy has to change in a way that it is profitable to make GM plants by European rules, so that products are developed for our market that meet our strict regulations. That way a company could create a product that could be sold in all legislations in the world, de facto exporting European standards. The way we do it now we are actually responsible for the things that these corporations do in developing countires."

FreyjaSunshine,AdviceAnimals,1391021965.0,"It doesn't matter what we charge.  Insurance companies pay what they pay, and most doctors will have a separate price list (or offer a discount) for self-paying patients.

I can charge $500 or $5000, and if my patient has Medicare, I'm getting $16.75 per unit (anesthesia billing is super weird), so maybe $83.75 for a short case.  But I'll only get 80% of that.  The patient (or secondary insurance) is responsible for the other 20%.  And then I have to pay my billing company.  If it's Blue Cross, I might get $35/unit.  If I charge less than they pay, they will pay what I charge.  If I charge anything over what they pay, I get what they pay, and that's it.  Every insurance plan has its own fee schedule, so for doing exactly the same thing, I might get $80 or I might get the $500 that I charged, but most likely, something in between.

Or I might get nothing at all.  If the patient doesn't complete a ""Coordination of Benefits"" form, or if the wind is blowing the wrong direction, insurance might just not pay at all.

I choose my billing amount to be slightly higher than what the best insurers pay.  I offer a discount for uninsured patients to a rate that is on the lower end of what insurers pay, and I'm willing to work with patients who can't afford that.

I hate the game.  I would like to charge a reasonable rate and get paid that, and ditch the billing company.  But I can't afford to spend 2 hours on the phone to get paid for a half hour case."

Neebat,bestof,1391021982.0,"The only good part of your response is how many of your own examples were caused by the government, mostly in the ""ineffective"" category.

Government bridges on government roads.  Public markets heavily controlled by the SEC.  BP Horizon, where BP's damage payout was limited by government regulation, operating with a lease from the government.  West fertilizer, which was never inspected by the government agency that we put in place to regulate it.

And let's not forget corporations, which are a legal fiction created by government.

Punishment for rape or killing people on the highway weren't created by the government.  The government stepped in to stop people from outright killing the perpetrators.  The idea that you could tell how dangerous someone was on the highway based on Blood Alcohol Content *was* created by the government.  And like so much of the government's work, it fails to take into account dozens of more dangerous conditions.  So they pile on more laws on top of more laws without stopping to think that we should be measuring the driver's ability to drive, not their ability to take a breathalyzer. 

Just wait until you see what happens to drivers in states with legalized marijuana.  The most common tests check whether you've had marijuana in the last 30 days, so people will be (if they haven't already) convicted of driving under the influence when they haven't had a joint in weeks."

Mh3u really eased me into it. Finally learned I needed to gather stuff and the game really let me learn the basics. I farmed all the gear in low rank village because I wanted to. High rank was challenging until that first set of armor. Learned more about skills. Now just made it to G rank and love it. The armors look awesome and the monsters are challenging for me for sure. But I know that I've greatly improved and have still so much more to learn. 



Looking back at my FU file, I looked like a completely lost individual because I was. I was dropped into that world with no real good explanation of how everything worked and was overwhelmed.  I personally am happy that mh3u has been ""easy"" because it allowed me to learn and love the game. If I were to make a new character, I now know the game and how it works well enough to zip right to G-rank where all the tough monsters are.

fiveifrenzy6,SelfDrivingCars,1391022084.0,"I'm not going to explain hacking to you that would take pages. I will try to find examples when I have time.

You do know that there is no type of commercial security that hasn't been broken, right? As soon as a new security encryption method is released it is just a matter of days/weeks/moths before its broken. So why do you expect anything in the near future to be different?  Security is to keep out honest and inexperienced people. Sure you have locks on your doors but that will not stop a burglar if they want in. The lock only makes it a bit less desirable to get in.

The reason private networks are not hacked is because they are monitored by security professionals who actively work to counteract attacks. Your personal car does not have a team of people monitoring it and protecting it, just like your computer doesn't. That is your responsibility and I'm sure you couldn't afford to hire them.  You don't seem to understand computer security if you think your mobile device is in any way safe in a public area. If you have bluetooth on I can within minutes access everything on your phone, files, contacts, any other information stored there. Same if you are on wifi. I've not experimented with doing it through 3g-4g networks but I'm sure that is also possible. 

Edit: [take this as an example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpPAjVh3dM). This is a current car being controlled by a computer. Just by plugging it into the car. Now imagine the car doesn't need a plug to be accessed.

They'd likely describe both participants as male, along with other details.

Also, your research reminds me of a bunch of articles I recently read on Compassion. I'm sure you've looked at some too, as they're tangentially related. The classic concept of men are aggressive and women are compassionate. The studies I've read show that men and women are equally compassionate too, and they also just show it in different ways. However, in this case, Compassion is described from the perspective of the female, instead of from the male like Aggression.

HabseligkeitDerLiebe,AskReddit,1391022751.0,"My comment wasn't even long...

The general results of the multiple studies is:  

* The negative ecological impact of GM plants is not greater than that of conventionally grown crops. Often they actually have a reduced impact.  

(CARPENTER J.E., „Impact of GM crops on biodiversity“, 2011

SANVIDO O. et al., „Ecological impact of genetically modified crops: ten years of field research and commercial cultivation“, 2007

AMMANN K., „Effects of biotechnology on biodiversity: herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant GM crops“, 2005)

* There hasn't been any reported case of negative health impacts of commercialized GMO in humans (except pre-existing allergies to the introduced products).

These are the facts. Some have fears about a gene-transfer into wild plants. But this also happens with non-GMO plants that are conventionally bred and no one bats an eye. I don't understand what's the difference.

I just have never heard any argument for the total prohibition of GM plants that was based in facts, logically coherent in itself and not religiously motivated."

L1M3,elderscrollsonline,1391022783.0,"The only thing I have a slight issue with is an exclusive race for the deluxe edition. I see a lot of people complaining about potential imbalance due to imperial racials, bit I don't think the exclusivity of the imperial race adds any imbalance to the game; I also don't think that matters. The Elder Scrolls have always been about player choice, and letting players choose who they wanted to be. Some players love imperials and only play as them, and it's those players whom I feel for.

Back when it was announced there would be no Imperials at launch I was taken aback; personally, imperial is only my 3rd or 4th favorite race but I couldn't believe they were going to exclude what is possibly the single most lore important race in the game. But now that they are making imperials playable for a price it feels manipulative. 

I'm holding out hope that there is a way to unlock imperials by playing the game. We already know that the Rings of Mara are available in-game, so the exclusivity of the Imperial Edition content is already suspect. But even if imperials are unlocked in-game it won't make everyone happy; then you will have people who bought the Imperial Edition complain about being lied to.

ulvok_coven,worldbuilding,1391023015.0,"Necromancy was once the purview of traveling sorcerers; captive souls of the recently dead were taken, housed in crystalline form. The reanimation of the dead was less useful than the mere consumption of soul-energy for various magical purposes. The lay-people had understandable moral concern, but mages... not so much.

Unscrupulous would be the wrong way to describe them. Dren Ora, the rite of necromancy, offered an unbelievable temptation to those mages who would not pledge themselves to the petty gods. A ploy by a dead goddess for resurrection ended with an unlikely and reluctant spirit relegated to rule Dren Ora, and as such it was the only rite of note which required no divine pact. The magic of life and death, with an absentee mediator. Theorists and arcanologues jumped at the chance to develop the techniques of abdeath – and of course, immortality.

Unfortunately, souls don't want to stay dead. The problem of arcane leakage was solved by a name lost to history – the creation of small homunculus, like a cross between a stalactite and a scarab beetle, which solved numerous technical problems with keeping a soul in the limnal state. A few escaped, but what harm? They were not properly alive.

In fact, much more harm. There is an ecosystem of magic, too, of which the gods are apex predators. In the wastes of the ill-known west they coalesced, a swam of the abliving. The Urnah, a collective god in its own right. They recruited not amongst the living, but among the dead, and built a vast necropolis-temple where hundreds of the reborn dwell in absurd urban grandeur. To their ends the Urnah used their power to christen an order of mighty undead. The corpses of heroes from battlefields the world over, their faces and pasts ablated, protected and tempered by sorcery, and loosed upon the world.

During nearly every part of the Requiting they were present, but made no play for the god-seed; as such, their motives are truly unknown. They have opposed the archmages of the Court of Cinder, the orthodox of Dren Ora, but they have not yet sought the throat of the nominal god. The study of necromancy is generally opposed now, with the threat of the Urnah against the living being so great. With the Requiting ended, however, a god has moved to oppose them, and again a war of mages and assassins has begun. No one can see to what end it serves, but already cities have burned for their ambition.

The Court has occupied itself recently with political matters in the realm of the living, so a resurgence of necromancers may be possible. But at the moment, only the most ambitious mages are trying their hand at the animation of corpses or the immortality of lichdom."
briannasaurusrex92,Parenting,1391023020.0,"I have this issue with a girl I sit for who just turned 9. She has pretty severe ADHD but I know she hears me somewhere in the back of her mind. It just doesn't register until its something she deems important. (I also have ADD, and I was raised by yeller/hitters, so I've had ideas for alternate discipline strategies for years.)

I just give her three chances to hear me, even in the morning before her pill kicks in, and if she doesn't tell me what she wants for breakfast I will pointedly say ""okay, I guess it's not important. You get whatever I feel like making."" And I follow through. That's the important part, that consequences follow, whatever consequences you deem proper for not listening to that particular request. A good one, if the request doesn't result in anything particularly pleasing (homework or some such) is that whatever she paid attention to instead of you, is now gone for five hours/rest of day/whatever time period, beginning after she finishes your request. That can be specific, like ""the book you're reading,"" or as general as all electronics if you feel her behavior was particularly inappropriate.

She has learned pretty quick that when she hears me say ""NAME."" (not loudly, definitely not screaming, just firmly, and followed by the question asked calmly and not grumpily), that means it's her last chance to pause what she's doing and listen, or else. I tell her and show her with my mood and actions how much easier things go when she listens, and honestly it puts her in a better mood and she's more accepting of further requests. I'm planning to decrease it to 2 chances soon, so I only have to ask her twice max, but honestly it's been so effective extending to every time period and situation that I don't mind sometimes having to ask two or three times, because so often it's only once. 

It may not work for your daughter, maybe you're already trying it, I don't know. And babysitting twice a week is certainly worlds different from being the primary caregiver. But I sit for them quite frequently, and have known them over a year, having started our relationship as their babysitter, not their friend, and the only time I have ever had to raise my voice was when she and her brother had both had an awful day and were setting up for a physical fight in the back of my car, so I thought at least I'd share and see if it helps anyone.

Edit: I think part of the reason this is different from yelling is because for parents who yell, that in and of itself is supposed to be the punishment. And they're wondering why it doesn't work, why they have to do it more often. And again from my experience being raised by yelling parents, it starts from often a tired or busy parent making a request and then not following up for whatever reason, and having that happen often. But then when you really need it done, you make sure the child does it, often by coming back and yelling at them for not doing it. And so it becomes not a punishment for the child, especially if you get into the habit before puberty -- it just seems like an escalation of the request. To the kid, asking vs. yelling is just like the difference between ""please could you"" and ""i really need it done!"". So since they don't want to do the thing, they wait until you tell them you really need it done. And you have to tell them you need it done every time.

So with the other punishment, the one where objectively unpleasant consequences happen and it's clearly a punishment, you're making it clear to the child that they've already gone too far by ignoring your request. They do have something of a desire to please you, so if the social boundaries are laid out early enough, it doesn't become a fight because of what is essentially a miscommunication."

&gt; Personally, leaving is something that sucks but also almost everyone has done. It doesn't happen that often and it is something you just have to move passed. Also it is more likely for a leaver to be on an enemy team, therefore it will all even out in the end. You will get your free win.

I used to think of the gym as a means to an end and just a bunch of random machines and exercises.  Now that I've been doing it for years and years, I have a much better appreciation for when somebody says they can bench press 200 lbs.  I am also more passionate about it.

Same has held up for music and programming, the two other big things in my life.

However, there's one caveat here.  You have to be willing to be identified as being passionate.  For example, I know some friends who vehemently nay-say the gym by saying things like, ""I just go and hope it's over soon"", or, ""I just want to be healthy I don't care about anything else at the gym.""  This kind of thinking is destructive for passion because there's no way these people will wake up one day and be passionate.  Their belief system that the gym is and will always be something to hate is holding them back from discovering passion in it."

in structural engr, the structures are very overbuilt by code and by design. this is for multiple reasons, the simplest being whatever you assumed when designing, your occupants/ end users will figure out a way to exceed.

furthermore, additional bracing that is just shoved in places and not really designed in can hurt a structures ability to take load or change the way it works and prevent the design (like a crush cage) from working correctly, which could ""weaken"" the design. think building a custom race frame in situ and just adding extra bracing or brace panels because you think more steel = more strength.

As an ECE, my advice to you is to be proud of Engineering pedigree and show it in your writing. Do not write like an excited 11 year old whose just discovered masturbation and is running to tell his pals.

Having said that, I should mention that a programmer's career there's no such thing as ""complete""; you learn new things all the time. You will brush against problems that require unique solutions which you'll find are easier to prototype in certain languages as compared to others in your tool set. The only way to learn this trade is to immerse yourself in it and stick with one tool-chain for a considerable amount of time. Increasing your exposure to the language and platform will increase the likelihood that you encounter strange and wonderful problems that really require you to scratch your head and pull on your beard.

Good luck at your new job."

Pipstydoo,changemyview,1391024384.0,"Right, but place all of this in the context of an economy which consists of industries that are *all* oligopolies, which use their power and money to elect legislators and judges who will either vote or rule in their favor.

The reason Obamacare was successfully defended in the Supreme Court is because it is an institutionalization of the HMO system within federal law.  It grows the number of consumers of health insurance by mandating [sic forcing] people to get private insurance or else.  It deepens the profits of an already ludicrously wealthy insurance industry.  It benefits the medical industry as a whole, because more people insured = more doctors visits = more pills prescribed and tests performed and equipment used = more profits.

The single payer option didn't make to legislation because it kills the profits of these conglomerates.  Expanding medicare to everyone didn't make it because it affects the bottom line of these mega-corporations.

The left/right paradigm is a myth, a fabrication.  Democrats and republicans are sides of the same party, which is the neoliberal party.  They work for corporate America, not in the interests of the people who vote.  

Remember this.  Voters only elect politicians technically.  Our political system isn't an outright tyranny, so people are *still* required to vote for the status quo to continue.  The reality, however, is the massive marketing campaigns funded by wealthy individuals and corporations determine any election.  The reason we even believe in the left/right paradigm at all is because these campaigns have so vociferously snuffed out the idea of a third, or a forth, or fifth party."

EvilMrGubGub,tall,1391024407.0,"I'm not entirely sure where this discussion is going, and to be honest I don't care I'm going to contribute to the original question posed regardless of whether or not it was proposed in a way that stimulates good discussion. I will be speaking strictly from personal experience. 

As far as my own personality is concerned, I'm the quiet shy type, that isn't necessarily nice all the time. Classifying me as a gentle giant would be correct maybe 80% of the time, but I definitely have my asshole moments where I'm simply not in the mood for any shit, regardless of who it's from. Growing up I was always the tallest, and that led to me being very self conscious of my height. Even today I still am, I dislike being tall. I wish I was shorter sometimes. My personality of that of an introvert, I don't normally enjoy being the center of attention, though in recent years I've learned quite well ways of being able to cope with it and carry on in those scenarios. It is very draining on my mentally and even physically. 

From my point of view being tall has definitely affected me, I had to try harder to make friends as a child, mainly because of a combination of being the tallest in the school and a nerd/geek/goober with glasses and a small speech impediment. My limbs have always waived around as they do on any tall lanky guy, thus I do my best to wear long sleeves when it's acceptable and comfortable. I have lower than average self confidence, so I wear the same clothing days on end not because I'm lazy but because It's the only thing I feel comfortable in wearing for fear of being made fun of. 

If I were to make up my own condition that is representational of the ""tall"" personality I would name it something along the lines of Magnavilistenera..or however that's actually supposed to go together in Latin. 

Magna - Tall, Vilis - Mean, Tenera - Gentle (I don't know how latin works I just stuck all this shit together and hoped it was right, which it probably isn't but shoot me)

Tall, for obvious reasons. Being 6""5' here may be commonplace (Which I fucking love!!) but for everyone else and the majority of the world it's a big fucking deal. Mean because, like I said I'm not always a nice person and I don't claim to be, though generally I'm a pleasure to be around and the first one willing to work through a problem. (Most of the time...). Gentle because, well the 20% of the time I'm not an asshole, which is lessening every day, I am the gentlest, kindest soul you'll ever have the pleasure of meeting. Except maybe Mother Teresa, Gandhi, or anyone else who is so undeniably good I can't dispute their standing (Although new evidence suggests Mother Teresa's status may be in Question, at least by some). How much of this stems from being tall? Hard to say exactly. 

Like I said earlier, I was always self conscious growing up, and those kinda of feelings regardless of what age they're felt will have an affect on your personality and actions. For me it resulted in years of silence that I spent simply wandering the confines of my mind. Nobody wanted to talk to me because I was the weirdo with glasses taller than everyone else, so I started talking to myself. Still do, a lot. (Don't worry, the voice is strictly my own, there's nobody else in my noggin trying to tell me what to do). My height probably intimidated a fair amount of kids on the playground, and as I found out later plenty of them hated me simply because I was taller than they were, but they also all knew me. It's this general knowledge of me that caught me off guard, even years later as people I have no recollection of ever meeting in school stop me and go, ""EvilMrGubGub! what's up bro long time no see, how have you been??"" My response? ""Who the fuck are you again?"" to which they always respond with something about how we had something to do with each other years ago and blah blah blah, you get what I'm trying to get across. 

Anyway, long ranty paragraph over. The characteristics of my condition are lowered self esteem due to growing up without many friends, due largely in fact to my height. Slightly increased mental capacity due to the simple fact that as a child I read and spent more time thinking than anything else, a byproduct of growing up without friends. I forged my neural pathways early, and am now in the process of unforging them with the help of my good friend internet. Also, a general awkwardness of being because I never cared for sports, mainly because everyone told me to and I was always the type of person to go against what everyone tells me simply for fear of being a follower. I doubt that particular point has anything to do with my height, but it wouldn't surprise me if a connection could be forged. My gentleness I will not attribute specifically to being tall, I was always a generally gentle boy, just with a mean streak in my head that I'm more than a little eager to fulfill. I used to pull the wings off butterfly's in the garden for fun, and I liked the powder that got on my fingers, but I cut that out after a year or so. (and hey catching butterfly's by their wings outside is a good exercise of your reaction times and speed). My meanstreak isn't really something I attribute specfically to my height either, everyone has a point where they're simply done for the day. Mine just tends to be a little less than most others, but I would imagine that how more to do with me being an introvert, and the fact that I'm never in a good mood when I'm tired or hungry. A lot of people aren't. 

So yea, Magnavilistenera is my condition and I'm damn proud to have it nowadays. Sure I can be a dick to people sometimes, everybody has their moments and generally the people I am have already overstepped their bounds. Don't worry, I almost always feel bad about it later. I do have a conscious, even if it's a little quieter sometimes. Being tall and what I've gone through being tall is what helped to make me me, and me isn't done changing yet. Nor will it ever be, and that's fine. More people need to learn, when it comes to being human and your personality nothing is 100% certain. People underestimate how deep a person runs, we are squares that only allow ourselves to feel a triangular version of ourselves. One factor cannot, and does not account for everything, but it can definitely help in shaping which parts a person feels. 

Totally off topic at the last part, but whatever. If you read the whole thing it won't kill you to read a little more. Just my .02 (or .10) cents. "

briannasaurusrex92,AdviceAnimals,1391024715.0,"Someone will say it's about a woman's right to have her own bodily freedom and whatnot. I totally agree that women should not be told what to do with their bodies by other people. I am staunchly pro-choice and consider myself a feminist.

But there is a huge difference between wanting to not have a baby (no, you shouldn't be forced to carry and birth a baby you don't want to bring into this world) and wanting to get high or drunk/tipsy (if you can't give up mind-altering substances for 9 months for the sake of a child you presumably care about, forgive me if I dont think you're suited to parenthood -- actually, don't, I don't need your forgiveness). 

Exceptions would be made for legitimate prescriptions of medical marijuana, as a mother who is stressed from being in pain will find it more difficult to care for herself and her child properly, but I see absolutely no reason anyone would put the health of their child at risk for a night of drink, however little they may actually ingest."
theoccassional,schizophrenia,1391024717.0,"She should be aware of your limits, anxieties, and outright fears and find ways to motivate and comfort you whilst working around them. The biggest part of this is you communicating openly and honestly with her. Try not to avoid a subject in conversations like these. Try to explain it thoroughly even if you feel (as I often do) that I can't explain it well. She will see that you are trying your best.If you are having a difficult time showing interest or intimacy, let her know that this is a hurdle for you. If you don't show these things and don't address their absence, it will appear to her that you are not feeling or willing to express yourself. Beware of becoming overly attached to co-dependent as the struggles that we deal with daily can be great stresses to those we share it with. Remember that she is there for support, not to be the medicine or therapist. In time, she will become more able to see when you are attempting to show intimacy in your own way. All people do this; this is not entirely am issue with blunting.A final bit: Keep trying when you feel you are not expressing yourself properly or fully. Don't let symptoms (especially negative symptoms) be a valid reason to be complacent. Dating and relationships as a social dynamic are based very much upon the value that the relationship is to the self. We want to date people that inspire us, motivate us, please us, make us happy, and these are largely selfish aspects of that social dynamic. As relationships mature, they become more complex and arguably less selfish in the aspects I just mentioned. However, there is no shortcut there and personal problems, however sucky it sounds, can't give us a bye.Hope these bits help you with perspective.

&gt;What a childish little faggot you are.

&gt;Lol. Win. 

&gt;&gt;You think that, just because the A symbol is upside down, that the **key upon which it is imprinted** doesn't move from ""the left"" of the S key to ""the right"" of the S **key***, when you rotate your keyboard?

&gt;I think the orientation adds to the specificity. That when we are specific enough, we see that, yes, there *are* absolute objective relations among objects in space and in time and that, further, these relations aren't mere whim or preference. 

By being specific, you're just being  specific. Not objective. Whether or not the keys are on one side or the other depends on which way you're looking. When you refer to a specific orientation, you're just being specific enough to be accurate.

&gt;&gt;Do you really think that? Because I'm looking at my keyboard and they *key* upon which the symbol A is imprinted is now to the right of the *key* upon which S is imprinted.

&gt;And yet, the keys are *still* oriented the same with regard to one another. You'd hait to take the keyboard apart to change that. But this would reinforce what *I'm arguing* rather than what you're arguing. 

Yes, the keys are ***next to*** one another. That hasn't changed and I have not said it has changed. But one key is now on the left when it was on the right. Get over it.

&gt;&gt;I mean, come on  now, you're an adult. You really think that's going to fly?

Then why is it I'm on the other side of the cars and the blue car is on the right? Which one of us is right? 

&gt;&gt;because all you have to do is go on the other side of the cars and that's not true.

&gt;The spatial relation of the car is not affected by your ~~ego~~ position. I know that's a hard pill to swallow. I mean, it would be if swallowing had any meaning. But since all spatial and  temporal relations are arbitrary, there is no such thing as swallowing. Or actually there is even though there isn't. This is what B-time is to you, after all. 

All spatial and temporal relations are dependent on perception. Not arbitrary.

&gt;&gt;When you say:

&gt;&gt;&gt; From one specific angle, the blue car is on the left of the red car

&gt;&gt;Then everything is peachy clean. Because that is true

&gt;Yay! And so given specific enough understanding, we see that there *is* absolute objective and spatial relations. Neato!

Only, no! That's just  specificity!

&gt;&gt;and this:

&gt;&gt;&gt; The blue car is objectively to the left of the red car

&gt;&gt;is false.

&gt;It isn't, though. Since, as noted, your position with respect to the cars does not change the spatial relation of the cars. I mean, I know that you think you're the center of the universe, but you just aren't. So sorry to break to to you :-/

***But what happens when my position to the cars does change!??!!*** That's what I've been getting at this entire time. Your perception of time and spacial relationships depends on your perception! What do you think I've been saying??

&gt;&gt;Yes, human beings objectively discovered that there is an axis of rotation and that one end of the Earth is on the other end from the Earth with Antarctica. Does that ***automatically make that point the North pole***? because Antarctica could be the North Pole and there wouldn't be any navigational problems.

&gt;This is a *labeling* thing for you? This is about the labels we put on things? You really think that? So if I call the North Pole the South Pole, automatically the world flips over. If I define left is right the cars magically switch places? The labels we give aren't important. But the spatial relation of thing A and thing B maintains until and unless one of the things moves with relation to each other. And the very fact that you and I both know what ""moves in relation to each other"" means, shows that there *is* an objective spatial relation. Of course you simultaneously do and do not reject this. That's because your conception of B-time is incoherent.

You clearly have misunderstood everything I've said. And your ego is unnecessarily inflated.

&gt;This'll be my last post on this subject until you answer my repeated question regarding the HH model.
 Scroll up to see what that is.

I don't see how this objection matters whatsoever. This is a red herring. Hence why I'm not paying attention to your pointless mewling."

This happens every day for homosexuals, they *are* widely reviled for being how they are. When we have this discussion, however, there's the assumption (i know i know) that the two folks in question homosexual vs pedophile *have or will* act on their impulses. There is no law against being attracted to children, afaik; but as a *human* with these driving impulses we assume that the person will eventually (or has) acted on these desires. Even if such action is ""merely"" to to accumulate and masturbate to child porn, those children were raped. It's a natural assumption that a human will act upon their core sexual urges in some way, carrying that thought to 'fruition' creates a stark separation: in one arena an adult consents, in another a child is raped. The villification of a pedophile in principle stems from this.

The year Punk was in Wrestlemania facing Jericho was he advertised as the main event even though he had the most important title? No, John Cena vs the Rock was. He is unhappy about this years Wrestlemania main event as well, he believed Daniel Bryan should be in the main event and that isnt only because Daniel is a friend, but it also is because Daniel and he are the unconventional types, they arent the biggest guys, they arent typical faces of a company, they both are wrestlers not freak shows so when he sees a guy like Daniel Bryan have an amazing year and still not be in the main event, that would make him lose confidence because whats the point of being the best if you arent getting anything out of it.

gingerkid1234,Judaism,1391025325.0,"The thing about it is that it's not *bad* regular English, in that non-Jews would use it too on occasion.  What the difference is is a tendency to prefer it--you put the object in front if it's the topic of the sentence.  Yiddish does it, too.  And Jews, in my experience, are OK with more complex sentences like that.  My favorite real-life example is ""the pastrami you put in the fridge I thought"", where ""the pastrami"" is out in front even though it's the object of the sentence.  Simpler examples are more common, but the more complicated ones are what I don't think you'd hear from non-Jews.

You need to go to therapy just as much as OP does. Your abusive parents may very well have given *you* a disorder. Just because you've rejected them doesn't mean they're not still controlling you from the inside. Indeed, becoming a ""bad person"" is just another way to fulfill their view of you.

It's pretty clear from your post that you think being violent is cool, and that you have pretty much no filter as to what's societally appropriate. It's also clear that you're aware that you're ""an antisocial asshole"". Why just accept that and live a lonely life, when you could get help and finally escape your parent's cycle of abuse?

Alduin the World Eater's role in the universe is to begin new Kalpas. A Kalpa is when history is reset to the beginning of time. History will play out in much the same way every time, but there will be differences; Some minute, some colossal. Alduin needs to keep the Godhead dreaming (Every single thing in the Elder Scrolls universe, with no exceptions, is merely the dream of a higher God figure).

This time around, the events leading to the next Kalpa were foretold by the Elder Scrolls - Fragments of Creation. The events of every game's main story are parts of the prophecy. The Warp in the West. The coming of the Nerevarine. The Oblivion Crisis. The Nord Civil War. When Alduin was banished into a time portal by ancient Nords using an Elder Scroll, all it did was transport Alduin to the time where his appearance would concede with the Prophecy.

The fact that Ulfric and the Last Dragonborn were at Helgen at the time is irrelevent. It was by lucky chance that Alduin flew directly towards it, the nearest human settlement, when he popped back into Mundus atop the Throat of the World."

These abstraction layers cost cycles in time and are therefore slower than native code, but mind you, not by much.

I suggest you go Java route (don't venture too deep into the land of interpreted lingo for your goal is to come back to C++) do stuff, learn the concept of how a game works by implementing it and then when you need to start shaving off milliseconds from your execution times, then come to C++ and start banging away."

Making contact with a pre-warp culture is different. They may not even have the desire to travel beyond their planet, and if a technologically superior race comes down to visit, it could unnerve many of them, possibly causing mass paranoia and panic, and in a worst case scenario, an uprising or dissolution of government entirely.

Then there's the sharing of technology.

But, and this is not a likely scenario at all, if NBC wanted to tack on a few more episodes and have them air before the finale (so, before the end of March) they could do that and there would be time, but it would have to be before the end of February.

Java is a great language to start, and C# improves on Java and addresses a lot of the short comings. Also C# is more like C++ than obj-c so it gets points there.

Unfortunately, I can't find any traffic data on the line from its early days.  But I can answer the second part!

Rail lines don't need to have two tracks (one in each direction) to be useable in both directions.  It helps, but isn't necessary.  What can be done instead is a system of [sidings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_loop) that allow for one train to pass another, on a brief stretch of double-track.  While this can slow things down (because the trains must wait for each other), it's capable of operating just fine in both directions without two tracks for the entire length.

&gt;Did they have places where a train could turn off from the main line and switch around?

Could you clarify what you're asking?  Train cars are generally bidirectional, so you don't need to turn the whole thing.  Locomotives in the US generally do have a particular direction they're designed to operate.  They can be turned using a [turntable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_turntable) or a track arrangement called a [wye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wye_(rail\)) or a [balloon loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_loop)."

JasonWaterfall,AskMen,1391027232.0,"It's not easy to find a partner for a bank robbery.
It is easy for many women (and some men) to find a partner to have nsa sex with.

So I think it comes down to the situation -- if the potential cheater wants to have sex with you specifically, but wouldn't cheat with someone else, or if they couldn't easily find someone else to cheat with, then you are causing more cheating to happen than would have without your participation.
But otherwise it doesn't make a difference.

In practice, though, I agree that it's almost always wrong, because since the cheater is actually trying to sleep with you instead of someone else, they obviously at least somewhat prefer sleeping with you to any alternatives.
It would be quite the coincidence if they were *exactly* indifferent between you and someone else and just chose you at random.

But on the other hand, there are degrees of wrongness, I think. 
If cheating would be a little less likely to occur if you didn't participate, doing so is less wrong than when it would be much less likely. "

PlushieChomby,relationships,1391027289.0,"Seriously, when I read that part, my head felt like it was spinning exorcist-style. 

OP, please break it off with her. You asked for advice on how to let her down or what to do. Have a conversation with her (preferably at a distance, like over the phone or net, where she isn't physically present because hot damn does she sound like she's got issues that might lead to physically extravagant ways of trying to prove her ""point"") where you bluntly tell her you think your friendship is bad for both of you. Don't sugarcoat it. Tell her she has a boyfriend, you'd like to date other girls, and the relationship the two of you have is unhealthy. When she starts crying about why, tell her that the possessive way in which she's treating you is wrong, and would be wrong, even if she didn't have a boyfriend. Quote her words back to her, about how she's the only girl you should need, blah blah blah. Tell her in *no uncertain terms* that it makes you feel incredibly uncomfortable to hear that from a friend, and that while you're sorry your friendship has to go this way, you don't see any other possible option for a future in which you both have a shot at happiness. 

If she threatens suicide, call her parents and tell them. Don't tell her you're going to call and tell them, **just call them and tell them**. She seriously sounds like she needs some professional help, and I doubt she's going to see that herself and pursue the help she needs, especially at her age. Her parents are the best shot at making that happen. It might sound intimidating, or like something you couldn't do, but please *please* consider doing so. Even if they don't stick her in therapy like they should, they'll probably have a talk with her, which will A) let her know her actions and words have consequences and flippantly threatening suicide will be taken seriously or B) make her not want to talk to you and share stuff on that level anymore, which is one step closer to extricating yourself from this incredibly toxic situation. If she truly is suicidal at 14, **her parents should know**. If she's faking for attention, **her parents should know**. Don't pass judgment or offer opinions, just tell them exactly what she said, or save the chat logs and offer to forward the screenshots to their email addresses if you go the online route. 

Lastly, I know how much it can suck cutting ties with someone in a small school, believe me. The private schools I was raised in often had between fifty and a hundred students *total* between junior high and high school combined, so anyone's business was everyone's business. The bottom line is that you're at an age where everything changes, and will continue to change for a long time. Don't spread rumours, but don't let her spread rumours either. If you're in the same space at any time, give her the cold shoulder. Any nicety will be viewed as an invitation to engage again, and I honestly think the best course of action for you would be going No Contact to the extent that you can. Even in a high school of fifty people I managed to cut a  few toxic presences out, former friends who'd far overstepped their bounds, like your friend has done. It wasn't fun, sure there was some fallout here and there, and I didn't handle it all as graciously as Adult Me would have, but you're allowed some leeway in your teens and in the long run it will be much better than letting this Stage Five Clinger dictate to you who you do and don't get to date/hang out with/see. 

If you need to vent further or ever again, please save my username and feel free to drop me a line. I'll be happy to listen and help where I can, or just listen if you need someone to talk to who's been there before but is much older. 

I can tell you without hesitation that if you don't stop it now, it won't get any better on it's own. People like that don't stop until they find a new target for their obsession, and that's likely a long time coming if it even *does* come. Best of luck to you either way, and please update us if you get the chance on how you've handled things and how they're going for you. :)"

Someone I know literally has family conference calls every morning, while others who have had a very rough time with their family situation would never fathom such a thing. For someone who values family very highly, that incompatibility due to differing histories and experiences might end up being a deal breaker for them. It's definitely on an individual basis--I know people estranged from their own family end up being lovingly accepted and almost adopted into their SO's family. If something like that happens, freecandysketch has a positive attitude just chalking it up simply due to incompatibility--it's not a reflection of you as a person.

A green flag might come from observing how well someone interacts with a person they supposedly care about (e.g. their parents). A red flag might be presented if for example their parents were very loving and giving, but that individual mistreated or didn't appreciate their family at all. On the other side, I'd even argue that it may be a different kind of red flag if someone *does* tolerate an abusive family situation."

Also you should know that the days when Ada was defacto languages of robotics and mission critical circuitry are no longer the same. I work on embedded robotics system for the oil and gas industry and we do not touch Ada, we use C++ and C everywhere. This is because they are tried and true languages, easily tightly optimized and we can get Intel on the line and have them issue patches for when the decompiled code doesn't fit our specification.

Good point about Fortran though, really a good language. Except calling out to everything written in C++ from fortran requires a but load of wrapper and that hopping around itself is waste of cycles.

&gt; lower budget games are coded in JITed 

As I said, Jit'd has brought optimization to a new level. Gone are the days when Java was a lumbering oaf (it still is when starting up). But when you write high performance code, you want as little wrappers between you and the OS/native libs, you want to manage your own memory and you usually want to avoid a big ol hunky VM sitting in the middle.

UglierThanMoe,AskReddit,1391028534.0,"Trying to play through any Halo game on mythic difficulty. Fellow Halo fans know what I mean.

For those who don't know, Halo games generally have four difficulty levels: easy, normal, heroic (i.e. hard), and legendary (very hard). Halo games also have so-called skulls, i.e. modifiers that change various gameplay mechanics such as only getting half the ammo when you pick up a weapon, your energy shields not recharging unless you hit an enemy with a melee attack, having to restart a level at the very beginning instead of the last checkpoint when you die, no HUD (no ammo counter, no reticle, no nothing), some weapons (usually those that you have to use the most) being utterly ineffective against energy shields of enemies, and so on. And mythic difficulty means playing through the game on legendary difficulty with ALL SKULLS ENABLED.

Aside from having to be *really* good in those games and Lady Luck smiling on you, you also have to know basically every little flaw and glitch in the game to exploit it. For example, one skull makes all enemies capable of throwing grenades throw them basically all the time instead of shooting. And the only reliable way to kill some of these enemies is to get close to them, wait until they start throwing another grenade, and then rushing up to them, getting behind them, and killing them with a melee attack to their back during their grenade-throwing animation. Easier said than done in confined spaces with other enemies also throwing grenades and shooting you.

It's completely unnecessary to complete a game on mythic difficulty; you get *nothing* for doing that (an exception is Halo 4, where you can unlock an emblem to put on your multiplayer character), and yet there's a rather considerable community among Halo players who do that just for kicks and bragging rights. I mean, kudos to those who succeed, but I'll never manage to pull that off."

selling each roll for 5-8 bucks netting me 8,000 bucks! Although with costs of sending them in taxes and all that jazz probly more like 5,000. But I don't live in the area and the shipping is too much even if I had the money. That's why local auction houses are so important.

It seems like it would be illegal to lie to the customer that you're providing them effective encryption while doing exactly the opposite.

Maybe the answer is to switch the customer to unencrypted e-mail.  You're forbidden from providing them the level of security they originally asked for, and you have a responsibility to tell them that, but you can't tell them why.

Or maybe  I should look up the French sentences because they were all lost on me. But I liked that, when Humbert Humbert slips into French it adds another tier to a character I never quite understood anyway. I laughed a lot more than I thought I would at it too. But also said ew a lot. And put it down once. 

No other book invokes physical reactions from me! (That I've read so far). It's just so well written. Despite this, when I was asked by the creative writing lecturer at a uni open day what my favourite book is I panicked and said Game of Thrones. Gah. It's *Lolita*.

Sighing I shake the blond frizzles away from my eyes before I turn the page of the daily newspaper. 
The coffee mug almost shows the bottom of itself when a frown appears on my forehead. Silently my lips form the words ""18 original copies from 1906 available"". 
Was this even possible?
With quickened heartbeat I drown the last gulp of coffee and decide to give it a try after work later this day...

...Entering the little antique book store my hand almost slips from the doorknob due to the sweaty film on my palms. I take a deep breathe and let my gaze wander over the packed bookshelves that cover the walls up to the ceiling. 
Somewhere in this room could it exist, reaching for me, trying to tell me the secret I've been eager to find out for all those years...
I steady my breathe and walk over to the empty counter at the side of the room almost tripping over my own feet. My hand carefully hits on the little bell sitting at the edge of the counter and I can hear slow and shuffling steps coming closer through the narrow hallway in front of me.
""Hello my dear"", says the old and fragile looking man to me while smiling open-heartedly at me, ""How may I help you?""
Returning his smile cautiously I quickly explain what I have come for. 
As a response his smile crackles and a glimpse of pity flashes in his eyes. ""I'm sorry"", he replies, ""but the thing you were looking for is sold out...""
I try to ignore the cold spreading in my belly, still thank him for his help and leave the store again taking a deep breathe on my way to the door. 
Entering the busy life on the street, my forearm scratches along the side of the doorframe getting me to curse loudless. After two more steps I ome to a stop looking at the tiny wound. 
Out of a habit I bring it up to my mouth and suck briefly at it, even though I always get told not to do so, to find it closing itself again when my gaze falls onto it the moment after. 
I sigh with a brief look over my shoulder into the book shop. 
How enlightening it would have been to finally read what my grand-grand-grand-father has written about our family secret. Before returning to my every-day-life, I realize suddenly that the storeowner is still staring at me absently frowning...

People have this idea that raids need to be loud group affairs.  I've raided almost exclusively solo, or in a two-man group, and been highly successful.

A proper raid is preparation and intel.  Know your enemy's movements. Know where he/she is weakest, both in patterns and in base structure.  Take enough materials for the job (another user on this sub mentioned taking 20% more C4 than he/she thought necessary, for example).  Know how to get in and out quickly.  

I tend to raid at dawn.

It really is that simple."

but lets look at it from the perspective of young impressionable people that want to start riding....be consistent...when mr.cool hero who smokes and rides a motorcyle gets on his bike have him strap the SOB on because helmets dont magically stay on your head when 50 mph wind is hitting that thing...

essentially i dont like that it gives the wrong impression about safety and no biker likes to see another biker down."

To me, visually, there's mainly two types of overweight women, those who carry their fat in their stomach and those who carry it in their ass and thighs. If your fat goes to your stomach then being overweight is like a death sentence for my attraction to you. If your fat goes to your lower half then I can work with that up to a certain point. To some extent it also depends on where the fat sits on your face, if it goes to your cheeks your face can still be attractive in a sort of babyfaced way. If it goes to your jowels, I'm not interested.

So basically when the fat distributes in a feminine way I can still find a girl attractive, if it doesn't then she stops being attractive."

You can minimize this by ""clean bulking"" but that's boring, and I like eating and don't care for my physique at all.

HabseligkeitDerLiebe,AskReddit,1391029860.0,"Don't get me wrong here.  
The corporations that sell GM seed right now are mostly chemical companies that recently (about 20 years ago) dabbed into breeding and not breeding companies with some history behind them. That's because the first traits that were commercialized were tolerances against herbizides, so you can use their brand herbizide on your field and only their brand crop would survive the treatment.  
(If done right this can actually reduce herbizide use.)

But these corporations still are chemical corporations (some of them even produced chemical weapons in the past) they traditionally don't care too much for the environment and do some sinister shit.

It's just that genetic engineering as a technology is neither good nor bad, like most technologies."

2. ""There is no amount that has been proven to be safe"" is a ridiculous way to frame it to begin with.

Basically in the way left of the blue you have the wall amounts. See how .00000014 has a higher amount of doge? that means a shitload of doge is ready to be bought at .00000014. No one is going to buy at .00000014 because the middle price .00000018 is where the current buy/sell fair price is at. Basically if the sells are spilling into the buys you will see a decrease in price because the supply is higher than the demand. It works the same way the other way.

For example, there was a stream I was listening to earlier (OCE vs paiN) where he was commenting on how boring the game was and how bored he was, etc.  It made it unpleasant for me to listen to; I like to listen while I work as I cannot watch.  So, by contrast, if you take Saintvicious - or other casters - they will often comment on what is going on and explaining how/why it's happening rather than complaining about the lack of action.  I understand that there is a dichotomy between an analyst/color caster and main/play-by-play style caster, but I would assume he could have been professional enough in his casting and experienced enough as a player (high Diamond, I think?) that he could have overcome his partners lack of insight by taking over the cast himself.  Instead he opted to explain how bored he was to a stream of 60K+ fans.

I have nothing against him personally, I actually watch his stream and saw him shave his head live, but professionally if this is the type of job he does while casting then I can understand why Riot parted ways."

GhostsofDogma,AskReddit,1391031641.0,"What? No. I'm saying that it's not a disorder or et cetera unless it detracts from your quality of life. That's literally what it says in the DSM. That's how you distinguish run of the mill l'appel du vide from something that indicates there is something wrong with you. Every disorder I can think of is distinguished from non-threatening normal human behavior like this, from pathological sadism to personality disorders. 

If someone was having legitimate suicidal ideation, schizophrenia, or tourettes, do you *seriously believe* that their life would not be negatively impacted by that on a daily basis?

My only goal with this was to help people, whom are notorious for self-diagnosing(I like it when tiles are lined up I must have OCD lol!!!) and then worrying about illnesses, by offering the basic test for pathology. I did not promote a treatment. I told OP that if it was impacting him negatively, yes, he should consider it abnormal and seek help.

I have been through this with thousands of times in no unspecific terms with numerous psychologists in order to determine my *own* safety and have even been held by a neurologist after mentioning the thoughts I was having until he could determine whether it was safe to allow me to leave- **Suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts are *not* the same thing.** OP specifically stated that he is not suicidal and could never imagine himself doing that. This is what distinguishes it from suicidal ideation. OP didn't show even a glimmer of actual want to commit suicide. It is true that my OCD makes it nearly impossible to stop those thoughts from repeating themselves over and over again until I can hardly function, but it is not true that ""intrusive thoughts"" do not happen outside of it. On the contrary, they are extremely common. OCD just amplifies these, it is not their origin.

To be suicidal, you have to agree with the thoughts on some level. You have to have intent. You have to consider it a serious option. Otherwise that just isn't how the brain works. OP indicated against having any of these."

Cyfun06,AdviceAnimals,1391031647.0,"To be fair, driving too slowly in poor weather can be just as bad as driving too fast.  Here in Montana, we're used to this shit.  Many times I've come upon some noob crawling along the fucking highway when there's barely a dusting of snow and the roads are pretty much clear.  I'm talking like 20mph in a 70 zone.  I then get people flying up behind me, having to jump on their brakes and almost rearending me.  If we try to pass the guy, we hit the little mound of snow in the middle of the road and start squirrelling about.

Yes, I know we've all been a snow noob at some point. But whenever you're in this position, just go out to the nearest empty parking lot and spend the afternoon sliding around and getting the feel for how your car handles on slick shit.  You'll learn both how not to go too fast, but how fast you can safely push it.

Edit: For those who think I'm full of shit, my point is that it's extremely important to go with the speed of traffic, especially in adverse conditions.  If you suck at winter driving and there's nobody around you, by all means, go 10mph.  But if you get a bunch of people on your ass, pull off to the side and let us by.  Then you can just follow   us and feel much more confident in these speeds if we're doing them ahead of you."

""Barry, 

I am not going to discuss this breakup further with you. I have no romantic or sexual attraction for you any more. After your reaction to the breakup, I have no social attraction to you whatsoever. So, to answer your question, this breakup means that I am not going to be associating with you in any way after this email. We are not friends. We do not have sex, at all, ever again. We do not call, text or email one another. We may say hello if we pass by one another in public but that is going to be the extent of our relationship from this moment on. 

There is nothing you can do to change this. I do not owe you an explanation, a second chance or any more of my time. I do not owe you anything. Please do not contact me after you read this email, I will not answer you.""

There's really no way to misinterpret this, other than willfully. Hopefully, he'll get the message.

Following that there is an Epic mission that you can begin after completing one of the tutorials called 'blood stained stars', commonly referred to as the Sisters Arc. Do that it gets you moving around and you pick up some good starting money.

While doing those things read up on different new player friendly groups. Eve Uni, RvB, Dreddit, Fweddit, and Brave Newbies are the ones I suggest you think about first. Worm Bros are also an option but you should probably wait a few weeks before trying a wormhole you need more skills for that.

Other thoughts:

Do not immediately go for bigger ships. They are not necessarily better for what you are doing at the time.

You are not your ship. Think of ships as expendable ammo and as a class in wow. Tackle frig is CC, Logistics is a healer. The thing is, you can fly either depending on the skills you choose to learn.

Until you know what you are buying, fancy faction ships and mods are a waste. Resist the temptation to gear up. Although Meta 3 and 4 stuff is quite reasonable to use. Named items costing millions more are not the same as a purple helm of a set if tier x raid gear..

Gl33m,AskReddit,1391032246.0,"There's a bell curve here, but a bell curve with a minimum limitation. If you take all the jobs in the world by pay grade and put them together you get jobs ranging from minimum wage to millions of dollars per year. But the fact that minimum wage exists is the lower bounds limitation. It is impossible (Theoretically, as I'm not saying it doesn't happen. It certainly does) for anyone to make below, we'll go with, $7.25.

Now let's look at who occupies the worst jobs. These jobs are the things that are hard, long work for absolute shit pay. Most of the people occupying these are men. Now let's look at the best jobs. Jobs like being the CEO of a major company. Most of these jobs are also occupied by men. But, there's no upper bounds set on those jobs. Their pay can literally go up and up and up as the economy rises. This means that the right end of the bell curve can continue to expand while the left end of the bell curve is locked into place.

Women tend to fall into the middle of the ""Job quality"" grid. They don't typically occupy the worst jobs (though some do, but far less than men). But they also don't usually occupy the best jobs (though, again, some do. It's just far less than men.) But thanks to that minimum wage cap, the middle area women are in still has a decent number of women working at or near the minimum wage line.

If you actually removed the lower bounds cap of minimum wage and kept setting pay based on job quality and skill level like is currently done, women's pay bell curve wouldn't move much, but the men's bell curve would shoot to the left. This would effectively have the top of the bell curve, the mean, sync up with the women's bell curve.

Or I could be completely wrong, and have no idea what I'm talking about. This is just the economic study I've read on it."

&gt;You should message me if

&gt;When people say they don't want to play games, they really mean they want others to play by their rules. I'm no different. Except I'm going to list my rules right up front. They are:

&gt;1. Due Diligence. I understand that you need to make sure I'm not a creeper, stalker, or 10 years older than I claim to be before sharing your personal information. Feel free to ask whatever you need to ask in order to feel comfortable. Asking questions is not being nosy. It is showing interest. And it is a pleasant break from the norm.

&gt;2. The One Step at a Time Process is: 1) Exchange messages here. 2) Exchange real emails. 3) Talk on the phone. 4) Quick date such as coffee or drinks. 5) A real date. 6) See what happens. At no time are you obligated to proceed to the next step. Step 5 does not imply sex.

&gt;3. No Email = No LTR. There's nothing wrong with texting, but as you've probably guessed by the length of this profile, I like to exchange full paragraphs too. If you want to win over my mind as well as my heart, you will need an email address that you actually use. Please type three complete sentences from time to time just to remind me you can.

&gt;4. ‘2b r not 2b?' Damn you Autocorrect! My clumsy fingers aren't cut out for texting. I might be able to type ‘on my way' or ‘5 minutes late.' But that is pushing my texting abilities. Please don't interpret short messages as me being curt. It just means I'm on a mobile device. This includes messages here on POF. I'm a charming MFer dammit. And it just doesn't come out in textual relationships.

&gt;5. Phone Calls. There is a dating rule for women that says, ""Don't call him and rarely return his calls."" Screw that! I'm old fashioned in some ways, but that isn't one of them. Your phone makes outgoing calls as well as mine.

&gt;6. A Go-Out Date Night for me is to meet at one of our houses, have drinks and leave for the restaurant together. I like to have a drink before leaving (but not to become impaired), and I like to ride together. For some reason, riding together is an important part of the experience.

&gt;7. Scheduling. I love being spontaneous. But if you're a working mother, or there is long distance involved, planning is important. If you don't like to plan, avoid me like a guy with a shirtless bathroom picture. (You're reading a numbered list on a dating profile for goodness sakes!).

&gt;8. Splenda Daddy. I'm hemorrhaging money. Divorce is not for the middle class. I drive a Honda and feel lucky to have it. I'm no knight in shining armor; more like a geek in tin foil.

&gt;9. I'll Call You Out On Your BS. I like honest people. One woman I dated for a while, on our first date, told me I was her fifth date that week. I respected her honesty. People who expect me to believe their bullsh*t do not earn my respect.

&gt;10. Discipline. I am lacking in it. For example, today was budgeted for revising the next chapter of my book. I wrote this crap instead.

&gt;For the woman brave enough to put up with my brutal honesty: I will make time to build memories with you and how you how much you are appreciated.

I like it because it helps me grow my business at a faster rate and although it may take 2-3 months for me to start to see that growth. It's worth the investment. The increase in minimum wage makes me more hesitant at doing this, because the wage increase decreases my margin of safety.

illaqueable,medicine,1391032759.0,"It is, no doubt, an incredibly challenging balancing act, and I am grateful that there are people out there who would make those kinds of sacrifices in the name of excellence; however, I think it is worth remembering that a successful, superlative surgical unit is not built by a surgeon alone. Top-notch support staff (including anesthesiology, nurses, PA's, etc.) can make or break a unit, and if those support staff are wantonly abused every time they make even the most trivial of mistakes, then the surgeon will eventually burn all bridges between him-/herself and the profession.

Of course, as with every issue, the counterpoint is that there are people in support staffs who *seek out* the kind of surgeon you've described, because they are excellent technicians (i.e. the surgeons), and will either take the abuse as part of the job or, in some cases, because they *actually want that kind of pressure and environment*. So the question I pose--and probably there's no answer--is: is it possible to eliminate the behavior without eliminating the excellence? Or, perhaps more to the point, is it possible to eliminate this sort of behavior from every area of medicine?"

That said, I think RP guys have sort of painted themselves into a corner, where they only allow themselves to date manipulative, immature, over-dramatic women who are high-maintenance.

&gt; According to the Hartle–Hawking proposal, the universe has no origin as we would understand it: the universe was a singularity in both space and time, pre-Big Bang. Thus, the Hartle–Hawking state universe has no beginning, but it is not the steady state universe of Hoyle; it simply has no initial boundaries in time nor space.

[In this post you said the HH Model eliminates the singularity](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1wakbl/rda_153_malak_cosmological_argument/cf1opo6)

Which is patently false, as you can see from my copypasta from Wikipedia, which I absolutely trust over you.

Furthermore, in that same post you suggest that the HH model conflicts with the Big Bang model, failing to notice that the HH model models the state of the universe before the Big Bang. Which shows you know not of which you speak.

MisterScalawag,loseit,1391033226.0,"I never said you won't make progress or gain strength during that short of time period. But gaining physical muscle is a long and hard process, especially women. 

Men can at most (without steroids) gain 5-10 pounds of muscle in a year of working out. And that is depending on genetics and how strict a person is. With good genetics and a strict diet, working out probably 5 or more times a week that person could reach 10 pounds a year. Many casual guys who lift weights don't actually realize they can only gain 5-10 pounds a year, so then they will make claims like I gained 25 pounds of muscle in a year. No...they actually gained some muscle and then fat also with it.


Then there is the additional problem that women take longer and don't build as much muscle as guys do, although I am not familiar with specific numbers on females. I would imagine a safe guess is that it would be somewhere in the range of 1-5 pounds of muscle a year for females. With 5 being the person with great genetics and a strict diet.


Now then think about how much you would gain in 30-40 days if you can only gain 1-5 pounds a year? There will probably be little physical difference in muscle gain, but you will feel stronger and more confident leading you to think that there is a large change in appearance. "

If she's cool with it, you're in the clear to start setting boundaries like that you don't always feel like talking about how your day went and you'd rather keep things super casual. 

Just please don't go the scumbag route and start lying, now that you know what you want. In time things can change and then you can address them if they do, but if they don't, at least for now you're pretty clear on what you want with her. "

Lennon was completely contained and anonymous on the right.

however, i was very impressed with our set pieces....looks like we actually took time to practice them for the first time in 4-5 years.

Liked the fact that the team kept fighting after they went down, would have been easy to completely close up shop but they kept fighting, didn't lead to anything but was much more than we had shown in the previous meeting against city.

The environmental factors are much larger than the chemical factors on children. Children aren't stupid. They're very keen at picking up indicators from parents. Parents have an expectation that kids will get hyper from candy consumption, and that expectation is often expressed directly to kids, and discussed with other parents within a child's perception range. Parents also typically limit candy consumption, and it's used as a ""treat"" for kids. These factors are all far more vital in affecting child behavior than the chemical changes sugar consumption causes.

PlushieChomby,relationships,1391034949.0,"I'm going to assume this is all real and you're not a red pill nutjob trying to gauge a false women vs. men slant in this subreddit like I've seen happen before. 

So break it off. The mentality of those, regardless of sex, who believe that women hitting men is okay but vice versa is not is *just* as dangerous as idiots who believe the ""two lefts make a right amirite guys?"" bullshit I see on reddit. Self-defense is acceptable by any sex, but if you can avoid it by breaking it off before it becomes a necessary quotient, **by all means do so**. Don't wait until she hits you or brings it up again; simply sit her down and tell her you believe the two of you are on different wavelengths and would be better off finding more compatible partners. If things happened as you said and you aren't embellishing, it's just better to get out now and not look back, not take phone calls, not try to stay friends, because in the long run you may very well regret it. She has to learn sometime that that's not an okay way to think, but you don't have to be her life lesson or teacher. Plenty of women understand that hitting anyone outside of self defense is *not* okay regardless of sex, and believe in taking responsibility for one's own actions. 

I watched my little brother date someone who believed that, and on a night when she lost her fragile mind and attacked him, she choked herself out and punched herself repeatedly when he wouldn't hit her back right before she called the cops. If not for him having deep scratch marks on his face, arms and body and showing them the sheer amount of meds she hadn't been taking but should've, they might have believed the bruises forming on her body came from him. **You don't want to be in that situation or anything like it, and while the possibility based solely on those two incidents is unlikely it still exists in theory, so do yourself a favor and get out now.** "

I've been trying to improve my stories with a lot of sensory information or thought information and for some reason it's difficult for me to pass a thought or a description without falling into a sentence like ""The X was Y."" I suppose that comes from practice and discovering new ways to include descriptive qualities into something more akin to a thought or an action rather than a narration.

&gt; noun

&gt;noun: singularity

1.
the state, fact, quality, or condition of being singular.

""he believed in the singularity of all cultures""
synonyms:	uniqueness, distinctiveness 

More

a peculiarity or odd trait.

2.
a point at which a function takes an infinite value, esp. in space-time when matter is infinitely dense, as at the center of a black hole.

Nothing about an ""initial bound"" of anything.

That's just google though, let me see what Webster says:

&gt; :  something that is singular: as

a :  a separate unit
b :  unusual or distinctive manner or behavior :  peculiarity

2:  the quality or state of being singular

3:  a point at which the derivative of a given function of a complex variable does not exist but every neighborhood of which contains points for which the derivative does exist

4:  a point or region of infinite mass density at which space and time are infinitely distorted by gravitational forces and which is held to be the final state of matter falling into a black hole


Still nothing about initial bounds of any variable, let alone space and time.

What about Oxford?

&gt; the state, fact, quality, or condition of being singular:
he believed in the singularity of all cultures

When it's just you, alone, the ability to change things for the better is 100% yours. You can embark on any number of possibilities; it's the most basic starting point.

We get into relationships to soothe the desire for companionship from another human being. So, when you *physically* have that other human being but do not *feel* that other human being even being there, it is just as bad as being alone with the added caveats of...

--Knowing that your partner is just as unhappy (and this can wear on your own self-esteem)

--Having the inevitable breakup looming and needing to be dealt with/executed

To look at it another way: think of it in terms of coffee. You want a nice, piping hot, flavorful coffee and all of the great feelings that come with it.

You go to the store and, after a bunch of work, you wind up with: flat, stale, flavor-less decaf that has the taste of mud.

Wouldn't it be better to rid yourself of that unsatisfying coffee and place yourself back into a position where good coffee can be attained?"

POGtastic,AskReddit,1391035962.0,"Military here.

1. You would have a large group of very, very angry troops. There's about a million soldiers, active and reserve, who would probably protest quite vigorously, not to mention all of the veterans who would also be incensed. The typical response to this (chain of command bringing the hammer down on malcontents) would be useless, as the chain of command would also probably be with them. Keep in mind that the military's small arms just by themselves would whoop the fuck out of any riot police. Oh, and said protestors would be united, disciplined, and willing to fight.

2. Our allies, especially the ones who cut back on their own military forces as part of agreements with us, would be very angry. Israel would do perfectly fine, but Korea and Japan would be scared shitless.

3. Taiwan would be very quickly conquered by China.

4. The Middle East would probably get much worse. Even though we're winding down the wars there, we're still providing a lot of logistical support, technological expertise, and training. That would go bye-bye.

5. Most defense contractors would go out of business.

6. We would cut back on the deficit, but not as much as you might think.

Other than that, you have a few other things that might qualify as ""military."" For example, pensions to retired soldiers. Disability payments to wounded veterans. Benefits for dependents. Would those be cut off as well?

Edit: Yes, I would probably be with them, if only because it's fucking retarded. Do what they're doing right now - wind down the military by downsizing, forcing people out, and stopping promotions. Gradually back out of our military agreements with other countries. But putting a million people out of work along with their families with nothing but a kick in the ass is a bad idea.

By multiplying d into the parentheses in (1), the equation is expanded.

    a = a*b + c*d - a*d

We can group the two terms with *a*. This will help see how we can eliminate *a*, since (2) does not include *a*.

    a = (a*b - a*d) + c*d
    a = a(b - d) + c*d
    a = -a(d - b) + c*d

The problem is for maximum strength you need ~1"" overlap of the fibers depending on the fiber-resin bond strength. This might work if they are laying it out as one tow coated in resin but you run into problems with any sharp corners, the carbon won't lay down nice. Vacuum bagging with a near complete vacuum the tightest you can get is ~1/8"" with most pre-pregs, generally you don't go below 1/4"" because fibers start breaking and you can start to lose strength. 

The alternative to using tows is short chopped strands in the extruded cord but obviously you won't get anywhere near the strength of well laid up carbon fibers."

Our government and it's members need to learn their place, be humble and recognize the honor it is to serve the people.

Third, I won't defame Democrats as a whole for the few on this thread who consider this action to be something we as Republicans would condone.

Got my girlfriend hooked on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which is a step up from the average TV shows she's watching usually.

Been studying the Shadowrun sourcebook to join a friend's game in a few days. Made a character and everything! I'm warned it's a little like doing taxes, but I've played EVE and Warhammer 40k, so spreadsheets and tremendous amounts of d6s aren't new to me.

Thanks Obama!) when he got thrown into the sea, and now that he's back and will be probably even *more* stressed, I predict some explosions in the future. I've got *my* popcorn ready, how about you?

 One thing that is bothering is how it seems like the writers have forgotten about Manaka. I don't remember any character making even a mention of her, let alone spending some thinking about her still being downstairs in the Aquadome. You'd think Hikari would be torn up a little more about not seeing her, but, well. 

*The Pilot's Love Song* - No one saw that coming, huh? :P Nope, not a single person. Nada. Zip.

*Golden Time 16* - Ghost Banri is still a little bitch. Fuck him. However, it was great seeing a really genuine, heartfelt romantic moment between Banri and Kouko...which only further divorces the idea that Banri is internally conflicted over who he loves from reality.

*Nisekoi 3* - Ok, so, apparently Shaft is doing a much better job of adapting this than I thought. I mean, it's still pretty generic harem misunderstandings, but it looks like Shaft has managed to improve the pacing from the manga, making it such that it's actually not even bad. In a rare turn of events, I actually prefer the *anime* to the manga. Weird stuff.

*Sekai Seifuku 3* - It actually took me a bit to realize exactly what happened at the end. I was so distracted by the camp and the ludicrious subject matter to even realize that *Kate was actually, legitimately evil.* Not ""lol evil"" like Team Rocket, no, Zvezda are *legitimately* extremists who ruin humanity. Holy fucking shit. 

*Nobunagun 4* - This show still hits a lot of generic shounen beats, but it twists things *just* enough to be interesting. Like before, she had to rely upon her inner Nobunaga to pull out her potential, because she herself was too freaked out to concentrate. That sequence where Nobunaga called for his drum, had Shio dance and then *freaking jumping out of a plane in a hurricane* was balls-to-the-walls awesome. I don't know if this'll be my favorite of the season, but it's gearing up to be one of the best.

* Having a nice sense of humor. Don't get upset at terse jokes, and make them back. It's a nice battle of wits.
* Initiating sex a lot... gotta say, that IS attractive. 
* Adding to the above: a girl who isn't indecisive. You're a person--control your life with decisions. Don't expect me to make them for you.
* A slight hint of perfume. Just enough to smell when you get close by.
* Wants to join in on your daily affairs. E.g. video games, playing sports with friends, reading... even if it's just as a spectator. It shows us that you show interest in us. We notice.
* Invites you to her things, even if you're not interested. If you're out to get clothes, attend a yoga class, dance class, watch a movie, or anything else. Even if we say no (or act insulted that you'd invite us), the thought is appreciated. Some of us even say yes.

Throwing out cases when they disagree with the law? 

""The defendant probably hit his wife.... But bitches be crazy. Case dismissed!""

EDIT:I'm collecting a lot of downvotes because this ""is in no way comparable""

Why is this? because you condone one and not the other? I'm not against marijuana use, but the judge was clearly bribed. But that's not even the point.

What if it were the other way around? What if a US judge gave prison time for public intoxication for the simple reason of disliking alcohol? I doubt anyone would defend that, or respect the judge for putting personal conviction above the law. But this is Reddit, and the circlejerk is strong. This judge made a pro-marijuana decision and therefore must be a brilliant and honest judge. Any user who questions the pro-marijuana judge is an ignoramus and must be downvoted.

dusmeyedin,DoesAnybodyElse,1391037980.0,"I think there's a difference between nostalgia, which I understand to be a general recollection of the past - often fondly - versus what I think the OP is asking. My take on OP's question is that it focuses on extremely vivid emotional reactions to a song based purely on contemporary life events.

I get nostalgia when I hear a song from my general childhood. But when I hear ""We are young"" and it sends me into a panic about being broke, soon-to-be-jobless, and wrestling over a professionally unethical order my boss gave me, that's a different category of mental association from simple nostalgia.

Same goes for when I hear ""Just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in"" and it brings me emotionally right back to my depression about picking up an internet stalker who threatened my friends and family.

Or when I listen to ""Call me Mr. Vain"" and I'm once again a preteen kid left to live on his own in a foreign country after his parents were recalled to a different continent.

None of these associations are vague or enjoyable - which I consider to be the hallmarks of nostalgia as I understand the term. I think there's a much deeper mental process at work linking audible triggers to traumatic past events.

I don't know if others have this deep, usually-negative association with music. I do occasionally get the shallower, more general, vague positive nostalgia feelings and to me they are not very similar."

They aren't allowed to date. I forget what they call it (courtship sounds right but I think they had another name), but in ""dating"" they have to always be in the company of someone else of the same sex, their dates being supervised with each other and allowing no contact whatsoever between different sexes. From what locals have said, it isn't uncommon for girls there to become pregnant or get in nasty situations when they get a little brave and go drinking for the first time. Many of them grew up extremely sheltered and leave the place having never really made big decisions for themselves. They have curfews and restrictions on what they can do or watch or listen to at all times. Failing to abide by these rules results in expulsion. These policies favor the men. A couple at the school got pregnant; the guy got a slap on the wrist and the girl was expelled.

I don't think so, it's not like these Senators were receiving any additional funding for being Liberal.

That being said, apparently some of the senators have had quite the extensive history with the Liberal party, and as such may not appreciate this gesture.

With regards to the current generation of Liberals, I can't imagine this will do much. The Liberals and Conservatives are entrenched along party lines, I don't think they'll vote very differently for the time being. However, in 10 years, who know's. Perhaps we'll have a senate that resembles the ""sober second thought"" they were supposed to be in the first place.

Aprikoat,summonerschool,1391038896.0,"1- I like those junglers best so I often just pick Udyr into them because he's got the ability to deal with all of them and pressure them back. However, since Naut is my other main, I typically deal with high pressure early junglers by warding the everloving shit out of my jungle, starting red, and hitting 4 asap so I can be relevant as well. (Sidenote: Naut actually has a lot of kill potential on his own level 4-onwards if you catch a squishy at around 1/2 health or so)

2- Depends. Honestly, sometimes you only show up in a lane to ease some pressure off even if you know you can't get a kill, just to help your laner farm. I go for a kill if I can, but a burned flash is a successful gank in my books.

3- Snowball a winning lane. Too often have I tried to help a completely incompetent lane only to spend all my time there getting nothing while our winning lanes lost their advantage because I was never there to help them/it let me get counterjungled. If one of your laners is absolute garbage and you can't salvage it, cut your losses, tell them to do their best to not die and keep their fed opponent in that lane, and then go help someone that's winning or going even.

4- I don't understand. Are you talking about if one of your lanes has high kill pressure or if they do?

If yours, their jongler will probably want to show up there to slap them and keep them from snowballing, so keeping tabs on their movements is always useful. Sure, give them a kill if you can and help them get ahead.
If theirs, you want to keep them from snowballing so if you can then yes kill them if they overextend. It's really annoying to do this against people like lebonk though so just easing some pressure off is enough if you can manage it. If they have someone weak early like ahri or veigar you can straight up bully them and even take their turret before level 6 just to completely screw them over before they even get a chance to be useful. Beware the counterganks in both instances.

winged_venus,TwoXChromosomes,1391039497.0,"This doesn't sound harmless.  Imagine if a man were saying them to a woman!  This is clearly abuse.

Unfortunately, one of the men's important social issues, is that if they are abused, they are seen as somehow 'deserving it'.  You see this with your co-workers asking her what her boyfriend did that he had to send flowers.  Men have it tough, because there are NO resources for them in most cities and areas if they are abused.  Men have even been turned away from women's shelters, of course.  

Also unfortunately, there is really nothing you can do.  If you manage to get some literature that is not all about women as victims, you might sneak it to him if you ever get to see him, or mail it anonymously.  That's the most you can do, I think.  But be aware, if she ever finds that he has it, it could go a lot worse for him.

If you knew she was striking him, and he had marks, you could call police.  but they'd need a lot more evidence to arrest a woman for domestic violence than a man...because juries would need more to give a guilty verdict on a female abuser.  

No, its not acceptable.  It's abuse.  Whether a man does it or a woman, its abuse.  the sad fact is, there are resources for abused women, and people take women victims seriously.  this poor man is liable to get shrugged at by cops, sneered at by his family for being 'whipped', laughed at by other women, etc.  And everyone else will just think he did something to deserve being abused.  He must have cheated on her or something, right?  And people in Twox, think...well its not going to be as bad as if it was a woman victim.  They make judgements that women victims deserve more help than men victims.  

Ask around about why there are so few resources for abused men, and then get active in issues that are for real equality, so that NO one, of either sex, has to be in this lonely, unsupported position without any help available.  And to have society see it is 'unimportant'.  Nobody will help him, nobody cares, there is no men's shelters, so what would he do--where would he go, even if he wanted to change it?  "

There are many variables and you and your friends are nowhere near qualified to determine what affects your health in what ways. Put your trust in huge cohort studies that are specifically designed to identify cause and effect.

On top of how a vaccine affects your own health, the secondary (one can argue more important) function is herd immunity. By not getting your child vaccinated you put others with weakened immune systems, like cancer patients, at increased risk for severe illness.

biffysmalls,SquaredCircle,1391039662.0,"So your solution is to go back in time and put Bryan in the Rumble and win it?

I have an even simpler solution, using what they have to work with at the moment.

Turn Vince babyface.

Vince says that The Authority was in no position to offer Batista a contract without Board approval, of which he is Chairman. The Authority also did not get Pennsylvania athletic commission approval for Billy Gunn and Road Dogg to wrestle, as officially they were there as non-wrestling producers.

Batista is stripped of his title shot. NAO is stripped of the tag belts.

Vince orders a match between the last two legitimate guys in the Rumble: Reigns and Sheamus, where Reigns goes over and wins the title shot at WM.

A Tag Title match is also ordered between the former champions, The Rhodes Bros and the #1 Contenders: The Real Americans. The Real Americans go over when Goldie turns on Cody.

Batista is incensed and cuts a heelish promo, where he aligns himself with The Authority and sets up a match at EC with Bryan. Vince then adds the stip that the winner of that match will be the Third Entrant into the Triple Threat match for the WWEWHC at WM XXX. Bryan goes over Batista at EC, Bryan pins Orton (not Reigns) at WM for the belt.

The rest of the card:

Cena vs. Sandow (it can be built up well in six weeks)

Wyatt vs. Sheamus

Lesnar vs. Undertaker

Real Americans vs. The Usos

Ambrose vs. Big E (unification)

Rollins vs. Ziggler"

I see it often that women have to be worth staying after the sex happens but wouldn't that inevitably lead to a large number of partners? I do agree that withholding sex will lead to frustration but I feel that waiting at least allows a woman to see if a guy shares the same interest for her. So I disagree that a woman is trying to undermine an alpha by waiting to have sex. The gray areas lies with how long is it worth to wait on someone. A few dates or weeks may be reasonable for some, but I think if you're the kind of girl who has sex on the first date you'll have trouble finding commitment. "

After I have sex, I just go pee. The semen comes out then. I've never needed to ""push"" it out, and I suspect they do it that way in porn because it's graphically arousing for the audience?

For me, sitting on the toilet + gravity + peeing has always been enough. But if she feels the need to push it out, she can, it's not gonna hurt her... nor is keeping it inside if she falls asleep right afterwards for instance. It will eventually come out.

morebanjo,AskReddit,1391040117.0,"I do enjoy when the people of Reddit are articulate, intelligent, and respectful - and it does happen. I have learnt many new things from Reddit and had my perspective changed more times than I can remember - something for which I am very grateful.  It's wonderful how Reddit can connect so many people with similar interests that might otherwise have never found such friends (given geography, or social atmosphere of real life or whatever)

I have also experienced the callous side of Reddit users. There are some subreddits in which I rarely comment for fear of unrelenting personal attacks and belittlement.  I understand that some issues carry with them sensitive emotions for some people. I can understand how a person would abandon their otherwise reasoned and respectful nature and attempt to personally hurt someone with a dissenting opinion.  There have been multiple nights when I couldn't sleep because I couldn't get over what someone said to me and how much effort they expended (judged by length of post) to discredit me and my opinion using fallacies such as personal attack, hypocrisy, false dichotomy and the like.

I believe that this kind of negative, malicious speech against dissenting opinions is, in large part, facilitated by the anonymity of reddit.  For some people, this ability to blink in and out of existence (by getting and/or deleting user names) allows the person (person, not user) to inflict emotional harm on people with virtually no risk of retribution.  However, there are benefits to anonymity - it allows a person to reinvent themselves in ways they would never have tried. It allows people to try on new identities that real life wouldn't take kindly to. A few positive examples of identity reinvention are: sexual orientation identity (am I gay,straight,bi,pan??), nerd identity (how can I connect with other people who are into nerdy things without fear of being judged by my current peers as a nerd).  

There are may positive examples of why this anonymity is important and valuable. With all its positive attributes, it also comes with negative ones such as the ability of a person to try on a newer, more nefarious identity.

That's my experience.  Does anyone share this experience?"

I think INFJs (or atleast me, obviously can't speak for everyone) want to do more than we are physically capable of. I want to push myself and do everything I want (work hard in school, see my friends as much as possible, get a job) and I can't and it frequently frustrates me.

I've spent 15 years of gaming playing only 3 different games... counter strike, then WoW, now LoL. And it's all the same. At first CS was amazing... but as the game got more and more popular, the community got worse and worse. Started playing WoW. It was amazing for awhile, but as the game got more popular and more mature, the community got worse and worse. Now I'm playing LoL, and the same pattern is repeating.

This is a problem that is WAY bigger than LoL... and complaining about it within the context of the ""LoL community"" is, well, sort of pointless. "

Maybe she included Federal Pensions into that. 

Oh no - that doesn't even begin to touch on the problem.

While the numbers differ a bit based on when they were calculated and what is included, [this is a more accurate number on our debt.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/23/does-the-united-states-have-128-trillion-in-unfunded-liabilities/)

Not a single finger wag from TNT, though I've been given warnings for other stupid, perfectly asinine shit over the years (mostly a word or something in messages, when I forgot the site is basically designed for small, naive children rather than adults.) Sometimes on a minor scale, where items were priced below 100 NP but limited in a way where I could easily see them being worth over 1,000 NP (and buying them out made that happen), sometimes just in a ""these are going to seriously appreciate over time"" way where I'd buy hundreds of items, store them in my SDB, and check SW years later to find they were now at thousands or tens of thousands of NPs or even unbuyable through SW. 

So it's by far not cheating, it's not breaking any rules, it's just another way of potentially earning more NP, though I have zero interest now in the level of effort it took to do that sort of thing. "

However, come visit Montana sometime. We have roads that are dead straight and stretch on into oblivion, where you're lucky to see another car once an hour, let alone wildlife or pedestrians.  Plus, driving even 40mph still means it'll take TWICE as long to get to your destination.  That means that you'll be on the road that much longer, and the more time you're on the road, the more likely you are to have an accident.  It's a double-edged sword.

Another big issue is that sometimes speed is in fact your friend.  A few years back, it was pretty icy out, and I was coming up to a big hill in town, driving my old Trans Am.  A guy in a 4x4 was ahead of me, but going pretty slow.  I slowly accelerated up to about 40mph before I got to it, and then eased off the throttle.  Half way up, he started spinning out and swerved toward my lane.  I, having built up enough speed, was just about to pass him, and had to swerve into the oncoming lane to avoid him.  But I made it up the hill fine, and just in time to look in my mirror and see him eating a curb."

3. Feminist so that you cant call them out on their bullshit.

Hooning in a parking lot is perfectly legal if you have permission or the owners don't care.  It's a helluva lot safer than learning to drive there than on public streets.  And you won't damage anything if you avoid parking lots with bloody curbs and light poles.

Yes, in an ideal world, there would be driving courses offered in every city at an affordable rate.  But there aren't, so we have to make do with what we've got.

What really helped for me was trying my hardest to maintain a little bit of a social life outside of school and finding allies within our class. Do everything you can to maintain your mental health. If you have to study 8-10 hours on a certain day, you owe yourself a cocktail/beer at the bar. If you finished that one intense assignment, you give yourself 30 minutes to watch an episode of your favorite show- and so on and so forth. Above all, guard and protect your mental health. If you feel you should see a therapist, DO IT. If you feel you need to take a night off, DO IT. If you feel like you want to go to bed early, DO IT. What I have found is that I am far more productive when I feel well rested and socially connected with others.

It was the first campaign and we (the players) were all pretty bloodthirsty at the time. So the story calls for us to raid this Kobold dungeon and so we go off to do that.

Kill the patrolling guards at the mouth of the cave, but realize: the cave is full of traps! those little kobold bastards, with their ingenuity!

so, we light a fire at the mouth of the cave and blow all the smoke into the cave to smoke them out.

well, after about 2 minutes of rolling to make sure it all goes off like we want it to, the entire cave system of Kobolds, 50-75 of them, run out of the mouth of the cave, completely defenseless.

We're talking women, children, elderly. 

The DM of our campaign told us that we could roll attacks of opportunity in what amounted to an ""open season"" on those poor little bastards.

I was originally a self-taught musician and so are all my friends. We all had fun and thought we were amazing. We were okay at best. Then I went to music school and wasn't just taught how to play, but, more importantly, how to *practice*. I immediately excelled into an actual musician, and most of my friends are unfortunately kind of a pain to play with now because of their inability to play consistently and focus.

My point? You could plug away if you really wanted to and slowly absorb the concepts over years and years of casual playing, maybe memorize some fingerings with muscle memory, and become a piano player. But you will hit a plateau without fundamentals. Scales, inversions, theory, ear training, and sight-reading all serve a purpose, and there's a reason why these things are taught at the professional level. Together, the pieces solidify into actual musicianship. Without them you will always be lacking; not to say that there aren't many ways to learn the fundamentals without formal training. 

Start small and try to enjoy the simple stuff. Patience is a virtue. I highly suggest finding an instructor who received formal training themselves, or at least reading through some books and truly internalizing every bit of every concept. At least take a few lessons and ask specifically *how to practice efficiently*. Your skill will slowly accelerate that way and your chances of playing the music you want will be much, much higher.

Then go back and actually read my post, because I actually laid out why you're the one ""bikeshedding"" (this is the most stupid term, btw). Let's take it from the top: thing is named. Group says name makes them feel unwelcome. Cue shitstorm over why thing's name is sacrosanct (as opposed to, you know, its functionality). Deep, deep in a thread, I suggest, ""Por que no change the name but keep everything else the same?"" Receive toddler-esque rant that goes something something I've got a dick (so do I, sweetie, it doesn't make you special). And despite the tantrum-throwing and the woe-is-me-ing and the not-actually-proving-your-point-ing, your position is secured because there are enough misguided dunderheads on this site to back you up.

I think that about covers it.

I mean, it's not like this hasn't happened before. Racist sports team names? Racist place names (Re:Niggerhead)? And when the subject of changing it came up, we got the same bullshit: boohoo muh clever puns, boohoo muh traditions, DON'T YOU TOUCH MY IDEA-BABY! But then the world is like, ""Nah, fuck that,"" and the name gets changed, and the sky doesn't fall, and things actually get BETTER because the inclusivity brought about by NOT having a stupidly-exclusive name means more sharing of ideas which means better solutions which is basically the whole fucking point of being a human being.

But you'd rather have shitty puns than knowledgable partners who just happen to look different than yourself. Kay.

Btw, you are indeed sexist. The most insidious kind, actually: the one we can't throw into the slammer because your misbehavior is carried out behind a computer screen, doing as much damage as any wolf-whistle but practically (though not morally) negated by your general usefulness as an educated worker.

you could've been going 5-10mph slower than warranted and this guy had to go 15-20mph faster to pass you, which put him over what the conditions could actually tolerate and spin out of control. also, the act of overtaking is inherently unstable due to acceleration and lateral movement - perhaps it was that, rather than the actual straight-line speed, that caused him to spin out of control.

I think the idea was originally they were going to bring the Republican Party back to its roots, then that they were going to take it over from within.

The problem with separating is that our political system is rigged for two parties, by mutual consent of the Republicans and Democrats.  If you don't get at least 4% of the vote in a Presidential election, you can't get Federal matching funds in the next one, for example.

It doesn't help that both of the existing parties are working against them, with the collusion of the mainstream media.

While much of the Republican base has similar ideals to the Tea Party, they need more time to consolidate support - but they may eventually go third party."

I asked them about the replacement carto's  and I also got the extender , which is nice since it lets me use any 510 device, but also kinda mutes the point of it being such a small device.  any carto you get needs to be at lest 45mm long though unless you have the extender.
 any 45 mm non-flanged cartos should fit . the BOGE ones they suggested when I asked seem to work OK, but are not my preference. for whatever reason the smoktech ones seem to work better for me. 




 If you do purchase, I would suggest going ahead and ordering two unless you get the kit, then order 1 kit, and one of just the gripper since they are only $7 right now. and also be careful to not try and screw your carto ( or the extender if you get it ) in too tightly. I haven't had any issues because I am careful, but I do recall reading  where a few people have ""stripped"" the inside threading by trying to screw in cartos too tightly.




 I love mine and I hope you do as well. compared to my mech mods and VV/VW devices it is  smaller and lighter and great to just toss in my pocket and not worry about anything. it's a great little stealth vape and on the cheap!

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1391044382.0,"I think you misunderstood the 5% statistic.  It's not that 5% of PEOPLE are gay, but that 5% of men are gay.  So 5% remains 5%.  

I'd tried to get my husband (who is a bi guy) to respond but he was like ""ugh I have WORK to do and stuff"" but I discussed this briefly with him, but he mentioned a study in which men who are interested in men are as high as 20-30% of the population.  Again, a big chunk of that would include closeted guys who have girlfriends or wives i.e. not relationship material, but overall I think you're selling your potential dating pool short.  Also my husband was like ""What?  Denver has a pretty good gay scene!""  I don't know what he's basing that out of, he's never been to Denver.  I have, once last June, and all I know is you crazy motherfuckers have a governor who brews beer from bull testicles. 

If you want my (totally unsolicited) advice, I think looking for gay men who ID as poly is misguided.  Polyamory is largely a straight movement.  There is a huge percentage of gay men who structure relationships in non-monogamous ways that are essentially poly, but they're not gonna CALL themselves polyamory because they're not part of that movement.  Gay dudes have been practicing advanced non-monogamy way before straight people even considered it!  It just seems there's a lot less labeling around it.

I don't think you have to be a burner (god forbid!  the best time of the year in SF was when burning man was on and those assholes left the city) or into BDSM to find guys into dating someone who has a boyfriend.  I think you will just be better off framing it as ""I have a serious relationship, we're open, I'm looking for another romantic connection with the right guy"".  That might make more sense within that culture than stating ""polyamory"".  Also consider hookup sites like ManHunt?  I know they're hookup based and I'm assuming you're looking for a more romantic connection, but based on my husband's experiences, plenty of guys use ManHunt, Grindr, etc as dating sites too .  Sure, the guys on there might be looking for casual sex, but that doesn't mean they're not open to more.

Hope this doesn't come off as lecture-y.  My husband has had zero luck finding guys on OKC either."

Tokyocheesesteak,news,1391044405.0,"&gt; Around 2:30 A.M., there was a commotion on the dance floor.

Grimm was “carrying on like a madman,” Williams said. “He’s screaming, ‘I’m gonna fuckin’ kill him.’ So I said to him, ‘Who are you?’ He put the gun back in his waist and said, ‘I’m a fucking F.B.I. agent, ain’t nobody gonna threaten me.’ ”
(Grimm, as noted in the article, denied having made the statement, saying, “I don’t need to speak that way. A guy with a gun who knows how to use it doesn’t need to say anything.”)

PlushieChomby,relationships,1391044478.0,"Seriously, advice for your situation doesn't really get better than what /u/goingtonagoya said. Do you enjoy living under his thumb? Being forced to put up with his unwanted presence on social media and your phone? It certainly doesn't sound like you do, and I can really only see three ways this will go: 

* You reply to one message and one message only, telling him to fuck off, that you're not interested in him as a friend, lover or anything else, and that if he contacts you again, you're going to involve the police regarding his harassment and get a restraining order. He may show up at your door; obviously don't answer, just call the cops and let them deal with the situation, give your statement, and be prepared to pursue a restraining order if he's a psycho who doesn't let up. Far better than ending up dead or beaten in an ICU. If you know or feel strongly he's on his way over, have your own strong friend come over and keep you company. My roommate keeps a loaded Glock on the off chance some asshole ever breaks down the door looking to hurt either of us, and thankfully we live in a state with strong castle doctrine to protect us in the unlikely event that ever happens. I'd imagine a dude you know with a baseball bat or frying pan could be almost as intimidating and take down your asshole ex before he caused you physical harm. Just a thought to consider if you're seriously in fear for your life at the thought of him showing up. 

* Continue ignoring him. Put up with the ridiculous amount of contact he's putting in and naively hope he gets the picture and goes away. Months or years from now, he may find someone else to focus that insanity on, and maybe by then your spirit won't be so beaten down and your psyche won't be so damaged you can pursue a meaningful relationship with someone else after a few years of therapy and trust building exercises. 

* Tell him via text to back the fuck off or you're going to the police for his harassing behavior. Tell him if he shows up, you'll have him carted off to jail and his life will be forever tainted by an arrest record. He has some semblance of intelligence, accepts that even if he has a strong desire to have you back, that desire is outweighed by the desire to not have his future jobs/relationships/whatevers tainted by an arrest record he's brought on himself, and he backs off to either work on becoming a decent human being or find another more willing victim. 

I wouldn't count on the latter, though it'd be lovely if it worked. I've seen it work, thrice that I can currently remember, where an overzealous asshole lost his steam at mention of the police, called my friend(s) a bunch of names, and disappeared to focus on a new, more obsequious victim. Even once had to utilize the police myself on a former suitor, where I got a cop friend to call and tell him in no uncertain terms that what he was doing was against the law and if he kept it up he was going to find himself on the wrong side of prison bars. Never heard from him again, thankfully. 

If you go with option one, make that your only message. Don't contact him again after explicitly telling him via provable text (courts love hard evidence but hate reneggers) that you will not be in touch again and that any further contact will be considered by you as harassment and blatant disregard of your wishes and well-being, and that every single attempt at making contact will be reported to and filed with the police. Then follow through. Call the cops if need be. File a report if he shows up. If he doesn't show up but keeps calling and texting and messaging, call the cops anyway, explain your situation and ask if one of them can give him a call to warn him of the dangers of his behavior. Sometimes all it takes for an idiot to see they're being an idiot is an authority figure getting involved. He'll either be so scared or so disgusted/angry with you for involving them, he'll write you off, if he has any sense of self-preservation at all. 

If you go with option two, God help you, because your ex won't. Doing nothing is pretty much the worst thing you can do for yourself in this situation. If you think it's just a matter of time before he stops, I'll say this: I've thought that, too. I've even seen and experienced it. When I was younger and more afraid, less sure of myself and the law, I let some guys harass me until they tired themselves out. By the time it was over, I was worn down each time and had to take a long hiatus from dating or interacting with men to stabilize and readjust my mind to realize not all men are creepy, self-centered bastards. A friend of mine, who is 34, is not so lucky. She broke up with an asshole when she was **24** and he **still** sends her messages, sometimes abusive sometimes wistful but always something she doesn't want to see, a whole fucking decade later. He's married, he has kids, she told his wife once who screamed at her and called her a fucking lying whore... And the next week at work she got a bouquet of flowers from him and a vague apology with a vague signature. She won't go to the cops, no matter how much I and others have plead with her, and he won't fucking stop. I'm not saying your jerk is like this, as I believe that kind of insane asshole to be a rarity amongst humans, but rather to illustrate via anecdotal experience the sheer length of time through which some people refuse to let go, despite other life events being ones that *should* have redirected their energies. 

Please protect yourself, OP. Your ex is an immature dumbass who doesn't deserve months more of your life devoted to avoiding him. "

MotoCasey,AskWomen,1391044831.0,"I'm not exactly sure what a RPW would be, and given some of the descriptions below of the redpill sub I don't agree that women should be used in such ways, however I definitely have a more traditional view of gender roles.

For example: I think women should know how to cook. All women. This does not mean I think it is necessary for a woman to cook for a man every single meal, but I do think it is important for women to be able to cook, not only to feed themselves, but, in all likelihood, they will be the ones cooking for their husband and/or family. 

I also think women will do most of the cleaning around the home. Again, that doesn't mean I think men shouldn't clean up after themselves, but in reality it is more likely to be the woman who vacuums and does the dishes and sweeps. 

Along the same lines I think men should be able to do traditional man things. My toilet is leaking? He should know how to fix it. I need my oil changed? He should be able to do it for me. 

Basically, it is the woman helping out the man (feeding, cleaning, etc) and the man helping out the women (maintenance, etc). Each partner helps the other. So I don't see any of this as a bad thing.

I should also mention I come from a small town, and in my own family this is the example for every single member (parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, everyone). So certainly in my little world it is the norm, and as far as I can gather in most other places this is still true as well."

Biologically it makes sense.  Two people come together, like each other, and your bodies are saying ""Let's make a baby!""  But even with two HLs, when that wears off it can be disconcerting or even relationship-ending without the emotional connection.

Athol Kay of MMSL claims there's a slut in every woman, but his only sexual experience is with ONE woman, his wife, who happens to have a giant slutty and submissive streak.  That's great for him, and informs all his advice, but obviously doesn't apply to all women.  There's plenty who are HL who have no interest in being submissive, and there are plenty who just don't have an inner slut and no amount of ""game"" can change that.  

""Marry a slut"" isn't helpful advice to people in long term relationships , but jesus, I wish more people would consider it before getting married and had having kids.

fiveifrenzy6,SelfDrivingCars,1391045405.0,"Exactly, I was only providing a concern I had about what this technology will bring with it.  Which is that you are no longer the only one who can control your car at all times. 

&gt;Why are we you even speculating the vulnerability of system that hasn't even been released yet? Why wouldn't you think that there is a stout system of security implemented at all levels?

I wasn't really, I was just thinking ahead a bit and sharing some thoughts until I was met with someone who thought it would be impossible. So I tried to show that it is very possible. I was only trying to help them understand by sharing my knowledge in security but they seemed to continually think I was wrong. I definitely think that there will be great security measures in place because of the damage that could be done if it wasn't.  The extent that I was going to prove my viewpoint was because of the repetitive comments that showed they didn't understand what they were talking about. 

I would also like to mention that some hardware produced in china (and elsewhere) has been proven to have malware installed at the factory level (think HDD coming with things on sectors that appear corrupt or empty with nowrite markers that actually have code stored there). This was mainly so that the possibility of them being used in government computers would grant them access. So I would hope that these cars' systems are produced somewhere trustworthy or we could have issues even though security measures are in place. 

Again, my knowledge is in security and risk analysis/management so these are things that I think about on a regular basis. These are the things that are important when I am working with new technology that can cause me serious damage or put me at risk. I am only sharing my knowledge and opinion on the subject. I don't see why I am getting such a large push back from a technology community. I would have thought this would be a concern to people dealing with this stuff on a regular basis. "

Cyfun06,AdviceAnimals,1391045516.0,"My point is that we're extremely used to driving fast in all conditions, so those that impede the flow of traffic due to their own lack of confidence are a bigger danger.  You're correct, nobody should be going faster than they can see, but requiring people to constantly speed up and slow down or pass you just adds to the likelihood of a problem.

This has been a widely debated topic.  For the amount of time that you do X, you are Y likely to have a problem.  So if you decrease the amount of time you do X, it will decrease Y.  However, if you have to hurry to do X faster, at what point does the fact that you're hurrying cause more problems than it prevents.

Not sure how you confused an ATV with a Trans Am, but my point was that going slower isn't always safer than going faster, and that keeping your speed up is important in many low-traction situations, just ask any offroader.  I've gotten stuck many times because the dumbfuck in front of me went too slow for me to keep my speed up.

I agree with you though, I slow down per the road conditions.  My point simply that slow drivers can be as bad as fast drivers, no matter what the conditions."

I have like zero patience with myself in terms of my musical ability, so of course I had issues with patience.  My advice is to relax, take a break from playing when you have these things taken care of (I would ask the doc for a time table), don't cheat, and then take it slow when you start playing again.

One of the things that people don't seem to realize is that farming takes up most of the water consumption in California. They're subsidized to the point that they spend only a couple of dollars per thousand gallons of water.  The government can end those subsidies. Of course, this will drive a lot of farmers out of business.

Barring that, water will just become more inconvenient. Water will be trucked in, and people will pay lots of money for it. In addition, people will be much more careful about how they use it, as it will be much more expensive.

Subsidizing water is what is causing this imminent shortage. Get rid of the subsidy, let the price rise, and people's behavior will adjust accordingly."

The exhaust stream has three major ""components"" if you will, that energy can be extracted from:

* Kinetic energy in the form of velocity and mass
* Potential energy in the form of pressure and volumetric flow rate
* Thermal energy in the form of temperature and  specific heat

All three of these things are highly dependent upon each other, and all three are reduced as the exhaust flows through the turbo. A very significant amount of the energy is transported to the turbine in the form of heat. Why else would all the engine manufacturers go through the trouble of putting quite heavy and complex heat shields around the exhaust manifolds that didn't exist on the V8s?"

Hid out in an old farmhouse WAY outside Atlanta. Took the brunt of the radiation from the nuclear blast too. Just kidding, even though my skin doesn't show it, I holed up in the farmer's bunker below it. Nice fellow, let me in and fed me. Fed me a lot, so much that I began to get fat. Very fat. Large enough to fit into the cauldron the farmer had going in the corner. 

So I bashed the fucker's head in and headed towards the farmhouse. It was semi-intact, but what remained wasn't worth taking. 

Except for the double-barreled shotgun. Carried it for a couple miles, until I found a small town named Catur, in (from what I could tell by the maps, used to be the capital state of the Southern Commonwealth, Alabama. Catur was about a three hours drive away from Alabama's capital city, Montgomery. Took me a week to get there, almost died of radiation poisoning and malnourishment. Thank God for that Nat. Guard contingent. Poor bastards were already dead, but their gear was still viable. 

So, I donned their armor, and headed North. Went up through Birmingham, became an unwilling grunt in the War on Discrimination Because of Radiation in the New Ghoul Army (though, at that point, I didn't know what the hell they were talking about, thinking I was a ghoul. Oh well, hindsight is always 20/20.) and fought up until I was near the Northern part of the state. I jumped ship, deserted, and traitored to the 3rd cause: whatever you called it, I got the hell out of there.

So, now you may be wondering how I managed not to stay feral after scavenging for years in the ruins of Birmingham and Huntsville? A Rad-X/RadAway/Buffout cocktail does the trick, and I've never seen anyone else do it. So hand me said cocktail, or else I'll end up going Feral on your ass"

But let's say I didn't directly try and do something to the person. Let's say I'm driving a car, and I know every time I get in a car something might happen where I hit someone. I'd do things I could to prevent hitting someone. But in the event that accident happened, I don't believe I'm at fault to the point where I would be required to have that blood transfusion.

Man, the collection I had, and it breaks my heart that they're all gone. Well I do have one packed away in a box somewhere. I think it was called ""[Quicksilver ~~Delivery~~](http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mw9USaPappt1xPWGZYOqqgg.jpg)"" (found it) or something like that. I also have the interior of a 68 Camaro I built for a contest in the 8th grade. I put so much work into it, then I heard that the main judge was into old cars. Slapped together a 32 Dusenburg, hardly even painted it at all. It beat my Camaro. I was pissed. I tossed the trophy. The detail I put into that Camaro. There was a pair of nunchucks hanging from the mirror with a tiny bag of herb and a couple tiny joints on the console. That's the interior that I still have. 

I don't build any more but I still love to see what people do in this sub and a couple others. When I was little I used to go to the Puyallup Fair every year and my favorite part was all the dioramas that were in a back corner of some building. It was truly inspiring work."

Starting with eugnics, although it is true that the worst of defects lead to spontaneous abortions, not all defects are genetic; many are due to the health of one or both parents or decisions made while the embryo/fetus develops, e.g. maternal cocaine use, diabetes, etc.  Also, many of these defects are not passed down either because they are not hereditary or because these individuals cannot reproduce or choose not to, etc.  From a more down to earth, dollars-and-cents perspective, (edited... let's just say these babies can be expensive).  At least with things that do not affect a person's ability to live a nearly normal life, e.g. the limb thing, I do not feel this is something inherently worthy of avoiding through abortion.  In the same way, a soldier returning from war without a limb is no less a person.  Last, but not least (and this point is rather pro-lifey (and disclaimer, I do find myself on the pro-choice side of the debate), but), there is some inherent value to a human fetus, or embryo, too, as a stage of development of a human being, a potential human being."

t0talnonsense,MensRights,1391046948.0,"You can't deny the patriarchy as a societal description, which is what it was intended to be. You can't deny that for the majority of human history, men have dominated leadership roles and subjugated women. This patriarchal society is what has led to the majority of gender inequality **on both sides.** The patriarchy created the dominant, non-feeling, manly man, just as it created the soft-spoken, supple, subservient. 

The problems arose when militant, anti-men, feminists started getting the term into the modern debate. It's easy to tell young, impressionable, girls that the patriarchy caused all of the problems. 

From there, the thought process goes like this: 

* patriarchy=cause of women's plight 
* patriarchy=men
* men=cause of women's plight. 
* man hatred

Where what should really be occurring is:

* patriarchy=cause of women's plight
* patriarchy=male dominated society
* change society and empower women

There is a substantial difference between what the real definition of patriarchy logically implies, and what it has been turned into. 


Edit: my point is that there are two very different definitions to the term patriarchy. One is beneficial to understanding women's rights issues, while the other is against gender equality. Implying that it's a bad thing to believe in the patriarchy dismisses the societal definition entirely, and further perpetuates the problem. Rather than dismissing, MRA's should educate. Being an angry and dismissive MRA comes across the same way angry and dismissive femi-nazis do. "

AgentMullWork,Bitcoin,1391047229.0,"I am concerned about global warming, to get that out of the way. I haven't seen any of the math behind bitcoin's energy consumption that I actually agree with. I'll do a little back of the envelope math. Lets assume the whole bitcoin network is run on older ASIC technology that has been superseded by more efficient hardware, like a 330mh/s USB block erupter. I'm sure there's a lot of regular CPUs still mining, maybe malware that hasn't been noticed yet, and some might still be GPU mining, but they're the exception at this point.  
  
To run the whole network on erupters, you would need about 130MW of power. That is a huge amount of energy compared to anything we deal with on a daily basis, but its very small on the global scale. A coal or nuclear power plant put out 100-4,000+MW. The hoover dam puts out 2,000MW. The Three Gorges dam puts out a staggering 22,000 MW. The Emma Maersk, a cargo ship, puts out 120MW, and its powered by the largest combustion engine in the world, not a mix of nuclear/hydro/solar/renewable with the coal and gas. This is an oversimplification since its based on power, not emissions, and ignores plant efficiencies, but Bitcoin is a drop in the bucket of everything in the world. If the network was run entirely on the latest generation of ASICs you'd only need 31MW, so we're already getting much more efficient and reducing the future power consumption of the network. Older devices will become unprofitable and be taken off line."

I'm actually happy with most of that piece (I may end up rewriting one chord to make it sound less Renaissance-esque, but that's a minor change).

I'm now mostly out at work. Last week we were all sitting around and somehow our conversation wondered to a topic that I had to explain to a fellow coworker, essentially outing myself. Everything has gone well and everyone is incredibly accepting—not that I expected any other reaction.

Speaking of work, I've been asked to provide a campus-wide training on calculator use and techniques to all of the tutors and lab assistants at my university. I'm simultaneously nervous and excited. But it feels awesome because according to my boss ""[I'm] the most qualified and knowledgeable person to talk about every model of calculator known to mankind and their uses"" ( a bit of exaggeration). There will probably be around 100-125 people attending this training, so it's kind of new territory for me.

Also, I finally came out to one of my closest friends (to whom I was worried about coming out). I slipped it into conversation (which he caught), and he was completely accepting of it. Apparently, my love of musical theatre and opera gave me away to him—I don't deny it.

So, the last two weeks have been awesome for me!"

it's certainly less safe for the cyclist. i hope this should be clear. and for the drivers-- it's dangerous enough already *without* these cyclists on the road behaving erratically that you have to avoid hitting. it increases what you have to be aware of on the road, and already many drivers struggle with road awareness without bikers.

so-- how is it safer for cyclists to ride on the road? and you better not pull out some irrelevant statistic again."

&gt; In the Scriptures, 40 is used as a symbolic number.  It is the number which represents a long period of time during which something of great significance is accomplished.  In the time of Noah, God caused a great flood by making it to rain for 40 days and 40 nights.  After leaving Egypt, the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness for 40 years.  After being Baptized, Christ fasted for 40 days. Jesus ascended to heaven 40 days after resurrection. According to Orthodox custom, a woman is excused from attending public worship for 40 days after giving birth. Thus it is that 40 days signals the end of a period of mourning, and we mark the occasion by remembering our departed and praying God for their souls.

On a related, and very unfortunate note, tomorrow I will be attending a 40 day memorial for my three year old Godnephew (sister's Godson) that was murdered right before Christmas last year. Rest in peace, little buddy."

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1391047973.0,"I should clarify - I'm the author.  Pimping my own blog, I'm shameless.  I actually starting this piece as a post specifically just for DB, but my husband convinced me to make it a blog post  instead.  

The use of ""sluts"" in tongue in cheek after reading way too much manosphere hatred of sluts - by admittedly lonely guys who wanted to be in a relationship! It struck me as bizarre.  If even a fraction of those guys manage to meet and marry the near-virgin the wanted, I just saw them posting on DB a few years later, wondering what went wrong.  In my mind, nothing would have ""gone wrong"" - they got the exact result they should expect by excluding ""promiscious"" women from their dating pool.  

Everyone is allowed to have preferences in who they want to date, obviously, I just think that marrying a ""virgin/prude"" with the idea that they will magically become a ""slut"" after marriage is a strategy that makes for miserable men.

But relating to what you've written here: in general I agree.  There are so many components to what makes for satisfying sex for couples in LTRs.  There's the physical ""am I getting off"" aspect, the natural baseline of libido in general, the emotional component, the more rational mental component - there's just so many factors at play at any given time.  

I think introducing poly/open relationships/swinging is generally a bad idea for DBs, which already tend to come with a lot of resentment and often poor communication, but in a healthy situation but the sexual charge one gets is pretty intoxicating   At least for us, it was kind of like being back in the throes of NRE.  There's a clear biological component to this, but a mental one as well.  Unfortunately when there's already the resentment and crappy sexual communication that usually accompanies a DB, the downsides of serious emotional jealousy and more resentment tend to way outweigh any potential benefits.

Ultimately, the only way to fix ""fixable"" DBs that don't exist based on an obvious medical issue, SSRIs/HBC, recent childbirth, etc, would mean that the LL has to change the fundamental way they think about sex.  I think this is possible, but rare.  The LL has to want to do so, and has to put in a lot of emotional ""work"" to do so.  And the results may never be up to the standards the HL wants, but I don't think most LL's are actually asexual, fundamentally.  Those that have shown the capacity to enjoy sex probably could again, the question is, do they want to enough to figure out how?

* http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node28.html

Edit: Don't think about it terms of the turbine being heated by the hot gas. Think of how the other physical properties of the gas are affected by the change in thermal energy across the turbine. To maximize efficiency, it works out that you want the inlet gas to be as hot as possible. Typically the upper limit here is based on material properties, which is why companies have invested huge amounts of money into casting turbine wheels out of fancy materials.

keypuncher,askaconservative,1391048495.0,"&gt; If the debt was actually that high then the economy would collapse completely and we would be in a full blown depression. Since it hasn't and we aren't.

You are failing to understand the difference between current debt and unfunded liabilities.

Imagine you have an unmarried son with no children, and you borrow $10,000 from him, and sign a contract saying you will pay him back the $10,000 when he turns 21 - and not only will you pay him $10,000, you will pay all of his children $10,000 when they turn 21.  Having spent the $10,000, you don't actually have any money at this point.  Your actual debt at this point is $10,000, and your unfunded future liability is $10,000 x 0.

Your son now goes out and knocks up a bunch of women, 10 of whom decide to keep the children.  Your unfunded liability is now 10,000 x 10 = $100,000.  It isn't debt because it isn't money you borrowed - but it *will eventually* be debt, once it comes due if you can't pay.

If you don't take steps to come up with $100k over the next 21 years, you are going to find yourself $100k in debt (more if he has additional children in the interim).

This is the position the US is in.  The US has promised to pay a lot of people a lot of money, and it is not taking steps to actually come up with that money in the interim.  When those debts come due, there will be no money to pay them.

My own troop had very serious maturity requirements in place in order to advance in rank. They did this through the leadership requirement; if you weren't mature, you didn't get a billet, and you didn't get to advance. This meant that the average Life Scout was 16 years old with the occasional exceptional 15-year-old. It also meant that there were some First Class scouts who were 16 years old and had forty merit badges.

We were a really, really good troop. No bullying, genuine mentoring, and adult involvement that guided but didn't micromanage. From what I've heard, it's still a good troop today. We didn't have many Eagles, though.

I still think that it's a better model than the troops where the adults run everything and everyone gets Eagle."

IAmNotAPerson6,AskReddit,1391049193.0,"Sorry to shamelessly piggyback on the top response to get more views, but your comment is actually relevant to what I was going to say to, so...

One of Chomsky's major points with the propaganda model is that it isn't even mostly ""blatant and apparent and even on-purpose."" Just the way the media are structured makes it highly distort the output. Just recognizing the cursory information like what filters there are (ownership, funding, sourcing, flak, anti-terrorism) really shows how systemic it is.

Which brings us to another point: That it's not a conspiracy theory. It's not theorizing about people conspiring together to do something maliciously. In fact, it argues against that. It argues that just through how things are set up, who gets in what positions and how they think, and stuff like that, there will be extreme distortions, bias, manufacturing of propaganda, and the like. It argues that, at least most of the time, the people that produce the news aren't consciously aware that they're making propaganda; they just think they're making the news.

Obviously though, there are loads of instances like the one you give, where people are actually aware of what's going on. Which makes it a hell of a lot worse."

Lluxx,actuallesbians,1391049486.0,"/r/awesomesauce00's and /r/code-sloth's links are a good start, I'd definitely give them a look. Generally, if it's technique you want to learn about, fingering and oral sex are probably the thing you want to start with (look them up if you want, or feel free to ask questions and I'll do my best to answer them). As for general advice:

**Communication.** Don't be afraid to tell her that you're new to all this and would appreciate some guidance; it'll show her you're enthusiastic and care about pleasing her as well as helping you out, so win-win. Also, don't be afraid to ask questions or what she likes for the same reasons above. Finally, don't be afraid to tell her if you're enjoying something or it's uncomfortable - everybody likes different things and it's hard to know what people want or don't want unless you voice it. 

**Enthusiasm.** Take the initiative, even if you're nervous. Don't be afraid to show how you're feeling and just generally seem excited. Having sex with someone who seems bored or tired is pretty disheartening, but on the flipside it's incredibly sexy when the other person makes it obvious how into it they are. 

**Safety.** This is definitely something you should look up, but I'll give some general advice. Essentially, even though there is a smaller risk of passing infections along when it's just two vaginas, it is possible. HPV and herpes are infectious without symptoms and oral sex can also serve as a means of passing it. My general rule of thumb is regular STI tests, no oral sex with people I don't know very well and don't touch anything that looks like it could have an infection. Other people may feel differently about that; latex gloves and dental dams are other means of protection, but even those aren't 100% foolproof. This kind of ties in with communication, but don't be afraid to ask your partner if they've been tested recently. Some people worry it'll be perceived as insulting or unsexy, but if you feel doubtful it's best to have your mind put to rest. 

Best of luck to you, I hope your first time is great!"

As for the SP question, I found I usually here strange sounds, I can't feel my body at all, sometimes it feels like I'm laying on a brick, and always I hear a loud or faint crash. Sometimes I feel like I'm being watched but that's very rare for me. 

It sounds like you were close to SP by my own personal experience as I usually feel that before I SP. I hope I answered all your questions. One more thing, I've found that SSILD and sometimes WILD lead me into FA's (False Awakenings) which is just where you are in your room but you are dreaming, usually my room is bigger and there is extra tables and the furniture is rearranged.

So your attempt is to teach them to do the opposite? All this will do is incentivize the parents to force their kids to do well in school by bribing them with the money they are being bribed with. ""Hey Johnny, If you get all A's you can get that cool $100 toy you wanted. Mamma wants $100 in new shoes"". Not only that you are showing these kids that parents are going to be paid for doing what they should already being doing so why shouldn't the same apply to them when they are older.

UglierThanMoe,AskReddit,1391050759.0,"&gt; Why is getting Gastric Bypass now becoming the go to weight loss solution for obese people?

Because fat people think it'll allow them to lose a lot of weight without them having to actually do anything. It's even true at the beginning; since you can't eat nearly as much as you are used to, you lose a lot of weight quickly. But then the body adapts to the reduced calorie input and you stop losing and often even start gaining weight again. It's not that Gastric Bypass surgery is pointless, but it's only the first step. If you stop after that, you just wasted a lot of money.

I'm a fat bastard myself, but Gastric Bypass surgery is not an option for me. If and when I'm finally fed up with being fat (no pun intended), I'm going to adjust my diet and work out. I know it's not long until I reach that point, because that's how I quit smoking; I got fed up with it more and more, and one day I just said ""fuck it"" and haven't touched a cigarette since."

I hope Russell turns out better than those guys but this is an unusually high ranking and I'm sure Law is going to take a lot of flack for it. The difference probably lies in two things:

1) Law gives more weight to Russell's age-relative-to-competition than other scouts do.

2) Law believes Russell can be an elite defender at SS where other scouts seem to think he will merely be good."

PlushieChomby,relationships,1391051010.0,"This is great advice, and I second the opinion that Lexapro won't make you more satisfied with your life. I took it for over a year almost a decade ago. On one hand, it was the first time I ever remembered waking up every day without feeling like I was being sucked into a black hole from which there was no escape; I thought everyone felt like that every day and they were just all dealing with it better than I was - I didn't realize it's unnatural and an indicator of deep depression. On the other hand, I could barely function without twelve to fourteen hours of sleep a day (having gone from eight years of sleeping two to four hours a night), had dreams so realistic I thought I'd accomplished them in real life (which fucked up a few things at work for me), and basically had my enormous palette of emotions reduced to two: anger and apathy. So if you're thinking anti-depressants alone are going to be a solution, they're not. They're a tool that can be very helpful or very destructive if you get the wrong ones. I quit lexapro cold turkey and started having bizarre thoughts like, I wonder what it would be like to drive off this bridge and maybe I should walk in front of that bus. I wasn't suicidal, the thoughts just manifested. So talk to your therapist (it's so good you're already in therapy, OP!) and maybe see if there's a cheaper alternative anti-depressant you could take, as there are a **lot** that are cheaper than lexapro and may very well fit your needs just the same or better. 

Please remember that the grass is greenest where you water it. If you're spending a great deal of time focusing on or thinking about how you wish your life was different, how many other things you could maybe be doing, that's going to look like the brighter solution, though reality may prove it to ultimately be a mistake. You so rarely truly understand the downsides to things until you're living through them. 

You have a little girl. You have a loving husband who doesn't abuse you, who cares about and supports you. Maybe look at things you could do to improve your life as is before throwing it all away. Like /u/generousheart said, try to thrive in the framework you've set up by finding activities and groups of friends that can supplement your life and make it more fulfilling. Volunteer. Take up a hobby or few. Start selling things online, or crafting, or both. Make a list of your interests and put some ideas down on how you can fulfill them where you are. Then take active steps to pursue them and discuss how things are going with your therapist. 

Also consider that, just like you ran from your broken home toward something that you wanted, something that seemed more stable and safe, you might be repeating that pattern by wanting to abandon your marriage in pursuit of adventure this time: an adventure you didn't previously allow yourself to have for fear you wouldn't have a safety net to fall back on. You got married at a pretty young age, to a guy you'd been seeing since you were twenty, and it's completely understandable that you didn't yet know what you wanted or who you were going to turn out to be, so it's easy to view your choices as a mistake, but in the long run there may very well be a good chance for you *and* your family to come out of this happy. Something that struck me while reading your post is that you said you live in the midwest, and later mentioned in your fantasy, you take your daughter and go live in a city. I'm not sure where you live now, obviously, but perhaps location and limited access to helpful resources is at least a factor in your current state of being. I live in a house in the heart of downtown in my state's capital, and often fantasize about how nice it would be to live in the country where I didn't have to put up with wailing sirens and screaming dipshits and motorcycles without mufflers every damned night of the week. I know it's not your number one issue, but take into consideration the effect your location has on your mindset. Do you think you might be more ready to find happiness as a complete family with your husband and daughter if you lived somewhere else, somewhere bigger with more opportunity? Or do you think your feelings would remain the same and you'd still long to be single? 

Admittedly, if you didn't have a child together, I'd be more lax in my view because the reality is that you're both plenty young enough to find other partners who could love and be loved by you in the way you both deserve. I watched a lot of friends grow up in broken and splintered homes where their opinions varied from, ""My parents split when I was two, so all I really cared about growing up was that I got two sets of presents for Christmas,"" to, ""I hate my mom/dad for leaving; I can't believe how selfish he/she was and I'm never going to be like her/him when *I* grow up."" Hopefully someone with personal experience will chime in on this thread. Guilt is never a good reason to stay in a relationship, even a marriage, but fantasizing about what life *might* be like is never a reason to leave one that's otherwise well-functioning in my opinion, either. Not when you're married and have a kid together, anyway. 

Whatever you decide, I wish all of you the best of luck, and I hope you stay in therapy - a good therapist is worth infinite times more the amount of advice you'll receive from internet strangers. "

[Now for something with citations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textbooks_in_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict)
&gt;Several studies have been done on Palestinian text books. The U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem commissioned studies from IPCRI – Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information). In Europe the Georg Eckert Institute performed research. The Hebrew University's Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace has also published papers on this issue. A U.S. Senate subcommittee and the Political Committee of the European Parliament have both held hearings about Palestinian textbooks.[1] Israel has used the issue as a cornerstone of its Hasbara campaign against the Palestinian Authority.[2] Palestinians say that their textbooks rightly focus on their own national narrative, which includes the privations of life under occupation.[3]

&gt;A comprehensive three year study (2009–2012), regarded by its researchers as ' the most definitive and balanced study to date on the topic,'[4][5] found that incitement, demonization or negative depictions of the other in children's education was ""extremely rare"" in both Israeli and Palestinian school texts, with only 6 instances discovered in over 9,964 pages of Palestinian textbooks, none of which consisted of ""general dehumanising characterisations of personal traits of Jews or Israelis"".[4] Israeli officials rejected the study as biased, while Palestinian Authority officials claimed it vindicated their view that their textbooks are as fair and balanced as Israel's.[6]

&gt;Textbooks in Israel also have been studied and some problems found. Israel has ordered the word Nakba (referring to the 1948 forced Palestinian exodus from Israeli-occupied lands) to be removed from Israeli Arab textbooks. The term was introduced in books for use in Arab schools in 2007 when the Education Ministry was run by Yuli Tamir of the Labour party. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the ban by saying that the term was ""propaganda against Israel.""[7]"

They're all new, so I had to teach them how to play. The first time we met, I played through a few sample encounters, and they liked it, so I started a campaign.

They started when their hometown was invaded by thousands of kobolds. The dragonborn paladin, played by a cocky sonofabitch, was quite proud of the 5 or so kobolds he could kill at once from time to time, but he quickly got overwhelmed. The ranger and warlock, keeping their distance, urged him to try and escape with them.

They ran through the streets, fighting off crafty kobolds, until they finally had to cut through a small force that was guarding the south gate (2 city gates, north gate was the area of the attack). This is 4e, so minions. Oh yes, minions.

They then took a few sessions to establish themselves in a nearby small hamlet, and will soon be infiltrating the town looking for a way to kill the dragon (by sneaking into a library).

[Takitsubo Rikou's](http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Takitsubo_Rikou) *AIM Stalker* ability, at level 5, might be able to control personal realities and AIM fields in such a way that she could emulate any power, with her ""real"" power being the control of AIM fields.

The players in my campaign are raiding an abandoned wizard's college, so there's going to be good magic items at the top in the head wizard's tower, and low-level items / cursed items / hilarious items all through the tower.

I'm still thinking them up, but here's a few.

1 - Bag of Scolding.

This Bag of Holding will spit an item out and yell at you if it doesn't like the item.

2 - Earbug

An ear with insectlike legs and a small mouth, can be commanded to go up to 20ft away (it's tiny, so that means past doors and up into windows and such) and listen for any amount of time before returning and repeating what it has heard.

3 - Watercrackers

Firecrackers, but they spray water everywhere. Still a loud bang though.

4 - Dagger of Unintention

Whenever you try to use this dagger for something, it does something completely different. Want to stab someone? It heals them. Want to cut meat? It hardens it. Want to throw the dagger? It goes in a random direction. DM's discretion. Hilarity encouraged.

5 - Vial of Supreme Holding

It works as a very powerful Bag of Holding (ridiculous amount of space), but since it's a vial, it has a very, very tiny opening. It also isn't water-tight.

6 - Ball of Unpredictable Bounciness

This is a small rubber ball which, upon contact with any hard surface (with a certain base speed so you could, say, catch it and put it in your pocket), bounces... or not. It will have a random amount of bounciness, so you could throw it against a wall and it could bounce back, rocket back like a bullet or flop down like a bag of sand.

7 - Retractible Stiletto

Pretty much what you think it is.

8 - Bag of Dicks

Bag of tricks, but instead of live animals it produces varied sizes, shapes and colours of dildos.

9 - Accelerating Stones

These stones feel like normal pebbles, but when you try and throw them, it is incredibly difficult. However, upon release, they accelerate. Thus, you would have to try really hard, but you could, given the right accuracy, throw this stone across a valley and have it embed itself deep within the mountain on the other side. The downside is that not only is it really, really hard to throw but it is also really, really hard to aim. Each pebble has one use only.

10 - Vorpal Fork

Does 1d2 damage. Has a 5% chance of decapitation on low-level enemies.

If you feel you are a good student you will get through them with some dedication. The geo department is a well knit community. the classes are fun and challenging in the best way and has a good club going at the moment. 

The Ozarks are fantastic. If you go to S&amp;T make some friends and make sure to go camping and hiking. There are plenty of clubs and organizations to help you find the best places to go.

Anything fantastic? That's up to you and your preferences. The campus is small and has a good flow. It being an engineering campus is obvious in how simple and concise things are throughout campus. It's in the middle of the town so getting around is easy. All in all, I liked the school. There is a drawback that may or may not effect you. Guy:girl ratio of 3:1.

You mentioned that turn 3/4 wins are possible, and they are (Hell, I got a turn 3 win at GP: DC!) but like you mentioned in a post, you aren't and shouldn't really be going for them.

A few other quick points:

* This deck mulligans better than you might think
* Goblin Matron is misleadingly difficult to play. It's like a slightly simpler Birthing Pod. Keep all the lines in mind, there can be a lot of them.
* I would play one maindecked artifact hate. Tin-Street Hooligan is fine. I personally don't own duals and run a Tuktuk Scrapper. But without one, Stoneforge Mystic can be a nightmare.

If you have any other questions, I consider myself fairly decent with the deck. Feel free to ask. Enjoy Goblins!

To clarify:

[Here are boy Scouts policies on being religious](http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/guidetoadvancement/appendix/charterandbylaws.aspx). It requires in a believe in God (or gods as BSA recognizes pantheistic, polytheistic religions). It also requires a scout to be faithful to religious duties and respect the beliefs of others. BSA does not discriminate among religions. A Scout may be Christian, Muslims, Hindu Buddhist ect. 

Keep in mind, Boy Scouts is very decentralized and troop leaders (usually parents) are really the ones who decide who many join the troop. Boy Scouts don't have spies and have no real way of knowing who is obeying the guidelines. In fact, many troop leader don't even bother with reading all of them. I lived in a liberal area and knew many openly gay and atheist scouts and scout leaders. In liberal areas, the membership rules are just words on paper. Being a Boy Scout does not mean you subscribe to everything Boy Scout authorities do and say. In fact, many boy scouts openly oppose them.

After having a glorious dogfight with a Ki-43 (he crashed, silly jap), I realized that it was me in my tiny Ishak versus three fireproof, bulletproof H6K4s.

After repairing I decided to go on the offensive, quickly locating the second boat.  *shwewshwewshwew* *bing*. The second boat down.  

But at this point I was out of rockets and out of time, I decided to attack the last enemy at his own base.  Unfortunately the Japanese have magic bullets that can merge right through their planes, so his front gunner managed to set me on fire with a single .30cal.  However I was not going to let the Japs win, I decided to ram the bastard.  With the last of my tail control I drove my little Ishak right through his cockpit in a glorious Stalinwood fireball that burned with the intensity of a thousand suns.

They enter a room. There is a deep pit full of spikes in the middle. They must jump over. On the far side, unbeknownst to the players, are pressure plates. These trigger an arrow, which hits a button, which lets loose a rock on a track, which knocks over a wood block, which triggers a tripwire, which launches another arrow at another button, which lets loose a rock on a string, which knocks over a bucket of water, which fills another bucket, whose weight on a seesaw lifts a stick, which triggers another tripwire, which pulls something in the wall, which, with a loud clunk, followed by three clicks, a snap, another click, a clunk, a whirr, two clunks, three more clicks and a snap, then a whapp as a trap in the ceiling opens and a log attached to a rope swings down low, tripping the players, knocking them into the pit.

Will save to not be transfixed.

Another one is to have a floor full of pressure plates, so full that it's impossible not to hit one. The walls are full of holes and slits and there are tripwires everywhere. Every time they trigger something, there's a click or a snap or a clunk or a whirr, but nothing happens. As more and more traps are set off, you hear snickering from beyond tiny slits in the walls.

I'm *not* trying to say ""every woman is a big dick lover, they just don't know it"" or something.  I know for a fact that's not true.  I am saying that though there *are* women (quite a lot actually) who definitely prefer average, it *seems* that usually, according to the FAQs, that the ones who express an interest in the visual appeal or the aesthetics of a penis, are *usually* the ones that like the visual appeal or aesthetics of a large penis and therefore, if a man were to want to satisfy his hypothetical fantasy (the one I talked about in my first post) of being as visually sexy and desirable as possible and make his penis visually appeal to the most women, he would want a dick that is most usually appreciated for its appearance, meaning, a big dick."

aDDnTN,personalfinance,1391053633.0,"Where did you find that? I was trying to look it up for tn and I didn't find it. I swear I've seen it before.

I passed first time and didn't even take a class about it. Where I work people have taken it many times (&amp;gt;15) and never passed. Crazy.

Also, is commuting in your own car with $2000 a year? Consider the value of less personal risk and liability. Consider the value of the stress you deal with driving in traffic.

Btw, I take mass transit, carpool, or ride my motorcycle."

laaabaseball,csshelp,1391053666.0,"You have to add a different class in the css for those users. Don't add anything to the flair templates, but in grant flair, add the flair text in the spot and put a css class for them *blank*, and add this to your CSS:

    .flair.flair-blank {
    background: none !important;
    border: 1px solid #000 !important;
    color: #000;
    }

Then whenever you grant someone text flair, put the flair text but make sure to add the class *blank*.

I have text and image flair in /r/angelsbaseball if you want to see an advanced version."
