cudtastic,nba,1389851300.0,"So people can only report on things that the organization releases? I'm not sure you understand how journalism works. People inside the team will often leak information to reporters. Sometimes intentionally so the news reports something, and sometimes it's just someone who is telling things to a reporter unbeknownst to others in the organization. You act as if you want a link to a press release where the Heat organization formally announces it is not going to go after Bynum. That isn't always going to happen, but it doesn't discredit the information from inside sources, though it may be somewhat less trustworthy.

In the time between your post and this one, Oden played 8 minutes tonight against Washington. Regardless, of course he is a risk, so who knows what will happen with the roster. I'm just saying I could see both making sense, and we have no idea what the injury situation is of Wade and Chalmers. If they are in fact somewhat seriously injured then it could make sense to keep Douglas. If they are fully healthy then it could also make sense to go after Bynum. But like I said before, we play small ball a lot and won the last two championships without significant contributions from true centers.

Anyway, the point is that there is no media agenda here. RealGM just posts content from their own sources, or content from other media outlets. Even if the Heat do end up cutting Douglas or someone else and signing Oden it doesn't change the fact that the original report was still valid."

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1389851506.0,"I try SO hard not to be shitty to people about their questions (even though I slip sometimes). Because I completely and totally understand that not everyone knows cars that well. I don't know everything in the world, there's some stuff I don't know either and ask questions about. I wouldn't want people to scoff at my seemingly obtuse questions either. 

It's not so much that people ask dense questions It's more that people can't take the time to do the research themselves or even provide enough information about their problem to diagnose. I'm not the most tech savvy guy, even though I grew up in nascent days of computers and internet. I know enough to get by. I know fuckall about programming, but I do know enough to fix most computer related issues. Thank god for the internet i've been able to google, diagnose, and fix just about every computer problem i've ever had. And the handful of times when my efforts failed, I let a professional fix it.

Most of the people that post here, can't even do that. They can't even google. They come on here for a very general problem, didn't search google, and want their hand held. You can't fix a car via the internet. You just can't. You can get a general idea of what's happening, but you need all the information you can get. I can't help OPs who can't properly explain the problem or who I have to play 20 questions with to get information from, tiny bits at a time. I just can't.

Half the time OPs post questions here that aren't even right for this subreddit.

/u/derphurr said something recently in another post, and it's genius. Because it just outlines the direct this subreddit is in. And highlights the kind of post this subreddit is. Either very general questions (car stopped running, what do I do?) or very specific questions (where can I get a hubcap for a 1974 Coronado)

&gt;You ask something like what is cost of new 2011 V6 engine. Just freaking google it. You think someone really has that knowledge to contribute?


&gt;*I agree with you they should allow more general car related questions. But on the other hand, you have to understand it isn't a community like /r/doctorwho. It is thousands of drive by ungrateful people getting free advice (that probably saves them hundreds of dollars) and it only works because of probably less than a hundred or few dozen regular contributors.*


&gt;*So it is a many to one relationship, and it is rude to use up time on questions that don't have an answer, like which is the best used car, or which radio should I get.*

EU does not have uniform immigration laws, but you will not qualify for a visa in a lot of western European countries if you don't have a university degree related to your field.

You must also realize that copyright laws etc. are not uniform around the world, and that contracts in Europe will very likely be written in the local language first and foremost. The music industry in Europe is also much more fragmented than in the US mostly because of the language barriers. If I were you I would contact some companies within the industry in Europe and get a reality check of what kind of people they are looking for, if they're looking at all, and whether or not they'd be willing to sponsor your visa.

All-in-all, this isn't a case of putting in work or effort. Europe is in a crisis and immigrants are still flooding in.

So just start by disassembling from the first piece of code, then add in routines that you know about, and label everything. Slowly it will come together and you'll start finding code on your own. I'll admit I've come across some interesting snippets of code in Fire Red that I wouldn't have found otherwise if it weren't for IDA.

That said, though I personally consider it a pretty great game, imo that's more about the feel and the challenge of it rather than having a super emotional tearjerker story so it's not necessarily something that fits OP's criteria.

As teams got eliminated, more and more people began rooting for this team as a sort of cinderella story. They made it to the NFC Championship game, and I remember countless montages about the devastation in the city and how the Saints were helping to bring people together and so on. I'm pretty sure most of the country was rooting for them at that point.

PlushieChomby,funny,1389853281.0,"There was that one, but there have actually been quite a few ridiculous cases of burglars and their families suing after break-ins went wrong. For instance, do a ctrl F on [this page](http://www.legalzoom.com/lawsuits-settlements/personal-injury/top-ten-frivolous-lawsuits) for ""Larry Harris"" and you can read about the dipshit whose family sued a bar owner after their idiotic spawn ignored warning signs and broke into a bar, electrocuting himself to death. In the end, they were awarded $150k, later reduced to $75k, which is **still** utter bullshit. 

Or [this dimwit](http://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/lawsuit-of-the-day-kidnapper-sues-hostages-for-breach-of-contract/) who sued people he held as hostages in their own home while on the run from murder charges. For what? *Breach of fuckin' contract.* 

There was even [this thoughtless asshole](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/10/24/burglar-who-shot-marin-county-homeowner-in-face-suing/) who sued an old man *he shot in the fucking face* because the homeowner returned fire. 

Oftentimes the cases get thrown out, but other times people get rewarded for their bad behavior, whether by a jury awarding them or by the person they're suing settling to avoid incurring further legal debt fighting the suit. Makes me happy to live in a state with strong castle doctrine. "

Beyond that the idea of zeroing out is a terribly inefficient way to do what you're suggesting. The balance is known. The sensible thing is to top up based on an existing balance upon the next transfer payment. That does the same thing while eliminating an unnecessary transaction and for any balance which remains at the top up amount, no transaction is required at all. A terrible idea regardless IMO."

HUNDREDS of people already come to jog the reservoir every single day.  

People complained about the jogging path affecting parking.  Then it got built and it was actually nice.  More people using it meant less crime.  People complained about the ""Meadow"" and their parking.  Then it got built and it's basically a postcard for awesome.  Kids skipping and flying kites, people reading, exercising, and making out.  Some locals will piss and moan about parking again when the reservoirs open.  Not me.  I want to live next to a great big park.  

If ""parking"" is your best argument against opening a huge wetlands and greenspace in a city that needs neighborhood parks desperately then I'm not convinced.  People can (and do) bike and take the existing bus line.

Even if it's not the full aquatic center envisioned here, there's a place for a splash park and recreational use of the water in SOME form, in my opinion.  And I'm the one who will be negatively affected."

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1389855137.0,"Capital assets are not liquid enough to support this kind of system. Realizing a capital gain takes time. Taxes on such assets for anyone without a liquid income sufficient to cover the taxable amount would in essence be forced to either sell or the government seize the assets for liquidation. It's like a threat of foreclosure and tax liens on steroids. I think that is not a slope down which we should really be traveling.

Capital markets may well collapse erasing a lot of that on paper wealth. I mean you're talking about issuing Bill Gates a tax bill next year of $25M * 73 = $1.825B. He doesn't have remotely that much in liquid assets. They're mostly property and stock. You need cash to make payments. His only way to acquire that much cash is to sell. Multiply his sell off by all the financial elites and you've got a shitload of sellers in the market. Who's going to buy? What do you expect the market impact of that tax bill issued to these people in year one? http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/

Edit: I'm not saying wealth taxes cannot play into the equation, but a system built on liquidating capital assets annually seems to me a poor method of doing so. Perhaps taxing assets integrating them into a sovereign wealth fund which manages dividends and slowly releases those assets into the market would work better. Though I'd still expect sell offs as a result devaluing the paper wealth held by US citizens. Anything attempting to do something like this should proceed with great care as it's way beyond most marginal tax rate changes we might make."

&gt; create an image of it on your primary SSD

Unfortunately, I only have 82GB free on my primary solid state drive.

After attempting to migrate everything over with EaseUS Todo Backup (unsuccessfully, the partition is not aligned correctly), I thought of a possible solution.

I do have a cable I can use to connect either the new SSD or old HDD to a USB 3 port. In theory, I could simply wipe the drive (making sure the new partition is aligned properly), manually copy over all the contents of the drive through Windows, then reassign the drive letter of the new SSD to match the old as to avoid registry errors. Would this be a viable option or would I run into errors?

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389857053.0,"I'm pretty sure a chess board with only penis pieces would get criticized not just because some people would feel awkward playing it but because it adds nothing to the game and arguably the names/shapes of the original chess pieces do have some point in helping you a bit to remember what the pieces do (for example having a piece called the king reminds you that he's the most important one, picture a game of chess that called the littlest pieces children or princes instead of pawns or peasants). So yes, making a chess game where all pieces look like a penis would arguably make the game worse and not just because ""embarassing"". Having a ""ludo narrative dissonance"" between what the pieces are called and what they do in game would make chess less perfect and be worth criticizing/worth changing to make the game better even if what the pieces do and what strategies exist would stay exactly the same. 

Even if you made just one piece a penis it might make the game worse because some things just have a real life meaning that is so strong that it overrides whatever meaning it has in a game sense. (and it might not fit thematically with what the rest of the pieces look like and are called; so you would have to rename/change all pieces of fit a sex theme, but then you would have a harder time explaining how these properly reflect the theme/feel of the game; so yes, in that case, changing a chess piece into a penis or nipple or Mahatma Ghandi would indeed make the game of chess less good)

The game system underneath might still be great, but the packaging around it might be terrible and fundamentally flawed. The problem is that we have only one word (game) for both the mechanics inside and the overall package. But that doesn't change that when we talk about a game in the form of buying recommendation or review we do talk about the overall package. 

For example, let's say you were reviewing a chess set where the pieces are made out of paper that instantly rip when you touch it. You would give it a 0 out of 10/Do Not Buy regardless of how awesome chess actually is because you are reviewing this specific packaging which is indeed unusable for anybody and hence there is no point in buying it in this state. Just like you would do the same for a game that doesn't start up on your platform, the fact that there might be a good game system somewhere inside is meaningless if the game does not run/start up. Other package elements like music or even art style can contribute a lot to whether we can enjoy the underlying game mechanics. 

The concept of reviewing only the abstact mechanics/game underneath is pretty meaningless in a concrete review where you do have to review as well whether these abstract mechanics can be accessed and enjoyed without annoyance (from let's say bugs or horrible music or sucky ""want to stab my eyes out"" art style). =&gt; so looking only at the game mechanics is in the end the job of academics, not reviewers. The job of reviewers is to give a more complete, more generally usable ""package"" point of view.

[and that doesn't even cover all the people that look at games more from a simulation/experience angle than a game angle and judge a game more on whether or not they feel it makes for a compelling simulation]"

Like my non-lgbt friends would be cool with it and supportive, but really wouldn't understand or want to talk about it.

**I Am Not A Serial Killer** by Dan Wells. A psychopathic 14 year old and his fight not to become a killer. Lots of fun stuff on the nature of good and evil and an introduction to how the mental health system should work.

**The Curious Incident of th Dog in the Night Time**. I can't remember the author, but this one is about a young autistic boy searching for the truth behind his mother. Goes into detail about how he sees the world and what is important to him.

**The Cartographer** by Peter Twohig. Rounding out the mental illness set we have Multi-Personality Disorder. After the death of his twin a young boy in Melbourne, Australia uses a series of superhero alternate persona's to face the world. A lot of adventure and action in here."

Without wasting your time, I know exactly how chocletemilkshark's sister feels.  Your child is your child, no matter their sex.  Their ancestors are their ancestors, no matter their sex.  

Females aren't property anymore.  There is no dowry paid to get rid of them.  Please rethink the specifics of your tradition, if it is in fact the same as the previous poster, in that the box passes to a son.  

I have items that belonged to many members of my family, male and female alike.  I can tell you that if I only received items that belonged to females I would feel more than slighted.  Am I not good enough to receive the items from males? I am not worthy because I'm a female? That makes zero sense. And what if you have only daughters. Would you reluctantly give her the box when she's 30, once your wife can no longer bear you children? ""Oh here, my firstborn daughter.  I was saving this for my super special and super wanted son, but since it looks like your mother went and got old and useless, I'll never get to have my dream child so just give this to your son, OK?"" That's what she'll feel like.  Unwanted. Unloved. Insignificant. Like she's nothing and doesn't count.

And what if your firstborn, born female, decides to become a male? Where does the box go then?

Just make your tradition better.  Gift it to your firstborn and include items from grandmothers as well."

Cyfun06,gaming,1389857689.0,"My dad used to manage a garbage company. We'd find all sorts of great shit in the trash.  Costco once came through and dropped off about a dozen aluminum racing car jacks. They were perfectly functional, just had some scratches from falling off a palette or something.  Immediately, all the employees grabbed one.

The guy from Costco told his boss, who came and tried to bitch out my dad because they were supposed to be destroyed.  Dad pointed out to him that once something is in the garbage, they've given up their rights to it and it's essentially fair game.  The guy's argument is that if a jack broke while supporting a car and injured someone, they could sue Costco. Or someone might try to return one to Costco without a receipt.  Dad agreed with him, but explained that they aren't in the business of destroying shit, just disposing of it.

So the next time a bunch of potentially good shit from Costco came through, it was all fucked to hell. I think it was electronics of some kind.  Apparently they'd had their driver run over it before they hauled it down.

Bella teaches girls to be victims - weak little girls with low self esteem who are drawn to dominant and dangerous men who isolate you from your friends and family, all under the disguise of ""the greatest love of all"" a la Romeo and Juliet.

Does that mean the schoolyard bully gets free reign to bully the general population and is given a gun to do it with? All too often, the answer is yes.

Also (I don't mean for this to sound patronising because I do think it's relevant) you were a lot younger than he was when you cheated, I think it's more understandable for a 14 year old girl to make a poor choice than a 19/20 year old man.

It doesn't just make me slightly uncomfortable, I get breathing problems and at some point lose my voice if there's enough smoke around. Second hand smoke is damaging and I'd rather avoid it, instead of allow it because there's already other things that are unhealthy too.

I hope I'm not sounding smug, but my aversion to smoking is never something personal. But if there's people like me, and younger children, that feel a noticable effect, why should it be allowed because smokers will consider them 'pussies'?

BlueCarrotAntenna,MapPorn,1389863555.0,"Both our experiences are anecdotal evidence of course, my experience is is simply different from yours. :)

Perhaps it's also because I hang a lot around family and family friends, so I come into contact with a lot of people of various ages, while if you just look around a busy street or a bar you're subconsciously more noticing the attractive people there. It's my experience that young Russian girls are thin and kind of ""lightly built"", but then when a lot of women get older they go into the overweight range, but seldom do they get obese like what you see on American reality shows.

To compare this to Norway for example (where I live now), I'd say that it's much more common for girls to be in the normal weight range (i.e. not skinny or overweight), and at the same time have bigger cup size, which makes them look not so lightly built. This remains true until higher age, and I work with plenty of women in their 40s and 50s who remain in a very good shape."

I work at one of the local shops that routinely underbids apple. I have some good news and some bad news. The bad news is that since this is an Apple you will pay much more then what a PC owner will pay. The good news is that since it's an apple the odds are you didn't brick the notebook by spilling water on it. Take a look at this picture: http://www.gainsaver.com/Gainsaver/StoreUploads/Images/661-6072.gif

That is what the underside of your keyboard looks like, it is sealed plastic. Unlike most PC manufactures there is no path for water to take between the keyboard and the motherboard. Also look here: http://esimport.fr/tuto/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3-DEMONTAGE-BATTERIE-A1237.jpg

If the KB did leak it would most likely leak onto the sealed battery and not onto the motherboard. Compare it to any HP or Dell: http://i1263.photobucket.com/albums/ii626/laptoppartstore/HP%20DM4/HPPavilionDM4-6.jpg http://www.laptop-keyboard.org/Laptop-Keyboards/K-HCQ-55-O.jpg 
It's more like a colander then anything. 

The problem with the apple design is that you end up replacing the entire top part of the notebook. If you look at the bottom of the notebook you should be able to get the numbers off the bottom for the series number; from there you can get the part number for the top keyboard assembly. This might or might not include the touchpad and speakers depending on your model. My method for finding these parts is to start with google and amazon. Then look for people who have a working apple with a broken screen, buy that and use it for spare parts. If you can post the model number I might be able to find the part, the alternative would be to open the apple and look for the part number on the top case. 

As Transatlantic points out; Apple is in the sales business, not the repair business and many shops are also going that way. They might not even know how to approach this repair and are pulling up a number to try and sell you on a new computer. I'm guessing that this is something a technical person could do over a week end, but I'm not a good gauge of relative difficulty. "

He'd sailed off into obscurity sometime when I was just entering the phase in elementary school when the teachers blushingly turn the lights off in the classroom so you can have your first ever ""Life and Reproduction"" class.  He'd left my grandmother before I was born, but I had known what that did to my mother ever time I made a mistake growing up.  I was a liar, a jerk, a piece of shit, it was all because of what he left behind when he disappeared past the horizon.  When he finally broke free of the insane mess he'd created all those years ago in some English chapel with the hope he'd made my grandmother an ""honest"" woman.

My father had come to the rescue when my sister was conceived.  Her birthday was exactly seven months before my parent's first wedding anniversary, a fact that sat quietly among many other issues that just were not spoke of.  I arrived a few years later to a family that had all the trappings of a regular *Norman Rockwell* painting save for the odd number of grandparents I had.  The generation ahead of your parents is easily idealized when contact with them is minimal.

Not that he was a complete cipher to me growing up.  Every few months or so, there would appear on the fridge a postcard or photograph of a vaguely familiar man smiling in front of some palm trees, or a canyon, or an elaborate European building somewhere.  I would read the script on the back, looking for something to relate to, but it never really came.

I'd passed through high school without incident.  Took a job with the local GM factory, just like 80% of the kids I had known since kindergarten.  I'd expected make something of myself.  To get out of this rut that I'd known long before I knew what a ""rut"" was.  By 22 I was out on my own, having neither the desire nor the resources to ever have a garage or a front lawn or a porch to sit on after work.  Sure beats some shithole downtown in the projects.  Still, I was learning what it meant when the ""neighborhood"" you lived in was mentioned in polite conversation.

I'd made it to Friday again.  The car out front had been there since last night, but with all the bizarre and fleeting sights you see in this neighbourhood, I really hadn't thought that much of it.  Someone on the block had maxed out another credit card for a bachelor's party or some other silly thing.  It was a pretty nice looking ride.  Black, with a subtle tone along the undercarriage of chrome or maybe stainless steel.  It wasn't until I got home from work when I noticed the envelope under the windshield wiper.  I was admiring the front grill when I realized my name was written in the corner.  My head swiveled as I snatched it, half expecting hidden cameras or giggling friends crouched somewhere.  I tore the seam, and pulled the card inside out into view, suddenly noticing how dirty my hands were.  That familiar face looked back at me.  He was in bed.  He looked far older than I'd ever seen him.  The expression in his face was sad, but with the remnants of a mischievous smirk.  I flipped the card.

Avistew,polyamory,1389865761.0,"My first experience was with a guy who was 36. While we did not have a serious relationship, I had known him for a while and trusted him, and it was a good experience.

It's difficult to have an opinion without knowing more about the specifics. It could be a really bad idea if they have nothing in common and are hoping to build a long-term relationship, but then again it could work out fine.

I'm sure that he did not ""pick"" her because she's younger than you, though. I know that in our society we always have that fear to be replaced by someone younger, and my gut tells me it probably contributes to your reaction. Through media and society we have been trained, as women, to have that kind of reaction towards younger women, even those who barely interact with our boyfriends or husbands.

In this case, it's very real since he's interested in her, and so I'm sure all these messages are there somewhere inside of you controlling your emotions.

I think sometimes the only thing to do is simply to focus on something completely different so you can calm down. Watch a funny movie or take a work or exercise or listen to music... whatever you normally do to relax. The more you think about it, the more you might obsess on it and just feel completely horrible, while knowing that he's not really doing anything wrong.

Then, long-term, I guess getting to know her and knowing her as a person (and not as the age she is) would probably help. I would not imagine dating a much younger guy either, but on the other hand I could totally see dating someone who is 20 years older than me... Sure I'm not in my early 20s anymore, but it was true at the time to.

And either way, what matters isn't really whether you would do it, but whether it can work and leave everyone happy, regardless of the form it ends up taking. You know your husband and so you know, I assume, that he wouldn't hurt her and that he'd follow the campsite rule (leave a younger, less experienced partner in better shape than you found them).

Venting can feel good, but it can also make you obsess on things, so I'll repeat my advice of trying to take your mind off of it. You'll still think about it and feel terrible, just try hard to push the feelings away for a bit. Ignoring one's feelings can be bad, but when they're strong, and when we feel or know they're unreasonable, it's good to give them time to be more manageable before we can face them and deal with what caused them.

Whether it's the fear of him going to someone younger (and possibly finding her better than older you) or the idea that he might take advantage of her/hurt her, what you feel is most likely projection and not an assessment of the actual, specific situation (and I only say that because you do seem to feel that way yourself).

Hopefully you can go back to being touched by him soon, even if you say you don't want to talk about it right away. I find touch is very helpful for me, but you are probably right that it could make things worse if too soon."

I do have some critique to offer, if you're amicable: 

- Word in the title ought to be ""excerpt"" 

- You'll need to work on separating some of that stream of consciousness into paragraphs, though that could just be reddit's formatting. (In which case, pressing the enter key twice will give you a space between paragraphs)

- You've got a bit of redundancy in there (excessive repetitions of words or phrases and expressing the same idea about six different ways when it could be compressed, that sort of thing) that could use some editing.

Keep writing, you'll find you improve more and more. It is also often very helpful for us to read in excess so we get a solid ""sense"" of word flow and stylistic differences, and economic use of words. 

I highly recommend you read Stephen King's ""On Writing"" because it gives would-be authors some really really great tips in a humorous fashion, and is a pretty decent starting point.

predalienmack,AskReddit,1389867206.0,"It is apparently quite common for kids to masturbate in school. I had no idea...here's a masturbation story from my high school experience: 

In my senior English class, our desks were set up where half the desks were on one side of the class facing the other half of the desks that were aligned on the opposite end of the class. The teacher would pace back and forth down the space in between the desks as she lectured (if you're curious as to how the class would function when set up that way). 

I happened to have this class with a kid that we'll call Rob (he's autistic). He always enjoyed the material in the class, though he had trouble comprehending a lot of the themes and discussions we engaged in. He enjoyed it so much that he loved to sit in the front row of the desks on one side of the classroom so he could better understand what was going on with fewer distractions. He also wore sweatpants every day, which'll be important in just a second. 

There were always the slightly disgusting and/or hilarious (in a ""I feel bad for laughing"" kind of way) situations where for example, he'd fart quite loudly in the middle of a lecture or throw temper tantrums or sneeze into his hand and play with/lick the mucus that came out, but one day we (meaning my friends and I who sat on the opposite end of the classroom facing him) saw the grossest thing we ever saw him do that semester...he had an obvious erection making a tent in his sweatpants and he was gently rubbing it with his hand (outside the sweatpants) under his desk as he bit a nail on his other hand in a very creepy way and stared at something on the ceiling. This continued for most of the hour and fifteen minute long class period until at some point our teacher noticed as she was sitting at her desk and had him talk to her outside. I was surprised she didn't notice sooner considering a good portion of my side of the classroom had been suppressing various stages of laughter for most of the class. "

If we were that bad I wouldn't expect to see RvP perennially injured again this year for utd.

Generally I don't think many people on this sub could name every player currently injured for utd, Chelsea, sp*rs, city or Liverpool either so it's also probably down to the fact that you're not paying as much attention to their injuries.

New information ""DARK SOULS II (Dark Soul II)"" is full of, the case a great deal of attention to the characters' unique! [The Famitsu issue coming January 16th, 2014 will have an article on Dark Souls 2, coming to consoles and PC. We'll talk about some unique NPCs friendly to the player!]

World setting and story have been revealed at last! [Pretty obvious]  
And stage of adventure and introduction to the story, which has been shrouded in secrecy until now, the world setting of this work, revealed at last. Become the scene of this film, a country called ""Dolan Greig"". In this area that there is power ""soul"" to solve the curse, players journey to seek the hardship he begins. [The player has journeyed to the land of Drangleic, in search of some sort of Soul power that can lift his curse.]

Pilgrimage of Midorikoromo
(A mysterious woman to lead the player)[The hooded, black haired woman seen in the very first reveal trailer. On a pilgrimage?]  
Woman of mystery wearing Midorikoromo Nestled Bonfire of the earth at the end of the Doranguigu called ""Made~yura"" in (bonfire) near. To help the player, this meet women from the early stages will lead. It is very important person in advancing the journey of discovery. [Sounds to me like she's a Firekeeper. Perhaps the last of her kind? It sounds like she will be helped in places throughout the game. Perhaps she plays a role in seeking that Soul power the player wants?]

Land of a new pilgrimage, his name Doran Greig.[Drangleic]  
Player with the land of Dolan Greig, which then meet with a variety of men who in the middle of the journey. Sometimes it is helpful, but not always. What do encounter bring? [The player will encounter many people on his journey. Some are helpful, some won't be. What will the each encounter bring?]

Search for Doran Grieg [Drangleic]  
Many obstacles confronting the destination of the player. Still to explore the esoteric terrain, to defeat the monsters are out there, I proceed one step at a time. The ...... to grab the answer. [Nothing interesting.]

Check (released January 16, 2014) 30 issue January 2014 Weekly Famitsu for more information! [Welp, looks like we only got info on the black-hair chick people thought was Velka. We'll learn more come January 16th!]"

Example of some armors and weapon guides: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4DB2A4E9731E3EA2

That said, Dark Souls tends to reward picking one weapon and upgrading it rather than constantly shedding your items for +1 versions.

UlgraTheTerrible,raisedbynarcissists,1389870514.0,"&gt; You only think about yourself. You don't love us.

Heh. My mom did the ""You don't love me"" thing *so often* that I really did stop loving her. I just stopped. I stopped caring about her bullshit. I don't hate her, either, for hate is still attention. I just don't fucking care. 

This is the easiest (and also hardest) way to deal with the anxiety. You don't get all that anxious over people you don't care about one way or the other. You don't get all that stressed about it. 

Look, if you need to, you can file for a restraining order and even get help from the police to get your stuff, but that usually isn't necessary. 

I just took what I absolutely needed, and that's it. You'd be surprised at how little you need. You can usually enlist the help of a friend or two to help move the essentials, and I find that *usually* N's won't act up in front of other people. 

The thing is, the best bet is to do your level best to *not* engage with their tactics. They feed off the power of upsetting you, and never is the advice ""Don't feed the trolls"" more pertinent and useful than dealing with N parents. You may still have to engage, but don't play to their agenda. You can vent here, after, if you need to. 

TL;DR: N's eat drama for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Don't feed them, and maybe they'll quit scratching at your door for food.

[Creator (of the original games) interview](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/leisure-suit-larry-creator-gaming-has-immatured/1100-6208025/)

ETA: I'm amused that we are judging ""books"" by their cover as part of an argument :D :D :D I'm sure that there are plenty of covers that made people think that let's say Buffy the Vampire Slayer was cheap fluff. Again, to my knowledge the 3d LSL games are indeed bad, so I don't think you are losing out on a great game by not buying it. But I still think that putting something on the list of worst game (rather than just worst cover) should maybe be based on a bit more than that. "

FarArdenlol,hiphopheads,1389871810.0,"**Flatbush Zombies** - as long as Eric can produce those kind of dark, spooky beats on which both Meech and Juice flow so well they can keep their fan base and expand beyond that a bit, nothing too big I'd say.

**Big KRIT** - *Cadillactica* will be produced by multiple people unlike his mixtapes which were primarily his beats, he needed more diversity so if they can pull that of on Cadillactica KRIT can blow up.

**Joey Bada$$** - It's *all in* with his next album. He's either going big or staying known only to hip hop fans.

**Chance The Rapper** - He just needs to drop another project on *Acid Rap* level and he'll become what Joey is now but with different sound and more chance to blow up because he can always hug more pop side of the music whereas Joey doesn't want.

**A$AP Rocky** - He needs similar production from *Live.Love*, beats like *Kissin' Pink*, *Acid Drip*, *Leaf*, etc. Also don't put much other A$AP collabs on album, I know it's his team and all but it's mostly wack verses from them. Maybe put Ferg and Ant on one song and that's it.

**Kendrick Lamar** - I doubt he can make *GKMC* level project as it's his *Illmatic* probably, but if he follows Nas path and drops at least *It Was Written* just like Nas did after *Illmatic* he will stay relevant.

I'm also enjoying Clara's character; I only wish she had more time with Eleventh, and that Eleventh had more time with his 7B costume.

And of course the first attraction is going to be physical, unless you have been takling or chatting without seeing eachother or pictures of eachother then the way you look is the first thing a guy will see.

However in my own experience if I'm not physically attracted to a woman immediately, that's not stopping me from talking to her and getting to know her. If she turns out to be a great person it's more likely that I will find aspects of her looks that I will become attracted by, if you understand what I'm trying to say.

predalienmack,AskMen,1389872838.0,"From my experience, taking girls on dates is easy because A, girls like it when someone offers to basically pay for their food, movie ticket, etc., so they are probably going to be friendly because of that, B, you are probably just getting to know them, so there are a ton of unrelated things to talk about that'll keep the conversation going, and C, if I'm taking a girl on a date, we probably know very little about each other's hobbies and preferences, so it's more engaging than normal to try to get a feel for those factors about a person in a date-related setting. 

The issue that curbs the potential to take the relationship further in my experience usually comes up in that ""C"" step. I'll learn a lot of cool things about a girl and what she likes to do, but I'll realize that I have virtually nothing in common with her in terms of hobbies, life goals, etc., so basically the only thing we'd have in common in a serious relationship is wanting to spend the free time we weren't spending on those other factors with each other, rather than having an interest in and wanting to do those things together as well. Personally, I suppose it doesn't help that I don't have a wide array of hobbies, either haha. 

For a lot of guys, I notice that their issue is their mindset, that they don't have the feeling that they're ""worth"" dating at that deeper level. While I do have that feeling of self worth, I just rarely meet any girls that appear to be worth the emotional commitment considering the lack of commonalities that would probably doom a relationship from the start. Having difficulties progressing into a serious relationship is a difficult situation to be in, no matter the root cause. I feel for ya, man!"

Perspective133,dayz,1389873716.0,"Okay, for the sake of this statement, let's not look at killing people as necessarily ""bad"", as odd as that sounds. For example, would an Allied soldier in WWII be wrong for killing a Nazi in combat? I'd say no.

To put it in a (very) broad perspective, there's really three kinds of people: Those who absolutely cannot bring themselves to kill someone under any circumstance, those who can do so in a given situation but will most likely suffer some psychological trauma, and those who can do so without any qualms about it. Sociopaths and serial killers as well as seasoned law enforcement or military personnel may both fall in to the third group, so let's not totally vilify those who can kill without mental repercussions. It really all depends on a person's psychological profile.

As I've also touched on in the first paragraph, killing someone is a very circumstantial thing. There's a huge difference between killing an innocent person and killing someone who, for lack of a better term, *really* needs killing. For example, I know I might have some mental repercussions if I was in Iraq and I had taken out someone who was clearly a suicide bomber right before the guy had the chance to detonate his vest and blow up a school full of kids, but in the end I'd know I made the right decision.

TL;DR - Killing is circumstantial, some can handle it and others can't, so the value of life is never an absolute."

Secret_Wizard,AskReddit,1389874108.0,"*The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*. The story of its main quest (there are plenty of side-stories to play through) just blows anything I've seen in other games out of the water.

To put it very, very simply, it turns out you're pretty much the prophesied anti-christ figure of the local religion. Ouch. A nation that already gives you the cold shoulder for simply being a foreigner now actively despises you (Go near a Temple, you're in for trouble!)... But the thing is, you're the only one that can save all of existence from a greater evil brewing within Red Mountain. Over the course of the story you pretty much march straight up to the faces of every political and religious leader on the island, including one of the three mortal Gods worshiped by the people, and slap sense into 'em to gain their trust and support.

Even the heretic Ashlanders who were supposed to support the Nerevarine (that's you) are against you, because you were supposed to be a native-born dark elf and not an outlander of some other race. The story just gets so crazy and intricate, and you can really just drink in this complex backstory and lore of a fictional race. The dialogues with Vivec (the aforementioned God) can last for like half an hour as you discuss the moral conflicts and plight of the land with him.

But mostly, ordering parts. Calling and asking where the parts are. When they'll arrive. You might do a bunch of data entry, like logging metered hours on equipment, or checking inspection sheets.

I'm male but I'm atypical as far as CS students go.

edisraw1,WritingPrompts,1389876039.0,"I never meant for this to happen. That is probably my mantra now. My name is James Elkins. I guess I'm a scientist but I don't really know what being is now. On June 7th, 2016 I discovered...I was allowed to discover the human race is without control of it's destiny. I don't really know how to describe it to someone. I guess fate is more than real. Fate is it's own entity and it's had us by the balls for so long it drug us from primordial ooze to a digital world just to pull the carpet right under our feet...and the worst part is we'll never have a chance to forget. Fate is here now and it needs to be known.

""Watch out, dickhead!"" My brakes screeched I stopped everything was meant to be okay I guess.

""Does it even matter?"" Fate has clearly given up on this man. It was ready to let him die and he knew it. It was ready to let me stop him. It was ready to let me give him a second chance.

""Of course it matters!""

""How so?""

""It'll matter of I'm stuck cleaning my grill again. Buying new headlights.""

""Then it was meant to be.""

""Cut that shit out and get in the car.""

""....Okay.""

""That's more like it you sad sack.""

The man reminded me of myself. I was hired into my job at NASA despite a horrible work ethic, A pension for booze, and a head of what I assumed were my own ideals. They said I was a genius. It didn't matter. I had a gift. I guess they were right. This guy reeked of stale gin and freedom. The only thing that mattered to him was being his own man. The only thing that mattered to him was taken away. He had soft eyes.

""So what's your trade?""

""Transient.""

""It seems like that's gotten pretty popular. Surprised you could find a gig.""

""There is a lot of turn over.""

As of June 6th, 2016 there were about 1.7 million deaths a year by suicide. As of June 6th, 2017 there are 16.3 million deaths a year by suicide. I guess fate decided to have a crisis of being. Essentially it went like this the third world the underdeveloped the downtrodden stayed the same. People just have lives in places like that. But here in the land of the free, in the land of money and corruption we were devastated at a social level. When you figure out your dreams are predetermined you either strap in and live or you melt down and die and most people chose the latter. I don't know if it was fate...but only because im not privilege to that knowledge.

""So whats up with you, Good Samaritan?
 
""I guess I'm a transient too...I used to be an theoretical physicist for NASA.""

Texas is weird in winter. People thinks it doesn't get cold in the south. It does, a bitter chill that hits you like bolt of lighting. There was nothing but time and dessert in front of us and even though we were silent for the next few hours I couldn't help but think it felt better not being alone.

""I was a deli manager.""

""Well, I can see why you are in such an existential crisis now.""

""It isn't about the job. Or the money, or even my life as a whole.""

""No?""

""No.""

""Then what is it about?""

""Control. Whether I had it or not I probably would've lived and died the same as far as work goes and potential goes. But there are some things you wish you could have changed. And now you realize it was ruined before you started.""

""Like what?""

""My daughter. She was hit by a truck outside our apartment. Her mother had been gone off with another man, started another family, probably hanging off a noose somewhere now. But she was still here. She was mine and when it happened...I told her to go outside and play. So for the longest time I knew the truth was I could've done something different I would've done something different. I was at peace with that. Now I know I am just fates bitch. The next time I roll the dice, go to sleep, sneeze if it ruins me, if it makes me a king, if it kills me it has no meaning.""

""You still are living it.""

""No! That isn't fucking living! It's virtual reality at best. It's predetermined to a T and if I change my mind at the last minute that was in the cards too. A fucking merry-go round.""

""Your merry-go-round.""

""My hell!""

""Can you grab me that black bag?""

""Yea sure.""

""You see this? This is going to change it all back.""

""A camera? How?""

""You'll see.""

""Where are we going?""

""Tuscon.""

""The hell I am!""

""You don't even have a choice.""

As we pulled into Tuscon we were met with the ghostly images of what used to be a modest city. It was was so little now. Merely a testament to a mistake. It was where we found fate one year ago.

""Why are we here.""

""To turn it back.""

""How?""

""You'll see.""

""Why because your shitty organization found fate you can turn it back?""

""It wasn't just my shitty organization. It was me."" 

""What?""

""I made the algorithm, I told them where to dig, It chose me. I discovered fate. I went out of my way to find it.""

""Why!?""

""It was a theory then. It was a pipe dream. Nothing more nothing less, it was supposed to be another Hand of God. But for Earth. Our Hand of God!""

""Why did they let you dig!? It's so far from air and space.""

""They didn't have a choice in it.""

We walked for a few miles. The town no longer felt eerie. When I first was here it felt like a nightmare, now it just feels like home. The hole still sat glowing it's fierce glow.

""Hand me the camera.""

""Let's go.""

""No. Just me. I need you to stay here.""

""Why?""

""To tell the story.""

As I trekked down the hole it became real again. I lacked fear I had no use for it any longer. There was fate I wanted to say I found it beautiful but I didn't know if I controlled that emotion.

""*You're back, James*""

""I am.""

""*You want me gone?*""

""I need you gone.""

""*I know. You'll have to die here.*""

""Understood.""

""*What do you want to know before?*""

""Are you really fate? Do we have any control?""

""*You know I am. I proved it to the world. You have no control. No one does. This is life as I planned it for you.*""

""Why have you done what you have done.""

""*I apologize. It was a social experiment.*""

""So why did you let it happen.""

""*I apologize I had no control. Turn on the camera.""

""Wait.""

""*Yes?*""

""Fate can't control itself.""

""*Does it feel like it can? Turn it on. 

Humanity, I am not fate. I am indescribable to your spices, but I promise you I only control those that let me. You gave your pathetic lives to me thinking I determined them. You were fools and now you are learnt. This man is your last sacrifice to me. Go live your lives.*"" 

""Will they believe you?""

""*They'll believe what they wish to. I must go now.*""

""Where?""

""*It is not of importance. Good bye.*""

The flash was bright and the burn intense. I was dying. I needed to I couldn't hold this secret and live a full life. Fate knew this. It gave a gut shot and enough strength to make back to the man with the dead daughter. His could now be in peace.

""Here. The truth.""

""No it isn't.""

""How do you know?""

""I followed you down the hole I heard it all.""

""Why would you do that?""

""I didn't have a choice.""

""Will you tell them?""

""No.""

I would've apologized but blackness crept in. He had soft eyes."

eighthgear,anime,1389876129.0,"Well, I don't know if I would say that I enjoyed this week's episode as much as the last. It just seemed a bit, well, slower, in my mind. Some things were a it dragged out (like the bizarre alien obsession that the show seems to have). Still, it was quite funny, and we got some interesting developments - Hakuya and Kobeni's past history together was clearly more deep than what it was first let on to be, and that could explain why Hakuya is going along with the whole arranged marriage affair (as opposed to him simply accepting it without question). Hakuya likely has proper feelings for Kobeni, as were hinted to in the first episode. This is a welcome development, since it makes Hakuya into a more realistic character, as opposed to simply being some hick from the sticks who simply accepts tradition without question. Also, we were formally introduced to a new character, Kashima Nadeshiko, the student council VP. Benio's eccentricities were getting a bit excessive, so it is good to have a character capable of reigning her in.

As much as I like Mashiro, she has been given quite a large part of the spotlight in the show so far. Of course, this episode was a Mashiro-centric one by design, and based on the title of next week's episode - ""I Can Feel the RomCom Waves"" - we should be seeing more of the relationship between Kobeni and Hakuya. This is a good thing.

Oh, and in fairness to Mashiro, royal milk tea and scones sound *very* appealing. Royal milk tea is a bit of a gimmick - the name was basically invented for advertising purposes - but it is properly good. I had some the last time I was in Tokyo. I should really learn how to make the stuff at home.

Basilgate,WritingPrompts,1389876769.0,"The woman in the bar laughed, biting a nail as she leaned in closer to him. Jonah said all the right things, in all the right ways. Seduction was a game, and he’d been playing for a very long time.

“How old would you say I am?” he asked.

“Oh, I dunno... Twenty... seven?”

He smiled.

Back at his house, the woman rode Jonah with wild passion, her lithe, athletic body slick with sweat. He looked up at her, and yawned. She slapped him and left. *What was her name?* he thought, as the front door slammed.

In a library, somewhere in what had once been America, he was reading. Frustrated, he put the book away after immediately realising he’d read it before. He looked over and saw a young student reading one of the books he’d written, under a different name. It had won various awards and accolades back then.

It was night. A city, somewhere. It was raining. He was in a fight. *There was a man in Laos,* he thought, as he dodged a meaty fist, *said I was cursed*. He found it strange that he should remember that, when all else had mixed together, like so much fruit in a blender. The assailant hit him across the face, a poor punch. Jonah felt a faint sting of annoyance. The man shouted something and came at him again. Jonah dodged and broke his jaw, and decided to leave him with a little internal haemorrhaging as well. He chose not to kill him.

A girl laughed and ran with him towards a rushing river, racing past trees and over rocks. She’d never felt so alive, she said. Then she was dead.

A war broke out. It was the third he’d fought in... no, the fourth. He killed men then. He often became a hero in one country, and a villain in another. Sometimes he was worshipped as a God, sometimes a celebrity. Whenever his fame would become too great, he’d change his face and name, and leave.

He was Anton now, and a building had collapsed. An earthquake. It had always been his greatest fear, and he knew it would happen one day. He screamed until his voice was spent, and then there was only the darkness and the silence. He reflected on his life; the women he’d been with, the destruction he’d seen, the rise and the fall of nations, and of men. The patterns, all the same. People, life, it all repeated itself. Nothing was new, nothing exciting, nothing, nothing. There was nothing. Anton thought of the man from Laos again and understood now, more than ever, how truly cursed he was.

A hundred years later, excavators pulled a madman from an old ruin. No one understood how it was possible. 

A lunatic shambled through the desert of the old world. The war to end all wars had ravaged the earth and left only stragglers. The survivors knew to avoid him, knew the stories of the dead-eyed immortal wraith, who killed all he came across. 

Silence again. The world was dead. Nothing lived. Only the madman. Staring at the stars.

The sun was massive in the sky, and would have burnt away his flesh if such a thing could happen. He did not even go blind. Only stood, hunched like some ancient vulture, as his world was filled with terrible light.

Darkness. Only darkness, but for the stars all about him. No stars within him, though, no light and no hope. Only darkness. Only dark and wretched and eternal life."

Alarm set for 6:50 and if I don't get out of bed immediately I won't get out of bed.

In the car for 6:55 after getting a drink (by my bed) and getting dressed.

In the pool by 7:15 and swim until 7:45.

Shower / dress / brush teeth / shave (if required) / do hair etc by 8:05 and back in the car by latest 8:10 as the drive back home can take anywhere from 10-25 minutes depending on traffic. Usually 15 mins but need to be safe.

Estre,languagelearning,1389877946.0,"Vad kul att du vill lära dig svenska :).

/r/svenska is a good place to start. Also, search on this subreddit, there have been a number of posts on the Swedish language in the past.

I would recommend using the resources on the sidebar of /r/svenska, then once you've got a nice enough handle on the grammar just find people to talk to (there's a skype group for that very purpose, for instance) and learn more vocabulary, perhaps on memrise- there are some nice lists on there that I've found useful (there's an app too). In addition, try to read and watch movies or TV in Swedish on a regular basis (SVTplay has a very nice free app!). It's not a difficult language and it's quite fun to learn, provided you put in the time of course.

By the way, I recently found bokus.com where Swedish books are plentiful and inexpensive, even after international shipping. Once you are able to read enough, get yourself some nice books (for example try Bröderna Lejonhjärta which is a well known children's classic) and get reading.

If there's something in particular you're looking for, I may know about it so just ask more specifically.

capitlj,AskReddit,1389878013.0,"Let me preface my post by saying I'm not a car salesman so I'm probably breaking the rules, I'm that kind of rebel :-) but I sold auto parts for two major chains and one local outfit for 10+ years so I have a little to offer here. 
With used cars it really helps to know a mechanic or a good counterman at a parts store. I say good because one of the major chains I worked for had the philosophy that if you know how to navigate a web browser you're a counterman. Some of the people that work at auto parts stores are little more than trained monkeys. 
That said a good counterman will know which makes/models/engines they sell the most parts for and have common issues. Some are simple like GM's legendary 3.8 v6 and it notorious intake leaks and the crappy plastic coolant elbows. Also which commonly replaced parts are the most expensive the ""multi-port"" injection systems on the 96 to 2000 GM 350's and 4.3's can cost upward of $800.  Any decent mechanic will also know these issues.  
Forums are usually a pretty good resource for these issues tho some of them are intimidating and difficult to navigate to find the info you want. Most will gladly respond to the ""I'm thinking of buying such and such car anything to watch out for?"" posts.  Some will flame you and tell you to search the forum for previous posts and/or look through the stickied posts.
My point is do your research and if you have a used or high mileage car when you need parts it's often cheapest to buy it online, but if you find a good counterman you can trust get the stuff from him and when you're looking at another purchase he'll gladly offer advice on what to look out for and which ones to outright avoid, I'm looking at you Audi's 2.7 twin turbo V6.

Putting more things in won't put you any closer to making bread, but if you start with the basic flour, yeast, sugar, etc.you can make some decent bread. From then on, you can diversify into sourdough, or rye, or even try things like pound cake and muffins once you get a feel for how different mixtures bake."

Neither of us know what goes on behind the scenes so lets both stop with this hatred. 


I'm sorry, but it just sounds like you're rattling off a bunch of sound bites and nothing more substantial then that. Nothing I said was really addressed in your response. I admit what I wrote was barbed and partisan, but those are issues nonetheless.

I_FUCK_UP_RECIPES,AskReddit,1389879683.0,"Except that's not how anyone thinks.  Because regardless of reality,  the perception is this:

Almost every guy wants to sleep with a girl on the first date, and a significantly smaller handful of girls want to sleep with a guy on the first date.  Those girls already slept with every *other* guy they met on the first date too, so there is no reason for you to get exclusive with them.  Just keep sleeping with them until you meet someone you like more.  

I'm married and 27, my wife (25) was a virgin when we met and I had to wait over a year.  I was willing to wait--and during that time become exclusive with her--because I figured, ""everyone else had to also and nobody else made the cut.""  I was quite far from being a virgin, and many of the girls who'd slept with me right away became FWBs.  Zero became girlfriends.  

I think part of why is also when you sleep with someone right away as a guy, you tend to assume there must be something wrong with her, and keep your eyes peeled for it; whereas when you are still trying to sleep with her you tend not to see her faults as readily because you're just thinking about sex.  Maybe it's just the not thinking about sex that lets you see their faults.  I don't know.  I just know that I had ruled them out very early on as girlfriend material for reasons completely separate from the fact that we fucked right away.    

The opposite seems to be true for women--the girls who put out right away dealt with my refusal to commit, my anger, my bad driving, etc far more willingly than my wife ever would.  And so I became a better man for her."

10/10 game, and now is the time to get into it. Dark Souls II comes out in about two months!

The game is mostly a solo game, however you can connect to and play with others. However, you risk being invaded by enemy players randomly as you go along if you're human, which is the only way to connect to others. The only way to stop these invasions is defeat the boss of the area, but you also cut off helpful summoned players by doing this.

However it is a very difficult game to learn, but once you do learn it you'll enjoy it. I haven't met anyone that hasn't learned how to play the game that doesn't get immersed. Read through [this](http://i.imgur.com/QXNVwLa.jpg) and you'll do fine."

I talk to them while i put my gear on for the brief ride home. At the time, my bike had really loud, fire-breathing pipes and roared when you open the throttle a bit.

So as i'm leaving and feeling a bit of bravado, i clutch up (accidentally) and blast off into a power wheelie IN THE PARKING LOT. Managed to get it back down before i needed to slow and turn.

I was probably not in the best shape to ride, but i did it anyway.

I got away with it that night, but i don't ride at night or to bars. i won't try that move again, though.

In any case, my bike is a classic styled bike, so i usually just get old men following me and telling me their triumph stories. Pretty sure everyone above a certain age has one. I've had people follow me off the interstate while my bike was on the trailer, just to pull up next to me at the pump and say, ""Nice Bike."" I usually tell them about it and ask them if they ride, if they say, ""no, not anymore"" i suggest that the present is always the best time to start again.

no chicks in this story, but badass, sure.

So i was riding home from work and decided to take the less traveled local streets, which happen to run past some projects near Fisk University. So as i'm rolling down the road. Some kid (8-10yrs) jumps out from behind a wall next to the sidewalk and act like he's throwing his skateboard in front of me. 

I assume he has been doing this for laughs all day and his younger brother is standing there watching him cause trouble. In any case, i wasn't blowing through, so i was able to see, react, and slow, but then my ""ghetto instincts"" kicked in, and i looked 360 to make sure someone wasn't coming up behind me in an ambush. Nothing doing, it's just this punk having a laugh, but he could have dismounted me if i had been going the speed limit (not posted anyway) and panic braked wrong.

so i stare at him behind my gold mirror visor and roll past, then turn up a street, doubleback down an alley, and come up behind him and his brother as he is setting up for the next car. The little brother sees me, drops chin. big eyes surprised. I blip my throttle, the triple roars and the punk turns, sees me, takes it in, and now he's scared. I look at him, point at my eyes, point at him, then gun it and ride off.. LIKE A BADASS."

Personally, I prefer the grocery store flowers, like carnations. I like getting flowers, but they die. And I certainly don't want my man spending big bucks on roses when they will just die. Carnations can be cheap, smell delicious (as many roses now come without smell...why????) and they last a super long time compared to other flowers. But some women really like roses. So as I mentioned previously, I'd wing it this time and ask her what she likes for next time."

The belongings of neither sex are more or less important than any others. The important thing should be who the child is and who the ancestor was.  

For example: If there's only 1 child born to receive such a box, then they get it all. But OP has a sister. So she gets a box of items. That's lovely. But what if she is specifically into something that one of her ancestors, male or female, was also into that her brother is not? What if she's a writer and the OP is, say, an engineer.  I bet that script would mean more to her.  Or if his younger sibling was a brother and a writer, then it would mean more to that little brother.  

What I was trying to say is that it shouldn't matter what came from who or that only a male or female gets this or that.  There should be more thought.

But yes, I agree that all the children should receive something and not just the firstborn.  But maybe you should rethink some of your statements.

It honestly sounds like you've found the best possible solution to meet your own needs/desires while staying in the boundaries of a monogamous relationship. True, porn can become an addiction, but unless you're looking at it for hours at a time, or frequently choosing porn over sex with your girlfriend, you're probably not an addict.

Even then, Snape doesn't do a lot of that. Most of his punishments are standard teacher care even in the US: detentions, losing house points, staying after class, etc. Hardly anything that deserves the term ""abuse""

Remember that America is awful to teachers. We back-bite teachers pretty often for students who underperform because of their own flaws.

bananaruth,todayilearned,1389882110.0,"Are you purposefully ignoring all the points I'm making?

I'm not saying ""women are cheated by the political system unlike anyone else"". Just merely pointing out that it is a problem that affects women and therefore an important problem that women (like everyone else) should be informed about. If, as you claim there are more woman voters, then it is disproportionately a women's problem. Especially if you take into account that example you gave that won Obama points with women, that really said nothing. If women are being pandered to more than men in the political process, then being cheat by the system is even more relevant to women.

I agree that women are pandered more to than men, I just don't think it as dramatic as you stated. A person will naturally support causes that are in their interest. A male candidate will support interests that are relevant to him and thus by extension to other males. Therefore, they don't really need to campaign for men's votes. Now say Hillary Clinton were running, she'd already have the support of a large number of women (I personally can't stand her), so she'd probably have to focus more on attracting male voters. 

&gt;To be clear, there is nothing to do to fix the wage gap, as it is due to personal choices women make differently than men.

I slightly disagree with this. In fact, there is only a small gap in wages on average I believe. Any gaps there are probably are a result of personal choice, but why are those choices being made? Do the women making these choices feel that they have a choice? What exactly are the choices that they have? For instance, for many women, it's cheaper to quit work and stay at home than pay for daycare. You don't see many men doing this. Is it because the men in their lives are making more money? Is it because the men don't want to stay at home (or perhaps society tells them they shouldn't)? Personal choices are tricky things. I give kids personal choices all the time i.e.: ""Do you want to wear the red shirt or the blue shirt?"" They'll pick every time, but maybe they wanted to wear the yellow shirt.

I brought up rape as an example. It was relevant in context of what I was saying. Don't be purposefully dull. You seem to want uniquely women problems, and that almost exclusively affects women.

&gt;If you have problems with individual politicians who are failing to represent you, don't discuss this as if it is a systemic problem that needs a solution on a systemic level. 

Wrong. That's not what I said. He is merely an example that recently made the news. It is a systematic problem. It just seemed like you didn't even bother to look over the link I sent. Also, I dunno if I'm feminist or not, but reddit sure has made me more so. I see so much hate towards women and just completely reprehensible attitudes. 

&gt;And finally, do you think doctors use empathy as a tool when they treat patients? 

Nope. I also don't expect congressmen to wear scrubs. I'm not talking about doctors or attorneys. I'm also not talking about huge amounts of empathy, like you seem to be suggesting. I'm saying, that a small amount of empathy is important. The amount that would make you think, ""Gee, the homeless problem *is* a problem. It must be terrible, we should do something about that."" and not ""Yeah, homeless people. I've seen the numbers before. They should just get jobs. They're lazy and all addicted to drugs. Leave them there. What's the next issue you wanted to talk about?"" I'm not talking about campaign promises or election time rhetoric, but what they think when it comes time to vote on or create bills. That's what really matters.

No, empathy is not a requirement for helping other people, but it helps. A serial killer can do nice things. My uncle is a sociopath who killed people's pets when he robbed their homes (bird in the microwave, dead dog etc.). He got me a christmas present one time. (Especially shocking considering I think the crime he was actually imprisoned for was stealing from and burning down churches.) But guess what? All my relatives who were not soulless demons gave me presents every year when I was little. (His present wasn't great either, it was a kid's cassette with songs based on your name and the one he gave me had my name spelled incorrectly.) So no, empathy is not necessary, but a small amount gives better quality help and a better understanding of the problem.

There's a particular event that I find profoundly arousing. It's the moment a woman catches sight of her body in the mirror and awakens to herself as an instrument of pure erotic pleasure. She admires the curves, the lines, the texture of the skin. As she caresses herself, she sees the way the figure in the mirror responds: with flushed skin, goosebumps, tingling hot electricity jolting through her body. She sees herself as nymph, seductress, succubus. And then all thought fades as she is compelled to pursue pleasure wherever it leads.

Occasionally this moment is captured in a photograph. Sometimes I see it, sometimes I think I can just make it out. Other times I see the same picture and see only a pose, and I am disappointed.

Here you will find an assortment of lovely women who are approaching that point of surrender, or who have reached it and surrendered to their own erotic potential. I hope you enjoy the albums.

If you have questions, always err on the side of caution. You can't change your air filter too many times.

So for instance, it says to inspect the transmission fluid at 60k miles. I would  drain and refill the transmission with new fluid at that point, as 60k is near the end of transmission fluids usefulness before it starts getting old and broken down.

Seems pretty spot on to me. For example:

&gt;**60,000 miles or 72 months**

&gt;Inspect the following:

&gt;__ Automatic transmission fluid

&gt;__ Ball joints and dust covers

&gt;__ Brake lines and hoses


&gt;__ Drive belts 


&gt;__ Drive shaft boots

&gt;__ Engine coolant 

&gt;__ Exhaust pipes and mountings

Try being less judgmental. Try listing things you do not know about the situation and tell yourself it's ok to find out gradually.

Johnzsmith,Metal,1389882951.0,"I would say things were different in the 80s. I really looked forward to And Justice and thought it was a good record. It fit well with the evolution of their sound. The video for One was huge. I personally did not see that video as being a sell out point, but instead I saw it as wider acceptance of a good band. Hell, King Diamond, Megadeth, and Nuclear Assault all had videos on Mtv at the time. It was a great time for metal. 



That being said there was a lot of promotion leading up to the Black Album. I was a little skeptical, but fuck, it was METALLICA! Those dudes were the LAST band that would think of selling out. Then I heard Enter Sandman for the first of 1000000000 times. I was totally underwhelmed. I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't that. That was too clean, too polished. It just didn't have *something*. After getting the album and listening to it, it was obvious that this wasn't the next awesome Metallica album, it was some calculated effort to make money. 


There is a fine line between wanting your favorite band to be successful and being considered sellouts.  Metallica crossed that line with The Black Album. It's a good album (mostly) but it's not a good Metallica album. It was the start of their climb to being considered the biggest sellouts in metal. Now a days they have been considered sellouts for over TWICE AS LONG as they were considered a great metal band, and that is kind of sad. 

I guess if the change had been more gradual it wouldn't be as big of deal, but they became so huge so fast based off of one radio friendly album that it is difficult to see them as anything else but sellouts. I hope that helps clear up the perceptions of Metallica from someone that was there for the change.

silvinci,javascript,1389883297.0,"They can't answer it, because this code is total bollocks.
It is totally unnecessary to wrap this function up in the style of the revealing module pattern. It makes the code hard to understand. If you really want encapsulate something, create a proper module that exports something like ""Set"".

State-ful functions are also an anti-pattern. Use a proper Object for that. Or at least expose the array as a static.

Also optimising for speed is bs. Every interpreter works differently. You would have to do actual code tests.

I would probably never use a function like this, but out of scope, this is the cleanest, sanest and probably fastest approach.

    function didWeHave(item) {
      if(~didWeHave.set.indexOf(item)) return true;
      didWeHave.set.push(item);
      return false;
    }
    didWeHave.set = [];

I refuse to use your weird closure tweak.

You should not test for code monkeys. You should test for people who think like you. See if they adhere to your coding standards. In general tests are lame. Talk to people and check the work they've already done. You're not coding for stupid tests, you're coding for real world problems. And in case this test represents your style, I would probably quit before even finishing the test.

Edit: code is acutally correct."

The USPS is really a hit or miss service.  I think by and large FedEx cares a little bit less as to what is inside the package (as they are paid more, and also ship a greater variety of items like batteries, liquids, dangerous goods, etc).

This guy in some '94 POS, who tailgated me on the main road, turns in behind me and proceeds to tailgate me as i roll at 25mph to my house. Then right as i'm going to turn left into my house, he starts to try to pass me... 

Well, just before turning in, i see him in the left mirror, but i realize i'm seeing the wrong headlight and that he's passing. Lightning decision time! I keep turning and get out from in front of him, which was faster than cutting back the other way, since i was already committed to turn into my driveway. 

Yes, i know i should have turned with checking, but WHO PASSES ON A 1000' LONG DEAD END street w/ parking on both sides and no lines. There's not even enough room for two cars to pass between parked cars, one has to wait it out in an empty space. drug dealers down the street in a rental unit; live in the city and you have to deal with it, so there are often people coming and going, especially on the 1st of the month, regular paydays, and friday.

So i straighten up, lock the wheels, and skid to a stop. Rev the piss out of the motor (i'm obviously angry). In any case, now i am blocking this guy. I take off my helmet (fyi, that means i'm ready to beat someones ass with it) and dress this asshat down bad. 

""Where you trying to pass? Do you see a passing lane? Why were you tailgating me? Do you think that's ok? Are you trying to kill me? If you are, you better just hop out right now and try again. What's that? You're sorry? There are kids on this street that jump out behind cars ALL THE TIME. WTF ASSHOLE?!?""

I tell him I have cameras in my house aimed to pick up every license plate and car that runs up and down the road. Then i tell him that i know he doesn't live on the street and i ""know"" why he's here and that if i see him again, i'm calling the cops on him and his dealers after i block the street with my car and trailer. 

""Now beat it, fuckwad!"", turned, plunked helmet back on, hopped back on bike and road my bike up my driveway."

When I see short women (like &lt;5'5"" or so) who have good fashion, I think, ""Wow, she can wear that outfit/ shoes without getting comments and without standing out like a sore thumb.  Awesome for her!  I kinda wish I was short so I could do that.""  Then the moment passes.  I get especially jealous if the short, fashionable lady is also overweight, because on her, she looks cute and cuddly.  On me, I look like a giant ogre (albeit a cute ogre).  

For guys, they all feel short (to me) when they're boob height.  I don't really think about them negatively until they try for a hug or something.  A hug with a boob height person is really awkward, and with guys I feel like they're just trying to get a face full of boob, rather than offer comfort or friendship or whatever hugs are really for.  I kinda get resentful of guys who try to do that.  Other than that, I don't think about the person negatively or positively in terms of height.  "

I'm giving you a rough idea here, but figuring a box that is 15"" x 12"" x 11"", and weighs about 10lbs,  going from Sydney to Rhode Island (my location) would cost roughly $263 at the FedEx list rate (list rates are crazy, I have an account and I get 79% discount on exports, less on imports though).

Compare this to the USPS price (for the exact same box) being $78.30.  


The reason for such a differential is really the service breakdown.  What you are paying for with FedEx is for a fedex employee to load your package onto a FedEx plane, take it to a FedEx location in another country, and for finally a FedEx driver to deliver it for you.  The tracking system is superb, and they notify you if there are any issues.  With the USPS, however, once it leaves the country, it is in the hands of the destination Postal Service.  Sometimes the tracking works, sometimes it doesn't.  If there is a problem with the package and it needs to be returned to the sender, sometimes it can take months."

FeatherDie,AskWomen,1389885388.0,"Yes. I like compliments because reinforcing the idea that someone likes different things about me improves my feelings about the relationship.


I understand that not everyone expresses their appreciation and love in the same ways. Often people adopt certain things early on in the relationship that they actually aren't comfortable with to TRIPLE MAKE SURE that the person doesn't leave them behind. Then, when the relationship is solid they stop doing those things. 

It's not wrong to ask for compliments in your relationship. It's never a bad idea to discuss what things make you both feel loved, valued, sexy, happy, or upset. It should bring you closer together as a couple unless one of the partners is actively working against the relationship. 

Sometimes I just ask for what I'd like to hear to be honest. ""My ass looks great today babe. You should agree with me."" - Cue sexual comment from sexy SO. Mission accomplished."

friedpikmin,AskReddit,1389885683.0,"This is 100% true. I interned at one of those ""Best Places to Work"" companies. On the surface, it looks like such a wonderful place to be. There were video game systems in the break rooms, multiple onsite dining locations, an onsite Starbucks, two fully equipped gyms, jogging trails and basketball courts on the outside, amazing artwork and sculptures around the building, etc. But if you dig deeper, it's not as glorious as it sounds. Everyone has a cubicle, you have to follow strict corporate procedures when getting work done, and most employees actually worked longer hours. It wasn't necessarily a bad place to work.. they also gave you bonuses at the end of the year, tuition reimbursement, and the company is highly respected. But I guess I would say after interning there for two summers, it just felt overrated.

Now I work in a place that looks like a dump on the surface. But the atmosphere is totally relaxed.

Even other folks. You certainly spoke something that wasn't true when you claimed that Joseph didn't have sex with his wives. This is pretty well documented historical fact.

Mandreotti,StonerProTips,1389885727.0,"&gt;Possession by consumption is a charge **governed by state laws**, which vary by state. Such statutes are aimed at deterring underage alcohol consumption by minors. They typically use a lower blood alcohol content level than necessary for a charge of intoxication to prove that an underage drinker possessed alcohol.

&gt;The following is an example of a state statute dealing with possession by consumption:
 
&gt;Any person under the age of twenty-one years, who purchases or attempts to purchase, or has in his or her possession, **any intoxicating liquor as defined in section 311.020 or who is visibly intoxicated as defined in section 577.001, RSMo, or has a detectable blood alcohol content of more than two-hundredths of one percent or more by weight of alcohol** in such person's blood is guilty of a misdemeanor.

So how does this apply? From what the article says, this is used for charging minors for alcohol consumption. Is there more that this article isn't giving, or did I completely miss something?"

tallgirl32,ptsd,1389886318.0,"I did a major research project in school about PE therapy. It is incredibly gnarly and painful, but it works. Definitely look into somewheretrumpets's suggestions, but if you decide to continue on this path, know that this technique has been incredibly effective for a lot of people. I have read study after study (after study! It was a big project.) of people pronouncing *themselves* ""completely healed"" from incredible and horrific trauma after completing PE. I don't know what you have been through, but can imagine it is something pretty major if EMDR, CBT, meds, etc. have not helped. I look at PE as extreme measures for extreme situations, and it sounds like you may be in one of those situations. 

I would highly, highly recommend that you begin using E.F.T. (Emotional Freedom Technique). It takes about five minutes to learn, is free, you can do it anywhere, and it is one of the most powerful tools available for dealing with trauma and negative thoughts, feelings and emotions. My own therapist/mentor is one of the absolute rock stars of trauma therapy in the U.S., versed in every scientific and spiritual technique imaginable, and she believes that E.F.T. can resolve almost anything if used consistently. There are hundreds of videos and websites that will teach you about it, so I would just look it up. I think that E.F.T. will help you a great deal in handling the things that come up for you as you go through the PE. I don't know that I would use it *during* your therapy, as it may be counterproductive. I'm not sure, I have never read or heard of them being combined that I can remember. But CERTAINLY afterwards to help process your experience. And any time you need it, really. It truly is a remarkable tool to have in your emotional toolbox. 

I really do wish you all the best, and I would love to know how you are doing with this in the future. Please feel free to PM me if you ever want to. Good luck, and keep breathing. (No, really...big, deep breaths. We so often forget how important our breathing is!)

I can agree with the masses. A coupe with this engine and RWD would be redonkulous.

Willravel,StarWars,1389886332.0,"I still think the gameplay of *Star Wars Battlefront* is some of the best I've played. It's highly intuitive, rewarding new players with responding really well, but it's also complex enough to where experienced players could get a lot out of it. The maps were really well laid out and the art design was great for a PS2 game, too. The jet trooper was perhaps just slightly too powerful, but in multiplayer there were always foils for that. 

Honestly, if we're getting a new Battlefront game, I'd simply like *Star Wars Battlefront* with updated graphics (1080p), a few new maps, and the ability to design maps. I don't even need the Jedi/Sith or space battles from *Star Wars Battlefront 2*, though the single player story with the 501st was pretty neat. 

I worry with modern AAA war games, that there'd be the temptation to do too much with the game (or inject it with that special, weird brand of paranoid jingoism that's infected a lot of modern shooters). ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" is a good policy. "

Not by a long shot.

True.  But the situation you presented is exceedingly rare.  There's more value in knowing whether the 2 pointer was good earlier.  If you go for 2 on the first TD and miss, you're still down 2 scores and you need to kick onsides.  If you take the point, force a 3 and out, score a TD and miss the 2 point you're probably boned.

if you are older and have had few long term relationships (like myself) you will likely, but not necessarily, have a higher number.

there really is no way to pin down what is average or ""normal"".

i've been with men who have had way more partners than me. and my last relationship was with a virgin, so i've seen all sides of this equation and to me it is a complete non-issue. the only way is affects me is if i meet someone who feels my number is too high."

And not just race based either. Finch defends the wrongly accused, but in that society's code where the white man is unassailable, he must do so by attacking the accuser's status as a poor, uneducated female. He does so with brutal efficiency, bringing her sexual morals into question and implying that she is the product (biologically or behaviorally) of an incestuous household.

Finch can move the world to save a wrongly accused black man, but he had to throw an illiterate, impoverished woman under the wheels to do it. In an unjust society, the disenfranchised turn on each other more easily than against the privileged."

The only thing this doesn't apply to is a high slag chance SMG like the Slagga or the Florentine, whose level matters less than the ridiculous amount of slag rounds they put out, a lvl 50 Florentine has been getting me through fairly well.  

Other than that, EVERYTHING YOU OWN should be at your level or within one or two levels of yours, because scaling in UVHM is deadly. Using a Dahl sniper at the proper level I was able to go through Sawtooth Cauldron with very few hiccups, whereas using a lower level Lyuda I was having a very hard time. Start getting legendaries now, but farm for them when you hit the level cap, otherwise go through the game like a normal playthrough, pick up more powerful equipment as you go, it will be more fun and not nearly as annoying.

If you like sniping stick with it, it can end up doing truck loads of damage when you stack Critical Ascension with damage from other passive bonuses, slag, and Decepti0n.

Don't be afraid to respec. Try something new each time you leave Sanctuary and see what works best for you. For me using a Sniping/SMG build is the most fun and I die much less than a pure sniping or melee class.

But, I'm just not comfortable with that. Also I think especially younger people get a whole other idea of What is normal and what isn't.

They're usually pretty sloppy with their ""targeted assassinations"", as well. I guess the dead ""collateral"" have only themselves to blame that the ""targets"" live around other Palestinians? 

&gt; Well I can see you don't have a bias at all.

Because you're some paragon of impartiality and objectivity.

&gt; How do you feel about the fact that other Arab countries don't allow Gazans in either?

DERP DURR DA ARAB COUNTRIES ARE WORSE DOO HOO HOO.

Your comment doesn't make any sense. You want the other Arab nations to take the Gazans so Israel can start putting ""settlers"" in the Gaza strip again?

Last I checked, Arab countries aren't the ones dropping chemical weapons on Gaza, no.

Doesn't mean that I said ""All the Arab countries have operated in the proper way in regard to the Palestinians"", but the problem was created by Israeli action. The biggest issue for Palestinians in Palestine comes from the Israelis and Israeli actions.

&gt; Are they helping the product of hatred?

Why don't you up the ante and outright accuse me of hating DA JOOS?

&gt; Ya, because Hamas is the greatest thing that has ever happened to the Gazans.

Are you an idiot? They have Hamas, which won because Fatah has been going through a shitty period, and especially because the ""peace process"" as defined by Israel wasn't going anywhere, and Palestinians kept getting shat on.

Does Israel do anything for the Gazans but shoot farmers and fishermen and anyone at the border fence, as well as dropping white phosphorus on them or starving them? 

Because I'm not seeing anything else, plus a lot of ""Gazans brought all this on themselves, we're the innocent Jews"".


&gt; edit: reading your post history - I think you have something personal against Israel....http://www.reddit.com/user/Renner1/submitted/

An important point in this is that a shadkhan or parents setting up a match wasn't the end of the process. Marrying people sight-unseen, arranged by parents and matchmakers, wasn't terribly common. That was the start of the process. After arranging a match, the couple would meet to be sure they like each other, as would their families. Matches can ""fall through"" at this point in the process.

They couldn't even stop beating and shooting and abusing Palestinians after the big ol' Oslo thing that was to be the first step in the final process.

&gt; If Gazans don't want their leaders to be executed, then maybe they shouldn't elect a worldwide listed terrorist organization to lead them.

While dark shirt and jeans isn't necessarily a bad combo what's wrong here in this particular outfit is that the details just have terrible color coordination, and the hat isn't appropriate in formality.

Oh, so now you're going to try and claim that ""the Egyptians are worse"" because they shut Rafah and Gazans who want to leave because of how Israel makes Gaza can't get through?

The Egyptian issue is one of the main things where I take issue with Hamas. They ought to repudiate any connection with the MB in Egypt and make sure that none of the little Salafi Jihadi splinter groups are trying to aid the ""Sinai insurgency"".

This doesn't change the fact that it is Israel who is responsible for consistently deteriorating living standards in Gaza, amongst other things.

&gt; Why would I do that? You do have a hard on for anything anti-israel though

That's sort of the fall back MO for pro-Israeli people, isn't it?

And no- it's just something that should be focused on more often, considering how willing politicians and the like here are to pretend whatever Israel does is excusable or justifiable.

&gt; Is that why Gazans are trying to get out of Gaza in record numbers? You don't see that sort of migration in the west bank.

Saying ""Hamas was elected for specific reasons pertaining to social welfare and greater political accountability"" doesn't mean ""they magically fixed everything or are particularly adept politically"".

They're the faction I have the most issues with-- but the fact is they had their act together politically more then Fatah did at the time, and so they were elected. Israel still makes Gaza worse by the year, that's a big reason why people want to leave or are leaving.

&gt; Sure, but something tells me you don't want to hear it.

Do they or do they not kill many Gazans on a semi-regular basis and then try to justify all the collateral with bullshit?

&gt; I'm beginning to think you don't like jews.

I don't like Zionism considering the way it played out. I don't think Jews are special in any way (so that's as bad as hating them, to some Jewish people), but no, I wouldn't say ""I don't like Jews"".

Not based on their Jewishness, at any rate.

&gt; But ya, if I was posting to a sub called /r/gazasucks I don't think you'd be able to take me seriously either.

The two would be completely different. ""Gaza sucks because we make it suck and blame the people living there""."
Lluxx,changemyview,1389890652.0,"To check that I understand, is your argument that trans* people's transitioning is an unnecessary luxury, just as cosplaying is? 

To continue using this example, there is a vast difference between dressing up for a hobby and suffering from [Gender Identity Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity_disorder). Wikipedia (which I'm using for simplicity's sake, but I'm sure there are alternative sources if needed) says:

&gt; Symptoms of GID in children include disgust at their own genitalia, social isolation from their peers, anxiety, loneliness and depression... Adults with GID are at increased risk for stress, isolation, anxiety, depression, poor self-esteem and suicide.

Which I imagine are very different from the symptoms of your cosplaying not being quite as accurate as you'd prefer. 

So the free binders were - presumably - intended for poorer trans* individuals to be able to relieve some of the symptoms of their dysmorphia. If you had a condition which was causing you such deep distress and someone offered you a means of potentially helping to ease some of that distress, isn't it understandable that you would be upset at someone who is not suffering in any way taking that means so that they can do a hobby a little bit better? 

Perhaps it is a luxury for a trans* person to allievate their gender dysphoria. Poor trans* people may not be able to at all, depending on where they live, but they'll suffer for not having that 'luxury' whereas the cosplayers will not suffer. "

For example, some feminists believe in completely breaking down the concept of gender to achieve equality. I believe that we can still have multiple genders, but we need to focus on erasing the gender *hierarchy* and restrictive gender binary, not the entire concept of gender itself. 

I think a feminist should at the *very least* support equal rights for women, and prooobably agree with the concept of the patriarchy. But those two things tend to go hand in hand."

yoghurtpots,teenagers,1389890752.0,"The courting ritual of the British teenager is a rarely studied phenomena, seemingly bizarre and nonsensical to those unversed in its intricate ways. It can be broadly divided into three stages. The first of these is commonly referred to as ""flanter"" (from ""flirty"" and ""banter""), by those practiced in its subtle art. No true British teenager would engage in any activity as brash and reckless as admitting they fancy another teenager. 
No, they must instead deny all knowledge of feeling anything other than unadulterated hatred for their potential partner. This blatant arse-covering hypocrisy manifests itself in the form of merciless mutual teasing and physical abuse, obvious to all observers as a delicate and tentative form of flirtation. The British teenager is nothing if not cautious in expressing his/her affections. 

Eventually, once sufficient ironically (and occasionally unironically) awful ""your mum"" jokes have been exchanged, the couple will move into the ""seeing each other"" phase. This is characterised by ""meeting up"" without the presence of other friends. On no account is this to be referred to as ""dating"". To do so would shatter the facade of casual friendship, which must be maintained at all costs. Dating, to the British teen, is for people in films, people in their mid thirties, and Americans. 

After the ""seeing one another"" period, comes the final courtship stage, ""being together"". The two are now widely acknowledged by the wider social group as ""a couple"", although this can still be difficult for the uninformed outsider to detect. The couple may occasionally hold hands in public, but never outwardly admit to any affection. 

This is the British  way; built upon centuries of systemic awkwardness (and of course a healthy contempt for expressing all emotions), it is as strange as it is beautiful, and naturally very much superior to all that ""dating"" and ""feelings"" melarkey our American cousins are inclined to pursue. And hey, teen pregnancy figures are falling, so we're definitely doing something right. Possibly it's more what we're not doing. 

tl;dr : it's pretty incredible that anybody ever gets laid in Britain"

You're already pretty damn limited, there's 2 options: make a 2 point conversion, or score 3 times.  Scoring 3 times requires a markedly different strategy, namely trying the onside kick or trying to force a 3 and out.  Kicking makes you delay the decision until later when you might not have the time to adjust the strategy.  When you boil it down it only matters if you score 2 TDs(at any time) and miss the 2 pointer forcing you to onside kick.  Would you rather onside kick: down a field goal with minimal time, or down by 9 with 5 minutes to play?  Also you have to assume that in the 2nd scenario you're guaranteed to score a TD at some point, since if you don't score a 2nd TD you're comparing apples to oranges.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape

In it, there are several studies discussed. My take-away was that the police often just assume the victim is lying, especially if she ""didn't seem"" like she had been raped. The studies come to a different conclusion than the police based on the quality of the evidence (apparently, officers will just up and decide that an accusation was false, and choose not to examine the evidence as required by official standards).


Rumney, 2006: 

A 2006 paper by Philip N.S. Rumney in the Cambridge Law Journal offers a review of studies of false reporting in the USA, New Zealand and the UK.[9] Rumney draws two conclusions from his review of literature. First, the police continue to misapply the ""no-crime"" or ""unfounding"" criteria. Studies by Kelly et al. (2005), Lea et al. (2003), HMCPSI/HMIC (2002), Harris and Grace (1999), Smith (1989), and others found that police decisions to no-crime were frequently dubious and based entirely on the officer's personal judgement. Rumney notes that some officers seem to ""have fixed views and expectations about how genuine rape victims should react to their victimization."" He adds that ""qualitative research also suggests that some officers continue to exhibit an unjustified scepticism of rape complainants, while others interpret such things as lack of evidence or complaint withdrawal as 'proof' of a false allegation.""
Rumney's second conclusion is that it is impossible to ""discern with any degree of certainty the actual rate of false allegations"" due to the fact that many of the studies of false allegations have adopted unreliable or untested research methodologies. He argues, for instance, that in addition to their small sample size the studies by Maclean (1979) and Stewart (1981) used questionable criteria to judge an allegation to be false. MacLean deemed reports ""false"" if, for instance, the victim did not appear ""dishevelled"" and Stewart, in one instance, considered a case disproved, stating that ""it was totally impossible to have removed her extremely tight undergarments from her extremely large body against her will"".


British Home Office, 2005: 

A 2005 study, ""A gap or a chasm? Attrition in reported rape cases"" was the largest and most rigorous study to date commissioned by the British Home Office on UK rape crime, from the initial reporting of a rape through to legal prosecutions. The study was based on 2,643 sexual assault cases (Kelly, Lovett, and Regan, 2005). Of these, police departments classified 8% as false reports.[11]
The researchers noted that some of these classifications were based simply on the personal judgments of the police investigators and were made in violation of official criteria for establishing a false allegation. Closer analysis of this category applying the Home Office counting rules for establishing a false allegation and excluding cases where the application of the cases where confirmation of the designation was uncertain reduced the percentage of false reports to 3%. The researchers concluded that ""one cannot take all police designations at face value"" and that ""[t]here is an over-estimation of the scale of false allegations by both police officers and prosecutors."" Moreover, they added:
The interviews with police officers and complainants’ responses show that despite the focus on victim care, a culture of suspicion remains within the police, even amongst some of those who are specialists in rape investigations. There is also a tendency to conflate false allegations with retractions and withdrawals, as if in all such cases no sexual assault occurred. This reproduces an investigative culture in which elements that might permit a designation of a false complaint are emphasised (later sections reveal how this also feeds into withdrawals and designation of ‘insufficient evidence’), at the expense of a careful investigation, in which the evidence collected is evaluated"

Renner1,canada,1389891235.0,"In comparison to what Israel does, and considering that the actions of all the Palestinian groups are in retaliation to Israeli actions?

Not really. I don't like conservative/ultra-conservative Islamism, but I take into account that Hamas doesn't apply the worst practises of the conservative Islamist group, and I think that any use of suicide bombs as a tactical weapon should've been directed solely at IDF,  border police, shabak, shin bet, or armed ""settlers"".

I understand the desire to make the indifferent Israeli majority feel the sort of thing that the Palestinians had been experiencing, but all in all I think the suicide bombs as a tactic wasn't properly thought out.

I obviously realize that they were in response to actions by Israelis that resulted in many Palestinians dead or maimed, and the underlying factors behind any sort of Palestinian armed action."

benk4,nfl,1389891250.0,"It depends on the situation.  At some point you have to get a TD as well.  You should weigh how likely you are to get a TD now vs how likely you are to get a TD later.  

If I'm in that situation with a 4th and inches from the 5 yard line I'm going for it.   My probablity of scoring a TD this drive is probably better than my chance of getting it later.  But if I have a 4th and 12 from the 20 yard line I'd probably kick.  

Oftentimes teams kick early on manageable 4th downs but end up later trying a play to the endzone from the 30 yard line with 2 seconds left.  Wouldn't you much rather have been trying a FG there?"

bananaruth,todayilearned,1389891449.0,"It's NISVS. And I'm not really certain that a woman can *rape* a man with her vagina. I certainly think it is an abuse, a crime, and totally possible to happen, but it isn't really rape. Now, if she stuck something up his ass, that would be rape. I guess I'm of the mindset that penetration is the defining factor. Even the NISVS stats don't list it as rape. If you want to discuss sexual violence, then yes, men certainly have a problem with it (although still only around 1/3 the number of male victims as female).

&gt; I think you are confusing being republican with being free from empathy.

Not at all, much of my family is Republican and they do a lot of good for the community. They give a lot more to charity than many liberal folks I know. I personally don't care for any of the political parties, though libertarian is slightly appealing if I had to choose. 

Back to the homeless people example: If you don't think they deserve to be homeless, you are empathizing a bit, whether you realize it or not. Why do you think that they don't deserve to be homeless then? Because no one should be without a house (like the nice one you have) - empathy. Because they're down on their luck (which could happen to anyone, even you) - empathy. 

What you don't seem to understand is that, historically speaking, peoples interests = men's interests. What's the reason for not having men's interests? It's the same reason there isn't a 'white history month'. It would be ridiculously redundant. As for the issues that you raised, few intelligent people are laughing at these issues or not taking them seriously. I'd like to see anywhere where, for example, suicide is laughed at or not considered seriously. In fact, we've made great strides in the past few years at getting rid of the stigma surrounding mental illness. This similarly effects a large portion of the homeless population who suffer from mental illness - especially PTSD.  

I never said we should segregate the problem of uninformed woman voters from uninformed voters in general. I merely brought it up to explain the dearth of female elected officials. (Or simply how awful most elected officials are). I don't see though how it would hurt to have woman's organizations working to correct misinformation or get information to the public anymore than any organization doing it would. Also, feminism does solve men's problems since feminism is fundamentally about equality. For instance you mentioned SSS, well these days there are many women in the US armed forces. Does that mean women should be required to register? Israel, for instance, requires both men and women to serve. If women and men are equal, then it should be all or none. Personally, the SSS seems antiquated and I feel it should be completely removed. "
aDDnTN,motorcycles,1389891453.0,"fyi, they are bulky too and you need a good air compressor to lift them, unless you get one of the electric worm-drive units.

also, if you are need the front wheel up, you can get a triple tree stand and then do the same thing as i said before about clamping and strapping the rear wheel down, but then lift it with the triple tree stand instead of jacking it under the motor.

imo, front stands are dangerous, but triple tree stands are rock steady. just make sure the rear is lifted on a stable stand or the rear is locked in place, but free to rotate. awful thing to have a bike fall off a stand, lift, or table lift. 

Always use the straps, work with a helper/spotter, lift slowly, don't rush, and always check everything twice and then continuously as you work.

CadHuevFacial,gis,1389891455.0,"If you haven't heard of it, I'd suggest signing up with [SNL](http://www.snl.com/) and read up on major refineries, transmission lines and projects, production and storage facilities, and plants in your region to learn more about the breadth of influence different utilities have. I can't recall unfortunately whether or not a professional subscription is required to access this data (sorry in advance if it is!), but if it's an option, it is an incredible resource. 

SNL offers an adequate mapping platform and an extensive database of geographic data regarding the majority of utilities and their projects in the U.S. The mapping service itself takes some time to get used to as it differs greatly from the ArcGIS interface, but it's simple enough. Ventyx is another software geared towards energy and mining enterprises, but it's not as inclusive and I think far more frustrating (and expensive) than SNL is.

Anyway, I suppose my main point is to learn about the actual utilities you'll be working with. I think learning about the energy market and industry even on a basic level will help foster a more solid regional and geographic understanding of project placement and location planning. Good luck!"

JasonWaterfall,AskWomen,1389891465.0,"Experiments have shown that most women exhibit genital arousal when seeing all kinds of sexual things, even baboons having sex etc., while hardly any are actually turned on by that kind of stuff.

Go for 2 and make it.  2nd TD wins the game:  40% chance.  
Go for 2 and miss, Score again and miss again losing: 36% chance.

Weeeeeelll.... forgive me, but I wince a little every time someone says ""gender doesn't matter."" I mean, it *shouldn't* in certain cases, but ultimately it does. It matters a great deal. It's a huge part of our identities, how the world views us, and in turn, how we view the world. 

It's pretty shitty, for instance, to tell a transgendered person that gender doesn't matter. It *does* matter, but what shouldn't be brought into the equation is that one gender is better than the other. 

There's plenty of games (and books and movies) out there that tell a man's story about a man's experiences and about masculinity in general. And that's totally cool.

It would also be cool to see *just as many* games and movies about a woman's experiences, about femininity, motherhood, etc. There is room for all types of perspectives.

Gender doesn't play a huge role in our *characteristics*, true, but it's still an enormous part of our identities and how society views and treats us.

It also should be noted that those Palestinians in Knesset are treated with hostility by all except the left or far left, and lack the ability to seriously change Israeli policy in regards to the Palestinian people as a whole.

Israel in the Palestinian West Bank operates in a way that is worse then South Africa Apartheid, and the Gaza Strip is of course Israel's very own weapons testing sector, with live subjects to declare as enemies."

Mr_Diggums,StLouis,1389892935.0,"Part of that stems (no pun intended) probably from the view that legalizing, taxing, and selling it via retail is a way to curb the power of gangs/drug violence. 

While legalization should include the ability to grow one's own weed, the legal sale of it from stores will cater to the masses who want a quality product they can trust, or do not want to grow their own. If you only legalize personal grows, without offering a retail option, you still give drug gangs the incentive (if not more) to grow their own, sell it as they have, and battle for territory. Sure, you can buy from a friend (and many would), but the gangs still want the money and power, and now they can grow their own weed without trouble! Similarly, Capone and Co. would likely done the exact same thing during prohibition even if people could make their own. 

The price is also relative. Weed is typically cheap as hell in CA and CO when compared to MO, where an 8th will run you $60. Even if you pay high taxes, I doubt that legal prices would exceed the current black market price. There is a whole economic analysis therein, but there is a reason weed is (and has been) so cheap in those other states, compared to here."

If you're interested in the difference between gender identity disorder and other dysphorias where people are deeply unhappy due to their appearance, there was an excellent post on a thread in this subreddit the other day about what makes GID different to the other disorder (I'm not a professional so I can't recall the name, sorry). In that post, it's shown that it's not so much that transgender people deserve more sympathy than people with other dysphorias, but that the way to help GID is very different than the way to help the others. As in, GID's dysphoria can be cured by transitioning, whereas for others if they alter whatever they are fixating on, they will not be happy and will just find something else to despise. 

Edit: [Here](http://en.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1uy91r/i_do_not_think_transsexuality_should_be_part_of/cemz4ab) is that comment about the difference between GID and Body Dysmorphic Disorder and why they are treated differently, though both deserve sympathy. "

&gt;**Possible causes**
&gt;- Faulty Evaporative Emission System (EVAP) Pressure sensor
&gt;- Evaporative Emission System (EVAP) Pressure sensor harness is open or shorted
&gt;- Evaporative Emission System (EVAP) Pressure sensor circuit poor electrical connection	


&gt;**Possible causes**
&gt;An excessively low voltage from the sensor is sent to Engine Control Module (ECM).


&gt;**Possible symptoms**
- Engine Light ON (or Service Engine Soon Warning Light)


&gt;**P0452 Description**


&gt;The Evaporative Emission System (EVAP) control system pressure sensor detects pressure in the purge line. The sensor output voltage to the Engine Control Module (ECM) increases as pressure increases. The EVAP control system pressure sensor is not used to control the engine system. It is used only for on board diagnosis.

StuHardy,WritingPrompts,1389894045.0,"""Is it in yet?""

""Ummm...yes.""

There was a very uncomfortable silence in the theatre. No-one was sure what to do.

""So...am I dead?""

The executioner pinched him. The criminal flinched.

""No, you're still feeling pain. Very much alive.""

""Well...this is awkward.""

""SHOOT HIM!""

The scream came from behind the glass. A family member of the victim slammed her hands against the glass. Soundproof, my foot.

""KILL THE BASTARD! SHOOT HIM BETWEEN THE EYES!""

""Ma'am, we have a strict procedure to follow. Don't worry, we'll make sure he gets his due.""


------------------------------------------------------

""Wow, I guess you really won't get your due.""

The court case following the failed execution ruled in favour of the criminal; the state had attempted to kill him through legal means and failed. Repeated attempts found that the only way to kill him would either be through force or a more toxic chemical, both illegal under US law. Besides, the case had reached the news networks and papers. It was too big a story to sweep under the rug.

Under the Double Jeopardy law, the criminal could not be re-tried. In order for him to not be hounded by the press (or killed by the public), a dummy would go through the standard entrance, while the criminal would be escorted out of a side entrance, anonymously. While the crowds were distracted, the criminal reached the side gate, escorted by the guard who was his executioner. As he was about to leave, he heard a rustling through the trees. There was the family member, brandishing a gun, adamant on completing the job the executioner could not. As the executioner reached for his weapon, the criminal spoke:

""Why are you doing this?""

""You have to pay for what you did.""

""I already have - 20 years, within the walls behind me. No care, no love. No soul could care for a man like me. Yes, there are those sick enough to support me - racists, Anti-Semites, homophobes - people who believe I had a sentiment to my actions. That they can be justified. But they cannot. Nothing can. There was no pattern - it was just a crime that went tragically wrong.""

""You took my father's life.""

""I know. And I meant it at the trial when I said that not a day goes by where I don't regret it. But you need to ask yourself - is what you're doing right? Even after I die - and believe me, if not here, then it will still be soon - would you find peace?""

The family member paused.

""Stop trying to change me! I know what I have to do.""

""Your father was a good man, who just found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the time has changed to now and the place has changed to here. What will you choose to be - like your father, or like his killer?""

The family member paused again. Then, broke down in tears and dropped the gun. As they lay there sobbing, the criminal picked up his things and walked down the road. He had been lucky again, but he knew all too well that a man's luck will eventually run out."

To ignore that and claim ""age is just a number"" is ridiculous.  Age isn't just a number.  Healthy well adjusted men are attracted to women their own age and do not pursue people who are at such a period of growth and change in their life.  On the whole.

Judging from your original post, you sound beta as fuck. You panicked like a little girl when you couldn't find her and kept begging your girlfriend to not see anyone. Beg? Really?

Break up with this girl. She's just comfortable with you. She doesn't find you sexually appealing.

She already cheated anyway. And if you're going to be alpha, you shouldn't hang around her kind. 

Just look at how your posted your cries for help. Just read it over and over. Look at how it makes you look. I get that you need help. I understand that. But don't sound like a panicky little girl writing in her blog. That type of personality pushes girls away.

Go to r/seduction or r/relationships for help. But don't sound like a baby about it. 

If you want a woman to like you for real, just ask yourself: what would James Bond do?

If he wouldn't do it, then it's probably beta.

benk4,nfl,1389894285.0,"&gt; As others have said, you have no idea what can happen in the final minutes. 

That's true, but the odds of them snapping the ball into the endzone or something really dumb like that are pretty much negligible.  

&gt; If you take yourself out of it early, then those last 5 minutes are meaningless.

I don't care about the last 5 minutes, I care about what increases my overall chance of winning.  When the result is decided is pretty irrelevant.  

&gt; The opposing offense can't go into victory formation.

That's not true.  Offenses only go into victory formation when they're leading and can run out the clock.  Whether they're leading by 1 or 100 is irrelevant.  

&gt; You are forcing them to continue playing aggressively because they know you are only 2 plays away from tieing. And that means mistakes happen.

That's the core of your argument, but I don't think it really adds up.  Do you really think the offense is that much more likely to fuck up and turn the ball over with a 7 point lead and short time than with a 9 point lead?  Either way they're playing keep away.  They're running the ball and playing high percentage passes to try to get first downs.  Not many teams are aggressively trying to score with short time and a 7 point lead.  In fact, I'd say the odds of them turning it over are higher with a 9 point lead, since now you instruct your defense to play for a turnover rather than a 3 and out.  

However going for 2 early gives you the knowledge of what you need to do.  If you don't make it, you're in rough shape but you can still recover.  If you go for 2 really late and miss, it's game over.  "

The gunships are powered by arcane power, and are operated and maintained by wizard pilots. Paladins use some tinkered/arcane tech to fine tune their Detect Evil as radar. The weapons are a combination of arcane and conventional projectile artillery for ground supression, and air elemental projectiles for ship-to-ship combat and boarding. The ships are valuable and difficult to construct, so the preferred method of boarding a ship is to rid of its defenders using elementals, spare the pilot, and send a boarding party.

SouthernNewEnglander,Alabama,1389894725.0,"This is nothing short of economic treason to South Alabama. Some points:

* As to the comments regarding the Everglades, the reason why there was a hue and cry during the 2013 Shutdown there was because the local NPS units are economic powerhouses. The influx of visitors creates vast *private-sector job* opportunities for as long as the protected resources exist.
* The NPS has little trouble managing its holdings as it can outsource most of the management to God/Nature/Flying Spaghetti Monster. Concessions (food/lodging/activities) on federal lands create more *private-sector jobs*.
* Private inholdings are common in NPS units, so river houses could be kept by their owners forever. Typically adjacency to a NPS unit increases property values. An increase in the Delta's profile would also improve the vacation rental market, creating new revenue streams for South Alabamians and small-business opportunities in surrounding towns.
* The proximity of a National Park to Mobile could add new energy (*private-sector jobs*) to my favorite city in the country and cement the metropolitan area as the definitive location for experiencing Deep Southern culture and environments.
* Fishing is permitted in virtually all National Parks and hunting/ATV use is permitted in many National Preserves. Some combo of Park and Preserve status would maintain traditional access for South Alabamians. Writing as a sportsman with family ties to South Alabama, I'd feel great having guaranteed lifetime fishing access in the Delta.
* The California redwoods were protected through a combination of National and State Parks. We could embed a State Park in the National Park and Preserve (maybe with an emphasis on recreation) to ensure a reliable revenue cut for Alabama.

The economically-hawkish thing to do for South Alabama is to support the creation of a National Park in the Delta. Why is Rep. Byrne afraid of a prosperous South Alabama?"

sexandliquor,houston,1389894989.0,"There was just a thread about this on the front page today, had some good advice about finding a good mechanic. Finding a good mechanic is like finding a good doctor or dentist. It might take you a few times to find the right one for you.

Independents who rely on word of mouth and not foot traffic are the best shops to look at. Just because a shop won't take your parts doesn't necessarily mean they're not a good shop either. A lot of shops don't like it when you bring in your own parts because usually the customer brings in the wrong parts or cheap inferior quality parts.

Dealerships and chain franchises are always going to be a little bit higher on parts and labor as they have more overhead.

A good shop with mechanics worth their weight aren't going to solve problems by throwing parts at it, but sometimes problems are going to get misdiagnosed. Cars are complicated and not an exact science.

If a mechanic recommends having some stuff replaced, it doesn't always necessarily mean you are getting upsold either. Cars have lots of wearable parts that go bad after age and use gets ahold of them. Sometimes we recommend things be replaced to keep the car running in tip-top shape and keep it road worthy. A bad tie road end that fails catastrophically on the highway will fuck up your day real fast. So will an old tire that is so worn down it's showing cords.

You can always say no to a mechanic. This seems to be what most people get hung up on. A lot of shops, if they think they can run all over you, they will. You need to be firm about what you want done, and be informed. If you're not informed about your car and agree to whatever, you can't run around saying you got screwed by the mechanic. We can't do anything without you authorizing repairs first. Once you authorize repairs, that's on you.

Just some FYI."

dreamingofjellyfish,AskWomen,1389895139.0,"I think you've confused an entitlement vs a legal right. An entitlement means someone is owed that thing. Entitlement requires that another party has an obligation. Example: Person A is entitled to life and liberty, therefore person B is obligated not to kill person A or lock them up.

Sex is never an entitlement, because no one is obligated to provide sex. 

However that's separate from what's allowed, or a conditional legal right. Example: I have a right to eat sushi, meaning this is legally allowed &amp; I can't be put in jail for eating sushi. I am not entitled to sushi - no one is obligated to provide me with sushi, and if I want sushi I am responsible for finding a sushi restaurant and paying for the sushi.

In the second example sushi is analogous to sex. Consenting adults have a right to have sex in the sense that they cannot be jailed for having sex. This is in contrast to some countries where pre-marital sex or homosexual sex is illegal. However, no one is entitled to sex, so if a person wants sex they have to go find a consenting adult partner.

As I said no one is entitled to sex. But entitlement gets discussed a lot because sometimes people act entitled to sex. This is a problem because it generally means the person who is acting entitled is being coercive, or disrespectful, or otherwise a shitty person.

That's who the big bad in this season of A.o.S will turn out to be; S.H.I.E.L.D. is being taken over by the skrulls and it's up to Team Coulson to clean house.

edit: Also, Coulson is a skrull that Fury reprogrammed. Fury was starting to suspect something wasn't quite right with certain high ranking members of S.H.I.E.L.D., so he kidnapped one and started ""interrogating"" them. He was shocked to discover they were actually a shapeshifting alien. He knew he couldn't trust anyone, so he decided to make someone he could trust. He took the skrull, rewrote it's brain so it thought it was Coulson, and then let Psuedo-Coulson have his own team, and near-total autonomy, with the intention of calling on them when it was time to purge S.H.I.E.L.D. (and any other place the skrull had infiltrated). But then the skrull commander, code name: the clairvoyant, caught wind of Fury's plan. Pseudo-Coulson was captured so he could be deprogrammed (the whole ""why are you alive?"" line of questioning was a way of getting him to remember he wasn't human), but the team ""rescued"" him before they could finish. Now Pseudo-Coulson is starting to remember, and soon he'll have to decide if he is a skrull, or human!

Listen to what the anesthesiologists tell you.  We do this *every single day*.  If you can get to do a case under mask anesthesia, you can learn a lot and start to train your hand and arm muscles to hold a mask on a face properly.  I used to make residents do that.   It's really good training.

i am a bit of greenthumb, so i'm gonna say that it's really not THAT hard, and if you use good materials, you will get good results. There really isn't that much more complication. You don't do anything knowledge intensive, but if you want better yield/potency, you have to DO MORE WORK.

if you plant a seed then ignore it, yes it won't be great when you get around to harvesting it. 

But if you spend the time to cultivate it and take measures to maximize yield, then it will be better quality. This extra effort pays out, but it's extremely involved and time intensive.

honestly, i don't see big time farms with 10 people for 1000 plants (1:100) will care to spend all that extra time that joe wrenchturner will spend with his 10 plants (1:10).

Some people notice these things, but most people don't.  I have been obviously pregnant since November, there is seriously no way it should have gone unnoticed, but it did.  Even as late as mid december people were surprised when I mentioned it, and this is my second baby, it's really really obvious.  My first pregnancy I was 7/8 months pregnant and no one would have guessed.  People are that oblivious.

The one thing I can tell you will 100% give it away is maternity pants.  The belly panel leaves a seam across your tummy and anyone who has had a baby knows EXACTLY what that seam is.  It sticks out more than bad panty lines.  

Stick with the loose, flowy tops that are in style right now, loose tunics or dresses work well too, and either buy under-belly maternity pants or wear super low rise pants if you can comfortably.  The giveaway between a fat belly and a pregnant belly is the underside of the bump.  So avoid anything that is fitted to the underside of your belly and your hips.

benk4,nfl,1389895787.0,"&gt; There is a reason why every team does it this way.

I'll start with the fact that this means nothing.  Until this year every team was kicking on 4th and inches.  Coaches fuck up odds on a regular basis.  

&gt; that doesn't make sense. If you go for two and miss, you are pretty much eliminated at that point in the game. 

Yeah you're in rough shape.  But what if you go for 2 and miss after the 2nd TD?  Now you're officially eliminated from the game.  Either way if you don't get the 2 pointer you're probably going to lose, but I'll take almost dead as compared to actually dead.

&gt; if the opposing team fumbles the next kickoff, or the opposing running back fumbles trying to run out the clock, it does you no good.

Sure it does!  If you get the ball back you have a chance to score and try an onside kick!  It's better than missing on the 2nd TD and packing it up and going to the locker room.  

&gt; I also don't think going for two and converting it first gives you that much of an edge. You still have to make a stop and get a td. The reward does not out way the risk.

If you make the 2 pointer (whether on the first or the second TD) there isn't a difference.  If you miss the 2 pointer there is a difference though, the knowledge of how many points you need and how to adjust your strategy.  If you kick first you aren't completely sure of how many scores you need.  You're not sure if you need to play hyper aggressive or play for the stop.  Going for it first settles this.

The supposed advantage of kicking first is that the offense is now somehow more likely to create a turnover.  I think they're probably just as likely to run the ball and try to get a first as they are if you were down 9.   So a turnover is equally likely."

girlaboutoaktown,AskReddit,1389895891.0,"Former executive recruiter here.  Phone interviewing was like, 50% of my job.

The best advice I can give - and this applies to ALL interviews - is to not be vague.  When asked a specific question, answer it specifically.  Don't just say ""I was good at my job.""  Say, during my time at x company, a project I was in charge of generated 33% more revenue for the company the next year"".  Even if you've only worked non-white-collar jobs, tell me about the time you defused a really angry customer, or got a special commendation.  Specifics.

Don't interrupt the interviewer.  Treat them with friendly politeness, don't act terrified of them, either.  We're normal people, we might be working with you in the future.  Try to sound confident and relaxed.  Interviewers are generally aware that you're nervous, and that's OK, but try to fake a relaxed, attentive attitude.

And it's OK to fuck up a question if you're honest about it.  When asking a very specific question, he said, ""I'm really sorry, I remember the project you're talking about, but I am having trouble with the specifics at the moment.  Would you mind if I sent you the answer via email after the interview?""  I appreciated that he was candid instead of bullshitting me with generic vague statements like most candidates would.

Read over your resume before the interview, and have it in front of you during the interview.

Think up answers to questions about your ""best qualities"" and ""worst qualities"" before you get on the phone.  And don't give obvious bullshit answers like ""My worst quality is I'm a workaholic!""  Give actual traits that are weaknesses, but address how you're actively working to improve them.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389895978.0,"Partly because in the real world you don't always get to set your own hours either.  It's up to you to learn to function a certain way.

Different parts of the world are different of course, but for little kids you don't want them walking home in the dark, you don't want school buses clogging up traffic at rush hour, parents need to get kids to school and then get off to work themselves etc.  

Some schools need to run multiple shifts, so the school itself runs 8-5 even if a given set of students are not there the whole time.

Particularly teenagers, if you want them to have jobs after school you need to give them time to get from school to their job and then do something  at the job.  Say waiting tables at a restaurant (which was  common gig for highschoolers when I went to school, though times have changed on that) you want  them there *before* the dinner rush, not during it.  

A large part of it is also that just because the world changes around it doesn't mean that an institution  as big and connected and complex as schools can turn on a dime.  50 or 60 years ago when a much larger percentage of the population worked on farms and people weren't up all  hours of the night watching TV  or playing video games teenager may well have performed  better at 8am versus 9am.  

What people are observing, and that you are talking about may be an effect rather than a cause  - if you could just get kids to go to bed a couple of hours earlier and actually sleep would it fix things?  Easier said than done  to test, as kids are  somewhat wired by their friends, TV, the internet and multiple years of bad habits built up.  That's not just kids, it's parents, it's societal etc.  Changing school start times might simply be shifting thing to cope with some underlying other 'problem' (that great shows kids watch start too late maybe).  Sometimes you should change - to cope with the world that exists and not wait hoping the one you want materializes, but lots of people aren't in favour of that  sort of thing.  "

In this instance, the opposing team still needs to get first downs. So it puts them in a bind. They want to run the clock out with run plays, but they also need 1-2 first downs. There's still options. Those last 5 minutes matter and virtually every expert/coach seems to agree on that. I don't understand why so many redditors think they know better on this one.

They're going to be playing keep away either way!  What makes them more likely to turn over the ball playing keep away with a 9 point lead than with a 7 point lead?  I'd say it's more likely with a 9 point lead as you can tell your defense to go all out for the turnover at all costs.  

What it boils down to is this, do you think the supposed increased chance of a turnover or freak play has a bigger effect than knowing whether you need to onside kick/play desperation football.  I say knowing the strategy is more important.  

&gt; Those last 5 minutes matter and virtually every expert/coach seems to agree on that. I don't understand why so many redditors think they know better on this one.

Coaches and their tendencies have been repeatedly shown to play way too conservatively in the past and be wrong about a lot of strategies.  They're good at playing football, not doing the math. 

Also hardly every expert agrees.  Bill Barnwell is a high profile analyst who has advocated going for 2 in this situation.  "

If I had been predisposed to react abruptly/dismissively to random chats then I might be a very different person today! 

I do agree that tall girls can get the worst of it, but my 6 foot sister is a prime example of how reacting positively to attention and unsolicited conversation can help create an adult with no body image issues at all. My family always told us that being tall was a great thing and people were simply curious. Once again, everyone 's different, but she's a natural extrovert and I was painfully awkward. Nowadays we're on a level, I think because of how we both react to the constant height chat.

johnavel,todayilearned,1389896372.0,"Instead of finding a legitimate source, I veered pretty hard the other direction, so here's a pretty hard-hitting article about the event titled [""Space Angels: Aliens or Signs of the Apocalypse?""](http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2012/04/space-angels-aliens-or-sign-of-the-apocalypse/).

Here's a snippet of the research:

&gt;I know that for some it might seem like a stretch jumping from what most people would consider to be a benignly heartwarming encounter with celestial beings to the end of the world as we know it, but as a former altar boy and parochial school student there is one thing I know all too well; and that is that when seven angels show up trouble is not far behind.

&gt;And for those who might suggest that these peacefully smiling angels could not possibly have nefarious intentions I would only state that, according to scripture, the purpose of the Apocalypse is not to cause evil, but to eliminate it from the Earth… and what angel would not be happy about that?

And some side research from the History Channel, which is certainly a reliable source:

&gt;Thanks to the History Channel’s hit series “Ancient Aliens,” there’s been a worldwide revival of Zecharia Sitchin and, famed author of “Chariots of the Gods,” Erich Von Dänike’s theories regarding extraterrestrial ambassadors who supposedly visited Earth thousands of years ago and profoundly affected the evolution of the human race and civilization itself.

&gt;We must consider the prospect that the six cosmonauts aboard the Salyut 7 might have seen not God’s messengers, but corporeal manifestations of these unique alien creatures, which have communicated with mankind since the dawn of history.

So to sum up: there's tons of evidence that they're either aliens or angels, doesn't really matter which, but definitely not a hallucination because that's crazy talk."

thesilvertongue,Parenting,1389896454.0,"If you had told everyone originally that you felt guilty, remorseful, and ashamed that children were hurt under your care, no one would have made any further attacks on your character. If you had shown even the tiniest bit of humility I would have been on your side. 

But you didn't do that at all up until right now. You just made excuses and flat out said it wasn't your ""responsibility"" and made a ton of unfounded personal attacks on me being the NSA or something. If I were a parent and you adopted that super defensive ""not my fault"", insult slinging attitude, you'd have been fired. Now, as you admit, that's not what you said the parents. But that is what you said to me so I was justified in thinking you have no sense of remorse or personal responsibility. That is a terrible attitude to have when something awful happens to your children. 

Can't you see why I would have had a problem with that? Normal people would have felt bad about what happened and wished they did something differently (even if they couldn't realistically have done anything). They would think of their child being in danger as a failure on their part. I'm glad you understand this now and admit to being remorseful, apologetic, and humble instead in your heart and with the parents. I still don't understand why you needed to be dismissive of their behavior, defensive, and so full of hate in every comment you addressed to me. 

Just so you know, several people (not you) did try to dismiss the behavior as not real sex, not real rape, and not really harmful activity. That's in writing in the comments, not something I made up.  These comments really pushed me over the edge.

Also, no where did I or anyone else say you were a child rapist or that you should have handled the situation differently after the fact.  

I'm sorry I upset you. Again, if you had shown any signs of the humility or remorse you felt about your children being hurt I'd have let you be. I'm sure you and the other nannies in your community agree that making excuses and insults is not the proper thing to do when a kid is hurt (or ever actually). I still maintain that your behavior in earlier comments was inexcusable and my calling you out on it was justified. 

In the future, if you get that upset, it's best to block/hide the comments and move on. Insult slinging and accusations won't make you less upset or likely turn the discussion in your favor.   

Anyway, this discussion has become utterly pointless now. Clearly you feel very bad about about the harm that occurred the children under your care so I won't press the matter any further. 

Even though you're cruel and unremorseful on the internet, you're probably a decent nanny in real life. No nanny or parent has prevented every dangerous episode so you shouldn't let remorse upset you too much. These things happen. I'm going to guess that your nicer and more polite in real life than you are in this forum. 

More importantly, I'm glad the children you cared for are happy, healthy, and successful despite everything that has happened to them. I hope these events won't trouble them unduly in the future. 

BTW, retiquette dictates downvotes are for comments that don't contribute to the discussion. Not for opinions or ideas that you don't like.

I am simply making the case that right now, the only way to possibly profit in the short term is to a) be a DEA agent and get OT for all the casework they are doing to bring it down, b) move to CO and start growing, c) move to colorado and open a shop, d) move to colorado, start growing and sell on the black market. 

And that, imo, the best long term play would be to invest in the already entrenched ""vice"" equities, in this case the ones that deal with the current most popular legal method to smoke something. This would be the case that CO leads the way and the whole thing blows up and pot becomes as legal as beer/cigs over the long term.

Of course, you can ALWAYS make money supplying product, regardless of the legality.

TheBishop7,MLS,1389897225.0,"I've always thought MacMath was one of the worst starters in the league. He's been an ""up-and-coming"" goalkeeper for 3 years now. He's still very young (22) and I think he got the starting spot before he was ready. He doesn't seem to be growing very much either. In my opinion, Philly should be looking to trade MacMath to another team who could use a very solid backup GK. Perhaps a team whose starter gets called up for international duty a lot, like RSL or Portland, would be a good fit.

I definitely don't see the MacMath/Blake situation very similar to the Manning/Luck scenario. Manning was arguably the best quarterback in the league and Luck was far and away the top draft prospect that year. MacMath is mediocre at best and Philly needed a keeper. Vancouver also needed a keeper so Philly had to trade up so Vancouver couldn't. Blake is a fine prospect, but there's no reason to assume he has the same ""guaranteed"" success that Luck has had in the NFL."

Also, this depends entirely on what you mean by 'benefits'. What benefits are trans people enjoying, exactly? Getting free things that will help their dysphoria? Well, if somebody wanted to offer otherkin free cat ears, as an example, then they have a perfect right to and if in this competition aimed at helping otherkin, cosplayers came in and took the cat ears for themselves then I believe the otherkin have the same right to be upset.

I would start making inquiries now so that it can hopefully be dealt with before your little one arrives.  Basically, no.  It's unacceptable.  This is a healthcare facility and refusing legitimate access on the basis of age alone is not permissible.  It could even be illegal depending on the location and the discrimination laws in the area.  Go through official channels, start by asking why they've made that particular decision, then ask if they are refusing patients under 18, if there are alternate precautions that might be taken like wearing masks.  There is no logical distinction between a 17 yo and an 18yo in terms of physical health that I'm aware of, so I would push a long way on this one.  Furthermore, if your 2 yo has been vaccinated he is no more of a threat than you are.  Pass it on to local media too if you can.  Whenever I see something silly like this under discussion it inevitably turns out to be a well meaning but poorly thought out and prematurely implemented policy which is easily overturned with the littlest bit of scrutiny.

Honestly I would change hospitals over this.  My eldest was in the delivery room within 30 minutes before and after his brother was born.  I fully intend to do the same with my boys this time.  No way would I accept a ridiculous blanket ban on children in the hospital preventing my family from being present.  Especially not because of a flu they've been vaccinated against!  Hell, I'd get the rest of my family scheming together and sneak them in!  My older boy could just lie and say he's 18, it's obviously not true but who's going to make him show ID?

benk4,nfl,1389897673.0,"&gt; A team with a 7 point lead plays drastically different than a 9 point lead. They aren't even in the same ball-park.

Not with short time it isn't.  The number 1 goal is not to turn over the ball.  The number 2 goal is to get a first down.  They're both going to run the ball twice, with maybe a pass attempt on 3rd down.  Then punt the ball if they don't get it.  There isn't a huge difference.  The difference in the defensive play can be huge though.  Having all your guys trying to rip the ball out as compared to just making a tackle.

&gt; If you know you strategy because you don't have options then the opposing team also knows your strategy because you don't have options. The on-side kick is not a high percentage play when opposing teams know it's going to happen.

Sure, but adjusting the strategy is very important.  If you know you need 2 possessions you know to play for 2 possessions.  If you don't know how many you need, you have to guess.  The advantage goes to the underdog here because they can swing a massive and necessary change in strategy as compared to a relatively minor one.

&gt; Simply incorrect. They know the math. Coaches don't typically go for it on 4th down because when they don't get it fans/media (people who don't understand the stats) destroy them. This leads to getting fired. What we are talking about here has nothing to do with playing conservative and everything to do with playing the numbers. You just don't see the numbers like 99% of coaches and experts.

It has everything to do with playing conservatively!  Losing by 1 score looks much better than losing by 2 scores.  Also if they lose after the failed 2 pointer everyone will jump down their throats.  It's literally the exact same reason.

&gt; That is the ONLY person I've ever heard advocate this. Find me someone else. Other wise I'm sticking with hardly any expert thinks this.

This enough for you?

[Football perspective](http://www.footballperspective.com/trailing-by-15-in-the-middle-of-the-4th-quarter-teams-are-foolish-to-not-go-for-2-after-touchdowns/)  Apparently several other coaches agree too!

This is besides the point though.  Just because there's a bandwagon doesn't mean it's right.

Not_Han_Solo,Netrunner,1389897702.0,"I'm pretty bullish about Keyhole, but I also see a definite problem with it: its memory cost.

Anarchs run a *lot* of programs, typically; either we're talking a Caissa spread or a Virus deck, generally speaking, and either way you're looking at something like 6 MU for a full rig, between three breakers, Datasucker, Imp, and something else which depends on the deck.  Grimiore helps, as does Djinn, but I can't think of an Anarch deck at the moment which has 2 MU to spare in their full rig.  That's a serious problem which Keyhole users are going to have to overcome.

~~The solution that I suspect is coming is a move from Djinn, which is a great program, but seriously limited in a deck which plans on using Keyhole as its core agenda-scoring method (and it fits in beautifully into a Noise virus mill deck too), to Shaharazad with Clone Chip backup in order to solve MU issues.  The tradeoff sacrifices Djinn's tutoring effect and leaves the runner more vulnerable to program trashing, but that deck would be running out a *lot* of programs over the course of a game, and the economy boost that Shaharazad gives when you've hosted a half-dozen useful but non-essential programs on it (basically, everything but your core breakers plus Keyhole)~~.  Edit: Re-reading the card when you're not a total noob anymore is pro.  That being said, I think that the MU issue is a standing issue that Anarch runners are going to have to solve in order to make use of Keyhole.  Edit Edit: Clearly, I'm an Anarch noob.  Ignore me.

I don't see Keyhole getting splashed very often.  Criminals don't have the MU to host it and don't have many good options to get more MU to do so; look at the hand-wringing over Garrote, an objectively excellent icebreaker which doesn't seem to have a home right now.  Shapers *might* go for it, but I don't really see them as needing it, and if they're running a Magnum Opus economy, they definitely won't have room for it.

In short, a I think Keyhole is probably a faction-defining card for Anarchs that just doesn't have much of a home in any of the other factions."

On the other hand, hypercubes involve *Euclidean* spaces, not Minkowski spaces, and both have very different properties. Generally speaking, a hypercube is an n-cube with n &gt; 3, though most people usually think of a tesseract, the 4-cube, when hearing the term hypercube.

rmigz,leagueoflegends,1389897773.0,"My honest opinion is that matters such as this should be handled on a case by case basis.

Obviously not every case of a player being late is black and white.  Hypothetically speaking, what if you had been hospitalized from a freak accident?  Would Riot then disqualify the team?  

Rigid rules about attendance are often times correct, however, there should be room for Riot to make an executive decision based on fact.  For example, in this case, it seems as though you can substantiate your claim of a DDOS attack against your ISP.  So this is somewhat of a ""rain delay"" scenario if you were to compare it to real sports.

For example, in outdoor sports, if weather conditions do not present a safe or hazard-free environment for a game to be held the game will be delayed or in some rare cases be rescheduled.  Something such as a DDOS attack against a service provider should, in my opinion, be treated the same as a weather delay would in outdoor sports.

Riot is doing a great job creating an environment for amateur teams to compete in preparation for the ""big show"", but at the same time they have to be mindful that hard rules can sometimes hinder the environment of competition because now a top challenger team is not able to compete and overall this will lower the skill floor of the league which reinforces a less competitive environment.

TLDR - Rules ought to have exception in some scenarios, this being one of them.

***Edit 1:***
It looks as though there are only 40 teams?  So less than 300 players, approximately?  Seems like there could be a very simple process to investigate scenarios like this using a ticket system, obviously a special one managed by the e-Sports arm of Riot.  There should be a Coke Zero League referee, umpire, official, whatever you want to call them, that can look into these matters and make rulings.  One step further, since the league is so small, the commissioner themselves can probably look into this type of complaint/issue with attendance.

***Edit 2:***
In reading Nick Allen's [official response](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1vdn6e/reason_gaming_disqualified_from_coke_league_how/cer9i4y), I feel that Riot is making a terrible decision under these circumstances.  Riot has failed to protect themselves from a DDoS attack in the past, so how can they ask a singular entity with a fraction of the financial resources to do more than what they themselves have been able to do?

I can't follow his logic as it doesn't make sense.  Reverting the ruling is not giving control to the DDoS attacker, in fact if the attack was intended against this player with the intention of derailing Reason Gaming's attempt to play in the Coke Zero League then they are in fact reinforcing the act of DDoS attacking the ISP as a successful means to game the system set in place by Riot.  Then, if you look at the other side, which is that this could have been a potentially unrelated instance of the ISP being attacked whereby this player is collateral damage then reverting the ruling is absolutely harmless.

**Trashy:**  As someone who can sympathize with your situation, on a long shot I would try to have your team's manager reach out to Coke Zero; PM if you want a direct link to their contact form.  I would just write a concise explanation as to how you feel Riot Games is poorly managing a Coke Zero sponsored event and how it has affected you as a participant.  Be sure to stress that you are a participant and that you feel that you've been cheated unjustly.  Someone has mentioned that missing this event will set you far behind on circuit points, which will further delay your opportunity to become a professional, so I don't see any reason to keep the gloves on if Riot isn't willing to take onus and revert a poor decision.  You have nothing to lose at this point.  Unfortunately, in some cases, hitting someone's wallet will inspire a different response.  If you can even get someone from Coke's sponsorship/advertising department to review how Riot is managing things it could potentially make things easier for the next set of Challenger teams or possibly improve your situation."

bananaruth,todayilearned,1389897889.0,"I also don't think it's possible for bedridden man who can barely move to rape anyone. Does that make me ablest? No, it's a physical limitation. I'm certainly not saying forced penetration couldn't be scarring for men. As I said, it is certainly a crime. I really dislike how you don't seem to even try to understand my points and assume I'm saying men can't be victims. Also, I specifically said that women *could* rape men - if they stuck something up their ass. You are just determined to disagree with everything I say. Most women don't want to hurt men or hate men.

There are a *ton* of things that I don't like about gender roles. Feminism ideally tries to correct them which is another area that helps both men and women. For instance, there is the issue that many things women have historically enjoyed or done are considered 'girly' and thus bad. That's why it is more acceptable for a woman to act manly than a man to act womanly. Being a man is good. Being a woman is bad. For example, men are expected to not show much emotion, since that is seen as feminine. I suspect this to be a large cause for the high rate of male suicide. Changing perceptions so that female traits are considered equally desirable as male traits would be a great boon for both men and women. 

I don't see how with the ""no one deserves anything philosophy"" you can justify doing anything for anyone. If you do, it would be randomly adjusting a non-existent set of cosmic scales. With that philosophy, I'd expect the people holding it to either own nothing or be trying to own everything they can at the expense of others. 

&gt; Give me an example, any example, of people's interests = men's interests.

Many of the topics that are hotly debated revolve around men. For instance, the death penalty is a very often discussed topic and it almost exclusively effects men. Almost 97% of people on death row are men. Sure it's in the people's interest morally speaking, but it doesn't affect many women. It's become less so, but almost all military decisions/laws/wars affect more men than women. The military and defense budget for the national government is huge. So what the people want (i.e. an end to conflict in the middle east) and what the government delivers on regarding the reduction or increase of troops overseas is largely men's interest.

&gt; but find me an article by a feminist in mainstream (hell, even jezebel or huffpo) media that speaks about a problem men have without trying to return the conversation to women and how they have it worse.

Well, they are women's organizations. Their goals are primarily to help women. The problems men have are often related and can be fixed by helping women, but aren't the main thing the group is going to talk about. Also, usually women do have it worse. I wish is weren't that way and that everyone was equal and crime and famine didn't exist, but we don't live in such a world. Despite your previous claim that you don't believe 'men have it worse than women', you clearly do.

tl;dr You are a broken record with a closed mind.

ajdeemo,DotA2,1389897931.0,"Here's the starting item build. The items you build later aren't dependent on where you start.

Side lane: Start with a stout shield, tango, salve, and fill the remaining slots with stats, maybe a clarity if you want. 

Mid lane: Start with a tango and two or three branches, save the rest for a quick bottle.

Jungle: Start with shield and quelling blade, as well as a set of tangoes.

As for skills, they're mostly the same. If you're in any lane, at level 7 you will want Overwhelming Odds maxed out with two levels in Press the Attack and one level in duel. After that, proceed to max out Press the Attack, and get Moment of Courage last.

If you start in the jungle, you will want to get one or two levels in Moment of Courage to sustain yourself, but no more. Get one level or two of Press the Attack, then max Overwhelming Odds as soon as possible, grabbing Duel whenever you can.

As for items, usually LC will want to get utility items rather than damage ones. This is because you will get bonus damage from duel anyways, and many effects such as evasion and attack modifiers don't work during duel anyways.

Blink is usually better than Shadowblade. This is because Duel has such a short range, you need the precision. Blink can get you duels that shadowblade would otherwise cause you to miss. Also, with Blink, you can use your buff on yourself then immediately blink into a duel to get the max benefit. It is much harder to do this with a shadowblade. Finally, you pick legion commander for her duel, and no other reason. This means you need blink to make the most out of duel. Enigma, Tidehunter, and Magnus don't get shadowblade because they're picked for only one skill as well. If LC is getting countered by sentries, then shadowblade is dead weight.

After that, it mostly depends on what is needed. Armlet gives you a respectable amount of survivability and damage, Black King Bar ensures that you won't get disabled by conventional means, Assault Cuirass is just an all around good item, Blade mail is useful lategame against carries, heart gives you all around survivability, etc."

You're removing the 2nd TD and ensuing 2 pointer from the equation.  You still need to get the 2, just with less time.  If you make the 2 pointer, it doesn't matter which order.  But if you miss the 2 pointer you have 2 scenarios:

If you went for it the first time:  Now you're down by 9 with a few minutes on the clock.  You can try an onside kick and try for a miracle comeback.  You're in rough shape, but still alive.  

If you went for it the second time:  You're down by 2 with a few seconds on the clock and kicking off.  Game over.

Daiteach,brooklynninenine,1389898187.0,"I feel like what's critical is that however the handle the situation, it's not allowed to dominate what either character is about. When Jim and Pam officially got together on The Office, it allowed for a couple of immediate short term payoffs (they're officially together, they're getting married, etc.), but it really sank both characters. While Jim at least had some traits aside from the relationship dynamic, it wasn't much, and Pam, a chronically underdeveloped character, felt almost pointless. Once the show got them together, it took it *years* to figure out anything interesting to do with either of them. (Although there were a few false starts in different directions.)

I honestly wouldn't mind if the show kept them in a low-level holding pattern for a while, sort of a work-spouse situation, filtered through the characters' personalities. ""Will they or won't they"" situations get a bad rap, and they deserve it in many cases (particularly where the answer is ""they will"" and it's clear that the show is just stringing things out, but I think they work just fine as long as the interplay between the characters is actually entertaining, and not just a formality while you're waiting for the show to resolve the relationship arc and grab that payoff.

Sharkictus,TrueChristian,1389898242.0,"Reading through the review of that was interesting. 

I do wish there was more Protestant liturgical churches around. I do think Catholics have some things theologically wrong, and I do disagree with their basis of authority.

IMO, I think there are lost liturgies outside of the one we use. I think liturgies are essentially a back and forth song that teaches about certain aspects of theological doctrines, especially useful for the illiterate back in the day (though it use went away when Church for most it's history decided not to have it in local languages for understandability) .

I think if Protestant non-denoms want liturgy, they should write out multi doctrine back and forth songs with some amount of artistic symbolism actions for the lead (pastor) to do.

Lluxx,changemyview,1389898552.0,"There's a few different levels to this so I apologise if it seems rambly. 

Firstly, there's the difference between feeling unhappy about the way you look and actually having a disorder. Everybody has things they don't like about themselves. It only qualifies as body dysmorphic disorder [when](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/body-dysmorphia/Pages/Introduction.aspx)

&gt; The person believes they are ugly or defective and that others perceive them in this way, despite reassurances from others about their appearance.

Everybody has things about their appearance which distress them, but not to the extent of a disorder. I believe people have a right to spend their money on what they wish, so if someone finds relief from their distress by spending excess money on anti-aging creams, who am I to judge? 

However, let's take age-distress to the level of a body dysmorphic disorder sufferer. Let's say that we have somebody who is fixated on their aging. They can't foster relationships, they believe they are unspeakably disgusting due to their aging and are desperate to find a way to stop it. But, with BDD, medical treatment (such as cosmetic surgery) is unlikely to alleviate their distress. Because they are suffering from a chronic illness: their distress is due to a chemical imbalance in their brain, not due to their aging. If they get plastic surgery to remove injections, dye their hair and dress younger, they will simply find something else to fixate on because that is the nature of the disorder. So while they are within their rights to spend their money on all these things, it won't help them. They require treatment in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy and medication (according to the NHS website linked above) to truly relieve their distress. 

Now let's compare this to gender identity disorder. Although trans people may still suffer negative social consequences if people find out about their status, the dysphoria itself - and the list of negative feelings which come with it - is alleviated by transitioning. It's not the same as BDD, where the sufferer will still have it even after they fix their perceived flaw; once trans people are accepted as their preferred gender and can live as it, their suffering goes away. 

Both of these groups of people are suffering due to their appearances, essentially, but whilst trans people can alleviate their symtpoms by transitioning, BDD sufferers cannot alleviate their symptoms by surgical (or otherwise) methods. So the best course of action for each group is very different. "

partspace,AskFeminists,1389898566.0,"It seems that one of the core tenets of the Men's Rights Movement is that it is anti-feminist. If you visit the MRA subreddit, they link to an article as their viewpoint on feminism: (Edit to remove link)

&gt;**There can be no common ground.** [between feminism and MRA's]

&gt;I say this because there is only one way common ground can be reached between the MRM and the feminist movement. Feminists will have to first acknowledge that their movement has spread anti-male bigotry throughout western governments. Whether they want to blame it on “radicals” or “second wavers” or feminist subdivision C subsection 12. It really doesn’t matter which feminists they want to point the finger at, as long as they acknowledge that Feminism is the reason these laws exist.

[According to Wikipedia: 
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_rights_movement)
&gt;The men's rights movement is considered to be a backlash or countermovement to feminism. The men's rights movement consists of diverse points of view which reject feminist and profeminist ideas. Men's rights activists have said that they believe that feminism has overshot its objective and harmed men. They dispute that men as a group have institutional power and privilege and believe that men are victimized and disadvantaged relative to women.

&gt;Men's rights activists see men as an oppressed group and believe that society and state have been ""feminized"" by the women's movement.

The men's rights movement exists in direct opposition to feminism. They exist because they believe that feminism is wrong and harmful. 

Feminism largely *agrees* with many of the issues that MRA's bring up, the inequality and unfairness that men face from the draft, to male rape, to child custody. While feminists point to the patriarchy as the cause, MRA's seem to blame *feminism* for the majority of it. The modern MRM was already founded on an adversarial relationship with feminism. "
gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskWomen,1389898572.0,"I never gave it any thought before I got engaged. I was never one to fantasize about things like my wedding day or how he proposed...do you know, it took me weeks of looking at wedding dresses online before I had an idea of what sort of dress style I liked? 

He ended up proposing publicly and it was great fun. I loved it. But he knew me well enough to know I'd be okay with that, and we had discussed marriage before that point and both of us knew that we wanted to be married and be together for life. In my opinion, those are the things you must consider if you are planning a public proposal: is she the sort of woman who hates being the center of attention - is she shy or introverted? have you two discussed marriage already, and do you know for sure that she wants to marry you and would say yes? If you're not sure she would like a public engagement, find one of those ""viral video"" public engagement things and watch it together, and see what she says. Be subtle about it so she won't know that's what you're doing, too!  : )

But these ""groups"" will operate as gangs, much like any other nation where there is no institutional control. ""Groups"" will fight over territory and resources. If one group is blocking another from something they want, a dispute will erupt - and in most cases it will be bloody.

Are you implying large groups don't fight over territory and resources?  That's war.  That's human nature.  It's going to happen either way and lots of people will die.  Unless you think you have a way to solve war? 

&gt;The Walking Dead might be a silly show, but I do think they nail the politics of small, self-governed groups fairly well. Some groups are like that of the Governor, where everything is perfect until it isn't because the people in the group discover the truth of what is going on behind the scenes. Rick's group works pretty well because there hasn't been a major abuse of power, but they are always teetering on collapse as people in the group make choices for the group without the group's knowledge.

Sounds like a good reason not to leave your country.  Or to band together with larger groups.  Or to make deals for the common defense.  Andorra is right between France and Spain yet hasn't been conquered by either.  

If people could secede as they please country size would act as a free market.  People could join together and make governments at the size that pleased them and met their needs.  Eventually these countries would reach a manageable size.

&gt; I'd be interested in hearing about how your dystopian world would work. Perhaps there is a novel you prefer that accurately describes your belief of how a ""free"" world would play out?

How is this dystopian?  I'm saying I see no intrinsic value in ""keeping a nation together.""  If some people didn't want to be a part of it, then they should feel free to form their own country.  The US split from Britain and it wasn't dystopian.  Same thing just a different scale.  

In fact I'd call keep the country together at all costs despite dissent as significantly more dystopian.

popisfizzy,woahdude,1389898611.0,"You know how you can have a line? Let's refer to some point on that line, as X, and we can write it as X = 0, or X = 1/2, or X = 1. There are infinitely many, in both directions. Imagine we put another line at a right angle to it, and write a point on that line as Y, with Y = -1 or Y = 0 or Y = 1 or Y = -pi or whatever. Once again, there are infinitely many points. If we write an ordered pair of these (X, Y), then we have a two-dimensional plan, and the point (X, Y) is moving over on the line A a certain amount, and moving up or down B a certain amount.

Well, let's throw in a third line, so that it goes *through* the plane of AB we just set up, at a right angle. This line we'll call this line Z, and once again we can choose a particular location on it. You can look at Z as sort of indexing planes. For example, imagine you have a stack of papers, and the first paper is Z = 1, the second is Z = 2, and so on. Each paper can have different points marked on it, and so you could refer to point (X_1, Y_1) on Z = 1, or (X_2, Y_2) on Z = 2, and so on. Well, we can write this as an ordered triplet, (X, Y, Z). Z is sort of arranging these planes, and the planes have their own set of points. (The way this construction works, you could use X or Y as the index, as well). As it turns out, the amount of numbers you have to use to refer to a single point in something like this is an important number, called the *dimension* of the space. For example, in a line you only need one number, so it's one-dimensional. For a plane, you need two numbers, so it's two-dimensional. And a space needs three, so it's three dimensional.

Well, see how this construction is kind of generalizable? Let's consider something with four numbers (called a 4-tuple or a quadrulpet): (X, Y, Z, W). W is kind of indexing entire spaces, so W = 1 is the 'first' space, W = 2 is the 'second' space, and so on. You might ask where is the line for this at? Well, it's passing through the space at a right angle. This one is kind of hard to grasp, because you can't look at it in three dimensions, just like finding a line that goes through a plane at a right angle requires three dimensions, not two. But in a four-dimensional space, it works just fine.

Basically, that's what the fourth dimension refers to*. It's a way of arranging spaces in the same way a space is a way of arranging planes, and in the same way a plane is arranging lines.

*Well, a fourth Euclidean dimension. People sometimes describe time as a fourth dimension, but that's in a different context."

I tend to get similarly frustrated, because people, generally men, often don't seem willing to even give me/women the benefit of the doubt, or to believe that we know what we're talking about, that what we're saying could actually be true, and that systemic bias could really be happening.

When you're the dominant group, it's easy to not see the bias that doesn't affect you. I'm female, but I'm also straight and white, which I think puts me in a cool position to understand both the dominant and disempowered positions. "

However, I bought a Slim a few days ago because my Elite was about to die (very weird noises like the motor for the internal fan was about to crap out and getting quite hot), and I've noticed that the casings of DataTraveler sticks are too big. I had no problems fitting two of them next to each other into the USB ports on the front of my Elite, but the ports are closer together on the Slim so I can plug in only one. And it's a similar problem with the USB ports on the back of the Slim; the Xbox's casing gets in the way, so you have to use quite slim flash drives. I'm using a couple of [32 GB Platinum USB 2.0 sticks](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Platinum-177561-32GB-Flash-Drive/dp/B001K4E3W6/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389898468&amp;sr=8-16&amp;keywords=usb+platinum+32+2.0) now, and they're small enough so you can fit three of them into the ports on the back of the Slim, and/or two of them at the front."

They need very different treatments.

The right thing to do would be for Riot to allow you into the league if you can substantiate your claim that you were unable to perform due to service outage.  

Service outage is such a common thing that it's almost easy to predict this sort of thing from Riot's point of view.  Generally speaking, it's also difficult to receive concrete proof that service outage 1) was outside of the control of those affected; and 2) actually happened which directly hindered a person or team's ability to perform.

I used to be an admin for an online Counter-Strike league, at the time the largest in America, called Cyberathlete Amateur League (CAL) and also played in their top Invite division (similar to Challenger in LoL).  Both as a player and an admin, I ran into this sort of thing on multiple occasions (this was 10 years ago, so stability was often an issue with internet providers).

We had a process by which teams that were a part of the league could schedule matches based on availability, so the control of when and where a match would happen (server selection) was totally in the player's control within a time frame of one week.  Then, if someone couldn't make it, the team benefiting from a forfeit win could A) re-schedule with the team of the week; or B) accept a forfeit win, giving a forfeit loss to the team not able to perform, but the winning team would need to replay to earn a normal win as forfeit wins carried less weight for playoff consideration.  So the system created inspired less gamesmanship by giving teams less incentive to accept forfeit wins.

*..Bad memories..*

a huge opening night, blockbuster crowds. 11 year old me scoring tickets to a sneak preview of the most hyped up beyond anything reasonable movie of the decade, nigh, the century. 

I couldn't wait for the movie to come out after they started hyping it, so i read the book. It was over my head, but got me thinking about huge topics and fanned the kindling flames of a love of science fiction that has grown into an all consuming passion as i've aged.

And then the movie starts.. The boy is younger than the girl? What, where is the waterfall/white water rapids the HBO ""making of"" special gave me peeks of? Where are the natural eggs?!? What is this monstrosity!?!?

I walked into that theater with all the hopes and dreams of an 11 year old boy and walked out a distanced cynical bastard.

benk4,nfl,1389899596.0,"The second bullet point is the superior strategy because you gain something very valuable, knowlege.  

Down 8 points is technically a 1 score game, but it's really kind of a 1.5 score game as the 2 point conversion is anything but certain.  If you get the 2 pointer it was a one score game.  If you miss it you still need another score.  So half the time it's 1 score, half the time it's 2.  

What going for 2 early does is establishes whether it's actually a one score game or a 2 score game.  Then you can adjust further strategy to reflect this, you can choose to onside kick, you can play hurry-up, you can kick a field goal in a tight spot, and you can go for 4th downs.  If you were to kick you delay the knowledge of this until later.  You could play as if you were down 1 score, get a late TD and then find out you actually needed 2 scores when you miss the 2 point conversion.  It ties your hands to one strategy which you aren't certain is the correct strategy and won't find out until it's too late.  

So if the attempted 2 point conversion is good, it's irrelevant.  If the attempted 2 point is no-good you're probably screwed either way, but there is an advantage to be gained knowing whether you need the extra score or not."

Otherwise, it's fair game. If I ""have to go to the back"" because I'm taller than you, then the same logic should apply to everyone, leaving only 5'0 people in the front rows.

I very rarely have encountered anyone who was rude or angry, since that's not the vibe I give off.

Lluxx,changemyview,1389900007.0,"[GID sufferers have brains which resemble the sex they feel they are, not the one they were born as](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v378/n6552/abs/378068a0.html) so it's not really a chemical imbalance (causing irrational behaviour) because they have a perfectly healthy, sane brain; it's their body which does not match it. If we have the ability to allow them to live as their healthy brain would feel best as, why should we deny them that?

Possible? Yes, I suppose. Have I ever heard of it in my interactions with trans people offline or online? No. Never. Could you provide sources of trans people who transition and then feel they are still not masculine or feminine enough and continue to suffer from dysphoria?

Gender is deeper than appearance. Yes, GID is caused by chemicals in the same way that pretty much everything about your sense of self is caused by chemicals. But they do not suffer from irrational, harmful thought patterns like someone with BDD. It's ""My brain drives me to despise something about myself so I despise that I'm getting old, but if I fix that I'll find something else to despise"" (not that a BDD sufferer would ever think that consciously, but for the sake of argument) and ""I feel like a woman and when I look in the mirror I don't look like I feel. I despise looking and being treated like a man but if I look and am treated like a woman this will go away.""

Incidently, [this](http://en.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1uy91r/i_do_not_think_transsexuality_should_be_part_of/cemz4ab) user makes a similar argument to me, but says they actually worked in the field, so their experience of post-transition trans people's lack of dysphoria probably counts for something. 

Edit: Something which might help to make my view clearer is the fact that I believe the main aim for an individual suffering from any kind of disorder is healing them and ending the suffering caused by the disorder. For BDD sufferers, surgery will not heal them while CBT stands a chance, whereas for GID sufferers surgery will stop their distress. 

You, on the other hand, seem to be arguing that even though GID sufferers can essentially be 'cured' by transitioning, they should instead completely re-wire their brains to fit the body they don't feel is right for their identity and 'accept it', as you put it originally. I imagine (I can look for sources if you wish, or you could read anecdotes from real trans people) that forcing a trans person to attempt to change their internal gender is about as successful as gay conversion therapy (i.e. not at all), so you're essentially denying them a treatment which is proven to work. 

Let's apply that logic to other disorders, say, depression. You have crippling depression - you feel worthless, unloved, can't connect with people, can't talk with anyone, can hardly motivate yourself to get out of bed in the morning. One day you learn that you're not inherently worthless and deserving of misery, but there is something wrong with your brain that is making you feel these things and you ask me for help. I say, ""There're pills available to help you, and therapy. These things have worked on many people in your condition before and made them much happier. But I think you should really just accept that this is how you are and get over it.""

In this situation, I'd be beyond callous. Obviously (and unlike transitioning for gender dysphoria) medication and therapy are not always successful for depressed people, but if we have the ability to at least try to help you, who am I to refuse and say you should just accept your suffering? ""Other people have just sucked it up and got on with things,"" I say when you protest, ""You just need to change your attitude and be more positive. That's what I do whenever I feel a bit down."" 

Different treatments work for different problems. Each treatment must act on the cause of the problem to cure it. For a depressed person or someone with BDD, they will likely need antidepressants and CBT, because the chemicals in their brains are imbalanced and therefore treating the symptoms of the problem will not fix the imbalance. For someone with GID, their brain is healthy and therefore it seems irrational to deny them a highly effective treatment. If you can provide reasons why trans people should continue to live with their dysmorphia and not transition when it would relieve it, I'm all ears. "

Its not to say they are bad players but they don't have quite enough of a skillset to really excel at the slots we keep trying to put them in.

Chadli on the other hand, has just enough of those skills to go in and play well at a variety of positions.  Maybe never starring anywhere, but solid and productive.

""My uncle is still alive and living in that house! Let him do what he wants with it all!"" It's what all the cousins said, and we held ourselves to it. My parents were so proud that none of the grandkids were greedy, but how could we be? Our uncle lost his mother, and his father and all of his siblings were dead.

Distant relatives who never saw grandma were asking about her car and grand piano and other expensive shit. Fuck those guys.

Then, when my dad died, I thought I could trust my brother and mom to be cool. After all, mom is still alive and in the house, and we can get similar mementos like we did from Grandma. I got a hat and a flannel jacket... My brother stole a 10K diamond ring from my Dad and then was angry when we gave the guns to the police (none of us have a pistol license and my brother is a criminal, so we couldn't leave the guns in the safe when Dad died in any sort of good conscience) and he couldn't steal those too.

2 of my sisters got NOTHING, and the only reason the other did is because she asked constantly. For a sweatshirt, which my mom begrudged her. My mom will still act like it's weird that sister wanted a sweatshirt of his, even though that's pretty much exactly what I wanted, too. The difference? My sisters are her stepdaughters, so they don't matter.

dusmeyedin,confession,1389900401.0,"""Common sense"" is the term given by people who have known something for such a long time that they have forgotten the fact that they had to learn it in the first place, and they now have difficulty believng that it might not be known to other people elsewhere, or empathizing with them when they have to learn it for the first time.

This is an unjust assumption in most cases, but it's doubly damaging for people living with behavioral problems, for whom nonverbal and subtle indicators are often insufficient signs to convey a message.

Thus, by taking the viewpoint of ""common sense renders this an unnecessary and meritless observation"", you're discouraging people from offering frank help to the demographic who needs it the most.

I'm sorry to have to point it out to you so bluntly, but I thought it was ""common sense""."

PrometheusGXX,HunterXHunter,1389900629.0,"I think you can chalk this stuff up to using mixed nen types.  There are very few abilities that use only a single nen type.  When they are single nen types they are extremely basic (with the exception of conjuration).  Not all abilities in the manga are explicitly explained which is why their descriptions can be somewhat confusing.  I think we can conclude that Shoot's ability is a mixture of Manipulation and Conjuration unless he is manipulating three clay hands and a cage he bought at a pet store.  This would explain why his cage has these kinds of properties.  Also, it is not unusual to use nen types opposite of your category if it is done in a basic manner.  For example, Knuckle is an Emitter yet he uses a ability that includes conjuration.  You might notice that most Conjurers keep their conjured objects either in contact with them or within close proximity.  This is because they are terrible Emitters.  However, since they are Conjurers their objects tend to be fairly complex, even seeming to have developed their own personalities to various degrees.  Knuckle's ability, being high in Manipulation, allows his conjured object (Potclean) to be at very far distances.  Potclean itself however is a very simple conjured object.  It's orders are simply to follow the target around and enter them into Zetsu if they lose the game.  You could argue that Potclean is performing calculations but I believe that the calculations are really being done on Knuckle's end.  So, in the end I don't see why Illumi wouldn't use basic transformation/conjuration to simply alter the color of his hair or something.

That's at least my take on the matter."

3. Unfortunately vectors and strings were put too late and syntactic sugar like vector list initializers came too late and stuff like that was never really adopted. Look at Java or C# for an example of well used types in standard library, everyone uses String and everything is compatible with it, you'd have to have very strong reasons not to use it.

CadHuevFacial,AskWomen,1389900840.0,"I'm sorry you're being downvoted so much. I think about perspectives like yours a lot and the struggle I'd think many men face in reconciling the behavior they've been taught is socially expected of them and their loyalty to what behaviors feel more 'right'. As a woman I really believe it to be awful that young boys and men are so conditioned to be hard and in control of themselves at all times, and that they're told that to be sensitive and compassionate are weaker and therefore secondary traits that should be shown sparingly. 

It's so painfully obvious to me that the cultural institutions that pressure/condition women to be demure, submissive, tender, and nurturing are the same institutions that pound into men that to be any of those things makes one less of a man and therefore 'undesirable'. However, as women become more empowered to achieve the same privileged status men in modern society have and shed the antiquated gender roles expected of them economically, socially, sexually, etc., there is a strong tendency toward desiring men who are equally progressive in their rejection of traditional gender roles as well. 

IMO, saying we don't care 'how alpha you are' really means we care more about whether you are/are not interested in redefining what masculinity and femininity mean to you enough to sincerely and confidently embrace those gendered characteristics you've always felt entitled to, but which society has excluded you from. As a woman looking to redefine what I want and what I'm capable of despite what society expects from me, I want a man who understands that (for example) crying, showing interest in 'girly' things, feeling strong emotions, wanting to be a stay at home dad with a partner who is a breadwinner, doing the laundry, whatever, *does not make him any less of a man*. Those qualities tell me that he truly considers me an equal because he understands the importance *all* human qualities, not just typically male ones, have in our society, and it means he inherently values me as a *person* first, and a *woman* second.

Mr_Diggums,AskMen,1389900854.0,"If you're banging, but haven't mutually agreed that you're exclusive, then he should be more than happy to wear a condom. If you haven't yet banged, he should wear (and should know he HAS TO wear) a condom. As mentioned, any ""no"" or refusal is a HUGE red flag early on. You're willing to have sex with this guy, the least he can do is practice safe sex.

Frankly, I don't see how a smart/rational guy would expect to have sex with a new potential partner without a condom...sure, after we're exclusive and know we're clean we can graduate to the holy grail of condom-free boogie, but early on it is a no brainer.

**TL;DR** When it's getting heated, ask ""Do you have a condom?"" because it is basically telling him you want to bang. If he refuses, run away. If he has one/you have one, bang away."

There was no legitimate channel through which Snowden could have reported the abuses and had them addressed - the NSA (all the way up to the Director of National Intelligence) had been deliberately lying to the very bodies that were supposed to have oversight of it.

To me, the first thing that stuck out was the obsession with food. Food should be a way to fuel your body to do the things you want to do. It shouldn't drive your every thought and decision. 

If you think about things logically, eating a slice of cake won't make you instantly gain weight. One bowl of mac and cheese is not going to make or break your eating or exercise plan. It should not make you feel guilty. Maybe just focus on eating slower and stopping when you're satisfied not full. While you may only have some symptoms now, you could easily get carried away into a full blown eating disorder.

Throwing up or starving yourself is never healthy. Just do a little googling to see how this can affect your body and overall health. You should look at *why* you feel the need to control these things and monitor the feelings rather than the food."

They also demand an absurd amount of praise for treating people who they're keeping malnourished and under threat of death in perpetuity.

&gt; Neglect to mention that a study showed that Arab-Israeli's would rather be living in Israel than be living in other Arab countries.

One study determines the opinion of the entirety of the Palestinians living in Israel?

I get that it's advantageous for Israelis to pretend that Arab countries in general are dominated by extremists or are otherwise dirt poor and miserable, but that's just simply not the case. Not by a long shot.

&gt; Neglect to mention that the current far right policies of Israel are the minority, and that an overwhelming majority of people want a different way to deal with the current problems in the region.

Actually, the Israelis who're interested in serious peace or a fair peace seem to be in the distinct minority.

The majority are either Palestinian-hating rightists, expansionist likudniks, or these apathetics who do admittedly go across the political spectrum on different issues, but only actually care about the situation with the Palestinians if some IDF gets shot in the head-- and then it's ""the evil murderous Palestinians"" and their ""violent ways"".

I'm not outright saying there aren't any Israelis who are in favour of dealing with the process properly and fairly, but they aren't even a plurality.

Well, they seem to hate the Palestinians far more then they hate the settlements and the settlers, don't they?

At the level of national politics, you can't even get broad agreement on the issues that are clear cut black and white.  A substantial element of each party would rather sabotage the other than get anything constructive done.

At the individual level, much of the problem is that demagogues on each side have spent so much effort demonizing their opponents and all who support them, that reasoned discussion becomes difficult.

When you're absolutely certain the person cutting the pie is evil, it is very easy to see the slices as unequal and the distribution of them as partisan, even if neither is true."

I know you feel like you are in love, but please take a step back here and try to examine this situation rationally. What kind of 31 year old man tries to date and marry a teenager? Answer: the kind that wants a woman they can easily manipulate and bend to their will. Why do you think he is going after a teenager rather than a woman closer to his own age? Answer: for whatever reason, women nearer to his age know better. 

Please listen to your parents. They only want the best for you. I know it seems like they are shitting on your happiness right now, but they just don't want the child they love to end up in a terrible situation you can't extract yourself from. 

Please google stories about young women like yourself marrying older Muslim men who suddenly come to find that their ""amazing"" husband is not so amazing, end up in an abusive marriage, move with their husband to his home country and become trapped there, have their children taken away, etc.

benk4,nfl,1389902261.0,"&gt; That's just completely wrong. Offense is unarguably less exertion than defense. And Defenses don't generally have separate players for goal-line (obviously exceptions may apply as every team is different). Especially in today's offenses where teams are much more prone to pass from the 1 yard line you still need all of your corners and line-backers. Keeping your offense out early in the game is a huge advantage later in the game.

The first part is true, but the offense is more tired too.  But goalline packages are different.  Usually there's more D lineman and fewer safeties, the precise positions that are least and most likely to tire out.  I don't think this makes a large difference on 1 play from the goal line though.  Having the knowledge earlier is a much bigger edge.

&gt; Knowing the outcome doesn't help at all.  It limits what you can do and defenses know what to plan for.

It limits what you can do, but assures that you're doing the right thing!  Look at the field goal example from the article.  If you're down 8, you don't know if kicking is the right call or not because you don't know how the 2 point conversion is going to play out.  You don't know whether to take your time or to play hurry up ball.  You don't know whether to onside kick or to kick deep.  You don't know whether to play for the turnover or play for the 3 and out.  You don't know a ton of things.  Going for 2 lets you know the optimum strategy earlier in the game.  If you kick you're tied into playing as if you're going to make the 2 point conversion.  Which is anything but certain.  

&gt; I'm just shocked that your argument is that coaches need less options like they are going to somehow get confused if they have the ability to do multiple things.

That's not my argument at all.  But nice try.  "

Edit: Who knows, maybe Shoot is a beginner Specialist.

According to Hunterpedia Potclean is a mixture of Manipulation and Conjuration.  It's underneath a section titled ""Nen"" and directly above the explanation for his nen abilities.

Kastro was a great example of why not to rely on opposing categories.  However, I don't believe the lesson was to rely on only neighboring categories.  In Kastro's circumstance he was using a nen ability that exclusively used Manipulation and Conjuration (unless the double used his wolf fist or whatever it was called).  I think the lesson is instead to make the focus of an ability your nen type and use the other nen types to supplement the ability.

If the warranty expires, they are replaced regardless of capability.  If a machine's load extends past it's capacity to handle it, then a review is done to see if the workload can be rebalanced, if new hardware is needed, or if the workload degradation is reasonable and can be handled as-is until the next time perf is revisited.

For labs and test environments, since most workload is virtual nowadays the hardware doesn't matter as much.  Unless there's a need for the hardware to match between test and prod (sometimes that happens, but not always), hardware is retained until it dies."

I'd say he's been characterized as a manipulator, though - even if it's not malicious (and don't get me wrong, he loves his friends), he knows how to act to try to get people to think and do what he wants. He also *appears* honest, but is in fact rather dishonest emotionally; the way he acted when he told Chisaki he loved her seemed proof of that, as he said it in a very perfunctory, matter-of-fact manner. He reminds me, in a way, of Koizumi from *Haruhi* - always with a smile as a mask, to the very end (literally; when he got thrown off the boat due to the pier support collapsing in episode 13, he was smiling at Chisaki even as he got dragged into the water.) There was only one scene where he seemed to be totally honest, which was when everyone else ran out of the old classroom after he asked Hikari what he felt for Manaka (episode 11 or 12) - he sat back, sighed and looked dejected at what he'd done.

He's the kind of guy you can turn to for advice, but if you ask him what's on his mind, all you'll get is a smile and wave - contrast to Hikari, who wears his heart on his sleeve. "

Gl33m,AskReddit,1389902882.0,"The initial article linked really just reinforces the concept that women being more nurturing than men is completely societal. Arguably, yes, women are more nurturing. But they're not more nurturing innately. We teach women to be nurturing and then we teach men not to be nurturing. And that's why women are more nurturing than men.

But that's not evidence that women are more nurturing than men innately. The article strongly suggests that if you were to raise a male and a female side-by-side the exact same way, neither would be more nurturing than the other. The best argument you have here is that women are more attached to their children. And the only evidence that points to that is:

&gt;[Oxytocin] is produced in women during labor and lactation in women and is believed to trigger bonding and nurturing behaviors.

And the study doesn't actually say anyone's even bothered to test men's oxytocin production while their child is newly born and in infancy. Until I know that their production isn't higher, I have to assume it's directly possible.

Finally, circumstantial evidence is not the kind of evidence that convinces me. Circumstantial evidence is only relevant via inference. It's difficult  to have inference without bias. A set of corroborating evidence build on circumstantial evidence is more relevant, providing all circumstantial evidence is included, and it still builds into corroborating evidence. Even then, inference is still performed.

Even including principals such as Occam's Razor, bias still sets in. What we perception as the simplest solution is only simplest due to our perception.

TL:DR, this really proves nothing. Even the articles this links to proves nothing. This isn't even close to definitive evidence, and really just makes me more firmly believe that men and women are just as nurturing as one another, and society's views that women *should* be more nurturing simply creates a feedback loop."

Maybe you can ask your professor if he'd be interested in using something like that to help him write his letter.

If he's not into that, and if he really doesn't know you, then you can ask him if he has time to chat with you about your ambitions. You can talk to him about why you want to go to grad school, what you liked about his class, what you hope to study or research in grad school, and why you think you'd be a good grad student. Then he can work that stuff into his letter.

I don't think DDoS can be prevented anymore than a lightning storm can be, all you can do is wait it out which is my point.  Riot should allow a grace period to wait out this type of issue.

My wife and I have been trying for years...and have had more then our full share of heart breaks already.  I should be the father of 4...I am still waiting to be able to celebrate my first father's day.

No matter what you choose it will follow you forever.  Keep the child and you will have the constant reminder of what your life could have been.  Don't worry about your family...they will want to be involved in the child's life.  It would be very hypocritical of them to punish the child for your mistake/random chance.  

I can tell you the due dates of every child that we should have had.  Even though it was not our fault for the miscarriages the guilt still haunts us.  4 times a year our house get very depressed at what we could have had.  That is something that I can only imagine is worse when you abort the child.  Every year for the rest of your life on the due date you will have thought at what could have been.

There will also be some plot holes when playing as Ezio in the 3rd game of his series, Revelations.

I personally did not enjoy AC3 as much, but I would still strongly recommend playing it before 4. That's just me, I know a lot of people did like it though.

I agree with /u/30rockette that I don't think this is a popular product, so here's my heresy review: Shadows are nothing to write home about and if you're used to mid-range/high-end brands expect disappointment. A big con is the size of the palette which said person has nicknamed ""the breadbox."" The lip products are really bad and have little to no pigmentation. 

For the two other products I tried to click on the links but it said the product was sold out :( If you're looking for some colorful eyeshadows to play around with, I would definitely check out some of the other suggestions you've received, and also perhaps some indie eyeshadows for samples.

James_GAF,BasicIncome,1389904030.0,"I'm not an economist either, just have a background that includes more than average mathematics and computer science. Over the years I've learned quite a bit, but certainly do not understand everything and could be mistaken. However, the nature of a wealth tax strikes me as very difficult since so much of it is just paper wealth on the ownership of paper. Your approach greatly expands the types of wealth which are taxed.

Since so much of what the ultra wealthy own is stock and their fortunes directly tied to stock it seems to me a sizable wealth tax would necessitate a vast transfer of assets to meet obligations. Some could probably extract from the operating revenues of their corporations. Perhaps even donate many assets to charity. Neither of which seem to me a terribly constructive year 1 arrangements. The first likely takes cash out of working people's pockets. The second makes for a shortfall due to a corporate transfer encouraging concentration of wealth in entities which are not taxed on wealth.

I'm not saying I'm certain of this, just that this is some of the possibilities I see in reaction to a wealth tax of this size expanding to include all capital assets. Perhaps a gradual slope over a period of a couple of decades coupled with normalization of capital gains rates to the same levels as progressive income tax would be more tolerable for the market. This would allow adjustment to a new reality rather than a shock, but it certainly will change the nature of the system when the accumulation of assets by an individual dictates taxation. 

I think the goal is worthwhile in reducing long term inequality. I'm just not so convinced the path there is quite so simple as passing a wealth tax which greatly expands what is taxed in a given year."

TexasWithADollarsign,PoliticalDiscussion,1389904086.0,"&gt; If something is made illegal, you cannot prosecute those who did it when it was legal.

Yes.

&gt; Similarly, if something is made legal, you cannot un-prosecute those who previously broke the law. To do so is to violate the integrity of the law in the eyes of most legal experts.

Now, here's where legal waters can get muddied. IANAL, but I know there's a form of *ex post facto* laws, called ""amnesty laws"" or *in mitius* laws, that does this.  While they are technically *ex post facto*, I don't know if there's precedent in the United States that tests the legality and constitutionality of *removing* a sentence once a law is repealed.

Personally, I think there really isn't any constitutional crisis.  The Constitution prohibits *ex post facto* laws in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3. However, if the law making pot illegal is repealed... then technically it's not an *ex post facto* law because the law no longer exists, and legally people should be released."

As I wrote, I don't think that non-heterosexual people who really love each other have to avoid relationships/intercourse, as long as there is some together-life project (and the child's project who's going to append inevitably : IMO, if it's god's love, you'll want a kid to share it sooner or later). That's why I call bullshit everything about the need of ""a dad and a mom"" or anything forbidding homosexual wedding.


I really think that many christians think quite the same as I do (many of my catholic friends and my family does). I know it's not the Vatican's line, maybe nor the dominating line between christians, but I consider the Church as a community of humans, who can be wrong about some things (even the Pope is human and not always infaillible). 

I clearly don't like some parts of the Church, but I know it's base is good, despite the use made of it by many ""christians"". If disgusted people leave it, only the disgusting ones will stay there, and it desserves better.

I think this can be overcome.  You both want to feel wanted and want that expressed in different ways.  You're initiation ""switches"" to borrow at BDSM term.  So you guys should take turns ! Tell you him want him to come and just ""take you"" sometimes and work on showing him that you want him.  

Approach it like a job - maintenance sex is important.  We get fed a lot of stuff about how sex is only supposed to happen when both partners are burning with passion, but in reality, sometimes it's better to go ahead and have sex even if you're not really 'in the mood'.  In my experience at least, crappy sex or quickie sex still leaves me feeling better than no sex, even if I wasn't initially interested in having it.  And for women at least (and I think often or men too) having it makes you want more of it.  Not immediately after, but longer-term.  It's like getting regular exercise.  You may not want to do it that much but you feel much better after you did and more positive (usually) about doing it the next day.

You could also try a sex challenge - agreeing to have sex no matter what !! (barring illness, extreme disruption to schedule, emergency, etc) for a set number of days in a row, or at least for a set number of nights a week.  Say ""Hey, we are both attracted to each other, and we both want more sex, so we're gonna have sex 3 times a week, no matter what.  That means if we go 5 days without sex, we'll have a lot to squeeze in on the weekend!""  Try it and see how it changes things, especially wrt initiation on both your ends.

Also I think leaving sex as the thing you do before you sleep is the best killer of sex in a situation where both partners have normal libidos.  It's very often a crappy time to have sex.  Try it as a stress reliever as soon as you get home from work.  Try morning sex. If possible sneak at home on a lunch break.  Etc.  "

I'm not sure what that even means, and besides, you don't get to decide if your knowledge is extensive without proving it first.  Definitely rewrite this section.  You should list the software or applications and hardware systems you have experience with.  

Education seems fine, but you need to invert your times, just like in Experience - start with the most recent first.

Experience:  again, invert chronologically with the most recent first.  Second, all you're showing us is the description of the role you had.  Is there any way for you to quantify any of that?

Give him field time by starting him Open Cup games and reserve games. The reserve league exists for growth of players just like him. MacMath probably has well over a decade ahead of him. He's actually *younger* than Andre Blake by almost a full year.

I still don't think Blake was ""too good to pass up"". United certainly passed over him. They wanted Birnbaum from the get go. A couple teams near the top of the draft were looking for goalkeepers and he was a top 5 pick. They simply just wanted to get the pick before Vancouver could and trading the second pick for the first pick was the best option. In my mind, Birnbaum was effectively the top pick, as The Union stipulated that they would not pick him up before DC could.

I don't think Philly necessarily has a plan with this. I think they hope that both players prove their worth and one of them becomes worth something in a trade and one of them becomes the future of Philadelphia soccer. I have to assume they don't really care which one is which."

cluberti,sysadmin,1389905258.0,"Microsoft offers extended support agreements to any premier customer for a cost.  You have to apply for them within a certain timeframe before or after the product goes end-of-life, and to get an extension for support you must provide details on your migration plans off of the EOL'ed product.  At that point, you'll be quoted a cost for a set number of months, and have the ability to pay for such an extension if you agree to the costs and sign a contract.  After that time, if you want to extend the contract extending your support, you'll have to go through the process again, and the costs will increase.  Eventually, Microsoft will stop offering such extensions, but that usually takes a few years.

Your vendor has basically signed an extended support contract, for some amount of money, until November 2014, which means they will be able to continue to receive security updates given to them by Microsoft through their Technical Account Manager each month.

It was a short and cozy read which didn't force me to use my brain too much, which is nice once in a while.

I wouldn't recommend it to many adults, but it seems like a book that would be a great read for children and younger teenagers. I could definitely see myself reading it with any future children I might have.

In any case, with all the hype and fame that it has received it would be a shame not to read it when it only takes a few hours to finish. As long as you come into it expecting a fairy tale you should be fine."

I have one of those pieces of paper that says (i) **I** tolerated school for (for) **four** years straight. It's in leisure studies, I mean software engineering. When I was in school my notebooks had (not) **more** doodles than notes. I wish I had kept them because some of them were pretty hilarious. 

&gt;I have always wanted to live in Japan. I want work in the cutting edge of technology and no one is more cutting edge than Japan. It will probably never **happen** since I'm a picky eater. I've been branching out on my food choices a lot though, so maybe I'd like it.

&gt;I (use) **used** to skateboard all the time but I sold out and got a job. If Netflix (was) **were** food, I'd be morbidly obese. Some days I will binge hardcore. Check out the movie ""Dale and **T**(t)ucker vs. Evil"" on Netflix. Funniest movie I've seen in a long time. 

&gt;My first car I used to call ""the silver bullet"". Top speed was 500mph. It was too fast so I recently bought a safer one it can only go 300mph but whatever. (I've been through some sous find in my life and I've been smoke to use that to build myself into a person i can be proud of.) **I'm not sure what this sentence even means** For some reason most people who meet me like me. I think it's because I'm just so handsome. Take a chance, maybe you will too.

&gt;~~Like I said, I went to college for a bachelors in software engineering.~~ I've been working as a software engineer at a pretty sweet company, but **I'm** currently interviewing for a larger company in Burlington. I'm pretty confident that I'll get the job. My school just started a masters program and I've been thinking about doing that. (I don't want to get too far in debt, so unless my work so last for some of it I'll probably wait;) **Huh?** (I'll) **I** definitely will be doing it at some point though. I'd eventually would like to even get my doctorate in software engineering. I hate school, but I love learning. For now, I'm done **with** school and I'm going to enjoy every second of (it) **life?** until I go back.

 No one here is going to judge you for such a great success story!  You sound really happy and emotionally mature and like you're making great choices.  I have gotten flack on here once or twice for suggesting that a young man (under 25) in a brand new relationship who isn't wanting sex at all might be gay or asexual, but the reality is, there are a ton of men out there who are that closeted.  I have a few gay friends who had girlfriends in college and such while fully knowing they were gay. One of them was actually dumped because of his lack of desire to have sex.

It's a heartbreaking situation to be in.  I had an ex who was bi, and told me about it when we started dating, and I was like ""Cool!"" but as the relationship went on, he became more conservative, claimed he wasn't really bi, he just thought he was into men because he had daddy issues, became actively homophobic, eventually our bedroom died.  I felt repulsive, unwanted, etc for a few years.  

Finally found out he had been having random hookups with guys for years.  

I don't think he's gay - just an asshole who happens to go both ways (he also attempted, but failed, to cheat on me with women). But holy shit did that situation fuck me up.  So I feel you, and if you were nearby I'd buy you a beer."

I didn't really start to think about it more until I met a group of friends who are all feminists, and they became my main friend group. They're mostly female, all self-declared feminists. I didn't really question my Dad's and my brother's interpretation of feminism until I got to know them better; I started to notice that not all the stuff I'd previously taken for granted made sense completely.

First I noticed that there was a huge gap between how my dad portrayed feminism and what it actually was.

Then I started to really listen to what the people on that side of the family were saying and I don't know if I just wasn't paying attention earlier or I just didn't question it, but some of the stuff they say seems really strange and bizarre now. My Dad thinks Hilary Clinton probably has the intelligence to be President but he would never vote for her because she's a woman and he says women are inherently less able to control their emotions. My older sister and brother agree with him. He thinks women are just inherently more emotional and irrational, and over time I started to notice a bunch of things like that at home that were just suddenly very strange to me, and for the first time I admitted to myself that there might just be a huge problem with how my society deals with gender roles and all that.

But I still didn't consider myself a feminist because the way I saw it, that was a problem with society that I couldn't really do anything about. I'm never going to ""fix"" my brother or my dad or my sister; people don't work that way. And I was still reluctant to apply the label of ""feminist"" to myself because I still thought of feminism as a needlessly aggressive viewpoint. I didn't get why I should be concerned, in other words; I figured as long as I made sure I wasn't a jerk to women myself, I was doing all I should do.

Then it got personal.

I have a 9 year old sister. We were playing Super Smash Brothers one day and I picked Samus just on a whim, and my sister said something to the effect of ""Who is he?"", and I said ""She.""

She got this shocked, confused look on her face and said ""Samus is a girl?! How?""

I said ""What do you mean 'How'?""

She said ""I don't know, she does cool things and...""

Now I was interested; I put the controller down and said ""Hold on, why is it strange that Samus is a girl?""

""Well she has cool things and... I don't know.""

I was floored. She's 9 years old. She's barely had any time to assimilate American culture, yet she's completely shocked by the thought of a female character with cool stuff, who can do cool things, who has armor and guns and space things. It isn't that she wasn't aware of the possibility, it's that she *was aware of* a perceived limitation.

I'm not ok with living in a society that teaches my sister that her gender is a limitation on what she can do. That specific moment was when I decided this was a cause worth adopting, and I think I can say I'm a feminist now.


EDIT: I should have clarified that my parents are divorced and my 9 year old sister, not related to my Dad, is actually my half sister who's growing up entirely under the influence of my Mom's side of the family, and that side of my family is VERY different from my Dad's side in this respect. It's very unlikely my sister learned to think that way from interaction with anyone within the household, with the possible exception of my brother."

Pre-campaign, many years ago, Aelar, an elf who lives in a small elven community in the forest (lv 1 ranger) found a young dragonborn child running through the forest. After bringing the child to safety, he made the decision to raise him as his own. After several years, the two decide to leave for a town outside of the forest, so that the dragonborn (Ghesh) can learn to be a (lvl 1) paladin.

Iados is a tiefling enrolled as an apprentice in a local wizard's college. She is bored by the typical, weak magic of wizards and decides to become a warlock in secret, studying magic from forbidden tomes deep within the unseen corners of the library.

Campaign beginning:

The very night Aelar and Ghesh have moved into the town, an explosion is heard. Upon investigation, they find that this was Iados (whom they are only now meeting) practicing a dangerous ritual. The wizards have found out and have kicked her out onto the street. Nowhere to go, she is now homeless. It is then that the bells toll and shouts are heard from the north gate. Kobolds, in greater numbers than any simple clan could ever have, have gathered to lay waste to the city. The watch is quickly overwhelmed, and the townspeople are either vainly attempting to flee or they're locking themselves in their houses. Finding themselves together in an alley after  trying to help guard the gate, they decide they would be better off trying to escape together. They then fight through the city until they eventually escape, and see an ancient black dragon flying above."

wordswench,AskWomen,1389905980.0,"I think the sample bias is not in the research sampling, but in the two groups themselves. There is not a one-to-one relationship between sexual partners so, for example, if you surveyed 10 men and 10 women, all of whom had sex with ONE of the men who happens to use condoms, you'd get a massive difference between the two groups. 

The context of sex is stereotypically somewhat gendered (not sure whether that holds up in reality) and so that could bias those populations quite easily. If this WAS a random variable, IID for men AND women, then the comparison with N=2000 would be very apt, but because it is likely NOT the same distribution between men and women because of gender norms and habits, I feel the 20% disparity is much more reasonable than you are making it out to be."

benk4,nfl,1389906022.0,"&gt; Saying something is ""anything but certain"" would not imply that there's a 50% chance of it occurring. Referring to a 2-pt attempt, you said:
If you get the 2 pointer it was a one score game. If you miss it you still need another score. So half the time it's 1 score, half the time it's 2.
50% chance you say? But then,
Historically 2 point conversions are less than 50% certain.

By anything but certain I mean ""not certain"".  I don't mean ""very unlikely"".  A coinflip is not certain.  

&gt; To go back to my main argument, there's no need to risk putting your team down 2 scores because a 2-pt conversion try is uncertain. 

You have to risk that anyway.  If you don't make the 2 point later you still need an extra scoring drive.  Regardless of when you go for 2, there's a chance that you may need 3 total scores.  Wouldn't you rather know you need that 3rd score with 5 minutes left than with 3 seconds?  

&gt; Teams just don't magically get in scoring range, and asking your team to do it twice with limited time is much more uncertain than converting one 2-pter.

True, but this doesn't take into account the possibility of making the 2 the first time.  In that case you're asking them 2 score once in limited time and have the almost guaranteed extra point.  

You know what's really uncertain though?  Asking your team to score a third time with no time on the clock.  If you go for 2 late you risk that happening."

jeffseadot,ainbow,1389906055.0,"The first GSA I had the option to join was in college, and the group was much more aligned towards activism than support or socializing. I was mostly interested in making friends and finding a boyfriend. Making friends was more important to me, since I had  barely had any friends up to that point, and certainly no gay ones. What few gay people I did know were scattered across the country, since I met them all online. 

So I what I wanted was a social club for queers, and what I got was an activism club. Instead of game nights and pub crawls, we had lengthy discussions about what would be the most inclusive wording for the group's updated constitution (like spending 45 minutes debating ""people"" versus ""persons""). Every now and then they'd have a movie night, but it was always serious movies about gay issues, with discussion time at the end. And this was *after* they decided to make things more lively. 

My first year I more or less forced myself to go to the weekly meetings, even though I never really wanted to. I also made (straight) friends that year, whom I *did* want to spend time with because they were actually fun and interesting. So my attendance dropped dramatically after that first year. 

So to answer your question: no, I don't think it's inappropriate. Different people have different needs and expectations from a group like this, and inclusiveness is kinda their whole point. Catering only to the desires of the ""serious"" members is a good way to drive people away. "

Skellum,paradoxplaza,1389906103.0,"The colonial nations in our History were guided by a mercantilist system where raw products were shipped overseas and finished goods were shipped back at a much lower rate and the trade ensured that europe would benefit to a much greater degree than the colonies. A functioning nation, non-colony, would be interested in shipping finished goods overseas and taking in an equal number of finished and unfinished goods back.  

This is represented by the mono-directional nodes, as in reality Nations wouldnt work well if Europe exported nothing over to them. This can be further shown by say an Exiled Euro nation setting up shop in the former colonies. The Hansa gets exiled would mean it would try to maintain a solid national status instead of forced into a colonial trade situation.

It makes sense that europe would try to pull goods to it, usually unopposed in this, to where it had domination over trade power. A powerful cherokee would try to pull goods to it from europe and other parts, something it cannot due due to the fixed trade nodes."

therealestyeti,AskReddit,1389906495.0,"tattoo artists should have books of their work either online or in their shop. now with the internet it is very easy to see if an artist is good or not. 

the standard procedure will usually involve you booking a time to meet your tattoo artist in person to discuss what you want to get, where you want it, size, colour, etc. then they will draw it and you will meet them again maybe in a week, 2 weeks, etc. tattoo artists, if they're good, have very busy lives because they're giving ink maybe 5 or 6 hours a day, maybe more, and then they're going home to do the sketches for other tattoos at night.

REAL tattoo artists do not like it when you give them a picture and then ask them to put it on your body. that is not art; it's copying. the same goes for text. if they are a true artist in the sense of the word they can go nuts with any idea.

Bullshit.  The reason I want to know the situation is that I want to optimize my strategy.  I want to put the team in the best position to win, and uncertainty around how many scores I need severely hampers that.  Kicking is akin to not keeping track of the score, it's poor situational football.

Also I'm the one making the tough call and opening myself to later questioning.  You're making the easy call so you can deflect blame later and justifying by saying it's what everyone does.

CadHuevFacial,AskWomen,1389906862.0,"I understand why many may feel hesitant to take feminism seriously the way it is typically highlighted, but I think its agenda is oftentimes misinterpreted to mean something understandably disagreeable. 

I hope you don't mind me giving my own interpretation, and that my comment isn't taken as an effort to 'convert' you or anything, I promise it's not. Feminism, to me at least (and it means different things to many different people), rests on the foundation that patriarchy as a social institution, while generally benefiting men and marginalizing women, also affects men negatively and limits their freedoms in a much more subtle but drastic way. At their bases, 'feminine' and 'masculine' qualities/traits are equally normal and essential tenets within a functioning society. Compassion along with stern judgment, assertiveness along with humility, stoicism and sensitivity are all emotional and logical qualities that on their own are difficult to manage, and which are generally attributed to one sex or the other. In a patriarchy, those generally male traits are considered more valuable and powerful on an institutional level, while generally female traits are associated with weakness and, at the extreme, instability. Feminism at its core believes that *both* sets of traits are equally valuable, and that as unfair as it is that women have a tendency to be considered weaker or less-able in our society (regardless of the truth) and that we are expected to behave in a very particular way, it is *equally as unfair* that men, *while still benefiting from this system*, are conditioned to believe that it is unacceptable, inappropriate, and undesirable to show traits associated with femininity. 

I truly believe that patriarchy, the same system that convinces some to believe I am an incompetent driver/leader/breadwinner/logical thinker, an unpredictably emotional person and primarily a sexual object is the same system that prevents many men from comfortably seeking emotionally fulfilling relationships, putting more effort into their appearance (if they want!), pursuing nontraditionally-male occupations, talking about sexual abuse, or asking for help. Patriarchal systems place more value on male traits, and in patriarchal societies where men also happen to be in charge, those traits associated with women are *marginalized* and undervalued not just in women, but men as well. 

I believe things are looking up for women slowly but surely, but I wish they would move up just as quickly for men as well. I don't want to overtake men, and I don't want to 'beat' them or be more successful than them in society. I just want to be considered *equally as valuable* to them in my culture's eyes, but I don't believe I am yet. I don't think it'll necessarily take throes of men suddenly proclaiming themselves to be feminists to change things, but I do think it'll take more male reconsideration of what patriarchy means and how it harms them, too, for men to benefit. 

I don't want to be seen as a dainty, fragile, emotional being who has little capacity for interests outside of what society tells you I'm supposed to like, and I'm sure you want to be seen as more than a tough, impenetrable, sex-obsessed rapist. (Obviously those are extremes.) I imagine most men want to feel more comfortable crying without being told to 'man-up' and 'stop being such a pussy, just get over it', after their dog has died or their girlfriend dumped them because maybe they think something is wrong with them, or they really aren't manly enough when they realize *they aren't just getting over it, and they hurt when they're supposed to be ok and all they want is someone to listen, and understand.* True feminism is trying to make things better for men in this aspect as hard as it is trying to make things better for women. I really do believe everyone can win.

Holy shit, I am so sorry I rambled for so long. I've seen so much of what I think is uninformed sexism on reddit the last couple of days and have felt really disheartened by it, so I think I've just been wanting to get this out and unloaded on your response (lucky you!).

skgoa,formula1,1389906935.0,"A Ferrari mechanic was passed over for a prestigious promotion and decided to get back in contact with an old aquaintance of his, who just happened to be a pretty high-ranking McLaren engineer. The stories about what happened next differ but the two did stay in contact and McLaren learned Ferrari's strategy at a race that McLaren subsequently won due to superiour strategy. Also, the Ferrari mechanic was cought messing with a car's fuel tank before a race and was fired for it.

And then only a little while later the wife of the McLaren engineer went into a copy shop in England with a huge stack of confidential Ferrari documents to have them scanned to CD. The clerk, who was a massive Ferrari fan, promptly wrote an email to Ferrari team principal Stefano Dominicali. Naturally, only a short time after that police burst into the home of the McLaren engineer and found the stolen Ferrari documents. Log files showed that the Ferrari mechanic had printed *something* that consisted of many pages.

So as this scandal starts getting into the press, Ron Dennis tell FIA President Max Mosley that this is as far as it got and that no one else at McLaren saw the documents.

A little while later Lewis Hamilton doesn't listen to team orders and isn't punished by Ron, infuriating the team's #1 driver, then reigning double World Champion Fernando Alonso. So Alonso blocks Hamilton during Quali at the next Grand Prix. Alonso and Dennis have a massive fight, during which Alonso threatens that, should Dennis not support him as #1 driver, Alonso would reveal to the FIA that he had emails in which he and then McLaren development driver Pedro de la Rosa were discussing testing things they knew from the stolen Ferrari documents, thus proving that Dennis had lied to Mosley. We don't know whether Alonso would have gone through with it, because the next thing Dennis does is tell Mosley about the emails. 

A renewed FIA inquiry into McLaren finds that many people at McLaren had seen the documents and that McLaren had used Ferrari data to develop their cars. McLaren is fined $100 million and loses all constructor championship points. Ron Dennis is subsequently ousted as team principal and goes off building his sportscar business. Mercedes decide to jump ship and get their own team at the first opportunity.

PrometheusGXX,HunterXHunter,1389907203.0,"* Of course it may be possible to determine how his ability works but the thing is that Togashi doesn't completely explain everything.  There are a few abilities which don't make sense.  For example, Palm's crystal ball ability is (supposedly) pure enhancement.  I personally believe that the ability just hasn't been explained enough.  I have no idea how one could accomplish what Shoot did. 

* I say that he may be using Specialization abilities because it has been established that Manipulators and Conjurers (being neighboring categories) have the best potential to learn Specialist abilities in the future.  While I do agree that Specialists can break the rules of nen types (like Chrollo, Kurapika, or Leol) that is most often not the case.  In Chrollo or Leol's case they conjure an object which ""records"" the abilities of others allowing them to use other nen users' abilities.  I'm guessing they don't borrow the nen of those they have stolen the abilities from so they are most likely using their own nen.  Now you have to wonder if they are actually performing the ability to the same effectiveness.  I am going to go under the assumption that they are using their own nen for the abilities (because the alternative is silly).  Now, while I understand that they have borrowed the ability I do not think that makes them completely proficient at other nen categories.  I think they are able to perform the abilities so well because they 1) steal the memories of others and 2) use HEAVY restrictions.  I think you should also note that so far no Specialist with a hatsu stealing ability have thus far used anything besides hatsus that primarily use Conjuration, Manipulation, or Specialization (only neighboring categories)(Indoor Fish, Owl's Fun Fun Cloth, Neon's Lovely Ghost Writer, Super Eye, Inamura).  It's just an observation of mine which could just be a coincidence or mean that neither of them can actually use all nen types as proficiently as the nen users they stole their abilities from (with the exception of Lovely Ghost Writer I guess).  This would also serve as another restriction since it greatly decreases the usefulness of the abilities (not saying they aren't useful).  Kurapika's ability is unique and while he can use the other nen categories more effectively he can't use them as well as nen users who actually lie in those category.
&gt;When Kurapika's eyes shift into scarlet, he changes from a Conjurer to a Specialist. This ability allows him to utilize all the types of Nen to 100% efficiency (for a Conjurer).[136] In the manga, Kurapika explains this using the terms ""Level"" and ""Force/Accuracy"": his ""Levels"" in the various Nen categories remain the same during Emperor Time, however, his Force and Accuracy for every category is raised to 100%. Thus, if Kurapika's Level in Conjuration were 10, his Level in Emission (the polar opposite aura type) would be 4, and during Emperor Time, he would be evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter at 100%. Outside of Emperor Time, his Force and Accuracy in Emission would at most be only be 40%. 

In Neferpito's case I think it is safe to assume that she would not perform as well at her opposing categories.  While we don't have evidence I would also make this assumption for the other Specialists in the show like Pokunada.

* I didn't mean to sound like you were saying that nen types should never mix.  By bad.

* I'm not so sure I would say that they are mostly used for secondary abilities.  While nen users can make super effective moves using only their nen type they are essentially limiting the effectiveness of their ability.  Adding other nen types can improve the effectiveness of an already fantastic ability.  It seems to me that most nen users create an ability based on their nen category and then increase the effectiveness and versatility by supplementing other nen types.  But that is just speculation on my part.  Again, I understand you aren't talking about exclusivity when it comes to the abilities.  I mostly agree with you.

* You may be right.  Who knows.  Impossible to tell at this point and it is unlikely that Shoot's abilities will be further explained.  If the manga continues I do suspect we will hear more about Illumi's abilities.

No problem, I enjoy hypothetical discussions like this.  I'm bored right now so I should be thanking you for giving me a bit of entertainment."
Renner1,confession,1389907217.0,"&gt; No, it was a poll someone did. They were either the worst, or second worst, I don't remember. 

Sure, but the people who were responding to the poll may have been third wave feminists, or at least some of them.

The whole red pill concept isn't exactly a well-known one, for one thing.

&gt; People have a right to complain, when someone chooses to film themselves nude.

Or think it strange that there's gratuitous nudity with no seeming purpose apart from ""people are naked sometimes"".

 &gt; At the same time, when they do it in a way that puts down female sexuality

I don't understand how this concept factors in. I don't think it's possible to ""put down"" sexuality through criticizing some manifestation of it (or if it's got nothing to do with sexuality), especially if the manifestation is pointless or stupid.

&gt; or different body types, that's just rude.

It would be rude to say to Denham, ""you're fat and unattractive"" outright to her face, at least in ordinary circumstances.

However, the shit fit she and her idiot producers went on was completely ridiculous, plain and simple. Extremely juvenile.

&gt;  don't remember anyone complaining when Tony Soprano did sex scenes. 

Yeah, but there wasn't any repetitive scenes of Tony Soprano's ballsack flopping around, or anything comparable.

Besides, the point of those scenes were to illustrate the supposed air of power he exudes. An overweight, plain looking man who's able to have sex with a number of attractive women because they're attracted to his aura.

As opposed to ""Tony Soprano probably scratches his nuts"" or whatever.

Additionally, I very much doubt that Gandolfini would start bitching and moaning if someone asked ""why are you having sex on the show all the time"".

 &gt; She has actually made that claim.

It's already been established that she and her producers and her costars are all rather moronic in the worst way. 

You're not some little girl who thinks ""TV equals real life""-- so why let it bother you that the idiotic Denham is trying to say ""the show represents women in America in general""?

&gt; I don't even think her show represents third-wave feminists

She thinks it does, and I see a lot of the stupider aspects of third wave feminism  embedded in her attitude and in the fans of the show. Different aspects, but equally insipid to my way of thinking.

&gt; It's just a weird show, actually. I don't think it represents any aspect of real life.

Apart from the fact that there are women who act like morons or ditzes or make mistakes multiple times, the same as there are men who are just as bad in their own way.

Otherwise, it is a pretty stupid show. Especially when Denham and the rest try to feminist it up to such a level. They look ridiculous and immature.

&gt; That's a good point. The world was beginning to change, but the changes didn't really start to take place until the 1960s.

Sure, the ""sexual revolution"" and the shift in political thought into the 1960's in the states was a part of what I was talking about, I guess. 

Second wave feminists didn't help bring it about, though-- and I was talking more so about the world in general. 
A very tumultuous period.

&gt; I'm not saying that all white males had it good. But if you weren't a white male, your chance of success was pretty low. 

I would disagree. There were certain fields, certain occupations that Caucasian-looking males did have a monopoly on in terms of occupational interest and career paths, but to say that ""only white males were able to excel (in the USA) during the period"" doesn't seem like a given thing. Not really the case, historically, anyways.

&gt; Actually, it was, despite what some Northerners try to claim. Segregation was the law in the South, but it was practiced to almost the same degree in the North. Lynchings occurred in the North, interracial marriage was illegal in some states in the North, and Black Americans were treated poorly in almost all parts of the country. 

&gt; Even today, I have actually noticed a higher degree of racism in the North. 

Sure, things like that are never so cut and paste, or are at least more complicated then what is often talked about at the basic level.

What I was getting at is essentially that the situation for blacks in the country did vary drastically depending on where they lived.

&gt; Generally, yes. When you have one gender holding all the political power, that is oppression. 

 I suppose it could branch into that in extreme cases, but I don't think that one of the central tenets of a ""patriarchal"" society, in the historical sense, was to keep women down on a conscious level. Some women and some men would be lower or seen as underclasses, certainly-- depending on where you're talking about and what a specific society was like.

&gt; What necessity was there to form a patriarchal society?

I think, for the most part, survival, as the dynamics of the world changed.

When people started to build more permanent communities around farming or agriculture, it became necessary for the larger, stronger individuals to take on certain roles; usually involving the completion of the more strenuous labour in terms of defence, as soldiers. 

9 times out of 10, especially in situations that are less then ideal for physical health and development, these will be males.

""Mexicans are lazy"" - Racist. 

""Jamaicans should work the farms and stay away from our women"" - Racist

wordswench,AskWomen,1389907353.0,"Umm, what? Gender norms cause male and female sexual patterns to be skewed towards DIFFERENT behaviors across the board, so yes they can be skewed across large samples of one gender. 

Case in point: what if 80% of the men are having sex with 60% of the women and all are using condoms? You said:

&gt; logically impossible for (straight) men to have a different average number of partners than (straight) women

But that's actually false. In America, where we have a roughly even gender split (50/50 effectively) men have more lifetime sexual partners than women by about half (7 vs 4). This is exactly because of what you're saying is impossible - people having sex in uneven numbers because of multiple people having sex with the same person.  

Fundamentally it comes down to this:

&gt; For every man having sex (or using a condom), there must be one woman doing the same thing.

True, but there are a few things off about that statement, even though it is right: that woman doesn't have to be *uniquely* that man's sexual partner, or vice versa. 

That many may go off and have sex with someone else - now there are two sexual events, both of which involved condoms, but which only involved 3 unique partners, 1 male and 2 female. 

That's how, even though you say this is a logical fallacy, the things you say (like different numbers of lifetime sexual partners across genders) are true.

If you don't, then having kids is not for you.

Having a child will not:

1. Guarantee you companionship when you are old. Nursing homes are full of people who have multiple kids...that never come to visit them.

2. Guarantee that you will feel fulfilled as a human being. If you are not enough for yourself without children, you will not be enough for yourself without them.

3. Guarantee you any sort of legacy. In two generations, your genes will be so diluted as to not matter whether you had children or not. How many of your great great grandparents do you know about at all, let alone in detail? 

Additionally, the world is bursting at the seams with humans. Climate change is happening NOW, not in some distant future. It is a very real probability that the next generation is going to be in deep shit regarding food, water and natural disasters. THE NEXT GENERATION.

I absolutely agree.  But possession isn't really a factor because it's equal both ways.  If you make the 2 pointer, you need two total possessions.  If you miss the 2 pointer you need 3 total possessions.  This is independent of when the 2 pointer is attempted.  

So if you kick, then go for it and miss, you still need 3 total possessions.  The same number you need if you missed earlier. 

This is where time comes into play.  If you go for it earlier you now know much earlier in the game that you need 3 total scores to tie.  This gives you time to adjust your strategy.  If you wait until later to go for it you could find out that you need that 3rd possession with pretty much no time left.  "

I wouldn't mind a good LTR, but I would be an absolute fool to dismiss other guaranteed sexual partners for the chance of sex with one person.

Keep in mind that I will completely dismiss any and all self reported accounts of her own purity. So, while she may actually have a low partner count I simply won't believe her because I've had enough experience to know that good girls do jump on the occasional alpha for no other reason than strong tingles.

You don't have to take my word for it, rampant PED use has been discussed a lot, feel free to do your own research about it.

We can prove that those murders happened. We don't know about the PED usage for sure though, so in reality it's all speculation.

DukeCanada,AskMen,1389907939.0,"Ugh, well ok. That's a funny take on it I suppose. If that's what you're into then who am I to judge.

The answer is the same though. Essentially what you're going to have to do is approach the guy like a man might approach a woman. Women tend to be more quiet/reserved/shy at the start of the dating game. It's not intrinsic to women, but it does seem to be the roll they're taught to play, and the guy has to be the aggressor. You're playing the guy's role. 

1 - You're going to have to muster up the courage to do the approach. You said you're fine with this, so that's good. 

2 - Find something to comment on. Their hat, their shirt, their jacket. Perhaps whatever he was talking about. 

3 - Carry out the conversation. Keep a strong frame and don't be outcome dependent. Make your intentions known. If this person is truly shy its you that's going to have to give your number out and tell him to text you. Actually, it's probably better if you get his number and text him first.

Keep in mind that most guys are not use to being approach by women and will act like a deer caught in headlights for a moment or two. Just give him a second and he'll revert to normal. This may be especially true for a shy person, so...perhaps a few more moments.

I hope this helps. /r/seduction is good for this sort of thing and will work in your context, despite being a woman. They're pretty good about respecting the women on that subreddit to. "

After all of the ridiculous fighting and smoking in places that you're not supposed to smoke at, I decided to break off and roll solo for a while. I saw that Star Tours had basically no wait so I walked in. I had got used to power walking everywhere when I was there so I was moving at a pretty brisk speed but I guess that wasn't fast enough because a couple people wearing those shirts sprinted ahead of me. I shook my head and decided to step to the right so I wouldn't get passed by anymore people. Little did I know, that I must have cut their group into two because when we got up to the cast member I felt a pointed finger in my back. As I turned to see what was poking me, a middle aged woman shoves me to the side and runs forward to meet up with her group. Now, I can forgive someone accidentally bumping into me or stepping on my foot no problem but this was blatant.

One would have to agree on the counting method, since each card has multiple lines of text. Do you still count left-to-right, spanning the cards to form a line? Do you count the words in the first card before moving to the next?

I'd expect maybe 4 sets of numbers - Page:Row:Column:Word (or Letter) to point out a specific card in the grid and then narrow it down to the word or letter they want us to use.

It still has a derogatory context to it. ""Africans are black"" is not racist, but by some definitions of racism it is. I haven't made a definition, I'm just using the commonly accepted one. 

Again, how one reacts to a statement doesn't make it a racist statement. It's the statement itself which must be racist or not. It's not subjective, it's objective. Just because the majority of women here find it offensive doesn't mean it's racist. Why? Because it can be an offensive statement without being racist. Someone could clearly be offended by someone calling them ""passive"", when they don't think they are. Does it make the person who said it racist? No, it just means they made a poor observation and corresponding statement. 

As for the dismissive-ness (I don't think this is a word btw, but you had me fooled aha) argument, not particularly. I'm actually from a minority, I understand racism from a personal perspective. Not every offensive statement regarding a race is racist. What if this statement was ""Asians are cuter than Western women, and I find that attractive"". The exact same sentiment is there, but one word is changed. Is it racist? No, most certainly not. It's this persons opinion being vocalized. Still, Western women may be offended. "

Not sure why you need this, but you can't get it without having the paths in the first place.  Besides, now you need every system to start maintaining information concerning the state of the entire network.  this won't scale at all.

&gt; Individual devices along the way would be able to update the next/previous node with quicker paths if they existed,

The next and previous nodes may go away.  It sounds like you're talking about something like BGP, which doesn't update like this very frequently, mostly because it only scales so well.

&gt; if a route becomes invalid then it just 'falls off' the top 10 list of fastest routes and is replaced (as opposed to a new route needing to be calculated).

Now you're back to large number of devices having to know a lot about large parts of the network.  This doesn't scale well.

This may work for a handful of devices, but it doesn't work well at all for large scale networks, especially when nodes are appearing and dropping off the network constantly."

I just checked the tarte shade and the description is ""Medium-Tan Honey - medium to tan skin with peach undertone"" so if that was a good match you might have peach undertones. If that was the case, you might stick with tarte and sample these shades since these are the lighter options than Medium-Tan Honey with peach undertones:

Goddamn, almost nothing in the game makes me rage more than this. I absolutely hate it when people state that we ""need"" something that isn't even really a role. Sure, maybe you want to make sure that your team doesn't consist of Enchantress, Pugna, Ancient Apparition, Leshrac and Lina, but often there's not really a good reason to pick up a durable hero if they don't have good synergy with your team. In fact, simply buying items that give you more health is often much more effective in exchange for a better hero lineup.

Oh, and I also hate it when pubs insist that we need a hard carry every game. Yes, it's not wise to play without any hero that can do well with farm, but you don't always need an Alchemist/Antimage/Medusa/Phantom Lancer on your team.

nixy19,AskWomen,1389909372.0,"Yesss. I have come to realize I am very attracted to somewhat feminine bisexual guys, androgynous guys and girls, and fem girls who, like me, kind of act ""bro-like"" (I do not know how else to describe that). For a long time I wondered, ""What does that mean?"" but now I just do not think about it too much at all. I mean, I have pretty much always known I was not straight and I now see no reason to really get any deeper into my attraction/preference. 

I definitely cannot say I ""learned/was taught"" to be into anything really. There are things that I recently discovered I really liked, but not really for any specific reason other than I had never really explored it before, so I did not know. Now that I have, my lady bits have been pretty clear in informing me of my attraction.

Now that I think about it though, I guess I can say my childhood did condition me in a way, and to a point. I grew up not really feeling loved or pretty. As I got older I realized two things:

1) I was attracted to more than just ""guys""

2) I just wanted to feel attractive, loved, and accepted by someone I loved

Not feeling wanted most of the time, I guess I welcome anyone that can make me feel that way. However, being born with an attraction to people all across the gender/sex spectrum has allowed me to be physically attracted to any/all of them. (I think that makes sense.)

I guess the only other thing I do wonder about is my want to be dominant. I never really felt that way until after I was raped. That was 9 years ago this May. I think it is just about wanting to feel in control after experiencing something that was not in my control. I do not *need* to be dominant, but when I have sexual fantasies in my head, I am always doing whatever I want to whoever I want. They are somewhat submissive, but I am by no means forcing anything."

I don't think many people realize how well Ashe can actually do, and how much effort and time needed to do decently with her at all. Yes, she is quite simplistic in her kit and is therefore easy to pick up, but there's a stark contrast one can have between just playing her and actually being a threat. Hopefully, you can get there in a short amount of time :)

-----------

Navigating the map... I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this. Is this referring to how you should be moving during mid-late game, how do you play during laning phase vs. different bot lanes, something like that?

Kiting as an ADC really does take some good mechanical skill. I finally have it, but note that I don't play extensively anymore and it's been 2 years, so the time it takes for you is obviously variable. The ideal way to kite is to be constantly doing DPS damage while not being touched, regardless if you're chasing or being chased. Lot easier said than done. There are plenty of YT accounts with videos on kiting specifically that I could direct you to, if you would like the help.

Quick thing about W: If you can get multiple CS from one usage, do it. If you can do that AND hit an enemy laner, even better. Early levels, you definitely want to be aware of how much you use W. Since the mana cost on the skill is flat regardless of ability rank, you can afford to use it more during mid-late game, when you'll have it maxed out first anyway.

------------

Building Ashe will be something like this:

Start: 

* Doran's Blade
* HP Pot
* Yellow Trink


Necessary Items:

* Berserker's Greaves
* Infinity Edge
* Last Whisper
* Phantom Dancer OR Statikk Shiv
* Bloodthirster
* Guardian's Angel/Randuin's Omen/Mercurial Scimitar/Banshee's Veil

The boots upgrade is standard on all ADCs. Not much here other than that you could potentially switch this for Boots of Swift. (for slow resist) or Merc. Treads (for the tenacity).

IE is core and should never be skipped on Ashe. The crit passive on the item synergizes so well with Ashe, it's honestly kind of ridiculous and fun.

LW is for countering the guaranteed armor items that will appear on the enemy team. I've started to emphasize grabbing LW over the AS items (PD/SS) because how much you still do in mid-game.

Between PD and SS, the comparison is this: PD is better for increased DPS on single targets and kiting due to its passive ignoring unit collision. SS is better for a bit more burst and waveclear. If you need the item but can't afford PD, go for SS. When possible, it's always advisable to sell SS and pick up PD because the damage is simply higher on it.

BT is to give you a great item for auto-attacking as well a great source for lifesteal. Just overall a better option than getting BotRK on Ashe specifically, IMO.

Your defensive item (which I recommend getting as your 4th/5th item) depends on the other team:
* GA for survivability all-around, Omen for AD-heavy comps, Banshee's for the spell shield against some initiation ability, Scimitar for the AD and for cleansing hard CC with the active.

The devil's advocate argument for upgrading, of course, is that support has existed for the product for 13 years, and Windows 7 has been available since 2009.  There are some really valid reasons to stay on XP (most of them application compatibility, especially with control of industrial systems), and any organization can choose to simply disconnect XP machines from the network, or take a risk and continue to run things as-is without patching.  However, Microsoft is 3 major versions and 13 years past, so it's not really fiscally reasonable to continue to make the world safe for XP users, when that effort and those resources are better spent on supported products.  There are organizations who already do this sort of thing, installing only service packs, etc., so this would likely be an easier prospect to manage due to experience than the org that is used to keeping things up to date.

Edgar_Allan_Rich,seduction,1389910298.0,I agree. I'll even take it much further and say that this whole practice is laughably closed-minded and idealistic. I picture these list-makers as perpetual match.com customers.
sexandliquor,Cartalk,1389910299.0,This is something you really need to check with local laws about. Is there not a Connecticut subreddit? 
f3tch,ArcherFX,1389910310.0,It isn't *that* hard to put on a spoiler tag though. Although I haven't been on this sub for 3 days because I couldn't watch the show.
scooper1030,nba,1389910310.0,"Where did you see those numbers? That sounds strange to me, but at the same time their reasoning could be that Len's foul could be seen as somewhat unintentional or accidental, whereas Morris' only intention was to fight when he went after Young. "
Hypo_kazoos,engineering,1389910310.0,"As an engineering student, I am also interested in this."
tonguesplitter,IAmA,1389910311.0,The guy in his tighty whiteys at the beginning.
Skellum,paradoxplaza,1389910311.0,"I agree that the triangle trade in the mid Caribbean was a bit broken. I mean the ability to trade Rum, Sugar, And slaves all in a closed loop with very little going out really was unfair. But historical, and the correction of this closed loop would be other traders pulling the trade out of this system via ships. 

This does of course leave the question of what to do with 100% land routes, probably the best would to be sure that this cannot happen is to not allow the user to put Merchants at odds with each others movement. "
pitachitah,AskReddit,1389910312.0,I remember being at a party with him where he pooped in the corner in full view of everyone else and blamed it on his dog.
aliceness,funny,1389910336.0,"I once followed the arrows/drive-direction lines in a multi-storey carpark, not realising I could just take a shortcut and go up the ramps at one end."
Toaster95,teenagers,1389910338.0,"Dayum, look at the back of her head. She's a dime piece"
KennyFuckingPowers,community,1389910339.0,"I'm friendzoned so I helped her move. 3 days prior, I had a shirt made for the occasion referencing my favorite TV show. She had never seen it, so she didn't understand."
Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389910351.0,"Ooh, yum!"
Neebat,WTF,1389910355.0,"And really, really long wires."
Maldevinine,booksuggestions,1389910362.0,"We had this come up in /r/fantasy a few months ago. OP for that thread helpfully collated all the suggestions.

Brandonsfl,GrandTheftAutoV,1389910366.0,Cops dont kill you at one star

Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389910373.0,"Can't beat carbs, it's true."
user_naem,unitedkingdom,1389910377.0,I did something similar for ten months last year. The tricky bit is finding somewhere to do it. I lucked out and know a couple who were going on a round the world cruise including six months in New Zealand visiting family. They needed someone to water the plants and feed the cat; I somehow segued an offer to do that into an offer to live there for £1 rent + bills. Saved me a fortune but goddamn their cat needed a lot of attention
KennyFuckingPowers,hiphopheads,1389910378.0,YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS BOSS YOU DON'T HAVE THE EDUCATION
laa916,movies,1389910385.0,He wasn't the mandarin. Why is that so hard to understand? 
Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389910389.0,Cream cheese or some other kind?
cptn_garlock,anime,1389910403.0,"Well...okay. Am I the only one who feels like they wasted a fuck-ton of time in this episode? So many little scenes that were irrelevant, and yet we still barely got any reaction on Banri w.r.t Yana dating Linda. 

Also, guess all that talk about Ghost Banri fucking everything up for Banri was a one-episode thing? A totally *useless* one episode thing? I mean, you risk your credibility by introducing the single supernatural element and then making it an active component, and then *don't use it after just one episode?* Takemiya sensei, this is beneath you. "
3DGrunge,gaming,1389910405.0,That's because terrible medics just sprint around reviving people instead of making sure there is not a guy with an lmg or dmr staring at him.
Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389910430.0,And if you enjoy making them that can be a comfort in and of itself.
sexandliquor,Cartalk,1389910434.0,"It's a Hyudani don't buy a Hyundai. They're horribly made cars. Barring the last few years apparently, they've always been notoriously shitty.

**edit**- do you know the service history of it? timing belt/chain replaced?"
bluesky747,WTF,1389910438.0,His hand looks like a cat now. 
nixy19,AskWomen,1389910439.0,"I am like this with guys, but not women (usually). Thing is, I never *know* the guys are emotionally damaged until *after* I have already determined I am attracted. Then I am attracted to them needing me to nurture them I guess. Is it odd that I do not generally feel the same thing for women?"
Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389910451.0,What makes them Outback?

cycophuk,IndieGaming,1389910461.0,I was bummed the game didn't get voted for the Community Choice.  I would have liked to get it.

beckymegan,letsplay,1389910468.0,"Well I never share files, just this one time. And since I was mailing it to him, I didn't bother compressing it."
mecaenas,politics,1389910469.0,But that requires regulations.. What are you? A Maoist!?
I_am_chris_dorner,todayilearned,1389910485.0,Has anyone else noticed all the pro-India propaganda that gets posted all over reddit every time there's a big rape story in the news?
BillygotTalent,nba,1389910491.0,Might be because they aren't fans of either the Hawks or Nets and because the tube knows no traffic jams.
3DGrunge,gaming,1389910494.0,Sounds like a glitch.   I shall report this and any insta reviving I see.
Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389910500.0,Can't argue with that. =)
JonLuca,iOSthemes,1389910518.0,"iFile is shareware, which means most of the app is free - go ahead and get it!"
jpla86,AskMen,1389910544.0,"Lip piercings, tongue piercings and nose piercings. When I see someone with those piercings I say to myself, ""that must've hurt."""
winter83,GrandTheftAutoV,1389910553.0,I know I kept looking for it everywhere but I could never find it. 
Mygarik,Morrowind,1389910559.0,"Short answer: make Morrowind.

Long answer: edit or create landmasses, npcs, items, world objects, dialogue trees, questlines and so on. Well, wholesale creation of items and world objects gets iffy without a modeling program, but still.

Basically, the Construction Set can be used to modify nearly every aspect of the game world."

Steel_Pump_Gorilla,MMA,1389910589.0,"No, it's not the *only* instance, I'm saying that it's an instance that would be more likely to raise concern. And the type of PEDs that the UFC and the NSAC would have been concerned about would be more likely to come up during this match, no?"
redyellowand,againstmensrights,1389910595.0,"Okay guys actual question:  um, why did they start using ""equity""? I don't know if I've ever run across that term in a feminist context and I don't really see why it would be such a bad thing? Like why are they all like ""oooooooh EQUITY IS SO BAD""?"
Lirkmor,AskReddit,1389910602.0,I can't think of anything but sashimi... What's the winky face for?
