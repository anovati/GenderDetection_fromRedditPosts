racistsfuckoff,explainlikeimfive,1389814114.0,"&gt; People are greedy and selfish. They cannot accept the fact that people should be equal.

Is this true? Or is it just your opinion on humanity? And how much of greed and selfishness is inherent? How much is the result of the environment we're in rather than being biologically predetermined?

I think the failure of the revolution in Russia had a lot more to do with the economic and political sabotage carried out by the governments of capitalist countries than it did with some inherent inability of the Russian people to accept equality, and the bloating of the bureaucracy of unrepresentative and corrupt leaders had more to do with this pressure from outside Russia than it did the ""human nature"" of those few individuals. 

Capitalism most always be expanding and growing, and *always* encroaches upon new territory. We can see this after a war, for example, with capital within a war-effected area is smashed up, and outside capitalists expand into the newly available area. One lone communist country, especially one like Russia at the time which could not produce everything necessary for survival within it's own borders, could not possibly survive as an island in the sea of world capitalism. We saw the quickness of capitalist countries to invade, to economically and ideologically sabotage, to 'break in' to Russia, and we saw the need of Russia to compromise to this in order to survive. For communism to succeed, it doesn't need to be confined to a small village, it needs the opposite. It must be world-wide.  "

Aqua (Water/Eau), Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Silica, Cyclohexasiloxane, Dimethicone, PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract, Litchi Chinensis Pericarp Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tribehenin, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Dimethicone/PEG-10/15 Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Polyglycerin-3 Crosspolymer, Isopropyl Titanium Triisostearate, Polysorbate 20, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Propylene Glycol, Carbomer, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hexyl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol.

So you can see that water is the first ingredient, but since various silicones are also some of the first ingredients the foundation will likely function most like a silicone-based foundation.

Fourth: I firmly believe that the biggest reason Kaep was so explosive last year, was because we still had Smith on the sidelines. Everybody was astonished that he's not playing like he was last year. But if Kaep goes down now, yay we still have Colt McCoy? Nah that's not gonna cut it either."

ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1389814464.0,"&gt; Makeover TV shows such as 10 Years Younger or What Not to Wear also rely on the trope of dramatic and instantaneous change. Admittedly, these demonstrate more of the transformative processes, but still implying that all will be perfect once they are completed, making outer appearance and inner peace synonymous. What happened to their subjects once the cameras go away?

Maybe I'll be able to parse why better later, but this really resounded with me. The illusion might be present in media but it's certainly also present *in us.* We want to believe we can erase our dissatisfaction by solely changing our external selves.

This isn't limited to the transgender community and I think eclipses it - it is the basis of a huge economy in plastic surgery, fashion, makeup, personal trainers, magazines...

It gets to the heart of body image in the media. The transgender experience really reveals to me that it is a falsehood, but I'm not sure how I feel about that, or what it means. It's something we all live with - this sense that we should conform externally to some image and that out internal selves follow. Do we *actually* live that way? Or do we revert ourselves to who we really are, given any length of time? Or do we all have terribly secret internal selves, disconnected from the lives we lead? Transgender people have terrible secret selves, too, but they air them out, at least a little, when they undergo transition. Is that maybe why it is so difficult for them to find acceptance in the same way gays have?"

kornberg,consulting,1389814575.0,"Specific advice meaning that you ask someone you work for and have a good relationship with to give you some pointers on what you should do specifically to work towards getting a job on your career path at that firm. If you're not sure what you want to do, then ask if they could sit down with you and have a conversation about your future career prospects and then he can put you in touch with people you would need to talk to. 

So let's say you don't really know what you want and you and your mentor (now known as Mr. Anderson) chat for a bit and you think that you could be interested in working in finance consulting, actuarial consulting and human capital consulting. Then Mr. Anderson (after insisting that his name is Neo) introduces you to Mr. Smith in finance, Ms. Weber in actuary and Mr. Jones in HC. You chat with these people, get a better idea of what they do day-to-day and ask for advice on how to make yourself an ideal candidate for their group. Every organization is different and what works for one may not work in another. Mr. Jones may be super impressed by extra curricular work at your company while I don't really care about that at my (hypothetical) company. Ms. Weber's manager may want to see really awesome class projects and Mr. Smith's boss may just want to hire his buddies. 

I suggest that you check out multiple areas of interest because you're young and you need to experience what you're getting yourself into before you commit. I ended up with a degree in psychology (and I started at 26!) and if I had done some research into the industry early in my education instead of later on (also I did my degree in 2.5 years) I would have ended up with a degree that is more applicable to my current career track.

K2TheM,forza,1389814674.0,"Forza 5 is fantastic, but a bit... clipped. While the driving and atmosphere are better than ever, the car/ track count was reduced. For some, this is a game breaker, for others it's not. Personally the car/track list that is in the game is OK; only sorely lacking in some upper end race cars (a handful of LMP cars, no DTM, no GT500) and some classic/longer courses (no Suzuka, no Nurburgring, no Fujimi, etc). Is it worth buying an Xbox One over? Probably not. Is it worth getting if you have an Xbox One? Yes. Also, while it may be a sore spot for some people, Drivatars are a great improvement over the AI of prior titles.

Of the prior Forza titles, 4 is the best. It has a strong compliment of cars and tracks, as well as a decent physics model. It also has a lot to do between a flowing career mode, online rivals, and straight up multiplayer; plus a Car Club system. Downside is the apex braking, race line following, wooden AI.

I've never used a racing wheel since the OG Gran Turismo, so I can't help there. 

As for improving your technique: Most real world methods apply. The easiest way to improve in game (IMO) is to pick a car, and go race rivals. This will allow you to always be following a faster opponent and be able to watch and learn how they are taking corners."

That's the basic premise, but the offshoots of it make for some good conspiracy theories.  My birther family members also think the illuminati is involved and that Obama has a secret hit squad that killed Breitbart (a conservative blogger)."

Merely *reading* such material isn't called out by name in the elder's manual. What is called out is ""Deliberately spreading teachings contrary to Bible truth as taught by Jehovah's Witnesses"". So you probably would not be disfellowshipped just for reading criticism (how would they know?)

Some, or most perhaps, of what we would call ""criticism"" however, they would call ""apostasy"". And apostasy is their kryptonite. If they knew about it, what would likely happen is that you'd get taken into the back room with some elders and ""counseled"" about it. 

If you persisted, and they knew about it, that would mean that your doubts and actions were at least somewhat public and ongoing, and there is where the potential for more action to be taken lies. If they saw fit, they might form up a Judicial Committee to determine how far this obsession with apostate material goes — they'd interrogate the person reading the critical material, looking for evidence that would justify disfellowshipping.

What you want to check out is the book *Shepherding the Flock of God*, which is available as a PDF if you google it. It's the ""secret"" elders' manual of the JW's, which of course no regular JW is supposed to see or read."

*Full disclosure: I guess I'm a little to blame for setting BroBible's David Covucci and his hapless broworkers on their respective downward spirals of sexual depravity; one night in December, I was perusing the ADULT section of Fab.com (as a lady is wont to do), I found these disposable blow job sleeves that looked a little like what kids on the playground used to (politically incorrectly) refer to as ""Chinese handcuffs."" And I tweeted about them, jokingly, as a fun last minute gift idea. Inspired by a new world of possibility to which I'd apparently introduced him, Covucci contacted the company, which happily provided him with a wide array of fuck sleeves at no cost.* 

*Normally, the Dudes Putting Their Dicks In Things genre isn't my first choice for reading material, but Covucci's honest, self deprecating, and slightly graphic tale of doing it with various plastic tubes (and convincing all of his coworkers at BroBible to take home plastic) is surprisingly engaging, although one of the diagrams in particular — for an implement called the ""Flip Hole"" that retails for $110 — and one of the product names in particular — ""Hole lotion""— really brought out my wretch reflex.

jongbag,changemyview,1389815391.0,"I think there is a fundamental attitude here that is assumed by most staunch supporters of free market capitalism and, in general, most large corporations. That attitude is that businesses exist for one purpose- to make money. 

I realize that for many people, this is such a basic assumption about the way business should work that it warrants zero contemplation. But I challenge that view. I think it's harmful to individuals, I think it's harmful to communities, and I think it's harmful to the environment. 

Obviously, making a profit is a necessary aim of running a business. But why does it have to be the sole aim, or even the primary aim? There have been plenty of businesses who were concerned with bettering their community, or providing a quality product or service to people in way that they could take pride in. My parent's generation was full of companies like that; making things that were built to last, not to fail.

My point is, I think there are other business models besides that of maximizing profits. There are plenty of existing companies that have concerns that go far beyond just making a bunch of money.

He often fights his own party on things he believes in and will actually veto legislation that he doesn't agree with.

Imagine, a Republican Governor actually doing their job! It could be why Michigan is still suffering pretty badly, but has a $96 million surplus in their budget.

Snyder is still trying to get the Billion dollars needed just to return our road infrastructure to an acceptable level. But because he has fought the establishment, he will never get it.

I really value the committment in my relationship, but this kind of thinking baffles me.  If one partner is desperately unhappy with a major aspect of the relationship and the other partner is unwilling or unable to improve, then what?  

If the answer is: I would rather be unhappy with this aspect of my relationship until the day I die than break up, then that's cool.  That's totally your prerogative and recognizing that as a potential outcome may bring you peace and make you less unhappy about it.

But real change requires real risk. A lot of people come in here saying ""I just can't go on like this!  But breaking up isn't on the table!""  You can't have it both ways.  Either you will learn to accept things going on like this, or breaking up has to be a viable option.  Because you can't force someone to change.  

This doesn't mean things can't improve, but StoneNL's point that the ""what then"" is a question everyone in an unhappy situation that they want to change should be able to answer."

can it be considered fraud if she takes the semen out of the condom against your will (or without asking you) and inseminates herself with it? I mean, you used the condom specifically so she doesn't get inseminated, right?

education is always a plus.

ulvok_coven,TrueReddit,1389816268.0,"I disagree with him on a basic, presumptive level. He's trying to reconstruct these ideologies from principle as if they make sense. They don't. Rightist religious parties in other nations are often very conscious of social welfare. Right parties in every country aren't trying to dismantle socialize health care, nor protections for the poor and elderly.

The parties are the way they are for appropriately capitalist reasons - they have no principles, they're mostly interested in winning. Left-center-populism in politics ruled for nearly fifty years - Roosevelt to Carter. Reagan riles up a base of those who felt disenfranchised by the left, which is still the Republican base today - rural and reactionist. Clinton was business-friendly as any Democrat had ever been and was known for attacking Bush for *raising taxes* when he had promised not to. Obama represents the more educated and moderate people who were pushed out hard by Dubya's rhetoric.

The principles and platforms of these parties have everything to do with the voters they're trying to attract than anything else. This is why the Republican party was once liberal, almost radical, and the Democrats were very conservative; the Democrats lost their base after Lincoln, and the Republicans lost theirs after FDR. Since then they've been tugging each at urban and rural populations, who really don't have dissimilar interests on a national level, but can be bought by nominal appeasement of their pet causes."

He took it as a compliment. At one point, someone came in with zip ties and tied him, me and another person up together(a guy I started to talk to at other parties). We were starting to walk up stairs(ithink, my memory is kinda blurry from that scene), so I yanked out of it. And then we all started talking and stuff.

I completed the Village quests and am confident in Multiplayer, but still have a long way to go before I'm near the skill of some of these players. 



Overall, have patience, watch the monsters and learn their moves. Like PapaCornJr was saying, the sense of progression in this game is extremely rewarding. If you can get over the initial hump of learning the mechanics, combos, and mannerisms of yours and the monster's actions, this game will turn into the best game you've ever played. At least that's how it happened for me.

girlaboutoaktown,polyamory,1389816714.0,"I agree this is the ideal approach, but in reality I've seen it work out much differently in many cases. 

Being open means the potential for NRE, which can be really destructive and irrational in how it makes otherwise great people act.  It can lead to impulsive and bad decisions which can cause a lot of harm to an existing relationship, particularly if the original partner already has a lot of insecurity or jealousy.

The fact is, if a couple is closed, the chances of experince NRE with another person still exists (via cheating, crushes, flirtation, etc) but you're not actively seeking it out as people tend to in a poly situation (most new relationships go through some degree of NRE, after all).  

I think it's realistic to say that Polyamory or even just being open does increase the chance of an original relationship ending.  It's adding another factor that can be very damaging if one partner is behaving selfishly or not responding to their original partner's needs, or the original partner is behaving badly due to not being able to handle their insecurity.   Which are things that may have not happened if the relationship wasn't open.

Yes, mono relationships are fraught and can end at any time, but in poly you are specifically adding a big unstable element that can make that more likely.  I think it's wise to acknowledge that instead of glossing over it."

Ask anyone who knows me and they'll know I love my Smashbox. I'm also a fan of nudes, MLBB, and berries.

It's super long lasting with proper pre-buffing of the lips. I'm also super dry and this lipstick is moisturizing and doesn't cause me to feel even more dehydrated like most do. The pricing is really great compared to most other mid-brands and the color is AWESOME. It's so pigmented and lush. My sister has been coming into my room secretly and taking it (along with my favorite blush) so I've actually been forced to hide it. &gt;__&gt;

There are many other ways to keep the fun going that do not rely on an erection.  You have a tongue and fingers, use them!  Truthfully, I wouldn't even be past kissing a neck or oral 5 minutes into sex.

I'm just gonna be honest, if you've busted a nut 5 minutes in, you're doing sex *wrong*.  Develop your mental pre-game.  Touch her body, make sure to touch all of it.  Kiss it, smell it, tell her what she makes you want to do.  Tease her, pretend that you are starting, but then stop.  Make her want it.

TL;DR: Sex should have a warm-up period. Don't fucking kick the door down, vomit on yourself and pass out on the floor."

* Thüringer Rostbratwurst  
* Nürnberger Rostbratwurst  
* Weißwurst (only try it south of the Main (pronounced ""mine"") river)

The first two are grilled over a charcoal fire, else they aren't what they could be. Best served with a fine-ground stingy mustard. The Weißwurst is boiled and served with medium-ground sweet mustard.

* Bockwurst is similar to a wiener but thicker (no double-entendre intended), I like it more when it's warmed, but many people also like it cold.
* Landjäger is a hearty sausage that was pressed into a rectangular shape. It's a classic as proviant for hiking.  
* Mett technically isn't a sausage. It's ground pork seasoned with salt, pepper and onions. It's eaten raw on bread rolls. And it's delicious. (There are special laws in place to regulate the hygenic aspect. It's illegal to sell Mett that was ground more than 24 hours ago. (There are some exceptions in place for Mett packaged in a sterile environment.))

And right or wrong, most people now believe that those who are severely overweight or obese are not good reps for the company as a whole. Which is also where a lot of people stop realizing that a business exists to make money, not to cater to you. So when the chips are down they are going to pick an employee most likely to bring in or keep current business. Which means playing to peoples prejudices.

The issue with security-related updates is that they generally update multiple binaries at a time and doing all of the ""does this apply?"" logic can take a LONG time.  When done online, this logic is done before the package is downloaded/installed by the WU agent, which is much quicker than having the binaries already staged on the box, and then having the updates installer have to do it.

Charge gives you a LARGE forward speed boost that you ~~can't~~ can turn off and recharges fairly quickly.

You have to adjust the esc for this because you are changing where the neutral point is.

The three modes on the ESC do affect power. Setting 1 is normal. Setting 2 is there because some race legues don't allow reverse. Setting 3 is the one that reduces power for new users or young users.

Neither party is always right or always wrong and if your media station of choice seems to be forgetting that fact then they're biased. Also, Fox news isn't just biased but they present 'facts' that are completely fabricated. I'm sure other news agencies do this as well, but Fox is the worst offender.  

* The bipartisan system in the US is broken. If the Democrats propose a good idea then Republicans immediately oppose it, even if they may agree with it, to make sure they stay in favor with their voters. Same thing applies if Republicans propose a good idea. It cuts both ways and it's absurd.  

* Finally and most importantly, the US doesn't need to act as the world's police force. The US has become a laughing stock amongst the citizens of almost every other country in the world because we are so far behind the rest of the civilized nations. We have become that guy that is 6'7"", weighs 350 pounds and is made of solid muscle, but has nothing in his head but sawdust. Yes, we have the ability to flatten any nation militaristically and because of that people have to listen to our opinions, but no one respects us anymore. We have to get our heads out of our asses, stop forcing our policies down everyone's throats and get our government into the 21st century."

I do not have a movement unless you call equality a movement unlike you man hating woman denouncing feminist movement you love so much.

&gt;I get that there's injustice in the world, but your buddy who's wife wanted children so bad she tricked him; is that why they divorced? How is that fair to her, didn't she have the right to have children with her husband? I'm not saying what she did was right, so don't assume that, but there's a fairness issue. If he didn't want kids bad enough to have to be tricked. He should have gotten a vasectomy and been done with it.

Yes a man must mutilate his body and be subservient.  No they already had one child.  They got a divorce due to her cheating on him while he was overseas.

&gt;Now for women and sexualized views of them. Men did that. Would you want your daughters to dress like that? I don't, but we like seeing girls in bikinis showing off that new car. Sex sells and it sells well enough that it's becoming cultural and people sell themselves in a way to fit in by emulating what they see on TV.

Yes men are the only ones to blame.  Just evil men they control everything and women are incapable of doing anything. I forgot how pathetic you think women are.  They are just so inferior compared to men.

&gt;The Men's Rights Movement has the worst image out there because anyone not in the movement, don't see men as losing rights and asking for more is like asking for a White History month. I don't care about your movement because frankly, I think is selfish and desperate. You may have true fears with real validity, but it's like following National Socialism: you may have your reasons, but the leaders have other motives.

The mens rights movement has nothing to do with anything other than equality.  However I am not part of any movements.  I think you are an idiot and should not have a right to open your mouth in public due to the ignorance and stupidity you spout.  However I believe in free speech.  You however did describe the feminist moment with your idiocy fairly well.

&gt;You would do better to push for equality under a human rights banner. Asking for more rights for men, in a society that gives more to men, is just going to cheapen your real and true quest for equality

Until nicotine is no longer a ""regulated"" drug there is nothing we can do about this. Big P and Big T come in at this point. They encourage the continued regulation of Nicotine and Nicotine products.

I hate to say it, but just because e-cigs are a new product in the grand scheme of things. It does not mean that the individual ingredients or components weren't regulated before hand. Thinking that just because parts of an e-cig are regulated does not mean that the e-cig creation made them become regulated.

ruat_caelum,learnprogramming,1389817592.0,"My first suggestion is always to map it out on paper or in your head (PAPER IS BETTER)

For instance for checkers we need what items before we even start the game?

We need two colors of checkers right? with a set of 12 a piece. How do we hold that in data? each checker needs to be tracked independently right? But what else? we need to know if the checkers are normal or ""king-ed"" right? So that means we need 24 unique IDs with 24 boolean varibles.

Since a ChAR or BYTE holds the values 0-255, if we use the least sig significant bit to mean king or not we are left with 0-127 unique ids. That is more than enough for us.

Wait a minute... do the pieces need to be unique? is a normal red checker any different than any other normal red checker? Nope. That means we only need to know if the square holds a red or black and if it is a king or not.

* The above mistake is much harder to change when you have half the program coded but very easy to fix while sketching out on paper.

I would build a board (a double array, or nested array) In it it would hold a CHAR or INT. 0 is red normal, 1 is black normal, 2 is red king, 3 is black king, and 4 is empty space.

then you only need to manipulate the board as per the rules. This is done in steps as well.

* Check to see if the move is valid, i.e. pieces exist, are of the color being allowed to move, can end up where they want to move them, and if a piece is deleted (i.e. jumped.)

* Then check for win conditions (i.e. only one color left on the board.)

* Then other players turn, etc."

Dr_Destructo28,againstmensrights,1389817727.0,"Yes, public mental health care and a destigmatization of mental illness can do wonders.  Also, while addiction is certainly a mental health problem, it almost requires a category of its own.  We as a society LOOOOOVE to shit on people with addictions.  We love to think that because we don't have a substance abuse problem, we are somehow morally superior or have better will power than addicts.  This is not the case.  Addiction is often a problem of the brain's pleasure and reward system.  A lot of shelters have a zero tolerance policy for drugs, and while I certainly understand the reasons for not wanting to have people shooting up heroin in government housing, it pretty much means that a person has to kick their addiction before they are even allowed into a long term facility.

Housing first programs are, thankfully, being embraced and recognized as a better way to help homeless people.  Rather than kicking a person out of a halfway home when they test positive, they are put into their own apartment from the start, and they stay there regardless of their addiction status.  Having a roof over their head makes it much more likely that they can recover in the long run (even if they fall off the wagon a few times), and there is a much reduced rate of hospitalization and incarcerations among the people who have used this program.

The idea that our society likes to force people to live on the street if they can't stay sober is just really maddening.  Okay, rant over.

Some degree of it can't be avoided - it just goes with the territory. What matters is who you tell what.  I have sussed out which friends are non-gossipy and I can share personal stuff with.  For example, I've told 4 people I'm in an open marriage, and as far as I can tell, none of that information has gotten out, because I only told people I knew well and really trust and told them specifically NOT to share that information.  However, I mentioned casually to more people that my husband and I are trying to get pregnant - within a few days, people were running up to me to talk about it.  That gave me a good idea of who is a gossip and who isn't.  

The great thing is, the only people who have to know about your personal life are people you should trust - those you are in serious relationships with.  So giving people strict instructions NOT to share your comings and goings with others is one way to help this.

But there's gonna be some amount of bleed through no matter what, I think."

Miss_anthropyy,actuallesbians,1389817804.0,"Wait until you graduate. 

I'm 25 and have my BA after 6 years of school. I'm still in grad school and plan on getting my PhD (another 5-10 yrs of school). The man (I'm bi) I thought I was going to marry in undergrad is no longer a part of my life. So, so, so much of my life has changed since graduation.  It's nothing like you think it will be.  Living together with others is NOTHING like living with someone on your own. In college you have a lot less responsibilities (yes, even in higher level degrees). So much is in flux and you don't know where you're going to end up. I now work full time and my life is very different than my friends in full-time doctorate programs. I am settled and will be in one place for a while. They have to travel wherever the winds of academia may take them.  Wound up breaking up with my boyfriend (not the same ex as before) in the fall because we just weren't in the same place - I'm settled until I start my doctorate and he doesn't know where he is from month to month getting his doctorate (he's ABD now). 

If you know you will be together there is no reason to propose, either.  Long engagement or not. You are still very young and have a lot of living still to do. I don't agree with people marrying at my age (where I live is a wealthy high-education area so people marry older than they do, say, in the south - I'm in the US).  Marriage and engagement means having your life together and planning, and that's not something you can do as a student. It's just not. 

Be responsible and wait. You're letting your emotions get the better of you and marriage isn't an emotions thing. If engagement won't change anything either way, then wait until you're more settled. You'll be glad you did. 


I didn't want to hear that as a student either, but you don't realize how much school shields you from until you're out. "

I try hard to engage men as respectfully as I can in feminist musings when I find the timing relevant, and while it may at the time be more *convenient* for me to simply list my personal oppressions or reasons for identifying as a feminist, I've found the most *effective* way to begin that conversation is by highlighting the relationship between patriarchy and, say, typical male hesitance and discomfort in showing vulnerability. I know not everyone needs to see that connection to reject patriarchy or adopt a feminist ethic, but I think it helps in bridging respectful dialogue between the active and the uninformed.

I understand why many women and men still have a hard time with calling themselves feminists outright when much of the populace wrongly insists that to be a feminist is to hate men. Thanks again for sharing."

EmergencyTaco,AskReddit,1389818235.0,"One night when I was eleven or so my mother was in a drunken rage and she was screaming at my seven year old brother, and my brother was screaming at her. I usually just locked myself in my room during these ordeals but tonight was different. I got in-between them and told them to both shut up and listen to me. Mom didn't like that, but for whatever reason she stopped yelling. I told her that she was being belligerent and needed to go lie down, (I didn't even know I knew that word, it just felt right at the time), and I told my brother to go to his room and go to sleep as it was past his bed time. I don't know why, but they both listened to me. I then went to my room and called my dad, (he was, is and always will be an amazing father, but my parents were divorced and they had joint custody so I spent half my time with my mother), and I burst into tears, told him what happened and asked what I was supposed to do. He said something I'll never forget: ""Mikey, you're very smart and I'm very proud of you. I'm going to speak to you like an adult, and I'm going to ask you to do something that I should have never had to. I want you to watch out for your brother and make sure you keep things between him and your mother in check. I want you to be his parent while you're over there if you don't think mom can handle it, okay?"" From that day until we were finally removed from her custody when I was 15 I acted as the adult in the house and diffused dozens of fights between my mother and my brother, and even between my mother and myself although those were much less common. Those four years matured me way faster than I should have at that age, and it made associating with kids my age quite difficult, but my brother and I made it through the situation alright. I'm 20 now and in university, and I'm finally only responsible for myself. My brother is living with my dad, and although he has some issues my dad is dealing with them excellently. This may not seem like much to you guys, but that night is when I really feel like my childhood started to end. I'm only 20 so that's the only significant event in my life that fits this question."

If your husband is interested, there was a great book that delved into actual scientific data about female desire.  It's called ""What Do Women Want?

Whippets, AKA nitrous oxide, AKA gas anesthetics. Often times whippets are ""done"" by filling a balloon with nitrous oxide from a small cartridge or a tank, and inhaling. Although they give that giddy feeling you can experience at the dentist's office, whippets may also lead to loss of consciousness, mouth and throat injury, and long-term nerve damage. You've heard people say that whippets ""kill brain cells."" Well, they do deprive your brain of oxygen (the same thing that happens when you are strangled) and this can cause brain damage and even death.

My issue is that those kind of companies-as you said- are the exception to the norm.

A big part of this equation is the consumer. To have these kinds of businesses on a larger scale requires more consumers to be informed and conscious of what they're purchasing. There is increasing momentum for this way of thinking, which makes me happy.

As far as some of the large corporations are concerned, however, there are *plenty* of companies that already make exorbitant profit margins, and yet continue to decrease the quality or the manufacturing of their product even more so they can further their profits even more.

In short, greed. 

We can talk all we want about a company's need to make money, but when a company has met that goal in excess, why is it taken for granted that their goods and processes should decline at the expense of the consumer, all so they can exponentially increase their profits? "

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389819021.0,"It makes perfect sense.  Like I said, if you value the relationship to the point where you're willing to accept that your sexual partnership may never reach the level you want it to, that's great: because it's a great realization to have.  ANd like I said, I think clarifying that for yourself can make things better, because it can help with frustration and resentment.

I think the transgender analogy is a fine one.  I actually have friends who have been through that exact thing - more than one.  (I come from the SF bay area and run in queer circles, so it's not that unusual really).  I'm actually at the opposite point and I've talked about this: I'd be willing to try to stay with my husband if he realized he was really a woman and wanted to transition to female (no chance of this happening, but it's an interesting thought exercise).  But if he had no interest in having sex with me, that would be the end of our romantic relationship, although hopefully we'd still be friends. Everyone has different dealbreakers.

Luckily you're not at that point: your husband says he wants sex and 1-3 times a month, and him being responsive to you initiating is a much better situation than 90% of the people here, after all.  I think it's normal for couples to go through periods of sexual disconnect at times, but as long as both partners are willing to work at it, I think that spark can be revived to some degree provided they're both willing.  

I just think it's important to clarify what's a dealbreaker and what's not in any relationship.  This board does jump to ""break up with them!"" way too quickly, in my opinion, because a lot of people here are understandably bitter.  But I personally see nothing in your situation that says things are unfixable or hopeless, just frustrating - for both of you, I imagine.

Those are good prices for what you're getting. I have the same 40"" bar pictured, but got it from another source under a different name for more money. My only complaint is the quality of the little aluminum stands and that they bolt together with the actual light casing receiving the bolt and it is pretty easy to strip out the threads in the aluminum case. I switched out the little stands and haven't had any trouble with stripping yet, but a know a couple people that have. Once you strip it, it's junk.

I also have some Rigid lights. They are very good quality, but they have been known to fog inside the lens. Rigid is very good about repairs though.

The best lights I have ever used, absolutely bar-none, are Whelens. I have two Micro Pioneers mounted at the A-pillar and they are every bit as bright as my 40"" bar like the Exploration Outfitters lights you're looking at.

I've read an article (can't find at the moment) that compared 3 different S&amp;P500 index trackers and found that higher MER fees resulted in better tracking. However, if the whole index crashed, it doesn't matter how well you tracked it, you would still lose because your strategy failed... which brings me back to strategy vs implementation.

Banks are able to implement more complicated strategies, which gives them more choices, but not necessarily better choices (e.g. [Hedge funds do worse than S&amp;P500 on average](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-07/hedge-funds-rise-7-4-in-year-to-trail-s-p-500.html)). I think of the example of the [iterative prisoner's dilemma tournament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#Strategy_for_the_iterated_prisoners.27_dilemma) where everyone submits strategies on how to behave in a game with set rules. The winning strategy was ""tit-for-tat"", which was also one of the simplest strategies.

In any case, there doesn't exist a best strategy because the market conditions keep on changing (e.g. Rock is no longer the best because everyone has switched to rock.. or paper).

My understanding of how big players make money is that as ""[market makers](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp)"", they also receive fees (whereas we pay fees to trade) and get special abilities, like being able to set bid/ask quotes.

**tl;dr** Having more manpower/speed improves implementation of more complicated strategies that aren't necessarily better."

sexandliquor,Cartalk,1389819849.0,"Transmission tech here.

There's two things. For one there's a difference between a transmission flush and a simple transmission service aka drain &amp; fill.

**Transmission flush**-- Hooking up a flusher machine to the transmission and pushing ATF through it at rapid speeds. Flushes are controversial in the automotive world for a couple reasons. 1) Generally when this is performed the filter isn't changed and 2) Often times flushes just push around contaminants inside the transmission and letting it settle elsewhere, to cause problems that originally the transmission didn't have.

**Transmission service**-- Draining the fluid, removing the transmission pan, replacing the filter (if applicable), putting a new pan gasket on, putting the pan back on and putting new fluid in the transmission.

I differentiate these two things because they are very different.

To answer your question, why do they do more harm than good on an older car with high miles? It's complicated, but the basic thing is this-- transmissions should be serviced all throughout their life to give the transmission longevity. A transmission should be serviced every 30-50k miles depending on the model of transmission.

Most people wait until the transmission has well over 100k miles before they think about servicing it. In that case it's better to just leave the transmission alone. Transmissions can be very sensitive units. They rely on hydraulic pressure to function correctly. As automatic transmission fluid breaks down over time the transmission gets used to it's known conditions and hydraulic pressures. Entering new fluid into a system that already has well worn fluid causes changes in hydraulic pressure in the transmission. The seals, clutches, pistons, and hydraulic channels all react differently.

Many people experience transmission problems where there were none after performing a transmission service or flush on a high mileage unit. At the point there's nothing that can be done, as there is no way to get all the new fluid out.

The other thing is, if you wait until the car has high mileage and you perform a flush or service and the transmission starts having problems, the transmission was going to fail soon anyway.

Many people also use transmission flushes or services as a problem solver, when it's not. It's preventative maintenance, nothing more. IF you have a transmission issue already, flushing it or servicing it is not going to bring it back."

""Is anyone out there? I've become separated, over."" Sandor picked up the radio from the dead soldier's hip.

""Who is this?"" he asked. ""This is supposed to be a secure channel. Over."" He frowned, peering into the dark jungle around him. It was a moonless night, and up above, in the breaks in the thick canopy, the stars were radiant and glowing in the midnight sky.

""Lieutenant Milner, sir. 3rd Platoon, 22nd Company. We were ambushed on the ridge, I need immediate evacuation, over."" Sandor nodded slowly. He'd heard the massive fire fight from down in the valley, seen the brilliant flashes of machine guns and mortar explosions.

""Listen, Lieutenant,"" Sandor replied, ""the valley is secure, and the attack has been repelled. You may be the only one of your troops still alive."" He stepped toward the sound of engines. In the distance, miles away and through the spaces in the overgrown jungle, he could barely make out the landing boats on the shore as they beat a hasty retreat. ""If you come down to where I am, I'll accept your surrender. Over.""

There was a long pause, almost too long, then, ""Alright. Where are you, over?"" Sandor considered the question. If this Lt. Milner was caught by others, he'd probably be shot; even if they accepted his surrender, it meant Sandor wasn't going to earn a bounty. A Lieutenant these days was worth a small fortune.

""Fire a shot into the air. Over,"" Sandor suggested.

""No way! They'll find me before I get off this hill, over.""

""Just one shot, then move downhill toward the valley. It's harder to find someone if they just shoot once. Over."" Sandor was lying, of course, but it was the best option he had at this point.

CRACK

The shot had clearly come from the west, on Bygrum's Hill, but it wasn't sharp enough to fix on. The jungle had deadened the report of the rifle. But Sandor had an idea. The radio was a squad-issued set, meaning that only a handful of soldiers had units and access to this particular channel. He turned back to the trench of soldiers, all killed by Chlorine gas instantly, delivered by the naval bombardment. The soldier who he'd taken the radio from was a Sergeant in A Squadron, Tiger Brigade. From his rough estimate, most, if not all, of Tiger Brigade was lying dead here at his feet. There was probably a dead scout up in the hills, then, missing the other radio.

""Okay,"" Sandor replied, ""start walking down the east face of the hill, you'll see a spring and a waterfall on your way down; follow the river until you get to a certain rock that you can't miss. Radio when you arrive there. Out."" That would be about twenty minutes. He was reluctant to give specific directions, not wanting to deliver Lt. Milner up on a silver platter. Sandor had no idea how many radios A Squadron had, nor if someone else was listening.

The battle had been brutal since the first ships appeared on the horizon a week ago. Six days of continuous shelling had taken a toll on the defenders, then the sudden gas attack that morning. It was a new, unexpected turn in the war, a horror both sides had promised to forego. But the war dragged on, and horrors became daily routine. This island wasn't thought of as being very strategically-located, but apparently the enemy had drawn up new plans.

Sandor found the Commanding Officer's personal tent and decided to take a rest. It'd been a long time since he could sit and do nothing. He put his feet up on the desk and started flipping through the papers: Troop Deployments for Island 115, Nutritional Survey of Tiger Division, Enemy Strategies, Units Identified by Naval Spotters, Development Plans for Island 115. Etcetera.

""I'm here, over.""

""What does the rock look like? Over."" Sandor asked.

""It's... it looks like it was painted pink, over."" That was the one. Sandor-- and anyone else listening-- knew it by heart. It was the impromptu mascot of the Division, painted after a particularly rowdy night of drinking and celebrating. Sandor couldn't even remember what the celebration was for, now.

""Turn south, stick to the river, and watch out. There's infantry in that part of the jungle looking for enemy troops. Over.""

""No, I don't think there is, over."" Sandor looked at the radio, bemused, as if it could explain itself.

""Say again. Over.""

""I think that this area is clear. I didn't hear a single person on the way here. Lots of dead soldiers, though, over."" Sandor set the radio down, picturing the last few days in his head. The island was small and insignificant; the only strategic resource here was a refuelling depot at South Shore Station, perhaps 10 million barrels of gasoline reserves. The depot wasn't even intended for large ships, only medium-range patrol ships who stopped here to top off as they patrolled the straits.

The disturbing thing, thought Sandor, was that the shelling had been... unusual. It had started at each end of the island, east and west, and gradually moved to the centre. Clearly the enemy had been herding the defenders toward the valley in the middle of the island; but why? There was a fortified shelter here, and--

The gas. It had to be the Chlorine gas. Get everyone concentrated in one spot, then kill them in one shot. Sandor had been lucky, he recalled, having hidden out and waited for the shelling to pass him by. He hadn't been in the valley until just about two hours ago. If the whole brigade had been here, there couldn't have been more than two, maybe three dozen survivors on the island at most.

""You know,"" Lt. Milner interrupted Sandor's thoughts, ""I picked up this radio thinking it was my own. I guess our radios look very similar, over."" Sandor brushed aside his thoughts, clearing his mind.

""I suppose. Where are you now? Over.""

""I'm at the foot of the hill, at the tree line. The river is 50 meters to my right, over.""

""Okay, after about a mile, you're going to come up to the trench line on the perimeter. On the other side of the trench line is a minefield. Look for a trench that has coconuts in it; those mark the safe paths through the mines. When you're standing by the trench, you'll see a tree about 150 yards away that's painted with phosphorescent-blue striping. You can't miss it. Walk a straight line; you'll have about 20 yards on each side that are safe. Over."" There was a long pause.

""Alright. I'm just going to have to trust you, I guess. Out.""

Sandor picked up a file that had caught his eye: the one marked ""Units Identified by Naval Spotters"". Sandor had respect for these cowboys. Their job was to pilot an inflatable boat as close to the enemy ships as they dared, and for no reason other than to spot identifying markers, patches, flags, emblems; whatever the enemy was flying. Curious, he began flipping through. The cowboys had identified naval units almost exclusively; the only exception was Lt. Milner's unit: 3rd Platoon, 22nd Company - ABCD Rangefinder. He didn't know what ABCD meant, but he knew that a Rangefinder was a soldier who observed enemy movements and sent in coordinates to maximize artillery fire. Normally, Sandor had respect for these guys as well: the ones who hid out behind enemy lines for weeks at a time. Lt. Milner must have been calling in fire the whole week. But the ABCD part bothered him; usually he could rattle off the enemy's acronyms instantly.

He set the file aside and booted up the CO's laptop. Using his own passcode, Sandor accessed the intelligence files, hoping that his low clearance level would prove helpful. And sure enough, he found the list he needed. He scrolled through quickly, finding ABCD in the Clearance Level 2 sections.

Artillery-Based Chemical Dispersal.

Chemical. Lt. Milner had been calling in the gas attacks, not the artillery fire. There was honor in artillery, but none in the cowardly gas. Sandor threw the laptop against the desk and walked back out to the trenches. There before him laid hundreds of his fellow rebels. They had fought and died for their freedom. Sandor picked up his rifle and walked toward the safe lane in the minefield. Too bad, he thought. The bounty for a Lieutenant would have been a stroke of luck."

When used outside of the appropriate contexts it makes me and other women feel as if we are ""other"" - more like we are objects to the men who refer to us as such. Like we are another species. Maybe ""male"" doesn't bother you, but because we are so objectified on a regular basis, when I'm referred to as ""a female"" it feels like we are being examined not seen as another human being by the person using the term.

He had spent the day drinking at our local Applebees, and after several beers and one of their finely cooked meals he realized he needed to take a shit.  So he gets up from his bar stool and makes his way to the bathroom, realizing about halfway there that he should have been sitting on the toilet about 2 minutes prior so he books it.  Well he doesn't make it there completely and he ends up shitting his pants before he can sit down.  After he finishes up on the toilet he grabs some paper towel and gets down on his hands and knees scrubbing his underwear on the bathroom floor (he was drunk keep in mind).  Well as he's doing this the bathroom door opens and a well known gay man (this is a smaller town) walks in as my friend's brother is on all fours, ass facing the door.  The gay just stops and stares with his jaw to the floor then turned on his heels and left.  I tear up laughing every time I think of this story."

* The physical force of storm tides can destroy systems.
* The power is intermittent, which means you have to store it, and that gets expensive fast.
* Wildlife needs to be protected and systems need to be protected from wildlife.  Apparently sharks *hate* magnetic fields and try to destroy them.  (? This seems bizarre to me.)

She was apparently super sweet and loving to the rest of the family, but I never saw that side of her. She held a grudge against my mother for being difficult to control. Grandma didn't like to be disagreed with, or have her authority disrespected. When my mother announced she was leaving Catholicism, and then married a man who'd lost his faith as well, Grandma was furious. Mom eventually stopped caring what she thought, and kept living her life. When Grandma saw that she could no longer hurt my Mom, she decided to take out her frustrations on her grandchildren - my siblings and I. My sisters and I remember getting called all sorts of names. The last thing I ever remember Grandma saying to me was that I looked like ""a hussy.""

ADHD is primarily an impulse disorder.  If I'm horny and then I have the impulse, I want it RIGHT THEN - otherwise I need to feel desired and warmed up to get really into it, but it's not that hard for me because sex is a highly stimulating activity.

Your husband is sexually responsive to you, so it just makes me wonder if he might have issues with attention/distraction.  Based on your first post, which I missed before.

The sadder alternative is that he's lazy.  But ADHD symptoms can make us appear lazy when we're really not!  They can also make us seem clueless, inconsiderate, blind to obvious signals, etc.

Even Mary Wollstonecraft (18th century) is considered a feminist (see the wikipedia page I just linked), so you're arguing against a wall.



&gt;Your other link said nothing about feminism blaming men so I don't see why you thought it was relevant.

If calling men in general oppressors and patriarchal women insane does not count as putting the sole blame on men, nothing does. Please explain how that is not blaming men.

- a modern feminist rejects the ""blaming men"" part of the old feminists I quoted or

I had a second degree tear which I honestly barely noticed, and dislocated my tailbone which was AWFUL to recover from. I couldn't sit upright for over 2 months. Labor was not too bad up until the last 3 hours or so... That part was so painful. I can't even explain it in words.

My daughter was born healthy, and is doing great at 3.5 months. However I don't know what I want to do for baby #2. I might say just drug me up... Or I might go to a birth center. I'm very undecided. I will not go natural in a hospital again though. "

Maybe you shopped there in a different time but the last time I shopped there the clothes seemed just.. poorly made? I've had a lot of their clothes rip or fray after only a couple months of use. I just personally see it as a brand for tweens but maybe where I live is different. Also, I almost *never* buy ANYTHING full price.

If it's the latter, great. If it's the former, make sure your entire group wants to do that. You can also do a good role-playing based game in GURPS. Just enforce the players away from combat based skills and towards utility skills. Then encourage and reward the players for thinking up non-combat solutions to the problems that face them."

I've spent a lot of time with burners and they tend to lead very interesting lives. They truly just think differently than the average Joe; working to live rather than living to work despite being very conscientious and responsible people. Not all of them are burnouts and most (if not all) I've met have been really great. An event like burning man is like Christmas vacation for them, so they spend the year building up to it and ""keeping the fire stoked"" by participating in wacky hippie shit on the weekends. It's really quite awesome to get invited in as an outsider.

Generally speaking though, anyone who only talks about one thing is just a fucking idiot. That girl is an idiot and there is no rule stating you have to be smart to go to Burning Man.

I also quite enjoyed Clash of Heroes: Might and Magic. It's basically Heroes of Might and Magic (with a more cartoony art style) with a match3 fighting mechanics, except that there are some tweaks to it. Matching soldiers of the same type and color gives them a countdown before they attack an enemy and you have to work quite a bit with positioning and managing those countdowns. The game also has explicit puzzles within where you are presented with a specific situation and have to resolve it with a limited number of moves. =&gt; just check out the demo on steam, it should give you a good impression on whether you'd like it. It can fully be played with a controller and is on consoles and even DS as well. 

I'd also recommend Thomas Was Alone. Nice story, good feel to it. There are a handfull of bits that are platformery but the vast majority of situations are solved conceptually more so than it being about execution. "

The preference doesn't just come out of nowhere though.  It comes from beliefs, largely influenced by culture.  We have a weird culture that is both sex negative and sexually obsessed.  As a result, Westerners in general but Americans in particular are skitzophrenic about sex.  We want hot sex!  With love too hopefully!  But we don't want our partner to want sex as much as we want sex, but we want them to want only us!  It's insane.

Nowhere am I rooting for the other side.  This situation is pure shit for every side and sucks for everyone involved.

&gt;The whole problem here is the inability for police to detect realistic danger. Is he fighting back? Is he using force? Does he have a weapon?

No he is not fighting back however he is resisting orders and resisting arrest.  Are cops supposed to just let everyone go that refuses to be arrested or follow their orders while being arrested?  In the film is does look like he is fighting back granted fighting to get free but fighting none the less.  He is clearly wrestling with them.  Do we know if he was biting at all?  Not from the video.

he is screaming yes however at no point does he stop fighting the officers.  The entire time he is wrestling and trying to free himself and get away.  I do not use audio often and without audio it really looks like he is fighting them the entire time.  Were the police excessive yes.  But it was not grievously excessive.  They simply did not have the training to deal with the situation and that is a failure of the department.  Were they trying to kill him no.

techlos,schizophrenia,1389822078.0,"I grow my own. I thankfully have some friends who mailed me some Charlotte's web seeds, which is a strain specifically bred for high CBD content. I selected clones from the seeds, and kept the one that gave me the most benefit, and least side-effects. (i'm assuming that would be the highest in CBD) I don't take it by itself, because isolating it from cannabis is hard work, and i enjoy smoking weed. I'm using by myself, as it's illegal in australia - however, i informed my doctor, and he's keeping tabs on me.

As for the effects, it's very different from recreational strains. There's a sense of the indica couch-lock, but in general i just feel more relaxed, and my back pain lessens - although i think that's down to the small thc content. Compared to a traditional antipsychotic, it's much better - it doesn't knock me out, i've lost weight since switching over, and i just feel happier in general. There's none of the emotional blunting effect, if anything it enhances life a little. If anything, it's easier to fall asleep with high-cbd weed - I just have a large spliff before bed. But it's also easier to wake up, and rather than feel groggy in the morning i feel refreshed and energetic.

As for symptoms, the voices have stopped entirely, along with paranoia and delusions. I still get occasional visual hallucinations, however rather than being shadow people and spiders, they tend to be abstract patterns. It's much easier to ignore, because they're obviously hallucinations. One thing i've noticed, is that instead of voices, i'll occasionally hear abstract musi

Edit: Just as a disclaimer, this is very experimental, and YMMV. I don't recommend other people trying it until more research comes out, but considering how bad typical and atypical antipsychotics are for me (little effect on symptoms other than delusions and paranoia, sleeping all day, and getting fat), i'm willing to try any alternative treatment."

eetsumkaus,malefashion,1389822176.0,"Punk draws a lot of its aesthetics from post-WWII America, which is heavily military inspired (biker jackets and the like) because of its association with the beginnings of rock and roll. The proximity and intellectual heritage between the punk movement and the mod movement would also cause some aesthetics to bleed over I believe. Enter pieces like the M-65 and M-51, which were heavily used by mods and skinheads, and which are probably abundant and cheap given the large military surpluses at the time of punk's rise, and you can see how the two aesthetics basically evolved to work with each other.

UlgraTheTerrible,TrollXChromosomes,1389822645.0,"Thing is, I find it striking that you use the word ""romantically"" in your title... 

The word ""romance"" initially meant ""fanciful falsehood"" or ""lie""... 

And that's what it is, really. I'm not saying romance is always a bad thing, but that it often masquerades as love... Because really, you at least *don't* love your benefriend just yet. You're enjoying the idea. Which is fine, but that's what's up. That's infatuation. 

Love is never stupid. Love is... Well. A lot of people don't know what it really is, and overuse the word. 

While I'm not religious in the slightest, the best description I've ever found of what love *really* is was in Corinthians: 

&gt; 1 Corinthians 13:4-13 (New International Version)
&gt; 
&gt; 4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
&gt; 
&gt; 8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
&gt; 
&gt; 13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.

By that definition, I have been in roughly 20 relationships, but I have been in love with someone all of twice, and only once has anyone been in love with me back. 

It's really a lofty goal. Truth be told, there are a lot of people out there who never find that, even those who are married... And it's very sad. But give yourself some time. You'll get there. But for now, enjoy your cheese and your cats and know that love is one of those things that tends to show up when you truly stop looking, which sucks, but is also completely true.  "

Cerberus150,AskReddit,1389822726.0,"&gt;You realize humankind's entire concept of morality and ethics comes from religion? 

No.  No it doesn't.

As social animals, most people have a natural instinct to bond with others.  This is because the formation of social groups is an excellent way to ensure survival and prosperity.  Religious standards were derived from these existing and basic human instincts.  

This is because of the fact that when people get along and don't engage in anti-social behavior, (murder, rape, thievery, etc.) they are more able to prosper as a group.  Religion did play a part in the creation of laws derived from these instincts, but it is not by any means the original source of morality.

kornberg,consulting,1389822728.0,"You do not owe your employer anything, at least on the scale of staying in a role that is not a good fit out of a sense of obligation to them. Your job is no longer a good fit for you. They want someone who wants to be there and you want to want to be at your job. It's not working out any more for you and that's totally ok. They know that this has been an issue for you and I am sure that they will not be surprised when you hand in your resignation. If they are as awesome and supportive as you say, then they will be sad to lose you but genuinely happy for you to move on in your career. They will deal with the project staffing, don't worry about it. 

Your instinct to wait until you've got an offer is a good one--it's usually not a good idea to tell your boss you're moving before you know anything solid. When you get the written offer and it's signed, sealed and delivered, sit down with your boss and verbally give your resignation along with a written resignation. Send another written resignation to HR. Give at least 2 weeks notice, more if you can. Say what you've said here--you've enjoyed your time at the company, you've learned a lot but they don't have the opportunities you want for your career and there is more travel than your real life can handle, so you've made the difficult decision to accept employment elsewhere. 

Before you go in, decide whether or not you'd stay if they offered you something comparable to the job you've accepted. They may or may not try to counter-offer to get you to stay and you should be prepared for that. I like to tell people to think of the minimum of what it would take to get you to stay and not to stay unless those requirements are met or exceeded. So for you, you could decide that you'll stay if they give you 20K more, no more travel and 100% development work without having to relocate. If they can't give you that, then you graciously decline and move on with your new career. Like the other poster said, don't dick around with negotiations. If they ask what it'll take, tell them and accept if they offer that. If they don't offer that and it's not up to your bottom line, just say that you appreciate the offer but you cannot accept it. They'll get it. By not dicking around, you've kept this bridge and your professional relationship intact and that could be a good thing later. 

Good luck!

girlaboutoaktown,DeadBedrooms,1389822953.0,"I'm actually agreeing with you on this versus 60565.  A ton of people on this sub aren't willing to leave, and that's fine.  It is a place for venting and commiseration.  I think that can get frustrating for the advice-givers who are ""fixers"" who see the ""obvious"" solution to the problem. 

Not being willing to leave doesn't mean you aren't in pain or that you don't have a problem.  I find it frustrating when people say they can't live like this but also aren't willing to leave.  If someone can say ""I can live like this but I'm going to do everything I can not to,"" that makes sense to me.

That said, I do agree with 60565 that assuming your husband has a relatively normal libido and isn't asexual or extremely LL, some of the ways he's acting are inconsiderate (at best!) which doesn't make him a bad guy, but it does mean that he's not trying as hard as he could/should be.  Everyone falls short of perfect or being their best, so again, this doesn't mean it's a reason to break up, but I do think it can be reason to break out the big guns in terms of the ""Do you really value this relationship?"" speech.  But that's harder to do if you have no leverage, and the only leverage people have in a relationship is leaving, sadly.  

It's a tough spot to be in because you have no leverage other than hoping your partner will really understand how sad this makes you."

Mandreotti,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1389823164.0,"Pros:  
-Blind. HUGE CC detriment for the enemy marksman.  
-On-hit damage. Single trades will come out in your favor early game. You would excel greatly with a lot of on-hit items and attack speed, making his itemization easy.  
-Mushrooms. Post-6 you create minefields. You can have high control over dragon and you *could* stop ganks before the enemy even reaches your lane.  
-Mobile. Move quick allows you to run around the map a little more quickly than most.

---------
Cons:  
-EXTREMELY item-reliant. If you do poorly early, you'll likely do poorly mid game as well. You can still be an asset to your team with your mushroom control though. He hardly has any natural strength.  
-Pre-6 ganks you get rocked. Blind doesn't work well against multiple all-in champions, which this meta is all about.  
-True sight wrecks his ult. It's not easy to do, but if you start to become a threat, a single item can hurt.  
-If played as a more fragile build, he can be a glass cannon that gets wrecked without any hard mobility. He just gets bonus movement speed, which isn't awful, but against someone like Shyvana, you'll likely get toasted a few times.  
-If played more defensively with items like Frozen Mallet, he sacrifices his damage and attack speed. Since this would be played instead of a marksman roll, your team loses out on some strength so you can be tankier. It's a hard compromise.


If you think you can keep the enemy controlled while utilizing his mushrooms all over dragon, I could see him being viable. I personally would like to try it. Teemo bot would DEFINITELY be against the normal meta though, so it's hard to say that it would work successfully in most occasions."

And yeah, I don't know where you're coming from, but in the bay area, it's just so standard for everyone to be chill, sex positive, queer friendly (if not just queer), open minded, etc.  The downside is it can seem a little cliqueish and be difficult to make friends - we're unfriendly in the European sense.  It's not that we don't like you, we just have no reason to get to know you, if that makes sense.  But if you already have friends there, that will go far in developing a social circle that works.  And you just have to keep trying.

San Jose and the South Bay isn't my favorite place in the area but you still have amazing food down there (mexican and indian omggggg) and you can always drive/take CalTrain to SF for fun.  And don't overlook the east bay in your journeys.  Oakland is an amazing place full of much friendlier people than SF, plus sunshine, plus OK I have to stop because I'm making myself homesick!

""Aslan was on the move. Now a very curious thing happened.

Perhaps it has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don't understand but in the dream it feels as if it had enormous meaning ...""

Now replace the word Aslan with Jesus plus it feels very much like you are about to be told something very important. Furthermore, Lewis said that he hoped to use the book to ""make it easier for children to accept Christianity when they met it later in life"".

To me it's all a bit insidious for a childrens book. And the view of morality that he presents in it is not only fundementally wrong but also happens to strip all of the good bits of christianity away. This article by Polly Toynbee sums it up nicely for me: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/05/cslewis.booksforchildrenandteenagers

I read it a few years after I had read the books and it put into words what I had always felt but says it much better than I could.

- Me: ""My current employer is offering me X to stay with them. What do you think of that?""
- Company B: ""Ouch. I don't think I can match that. I might be able to go a bit higher than our initial offer though"".
- Me: ""Well, to be honest, I like the job you're offering better, so it's ok if you can't fully match the offer from Company A. How high will you go then?""
- Company B: ""Well, how about Y? I'm sorry, it's the highest I can go""
- Me: ""Close enough. I'll take it!""

Honestly, don't worry too much about hard feelings or anything. Company B will understand perfectly well if you just tell them ""oh, my current job just gave me a 20% raise. That kind of makes me think about staying. Can you sweeten the deal?""

Ingmundar,changemyview,1389824740.0,"You're right in your analysis but your solution is not optimal. The thing is that not many people engage with the political process at its most basic units. Who the fuck is a member or a riding association, part of a campaign, etc.? Not many, so by participating the basic units of a party you begin to have a small amount of sway. If a good number of people do the same in an area, this can rock the make-up of a regional party. 

One of the ways this is done is through unions, how have historically been a driving force behind Labour (and in my native Canada the NDP). So by supporting unionism as well, you tend to help fight the tide of neoliberalism as they are one of the most effective counterbalances to corporatism. 

And at a fundamental level, you as an individual don't get to pick the system that you live in. There isn't going to be a revolution. The Westminster Parliamentary model has been around since the 1680's and has roots that go back much earlier. It will not be toppled. The only thing that's ever happened is that popular movements have changed it. And I figure that agitation from within a party can achieve a lot of what you want as a smaller party needs a large popular base or movement to take flight (one which doesn't currently exist)."

Yep - but one test with a tiny sample size doesn't tell you what the margin of error is, or if your test was conducted properly.

&gt; All it takes is one guy to get arrested and your effort to steal the election fails. 

No - because all the votes other than his succeeded, and the votes, once cast, can't be undone.

&gt; Or you can try for election fraud and get someone who works with the ballots.

That's been done, many times.  [Based on convictions in Indiana, it is a good bet that is how Obama won the 2008 Primary over Hillary.](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/26/officials-found-guilty-in-obama-clinton-ballot-petition-fraud/)

From what you've said, it seems like you still have strong feelings for your ex. It wouldn't be very fair to get into a serious relationship with someone else in that sort of situation. You wouldn't want someone else to do that to you, would you?

“Line up on the left, please.”

The voice came from a man dressed completely in white. His hair was even white. He seemed nice. And glowy. I blinked a couple times. *Yes, that guy is definitely glowing.*

“I’m sorry, what’s going on--” I began, but was promptly handed something and ushered into the left line. There were hundreds of people in front of me. I looked behind me and my jaw dropped at the sheer volume of people being sorted by glowy people dressed in white to various lines. The weird part was how orderly everything seemed. No one was pushing, shoving, yelling, or even talking at all. *Was I just in that mass of people?* I thought to myself. I couldn’t remember. I began to panic slightly. I couldn’t remember anything--not how I got here, not where I was. I looked down at what I had been handed by the man in white.

It was a pamphlet. In big letters at the top, it said “**So You’ve Died: What Now?**” and in smaller text: “**Understanding Judgment.**” I read the title again. *I’ve...died? This must be some weird dream,* I thought. I tried to remember the last thing that happened to me. I remember being with Lina and offering to drive to her mom’s house since she didn’t like driving in bad weather. We got in the car. I remember her suggesting we turn back because the roads were so bad. Then...nothing. 

“My god, did I die?” The realization hit me and I felt my heart sink. I looked around again, this time taking particular stock of my surroundings. The sky was blue, but awfully bright. It was the bluest-blue I’d ever seen. I looked down. I couldn’t help but smile at the sight of my bare feet on the softest, greenest grass. I was wearing the same sort of white clothes the glowy man had been wearing. That confused me.

Behind me, I was surprised to find that the crowd I had seen at first, and the glowing people in white seemed to be very far away. The line was growing behind me. There was a man I was directly in front that looked terrified and was leafing through his pamphlet rapidly, repeating the word “no” over and over. I cleared my throat. He looked up and right through me, as if he couldn’t see me.

“Um,” I started, waving. He didn’t react. I turned back around, confused. I looked at my pamphlet and opened it to the first fold.

**Yes, You’re Definitely Dead**

*Welcome to The Gates. You may or may not have memories of your death. For those that don’t, you might be wondering what is going on. We are happy to inform you that, though you have tragically left your Earthly home, you have returned to your Eternal one. We are glad to have you.*

*You are standing in Judgment Line. This line will take you to The Gates, at which an angel in our Welcoming Committee will ask you three of questions. Based on your responses, and the understanding of your own life, you will either be moved through The Gates to your Fate, or shown a video of your life events until you understand, and are then moved to your Fate.*

I looked up. The Gates were straight ahead--large and golden. There were two sets, both identical, with a brick wall separating them. In front of the brick wall were stationed two white tents that had a large screen on the side facing the pathway that led to the gates. I could see colors flashing, but not the images due to the angle and distance I was from the front. I looked back down at the pamphlet.

**What Are The Fates Available?**

*Fates are determined by a few different factors. Simply put for your understanding, those who lived with goodness in their hearts, provided service to those around them, and sacrificed for the betterment of humankind will be permitted to enter The Gates to a Heavenly Home. Those who did not desire goodness in their hearts, lived selfish lives, and caused intentional harm through their actions will be placed in a home outside of The Gates, where they must dwell for Eternity without True Happiness unless they can prove their heart has changed.*

I closed the pamphlet, and attempted to calm my breathing. My heart was racing. *This is the real deal. This is really about to happen. My entire fate rests on what I did with my life. What did I do with my life?* I closed my eyes and breathed in the air. It was fresher than any Springtime I had ever experienced. As I opened my eyes, I caught a glimpse of something to my left. A dark mist surrounded the area. People at the front of the line occasionally were sent towards it instead of going through the gates. It gave me shivers. I closed my eyes again and tried to remember what happened when I died."

The Revolution Tranquille happened here in Quebec and didn't improve much in terms of basic needs. But it was still an awakening of Quebecois nationalism, a rejection of traditional conservative and religious values and fundamentally altered the functioning of the province. 

Then there are movements like the pro-abortion movement in Canada, had a very small amount of active members. Maybe at its peak thousands. One of the largest demonstrations was carrying a coffin across the country to 24 Sussex Drive and half burying it. That was tens of people who did that. Still abortion was made legalized with in a small period of time.

Lina turned up the heater. The snow was falling with snowflakes large enough to look like pieces of white dryer lint. It was night, but the sky glowed yellow by the streetlights reflecting into the cloudy atmosphere.

“Maybe we should go back,” she said, pulling on her seatbelt nervously. The roads were covered in ice, with a building layer of snow. I was concentrated on the road so intensely that I didn’t answer her for a moment.

“We’re almost there. Just take a deep breath, babe. I know how much you want to see your sister before she leaves. The weather’s just getting worse. If we wait until tomorrow, it might be too late,” I glanced at her out of the corner of my eyes. She managed a smile.

“You’re right. I wouldn’t forgive myself if I missed her again,” she sighed. “I just want us to stop fighting and have things go back to normal.” I put my hand on hers.

“She’ll forgive you,” I said comfortingly. “After all, you forgave her, right?” Lina laughed and nodded, but the worried look didn’t leave her face.

“It took me years,” she whispered. I knew.

As I thought back on the night, tears filled my eyes. Here I was, standing in line for judgment--only thinking of myself. *Lina would pinch me for that if she were here. I wonder where she is.* The panic came back as it occurred to me that if I was dead--was she? As I processed the thought, I prayed she wasn’t. I prayed that I hadn’t killed my wife, my best friend. If she was still alive, I hoped she wasn’t hurt; she had to take care of the kids. *God! The kids!* My level of panic increased. It momentarily subsided when I remembered we had left them with a baby sitter and turned to sorrow.

“I’ll never see them again.” My voice cracked and my chin trembled. I cleared my throat to hold back the tears. My beautiful wife, my two daughters. They were my life. Or were they? I cringed when I thought of the time I skipped their ballet recital for a meeting with my boss. It was to discuss a promotion--one that I ended up not even getting. Lina asked me softly to support the girls instead. I shook my head now, remembering how hard I felt the decision was at the time. Now it seemed so clear. My heart felt heavy. I noticed the line was getting closer to the front. I could hear the sounds of the video screen now. A honk of a car brought me back to that night.

The roads were getting more difficult to navigate and Lina was unable to contain her anxiousness.

“Let’s just pull off at this motel and stay, please,” she motioned to a dimly lit, shoddy-looking motel across the street from the light we were at.

“We really are almost there, honey,” I said with a small laugh. “Plus, what about the babysitter?”

“I’ll call her right now. We can’t let her leave tonight anyway, it’s too dangerous.” Lina picked up her phone and dialed as I sighed and obliged, slowly moving the car to the other lane while we waited for the light.

“Hi Annie!” Lina said excitedly upon having our youngest daughter answer the phone. “Can I speak to the babysitter please?” Her voice finally seemed relaxed. “Okay, thank you sweetie! Love you!” The light turned green. I pulled out into the intersection as my wife began explaining the situation to the babysitter. Midway through, the car slipped on a fresh patch of ice, causing the other tires to become stuck in the snow. I was just about to give up and get out to put the cat litter we kept in the trunk under the tires--hopefully to give them enough traction to get out, when I felt the urge to look to my right.

In the flurry, I was able to make out a truck going way too fast to stop. I looked up and noticed the light had changed while we were stuck there. I remember realizing that he probably couldn’t see us.

Now, I had moved up the line enough that the sounds of the videos were distinguishable. I couldn’t see very well, but I could make out the sounds of laughter. I felt very alone in that moment. I turned behind me to speak to the man, but he still couldn’t see me. I wondered how much time had passed since I had arrived here--since I died. I needed to talk to someone. I looked at the back of the person in front of me. It was a woman. She had dark hair similar to Lina’s. I debated for a moment on whether to attempt to speak to her, but I assumed she wouldn’t hear or see me like the man behind me. I sighed and determined I would try. I reached out and touched her shoulder. She turned and my heart sank."

“Lina?” She looked confused and sad, and didn’t seem to recognize me at first. After a moment, her eyes shone.

“Oh my God, Mark!” She burst into tears. I wrapped my arms around her and began to cry. All I could tell her was how sorry I was and how much I loved her. After what seemed like only moments, yet an age, a man in white tapped Lina on the shoulder. She turned around with a start.

“Ma’am, it’s your turn,” he said gently. She looked back at me and nodded, wiping the tears from her eyes and sniffling.

“We just have a few questions,” he continued. “Do you think you deserve to enter The Gates?”

“I--I don’t know,” Lina answered. He nodded and continued.

“What was your greatest achievement in life?”

“Um, my children, I think,” she said, her voice wavering.

“Do you feel you did all you could to live a fulfilling life?” He asked. Lina fumbled for a moment before beginning to cry again.

“I don’t know,” she sobbed. The man looked at her kindly.

“It’s okay, we can show you.” He turned around as the screen began to show the video of Lina’s life. I watched with awe as it went through the happiest moments of her childhood and college--before I met her. Tears filled my eyes again when our wedding began to play. After that, the video seemed to be showing both our lives. I was amazed at how much we shared all these years: the triumphs, and sadness. Suddenly, the video showed the hospital where both of our daughters were born. Lina reached out and grabbed my hand. My heart felt so full in that moment that I stopped watching the screen and turned to her. Tears were in her eyes as she stared, mesmerized by her own goodness that she seemed only now to be realizing. The video stopped and she looked at the man. He smiled and asked,

“What did that tell you, Lina?” She laughed and smiled, looking back at me again.

“I guess I did more than I thought.” She squeezed my hand. “Well, we did, together.” I smiled at her and squeezed back. The man nodded. He gestured to the gate.

“You may enter your Heavenly Home,” he said. Lina took a deep breath and walked forward until our arms were as far apart as they could be while still holding hands. She stopped and turned back. I smiled, not without some fear in my eyes, and tilted my head at her. I let go. As my hand dropped, she disappeared. I turned to the man.

“My turn?” I asked. He nodded.

“Do you think you deserve to enter The Gates?”

“I never deserved anything my whole life,” I replied.

“What do you consider to be your greatest achievement in life?” He asked. I hesitated, choking back tears.

“...my family,” I answered softly.

“Do you feel you did all you could to live a fulfilling life?” The final question. The tears made it hard to speak.

“If I say no, could I please watch the video again?” The man laughed and turned. The screen began playing my life--our life, and I absorbed every moment. After it was over, he gestured to the gate.

“You may enter your Heavenly Home.” With his words, I walked through. Lina awaited me on the other side. She took my hand again and we began to walk together."

AkiraZXE,truegaming,1389825564.0,"&gt; Dude you're asking a question that is monolithically ambiguous. I think no one ever gives you a serious answer to ""What would a non-sexist game look like"" because shit, like where do you even start? Is it strategy? Action-Adventure? FPS? Platformer? Are there horror elements? What's the primary game mechanic? Who's the antagonist?

I'm not joking when I say this made me dizzy. Aside from the fact that you're saying people ask questions that can't be answered, it's both wrong (by sidestepping the issue) and has entirely missed the point.

&gt; Fundamentally, I'm saying that if there are that many people who take issue with the state of games now, they should come up with a concrete idea about how they want games to be.

Look, it's *right there*. I cannot put it any other way.

You've given me two examples of games. One which under certain conditions may not be sexist (putting aside the ""Mrs. Man"" shit from a few weeks ago and the fact that there's not much to the story or characters in Reach to begin with), and the other which is sexist because there are virtually no female criminals for one, and for two that a bunch of criminals aren't exactly the softest of individuals. So, let me get this straight, it's sexist because the female criminals that do exist aren't cruel enough, and the male criminals treat them badly in one way or another, *and* you want to be able to run around and beat them? So *criminals* can't *talk bad* about women, but it's ok if Batman comes and dislocates their jaw? That would never get the Not-Sexist Seal of Approval. Hell, that's why most nameless fodder in games are male in the first place.

It's not an impossible prompt if you spend a little time thinking about it, which I would think people would have if they also have the time to write paragraphs and paragraphs on ethereal, unanswerable demands. I'm not going to get that, though. Nobody is happy but they won't say what would make them happy. I'd rather just play the games at this point than have pointless discussions about them."

A very good friend of mine was 31 when she was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer.  She lost her fight 6 months later, 2 months before she was to stand up with my wife and I for our wedding.  We are thankful that we got to attend her impromtu wedding at the hospital to her boyfriend of the past several years just days before her passing.

**Don't be ashamed to cry.**  Don't hold it all in...don't try to be strong for anyone else.  When my dad told me he had cancer I was 27 and I cried on my way home while on the phone with my fiance just like I did when I was 10 sitting on my dad's knee whenhe told us grandpa would not be coming home because he passed away in the hospital.  Make sure you have a way to let your emotions out.

DO NOT STOP LIVING YOUR LIFE!  I can not stress this enough.  As a soon to be new parent I understand this better now.  My father told me a week after my engagement party that he was diagnosed with cancer.  He promised he would be at the wedding one way or another...and that he did not want us to change any plans because of him.  My wife and I were willing to move the date up to that summer if it ment he would be there in person.  He would not have it.  Parents always want what is best for thier children.  Your mom would want to make sure you are happy.  Go out with your friends.

Be a good son/daughter.  Make sure to keep mom in the loop.  Talk about your day, your friends, school, work or whatever.  If she asks you to pray with her just do it.  There is no point to standing up for atheism at this time.  If she asks you to go to church with her a few times...go.  It won't hurt you to go out of your way a little for your mom at this time.

Pastors/Priests are a great resource at a time like this.  My friend I referenced earlier who passed away, her sisters priest helped with everything.  For the family and friends he wasn's just a priest he was a councilor.  It did not matter your faith he was there to listen, and he did an amazing job.  Not once did he try to convert me(she was going to be my groomswoman) or tell me I was wrong for my beliefs, he just listened.  My friend was an agnostic, who for her sister and mother converted to Catholicism literally on her death bed.  It was to make them happy and be at peace with her passing.  She had a Catholic wedding cermony 2 days before she left us because it was the 1 thing she really wanted to do, to get married. 

When the time comes and people tell you she is in a better place...that is true.  Be thankful that she will no longer be in pain and no longer suffering.  To me that is better then the alternative.  So just agree with your family...if it makes it easier for them to think she is in heaven don't take that away from them.  As much pain as are in, remembe they are also in pain.  

Life goes on.  You will laugh again, love again, cry and be lost all over again.  It's this journey we call life.  Mom will always be part of you no matter what.  Enjoy the time you have left with her.

I hope you get some good quality time to be able to spend with her at this trying time.  Best wishes for you and your family."

Have you checked the fluid? What level is it at and what is the condition of the fluid? Does it smell burnt, or have metal in it?

First, why are you trying to unnecessarily shift for engine braking and torque? When you down shift for braking, how are you doing it? Second, when you say you get no response, what happens? Do the RPMs change or nothing happens at all?

&gt; *I ran a code scan and it spit out P0710, something about a sensor but this seems unrelated.*

It's not unrelated and in fact can be exactly why you have the problem you have.

http://engine-codes.com/p0710.html

&gt;**P0710 - Transmission Fluid Temperature Sensor Circuit Malfunction**

&gt;**When is the code detected?**
&gt;Transmission Control Module (TCM) detects excessively low or high voltage from the fluid temperature sensor.

&gt;**Possible symptoms**
- Engine Light ON (or Service Engine Soon Warning Light)
- Possible shifting problems

&gt;**P0710 Description**
The Automatic Transmission (A/T) fluid temperature sensor detects the A/T fluid temperature and sends a signal to the Transmission Control Module (TCM).

It should be noted that just because you have this code doesn't necessarily mean the sensor is bad either, it could mean your transmission has been overheated (excessively high voltage) 

also...

&gt;*I normally would just take it to a shop but $105/hr is too much to gamble on when I have no idea what the problem is.* 

It's not too much to gamble. In fact it's not gambling at all. It's paying for shop time diagnostics to find the problem. It takes time to diagnose problems. Time=money.

The ""i'm not going to pay someone to find my problems"" is an entitled sensibility. You're not entitled to anyone working on your car for free.

techlos,audioengineering,1389826199.0,"The trick is very careful clipping on every track, to squash the transients while keeping any distortion harmonic relative to the track. A good rule of thumb is that you should clip no more than 2~3 dB, and clipping should never last more than 20ms. This will usually give you a good 3~6 dB of extra headroom before you even hit the mastering stage.

With mastering, you can repeat the process using a multiband splitter - again, only clip the top of the hardest transients, and only by a small amount. If done correctly, you can have a damn loud mix without even touching a compressor or limiter, leaving you with a loud track where nothing sounds squashed out.

Compression on individual tracks is fine of course, and for EDM it's always nice to sidechain the kick to the bass, but avoiding compression on the master bus can really bring a song to life.

For an example of how it sounds, [here's a track i recently produced with the technique](https://soundcloud.com/death-of-sound/earthshaker). It's nice and loud, about -11 to -9 dB RMS when normalized. It hasn't been mastered yet, but it should give you an idea of how the technique sounds."

BelleLune,breastfeeding,1389826389.0,"I had both of my children in hospitals. One with an OB and one with a midwife. When I had my first child, I was 18 years old and the people surrounding me were not supportive, at all. When baby was cluster feeding or I was having latching problems or even just in the beginning when I was sore and tender, everyone would immediately just say ""that sounds hard, just switch to formula!"" It was so discouraging. I ended up giving up breastfeeding around 4 weeks, because everyone told me he shouldn't be eating so often or so long or that I needed to measure how much he was eating, so I just HAD to give him a bottle. I felt like a failure and I beat myself up over it for a very long time.

When I got pregnant with my second child, I was determined to try again, so I researched as much as I could. I read books, articles, this forum, everything I could find to absorb as much info as I could. And I can't tell you how much it helps to just be knowledgeable about it all. Now when she cluster feeds or when we had a poor latch, I knew what it was and was prepared to deal with it. I knew that it was NORMAL for a BF baby to eat seemingly around the clock or for 45+ minutes at a time. 

The best thing I did this time around was to just go with the flow. Try not to worry and don't watch the clock! If baby is showing hunger cues, feed him/her. If baby wants to nurse for 1.5 hours straight, do your best to just let them nurse. You and baby will figure out what's best for your breastfeeding relationship. Also, we cosleep, and I find that helps SO MUCH with sleeping at night. My LO is teething pretty bad right now and wakes up all through the night just screaming in pain. But she's right next to me, so I can just plop the boob in her mouth to calm her down and we're right back to sleep (thank goodness for the side-laying position).

One thing I had a problem with was latching. Both of my babies didn't have a good latch at first and it caused me a great deal of pain. With baby #1, the hospital just gave me a nipple shield and sent me on my way. But with baby #2, they actually showed me other techniques/positions to get baby to latch better. It still took her a long time to latch properly though and I had a lot of nipple pain for a good 6+ weeks. Try not to let it discourage you. It hurts like a son of a bitch, but I just grit my teeth and stomped my feet until it was over and it's been gravy ever since.

Good luck and remember, you can do it!"

bananaruth,todayilearned,1389826494.0,"&gt; What you describe about the incumbent advantage and whether or not the electorate votes in their own interest is a human problem, not a woman problem.

Last time I checked women were in fact humans. It's a woman problem. Especially if you consider that a large portion of the electorate is women, as you pointed out. 

&gt;  men 50th.

A little dramatic don't you think? If you're one of those people who think men have it the worst, I don't know if I should even bother continuing this discussion. Men, especially white men, have just about as much privilege as anyone does, if not more. Yes, of course men do have unique problems (I find it appalling that some people treat all men like pedophiles and feel uncomfortable with them being around children), but many complaints that I hear are nearly trivial. i.e the often cited ""false rape accusations"" that ruin men's lives. Sure, a very small percentage of women may lie about it and it's terrible for the man, but the vast majority of reported rapes are not false accusations. I swear, every time I read about rape on reddit, someone replies with ""But the false rape accusations *ruin lives!!!!* They happen lyke all the time!!!"". It takes away from the much larger and equally devastating issue of rape. Rape also can ruin lives and unfortunately happens much more frequently than false reports.

The problem is that I'd also find it a little worrying if anyone said that they didn't think a black president would do a good job. Clearly there is something wrong there. I do believe that most women in the US would support a female candidate (assuming the were of the same party).

I know that I always listen completely and believe everything that advise givers have told me over my lifetime. /s 
I probably should have listened, but it's one thing to hear and another to act on what you hear. I do believe that men *can* do a good job (listening to advisers and all). I said that. My problem is with folks like the guy in the interview I linked. Not every man does. Simply having a woman in office would be a much simpler way to make sure women's interests are represented. 

I disagree completely. Empathy is entirely necessary. Back to the guy in the video. He was anti-abortion, yet was stumped by the question of why a woman would want to get an abortion. If he had ever attempted to empathize with a woman about the abortion issue, he might have had a better understanding about the issue. 

Empathy: noun
1. the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

I don't think you have the definition of empathy right here. Empathy has nothing to do with the person with the problem and it certainly doesn't ""dull the pain, giving hope and refocusing attention elsewhere"". That's nonsensical. What empathy does is allow for one person to picture themselves in another person's shoes. It doesn't have to be some deep moment shared between friends over a dead relative. It can simply be reading about a problem and feeling for a second upset and wondering what it must be like for the person. This helps to figure out possible, realistic solutions to problems. "

keypuncher,conservatives,1389826656.0,"&gt; So you will reject it when the implications look bad for position.

No, I reject that the results are exact, when only one test with a tiny sample size was used.  If you are going to argue otherwise, I'll keep that in mind for our future discussions.

&gt; Try to think about what you propose. An organized effort involving hundreds or thousands of people to rig an election where people are almost certain to go to jail.

The certainty of going to jail is your assertion not mine.  I propose that the individuals committing the fraud are so rarely caught, have so little liability if caught, and have so few ties back to the people who paid them to do so, that the people involved are almost certain to *not* go to jail.

&gt; So it could be much higher even.

Or virtually zero, if the fraud were committed in a different way."

DrPepperHelp,E_Cigarette,1389826728.0,"I have spent more than that on a tank. YES. They are 1000% worth it. They give you more control over your vape experience. Even the type of drip tip you use affects the flavor.

My current setup includes a Tatroe T1 RDTA. It is basically is a top cap for a dripper with a tank mounted on top. It came with a single 1/16th air hole. It now has 2 3/32nd air holes for my dual coil setups. I also have Rocket Science Mods drip tip that helps to reduce heat from my drippers. Flavor 11,000,000,000/10

My other everyday setup is a Russian 91%. It is stock the only thing that might stand out about it is that I use cotton in it, the same drip it from the T1, and that it has a 1 ohm micro coil. Flavor is a 90,000,000,000/10.

But what about down sides? Price, rebuilding, batteries, chargers, mods, and a whole slew of other issues, BUT they don't leak like some geriatric mental patent. What they do do is provide flavor. Do your priorities lay with your hard earned cash, or do they lay with your taste buds.

Also keep in mind that you only pay insane prices once per item. After that you only need wick and wire to keep them running. You may need to buy butane or propane for your torch every so often as well, but that is not really that expensive. I have been doing RBAs for about 4 months now. So far I have used about 66.6 feet of 28 gauge Kanthal, about 6 or 7 cotton balls, and ~30 ft of 30 gauge Kanthal, probably about 2/3rds of a talk tank of propane from Home Depot, and I am just now starting to look into replenishing my propane (I have torched a few things.) and Kanthal. Everything else is doing fine. My whole build kit probably has had close to $350 put into it so far. That also includes a drill, drill bits, a storage box, an ohm checker, multimeter, and some other odds and ends. Other than that most of my vape budget goes to Juice or new devices to get a better flavor experience out of the juice."

We are at a constant war with our bodies. Once fat, your body will try to get back that way. So when you lose any weight, your body will give you triggers to trick you into getting more calories into your system.

You need to counter this and always be mindful of your intake. Forever. Once you reach your target weight, you don't have to count every calorie, but you need to continue to weigh yourself and as soon as you see a trend of gaining weight again, then it's back to countinh calories. 

Do this, and you will lose weight and it will stay off. But understand that you are never ""done"". "

What I found that worked for me, breaking into b2b, was a mix of the simple things: always carry cards, always be prepared to talk about what you do and how it can help (the infamous elevator pitch) and always ask for referrals. We go back through our client base every 6 months and ask how things are going, and flat out ask if they know anyone that might need our help. Also, we paired up with local sales people...outside sales people in the telecom industry, for example, was a huge boon for us. They're already out pounding pavement, knocking on doors and getting in front of the decision makers. Together, we offered a one stop shop for our clients. Having trouble with your office DSL? Turns out it's not a telco issue but one with your network, and I know a local company that can get you taken care of PDQ. Also, bookkeepers and accountants can be a great ""in"". You'll have to work out your own comp plan for these leads but often it isn't cash they want (although I've yet to see a salesman turn down $50-100) but most likely leads of their own.

What if marriage was no longer a government issue? What I mean to say is: what if the government had no say in marriage and all unions were treated the same. So if a church wants to refuse to marry gay people, you can go find one that will or start your own. Marriage is, after all, a religious creation (edit: by this I mean marriage, a long time ago, became a sacrament and not just a familial agreement to give away one's daughter for wealth or status), so I'm not entirely sure why gay people even want to get married besides the government benefits. Once those are taken away from *everyone*, would it even matter or be desired? Just genuinely curious, I support gay marriage because married people get benefits and gay people are just that, people. Just like everyone else. But I don't think the government should be involved in the first place."

But this thread is about each of our own asshole opinions, and I know myself better than you. And I would say that even if I had a dozen (normal) children. If the next was to be born with a severe disorder or disease, I would abort.

The thread as a whole addresses sexual behavior in young children in general. Humans are sexual and flirtation, kissing, touching, and experimenting are normal and healthy in children. 

It was all fine and dandy until, /u/r04r04r (who is a nanny like myself) mentioned that children under his/her supervision had oral sexual intercourse with each other along with innocent playful nudity/touching. 

As a fellow nanny, I was horrified that children were engaging in (incestuous if you care about that kind of thing) sexual intercourse. I rather curtly suggested that his/her supervision was inadequate as the sexual intercourse that was taking place is very damaging to children. 

After several people dismissed the event as harmless fun childhood behavior I felt it necessary to remind people that childhood sexual intercourse is harmful and inappropriate. It is by standard definition, rape, because children cannot give consent. 

Many people are (or at least seem to be) suggesting that sexual intercourse between children is normal. I don't care how frequently it happens. It is very dangerous for (young) children to have sex and we should prevent to the best of our capacity. 

I always thought it was common knowledge that sex ought to be between consenting adults. Quite frankly, I'm a surprised and concerned that so many people are offended by what I am saying. "

Back in the sixties when I knew a thing or two about stereo systems and even built an amp and a radio, THD and RMS power were the thing along with some inventive advertising word like music power versus RMS.

RMS is the average calculated power of a sine wave produced by the amp in steady state, whereas peak power, or music power may refer to what the amp can do for a few milliseconds during a transient passage in the music before blowing a circuit. In other words it ain't real in terms of maintaining a certain DB level in the room.

And 1% THD is awful.  Good amps like Denon or McIntosh had THD readings like .1% or .05% however 1% or less is not audible to humans.

What the THD rating on continuous max power delivered to 4 ohms. means is that at below the 1% threshold the amp should drive the speakers well without audible distortion.

If you are gonna run the amp into speakers at full load, distortion can have a bad effect and might blow a driver. Or so said the wisdom of the time."

Chances of you somehow managing to cope with depression through alcohol and maintaining something even remotely resembling a functioning, healthy life are rather slim, to say the least.

The only thing that didn't seem right was the chocolate sauce. There's not NEARLY enough whipping cream for the amount of cocoa and sweetener and so I ended up adding a ton of whipping cream. It still came out super thick and sort of pudding-y so I just spooned a bit on the top and did away with the rest. There was soooo much of it. Also, rather than making my own whipped cream, I just grabbed some lite whipped cream in a can. I also decided to garnish with an orange wedge buuuuut I picked up a blood orange on accident so it looks a little silly. But, it was delicious anyway. It made 8 servings easy.

palapiku,piano,1389829284.0,"Several good theories here. To the best of my knowledge, the answer is this:

It was very common practice for performers during Mozart's time (as well as Baroque) to add ornamentation to a piece. A performer could take sheet music and just play it as written, but more commonly he would add a bunch of ornaments, including appoggiaturas. Appoggiaturas sound nice and are easy and tempting to add.

So Mozart notated his own appoggiaturas as such, because that's what they are and *to prevent performers from attempting to insert their own appoggiatura before his*. He does this everywhere, not just in the Turkish Rondo."

I'd consistantly be getting mouthfuls of liquid, or it would gurgle and spew it into my mouth. However, when it wasn't doing that, it was pretty great.

I've been using iClear 30 for a couple of months now. The key to not having this happen is to keep it vertical at all times except for turning it horizontal for a couple of seconds between each puff.

zattacks,cscareerquestions,1389829458.0,"Your knowledge of Android development isn't static. If you're concerned about your current qualifications, figure out what needs shoring up (even if that includes more theoretical constructs like data structures and algorithms) and actively work toward augmenting your skillset. Based on your post, you already appear to be doing this. So, in short, just focus on learning more and don't dwell on how qualified someone might find you.

As far as applying for jobs is concerned: go for it. The worst that can happen is rejection, and then you're, at worst, exactly where you started. You'll get more qualified with Android development as time goes on if you keep working on your skills. Definitely get a robust and functional app on Google Play and on other peoples' devices. Having published apps will help you immensely. Naturally, you'll know more about Android development after your course ends. That said, don't let that stop you from applying to jobs - just go for it! What do you have to lose?

Some background on myself (for perspective). I'm a college senior who has taken a one-semester course on Android development (with a little bit of software engineering). My final project from this course is now on Google Play and I have many ideas for extending it. I consider myself a good programmer, though far from the best at my school.

Now I know a lot of people view the Kinsey scale as outdated and I also know a lot of people would call this kind of attraction ""bisexual"", but sexuality isn't really 100% defined with solid borders(and that was kind of the point of the Kinsey scale).

If someone tells you they think they're homosexual, but still like you, even though you're opposite gender, it's just plain fucking rude to straight up tell them ""lol no, I know your sexuality better than you do"". If you give them another label than they give themselves, that's exactly what you're doing.

I mean, obviously there are extreme cases and common sense applies. If someone has slept with opposite genders their whole life and plans on doing so in the future, they're not homosexual, and you have every right to tell them that you don't think they're using the label right.

Nothing biased about it. They did some investigating, contacting sources in the Heat organization, and reported that the Heat weren't interested.

&gt;It is a FACT and a high probability that the Heat might waive Douglas to sign Bynum.

It is a fact that they could waive Douglas to sign Bynum, yes. Why do you think it is such a high probability? Their sources told them before it was unlikely. Adding Bynum could be more likely because they now lost a big man, but maybe their sources said nothing has changed. And Joel was little more than depth anyway, averaging 3.1 minutes/game this season (and averaged 5.1 in the post season last year).

&gt;Why keep a 3rd PG when they have 0 healthy true centers?

Because maybe the organization is a little concerned about Dwyane Wade and Mario Chalmers since they have been having injury issues.

Suddenly it all made sense, how he seemed so comfortable and secure when I first met him, yet kept doing little things that I associated with insecure guys, like giving me backhanded compliments and bragging about how cashiers where flirting with him etc. 

That relationship had left me really confused for a while, because I couldn't understand how I had misjudged his character and personality that much. 

So, my opinion, it can give people the confidence to talk to women and can make them appear confident at first glance, but I think most people need a lot more work to actually become a confident person.

He gave me this advice: Don't do anything permanent. Give yourself a time frame, and experiment as fully as you can. So go as far as possible in transition without making a permanent change. Binding, packing, dressing, switching names, switching genders, using men's rooms, voice training, thinking of yourself as a guy, etc. Then, analyze how you feel. Was it right? Do you feel more male, or still just not female? Did the dysphoria change? Do you want permanent changes? And so on. 

By fully committing to one side, you change your perspective, and may notice things you hadn't before. So far you've been living as a female, so you know what existing from that perspective feels like.  Spend a couple months living as a male, and get a taste of that perspective. Once you know both sides, you'll be in a better position to decide. "

CadHuevFacial,AskReddit,1389830567.0,"I agree with you for the most part, but something I think you are extremely uninformed about is that feminism absolutely agrees with the notion that men should be eligible for as much parental leave as women are. Feminists are fighting for gender equality among many things and, for the most part, believe the system that marginalizes women (patriarchy) is the same system that prevents men from seeking paternity leave, or that leads men to feel hesitant or uncomfortable crying/showing emotion/vulnerability/forming strong emotional bonds with friends, etc.

With a charity if they mess up they can end up having all their funding disappearing, but you can't stop paying your taxes. Someone who is well informed sometimes has to make a decision based on the evidence rather than the emotions, which you can only do when in power. If you want an example see the Daily Show's report on the gun law changes in AUS. People didn't want to lose their guns and some people didn't get voted back into office but the rate of gun murders and suicides plummeted afterwards. It was a logical but highly unpopular choice.

thesilvertongue,Parenting,1389830763.0,"Thanks for clearing that up. 

However, the term you used before was ""oral sex"" so you shouldn't be unreasonably upset when it is interpreted as a kind of sexual intercourse. That's what comes to mind most often when people use the word.

Children having sexual intercourse is technically rape by definition as children cannot give consent. Your accusations of me as ""fear mongering"" are unfounded. It wasn't unreasonable that I was upset at the idea of young children engaging in sexual intercourse. 

Furthermore, I'm not entirely convinced of your argument that ""kissing the vulva"" isn't penetration or sex so therefore cannot technically be rape. Court precedents tend to disagree. But you're the one who saw it so I'm not going to argue with you. 

Anyway, the moral of the story is sex needs to be between consenting adults. Any form of sexual intercourse between children (which includes all forms of oral sex) is completely wrong. "

Cerberus150,AskReddit,1389830799.0,"It isn't that simple.  Not even close.  You are looking at it with the assumption that the supply of jobs will always meet or outstrip the demand for employment.

Not to mention, in a purely capitalist system, collusion between companies would be perfectly legal.  The only reason that practice isn't widespread *is because of government regulation.*  If you think that America is a purely capitalist society, you're ignoring mountains upon mountains of business legislation.

But hey, my argument doesn't even need to be hypothetical.  We already have an international system which mimics precisely what you would want on the national level.  In the globalized system, labor costs are overwhelmingly a race to the bottom.  This is because companies can, **and almost unanimously do**, give their workers as little as possible in order to maximize profits.  This would *most assuredly* happen on a national level without minimum wage laws.  With a much larger supply of labor available than jobs, it is definitely an employer-dictated market, a fact which would result in a similar race to the bottom if minimum wage laws weren't preventing such practices."

Maybe I've gotten lucky, but I've found several feminist communities here and elsewhere that I think are really welcoming to outsiders (men and women) who genuinely want to learn more about what feminism *actually* is and are looking for respectful answers to the inflammatory opinions being spewed by people who are wrongfully representing the entire movement."

I, for one, want to see the effects the players have stretch beyond the mobile phone screen. Face it, MUs are meaningless to most people. Who really cares what your faction is doing in China; you're more concerned about those local frogs/smurfs setting up blocking links, finding your guardians, or blowing your farm up the second you leave town.

But in a concentrated multi-media experience, one can incorporate the game and the movie much more deeply. It can go beyond promotion (Year Zero) and can become part of the mythos.

Picture this: a movie experience streamed to theaters (not on reels like traditional cinema) that has optical signals that an app is designed to read. You're sitting in the theater wearing your Google Glass (because they are cheap as hell by now and EVERYBODY has one) and the camera reads the signals on the screen during a pivotal moment: say a *Hackers* scenario where there's 3D virtual space to navigate in while hacking. Characters on the screen are desperately trying to encrypt the most important files (because face it, a plot is not engaging if the important files were properly encrypted from the get go, and nobody ever just ""pulls the plug"" to defend from a hack in Hollywood) but a call to a virtual society/gang/army goes out to help: provide dummy files, trace the signal back, what have you. That's where the signal on the screen is ready by Glass, and the GPS location confirms you're in a theater. On your Glass you see a variety of tasks you can uptake as an answer to this call from help: maybe you signed up before seeing the movie to play on the hacker's side, maybe defense. Either way, you choose which interactive activity you want to do on your Glass right there in the theater while watching the movie. Your cell data transmits your actions to the movie servers and it seamlessly collects all the data from all the participants and transitions to the appropriate plotline midstream.

One time you go and you successfully defend the hack, and the good guys win and Hollywood makes you happy and feel good.

Other times you go, and the bad guys get the file, your failure costs the life of a main character, and you are genuinely affected from within the 4th wall.

How awesome of an experience would that be?

Because basically, it's those choose your own adventure VHS or DVD games in a cellular world."

pertichor,AskReddit,1389832170.0,"Okay. What you said is fair enough. I honestly don't know what it would be like to have a child. I might in fact jump from one side of the spectrum to the other like you did. My love very well might get the best of me and I might listen to my emotions.

But listening to your emotions isn't good. Maybe instead of listening to emotions, you listened to your brain, you wouldn't have tried to get back together with your ex. Maybe you wouldn't have killed that man who angered you.

I'm just saying that right now, with my mind in clarity, no emotions involving a child, it would be a bad decision for me to have a child like that. I know that ultimately, I would always feel unfulfilled. Even if I'm happy with that kid, there will always be a sense of unfulfillment.

I know it's selfish, or that's what many others would call it. But I see it as merely being self-interested. After all, if you abort early when the fetus is barely formed, you're not taking anything from your child, not even its life yet because it doesn't have one. This all goes back to how each of us view abortion and the conception of life, I guess.

**********

At the back of my head, I'd always think. Maybe he could've been an engineer. Maybe she could've been a doctor. Maybe he could've been a lawyer. Maybe she could've been the president. Sure if your kid amounts to a drug addict, that's unfulfilling too, but they're already an adult and they do have a life, a life you can't take away.

Also, I agree your example of Stephen Hawking is a great example of a person with a disorder yet great contributions. But saying, ""You can't abort, what if they're a scientific genius?"" is akin to saying, ""You have to abort, what if they're the next Hitler?"""

One day during sophomore year of Highschool I decided to brig a few zip-ties to school and zip-tie some kids backpacks. So I did it to a couple friends at first, no big deal. But then it started getting out of hand, people became fearful, protecting their backpacks as if they were children. Zip-ties became a form of currency. Teachers even asked who got zipped at the beginning of each class, and there were always at least 2 or 3 hands that would go up. Well one day a teacher saw me zip-tieing my friends back pack. And she told me to cut it so he could get his stuff. But I had upped my game, I had some thick ass zippys. And when I tried to cut it, the scissors broke, and gave me a deep gash from the nail to the knuckle on my pointer finger. I just stated at the blood and watched it run down my hand, why didn't this hurt? So I raised my hand and asked the teacher if I could go get stitches. Well they ended up banning the student possession of zip-ties within my entire school district because of my injury, little did they know, I had brought this hell upon them, and at the same time had put it out.

depression isn't a ""worse"" sadness. its a different *kind* of sadness. a lateral movement, a dimensional translation. i suffer from depression, and i know and believe with all my heart that the world is a beautiful place. I love my life, and I'm so happy that I am exactly where I am today. But sometimes, i get afflicted by this malady that doesn't change any of that, but still makes me start to doubt myself for no good reason, which, by the way, is the worst part. I personally get depressed because I *know that i'm depressed.* It feels like a personal failure, an out-of-character moment. I agree with you on most of your points, but the fact is that there is a chemical imbalance in my brain that makes me behave and feel strangely, against all logic. 

Depression is real, and it is an issue that most people can't really understand. 

That said, if i meet one more tweenaged tumblrite who tells me she diagnosed her own depression i'm gonna get *really fucking bummed out.*

People in Bronze are totally inept.  They have no idea how to win, no idea what the game is about, no idea what to do in any given moment, and no mechanical skill whatsoever at any champion.  They tend to rage a lot.

People in Silver have no idea how to win and no idea what they should be doing at any given moment.  They may occasionally make a mechanical play that looks impressive, but most of the time their mechanics are bad.  They have no consistency whatsoever.  They rage a lot, and usually think they know more about the game than they do.

People in Gold are starting to grasp the basic concepts of what it takes to win a game, but they are usually wrong and make bad calls despite thinking they know what they are doing.  They frequently make good mechanical plays on one or two champions but they are very inconsistent and cannot be relied on to make a good decision or a correct mechanical play.  They tend to rage at others because they are good enough to recognize the strengths of their own play, but not good enough to see their weaknesses.

People in Plat have a good general understanding of what it takes to win a game, but they often throw winnable games by making bad decisions.  They are starting to become mechanically consistent with a small pool of champions, and occasionally they make good plays, but they just as frequently make terrible ones.  They understand how to follow-up to a good play FAR better than gold or below (this is the first bracket where teamwork is major a factor in winning and losing).

People in Diamond V-I @ 50 or less LP understand the general concepts of the game and how to win.  They might be decent at 1 or 2 champions mechanically, but never more than that, though they can usually play all five roles competently.  They consistently play well and occasionally make impressive plays.  They play confidently, expecting their teammates to follow up on their plays.

People at Diamond 1 50-100LP and Challenger are trolls (but I don't have any personal experience playing with people at this level)."

Davis is the only guy who you can make a case for off potential but he's not as good right now and it would be a massive gamble.

If there was a fantasy draft right now, GMs would be looking to get the elite SF talents, and then centers/power forwards.  Lebron/Durant/George/Howard would be my consensus top 4, with Melo being a likely 5.

We left the strip club ( I don't remember which one it was but it was one of the ones on the east side of 360 in Arlington  back in the mid 90's ) after a VIP room party for a bachelor buddy and got a few strippers to come home with us. as soon as we got home we all dropped some really potent X and smoked some good shit. dude was  a dick about smoking cigs inside though so a few of us that smoked had to go outside. The X started kicking in and I ended up sitting on the front lawn and this stripper chick came and sat down across from me.



 I'm pretty fucking high and we just sat there staring at each other and then we started talking telepathically. I shit you not. We both kinda realized what we were doing at the same time and freaked out. So we had this weird telepathic conversation and then her stripper friend came outside to check on her and saw us just staring at each other and she started speaking words and asking her friend what was going on and  it kinda broke our communication. she tried to tell her friend what was happening and her friend started freaking out thinking i had played some trick on her and was doing something underhanded or some shit. she picked her up and dragged her inside.






 I sat there for about 10 minutes and smoked another cigarette contemplating if what I thought just happened really happened. my friend came out soon and dragged me into his car since the stripper chicks stripper friend was now inside freaking out on me thinking i had done some weird brain shit on her girlfriend..  drove home in a mercedes convertible ( my friends car, he drove ) at 2 am high as fuck and peaking on X. it was still a good night.




 I've done a lot of LSD and shrooms and shit and kinda like to think I know when I am hallucinating and shit, and I later developed some minor auditory hallucinations. but I swear to fucking whatever that that shit really happened.





 The only thing that sorta freaks me out about the whole night is I remember licking a strippers nipple quite a bit and later some one pointed out that maybe some other dude had licked that stippers nipple that night as well. fuck it. who cares."

You mentioned she took a test that used blue dye. Blue dye tests are notorious for what is called an evaporation line. That means that after the recommended test reading time the urine in the test evaporates and the reading box dries of urine. This can cause what looks like a faint, discolored ""positive"" line.

If she hasn't cheated on you, then she is not pregnant. It is not scientifically possible. Her period is most likely late due to her stressing out about thinking she's pregnant. By a test that uses pink dye, like a first response early result, and have her take it using her first morning urine.

**Nose:** Murica! Pine tar and Vanilla, bitterness, faint heat and candied pecans (Guessed: Wild Turkey Rare Breed)

**Taste:** Candy, somewhere between warmth and heat, spice (could be rye or the higher ABV), pretty standard vanilla, caramel, etc etc.  Seems a touch sweeter than a ""standard"" bourbon, that's the only stand out flavor. 

**Finish:** Medium to long, vanilla, Sour Apple Jolly Ranchers and cassia

Every time they came over, my aunt would barrage me with questions about where I was in life. How's school? Do you have a girlfriend? Is she cute? How's your job? I kept my responses modest, but no matter what I said, she would bring up her own son with a look of defeat in her eye.

Jacksambuck,PurplePillDebate,1389834619.0,"&gt;She is informally described as the grandmother of feminism! That is, her ideas gave birth to the generation that gave birth to feminism.

She would have had more than enough time to grandmother Elisabeth Cady Stanton, who was born when Wollstonecraft would have been 56.

&gt;""He"" and ""him"" are discussing male norms and gender roles, not actual men. In other words, it is attempting to poetically embody the notion of patriarchy in a way for some people to better understand what is being discussed.

Haha what a load of hoseshit. So you're now reduced to redefining words to defend this crap. 

&gt;""They try to escape by identifying with the oppressor, living through him, gaining status and identity from his ego, his power, his accomplishments.""

Substitute him and his with ""male norms and gender roles"", and it doesn't make sense. Since when do norms have egos and accomplishments? Also, ""she"" is a general female person, but ""him"" is some immaterial , totally not male, concept? 

&gt;Notice how the ""finallyfeminism"" blog discusses it without reference to hating or blaming men?

Feminists do not like to admit it, especially on a site dedicated to answering critics. The clearly anti-men part I quoted is where they dropped the ball. 

Most of the time, it's implicit, as in the ""externalizing/internalizing"" stuff I described. 

 Or this;

&gt;It’s infinitely easier to lash out at other women — who don’t have the institutionalized authority to hurt us or take away what power we may have gotten — and label them as “the problem”, but that doesn’t get us any closer to solving the problem. Indeed, by shifting the blame and creating a scapegoat we’re just helping to obscure the root of the problem: sexist beliefs and institutions. 

IOW, don't blame women ever, focus on ""sexist beliefs and institutions"". I don't see her advising the same caution in blaming men, though, so what do you think will happen? 


Actually, it's funny, the further down the article you go, the more they drop the pretense that it's not about *men*. More unalducorated blame of men, feel free to present your ""poetic license argument"" as often as you like:


&gt;I think we’re harsher on our own gender both because those who have “fallen” are a reminder that our own tenuous position in male-dominated social circles is gifted by **men**, and can be as easily taken away


-

&gt;Another explanation for women’s acceptance of benevolent sexism is that it is a form of self-protection in response to **men’**s sexism.

pertichor,AskReddit,1389834645.0,"I would abort my child with a severe disorder or disease, but I would definitely not support eugenics.

Eugenics is not a bad idea in theory, but people are fallible and susceptible to bad judgment.

One day it's stopping those with down syndrome or progeria. Then it might be stopping the birth of short or stupid people. Stupid people? The next it could be reducing the birth rates of certain minorities with higher crime rates or lower IQ averages. If eugenics ever came into practice, it would be the start of our demise.

In addition, who is to decide what qualities are valuable? I personally believe that intelligence is because it is the mostly likely to put you at a decent salary (which is everything). But,

1. What if some people say athleticism? What if some say good looks? You do realize that we would shift towards shittier pro sports and uglier people. (there would still be good looking and athletic people but less)

2. 1 sounds like it's saying intelligent people can't be athletic or good-looking. But let's be straight here: the better someone is at one category, the more likely to be average or less than stellar in other categories. It's possible, but not likely.

3. Most people are average. Yet most people think they're above average. No offense, but I bet you that a shockingly large amount of the people suggesting eugenics would actually be getting the short end of the stick. I.e., you're probably not as smart as you think you are, and eugenics would *limit* your progeny."

A friend of mine from high school who also went to the college wanted me too join his fraternity. The dues ($200/year) didn't sit well with me, so he offered that I come to one of their parties to see how I liked it before I committed. 

I jumped at the chance. I only knew of frat parties through movies, so I went there expecting togas, debauchery, anonymous sex with infinite hot girls, etc.

I get to the house and there are maybe 30 people there. 

Two...TWO...of them are girls. Both of them were girlfriends of brothers. 

There was some faint music and a few brothers were half-heartedly playing a game of beer pong, but other than that, it was downright depressing. Brothers sat around, smoking cigarettes, drinking cheap beer, and watching televised hockey. 

Again, this was billed as a PARTY. 

Needless to say, I opted not to pledge the frat, as I didn't want to pay $200 a semester to hang out in an environment that was basically my uncle's bachelor pad. "

This is assuming that power doesn't work over the phone. Some powers, like force choke just require line of sight. It'd save a lot of time if I didn't have to go there in person and could just call up everyone important in one big conference call. 

After that I'd fly down to Mexico and ask those vigilante guys where the leaders of the worst cartel were. I'd take them all out single-handedly, then move on to the next cartel and repeat that until my 24 hours were up.

OlderThanGif,askscience,1389836519.0,"What you're describing (~365.26 days) is the sidereal year. That's the length of time it takes for the Earth to return to same position ""in space"" relative to the Sun. I.e., the sidereal year is how long it takes for us to return to a position where all the stars (which, for all intents of purposes, we'll think of as being in a fixed position) will be in the same spot.

The tropical year is ~365.24 days long. That's how long it takes for the Sun to return back to the same position in our planet's seasonal cycle.

Our calendar year is based off of the tropical year instead of the sidereal year because (presumably) it's more useful for our calendar to be matched up with the seasons than with the stars. That's why we have slightly less than 1 leap year every 4 years (instead of slightly *more* than 1 leap year every 4 years).

As to why the sidereal year and tropical year are different, that has to do with the precession of the equinoxes. The axis around which we're rotating isn't totally stationary. The axis moves a little bit: essentially our planet is wobbling. Since our seasons come from our axial tilt, this wobble means that our seasonal (tropical) year comes very slightly ahead of our positional (sidereal) year and hence the seasonal year is slightly shorter."

polysyllabist,AskReddit,1389836620.0,"It's easy to sarcastically ask someone for help behind the blinds of anonymity.

It's really hard to do so face to face on the street. You wouldn't beg unless you were desperate. It's exceptionally rare for someone to ask for that kind of help before they've reached a point with no other options.

Those people you see aren't people who just wish their loans were paid off, they're off living scraps of contentment day to day.

If I met you on the street and you asked me for help I'd give it. Because for every one person unashamed to humble themselves for help they don't need such as you, there are nine people asking who do need, and one person who needs desperately. I'll gladly embrace a philosophy that gets it so wrong once in order to help those who do need it the other ten times."
royalsiblings,incest,1389836621.0,"Haha, yes, hello! And it's awesome. :D

As for myself, as someone totally turned on by incest but not actually attracted to any of my family members, I've thought about the ""Why?"" of it a lot. (It'd make more sense if I was attracted to someone in my family to begin with imo!)  For me a lot of it is the taboo/forbidden aspect.  You know it's wrong, but the love/attraction is so strong it doesn't matter. And I find the more taboos you stack, the more I enjoy it. Like normally I have no interest in pregnancy, but brother/sister pregnancy is super hot to me because of the taboo of it. Make one a celibate priest/nun or some other taboo and it just multiplies, lol. Could be similar for you.

I think a general roleplaying could be fairly easily introduced, especially if you start with other more common ones like doctor/nurse, fireman/rescued woman, move to teacher/student and then daddy/daughter (maybe daughter from teacher/student brings home a bad report card and daddy punishes, or something, idk what your kinks are).  But that seems like a fairly innocent way to suggest it without being all ""incest fetish omg!!!""  I also think Daddy/Daughter tends to be one of those ones that is more overly acceptable without necessarily crossing into incest territory. More so than brother/sister anyway.

Either way, good luck. :)"

You see, there is a price you pay for everything you use to manufacture these things, for transport, work hours, etc. It is basic supply and demand. To provide the supply, certain things have to be paid for, but unless he earns more than he pays, it isn't sustainable.

Logically, the further away you go, the more you have to pay. And since he wants his product to spread, he will undoubtedly have to pay more.

Now assume he doesn't raise the price. At some point his money will run out. That would mean he has to stop production and his product wouldn't get made anymore. That wouldn't help anybody, especially not the farmers who actually really need it. Wouldn't that be the real shame?

So what he has to do is raise the price enough to make it sustainable. Whether that's $7 or $12 depends entirely on the costs, but it is something that has to be done, in order to get his product out there.

blaghart,halo,1389836920.0,"Actually Chief has taken many, many, many overcharged plasma pistol shots to the head without shields and without being crippled.  So has Noble Six (though admittedly Noble six survived probably about a quarter as many plasma shots to the head while unshielded given that he's participated any about a quarter as many games...)

And Kurt was killed in a cheap way, as was Dante.

And the spartan IIs didn't save the galaxy.  Master Chief did.  And, as has already been established, much of Chief's success is due to Cortana (or else he never woulda made it out of the Truth and Reconcilliation) his luck (or else he woulda died all those times he jumped from orbit or crashed his spacecraft like dozens of other spartans have) or his ability to respawn at the nearest checkpoint after dying.  Either way, suggesting that the spartan IIs are better than the SIVs because of *one incredibly superhumanly lucky spartan* is like saying that the red baron's performance proves that WWI fighter pilots are better fighters than a modern fighter pilots.

As to taking down covy supercarriers, it's been done by IIIs and by IVs (see, spartan ops and Halo Reach).  They've also taken down shipyards (see, spartan ops, spartan assault).  And they've assassinated far tougher targets than prophets (hell Chief didn't even get to kill the arguably most powerful prophet of all).

As to your ""they've never been captured"" malarky, of course not, the Spartan IIs and IIIs weren't tough enough to survive capture so they died instead (see various spartan IIs who died during reach and noble 6 who died rather than get captured).  Meanwhile Spartan IVs not only survived worse injuries only to spend the next sequence utterly eviscerating every covenant they could get their hands on, but they've done it several times.  And just ask anyone who's been in the military:  A captured man who escapes is far more valuable than one who dies.  Hell you don't even need to ask the military, just think about it logically.  A dead spartan II can't keep up the fight.  A captured Spartan IV who escapes, can.

As far as ""getting slaughtered"" gek had a few spartan tags.  Meanwhile there are currently 4 unmarked survivors of the Spartan II procedures and deployments out of the 75 who were conscripted.  That puts them at a 5% survival rate.  Spartan IVs however have upwards of an 80% survival rate despite engaging superior numbers of forces."

And the more taboo the more attractive I find it.  And of course based on some childhood experiences (that is, things like thinking Luke and Leia were more compatible than Han and Leia and not really getting/caring why they couldn't be together; being brother/sister just wasn't a good enough excuse to me as a kid).

Really? I thought feminists were like a dynasty. Presumably, they ate all the men they reproduced with as soon as copulation was over.

&gt;I don't see how it's possible to interpret it any other way.

Let me help you there. ""the oppressor""= men. ""Him""=men, Man


&gt;..Since that's more or less the definition of 'norm' used in this context. Success and accomplishments are defined by the male norms; i.e. what is traditionally male is viewed as good and right.

Where's ""egos""?


&gt;So your quotemine is evidence that an ideology predicated on the notion of hating and blaming men is too afraid to state anywhere, in any document or speech, throughout the entirety of its history, that it hates or blames men?

Lol no. They say it all the time everywhere, as I pointed out in the 1848 declaration, and the article I linked. They just don't like giving it away immediately to critics. Gives people like you some weak degree of plausible deniability.


&gt;How is externalising and internalising gender norms generated by a particular societal structure equal to hating or blame men?

It's specifically that only women ""internalize"" sexism, while men externalize it. Men are actors, women are objects. Men create ""sexism"", women recieve it. 

&gt;Most importantly, the section you've quoted there makes it abundantly and explicitly clear that the problem is not with men, but with ""sexist beliefs and institutions"". 

Again, if women cannot be blamed, who can? ""sexist beliefs and institutions"" is a copout. Nowhere does it say: be careful not to blame men.

&gt;I don't think reading comprehension is one of your strengths, is it?

Is that all you have to say to the explicit quotes blaming men that I gave? "

MasterDignam,Fitness,1389837436.0,"There is some good advice above, but here's some from me: don't get discouraged. The first few times doing complex motions is always a mess - squats and deadlifts are complex motions that use a bunch of stabilizing muscles, and you've probably yet to really test them in your life. Keep at it, and keep videotaping yourself - though ""reading the books"" may work, there's nothing like being under/over a bar - at that point, everyone thinks they have perfect form. Here is some other things that might make it easier for you...

- put some weight on the bar on the squats and deadlifts. This seems counter intuitive, but an empty bar deadlift is nothing like a weighted one. Even if you've never lifted before, you will be able to lift some amount of weight. The problem with empty bar is that it gives you too much room to deviate from the most efficient bar path - straight up and down.
- on squats and deadlifts, curl your toes. As has been mentioned, you are leaning forward too much. Curling your toes will force you to sit back on your heels. After you've been lifting a while, you can stop this, but it's a good beginner trick.
- imagine you're a girl trying to get some guys attention. Tits out, ass out! It sounds funny but this is the best posture to have for squats and deads - chest far out, and ass sticking back. I can't stress this enough, it has to be your #1 rule. Every time you set up for a lift, think, ""Tits out? Ass out?"" After every rep, ""Tits out? Ass out?"" Eventually it will be second nature, but you have to drill it now. This will help with your semi-rounded back on deadlift.

Good luck man!"

HappyGerbil88,MensRights,1389838123.0,"A few reasons. First, adult women outnumber adult men, period. So we would expect poor women to outnumber poor men. In addition, a lot of poor men end up in prison, and I don't think prisoners are counted in poverty statistics. So that will count for a lot of the difference as well. Another significant factor, women are more likely to be single mothers, largely due to the greater choices women have regarding reproduction and custody. A family of 2 (or 3 or 4) has a higher threshold for poverty than a single person. Let's say a father of two but without custody earns $18k a year, and the mother has custody and also earns $18k. She's living in poverty, he is not. Child support and alimony are not deducted from the man's earnings (they are often, but not always, added to the woman's income though). So a man who earns $18k/year, and pays $8k in child support and alimony, really only makes $10k, but poverty statistics still count it as $18k. I'm not sure how government assistance and charity counts towards poverty, but women receive more of that than men. 

Finally, there's the ability to earn money. The best jobs for people without skill or education are typically physically demanding; coal miner, construction worker, etc. A male high school dropout is going to be able to get higher paying jobs than a female high school dropout, especially if she's getting pregnant and raising kids."

When cpu chip architecture get to be good enough and cheap enough to not need a dedicated gpu card then apu's will be the further.  For now they are a good solution to fill a niche.  My laptop has an apu and it takes anything I give it.   It may not be the best graphic quality but it runs anything in my steam library.  For my laptop I needed something cheap and portable to run my library and I went with an apu.  They will only get better with time, but for now having an non integrated gpu card is the way to go. "

Erin Pizzey founded the first shelter for abused women in the world, and was one of the pioneers in the field of research on domestic violence. Feminists obviously supported her early work... but then her research showed that women abused men about as often as men abused women, and Pizzey started to try raising awareness for male victims of abuse. Feminists did not like that, at all. She was heavily criticized by feminists, met protests wherever she went, and she and her family were subjected to death threats from radfems. Her dog was shot (contrary to some reports, the dog survived), and eventually she fled the country (she has since returned to England).

They have both done AMAs as well.

If you exit 5 points Marta station on the west [Forsyth Street] side, it will be in front of you and to the left, on the corner of Alabama Street and Forsyth Street. It seems like it would face the right way on the opposite side to see Philips Arena.

It's been a while since I was down that way, but last I was there I saw some people climb up onto a ledge and then into an open window of the building on that corner, in broad day light no less. It seemed like a fairly easy task to climb in with the angle of the street there."

But, if you were to help them, the effort/cost to you would be minimal, and the benefit for them would be immense.

So every time someone chooses not to help, I see an opportunity wasted for the collective contentment of humanity to be increased.

All because of pride. Because you feel they don't deserve it, you'll deny them happiness. The net happiness of our species suffers, because most people want to believe they live in a just world. It's selfish in my eyes, and cruel to have the power to ease suffering, yet willingly choose to withhold it.

Not because it would burden you, but because you've decided that their suffering is just. Desiring for another person to continue to suffer? That's villainous."

Definitely don't do the ring! In February some of the roads still have icing, very dangerous and risky, especially if you don't have lots of experience, plus I think all the rentals have manual shifting which makes things lot harder for many people.

So to answer your questions.

* 1. It's not really hard, you might not even be driving in snow at all, the icing on the roads is a bigger issue. Just be very careful and don't go on paths which are made for 4X4. Just be careful and have the [112 Iceland](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.stokkur.savage.android&amp;hl=en) installed. It's a emergency app if you get lost or in serious danger.
* 2. I'd stay in the South region but in one day it can be limited how much you can actually do, I'd try to catch at least one hot pool ([Reykjadalur](http://www.adventures.is/Iceland/Hiking/HotSpringHunt/) or [Seljavallalaug](http://www.enjoyiceland.is/Places/all_regions/Attractions/Hot_Springs/57/default.aspx) ) and perhaps [Skaftafell National Park](http://www.vatnajokulsthjodgardur.is/thjodgardurinn/afangastadir/skaftafell/) - this is something that you cannot do in just one day, 2-4 days would be recommended. If you need to borrow a tent and sleeping bags I might be able to help you out.

Like I've mentioned to couple of other folks around the post, if you send me a PM I could could send you my personal phone, mail and location if you want a contact me while you're here, I'd love to help you out any way I could. ;)"

* teleport to airfield south of the inland sea.
* fly helo along the river west and enter the airfield just west or east of the southeastern base tower. You need to know how to fly helos decently well. Especially low and slow as you approach to land near the two north facing jets, just north of thd runway.
* shoot any guards obviously (if u see a vehicle approach and park in front of the jet its most likely a failed attempt)
* take off and immediately retract landing gear (imperative) and pull all the way up so the jet flies past vertical and is now upside down. You should be heading south at this point and should also  have just dodged the first and only rocket you need worry about. Aim the aircraft nearly directly up and gain as much altitude while putting distance from the base.

* if you are killed on first attempt, call merryweather and order a helicopter pickup. Kill pilot steal copter and repeat steps.

* if you fail second attempt, teleport back to airfield and repeat all steps.

Renner1,confession,1389841596.0,"Just going to follow up on this thread once more.

&gt; One of the links on the sidebar (unless they took it down) said that women all have a developmental disability that prevents them from fully maturing mentally, and they all have somewhat childlike brains. 

I actually haven't taken a look at the sidebar, but if this thing did exist I would think they would take it down, considering all the accusations they get off the bat.

I've been judging the sub based off of the comments I've read on different posts, and to be honest I'm not seeing a whole lot of irrational-level hostility. They don't like third wave feminism, that's for sure-- but I can understand on that one definitely.

&gt; I've never watched her show, but I've seen a few clips. I didn't like what I saw. I don't like how it makes women seem immature and weak.

Denham is stupid-level third wave, you realise? Really obstinately ""body positive"" as well.

So you're saying that the reality of women having the chance of being immature and weak, and the show reflecting that, is this awful, terrible thing?

That's sort of nonsensical, don't you think? 

&gt; To me, that's what feminism is about. Being strong and respecting yourself. 

And there are plenty of women who don't at all identify as feminists, or at the least don't buy into second and third wave ideology, who feel the same and behave the same way.

There are plenty of feminists who act and behave in ways that make it seem as though they have no self-respect, and yet they demand respect in spades.

&gt; I personally don't think there's anything feminist about her show.

Again, she's stupidly third wave and would disagree, I can imagine.

&gt; I think they hated society, for expecting them to fulfill roles they were unhappy with.

Again, the second wave created the archetype of the ""man-hating feminist"".

These are the women who said that men go around thinking about rape and that men effectively use rape to try and keep women ""down"", and that sex with men is rape.

&gt; At that time, society was oppressive to women, and there was a conspiracy to keep women down.

I disagree. I think that sounds vastly overgeneralizing, is historically inaccurate, and almost conspiratorial.

&gt; . Did you know that some TV shows in the 1950s actually received government funding, if they would continue to show ""traditional roles"" of men and women?

TV showed a lot of things in the 1950s it doesn't show now-- at least not in the same form, in terms of xenophobia, shoddy/misleading news standards, or jingoism.

What it didn't espouse was some sinister desire to oppress women and turn them into an underclass.

&gt; I don't believe 100% of societies were oppressive to women. But about 90% of the ones studied in a World History class were. 

""Patriarchal"" doesn't inherently mean oppressive to women. You could argue that most societies placed a lot of value on class and social hierarchy to an excessive degree, in some cases-- but this was something that transcended the sexes.

&gt; It was definitely the majority idea at that time. Sexism in the 1950s was not a ""fringe movement"". 

I don't think so. You could say that gender roles were seen more so as natural, but the gender role isn't rooted in ""how can we be unfair or oppressive"", and when people talk of ""gender roles"" during this time they always cite the most conservative parts of the USA as and example. 

Didn't set the precedent for the world."

futurecrazycatlady,relationships,1389841735.0,"I wouldn't give up just yet. I mean before the pregnancy you and her where a 'young' couple, perhaps she wasn't comfortable enough yet to explore. 

The problem for you now is that it could take quite some time before you two go back to normal again. Usually birth and the sleepless nights that come from having a baby aren't the most adventurous times for couples. So it will perhaps take even a whole other year for you can judge if it's overall compatibility or the circumstances.  

Don't beat yourself up too much for wondering how it could have been with someone else. Most people do that at times, we're programmed to be curious about the unknown. For instance, people that didn't stay with their first love, might wonder how it could have been if that worked out. 

The best advice I can give you is to be patient, you're young, and you can always, always leave if you really can't handle it, but going back is usually not an option. "

Feferi is dead. There really isn't much else to say on the matter.

You know. I think we all need to appreciate that (besides Aradia MAYBE) Dave is a fucking ACE at time travel. The only one in Homestuck. Think about that, out of all the characters past and future he is pretty much the only one who can do it flawlessly. [It's really interesting considering the fact that he's now outright refusing to time travel at all and his whole hero complex.](/spoiler)

&gt;[GG: you cant play in lava, its no fun](/gg)

&gt;[GG: you can only die in lava](/gg)

[Let us take the time to remeber forward how we all freaked out about Jade heading to the lava pond. Thankfully she only got KO'ed.... And then the thing that happened next happened ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)](/spoiler)

&gt;[GG: and not robots???](/gg)

I fucking love this joke

&gt;[TG: by now im pretty used to having my intuition woven into the fabric of the alpha timeline](/tg)

To reiterate my point

[STEP OFF.](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/03034.gif)

&gt;[TT: It is nearly twice the mass of our universe.](/tt)

&gt;[TG: ok thats pretty fucking big](/tg)

&gt;[TG: see how important that contextualization was now i know how fucking impressed i should be](/tg)

&gt;[TG: i mean hopy shit thats huge ](/tg)

That sun, by which I do mean the [.](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/greenmotherfuckingsun.gif) IS FUCKING HUGE now that I think about it. [I feel like the scenes before, during, and after Cascade don't do it justice because you can see it's curvature. No. It's the MOTHERFUCKING GREEN SUN. That shit should be flat beyond any possible vision if you're that close to it. And during the Strider's journey through the Furthest Ring IT SHOULD STAY THAT BIG! Besides that I'd also like to endorse BKEW Black Hole Theory. To be honest, it is my OTE (One True Ending)](/spoiler)

&gt;[TT: It's a bomb.](/tt)

My perspective of things was competely blown away by this statement. [Is it safe to assume that The Tumor a convienient result of Karkat/Gamzee giving the universe cancer? No, come to think of it, that doesn't make sense considering that the Incipishpere exists outside the universe. LE has yet to directly enter Universe B so we can throw out the possibility of the session glitch. Any theories?](/spoiler)

[Actually, I think I'll take the time here to debunk the baseline of weird plot shit for all of Homestuck, the sessions and the horrorterrors. I am fairly sure they were not created by Lord English. To create something that superoverpowering I feel is beyond the reach of weird time shit as well, so it's probably not a self-fufilling clusterfuck. My bet is that it has something to do with the transparent SBurb logo, assuming it isn't part of the sessions itself. It is entirely possible it had something to do with its creation, something meta perhaps even? I'm going to interject a fan theory here and say Hussie created it somehow but it turned out to be too powerful for him to control and now he has to live by it's rules and tries his hardest to avoid it's influence i.e. Living in some separate universe in fear of LE who he indirectly created. Would make for an interesting backstory, don't you think?](/spoiler) Fuck me, I'm not BKEW.

&gt;[TT: It's a man who exists in another universe.](/tt)

&gt;[TT: He wants to die. ](/tt)

So that's what he said, then.

&gt;[TT: As a first guardian, he's completely indestructible. ](/tt)

[Wait, wait, wait. Hold up, how the hell DID Scratch die? AH sorta tusseled him up and he went limp. Did he even actually die? Either one of two things happened: 1. Scratch lied, unlikely or maybe even a misstep in writing. 2. Somehow, Hussie killed him. Both are equally disturbing.](/spoiler)

Cyberboss_JHCB,homestuck,1389843140.0,"Favorite Flashes:

&gt;[1](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006009). [[S] Cascade: Can it really be beaten? All that work and creativity coming together? If it can, I will proudly crown Andrew Hussie the greatest artist of all time!](/spoiler)

&gt;[2](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004827). [S] Jade: Enter: Such chills, such epicness, it wasn't easy for number 1 to beat this.

&gt;[3](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003840). [S] Descend: I find it funny this made it this high. I think this was the moment the Homestuck really grabbed me. Until now, I expected them to gradually complete the game and come together at a final fight against the black king, following a set storyline of something like say Avatar: The Last Airbender. This showed to me that the story in itself was not going to follow it's own rules and anything could happen.

&gt;[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007138)/[4](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007152). [[S] Dirk: Synchronize\Unite (Counts as one): I love the way Hussie is able to make these connections and let everything flow together, it's a really amazing thing](/spoiler)

&gt;[5](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003049). [S] Enter: OK I'll admit when I first read the story I wasn't really involved in it (I skipped the Midnight Crew Intermission :$). This finally got me to say, huh this looks like it could be pretty interesting.

&gt;[6](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006290). [[S] END OF ACT 6 INTERMISSION 1: I love this one because it's pretty much foreshadowing Act 6 and in a really beautiful way.](/spoiler)

&gt;[7](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007161). [[S] Caliborn: Enter.: And the big bad wolf is revealed. This was a really sad moment for me, mainly because this is the planet from [S] Roxy: Sleepwalk and, to me, it has the same connotations as burning a book. That instantly made me hate LE. Well played, Hussie, well played.](/spoiler)

&gt;[8](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004987). [[S] JOHN. RISE UP.: One of the prettiest songs I've heard in Homestuck, this flash really evokes emotion in you.](/spoiler)

&gt;[10](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004888). [S] ==&gt;: The Frost and Frogs introduction. It's just beautiful.

&gt;[11](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007338). [[S] ACT 6 ACT 4: Another storyteller flash. This one pretty much sums up all of the B2 kid's session in just a few minutes. And only using imagery. I find it fascinating how artists are able to do this sort of thing.](/spoiler)

&gt;[12](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002926). [S] Jade: Dream up extra arms and play advanced bass solo.: This one pretty much made me remeber that these kids are into something really big.

&gt;[13](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006472). [[S] Prince of Heart: Rise up.: Really good animation in this one, made me realize how much Hussie's skill has been improving over the past few years.](/spoiler)

&gt;[15](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003701). [S] WV?: Rise up.: We finally get to see the battlefield and the big war that's happening. A really good worldbuilder flash.

&gt;[16](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003500). [S] John: Reunite with your loving wife and daughter.: Does this really need an explaination? HOW DO I LIIIIVE WITHOUT YOUUUU???

And no it's not something you can do yourself. Especially with limited knowledge of cars. Let a professional do it. In most cases the ECM isn't exactly plug and play. It requires an update and reflash. Similar to reformatting a PC harddrive. It can only be done with specific equipment &amp; programs dedicated to reflashing vehicle ECMs.

Just out of curiosity. What actuator did they say you needed to replace?

For your future reference, a lot of time when you have a lot of codes like that all at the same time, it's usually an ECM problem. All the codes you posted are for cylinder misfires and a Variable Valve Timing code. It's usually pretty unusual for that many cylinders to all start misfiring at once without something electrical like the ECM being messed up.

Another user in a fit check I posted recommended starting at a 28 band instead of 30, and using an extender for comfort until the elastic in the bra naturally begins to loosen on its own.

billweasley,WTF,1389843890.0,"Our current system is terrible but the new system is not going to be any better. Our government is already in crippling debt and can't afford to support an entire healthcare system like this. One of the ways they plan to do this is by cutting back physicians wages. Medical school students average $200,000 in debt after graduating and don't make enough money to even begin to pay it back until ~6 years after graduating. When the pay for physicians drops, they will be in debt for a significantly longer amount of time. This will turn people away from going into medicine at a time when we need roughly 40,000 new primary care physicians to account for the influx of patients that will arrive with the new health care plan. Obviously the current system is awful, but Obamacare will collapse under its own weight in less than 10 years. Neither is a long-term solution for healthcare."

2. Rotate hand 90 degrees to cover mouth with palm touching the mouth.
3. Maintain the handshape and location from step 2, but move the hand away from yourself and towards the other person.

""Please"" is signed much like ""thank you"". In fact, it is signed as follows:

1. Perform step 1 from ""Thank you"".
2. Perform step 2 from ""thank you"".
3. Return hands to position from step 1, but with palms facing down.

""Sorry"" is another idiom, signed as ""HEART-HIT-HURT"". It is signed:

1. Perform steps 1 and 2 from ""thank you"".
2. Extend dominant hand away from body and form a fist.
3. Bring fist back to rest on nondominant hand while making a ""hurt"" face (it should look like you are punching your heart).

The blockchain is essentially a big history of bitcoin, the first block was mined by the founder of current bitcoin chain and everyone else mining Bitcoins is adding to that blockchain.

If someone has a majority of the processing power on the chain they can basically ""agree"" that several different ""spends"" were spent at the same time, because bitcoin operates on consensus that mean the network would accept it as valid. This is a known problem of the bitcoin network and the only defense anyone has come up with is ""it's too expensive to get that much processing power"""

Also Crimson got off requiem *twice*.  They were stationed on the Infinity the first time it crashed on requiem.  And they survived the Didact.  And an assualt on earth.

Also: Osman didn't have her skeleton replaced.  She never got any of the skeletal augments, and was pulled from the program before then.

Further, the MK V [b] armor is inferior to the MK V production variant given to the SIIs because it was privately manufactured outside of Halsey's design specs for SPECWAR Group Three.

And just to really hammer in the nail:

Kurt was killed by an energy sward.  Malcolm died from a fall to earth.  Joshua and Vinh died of bombs inferior to those of the covenant and Li died in slipspace.  Oh, and Spartan Red Team was killed falling to Reach entirely.  So if you *really* want to use Chief as the yardstick of what it means to be a spartan then not even Kurt-I-kill-hunters-with-my-bare-hands-0-motherfucking-51 is a Spartan by that measuring tool.  In fact, Chief himself isn't even a spartan, since none of his success would have been possible without Cortana.  He would have died on Reach with the rest of them.

Meanwhile, if you exclude Chief from the measuring stick then everything that the Spartan IIs have done, the Spartan IVs have done with *fewer* casualties.  Funny what technological and medical progress can do."

I don't know about any website, but I can tell you that: It's not what you have, it's how you use it. Languages are more than just semantics and syntax, support, libraries and other factors go into shaping and purposing it for some particular task. Python is a very clever language and allows you to prototype a lot of complex aspects very quickly but it doesn't mean it's good for video editing -- in fact if anything, major video editing software are written in C++.

Python is also quite popular in web development circles thanks to Google's popularization of it."

High School again.. Cafeteria bathroom someone had smeared shit all over the walls.. on the floor in the sink. Apparently.. kid has horrible mushy poo.. shits his jeans.. tries to take a shit on the toilet (already covered in shit..) shit drops on floor.. toilet seat etc.. tries to clean shit off of pants by smearing it on the walls.. does not work.. goes to sink and proceeds to trail shit everywhere and tries to wash it in there. Did not work either.. ends up throwing his pants and boxers off the side of the building.. fails and lands in a tree (school was built on a ridge with stairs leading down to our field at the bottom of the ridge) For the rest of the year.

&gt;the knowledge

What knowledge, how to operate all alien firearms and vehicles?  Because SIVs can do that.  They also understand intergalactic politics well enough to not automatically try capping any elite they see in the face.

&gt;the discipline

You mean like working well in teams, listening to team mates while still maintaining rank orginization, effectively using the skills of all squadmates to their fullest and the like?  Because the Spartan IVs have all been shown to do that.  Even Halsey thinks some of the IVs are in keeping with her vision of the Spartan program.  And before you counter with ""well DeMarco's a fucknut"" because he very much is, you'll note that A) he's an effective leader in combat and B) his personality is very much like some of the Spartan IIs, such as Solomon.

Or did you mean the ability to operate under heavy fire, decisively and effectively counter threats while minimizing incoming losses, and doing so without getting killed?  Because last I checked they do that too, see Thorne, Palmer, Madsen, Grant, and that's not even beginning to touch on squads like Shadow Team that do things solo that Noble Team (which, you may recall, had a spartan II) needed a slipspace bomb to do."

We weren't there, and OP doesn't seem to know much about the situation so he's choosing to err on the side of ""I got taken"" based on past experiences.

Here's my summation of what happened: The engine was knocking, probably rod knock or a spun bearing. Engine was DOA when he made it to the shop. He never says how many miles were on the motor or if he took general care of it.

Rather than rebuild the motor, the shop told them they could get him a used one. Knowing what I know about replacing motors, transmissions, and variety of other things, a lot of times when you get something like this it's on a 'core exchange basis'. So when OP picked up his car and asked to see the old motor, it was already gone on core exchange. And this is what the shop told him.

But since OP saw other motors lying around, possibly because the shop does a lot of engine swaps and they have other engines that *weren't* needed for a core, he thinks he got fucked.

So far OP is just using his own ignorance on dealing with the situation and failing to get more info to blame the shop."

etgggg,CFB,1389846337.0,"No its so much more complex than that. For starters its a private school,so not only is it smaller but a lot of students coming in have no ties to the athletics to begin with. Vanderbilt had 788 freshman or roughly 48 percent from the state of Tennessee in the most recent freshman class, as opposed to a school like UGA that admitted over 8000 Georgia residents, 86% of the class, more than all of Vandy's undergraduates and 3 times as much as all of Vandy's Tennessee residents. Plus most of the good football programs are gigantic state schools with 10's of thousands of students to draw from, Vandy has 6800 undergrad students and a 40,000 seat stadium, so even if every single student showed up that would be less than 20 percent of the stadium and you would have to get 33,000 people to come on their own volition, good luck. 2nd being in downtown Nashville hurts a ton, because unlike a small college town, Vanderbilt gets completely engulfed by the city and the professional teams, so they're easy to ignore. I went to school most of my life literally right next to Vanderbilt, and the amount of people I know who support Vandy is in the single digits and the amount pf UT fans was even higher. Imagine growing up in Tuscaloosa and knowing 7 Alabama fans but loads of Auburn fans thats preposterous. Then you throw in being atrocious for 70 years and thats just the icing on the cake. There's no history, there is very little influence on the area surrounding it, a relatively  small student body, and worst of all very few people grow up Vandy fans. Most schools have these huge fan bases that never even attend the schools, in fact its their bread and butter, finding 60,000 alumni would be tough, but they have fans who just grow up liking them and support them without any real affiliation to the school , Vandy fans like that are far and few between."

Renner1,confession,1389846398.0,"&gt; I know they are commonly considered the worst of all the subreddits on Reddit.

By who, third wave feminists? 

All I'm saying is that I read the comments on a few pages and there wasn't anything insane or ridiculously rude or anything like that.

I don't at all consider myself an adherent to red pillism or anything like that, I jus think that a lot of the most aggressive, most hysterical third wave feminists are up in arms about it because it's distinctly anti-third wave feminist.

I have problems myself with some of the red pillers in regard to geo-political ignorance/actively making things up because they don't know what they're talking about, but third wave feminists are no strangers to that sort of thing.

&gt; I also support body-positive attitudes. If she or anyone else chooses to appear nude on camera, that's their choice. And people don't complain when conventionally attractive people do it, so people shouldn't complain when someone of a different body type chooses to do it. 

If you put your unfit self on the television, you also can't complain if people don't understand your flaunting your nudeness around.

I bet if Denham was a dumpy, plain-looking man, you'd be less receptive to the ""body positivity"" thing. Which would make sense, I will say outright.

&gt; I don't like how they act immature and weak all the time, and Dunham claims it's a feminist TV show, and represents an entire generation. I don't think it's right of her to make a show with seriously flawed characters (and not in an anti-hero type of way, they are just really dumb characters), and claim that represents all women. 

Only an idiot would take away from the show ""these characters define women of today in all aspects!""

It's stupid feminist posturing-- I do admit I have met women who are as indecisive and idiotic and who believe they're owed something because of their sex, but I certainly don't think that they represent any large number of women.

I also think that the worst sorts of third wave feminists don't represent a whole lot of women, despite what they like to claim.

&gt; I can see why she considers her show feminist, and it's not completely anti-feminist. I just think she could have made some stronger characters.

A wholly crap show, with stupid characters and the lead actress is no better. Just gives the whiniest and the ones who want to be in a ""gender war"" perpetually more things  to complain about, especially when the show is officially criticized.

&gt;  You don't think Western culture in the 1950s, especially in the US, was at all oppressive?

Parts of it, I suppose, depending on a plethora of factors and circumstances. 

But in general? No. The entire world was, despite the cold war narrative, in a very heterogeneous phase and changing rapidly, for one thing.

&gt; Society in the 1950s was probably not a fun place to be unless you were a white male. This is the same society that had forced racial segregation.

I'm sorry, but this just sounds like a soundbite. 

There were plenty of white males who had it good or very good, but even more that were in the shit, so to speak. 

Segregation wasn't a universal thing in the states, either.

But all in all, I think living standards and places in society for people of any sort varied largely depending on what your geographical position was and what your lifestyle was like in terms of education and finances.

&gt; They weren't going to be too obvious about it, but they definitely portrayed women in subservient roles. 

To a certain extent, possibly. But it wasn't as though they were saying ""women are only good for x, y, and z"" or something like that.

&gt; But a patriarchal society is, by definition, one ruled by men. 

Does male rule  automatically mean female degradation and oppression? I don't think so.

Take into consideration that the ""patriarchal"" society came into existence out of simple necessity in terms of societal progression and adaption as opposed to somehow having the desire to piss on the female."

But you're right. I should have waited an hour for a security guard to walk me to my car. I should have called a male friend to walk me to my car.

And an aside: My aunty told me how village women in India would often get UTIs because they would hold their pee in at night so they wouldn't be sexually assaulted in the fields at night. Just them being ""safe"". "

cptn_garlock,TrueAnime,1389846802.0,"**Nagi no Asukara 14** came back with a pulse-pounding time-skip. Different PoV, some new characters, and a lot of reminiscing, ultimately leading to the return of Hikari. Frankly, I'm still amazed at how much they manage to pack into a single episode. Seriously, this show is great, and any reservations I had about Okada making the timeskip are wiped clean. 

**Golden Time 13** went the opposite direction. It's official, we've jumped the shark so hard. We literally could've ended the show on a resolved note at the halfway mark. There was literally no use for this drama. I seriously have no idea why I watch this. At this point, it's not even a directing issue anymore (although that is still there) - it's an issue with the plot itself, which is purely Takemiya's handiwork.

**Log Horizon 15** finally hands us some conflict to begin chewing on. Coupled with the knowledge that death may delete parts of their memory, and the fact that the scrub squad and the training camp may be in real danger from Murlocs, it looks like the pace will be accelerating! All I can say is ""thank god no more SoL."" Looks like we got some magical warfare on our hands, boys! 

**Space Dandy 02** was more the same, although the little story of the ramen vendor was nice (if too short.) Here's hoping Scarlet makes a comeback at some point because *dayyuuuum dat booty.*

**Chuunibyou Ren 02** was...good? Actually, yeah, good! I was expecting nothing but plain character-service (and I kinda expect I *will* get nothing but character-service in the future) but Togashi and Rikka actually coming to terms with the fact that they really have no clue what they're doing, and realizing that's okay, is actually a really surprising revelation to have so early in the game. Frankly, I'm kinda impressed. Way to put the pedal to the metal on the romance, KyoAni!

**Nisekoi 01** was exactly as dumb as I expected it to be, but even more tedious because it's in animated form rather than a manga. Which sucks, because this show has got some serious flair behind it. It's straight up Shafty as fuck. It's like when I watched *Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko*, except with an ever dumber plot. 

**Noragami 01-02** is a show that suffers from a lot of the same problems as *Nisekoi* - highly generic plot and characters backed by great art and direction. It makes me think of all that budget and where it could be better used, and I cry a little inside. 

**Wizard Barristers 01** is *another* show that doesn't deserve the kind of budget it has, because fucking hell Cecil is stereotypical and annoying right now. Granted, it's only the first episode, but there's something really wrong when they get *NORIO FUCKING WAKAMOTO* in there, just to play a fucking pervert frog familiar. Goddamit. Seriously, though, this could've been a lot more enjoyable if they'd had Haruka as the newbie, not this overzealous newbie. Also, the implication of Cecil joining the wizards bar to save a family member or a friend gives me flashbacks to *Aria the Scarlet Ammo*, and that's a horrible show to be compared to. Don't fail me, Umetsu...

**Sekai Seifuku 01**...is a show I have no idea what to make of yet. On the one hand, it looks like it might actually have shit to say about the nature of home and stuff but...how do I take world-dominating lolis seriously?

**Tonari no Seku-kun 02** is the best show on television. Fuck you haters. Yokoi is new best girl.

**The Pilot's Love Song 02** was...I dunno, it was okay? It felt like a well-executed version of a tired fantasy romance. I dunno, something about the genericness of it all pulls me out from the good things I'm seeing. 

**Super Sonico: The Animation** is useful for at least one thing - I now have something to point to when I say ""you wanna know what my idea of a 1/10 show is? look at *that* shit."" Also, apparently I get a medal if I finish this thing, and the insane circlejerk in the episode threads almost makes this worth it. *Almost.*"

Tyrion hideous like everyone agrees.


*The perfect or really close cast for me was.

-Sansa

-Arya

-Bran

-Rickon

-Benjen Stark (Holy shit, like they read my mind)

-Eddard Stark (I pictured a little younger, thinner and more pale)

-Jaime

-Viserys (Yep, spot on how I pictured him)

-Walder Frey

-Sam Tarly

*Close one's were

-Stannis (I pictured the hair different, perfect voice)

-Melisandre of Asshai (Pretty damn close)

-Robb and Jon I pictured younger with thicker longer hair, like Ned.

-Catelyn, I kinda pictured her younger and more attractive to me

-Daenerys Targaryen, purple eyes missing

-Roose Bolton, more... vampirish? Facial movements are spot on, but he's missing his longer hair and pink cloak, and just a little off of how I pictured him

-Cersei I kinda picture more.. Seductive? More of a friendly, venomous stab in back type deal. The show she kind of has a bitch face on all the time.

-Robert Baratheon, I dunno, I saw him as a more built guy. A guy that you can tell WAS a great warrior, but got fat.

The ones who are completely different to me are:

-Mance Rayder, C'mon. He was supposed to be a bard, a lean man who looks like he's had fun in his life and has traveled places. Laugh lines and I guess, less I'M GONNA LIKE DA BIGGEST FIYAH DA NORF HAS EVER SEEN type deal.

-Ramsay Snow, I pictured him bigger than Theon, more chubby with pale skin. Ugly wormy lips and cruel, cruel eyes. The show he seems to likeable? I dunno, friends of mine think he's funny and some of them think he's good looking. Dude. He's fucking torturing and raping and flaying people c'mon!

She proceeded to bite it's head off. Not sure if she ate it or spit it out.

 I ended up working at Walmart a few years back and she got hired a while after i did. She seemed more well adjusted than before but still gave off that weird vibe. Also was a lazy worker."

ed8020,IAmA,1389847474.0,"All the intelligence collected in the world means NOTHING if you're not willing to act on it. Regular briefings on the activities of AQ all the way back to the Clinton administration were completely dismissed, which ALLOWED the events of 9/11 to take place. And no, I'm not saying they did it on purpose. The only security agency not in operation at that time was DHS. As you say, this has been going on the whole time yet it failed to protect us. The problem is not ""too much security"" but too many security measures that fail to do anything but strip away our freedoms. The founding fathers had CENTURIES of human history to draw on when they came up with the Bill of Rights. And it's a package deal. You can NOT pick and choose which ones to respect.

I don't much care; we're careful and condoms are used.

Unfortunately, to a lot of [stupid] people, being ""sex-positive"" just means that you like to have sex.  I've been with people who made that claim, yet treated me like shit once I did sleep with them -- as though I was somehow less-than because I made the decision to have sex with them without being in a relationship.  I felt no guilt about sleeping with someone ""for fun"" until I started to be treated like crap for doing so, by the people I slept with.  Um, you were there too, dude.

I'm sex-positive, and I enjoy sex, but I personally prefer monogamy.  I think a person should be able to sleep with whomever s/he wants to, provided they're not in a monogamous relationship with someone else in which sleeping around hasn't been discussed.  I think someone should be allowed to have as many or as few sex partners as s/he chooses, and it doesn't bother me a whit either way.

The creeps are already pushing down the tower, so I call for everyone to run him down and grab another kill. The noobgreed was strong with me then.

We're at the mid base entrance and WD is running to escape in through the top entrance. We fail to notice Rubick sitting at the inside edge of the wall. He casts a stolen Chain Frost at us. By the time we realize what's happened, we're all down to 1/2 health from about 7/8, each, and WD hits us with his cask. There's nothing else around, so the two spells ping-pong merrily between us and Rubick picks up a triple kill.

He types something Russian.

We all agree that, despite that Rubick's team going on to lose, that was *the* play of the game."

brightsizedlife,AskNYC,1389848766.0,"1-  Cost of living varies. I live comfortably as a twenty something making 50k. I have friends that are making 35k and they make it work without being completely antisocial - for which I commend them.

Depending on the area, what amenities you want and how many people you want to live with you should expect your rent to be anywhere between $700 and $1500. It varies a lot but I'd say $700 is pretty much the bottom for a decent place. 

2- There are tons of young and active communities so you'll have to narrow it down more. Depends on what nightlife you want and what type of ""young actives"" you like. Parts of Brooklyn are the most vibrant right now with a lot of ""hipster"" culture. There's also a lot of non hipster culture there too. Some places off the top of my head are - 

* Manhattan: East Village, Lower East Side, Greenwich village (these are obvi) - gonna be more expensive but good nightlives and active communities. Upper west side is a bit less ""hip"" but still young - more Jewish and ""bro""ey types. Upper East Side is more families oriented so things are nice there but not so young. I've heard good things about Washington Heights but it's really far up there.

* Queens: Astoria (where I live) - very safe and getting younger and hipper. Lots of amazing food and the rent is very reasonable for how close I am to Manhattan (20 min). Long Island City is also very up and coming - probably more so than Astoria.

* Brooklyn: Williamsburg and Greenpoint are probably the ""hippest"" and ""hipsterest"" areas these days. Bushwick and Bed-Stuy are offshoots but aren't the safest. I really like Park Slope - It's kind of known for the ""young, hip families"" but to me it's got a good mix of young and hip but also ""we've got real jobs"". Prospect Heights is really nice but older. Fort Greene kind of has the same rep as Park Slope

3- Lots of rock climbers. I've heard about a few places in Brooklyn that are usually very packed. I know there's a new facility somewhere in BK.

4- I have Timewarner standard cable internet. About $50 for just DSL (no tv) that I split with my two roommates. Speed is awesome for me. Usually get 1-1.5Mbps down. Fios is available in places.

5- Yes, finding roommates on Craigslist is completely normal. I've done it for all of my roommates. Just don't do anything you're not comfortable with and make sure there's a clear lease or sublease anytime you're moving somewhere. Most people expect at least first and last month's rent. http://www.listingsproject.com/ is actually a great site and you can subscribe to her list. She finds good places mostly in BK that aren't too crazy priced. Roommates are basically vetted by her and it's all free.

I moved here about a year and a half ago from out of state knowing nothing about NYC's hoods or renting and I'm doing fine. If you have any questions about getting around or finding an apartment PM me."

The $35 one is not as good and isn't a deal I'd personally take, but OP didn't necessarily get hosed either. If nothing else, it came with a first-party controller and an array of interesting paperwork. "

The most important ones to me are eating well, which means making sure you get your fruits and veggies and plenty to drink (tea and coffee count too towards 2 liters a day) and exercise.
Though it can help to look fabulous too, it's mainly meant to have your body release all those lovely chemicals that will make you feel good.

Also focus on all the things that are great about yourself, having a journal just to write down all the things that made you proud can help you on the days that you are feeling down. Don't completely ignore the bad days though. You need to know what brings you down in order to process and change it. But stay nice to yourself, if you notice you're getting to strict for yourself, try and ask yourself if you'd ever think that about a friend... If you don't no one else is thinking that about you either!

If you don't feel like your doing something worthwhile, change that! Learn a new skill or volunteer somewhere.

Now, the next part is a bit meh, because it's all appearance and a bit superficial. But hey, every bit helps.

Learn which colors suit you, for clothes, make-up and hair color and work with them. The great thing about this is, if you stay in the same tones basically everything in you wardrobe will match, so it's much less of a hassle getting dressed.

You could start simple, by just picking a few outfits that make you feel great and just recycling those, while ignoring all the items that just don't work for you at the moment.

There are some great subreddits that can help with all the things like make-up, hair and style. Just try to see if there's something out there that works for you.

Some people are happiest wrestling in the mud with a pack of dogs, others are happy when they are the only ones who know they are wearing sexy lingerie and are wearing killer heels, just try all the options and try to remember which things made you feel good!

Also, masturbate, knowing your own body tip to toe helps a lot with the feeling at home in it part.

Micca's MB42x 

http://www.amazon.com/Micca-MB42X-Bookshelf-Speakers-Tweeter/dp/B00E7H8GG2

These speakers come with a crossover installed, allows for audio to go the the correct part of the speaker. Which means that highs are crisp, and lows aren't muddy. These speakers are near audiophile level and are super easy on the ears. They have a beautiful soundscape, I can find instruments and hear things I didn't know existed before hand. I prefer them to my century jbl100's.

I had the same discussion over charging for parking spaces. If they were all free, people would pay for spots with their time - spending 30 minutes trying to find somewhere to park, never knowing when to give up. Monetary pricing is simply more efficient.

Starfleet's primary function is exploration, followed by things like diplomacy and humanitarian work. When Starfleet vessels are involved in combat, they're never the aggressor (save for exceptions like Maxwell), and even in combat do not fight like a military, seeking victory. They seek peaceful coexistence and diplomatic solutions, even when frankly they seem like hopeless optimism. 

Starfleet has more in common with NASA than it does the Navy. I'd be a little concerned if NASA started developing technology to make stealth warplanes. "

gooeyfishus,AppalachianTrail,1389850952.0,"The AT is in no way ""uniform climate wise"". You hike in everything from sub-tropical rainforest to alpine to pine forest to soft woods. You get cold, snow, ice, rain, wind, extreme heat, bugs. There is nothing ""uniform"" about the AT. 

The AT is a social trail. There are far more people then either other trail. There is more of a party atmosphere for the bottom half of the AT going north, then on other trails.

The important thing for you OP is that you're graduating in May this year. That changes your options. If you go northbound on the PCT or CDT you'll be encountering far more extreme weather at the end of your hike, possibly life threatening by the end. Heavy snows can come early, and cause you to not finish or be pushed off trail for an extended period of time (this is all dependent on how fast you hike, but average hikers find starting in may to be a challenge). On the AT, the ending mountain of Katahdin closes to camping on Oct 15, complicating your destination.

Going southbound though gives you more options. you can start in the north and hike towards the southern terminus. Be aware though that this means you'll be hiking with less people - on something like the CDT you may not see anyone for extremely long stretches of time - same with the PCT. On the AT you'll see more people, but it will be far less people hiking in your direction that you'd see otherwise. 

Whats the best answer for you? That's up to you. Here I've gone and written a novel already. I've done both a Nobo and a Sobo AT hike now, and both are wonderful in different ways. The big thing is money - you'll need at least 3,000 plus gear to complete a thru-hike comfortably in my opinion. If you don't have that right now.. consider waiting a year, putting some money away and doing a little more planning if you want to seriously finish a thru-hike.

kingtigerii,AndroidQuestions,1389851024.0,"SO, update. I went into the Verizon store and checked out all three phones and this is what I found:
1) The MAXX is heavy, but does respond just like the Moto X. It's a Moto X with a big battery that, with some tweaking, should last 48-72 hours. The camera responded a bit slower than the X...not sure why since everything is the same.

2) The G2 is blazingly quick, has an amazing camera and has a beautiful screen. However, I hated the interface and the bloatware that LG has on it. I hate the buttons on the back because I found my fingers getting in the way of the shots. I hated the sheer size of the phone, much too large for my comfort (The MAXX seemed to fit better in the hand).

3) The X...camera is just enough for me. I can edit the shots in Snapseed to boost saturation. There was much more detail than my Razr Maxx. The screen is fantastic! Bright, beautiful color representation that allows me to actually see instagram and in camera photos. The phone felt well in my hand, love the small dimple under the camera where my index finger naturally sits. Phone is much quicker than my Razr. OS is as close as we will get on Verizon to stock android (The MAXX actually got 4.4 a few days ago, so it too is on 4.4 like the X). Motorola's added software compliments the phone, unlike the past models where I found myself saying I'd disable everything because it never works or is pointless. Finally the price...off contract, for the 32gb model, I paid $481 (tax was quite a bit) with free shipping. That's from Motorola directly. I didn;t have to extend a contract or anything like that. (I bought it immediately because I was so in love with it...it is the first Moto Phone I'm really excited about).

Boils down to this:

The MAXX is an X with a huge battery and will feel heavy and is a bit awkward to hold in hand (for me).

The G2 has a nice battery, is super fast and has the best Android camera Verizon has right now.

The X will last you through the day battery wise, has a decent camera, runs damn near stock Android and has many Motorola optimizations that you wish all phones had.

My advice to you is to head into Verizon and take a look. I did and bought my phone.

OH and btw...The X cannot be bought in store, or so the guy said. Nice guy, felt bad for him not getting the commission, but oh well."

Hulk then grabs the hammer and ""picks it up"" during the last panel (this pick) of this issue. Later we find out Thor was really just recalling Mjolnir. When this issue came out I remember it causing kind of a shit storm within some fans. Some said Hulk was worth, most said not.
