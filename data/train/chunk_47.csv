PlushieChomby,relationships,1391053920.0,"Okay, as someone who, at your age, felt the need to move 2,300 miles to another *country* to get away from my ultra conservative, controlling mother, I'll take a stab at giving advice as best as I can. 

First, it's not always going to be this bad. Hopefully you already know that, hopefully you can see a light at the end of the tunnel. You'll get your degree, you'll move out before or after that happens, you'll have your own life and be able to decide who you hang out with and when, what your room looks like, what your *life* looks like. I know it's rough when you're still living under the same roof, particularly when things are unfairly slanted your direction (one brother is abroad and therefore avoids being a focus, one brother just plays a game as long as he wants and is rebelling in his own way, therefore you're left as the main focus for a child in whose life she feels she has an absolute say) but **it won't be like this forever**. You've survived this long; if you choose to stay at home, you can survive a few more years. 

That said, I'd seriously consider looking into renting a place near your school that you feel you *could* afford. You have a job and you balance school; that's great! Only you can determine if the amount you'd need to spend on rent/utilities/modest food would be worth the freedom of not allowing your mom the ability to check up on you and cover your windows with newspaper and foil. If you haven't checked the craigslist for your area yet, you may very well be surprised at how low rent could be for you. Now's a great time to start working on a potential budget for moving out when the day does come, whether it's sooner or later. Just as a fun little exercise for yourself, find the cheapest rent in the most reliable place you could imagine living, make a month's menu and figure out what your groceries would cost, calculate the potential utilities and gas/car payments/insurance/bus fare to get to and from your job and school. If it's feasible where you live, I cannot recommend biking highly enough. No gas costs plus health benefits. Takes a bit more time, but hot damn will you be in better shape to outrun zombies than your peers. :P 

Once you've calculated a fairly accurate picture of what it would cost you to move out, tack on one or two hundred bucks for monthly incidentals and surprises, and make that amount a goal. Look into something you can do on the side to make some extra cash for yourself in your spare time - there are myriads of ways to make money online these days, from transcribing to selling stuff on sites like etsy to mining freakin' doge or bitcoins and selling them for legit cash when you've got enough. You could also look into housesitting, dogwalking, babysitting if you like kids, mowing neighbor's lawns for cash... really whatever you feel would be up your alley. Housesitting would be particularly spectacular if it's feasible in your situation because it would A) be a job that earns you some extra cash and B) be a legitimate reason for you to be out of your mom's reach for pockets of breathing room time. There are sites where you can sign up and make a profile, too, and you can search and see what need for it there is in your area. 

Lastly, while it's hard to put up with a mom who seems to have a stranglehold on your life, things will be different someday. You'll have the opportunity to form a healthier relationship on your own terms, and she can take it or leave it. It sounds like she loves you, even if she *is* overbearing, so she'll likely take it. Mine did, and for crying out loud, she used to make me put my arms all the way over my head when I was trying on shirts in the store because if even a millimeter of my belly showed it meant I couldn't get the shirt because that was immodest. I know all about living under the thumb of an overbearing mother who means well, and please believe me when I say ***it will get better***. 

But likely only after you've moved out. 

I tried to reason every which way with my mom for years throughout my teens, but it's so hard for many parents to hear their teen out and understand you're a real person, separate from them, not an extension of themselves, not a little kid anymore, with a good idea of who you're becoming and what is and isn't going to be acceptable in your own life. Nothing worked because I was still under her roof, and it took turning things on their head by moving out for her to get the picture that I was now an adult capable of making my own life decisions and didn't need her to try to shape my every step in this world. You might be looking at the same thing. 

On the other hand, your parents let you hang out with a lesbian friend, which mine never in a million years would've been cool with back in the day, so maybe they're more reasonable. Maybe you actually *can* sit down with your mom and tell her that while you appreciate all her concern, it's stifling you and you're trying to grow into a beautiful young lady with a strong head on her shoulders who can confidently make good life decisions and stick with them. Maybe you can tell her that while you know she's just doing what she thinks is best for you, that you might not always agree on what *is* best for you, and that you need more leeway than she's giving you, more room to grow, and part of that is not having her know your schedule and make demands on where and when you're doing what. Maybe she'll actually listen and wisely take your side of things into account and back off a bit. 

If she doesn't, or can't, just remember: a few years and you're out of there. Sooner if you can swing it. Until then, stay as sane as possible and respect her without compromising yourself. Best of luck and if you ever need to talk more or vent with someone who went through all of that a decade back, by all means drop me a line and I'll be happy to hear you out. &lt;3 "

BurnOut91,raisedbynarcissists,1391053948.0,"You want to know why you don't feel as though you don't deserve love? It's a lie that's been beaten into your heart and soul for YEARS; so long that it's a lie you've convinced yourself to believe is true.

Let me tell you something. Anyone who ever tells you that you deserve anything less than love and support IS DEAD WRONG. 

Within you lies a beautiful soul, capable of such wondrous love and understanding because of all that you've been through. It's because of the fact that you've been in a living hell that you should fight every step of the way to the love you've been neglected for so long.

You are amazing. Simply by living another day, you prove what strength you have. You have been drained for so long and yet you still go on, showing an endurance many may never know.

The pain is unbearable at times, I bet. I've been there myself. But killing yourself is not the answer. By doing that, you allow this selfish shell of a person's abuse to gain control over the last aspect of free will you have. You have to believe me when I say that getting through this will be the greatest thing you have ever accomplished, and maybe ever will.

Because at the end of it all, when you're free to live your life void of abuse and neglect, you'll know true happiness, and true love. It's okay to have wants, it's normal to have needs. Never forget that.

I sincerely hope you find your way through this. Please try to get help where you can, and know that I, and all of r/raisedbynarcissists, are here for you. In this small little corner of the internet you'll find EIGHTEEN THOUSAND people who know to some extent what you're going through, and who know JUST HOW AMAZING YOU ARE! 

Please, I'm begging you with all my heart, see it through this. Not for my sake, but for yours. And know that we are always here for you.

As cheesy as it sounds, I love you, you darling person. I may never know you, or meet you, but you are a human being, deserving of love simply by being alive. Were I to list all the other reasons as to why you deserve to be loved, this comment would go in to infinity."

When she chewed out Malory at the end of ""El Secuestro,"" she wasn't exactly eloquent, but her anger was really palpable and made the scene funny and fascinating all at once. She had quite a few great moments like that: not feeling weird at all after the ""Swiss Miss"" threesome, counseling Krieger in the pilot, and especially her reaction to Malory's cancer news in ""Stage Two."" Among many others. 

Since S4 though, she's been stuck with much weaker material; which largely consists of her making loud eating noises, saying ""COCAINE"" repeatedly, calling people ""dicknuts"" and being really loud in the hopes that louder = funnier. It's a waste of Amber Nash to be honest. 

I should note, though, that I do love Archer Vice as a whole and this may end up being my favorite season. It's just that so fat, it works well in spite of Pam, instead of her playing a positive role in its success."

Our dedicated team has been working on this game for a little while now, and we'd still like to follow it through for as long as we can. We do love the game and putting out updates for it. That being said, we are *absolutely* open to new content and submissions of ideas, art, characters, etc from our loving fans. Your opinion matters so much to us, since we make the game for you (seriously, I have barely an hour of total playtime logged. If I have free time for sRPG, I'm working behind the scenes to get the game out there. I feel so bad, it really is a great game!) So if you have any ideas or suggestions or mods or whatever, drop either me, /u/SharpEyez, or the whole modmail a line and we'll see what we can do. Remember- no idea is a bad idea!

A lot of games like this one go open source after a few years of being out and regularly updated, so we'll see what happens down the line. We're not closed off to the idea, we just want to see our baby grow and develop properly before we send them off to college to be modded and optimized and ported. *shudders*"

In some cases, it's just a very skilled player. Sometimes, since paladins are built to take on the most enemies, they seem to be killing everything, whereas the other characters are actually the ones weakening them and buffing the pally.

noseonarug17,AskReddit,1391055189.0,"Just because this comment irks me I'm going to run through that list with my own beliefs as a Christian.

- Violence: definitely not. Israel was certainly involved in wars in the Old Testament but there is nothing in the Bible that promotes violence. [Luke 6:29](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:29), [Luke 22:50-52](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A50-52&amp;version=NIV)
- Hatred: Nope. [Mark 12:31](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12:31)

- Rape: Noooooooooope. [Deuteronomy 22:25-26](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22%3A25-26&amp;version=NIV)

- Racism: I think this is sometimes associated with the church, especially in the southern US, but it's certainly not supported by the Bible. There was slavery in the Old Testament but it was more of a sentence paid by criminals or servitude by POWs, and not like the slavery we think of. It is certainly not supported by the Bible; [take your pick of verses](http://www.openbible.info/topics/racism).

- Sexism: I think there are similar ideas about this one and the church.  While the Bible does perhaps support certain gender roles (the easiest to understand and least likely to be misinterpreted passage is probable [Ephesians 5:22-33](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:22-33)), I can't think of anything that promotes inequality. See any of the same verses on racism I linked to above. Even slut shaming is mentioned: [Hosea 4:14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+4%3A14&amp;version=ESV)

- Elitism: Okay, there are a lot of Christians who are TERRIBLE about this. I could go on for a long time about this, but to keep it short, here's [Romans 3:23](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3:23). If that's not enough for you, [here's a hundred more](http://www.openbible.info/topics/is_all_sin_the_same) (I didn't read them all but the first few are certainly relevant).

- Misinformation (false or inaccurate information that is spread unintentionally): Well, that comes down to whether or not you believe what's in the Bible, which is kind of outside the stated parameters of ""no matter what you believe.""

- Disinformation (intentionally false or inaccurate information that is spread deliberately): While certain people, churches, or even entire denominations who may claim to be Christian spread complete lies, I wouldn't call them Christian.

- Cognitive dissonance: I'm not entirely sure where to go with this one because I'm not sure what was meant by it, so I'll leave it alone until it's clear to me what was meant in the context.

OP, do you know what people who are serious about not being friends with other people do? They **fucking stop talking to them**. Stop answering his texts, stop answering his calls, stop hoping he'll change into a person you hope he'll become, stop imagining what it would be like if only he was that guy - **he isn't that guy**. He's not stopping you from moving on with your life, **you're** stopping *yourself* from moving on by allowing him back into your life, even through texts and phone calls. Just not meeting up isn't enough, stop giving him openings and he'll stop trying to create them. He comes back *because* you reply to his texts and because he knows your actions show you haven't been resolute with regards to cutting him out. 

So next time he texts, ignore it. He calls? Ignore it. Leaves a voicemail? Don't return it. Drop him on social media if you have him added anywhere; nothing says ""I'm insincere about not staying friends"" like leaving someone on your facebook/twitter/instagram/whatthefuckever list. See him in public? Turn the other way and leave. Seriously, there's nothing so wrong with his actions that you should be asking is he going to kill me, but there's something wrong with you for continually providing him opportunities to be a part of your life when you say that's not what you want. 

I can't believe I'm telling someone older than me to grow up, but for your own sake, set some boundaries and actually fucking stick to them. It's the only shot at cutting him out and finding happiness without him that you've got. "

predalienmack,ShouldIbuythisgame,1391055510.0,"I'll just address each game that I have experience with individually: 


Morrowind is the best Elder Scrolls game, IMO. I liked the main story, the world, the guild storylines, the expansions, etc. more than either Oblivion or Skyrim. The gameplay is definitely a bit old school and clunky because it is based on dice rolls for each to-hit chance, so it is not for everyone, but Morrowind still provides the deepest RPG experience from an Elder Scrolls or even a Bethesda game to this point. Also, a vast majority of the dialogue is not voiced over, so you have to do much more reading in that game than most gamers would be used to nowadays. 


There's a remake of the game in the engine that Oblivion uses and an in-progress remake in the engine Skyrim uses, so if the gameplay really bothers you, those remakes or in-engine gameplay overhaul mods can satisfy any issues that you have that arise from that aspect of the game. All that said, it's one of the greatest open-world RPGs ever, so I'd highly recommend it, especially if the Game of the Year edition, which includes the Bloodmoon and Tribunal expansion packs (which are top notch expansions that add many hours of quality content and new areas as well), is on sale.

Knights of the Old Republic (or KOTOR as it is usually referred to) is amongst my top three favorite games of all time and in fact, I just started a fresh playthrough today with some mods (since this is my first time playing it on PC). I dunno if I can say enough about how great the game is, especially with how it gave more life and complexity to the Star Wars universe as someone who was a huge fan of the movies as a kid.


The story is incredible and very interesting considering how cliche most stories within the Star Wars universe are (there are still some cliche bits, obviously, but the storyline in KOTOR is definitely more mature and creatively unique than the movies). The characters are varied and interesting, the dialogue and voice acting are top notch, the worlds that you go to all have very interesting side quests and compelling main plots on them, the races that the game introduces at various points are all fascinating...really, this game is close to perfect in many areas, especially for its time (damn, I just realized that it's over ten years old now). There are a few glitches here and there and the gameplay (which is like a simplified version of Dragon Age: Origins's gameplay, if you've played that) is lightly tactics based and is generally a hit or miss for players. I love it, and the cinematic feel of it is a plus in my books. 


You know how Bioware games are structured if you've played through their more recent games (Mass Effect 1, in particular), so if you liked those, you'll probably like KOTOR. I'd highly recommend it, either way, and it's *the* game I'd recommend over almost any other game.


I have never completed System Shock 2. I can see what made it so great and influential for its time and I respect the game for that reason, but it is truly a very dated game. I'm a guy that doesn't prioritize gameplay over story and I really couldn't get more than an hour or two into the game because it just felt so clunky and boring. It truly is the spiritual predecessor to Bioshock, though, so if you want to play a game that in some ways is a clunkier and more dated version of Bioshock, pick it up when it's cheap and give it a try. I definitely jumped once or twice in the short time I played it, so props to the game for being immersive.


I've had other people recommend grabbing Vampire and I will when it goes on sale for cheap. I've heard a lot of great things about it in terms of the options for choice in the story. Since I haven't played it personally, I can't make a recommendation on that one.

TL;DR - Definitely buy Morrowind and KOTOR (especially if you prioritize story and immersiveness over gameplay) and it really depends on how dated of a game you're willing to play when it comes to System Shock 2. I haven't played Vampire: The Masquerad Bloodlines."

Honestly, it sounds to me as though your father is trying to manipulate you into being under his thumb once again. Have considered going NC with a more straightforward approach? I know you've attempted at making sure he doesn't know your information, but have you ever told him (e-mail, letter, or otherwise) that you are entirely done with him being in your life? If not, I would recommend it. 

It seems as though you are looking for some sort of acceptance or love, hoping that things have changed between you and your parents. I can help you with that. It won't ever change. Nothing will ever change with them in your life. Their continued existence as a presence in your life will ALWAYS bring you down. Don't let them have that. 
Don't let them waste your time and energy. 

And don't be upset at yourself for giving in after so long. You're not a narcissist, so it's only natural that you would hope for a healthy relationship with your family. Because that's something that you still have: faith in others.

If you decide to go full NC, inform those who are close to your father with whom you still speak, that any subject matter related to him will not be tolerated.

It's been years, if I'm not mistaken. Things haven't changed, and they won't change. You need to detach from this negative environment entirely and save yourself.

people also said this about wisp. when the 6.78 nerf didn't do enough, they were convinced that unless relocate was nerfed (or his other skills completely trashed), he would remain a top pick.

Sharkictus,TrueChristian,1391056000.0,"I see Romans and 1 John like this...

God is good.

Cold is lack of heat, and evilness (not the actions or adjective, just the concept) is like ...less God...stuff.

All sins on certain level are reduce our connection to God. Any distancing in general is more less spiritual death.

However severity of sins does not actually affect our chances of salvation, since Christ's on the cross over all types of sin except the unforgivable. 

And the Holy Spirit makes us better through sanctification, but we never reach perfection while we live in our normal mortal fleshy lives.

However proof of salvation, is that some sanctification is happening, and you are only struggling with venial, not mortal sins.  

Normal unsaved people don't struggle with feelings of mass rape and genocide everyday, and someone who is saved shouldn't be eithier.

Mortal sins are mostly things you can't really associate with a moment of weak-willedness on a regular basis."

hylandw,DnD,1391056365.0,"Monks and druids foremost, as it's in the base build.

The rest can be roleplayed to work.

Examples.

Fighter - Learn to craft weapons and armour, thus eliminating the need to buy. You are a soldier, fighting for the good of the poor and defenceless.

Paladin - Same as the fighter, but you instead serve your deity, like a badass plate-armoured ass-kicking european monk. Flagellation optional.

Wizard - You learn from borrowed books and use reagents you cultivate and collect yourself. Learning is wealth enough, and you endeavour to value knowledge and learning above mortal pleasures.

Cleric - Play like a european monk, healing the sick and aiding the poor.

Barbarian - You despise the rich, hedonistic ways of the city people. You long for the simple life of a tribesman, working for the good of the community, fighting for what is right, not for what is valuable. You may fight like a brute and a vicious maniac, but your heart is one of purity.

Bard - Music is everything. You won't sell out, man. You play to inspire, to bring happiness, to bring beauty to the world. All you ask for is food and board in exchange for the merriment you bring to the company you keep. You derive joy from playing and writing, and making people happy is all you need for fulfillment.

Rogue - You steal from the rich to give to the poor. You represent good, but your methods are less than legal. You live in the shadows, picking locks and sneaking through darkness, cutting fat purses to throw to the folk who live in the gutters. You don't steal for the thrill - you steal because there's no honest way of making the rich give up their gold.

Ranger - You strive to keep the forest safe. You don't want money or comfort - there are evil beasts out there that threaten society, and you must protect the civilized places of the world by living and working in the wild. Basically anyone who lives in the forest is an easy ascetic build.

Psion: You have honed your mind from a soft pink bag of thoughts to a razor-sharp weapon and tool. Petty gold and comfort don't satisfy you - in fact, you don't even care for them. You are the epitome of self-fulfillment, and your mind is your comfort. You are like the monk, but where others seek fulfillment through intense training of the body, you seek enlightenment from meditation and harnessing the power of the mind.

Warlord - You may be grand in title, but your duty is to your subjects and your soldiers. You are not a controller or an overseer - you are a leader and a protector. You maybe aren't the one who does the bulk of the killing, but your voice is a tool you use to inspire courage and faith. You don't delude yourself into thinking life is about comfy life in a walled city, but you also don't delude yourself into thinking there is glory to be had in conquest. You life to defend, controlling soldiers and guardsmen and militia in the war against the dark things in the world. People trust you to protect them, and in this world filled with darkness, you must inspire courage to those who help defend the light.

Assassin: There is no point in lying. The world is filled with evil, and more often than not, peace is too slow and not effective enough. Blades and poisons speak louder than words, and a well-placed slice can silence eons of tyranny. You are a cold-blooded killer, but that doesn't mean you have no warmth in your heart. You live amongst the poor, and take no bribes or payment - your duty is to protect the defenceless and destroy evil and corruption. But hey, you're no politician. You know a dirtier, darker path to salvation.

That's all the major classes I can think of."

It's an important part of the relationship that's meant to be worked on together.

(Please don't get mad but...) When I was in college, I was talking to two of my friends.  One was from Minnesota, the other was from the Philadelphia area (as was I, albeit slightly further away).  I was explaining that the Steelers (or the Pirates of the Penguins... I forget) suck and I hate them (again don't get mad).  Minnesota friend gets concerned and asks if I know where Philadelphia friend is from, assuming that Philadelphia is close to Pittsburgh.  I assure him that yes, I know where he is from, and I live closer to Pittsburgh than he does, and I'm still a good 3+ hours away.

My mother was born in western PA (Cambria County).  She insists that is the ""real"" Pennsylvania (but she is not a Pittsburgh sports fan).

But truly, my hatred for Pittsburgh teams comes from my original heritage, having been born in Baltimore, not because I live in Philadelphia. :-P

Of course, what is often said is: It's Pittsburgh in the west, Philadelphia in the east, and Kentucky in between."

Be honest with he, if you feel something for you ex, say it. If no, say it. Explain everything for he and tell your BF that you want to overcome everything just to stay with he. But CARE, you need to know if he's is prepared for this, because he seens to be jealous, so, saying you have a little crush yet on your BF could do a Break for you two. Try prepare he for it.

hylandw,DnD,1391057547.0,"Have you ever slept in jeans and a flannel shirt? Know how horrible you felt the next day?

Now imagine your jeans are interlocked metal plates with no modern foam padding and your flannel shirt is now a big, heavy metal monstrosity. It's not even possible to be in a comfortable position while in armour, let alone sleep in it.

I would halve all sleeping benefits. You would get, like, two hours tops. The benefits you gain would basically be what you'd get from a nap.

This doesn't mean you can't spend your guard shift in full plate.

Also, multiple nights would wreak havoc on a person's body and mind. Take a penalty to CHA first night, add INT next, then WIS, then STR, then DEX, then CON. The way this works is like this.

* First night: You wake up groggy and grumpy.

* Second night: You can't do math, it's too damn painful.

* Third night: You're doing stupid stuff. Things that common sense restricts.

* Fourth night: You're getting weaker. You need that time to recuperate.

* Fifth night: You're stumbling around. You're slow and inaccurate with your body and hands.

* Sixth night: Now you're fucked. You're sick and physically weakened.

I would say add -1 per score affected for each night with absolutely no sleep, but have max of -2 for little sleep. Thus, night 1 you have -1 CHA, third night with little sleep you have -2 CHA, -2 INT, -1 WIS. After six sleepless nights you would have -6 CHA, -5 INT, -4 WIS, -3 STR, -2 DEX, -1 CON. It makes sense if you think about it. Imagine the wreck you would be after six nights without sleep using the rules for mundane stats. Assuming the average commoner has 10 everything, you would have the charisma of an autistic 8 year old after 6 nights, and the wisdom of a fool.

No offence to autistic children, of course. It's just a general tendency, and there are exceptions."

keypuncher,ideasfortheadmins,1391057811.0,"Another variation of this idea might be to give subreddits an option to disable voting on threads at all for 24 hours - except for approved submitters.

This would be particularly useful for small subreddits, where the downvote trolls can outnumber the actual members of the community the subreddit is intended for.

The advantage here is that the moderators should be reasonably sure than their approved submitters are actually members of their community, rather than people opposed to everything their community stands for, who just come in and downvote everything.

Because there is a fairly low upper limit to the number of approved submitters a restricted subreddit can have, this would necessarily prevent posts from such a subreddit from ever hitting the front page, even after the restriction expired - but - it would allow the actual members of the community to decide whether *they* thought content was worthwhile to *them*.

IMO, this sort of thing is necessary because people have apparently found a way to game the voting system - if you look at a lot of the smaller subreddits that have a problem with the downvote trolls, almost everything in the subreddit has within 1 or 2 votes of the same number of downvotes as upvotes - no matter how many upvotes it has."

I made friends, partied for a while, enjoyed life and the new freedoms of living away from my parents.

Then it all went downhill. The friend I'd made ditched me really quick, and left me reeling. I was a quiet kid, so I had no idea how to make new friends easily. I spent much of my time alone, struggling with school and trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. I had a few breakdowns that first semester, I won't lie.

It was at this point in my life that I found [this](http://i.imgur.com/x8h4RyL.jpg).

At first I thought it was sort of funny, but for some reason that slogan really stuck to me. I've had it saved on my computer for four years now, because there's a beautiful statement there about life that I found in it. I've had moment where a lot was against me, but if I stopped to look around, there wasn't really any reason I couldn't pick myself up and move past it. Simply put, I'm not beaten until I literally can't get up and face my problems anymore.

That's how an internet meme saved my life."

It used to be used in a legitimate medical context- someone who had Down's syndrome could be called ""retarded"" and that would be perfectly okay. The medical community has moved away from this term. However, it still has strong associations with mentally handicapped people. So when you say ""oh my god you're such a retard!!"" to your friend when they do something stupid, you are associating a stupid act with a group of people (mentally handicapped people). I think there are other words to express the same sentiment that don't have the tangled up awkward associations of the word retard.

Nobody wants to be in that situation. I wouldn't want to advertise that situation either. I can totally understand why he would feel like a failure and want to keep your finances private. 

I also think your mother is awesome for helping you guys out like that. That's what any good family member should do when their relatives need a hand. 

I can see why you're upset as well. You have a health problem and need nutritious food. You both should communicate about finances. You should never be surprised by the amount of money you have. That being said, I have a emergency apocalypse fund that I keep hidden away so that I'm not tempted to spend it. Hopefully, I'll never have to use it.

Also be sure you're not putting too much blame your husband for your financial situation. A marriage is a partnership, you're just as much responsible for the state of your finances as he is. He's only 50% of the problem. You seem to be upset that your husband isn't providing you with adequate food or making enough money. I hope you realize that feeding yourself and your family is your responsibility as well. 

You mentioned your husband's low salary but you never mentioned your job or when you get paid. If you work too, bringing home the bacon is your job as well and you've got no right to blame your husband for having to eat ramen. Your salary, your problem. 

If you are a stay at home wife, maybe you could provide food for you and your family by growing some vegetables, being frugal, cutting coupons,  or you know, getting a job. "

I was never really popular, but I had more than enough friends. I think the awkward comes from no one wrangling in the over excitement when they are young. So when they get older they act in ways that makes people uncomfortable because it just seems like too much reaction for the situation. 


That is the best way I can explain what I mean. It is hard to word.  For me the awkward comes when people get too excited for their age, ya know?  You can get excited, but of you are acting like a 2 year old that just got a toy, it can make people uncomfortable.

In order to alter a transaction in a previous block, someone would have to resolve that blocks hash plus the hash of every block that comes afterwards.

And how much does ignoring them cost the community who has to see their posts and navigate around them?

qqwasd,AskReddit,1391060038.0,"As the most powerful country on the planet America is constantly under scrutiny from the rest of the world. This position has been taking willingly and through careful and considerate economic, industrial and military planning spanning around the last 200 years, as well as an aggressive foreign policy following the second world war. No other country is put up on a pedestal as high as America's, or scrutinized as carefully as America is by citizens of other nations. 

Now is this justified? I would argue that it is, as a country that proudly and willingly accepts the mantel of #1 and that it must also accept legitimate criticism of its system of government (and other domestic issues) and, in particular, its foreign policy. This is because it willingly places itself and believes itself to be the pinnacle of humanity, and thus deserves criticism when it, too often, doesn't meet this criteria, criteria that I personally believe it has placed on itself.

That being said classic America hate circlejerks about how overweight, dumb, conservative, etc. etc. the population is is completely unnecessary and disgusting. Criticisms that focus on the population of any country as a whole are, generally, useless as they by definition stereotype a diverse people. On the other hand criticisms focused on government, its policies, and major corporations are more warranted especially given the effect they have on the rest of the world. "

No one spot can be effectively designated as a safe spawn, so the game tries to place you somewhere where it think enemies won't hit you too quick. However, since you are never more that ten feet from three different flanking routes and you have at least 6 people running around at almost random, you are bound to spawn in close to someone.

That's the definition of sexism right there.  And if women had to think about how to *fund* that choice, maybe they'd think twice about doing it. 

Yes: I'm saying more abortions. There are kids alive who shouldn't have been born, because no one can pay for them.  That leads to misery for everyone.

Reddit_SuckLeperCock,truegaming,1391060936.0,"Depends what game, if it's a situation that I fantasize (even dream) about then I am the character. I have to be completely immersed in the story and game world though. For instance in Oblivion, after the completing all the Dark Brotherhood missions and getting all the premium stealth armour and weapons, I 'was' a thief/assassin for months afterwards. I'd create my own scenarios and missions, only leave the safe-houses at night time, travel all over the map in complete secrecy, kill my target or steal whatever, and retreat back into the shadows. I was that character, and it added hundreds of hours of fun gameplay for me.

In other games I can't make that transfer into the game character. Whether it be from a lack of immersion, or an 'unbelievable' game world or scenario, or there is too much character development where I can't build my own little world. Example - GTAV, the characters already have their own lives and I'm playing it out for them, so I just sit back and control.

So for me if the character's got room to insert my own personality traits in then I will take over and assume the characters life. If the development and story are already laid out for me then I will just play to that characters traits. "

Yeah, I don't put much of the blame Israel for the shitshow that is the Middle East.

The death statistics are always going to be flawed, because the Palestinians care less about their own people than making a point.

 Aside from the obvious threat of possibly facing easy jail time over future false accusations, there's a more fundamental reason you should leave. *Trusting* your partner to think reasonably enough to not have you potentially thrown in jail is some easy Relationship 101 material, and from the way you describe the situation, it sounds like that trust is long gone.

cbarrett1989,electricians,1391061882.0,"I get needing a drill and an impact driver, those are a necessity. Asking your workers to get a cordless sawzall by the next day is retarded and asinine. Asking your workers to go out and buy power tools like that is telling your workers to cover your overhead as a contractor. This goes double because I'm a temp worker, that's what set me off. If you're a contractor and you have a tool list then whatever, I agreed to it when I signed on but the temp company Im working for now has it's own tool list that contractors agree too and a sawzall is not on it.

Next, I really don't have 2 fucks to rub together about your 2 kids, house, driving your own car (because how else would you get to work?) or anything else for that matter since you came across like a snotty douche rag. The cost of living in Utah is much higher than Arizona, just so you know. 

Another thing, you don't fucking know me, you don't know anything about me so how the fuck would you presume that I'm any of what you said because I simply want to be paid more and not given ultimatums at work? Let me fill you in so we can be on an even keel. I spent $2-3,000 of my own money taking classes outside of the union to get certified in just about every thing that there's a certification for related to electrical work. I'm 1 of maybe a few hundred that have the amount of certs that I do in the **COUNTRY**. I'll give you a moment to let that sink in. I run my own business outside of the electrical trade as well. I make sure to keep 10 grand in my bank account and another 20,000 in my savings just because I can. At this stage of my life, I do electrical work for fun because I'm damn good at what I do and because if I didn't I'd get bored during the day. So for clarification my original post was about how I was being treated, not about money.  I went way above and beyond to make sure I was one of the most qualified electricians available and to me; working for $15 an hour is damn near insulting. Then to top it off being told ""bring X item, or don't show up to work"" is a shit bag move. This is a matter of principal to me, not about tools or money.

TL;DR go fuck yourself or read the post, either way go fuck yourself."
qqwasd,AskReddit,1391061883.0,"This is completely unreasonable. The vast majority of wars that have America has entered since WWII they have entered for selfish reasons, as opposed to any wish to ""help out"" another member of the international community. America has, in this period, acted almost exclusively in its own interests and occasionally this has been to the benefit of other nations involved. 

America's decision to join WWII was made to a large extent due to a wish to promote security in their region, and as a result of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. As an Australian I am, however, grateful for America's assistance in stopping the spread of the Japanese in the region. I'm not suggesting whatsoever that America should have not joined the war, however I don't think it can be claimed they did so out of generosity.

America joined the Korean war in an attempt to quell the spread of Communism in Pacific/Asia (their region) as it was in their interests to promote the spread of capitalism throughout the world and create allies in the region (as S. Korea is today). Again I am not expressing any regret that the north lost the war, merely pointing out the motivation of the United States.

The Vietnam War was exclusively fought for the motivation of preventing the spread of communism and, as a result, the power of the USSR. I would like to remind you that this war was fought against a government which garnered the majority of popularity in both the north and south of Vietnam. As a result of American involvement countless innocent lives on both sides of the conflict were lost needlessly. 

The conflicts fought by America, or with American assistance, in the Middle East and North Africa over the past ~30 years, including conflicts in which America provided military assistance. The US has a long history (again since WWII) of supporting whoever they decided would benefit them the most, initiating and supporting extremist uprising which resulted in dictatorships (Iran) and supporting misogynistic, racist and oppressive governments (Saudi Arabia). Although Saddam Hussein was an oppressive, dictatorial and racist leader he was far from the worst in the region, even compared to governments with direct US support (including Qaddafi and Saudi Arabia) and his country sported some of the best social conditions in the region prior to the conflict. 

I could write thousands and thousands of words on this issue but really if you want a TLDR its unreasonable to suggest that the world calls on America for help and then blames them for joining, I cannot think of a single instance when this has occurred. "

The point is perspective. I being in the tech sector am currently enjoying while being employed, a great deal of job offers and opportunities keeping me far from unemployment. This economy is very affluent right now. I've heard statistics as high as 5 jobs for every 1 candidate. Less skilled, old economy metrics do not show such a great picture.

And all this is microscopic as we consider all else that goes into economic analysis, and how we form policies based on our findings.

My best study times is when their favorite shitty tv shows are on. To be honest my shows are on then too, but english television having on-demand makes it not matter..I don't think I've watched live premiere televisions in a long while...

They value their fucking shows over anything else. Which is such hypocritical bullshit. When I was younger they'd call me to prayer at exactly the climax of a show. Not 15 mins earlier, not 15 later. And I always get fucking yelled at for asking for few minutes. But their shows? No problem. Hell I wanted to pray and go to bed at time, but couldn't because those god damn fucking shows.

I think we can both agree on the ""bad"" being the couple of people who come in and spout off internet bullshit or something stupid for a reaction, right?

The implication was that the posts of the few that you were responding to or referring to in a heated fashion had no value to them and aren't examples of actual/realistic thought. I suppose I should have said outright ""they have no value to them"", but I figured it wasn't that hard to see that.

No one actually goes up to someone and says ""ha ha ha single beta male"" much in the same way that it's not ""common"" or ""societally accepted"" that men and women ""can't be friends unless they're having sex"".

I also offered to help her if she wanted (that's what she was looking for.) 

Well, I shipped it out and saw that 2 days before she received mine her original santa came through even though it was well past the original due date. Well, now I feel awkward.

(like their standard example is that you come across a talking mollusc that asks you for help. you pick the dialog option to say ""Hey let's kill it and sell it instead"" and your partner either agrees or says ""no, I object to that, let's do what he asks and take him back to the sea"" and then you can relent or pick persuade or threaten and if your stats are high enough you win or they win, etc =&gt; just google it, they have quite a lot of preview stuff out where they talk about the game and what kind of complexity they are aiming for) "

Moderates, either gun owners or gays, all have mixed reactions to it.  They don't like being associated with those extremists, but those extremists are making the less flashy people seem like rational moderates.

The UAE has a boatload of oil money, sure, and a functioning economy, but it's not a real modern country, not by any objective standard. It's got one of the highest rates of human trafficking of any country, it practices sharia law (it's not secular if homosexuality and publicly eating during Ramadan is illegal and wife beating isn't) and human rights are a joke. It's not unlike Qatar. And what those periphery countries have in common isn't distance for Israel (because, you know, Libya, Tunisia, Turkey, Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan aren't doing so great either), it's oil. That's why Saudi Arabia has managed to steer clear of the whole thing. When you've got money, holy wars aren't worth fighting.

1. I believe even if they had pulled off the maneuver successfully, the team would've still been reprimanded. Not trying to compare apples and oranges here, but your line of reasoning would suggest that if I were driving drunk and did not cause any accidents I should not be punished.

2. If I remember correctly, the dead *boy* was pressured into performing the maneuver despite his trepidation and misgivings. Who are we to speculate on the intentions and wishes of a dead fictional character, but if it were *me* I would want the whole sordid affair to be exposed so that nobody else will suffer the same fate.

3. Sure, Not-Paris took the fall, but he was the one that insisted they try and pull off the maneuver. He was the team leader and really, the death of their squad mate rests quite firmly on his shoulders.

The problem lies in human behavior. Many (dumber) guys assume, ""Yeah, polygamy bro! Banging three different chicks, dude!""

The reality of it is that women will in turn go for the top 1% of guys. Maybe not all women, true, but a proportionate enough number of women would be more than willing to be the fourth or fifth wife to a Forbes 400 CEO or a millionaire rock star. This would have the effect of creating a shortage of suitable companions for middle-class, ""regular"" guys.

That's why you limit the amount of rifles you buy second round and have those people stay back to pick since the opposition doesn't have range.

Don't underestimate the advantage you can get with one rifle when the previous opposition was a bunch of pistols. It is stupid to put yourself in that position.

hylandw,DnD,1391063661.0,"Flavourwise, a warlock gets their arcane power from an eldritch pact and a sorcerer gets theirs from innate ability. Attackwise, it's a little different. Warlocks get a variety of different attacks with different damage types depending on their build (fire and necrotic for infernal, etc.), whereas sorcerers (I think, I'm not sure) get to choose a damage type for the day and many of their powers are based on this. Now, in comparaison to a wizard, both a warlock and a sorcerer seem to be much more focussed on a target. They also are more focussed on damage, having their effects as bonusses to more powerful attacks, whereas wizards focus on damaging groups of enemies and dealing effects as powers of their own right.

The Middle-Length Discourses of the Buddha [Majjhima Nikaya] (Buddhist [Pali], c. 200–100 BCE). These discourses was delivered by the Buddha to the monks at Jetta Grove. In them, he described the progress of a man through hell. First stakes are put through his hands, feet and belly; then he is pared with axes and adzes, dragged by a chariot across a burning terrain, forced to climb up and down a mound of burning coals and finally plunged into a burning cauldron — all before he enters the Great Hell.

The Great Hell is an enclosure of burning iron with flames bursting from the walls, floor and ceiling. Four doors, one in each wall, periodically open and close and the man runs toward each only to have it close in his face. Finally when he does escape through the eastern door, he finds himself in the Hell of Excrement where he is bored through and through by needle-mouthed creatures. He escapes to the Hell of Hot Embers, then on to the Wood of Simbali Tress, where he is forced to climb up and down through their blazing thorns. In the following place, the Wood of Sword-leaf Trees, his hands, feet, ears and nose are cut off. He finally plunges into the River of Caustic Water where he is pushed upstream then downstream, until he is rescued by the wardens of hell, who ask him what he wants. When he complains of hunger and thirst they force red hot balls and molten copper down his throat, which burn his insides and rip through his intestines. “Yet, he does not die,” so long as the evil act that landed him in hell has not exhausted its result."

I've had customers that left a roll in a desk drawer for 5+ years where its temperature would be pretty consistent and even still nothing was decipherable when the roll came out. Film in those disposables is very very easily damaged and expire quicker than most realize. So much of the film I developed ended up being very low quality and not even worth printing.

Compared to the beginning of the quarter, I've gained so much knowledge in these subjects; in doing so, I have also realized that (as with any subject) there is *so much* more to know than I ever imagined. The result? I feel like I have an infinitesimal knowledge of the subject, and that's probably true, but that small amount of knowledge is *much, much* more than I knew before I studied it. As the old adage says: the more you study a subject, the more you realize you know almost nothing about it. 

In the broader context of the discipline itself, sure, I know next to nothing. But, when compared to my own knowledge before and after, I've gained a great deal. "

Your family is destroyed and you must hate each other for the rest of your pitiful lives!""

Yeah, that never happens.

The people who get divorced have reasons.  They may not seem like good reasons to you, but it's better that they not be kept together in the same house, torturing each other and the kids.

A rough divorce is one you didn't see coming.  (Happened to me!)  But that doesn't mean it was a bad thing.  Someone choosing to go through a divorce is opting for something better.

He lives and works in a towering city who's lifeblood is the trade that flows through the mountains and the factories in the city that supply that trade. Searching for his abducted niece he travels deep into the foundations of the city.

**The Legacy of Lord Regret** by Sam Bowring. Hundreds of years ago an evil wizard experimented with damaging the fabric of reality. 7 heroes rose to fight him and soundly defeated him, each taking into themselves some of the corruption that the evil wizard had caused. Years of infighting follow, ending with the deaths of all 7. Nobody fixed reality, and now it has brought them all back. Great character work for the 7 heroes and a really interesting magic system are the high points. Two of the 7 are female, but one of those dies on page 3.

For example, I've spent the past couple of days with a really weird idea for a guitar pedal that would come out of combining two of my own pedals. So, I looked up the schematics for both and started taking them apart in my head, trying to see which one was which. 

For memories and such, I don't use clues like that, if I go off on a tangent (which I do very, very often), I try to trace my steps back to the original thought, but sometimes it'll still be fresh in my mind if I remember to keep it in the back of my head while I'm tangenting (this all could be an ADHD warping though).

For Te vs. Ti, that's another point of confusion. I'm definitely more interested in how things work. For the bending evidence, I think my words got mixed up or something, because I build theories and ideas based off of absolute evidence. I'm not that invested in my own ideas and beliefs and theories, as they're incredibly flexible to allow for new evidence.

I completely follow the Fi thing, though. However, the one thing that piqued my interest for Fe was, ""Doing things for others to show loyalty. That's something I do a whole lot, and after reading a little more, I'm definitely sure I'm more Extroverted Feeling than Introverted Feeling.

One other thing I want to do is look at the subtypes with the Informational vs. Existential descriptors that /u/squigglu105 posted. That's why I'm here anyway, to learn more, heh.

Finally, I feel like I should say the one thing that told me I wasn't INTJ was that I looked at some video samples of INTPs and INTJs answering questions, and I identified more with the INTP videos, it was kind of like looking into a mirror.

S-Flo,KillLaKill,1391065111.0,"I'm aware of how honorifics work (I'm currently six months into Japanese classes at my university). I'm saying that leaving them there is hamfisted and lazy translation work. A good translator can transmit the original intent behind the text without having to leave artifiacts from the source language there.

Some random examples off the top of my head:

&gt; Always write names out in the English **[Given Name, Surname]** format. Sure, it's not how you write names in Japanese, but we're not writing in Japanese right now, are we? Writing ""Matoi Ryuko"" serves to confuse an occasional reader, but not much else.

&gt; Just writing ""Kiryuin Satsuki-Sama"" is lazy. Using 様 shows respect and/or higher rank in this context. You can show that using something else like ""President Kiryuin"", or ""Her Excellency Satsuki Kiryuin"" if you feel the extravagance fits better.

&gt; With Matarou, the use of 様 suggests extreme arrogance on his part. You could easily replace ""Lightning Speed Matarou-Sama"" with something like ""The Great Lightning Speed Matarou"".

&gt; Mr. Mikisugi refers to Ryuko using the honorific 君 (kun). This simply denotes his senior status relative to her and can be left out as that relationship is already implied (he is the teacher, after all).

&gt; Similarly, Mako calling Ryuko ""Ryuko-chan"" is unimportant in English. The use of ちゃん in this instance implies close friendship (or Mako being overly familiar with someone she just met). The rest of her dialogue makes it painfully obvious that she's coming on too strong, so you don't really need to include an English equivalent."

blastfromtheblue,changemyview,1391065384.0,"what irritates me is you forcing your bike onto roads designed explicitly for cars and acting so entitled about it.

first of all, there do need to be better laws for cyclists on the road. as it stands now, it is risky for bikes on the road-- for everyone. roads weren't designed with bikes in mind, including many laws and features intended for safety and efficiency for which the haphazard introduction of cyclists compromises. secondly, we need better infrastructure for cyclists. bike lanes are a nice first step, but it's not nearly enough.

i'm not fully against sharing the road. with proper planning, this would be a big success for a million reasons. but we thought carefully about laws and infrastructure for cars without bikes in mind, and introducing cyclists to this infrastructure throws a monkey wrench into the whole thing and compromises all we've worked hard in terms of efficiency, but even more importantly *safety*.

for me to change my mind about this would require studies that show that cyclists on the road right now, with our current laws and infrastructure, are just as safe as ever (within a reasonable margin of flexibility).

again, i would love for bikes to have proper infrastructure. but if it is going to be on the roads we have now, there will need to be way more changes to account for them. for the time being, i think it's best if cyclists stay off the road."

Having spent a lot of time reading Calvin, I would argue that Calvin would answer that we all deserve to go to hell because we have all inherited the depravity of original sin and humans are all unworthy of anything good without the aid of divine grace.  The aid of divine grace that is only offered to a few people.  Calvin argues that even giving grace to these few people is actually very generous of him, because he doesn't owe depraved humans anything at all.  

However, personally, I feel that Calvinists tend to sidestep the question of how original sin came about in the first place.  Calvin sort of suggests early in book two of the Institutes that there might have been a flaw in God's creation if Adam and Eve so easily fell prey to sin.  But in the thousand succeeding pages this is never brought up again, and I rarely see a Calvinist mention it."

Amazon has an Oster blender refresher kit for ~$6 that includes a base cap, gasket and ice crusher blade, if you wanted to have an extra base and blade to prep 2 smoothies without washing in between.

I have a Vitamix and several containers for it, but I use the stupid Oster one way more often because of the compatibility with the Mason jars. I can do a couple of tablespoons of dressing in a 4 ounce jar in less time than it takes me to drag out the Vitamix.

nesfor,Drugs,1391066365.0,"The three things I keep in mind most are research, moderation, and respect.

Research - every combination or dose you're going to do is almost guaranteed to have been tried before; the information is out there. Research tolerances, doses, proper use, health effects, and interactions with other substances or medications. Also research different methods of getting high and which are most cost-effective or feel the best.

Moderation - always start low, both with new substances and with using in general, until you know yourself, your limits, and your weaknesses. Set limits *before* you try something new; if you can't stick to what you came up with in a reasonable and objective state of mind, the substance is problematic. 

Respect - be humble in your approach to drugs. Respect yourself, other people, and the drugs themselves. Don't think yourself invincible -- your body has physical and mental limitations, and you have to observe them. Carefully consider other people's advice, and don't be afraid to ask for help. Drugs are very powerful things. Just make sure you're controlling them and not the other way around."

My hope is $0.01 in a year, and maybe $1 once all coins been mined, credibility is established and a cottage industry of traders, exchanges, financiers and programming interfaces are built. That puts it at a $100 billion market cap, which is pretty incredible. It also means that dogecoin is big enough to be very useful, but still small enough for everyone to get their hands on some dogecoin and spread it around (the point of this in the first place).

On the other hand, I could be totally wrong. It could only ever peak at $.005 per coin. It could disappear tomorrow because someone manages to build a more fun, more useful, more proactive community (in which case, hey, kudos to them). Or it could go to $10 in six weeks because China's economy crashes and they decide to pin the Yuan to the value of the Doge.

&gt;just an excuse for Roosevelt to do what he'd wanted all along

It enabled him the support of the government, who had previously resisted joining the war. I also referenced his wish to maintain security within the Pacific region, which was in America's interests. 

&gt;Rwanda

America's lack of involvement in Rwanda was stated by Clinton as his biggest regret of his career. I hardly think its fair to state that the international community was unjustified in their disappointment at this lack of involvement, when Clinton himself has criticized it. 

I stated ""its unreasonable to suggest that the world calls on America for help and then blames them for joining, I cannot think of a single instance when this has occurred."" Rwanda does not fit the bill here as America never provided any help. America and NATOs involvement in Yugoslavia/Bosnia is not widely criticized, and held up as one of the best examples of America properly utilizing its role (to a degree self appointed) of the world's policemen.

YoungFolks,asktransgender,1391067761.0,"&gt;How do you know you are a different gender?

I didn't know until a couple years ago that I wasn't female, and I didn't know until a few months ago that, actually, I'm a guy. Most of my life I didn't question my gender. I had a female body, people referred to me as ""she"", I didn't mind make up or skirts. I just thought I wasn't feminine. That I hated the social roles of women, and I just didn't like being called ma'am. That being mistaken for male and looking androgynous was just fun. That I hated my voice because it was high and girly. That I disliked people commenting on how small my waist is, how curvy my figure is, how good I look in a dress, etc because of normal insecurity with your body. That I preferred guy clothes because they fit me better and actually made sense. That I always cosplayed as a guy because they just happened to be my favorite characters. That tried my best to ignore that periods are a thing and ended up with bloody sheets way too often because periods suck, no girl likes them. That I sometimes thought about cutting off my breasts, or sewing the genitals shut, but everyone daydreams about weird stuff. That I was jealous of men because they were men and could do things I couldn't because of stupid biology and patriarchy and all that.  But obviously I couldn't be trans. 

I did eventually realize I'm not female, and identified as genderqueer/agender for a while. Then one night I was surfing youtube and found transition videos of FTMs. Holy shit, testosterone is fucking powerful. I felt such intense envy for those guys. I spent the next few days researching the shit out of FTMs and testosterone and gender. I really, *really* wanted the effects of testosterone. I realized it was possible to one day be indistinguishable from any other guy and I've rarely wanted something so badly. 

So, that's how I know I'm a guy. Oh, and a lot of my behaviours and thoughts and feelings and reactions line up with guys more than girls. And writing that out gave me some feels, so I apologize in advance if the rest of my reply is subpar. 

&gt;What is the process (including hormones) for changing?

The ladies have already explained the medical side way better than I could. On the social and personal side, usually the first thing is coming out, before you start presenting. I did the opposite. I've been presenting male for much longer than I've even known I was male. Guy clothes were just more comfortable. There's finding a new, gender confirming name. Coming out to people. Figuring out what kind of man/woman you want to be. Figuring out how you want to transition. Switching pronouns. Learning how to look male/female. Learning new social roles and expectations, which often involves relearning old behaviour. Medical transition, if you decide to go with it. Figuring out how you and the people close to you will adjust to the transition. Learning to be comfortable in gendered spaces like bathrooms. Getting used to people treatimg you differently than they did before you looked like your gender. Getting used to people having different expectations of you. 

&gt;How can I (as someone with no experience in this) treat someone who is transgender? 

Just remember you're talking to a person and treat them with respect. Everyone is different, so specifics will vary. If you're not sure, for example you don't know what pronouns to use, either avoid pronouns altogether or politely ask them what they prefer. Don't ask any questions you wouldn't ask another guy/girl, unless you know for sure they won't mind. Don't go out of your way to show you accept them as their gender, because that actually does the opposite of being reassuring. You'd still be singling them out as different. Don't ever out them unless you explicit permission. It's okay to stumble over new names/pronouns at first, especially if you've known them by something else for a while. It can be a hard habit to break, but do try. Don't assume anything about them, because people are different. "

bigtcm,AskReddit,1391068049.0,"I just stopped caring about what people thought of me. I was a shy kid for my entire childhood, until my senior of high school.  I'm such an easy target - I'm awkwardly tall, a complete bookworm, and sort of the forever alone type. I had a nerdy haircut. I didn't wear any name brand clothing. I had big glasses because I'm super near sighted. By the time senior year rolled around, I just didn't care about what the popular kids were up to and what they were wearing. I realized how all that shit was petty and stupid and wouldn't matter in a year. I just concentrated on my schoolwork to get into college. 

Funny enough, I had a confidence boost when that ""not caring"" mentality hit. My senior year was a blast - I was surrounded by good people everywhere. And that confidence carried over and ballooned when I got into college - where EVERYONE was just as nerdy as I was. 

During the summer between my freshman and sophomore year of college, I went back home and saw my high school friends. All of them wondered what the hell happened to me - all of a sudden I became this gregarious, funny, extroverted guy with a beautiful girlfriend, obsessed with the fact that I'm a lanky six and a half foot tall Asian.

I realize now that when you're not true to yourself and ""trying to fit in"", you may come off as awkward and weird. Just embrace who you are and people will like you for that. "

I can't tell you what to do here, but you do need to know that while you're experience has been positive so far, the reason for that is because you're doing exactly what they want women to do. It's fine that you do, because you want it, but the general idea is that they feel this is some inherent thing in women and that we should all do this.

And at some point you'll find your limit of agreement with a movement that tries to dictate what others should do (as was your personal experience with feminists), and there's a probability that they will stop welcoming you. 

But it's your decision, just keep your sense of individualism as that's the most important thing (as long as you don't harm others). I hope you meet better feminists in the future."

ToastyXD,WTF,1391068227.0,"I don't think you're an ass, you're just misinformed.

Reason being, as with any culture or community, we all have our extremists: Westboro Baptist Church for example. The reason why they get more attention is because they are more controversial with what they do. That being said, the people displayed in the above picture does not speak wholly for the gay community. 

Also with this photo, I believe it may be a celebration of some sexapalooza sort of thing, or it could be this gay porn site called bound in public. I also find it ironic that they chose pandas because pandas are so lazy, they have to be coaxed to have sex. That's why they're an endangered species.

I agree with you though to a certain extent. The gay community holds massive Pride Parades and although they are wonderfully fun and exciting, I dislike the fact of how sexual it is. I mean, yes eating a rainbow penis lollipop is fun, but seeing men and women on the verge of nudity and claiming it as self-expression is absolutely ridiculous. I have went to two parades and it only gets worse with time. You have teenagers, kids from 14-19 prancing around in only their undergarments that hug them so close and expose so much. The bad rep that pride parades get from the public for being provocative, deplorable, and unfit for kids is correct and the argument against it is not to bring your kids because it's a Pride Parade is completely idiotic. To me, a Pride Parade should be celebrating the fact that I can go out in public, sit at a nice restaurant perpendicularly of my boyfriend (he hates sitting across from each other and says this angle allows for more conversation/stimulation), and it will all be normal. I won't have people constantly giving me evil eyes, people screaming at me that what I do is a sin and I should burn for it. I don't have to fear of being who I am and I don't have to be alone. That's what a pride parade should e about, being able to be who we are without restraint: being accepted. "

""Go to /r/MURICA if you want to be patriotic about your shitty country, don't take it to /r/circlebroke, this sub could actually be quite good without all this, 'hurr durr americans are so persecuted' bullshit.""

""the American version is a little dumbed down and a lot easier to understand, whereas the British one's a little more complex.""

And the icing on the fucking cake: **""As for your second point, I haven't seen any Europeans criticise Americans just for being American""**

A few more subtle jabs at America, plus your constant whining that European people get discriminated on the site and that there is a constant American circlejerk. 

I really don't get how you can think of yourself as a better fan of a team than someone from a different place if you actually have a disdain for that fan being from a different place. Any American who comes across an American sports fan in another country most likely thinks ""Cool, I never would've guessed my team would have fans (insert place here)"" Not ""oh I'm a LOCAL fan, the fans from elsewhere DONT GET what it means to be a real fan"". And the fact that you had to put your location in your reddit username is a pretty pathetic ""look at me I'm a true fan"" call for attention. And when would anyone get confused about your location by your name, besides the fact that no person whos actually from north london would make their name that.

And to answer any quick ""witty"" retorts: Yes I am American. Yes I was very bored to look through your comments, after another user pointed out your constant war against the American devil. No I don't give a fuck if I support a team in a completely foreign place.

YoungFolks,asktransgender,1391068988.0,"&gt;man-in-a-woman's body or vice-versa,

I realize you're coming from a position of ignorance and are seeking to improve your knowledge. Kudos. That said, this is a story that is perpetrated by the media because it is sensational, arouses sympathy in cis people, and is unlikely anything a cis person will experience so it's unthreatening. But it is innacurate. Just going by people in this and other trans subreddits, a lot of people *don't* feel trapped in the wrong body. There is dysphoria, of course, but not every trans person has the same experience of it. Many don't realize they're trans until later in life, or experience a lot of self-doubt and anxiety because the most common narrative, which only applies to a portion of transfolk, doesn't match their experience.

&gt;or what made you decide to go forth with your operation?  
 
This is another thing sensationalized by the media. First, there's no one mahical surgery where you go in, and come out with a new body. There are a lot of different surgeries, that do different things with the genitals and surgeries for breasts, and other things. But they aren't necessary to be trans, and a lot of trans people don't want them. But the surgery isn't even the most important part of transition (for most people). That honor belongs to hormone replacement therapy. It's basically like puberty, and your body changes in sometimes very stark ways. Transwomen develop breasts and their fat goes to the hips, transmen's voices drop to a male range, and they develop facial hair. There are more changes, of course, but you get the idea.

That is, we used to, but as a teenager I quickly discovered that I couldn't get away with the same things. That sarcastic, slightly-morbid type of humour was often taken serious, or questioned (which was funny in its own right, because the things I said should have been hard to take serious so I just abuse that fact now). 

Joke insults were funny when he told then, they were 'shocking' when I did, met with gasps. So now he's the funny guy and I'm the pessimistic therapy gal.

I think men feel more freedom to make jokes, or rather  certain type of jokes that are often considered to be the most funny in general. They're the self-depricating, critical and sometimes morbid kind of jokes. With the pressure to be gentle, kind and submissive as a woman, self-deprication may seem sad or pathetic.

It wouldn't be reasonable to describe it *as* racism now (people with Irish heritage in no sense being an oppressed minority in the modern US), but I think that's almost certainly its root.

""I remember the dealer on 49th street. 

The dealer on 49th street was a friend of mine."" I began, my voice rising in anger, ""I was never the kind to purchase dreams, but when I watched him killed that day, he sold me a greater dream than any dream you can have in your sleep. He sold me the dream of freedom.

When the dealer on 49th street was shot, I saw men crying. These weren't the sleepers, they weren't the kinds that slept the night away. No, these three were kids, hardly 16. When I asked them what the fuck they needed DREAMS for, they told me that their art required these dreams; that when they did not dream, they did not feel any inspiration at all.

A respectable looking woman, too. I asked her if she was a friend of the dealer, she said no. She was his clientelle. I told her she didn't look the kind to be involved in illegal trade. She told me that her religion demanded that she dreamed, or so she felt. She said that, without the dreams, she was not receiving the dreams which were messages from God.

I saw that day a pair of young men crying. When I asked them if they'd known the dealer, they said no. They said they were crying because he was dead, thouhg. The said that if the annihilation squads were killing mere dream dealers, surely they, being two men involved in a relationship, would be next.

But it was the dealer of dreams, and his final words, 'I merely desired to free the people from those jackbooted thugs, even if just in their dreams' that sold me on the idea.

The idea that we MUST rise up. When a criminal is better seen as a hero, when we have no say in the matter, when his death is fast and without trial, when his death strikes fear into the hearts of the many, then surely, surely by that time it is time to rise!"""" 

I threw my fist into the air, and drew a cry from the audience.

""Tonight, we fight. If we die, we die like the dream dealer from 49th street. If we live, we live free! We will be free to dream at night. We will be free to produce art! We will be free to follow our religion! We will be free to hold our lover's hand! We will be free of death squads! Tonight, those of us who live will live free, or we will die!""

TheToastofBotswana,AskUK,1391073184.0,"Give way to traffic coming from the right (checking for idiots on your left ignoring the rules) is the basic rule.

If your exit is to your left indicate left. If it's ahead of you don't indicate until you're about to turn off the roundabout then indicate left to show cars waiting to get out that you're leaving the roundabout. If the road you want to take is to your right then indicate right when you come up to the roundabout (going around in an clockwise direction as always) and then indicate left as you're turning off.

If you're entering a roundabout with 2 lanes keep in the left lane for turning off to the left or straight ahead on the round about. Take the right lane for turning off to right or doing a u-turn. If your roundabout has 3 lanes then left for left turn, middle for straight, right for turning right.

That sounds very complicated but it isn't. Keep these things in mind: 1. The flow of traffic around a roundabout is always clockwise. 2. Give way to traffic coming from your right but expect people on your left to pull out anyway, especially if you're dawdling. "

Deezl-Vegas,changemyview,1391073343.0,"Language is used and messages are transmitted entirely differently in different mediums. For a good example, read The Count of Monte Cristo and then watch the movie. The experience is quite different, though the story points are roughly all the same.

The reason for this is that a director has up to three hours to portray all of the major plot points. Therefore, movies focus on developing suspense through plot. However, Dumas' original novel was serialized, meaning that he actually had a year or more of dedicated readership with which to build suspense from month to month.

Dumas' job was to resolve the suspense from one sequence of events to the next while advancing an overarching plot. The result was the greatest tale of revenge ever told because his main character needed to keep looping through smaller story arcs to get to the main points, which were held in suspense until just the right moment when certain things were revealed that brought everything crashing down in a thrilling climax.

In the movie, you get the plot points and a bit of the cleverness and panache of the characters, but you can't possibly experience the entire ride the way it was spelled out in the novels.

Another good example is poetry, which often changes form greatly when read aloud. Ever wonder why you hate poetry slams as much as the next guy? It's because on paper, their poems are mostly shit. However, when read aloud by a sufficiently talented/emotional actor, they can be transformed from written shit into something super interesting. The medium influences the interpretation, but the great poets, like Yeats and Shelly and Browning, could be read with the eye or aloud and still carry great effect."

nutrecht,cscareerquestions,1391073549.0,"The main issue is not the language but the frameworks. It simply takes a long time to learn all the .Net frameworks you'll need when building a large webapplication. You also probably also only have 'some' Java experience, but no experience actually building large applications in a team. 

It really depends on the type of company. In many companies that need developers to do integration work you tend to do a lot of work in different languages. Other companies are highly specialized in for example Java, and want someone with that level of experience.

Any good developer can learn the basic syntax of a language in a week or so, and get compfortable in another week. But actually knowing all the nuances of all the Java frameworks a company uses takes a lot longer."

letrainfalldown,berkeley,1391074278.0,"This might help:

The top applicants I know of (e.g. those who got at least an interview for the Regent's and Chancellor's Scholars Association) stood out in some way beyond grades. In my high school, we had like 5 or 6 valedictorians. I think pretty much everyone was admitted to Berkeley, but only 1 of them got fall admission and an interview, besides one other person who didn't quite make valedictorian but was very close. The others were all spring admits (and most ended up coming here). 

You know what differentiated the two who got fall admission and the rest of the valedictorians? Those two did competitions. The other valedictorians definitely had their own extracurriculars, including being sports stars, but the two who got invited to interview/received fall admission was because they both competed in the national Chemistry Olympiad. In addition, one did really well in Winter Guard and Marching Band (and probably a host of other stuff I don't know about), while the other did really well in state business competitions and qualified for international competitions, in addition to interning for a national magazine and some other things. 

I also have a few Regents' Scholars friends who are currently freshmen, and one of them has interned for Intel pre-college, in addition to building stuff with an Arduino, doing biochem research, and taking classes at UC Davis before coming here.

I believe that Berkeley is very formulaic in their admissions, and so grades and test scores are just the minimum to get your foot in the door. What will secure you a spot is to have extracurriculars that stand out. Don't do what everyone else does to try to stand out - do something that shows that you can excel in multiple areas, and if you can, participate in competitions where you can get to a national or international level (which is actually easier than it sounds if you look for the right kind of competitions).

Deezl-Vegas,changemyview,1391074376.0,"Two hundred years ago, people lived like the Amish do today. If you didn't get off your ass and do work for 6-10 hours a day, people would starve, your roof would leak, you would stink like a motherfucker, and your family would probably get sick and die. A hundred years ago in the dust bowl, the poor of the midwest migrated to California to pick bushels of fruit for less money than it cost to stay alive, and most people still lived like the Amish or in cities.

Progressively, we've gotten better at institutionally resolving the problems that life throws at us, but the young grow up used to the solutions that their parents could not take for granted. Each generation feels more entitled than the previous because, for them, life comes with more stuff. You probably don't realize how entitled you are, but imagine if your parents never bought you or helped you pay for a phone and a car and a computer. You would be the saltiest motherfucker on the planet. But kids having cars wasn't a thing during your grandparent's time, and your parents came on to cell phones around the same time you did.

So wait, wasn't it like this for every other generation?

No, it wasn't. In fact, this is all a product of the industrial revolution allowing technology to scale and be distributed worldwide. Before that, everyone was Amish from 4000BC-1600AD. You will never experience hardship like they did. Part of the reason America was so involved in slavery is because picking cotton from a field is fucking hard. A few inventions come along and everyone's life improved a thousandfold, political tyranny was reduced, and individual autonomy skyrocketed. Now we expect it.

Hell, one of the characters introduced in that only shows up once outside of Railgun, in the background, in a single piece of artwork.

For completed story in Railgun, it's iffy. You could say the Level Upper arc ended and be happy with it, but the second half has the Poltergeist arc (with the bore which is the Big Spider arc in-between the two), which is basically a continuation on the circumstances which caused Level Upper to happen in the first place. You will be confused if you skip it and watch the first episode of Railgun S (but that episode itself should be skipped if you're familiar with the series), and the characters show up again in the 2nd half of Railgun S.

So, skip it if it bores you and you don't plan on watching the 2nd half of Railgun S. You won't miss anything important that way. If you do plan on watching the 2nd half of Railgun S, you can still skip the Big Spider arc and miss nothing.

&gt; There are good blogs and bad blogs that have covered it. I occasionally browse Jezebel and have never seen anything that has offended me, so am open to reading any offending articles (pun intended) you can link me to.

No, I would say that all the blogs talking about it as some insidious, evil oppressor-patriarch class attribute are all equally shitty.

I will preface by saying that I am at least some sort of egalitarian, at least at the most basic level-- and I find all of jezebel's content to be either disgusting or ridiculous or outright delusional-- and not just for that one site, basically all of the like-minded feminist sites are just as bad, if not worse.

I do remember from the textbook however that IQ is determined either by genetics or environment (no brainer), and that a person's IQ is highly influenced by their environment at a younger age and as time goes by genetics have a larger role.

E.g. someone is a very positive environment for high IQ with good factors may have a slightly higher IQ, but over time that decreases to their ""genetic"" IQ, while the opposite can happen where someone in a detrimental environment with a low IQ initially will/can increase to their genetic IQ. We don't really know why though, its likely a culmination of many factors such as the person's personality and others.

But my point more is that IQ is dependent on heaps of factors that we don't really know much about and struggle to control for. I agree with your initial premise in that the world might be better if some really stupid people don't have stupid kids but it's much harder figuring out how to carry that out. And IQ is probably not the best measure of Stupidity.

Also as a general rule when the government starts seriously restricting the reproductive rights of its people things go funky. Look at China, their one child policy, and the gender ratios what with underground female abortions.

Also, what happens when you have children that fall below the cut off line. Sorry Jimmy, you're not smart enough to stay in this elite population. Go live in the uneducated slums.

Have some more cool things: 

* **The Campanile** and the carillon recitals/concerts there. Finding a carillon (the instrument inside the bell tower) isn't as common as you think. I know someone else already mentioned going up to the top, but I wanted to suggest something further: Go up to the top and just *listen* to the power of the bells during a noon concert. It's enchanting. Better yet, also go on one of the two days a year the Campanile is open late and watch the sunset and when night falls, all of the little lights. 
* **CS 10.** Even if you never want to do CS, if you're curious about what the hype is all about and want to learn just a bit of what's going on in this era of web development and coding, it's a good class to take. The professor (Dan Garcia) is basically the most enthusiastic professor I have ever met, and the whole point of the class is to be fun. It is occasionally time-intensive, but it opens up a new way of seeing the world. You learn some of the basic CS concepts in the class. I personally really liked the class, but I know some who didn't - either way, it's the perfect class to decide whether or not you could ever consider a career in tech if that's something you're interested in, with none of the rigor and challenges of the 61 series and beyond.

ApolloX-2,islam,1391078846.0,"For me I felt like that for the longest time possible and had a weird sort of attitude towards religion. I rarely missed a prayer and would fast all of Ramadan the right way, read the quran, and even did ummrah. But for me it was like covering my bases because if there was an afterlife then I would be good. I never told anyone I was muslim and would never talk to anyone at the mosque and if I had to pray outside the mosque then I made damn sure my parents never saw me pray.

Then I started actually reading the translation of the Quran, and I didn't have some sort of epiphany that changed my view about everything and I started crying in my prayer and stuff like that, instead it was almost funny to me that humans actually needed divine intervention to be told not to murder each other.

I thought I could have easily come to these conclusions, but the world is full of idiots who need to be told by God not to steal, murder, or cheat.

I hate blind faith, and when people can't give me a good enough answer to the question ""why are you muslim?"" Then I get sort of disappointed.

There was one verse in the quran that made me laugh and realize how Allah predicted we would turn out. 

""The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah and then did not take it on is like that of a donkey who carries volumes [of books]."" Quran 62:5

Also, it was confirmed months ago that Imperial armor styles would be available in the game, the Imperial Edition just makes it immediately unlocked. The ability to change the style of gear to something else is, as far as I know, unique, but it's also purely cosmetic.

when you've sweated enough to make your shoes stanky you gotta let them sit outside, airdry, whatever. when you're doing sweaty activities bring a pair of shoes AND SOCKS - socks carry the stank - with you and change before and after. for instance when i was playing tennis i'd have my flippy floppies i'd rock before the match, then my tennis shoes, then the INSTANT I WAS DONE i'd change socks and back into my flippy floppies then take my shoes home to air out or whatever.

In the UK there are various residential colleges specialising in teaching young adults and older who have special needs or learning difficulties how to deal with 'the outside world'. They cover everything and the students get to experience a normal shot of life. They share housing, have dances, some even learn to drive and get jobs. They have relationships, go on holidays and trips to concerts and museums etc. 
The government pay for the students however some international businessmen and the like paid for their children to go, they have much better lives afterwards. They usually go into shared housing (still funded by the gov) with 2-3 other people and a couple of members of staff. 
In fact, I know of a man in his 60s who has only been in shared accommodation (he was institutionalised before the UK knew better) and is getting married and moving in to a new house with her.

Games provide a framework.  It's up to the players to make that framework fun.

It doesn't matter what you *can* do.  What matters is what makes the game better and more enjoyable for everyone involved.

If you're playing DnD, you *could* kill your whole party and then commit suicide.  Repeatedly.  Have everyone make new characters, and then kill them all.  It's totally allowable, it's in the rules.  

But it makes for a really shitty gameplay experience.  You can follow the rules, and still ruin a game.

redpandabear,sex,1391081914.0,"I've been told I give damn good head--but my last SO almost never came from it. I can count the number of times on one hand, even if I was missing a finger or two. So, a couple. But his case was particularly interesting; it wasn't that he didn't enjoy it, or that he masturbated too much (though, he did frequently enough). To him it was a mental issue, and he actually had to be *distracted* in order for it to work. The first time I recall most vividly; he was only able to achieve orgasm from me sucking his dick because he was also eating me out. It distracted him enough that he was able to let go. Apparently I was the first woman (as far as I know, only, but meh) to do it, though I'm pretty sure it was a combination of luck and skill.

As for how I typically do it... pretty basic. No need for a lot of tricks. Use a firm grip (not tight; firm) with one hand, and suck with your mouth. Just go with what feels natural in the moment (or what he asks for, if he does); whatever makes you happiest and most enthusiastic is going to translate pretty well. I couldn't say what my exact movements are. I just love sucking cock, so I go to town and enjoy the hell out of it. If I want his head to hit the back of my throat, I'll make it happen. If I want to tease the tip, I will. So long as he doesn't object, I just do what I want to.

So, in short... ask him. Maybe he masturbates too much, maybe it's a mental thing, maybe he just never really has been able to. Maybe you're thinking too hard about it and not just enjoying the moment. Hard to say.

But most importantly, enjoy *doing* it. Giving head isn't just for him; it should be exciting for you as well."

Cardboard_Boxer,whowouldwin,1391082509.0,"Daleks are tank-like cyborg alien warriors. They are very intelligent tactically and have an electric death ray that they can shoot from a gun on their armor. If a person gets too close to a Dalek it can also crush a person's skull with its plunger-like hand.

A Dalek's most obvious weakness is it's eyestalk, though it still takes a lot of concentrated damage to damage it. Otherwise, the Daleks are completely covered in a force field. They can also fly.

X's best bet would be using the Homing Torpedoes while taking advantage of the Dalek's lack of mobility. He would have to position himself in front of the Dalek in order to aim at its eyestalk while also moving quick enough to avoid its death rays.

Dalek technology is much more advanced than X's, so he'd likely be destroyed by just a hit or two. X could win, but it'd be an unlikely scenario in a very difficult battle."

* Shaper pool is really small.
* You can receive shapers for free from rolls after game (just this one alone can justify the price imo).
* 16-25 games is lower to get a shaper than most other mobas.
* Game length tends to be a bit lower compared to other mobas (I really can't state this as a fact, just from personal experience).
* I enjoy saving up for something, you put in some effort to gain something.

I've only played for a week, probably more games per day than avg. player, but I have made enough points to unlock 3 shapers, also got lucky and rolled one shaper. I'd say that's cheap."

wizardlegs,MvC3,1391084772.0,"Iron Man. Everything about him is just slightly off or lacking. He's so close to being amazing, he just needs a bit of tweaking.

The surprising thing about it, and why I think he has the worst design, is the fact that Marvel's whole deal with the game was pushing characters that have major movie franchises and such. It was a lot of promotion in their character selections. Iron Man is obviously massively successful in his movie appearances. And then there is his MVC3/UMVC3 character.... and it's just bleh. How could they do this to a character that is so loved?"

As Benio dreads, this is turning out to be a proper romcom. Also, some actual development between Kobeni and Hakuya was certainly nice, even if it was limited to Kobeni being able to tell Hakuya's moods (which appear as auras - is this guy Saotome Roman or something?)

Just a word of warning if you go through comparison sites like Late Rooms that for any cancellations etc have to be done through the website and not the hotel. They'll likely have a booking fee too. Always compare the third party price with the price on the hotels actual website or on the phone so you can see if it's cheaper like for like, if not ring the actual hotel and speak to in house reservations who can normally pull some negotiation. 

From my experience the least pain in the arse websites I had to deal with were Laterooms.com and bookings.com. Their bookings were always correct and they rarely fucked it up. However I dreaded Trivago and TripAdvisor calls because they created an entire world of issues like booking a single bed for 2 people or booking the wrong country on one occasion.

I guess having a shield tanking levi in a primarily armour tanking doctrine alliance would be pretty useless... I've always loved Caldari ships and wanted to fly a levi one day, but if it's pointless...

As someone who's only ever seen a titan once in passing, what are is the actual point of owning a titan? As I understand it, a titan cannot dock, presumably you have to either always keep a titan piloting character inside it, or leave it inside a POS (can it even fit inside a POS shield?).

You could argue it brings a lot of firepower to the field, with so much firepower and ehp you could effectively dominate a grid against enemies without a titan. But then that provies a few problems, firstly no one is going to go up against a titan if they have none of their own, so odds are they will immediately withdraw. That's good if you're trying to hold somewhere strategic, but sounds boring if you're actually looking for a fight. 

And secondly, whenever I read stories about a titan being deployed, it's always followed by other alliances deploying their own titans. It seems deploying a titan is a magnet for more titans, resulting in the titan brawl we saw in B-R5RB! So you're never really going to have the situation where you own the only titan on the field, there will always be others. I suppose it's like nuclear weapons and MAD. If anyone deploys a titan, everyone deploys their titans to try and level the field.

I guess once an alliance assumes so much isk and has bought everything else in the game, it's only logical to start building a titan..."

It does happen that children this age develop major psychological problems but it is incredibly rare. In addition, when psychological disorders do occur this early, they don't have one symptom in isolation, they have a spectrum of symptoms. It is *possible* your son has developed a psychological disorder, I think it is incredibly unlikely."

But there was a fair amount of frustration from a number of people that Sherwood chose to start him and leave Capoue on the bench.  Against a team like city that can shred any team in the league exposing the defense seemed like a very naive tactical decision.

During the match Bentaleb was shaky, but i agree not the worst on the pitch.  But with how our midfield got bowled over Sherwood's decision to play a young player who was over-matched in the middle seems like it could have been an easy fix.

I would also agree with Lennon and Siggy being the disappointments. Lennon with the poor game was unfortunate but honestly this was never going to be a match that played in his favor to do well.  Siggy starting was a mistake, he is very poor on the wing in general and on the wing against a team like City means he is being setup to fail, and as it turns out he did so.

Bentaleb may be catching the heat but i think more people are unhappy with our tactical choices overall and Bentaleb is the easiest one to highlight. "

Never been kissed, asked out, still a virgin, never in a relationship of any kind.

Why I think I'm FA... I'm not very attractive physically, I don't like to try new things and I like staying home all day playing games or programming. Oh and I have a crippling shyness, I can continue a conversation if a woman talks to me but I can't talk first. Another thing is that I don't have any opportunities, no friends to ask out and I won't get far by asking out random people. I don't even drink, so I can't ""get wasted and have fun"". It's not like I have any standards, my only real standard is to find a girl whose standards I fit into.

Hope? Well, I am still hopeful until I hit 25. I wouldn't say I have hope now, because nothing is changing and there are not even hints of anything changing, but it's not like I'm 100% sure nothing will happen. There is always that one in a million possibility that some girl asks me out out of nowhere and hopefully I can catch up from there.

How do I cope with my FA-ness? Getting online friends and then meeting them in real life. It's costly but I get to travel some and it gives me an opportunity to spend some time 1vs1 with a girl without the whole dating/flirting complication.

skgoa,AskHistorians,1391088676.0,"While a nice point about changing languages, this is completely untrue when said in reference to Greece. 

Ancient Greek is taught in school, it's just not the language that is spoken on the street. Many words remain *in active use*, though obviously there are also many new words and the grammar has changed a bit. The current Modern Greek has been codified as such only in 1976, before that it was considered vernacular. While I doubt that they would have an easy time communicating with any sophistication, a greek preson brought up in modern Greece will have a much better chance of understanding Aristotle than the person in Italy has at his respective task. 

Also Pontic Greek is spoken in isolated communities in modern day Turkey. It's very simmilar to Ancient Greek."

Oh I am sure you are a bastion of equal rights. Stop playing this game. I've your tired argument before. People like you love to pretend that no inequality exists as a pretext to make racist claims. Stop trying to turn it on me. I've seen this technique before. It's dishonest and unscientific, troll. I'm still waiting for your evidence to refute mine. I am still waiting to see the scientific proof that American are losing rights everyday. Oh., that's right, when it comes to facts and not political grandiose speeches based on hunches, racism and conspiracy theories, the subject is changed.

&gt; And I'm not listing the rights we have collectively lost in the past 50 years for you - you should be painfully aware yourself.

How convenient. When asked for proof you turn the burden on me. And then claim the evidence is self-evident? That is the lames excuse. You clearly believe something without evidence and want others to do the same. Why do you believe things without proof? Like I said, that belongs in /r/conspiracy. You clearly have no evidence to support your claim, but you want other Americans to base their political decisions on a fear even you cannot provide evidence for. I've heard your argument before. They aren.t original. I didn't ask for a flowery speech, I asked for evidence. You live comfortably in a free country, and cannot stand that you have to share this freedom with people you dislike or are afraid of. Plain and simple. So you claim that any equality they get to enjoy is taken away from you. How? Proof, not flowery fist-pounding speeches."

What I recommend is kind of going off a gut feeling so please ignore me if something more credible contradicts anything I say here.

Osteoporosis and hypocalcemia are major concern for the deteriorated elderly and are induced primarily from lack of mobility and weightbearing on the bones. Walking, ROM exercises, maybe swimming if they have pain (though I would imagine the bouyancy would remove the benefits of weightbearing on the bones). I imagine Vit D would be good for the elderly, too (you need Vit D to use Calcium). Kinda skipped the elderly section when I was looking at the examine.com page for myself.

I would definitely recommend some upper back and stretching/yoga into whatever you do. Deteriorated elderly people that I work with have terrible ROM and often live with severe kyphosis. I imagine some posture work could go a long way.

Bodyweight exercises for functional living would be a good, slow start. Maybe something like squats with no weight. If she is really limited already, maybe just practicing sitting down and getting up, lifting her knees up while standing on one foot, etc.

How self-dependent is she right now? Can she manage all her Activities of Daily Living on her own or doesn't someone need to help her? Can she still climb into a tub or does she use a shower? Difficulties getting into high vehicles like a jeep or SUV? Does she do her own shopping?"

illaqueable,medicine,1391090513.0,"It's a restriction imposed on trained professionals by other trained professionals. There is *no other business* that so directly holds the lives of its customers in its hands, and the requirement for certification is one that no rational human being would dismiss as a ""restriction of labor"". This is not hedge fund wrangling--it's medicine. It is intensely intimate and personal, and is appropriately handled in a different way than other businesses.

There is no simple answer to your question, but the simplest explanation is that patient hand-off is where critical--sometimes fatal--errors are made. The buzzword in modern medicine is ""continuity of care""; electronic medical records are intended to make the hand-off period less error-prone, but as with any system designed by humans, it has not completely eliminated the problem and likely will not.

So no, it is not strictly necessary for one surgeon to work 24 hour shifts, but let's say the surgery lasts 8 hours and the step-down takes 24-36 hours: I--and I'm sure our surgeon friend up above would agree--would not feel comfortable tossing my surgical gown in the garbage and clocking out without some idea of how my patient was doing. Now imagine that surgeons have not just 1 patient, but half a dozen or perhaps 10 patients, and their intimate knowledge (literally *specific to a given patient's internal organs*) allows them to be a step ahead if something goes wrong, or to direct other people in the step-down team as to various idiosyncrasies with each individual case. Yea, I can see it. I can see working 72 hours straight. "

aDDnTN,Tennessee,1391090889.0,"My wife went to Maryville after living in Houston for a long time. We got married on campus almost two years ago. I also work with a guy who's nephew plays on the team.


Pm me and I will see if I can get them to tell you about it some.

Also, you might want to ask some specific questions here and I will do my best to get them answered.

""Tell me about this school"" is kind of ambiguous, but here goes.

Maryville, Tn (pronounced mur-vul, LEARN THIS NOW) is right at the foothills of the Smokey mountains. It is a small town, very conservative on the surface, but everyone is in everyone else's business even though it's fairly populous. It's very close to the local airport. Knoxville (home of the vols, my alma mater) is pretty close, about 20 mins north. 

East TN has a special type of southerner, very polite and actually conservative, but strongly in support of helping their fellows or jumping in and putting a shoulder into it just to help the work go faster. They also have a different dialect than the typical ""southern"" accent. I find it to be endearing, but I'm biased. People will be courteous by nature, but one would be wise not to assume everyone there is an easy mark or uneducated simpleton and treat others with the same respect they demand.

College wise, the student body is very tightly connected and nature oriented (not in my wife's case, lol). There will be team building exercises and plenty of opportunity to take advantage of all the very close hiking, boating, rafting, camping, etc. Living in dorms for all 4 years is most common. Good food (they catered our wedding). My wife tells me that everyone was usually invited to any parties, even the fraternity parties (unofficial frats, btw). Fyi, they aren't a powerhouse football team and the student body doesn't really support their team, but maybe that's changed some, since they did so well last year. I guess you can tell that, since I understand MC didn't really have sports scholarships, but again maybe things changed.

Honestly, I feel that mc's small college atmosphere gives a better more personal experience than larger colleges, like utk. being 1:3000 vs 1:25000 

You will have friends for life in so many different paths and they have a lot of dual-degree programs that coordinate with many great universities.

Honestly speaking, I want too move back to blount county area when I get closer to retiring. for the other east tn'r's i'm leaning towards 6 mile area down montvale road or something by one of the lakes. 

Also, if you love motorcycling you are literally in one of the best parts of the world to enjoy it.

Please ask anything you want and I will try to answer. Go Scotts!"

I think back to the pre-iphone days on digg (yeah I was one of those guys in 06-07).

They don't overload you with ""coming soon"" statements, but their suppliers and coordinators are all leaking these juicy details and you can't help but speculate. If the iPhone and iPad pre-release hype is any indication; I think the iWatch is most definitely coming but it will underwhelm most critics upon release and then sell enough units to be something people really discuss.

There was this one guy, flag656 or something, who would pop up in every comment thread to talk about how Apple was stupid for trying to make a phone, and probably wouldn't, because it's such a difficult market and blah blah blah.

It's unfortunate that the shooting was a misunderstanding caused by the drunken boy, but I don't think it's fair to blame the homeowner. Even though he was shot in the back, the boy was not retreating, surrendering, or complying with the guy's commands. For all the man knew, the boy had a gun of his own and was waiting until he got hidden in the room to draw it. I still think we need the important detail of what is in that room.

dusmeyedin,AskReddit,1391091246.0,"I think a lot of the debate over abortion rights could be simplified if we treat a fetus or child as the legal possession of the adult.

That way if an adult decides not to carry a fetus to term (have an abortion), they have merely destroyed one of their own possessions, with no legal repercussions. If an adult loses a fetus through neglect of a third party (eg that controversial case where a woman lost her baby in a traffic accident) they may still claim damages as though they had lost valued property.

We already treat children as ""legal minors"" anyway, restricting their ability to drive vehicles, vote, drink alcohol, and sign enforceable contracts. I don't think it's all that much of a stretch to define a fetus as having fewer rights than an adult human either."

[A very brief entry on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation)

Anyway, to quickly summarize just a couple issues.  When I say 1/2/2014, what day is it?  Or, what is 1.004 larger or smaller than the number 1000?  These sound like simple issues until you realize that another programmer was reading in those values from a file without taking into consideration the file locale (i.e. it's generated by your customer).  Or you get some word in English that's 3 characters long and in German or Russian is 10+ characters long, which is fine, until you realize that you don't have enough space, for the new word and now have to rework part of the GUI.  Or a flow control of a program for people who expect to go right to left or top to bottom instead of left to right.  Even the word itself might need to be taken into context.  If I have a button with the word ""Bank"" on it, what translation needs to be sent back?  Even time can be sometimes confusing, because there are more than 24 time zones.

And, unfortunately from the programmer perspective, when you're on a tight deadline, while you might be told to keep localization into mind, it becomes very easy to leave a word in the program, because it's much easier to read ""Color = Red"" vs. ""Color=Namespace.ResourceFile.ColorRed"".

There are reasons why there are companies who focus only on localizing software, and it's not necessarily cheap.  The goal is to have a PM who understands these issues, but often I've landed with PMs who think that we can have a Spanish translation by next week, or that now that Spanish is done, the hard work surely must be finished, so German should only take a day."

The student who does the work must talk through the problem.  At each step, the student needs to ask, ""Is this correct?"".  The coach can say, ""Yes, that's correct"" or ""No, do it like this,"" to correct a problem.  They can also throw in words of encouragement.  

A:  Our problem is 4*4+7*3-8, is this correct?  
B:  Yes, this is correct.  
A:  We need to remember the order.  We have to multiply the numbers that multiply before we add or subtract.  Is this correct?  
B.  Yes, this is correct.  
A:  So the problem is (4*4)+(7*3)-8, is this correct?
B:  Yes, this is correct.  
A:  So if I multiply 4*4, I get 16.  Is this correct?  
B:  Yes, this is correct.  
A:  If I multiply 7*3, I get 20, is this correct?  
B:  No, this is not correct.  7*3 is 21.

Plus, that kid who doesn't get it, does get to coach and to feel strength in helping someone correctly solve the problem.  "

dusmeyedin,AskReddit,1391092245.0,"I think Hitler and Nazi Germany are grossly exaggerated in the social consciousness as a ""worthy foe"", when in reality their economy was inept, their military might was unsustainable, and their misrule would have likely led to a failed state and total collapse even quicker than the Communist experiment.

People talk about the Third Reich as a depraved leadership, which I agree with. But they also talk about it as though it were some monolithic, efficiently-run, engine of world conquest, from which the West swooped in to save humanity. In real terms, the German economy never even matched Allied production in any one field, and even before hostilities broke out they were continuously unable to address inflation problems or consumer goods shortages. Their racist ideology only served to further isolate them and deceive their citizens briefly that their social problems were somebody else's fault.

If the Allies hadn't overthrown the Nazi regime through force, the wheels would likely have come off on their own anyway. The similar autocratic Communist experiment lasted much longer and claimed many more lives... But because we could see the rot in the system, we don't romanticize the enemy - unlike the Nazis, whom we ended by force.

Nazism is like a gun-toting, fighting-age bandit whom the sheriff had to cut down in his prime. Communism is like the bandit who lived to old age, and the entire town can see his toothless gums. In the aggregate, Communism was a far more terrible foe and far more accomplished rival (space race milestones come to mind), but people only remember Nazism as the brash young ideology that they had to topple through force, at a high cost to their own servicemen."

On 6th I have a pair of Walmart events, a bunch of torchics, and these shinies (IVs are in the right places unless otherwise stated): 5 iv Jolly, Guts Larvitar, 5 iv Adamant Tyrunt, 4 iv Brave honedge (-sp atk, 4 speed IV), 4 iv Timid protean Froakie (-atk, -def), 4 iv adamant Growlithe (-def, -sp atk), 5 iv timid Rotom (-sp atk), 5 iv timid Eevee (-sp atk), 4 iv Adamant big pecks Fletchling (-sp atk, - speed). Of these, I think Eevee and Fletchling are the only nicknameable ones. I really have crap shinies on 6th :/

Renner1,OneY,1391092949.0,"&gt; Really? Your friends girlfriend? You'd put a single instance of fucking above someone's trust, support and friendship? If a friend's SO came to me and suggested it I'd be outraged! 

I didn't mean in the context of supporting infidelity. I should have specified that I meant if the relationship that already exists didn't exist.

A whole other situation entirely.

&gt; But I know some extremely beautiful people and hypothetically we could have sex. But we don't, we're just friends. And both of us are fine with that. I enjoy their company and it's not weird, they come round for dinner or we go for cocktails or whatever... 



Herein is the difference. With me, the sexual aspect is always going to be there, even if it's just in a ""what-if"" sort of way. To be honest it applies regarding any decently or very attractive woman that I see, and it's not as though I have this idea that I'm going to actually be able to screw them, or even have some period of consistent success regarding getting with people in general.

Doesn't mean that I'm obsessed with sex, either-- I have to say that there are plenty of other things that are important to my mind that override the ""get with girls"" mentality, especially in terms of certain issues or positions I might hold.

If some pro-Israeli comes to me explicitly offering sex, for example, the odds are I'm going to turn it down regardless of how good looking that person is.

&gt; Sex doesn't have to enter into it even if they are really attractive and you can hypothetically imagine fucking them.

I don't see having some idea or ideal or fantasy about getting with someone you're friends with or associate with who's really attractive as the same as wanting to be around them because you want to actively pursue getting with them."

GRRM definitely knew some people would guess the twist but if it wasn't for the internet very few people would have been able to guess it.

Not only because it means you need to practice many hours every day, but also because it's a sport dominated by young people with fast reflexes. This means that if you're serious about doing this, you will need the support of your family to achieve it.

Find out what *exactly* you would have to do to become a professional player. Make sure to gather every piece of info - how you plan to cover travel expenses, what the longevity of the career is, any future prospects after you're too old to play (there are hardly any pro players in their late 20s, never mind 30s), whether or not you can go to college, salary prospects, health insurance? etc. etc. *Then* you can sit your dad down and explain to him how important this is to you. Make sure to listen to what he has to say as well.

This adds nothing to the discussion. 

&gt;Here's a start on rights we've all lost:

Nope, I don't see rights being lost on a daily basis. Bullshit still stands.

&gt; several states have passed laws that prohibit firearms that are ""in common use."" Given that many states have firearms laws that are not in alignment with the second amendment (you know, supreme law of the land, amendment número dos) to the point they have been found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court (DC v. Heller) this is a blatant conditional rights violation I can think of with minimal brain effort. Would you like another example spoon fed to you?

Oh wow, one example of a unconstitutional law that cna be overturned. My god the tyranny. Ouch my rights. And how did this hurt any American? Is life less worth living? Lots of states make stupid laws. I bet you have no problem with  states that prohibited same sex marriage. As long as they don't touch your guns? Right? Instill await proof that you literally lost a right and only a daily basis. One shitty example does not tyranny make.

&gt;And how about we turn this ""I place the burden on proof on you! No you!"" game that you enjoy so much and conversely tell me also how these rights infringements I will list for you (like a school kid) AREN'T rights infringements?

Again bullshit. You didn't win anything because you have no rights being lost. You have never lost anything in this country and never will. You are just upset because no one else believes in your delusions. You didn't offer me any good proof that Americans have lost anything any on a daily basis. Try facts dipshit.

WideFoot,INTP,1391094539.0,"I have this problem all the time.  Tasks like learning a language or exercising are perpetual.  So, as soon as we see that we could do these things really well, actually doing them becomes unimportant and we move on to the next challenge.

I'd try doing things in which you can't know how well you've done until a definitive moment at the end of the project.  Try building an engine or designing a model rocket.  You can't know how well you'll do at this until you try to turn the engine on or launch the rocket.  You keep the mystery all the way through, and it can actually be invigorating to discover a failure.   

You mentioned writing; not being able to finish a book or maintain a blog.  For me it's 3D modeling.  You've probably already found that you could potentially write a pretty good book or be a decent blogger, so they don't interest you any more.  But, can you publish a book?  Change your goal.  Getting a book published is an entirely different beast than writing it.  Publishing involves going to publishing companies, hat in hand, trying to sell your story.  If you're a first-time writer, you need a manuscript for an editor to read and evaluate.  So, in order to learn if you could, potentially, publish a book, you have to have written a book to publish.  

I put all of my 3D models online and my goal is to have someone use one in some work that they do.  To my knowledge, I have only failed, so I have to keep working at it because I haven't proved to myself that I could, theoretically, do it.  

I'm not sure how you could apply this to more mundane, constant tasks.  I know that I can easily do all of the day-to-day things like getting to work on time, paying bills, exercising, so I'm not really interested.  I'd rather sleep in, daydream, or learn something.  I have to force myself to do a lot of them, which is miserable.  "

ciov3r,Paleo,1391094804.0,"For specification: The Paleo diet is based on pre-agriculture hunter-gatherer societies, and supposedly the diet of humans in the Paleolithic era. It is meant to be an omnivorous diet, excluding highly processed foods, high carb foods, and certain other items such as legumes and potatoes. 

It's essentially a 'real foods'/'whole foods' diet, with a few more restrictions such as the potatoes. The restrictions are helpful to those with insulin resistance, and focuses on intake of vegetables and fruits that are lower GI and packed with more vitamins-to-serving than some other ok but not as good vegetables/fruits. 

Dairy is difficult for lots of people to process- it's a common intolerance. It certainly isn't a natural part of any adult animal's diet. Either reason is fine for avoiding it. 

As with any diet- moderation and education about what you're eating is important. I see ""paleo"" recipes all over the place that are packed with bacon and other high salt cured meats. Obviously, someone who eats lean chicken/fish is going to be healthier than someone who eats tons of red meat. 
The KIND of meat you're consuming is going to matter. A serving of red meat every single day increases heart attack potential by 18%. Daily serving of processed meats such as bacon/hot dogs/etc by 20%. Subbing fish for red meat decreases that percentage by 7%, and chicken decreases it by 14%. [Source: Harvard Study] (http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mens_Health_Watch/2012/June/cutting-red-meat-for-a-longer-life).

Paleo isn't meant to be meat only- it's supposed to be a balanced, natural diet that supports protein AND veggies, instead of forcing you to cut out animal sources of proteins like other whole food diets might do. It's approximately recommended that half of your food source be from meat- that may be higher than other diets, I'm honestly not sure. It's not a 90% meat/10% other sort of thing though."

mycroftar,AskScienceDiscussion,1391094996.0,"No.  It's just a **really** simple idea.

Stars release energy.  They release a lot of energy.  We get enough of it here on earth, to support all life on earth.  But we get only a tiny percentage of our sun's energy - the rest goes off into space, lost.  What if we want to expand beyond earth?  That takes a lot of energy.  And even just staying on earth, our power consumption as a species is going up very quickly.

How could we capture all the lost energy from our star?

Surround the sun in solar panels.  And bam, that's a dyson sphere.  Any sentient life that starts exploring space will come up with this idea.  It is basic, it is simple, it is an easy way to get as much energy as possible from a star.

Is it the original battery? More than likely you need a new battery, but it could also be the security system inhibiting the starter. When you disconnected the battery the first time it activated the alarm system. Since your fob doesn't work you don't have any way to deactivate it.

alsomahler,Bitcoin,1391095361.0,"&gt; All inputs of a transaction are unrelated

Actually, if that person uses an offline wallet, it is more likely that they are related and means you now know more about the amount of bitcoin this person controlled. If you are able to figure out what they bought, you now now more about the contents of their wallet.

If somebody does a tumble or a coinjoin, you have no idea where the money went... unless there is a single output somewhere equal to all the inputs which you know came from that wallet.

Statistical analysis is not just about following the addresses, but also about amounts, times when they were and were not used.

If there is a transaction made from an address when the suspected owner isn't behind a computer or smartphone, you can practically rule them out as the person that controls that address.

When you send $3000 worth of bitcoin in a transaction for somebody and this person starts spending from this address for coffee, overstock items and groceries... simply by looking at the blockchain you can already make an educated guess which amounts are being spent and which amounts stay in control of that person."

There shouldn't be any,  ""I don't wanna waste my money""

This means you don't *really* want to quit. You may want to be healthier, and you may want to stop spending so much money, but if you think these things   that means that you don't want to stop smoking.

My appointment was an hour and a half and I didn't feel rushed at all.

I watch a lot of Say Yes To The Dress plus I'm super emotional and cry at commercials so I was convinced that I'd cry when I found 'the dress' but I didn't. What did happen though, is my smile was bigger and I started dancing around to the music that was on in the shop. My group and the shop owner all mentioned how my whole mood seemed to change the second I came out in that dress. Don't think that it isn't the dress just because you don't cry.

I believe it's avoided in Paleo because it isn't really a strictly *natural* part of our diet- obviously, from a biological standpoint, dairy is part of the process of bearing offspring. Not that people don't enjoy it, and again, as long as you're aware of and educated about what you're eating and where it comes from, I'm all for it. :)

Personally, I've been happy changing to almond milk for my coffee and such, and didn't use dairy much outside of that. I still enjoy small amounts of Parmesan now and then. So, you know, moderation.  "

Xilliah,dayz,1391096326.0,"In the mod I stalked a guy with a tractor for ages. Finally he got off and started looting a farm. Then he got caught up in some zombies. I took the chance to steal his tractor and drove off. He of course heard it and ran after me for a loooong time. It's a tractor after all and very slow. He would occasionally fire off a shot at me. Eventually I got tired of it and parked in a meadow and hid behind the tractor with my shotgun. IIRC it fired slugs which were quite long range and powerful. Any way I got him from a long range and took his stuff. I was pretty happy about my ability to stalk him, make sure he was alone, get his tractor at the right moment, and shooting him in the end. Then he rolled back the server. Arschloch!"
Drabby,AskReddit,1391096341.0,"Part of the reason is that despite the safeguards already in place, we still have frequent incidents where an adopted family is discovered to be neglecting and/or abusing the adoptee, sometimes to the point of death. The government and agencies in charge of adoptions have a responsibility not to deliver children into abusive situations. Unfortunately, despite the exhaustive vetting process and the barriers to entry they still seem to be doing a pretty lousy job of finding appropriate families. The problem increases greatly when the adoptee is older and/or disabled and/or emotionally troubled. Few people have any interest in adopting these children, and their issues require heroic patience and experience to manage well. Even people who are well-meaning can easily get in over their head.

My controversial opinion is that natural childbirth should be better regulated, not that adoption should be less regulated. Mandatory birth control for everyone until you pass an intensive parenting course!"

fronteir,soccer,1391096347.0,"Ok well I may have gotten a bit heated last night but I was pretty tired so for that I sincerely apologize. 

I'm still not convinced of that argument, as length of time being a fan =\= how dedicated/""good"" a fan you are. Yes, we might not have been fans for as long due to professional footballs (just for you ;) rising popularity, but saying that we're going to stop following after x years if there's a bad year is pretty cynical. Just because it's a new girlfriend doesn't mean we can't be madly in love with her.

A few years ago I was so clueless about the sport I'm almost ashamed to admit. I played when I was younger but outside of arsenal, Man U, Chelsea, real, barca, and Bayern, and of course the World Cup, I didn't know any teams or players. But after being introduced to friends who were interested in the professional sport, I got hooked. I ended up choosing Dortmund due to reasons like 9 is my favorite number (founded in 1909), black and yellow are my favorite colors, and you'll never walk alone holds a special meaning to me (which we adopted after playing Liverpool in the mid 1900s and seeing how powerful/moving it could be). After picking my team, I read up on everything I could, watched historical matches (97 CL final with Juve), what happened during the financial crisis of the mid 2000s, and now I keep up with all rumors, stories, watch friendlies, learn chants (I've started learning German as well!), be an official member/supporter of the club and basically do everything I can to be a part of the club. Sure I haven't stood on the Südtribüne jumping and shouting my heart out, but the day I get a chance to, I think I might actually cry. You're very fortunate to have grown up in a place where these fantastic football communities are, where people are all passionate about the game, seeing spurs fans and butting heads with them anytime a NLD comes around, but I can't choose where I was born, and for the moment, where I live, but damn it I am going to give to this club everything I possibly can. Which is where seeing attitudes on this site such as ""you're not as big of fans of the club as we are"" sucks. Plastic fans come from everywhere, and sure there probably is a bigger amount on this sub than you would see with your usual crew in the uk, and plastic fans suck. My friend says he's a Real Madrid fan but he pretty much only watches the clasicos and big CL matches, and doesn't even know if Real played Real Betis or Getafe(or know who those teams are) and I give him plenty grief about it. But grouping all Americans into this lesser category is wrong in my opinion. 

I'll reiterate my main point since I've rambled on at this point: you're married to Arsenal yes, but I've met this amazing girlfriend who's given me some of the most exciting and memorable moments the past few years, and I've fallen for her hard. Sure it's a long distance relationship but I keep up with her many hours a day and once I get that opportunity to see her, it might be the greatest day of my life. 

Length of time doesn't mean much in terms of how much you love the club, it shows more dedication sure, but there are plenty of guys who aren't dedicated to girlfriends. Luckily in this case it's pretty much a one way street in that the relationship is dependent on only your love, and for me I can see this fire burning for the rest of my life no matter where I live. I only can hope that this changes your mind somewhat about some of us yanks, and why it sucks to have our relationship looked down upon as lesser when we're doing the best we can.

And for your last point, being a New Yorker is the same as just saying you're a north Londoner, you do actually have to live there to qualify yourself. I'm as much a New Yorker as you are! But in my humble opinion, this doesn't apply to football clubs. I hope you have gotten some insight to what it's like to really love a club from across the ocean. "

Perhaps knowing that at least one person learned from his innocent, yet fatal mistake will provide some small respite from sorrow.

Buy Ghost Iron Ore on the AH, prospect it, either transmute the green gems to blue to cut, or use them to craft jewelry to disenchant or sell to vendor, cut the blue gems and post them, xmute to primal diamonds if they sell well and you have the cuts that sell. If you make rings/necks with the green gems, disenchant them and use the resulting materials to craft enchants that sell, and post those. To find out if/how profitable this is, check out Phat Lewts post [Shuffling and you](http://www.phatlewtsgold.net/2013/10/shuffling-and-you.html).

When you drop mining, pick up inscription. It's EASY and cheap to level, use the guide at [WoW-Professions](http://www.wow-professions.com). Each ""level"" of ink should have some cheap choice of herbs you can use since there are multiple options per level.

Download TSM2 and learn to use it. Check out Phatlewts tutorial videos [Video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEboxB-WEog) - they're excellent and will teach you the basics.

On your JC - make sure you are doing both the serpent's eyes and the gem research, you want to use blue gems for research every day, once you learn all the blue recipes it will start to give you random ones and blues are by far the cheapest. 

* Make sure you are xmuting living steel every day (I recommend xmute spec because of this and blue/meta gem xmutes)

* Use the disenchant search through TSM2 - it's really good and you can make plenty of easy gold just by buying things well under their disenchant value, destroying them and posting the mats. 

* Use the TSM2 destroy search option, search for ""Sha Crystal"". many people post level 90 epics for cheaper than the price of a sha crystal. Buy these and disenchant them, then post the sha crystals or use them to make enchants. Sometimes you make out even more due to the chance to get 2x Sha Crystal when disenchanting

Not long at all. Riddick tends to be pretty easy to find.

&gt;Could Riddick escape from Fett if he got caught?

Depends. If Boba managed to restrain him with something like Carbonite, he's down for the count. If he's just tied up, he'll escape.

&gt;How long would it take for Fett to decide bringing him alive wasn't worth it, and go for a kill?

Probably too long. Boba is overconfident just like his father. He isn't used to facing anyone quite so competent as Riddick (he got eaten against Luke, and Riddick has a lot more experience than Luke, albeit not with TK).

&gt;Would Riddick be able to kill Boba if it came down to that/if he got the opportunity to go on the offensive?

If the fight gets into melee range, Boba has about a tenth of a second to kill Riddick (by shooting him) before Boba is dead. Even if his armor is impervious, Riddick could just wring his neck."

duggtodeath,offbeat,1391097397.0,"&gt; Because unlike you - I haven't fallen victim to the lock step of a party/political leaning narrative.

Yeah, because your political ideas were formed in a vacuum and were not inspired by anyone else. Dude, we are all informed by others.

&gt; I value all human rights for all humans - something you appear to have a glaringly lack of consistency in.

Why, because I didn't find you losing any rights? Why, because there is concrete evidence racism does exist an affects judgement? Why, because you have no proof that you or any American has lost any rights.

&gt; So here's a statement I love to say to freak out anti rights zealot types like you: I support concealed carry permit reciprocity law and gay marriage recognition reciprocity law in all states. I support a gay couples right to stand their ground and exercise their human right of self defense. How's that rub ya?

Anti-Rights? WTF does that even mean? Why would I take away rights while praising the ones I have? Zealot? Yeah, you aren't leaning in any direction at all. I do not support SYG laws for anyone because dead men tell no tales. It does not account for fairness, procedure, nor its is a replacement for the law. And with the evidence I shared, it is disproportionally used to murder minorities when we do not know the full extent of the incidents. Now were some of these victims truly going to hurt the gun-owner, absolutely! However, we can also see cases where it is unclear what a threat a person poses. You see? It permits me at anytime to declare that I am being threatened, define what I think it is, then blow someone away. You are trusting a random person to make that decision. You don't take into account bigotry, mental instability or anything else. I am perfectly fine with self-defense, I am not fine with someone going out and making trouble in order to claim self-defense. You don't get to be a dick and then defend yourself from trouble you caused when alternatives existed. Also, here is one for you. I have no problem with gun rights or gun ownership. In fact, I may own one in the future. HOW DOES THAT RUB YA? Stop thinking that everyone who disagrees with you wants to take your guns. That being said, we should exercise discretion over who gets them. If you wanted freedom from random violence, then make sure crazy people can't get their hands on them.

&gt; You also seem not only content in the cages being built around you - you appear to love and defend their construction and existence.

Dude this is a bullshit religious-style argument. You are making an appeal to ignorance. You are claiming that you have proof that rights are being stripped, when asked to present it, you just tell me its invisible. So then how did you get evidence of it? Thinking like that belongs in /r/conspiracy, my nigga.

&gt; So in your theme of defending blatantly obvious constitutional rights violations or claiming they don't exist - 

Again a bullshit argument. If it was a blatant violation, it would go to a higher court and be found unconstitutional. You are grasping at straws by finding minor cases and building a mountain out of them. Again, I ask you to give me evidence that you are losing anything. You are making excuses for what you clearly can't present. Listen, you live a good life, in a free country. Stop with the persecution complex. Mexicans, blacks and liberals aren't trying to steal your kids and turn them socialist. Obama isn't coming for your guns, nor is some Jewish shadow government waiting to herd us into FEMA camps.

&gt; how would you defend these repeated right of privacy violations by the NSA and other alphabet fed agencies?

Who says I am defending them? The NSA are buffoons and there is no evidence their data collection schemes have successfully lead to preventing any sort of attack. They should be reigned in however and I hope the law clamps down on them. I hardly see your slippery slope to jackbooted thugs kicking down my door because I pirated Enders Game and downloaded an interracial porn AVI. Also, corporations violate your privacy every day. I bet you still use your iPhone and Facebook. Heck, even Reddit is free because we are the product.

&gt; Do you hate the 4th amendment as well as the 2nd?

Stop with the ""why do you hate America"" argument. It died in the Bush Jr. era and people only say it so they can make straw man arguments. Everyone that disagrees with your politics is not trying to overthrow America. Criticism of a policy is not rebellion. By your logic, if you criticize unfair gun laws, I could ask why you hate America. See how silly that sounds? The world isn't cut and dry, black and white. There are shades, and not every complex social issue is boiled down to YEA or NAY. There is no such thing as for us or against us. We do not live by inflexible absolutes. You should have learned that by now.

If you can afford a 2 ct ring and you are happy to spend the money on that, knowing that if it doesn't work out and you want to sell it back you will get maybe 1/4-1/2 of the money you spent on it, then do it. If you cannot afford this, tell her so. ""I do not want to screw up our future by spending that much money on a luxury item. I can afford to spend $X ."" Also, if you'd be ok with it, explore the idea of both of you paying for it. 

Personally, I wanted a large rock but we couldn't spend that kind of money on a diamond, nor did I want to, so I got a custom made setting and have a beautiful 1.8 ct moissanite. I also told my now-husband that ring shopping, getting married, etc. was happening now--we'd talked about it and I was not going to wait around for him.

mludd,AskMen,1391098388.0,"&gt; The thing people don't acknowledge is that most of the guys that want to get asked out are desperate and needy and not who you'd want to be with. The ones you fall for and approach, you fall for because they're confident and aren't desperate and are capable of saying no. The ones that you're actually attracted to are the monority that AREN'T desperate to be asked out (though they still probably appreciate it).

I feel like you're using the ""You're not a real man"" definition of ""needy"" and ""desperate"". You know, the one where a man should just shut up and deal with any problems he has, like a Real Man™.

There are plenty of guys who are quite capable of taking care of themselves, who are confident (but not cocky), who can get laid if they choose to go out and chase women et cetera who still think it would be nice if women put a bit more effort into pursuing men.

Also, my experience, which is of course highly anecdotal, is that most women **will** pursue a man if they think he's the best available option. The difference between men and women being that if a guy realizes that his #1 choice (at a glance, as in, just got to the party and noticed her) is out of reach (e.g. she's clearly interested in some other guy or several other guys are trying to hit on her) he'll move on to #2, then #3 and so on until no women who meet his standards are available while many women seem to go ""Huh, well, guess I'm done here"" after the first guy (when talking to female friends about this in the past the responses I got gave me the impression that most of them had a ""never settle for anything but the best"" attitude, which is kind of odd when you consider that the same women would then **settle** for the best available guy who approached them (as opposed to the second best out of all available guys))."

NahDudeFkThat,asktrp,1391098601.0,"Doesn't matter if he's great-looking. That doesn't mean he has access to normal or attractive girls. He is a either a high-valued Man or some low-valued dude, and I'm smelling the latter.  

Weird physical ""preferences"" are just a rationalization we come up with either when we see someone very attractive and they happen to have these traits, or when we can't score high quality poon so we make up things they're missing in order to hamster why we can't have them.

My favorite line guys around here in NYC use when they get rejected/they dont score: ""Nah, whatever bro, I only like em thick anyway..."" LOL

Ask anyone with a hair color preference (red-head lovers for example). You think that if some manly land-whale had red hair, she'd be more attractive to them than Kate Upton? Hell no man. Even if that girl was average, or mildly attractive, with red hair, ain't no way anyone is going to with her over Kate Upton.

Why? Because there **is** a universal ""code"" for female **physical** beauty. Strong indicators of good health &amp; reproductive fitness such as ideal Waist-hip ratio (.6 - .7 range), ideal BMI (17 - 21 range), facial symmetry &amp; structure, and overall fertility &amp; femininity (silky smooth &amp; clear skin, healthy hair, nice long nails, etc.) are the things Men's brain are hardwired to truly care for. The only scenario I can think of where a silly trait like hair color or skin tone or eye color or whatever would come into play would be when 2 girls are equally attractive but only one has that ONE trait you ""like"" over the other. And you'd have to have a gun to your head to truly choose. Otherwise, you'd go with both of them.  

On a serious note though. See a girl that hits ALL of these areas and I guarantee you won't care what color her hair is, or the color of her eyes, or the tone of her skin, etc. These traits' impact on a female's overall sex appeal is so minuscule it's irrelevant."

having sex is a choice (hopefully). when you have sex, you're automatically accepting the idea that even if you do everything right, you might get an STD or create a baby. so when you support this idea that the man can legally abort his child, these are the woman's options when she gets pregnant: get an abortion, give the child up for adoption, attempt to raise a child by herself. the man's options are: provide time and money to help raise the child he helped create, or walk away and pretend nothing happened. tell me

ScottyB6,IWantToLearn,1391098717.0," There are a few different ways of doing it. You can use a dehydrator, fans, or just heat from a lamp. A dehydrator actually slightly cooks the meat as it is set up to around 120*F or so. Some people prefer not to do it this way because of that. I like a dehydrator personally. Alton Brown shows to get 2 household air filers, something like 11x18 I would think. Asbestos and charcoal free of course. Lay the meat in the grooves of one filter and lay the other across it so the meat is in the little valleys of the filters and sandwiches between. Set the filters on a box fan and let it go to town for a day or so. I've never done it this way before. Another, but definitely not the last, is to just set it near a warm lamp. The Mexican store across the street from my house hangs pieces of meat over water pips near the ceiling right next to the fluorescent fixtures. Its gross and right out in the open so I wouldn't do it that way. My grandfather used to turn the oven light on and leave the oven off and dry his meat just by the heat of the oven with the door cracked. There are more ways to do it but those are the most common.

People have different preferences for meat but I prefer Eye Of Round. I get my cut 1/4"" thin WITH the grain, not across. I have them butcher freeze the meat slightly for about 30 minutes just to stiffen it up a little to give more even slices when they cut it. SLIGHTLY is key.  Others use flank steak or other similar flat meats and cut them into little strips. I personally like having a big ol' slab to chew on for a little while instead of tiny little piece, but YMMV so do whatever your hear pleases.

Recipes are endless. Be creative and do what you think will be tasty. Most common is teriyaki of course. My recipe is something like this...

*7lb meat

*2 cups teriyaki sauce

*1 tbs garlic powder

*1 capfull liquid smoke

*1-3 tbs fresh ground pepper

*a pinch or 2 of red pepper flakes

*1/2 tbs onion powder

*1-2 tbs honey

*a pinch of parsley and thyme

*possibly other things if I'm feeling dangerous.

Mix well and let it for 30 minutes to let flavors meld. add meat one strip at a time making sure to submerge the entire piece, every piece, in a large bowl. Depending on how long you are going to let it marinate you can either leave it on the counter or put it in the fridge, either way cover it. The salt in the teriyaki sauce with scare any bacteria away so don't worry about the meat going bad if you leave it on the counter for a few hours.. If I have the time I let it marinate overnight I will do so and start my dehydrator the following morning. It usually take 6-8 hours depending on how many times it gets opened and how much meat I'm drying.

You can use that or change it up however you prefer.

I'm sure I left stuff out so let me know if you have any questions. I'd be happy to answer them.

Oh and this is the dehydrator I have...

K2TheM,motorcycles,1391098799.0,"Asphalt that is commonly placed as the top layer for many residential streets has a ""softening"" point of ~100F. This means that once it's cured it can become pliable again if the ambient outside temps are at or above 100F. Kickstands on motorcycles have a very small footprint for the load they carry. This is to keep the stand small and compact, and it does the job 99% of the time. However, when you are propping up 400lbs of bike, there's a fair bit of force focused on a small area. So when it's hot outside (100F+) this causes the kickstand to sink into the road since the pavement is becoming less ""solid"".

You are not her priority. That sucks but it happens. It's a hen's night, not your wedding. She paid to travel to your getaway wedding--that's a huge fucking deal. So call her up and say ""X, I know you're busy--would you be ok if I asked G to help you plan the hen night so you have time to get your own shit done? You can work on ideas together and she can do the legwork because she has a bit more free time.""

And what effort does one need to put into these things? Most of the ones I have planned and/or attended have involved 1) get dinner somewhere nice with tasty drinks 2) dress bride up in stupid tiara and sash with buttons and other silly crap 3) call cabs and go get drunk and dance downtown 4) make lots of WOO sounds 5) crash at a hotel or someone's house and get very hungover brunch next morning. If she can pick a restaurant and get some cheap party crap, the party is done! What else do you want from her?"

Tokyocheesesteak,AskReddit,1391099189.0,"I quit cold turkey, but whenever I tried quitting suddenly, I could not handle it so I relapsed quickly. It only worked when I started quitting gradually, first conditioning myself to realize that I'm not even enjoying the smokes but am rather doing it out of habit, then by slowly changing this habit by cutting out one ritual cigarette after another (e.g. smoking on the way to the car, on the way home from work, on lunch break, etc). Several days would pass before I would cut out another habitual cigarette. I toughed out each of these habit cuts by thinking about how pleasant the next ritual cigarette would feel. One Monday, after I whittled my habit to half a cigarette a day (I was smoking half-cigarettes for over a month at this point), I decided to go ahead and quit and see how long I'd last. My previous high scores, when I'd quit suddenly, would last a few days at best. This one has been running since last March. I still keep my last half a pack of Marlboro menthols in my drawer, along with a lighter, for easy access, just to rub it in my habit's face that there it is, I can smoke a boag any time I want, but I won't not because I choose not to.
I believe that, for most guilty pleasures, you're ready to start quitting on your own only when the ""guilty"" part eclipses the ""pleasure"" part. When I was quitting smoking, the first couple puffs made me go ""aaaaahh finally, the smokey goodness of relaxation"". Subsequent puffs made me think ""why am I doing this? I'm not even enjoying it. And I'm gonna feel crappier when I finish it, anyway. It's a stupid cancer stick."" At that point it pretty much ceased to be a pleasurable activity altogether."

Fluxxed0,spikes,1391099426.0,"I run the white-heavy side of the GW aggro deck, with 3x Spear of Heliod, 3x Scion of Vitu-Ghazi, 4x Advent, and no Boon Satyrs.  I have ~300 matches of experience with the deck between paper and MTGO.  I'll post my decklist on request, but I don't want to make this post five pages.  My list is more midrangey than the list in the article... I don't run any 1-drops, and I run a few Pacifisms and Ranger's Guiles to help me do business.

Scion of Vitu-Ghazi is the MVP of the deck, hands down.  Generally, there are two things you want to populate with Scion: Wurms and Birds.  Your ideal line is to drop an Advent during your opponent's combat step, eat one of his attackers, then untap and play Scion to populate the Wurm.  With that line, you're adding 15 power to the board in one turn (19 with a Spear in play).  Short of a Verdict or Elspeth, you're probably in a good position to win the game.

Why populate Birds?  Well, my version of GW is prone to ground stalls against decks like Big Boros (multiple Reckoners) or RG Monsters.  Against those decks, Bird tokens are your out.  Backed by a Spear, you're putting 4 power worth of creatures in the air, which those decks have a hard time dealing with.  If you have your Spear in play, those Bird tokens can also hold off Nightveil Specters.

Here's how the matchups look:

* RDW: You eat RDW for lunch.  You start dropping creatures they hate on turn 2, and you never stop.  Fleecemanes, Voices, Smiters, Wurms, and Scions are all big problems for red.  You probably board out your Scions for Unflinching Courage though.

* WWx:  Scion is killer in this match, because you need mono-colored creatures to beat Soldier of the Pantheon and Brave the Elements.  Scion gives you two mono-white creatures, and then you can populate either a Bird or a Wurm/Centaur to get a white or green creature as needed.  WWx usually can't block your Bird tokens, so you're ok to tie up the ground and then fly over them.  They're weak to a monstrous Unflinching Fleecemane also, but you have to play around Celestial Flare.

* Mono-U:  You have to be the beatdown.  Smiters and Speared Centaurs punch through Frostburn Weirds, but Voices are mostly dead in this matchup.  You aren't scared of Thassa because you exile her with Selesnya Charm as soon as she comes online.  Bident is the big problem in this matchup, so bring in Sundering Growths to handle it.  Scion is SO GOOD here... he eats Frostburn Weird, he can't be tapped down by Tidebinder, and he gives you another trampler or some much-needed air defense.  Fuckin' MVP.

* Mono-B:  Solid matchup for you.  I run 3x Ranger's Guile to protect my early drops against their targetted removal.  Lions/Centaurs and Smiters race Nightveil Spectre just fine.  Scion is also MVP here, because mono-B can't handle all his threats with their targetted removal.  Bird tokens are good fodder for Desecration if you don't draw a Charm.  Spear of Heliod does work in this matchup, because mono-B can't really swing into an active Spear with their Nightveils (if they do, kill the Spectre in the End Combat step, don't let them get to second main).  Underworld Connections is the huge problem here, bring in Sundering Growth for it.

* Esper Control:  Throw out a threat on turn 2 and apply pressure.  Ranger's Guile holds off a T3 Hero's Downfall.  Eventually they'll stabilize with a Verdict, after which you cast a Wurm or Selesnya Charm knight at EOT and continue attacking.  Voices are crazy good here, because they help you keep the pressure on after those Verdicts.  Scion is also great because he's a bad target for 1:1 removal... he basically forces your opponent to find a second Verdict.  Bird tokens help keep you safe from T6 Elsepth, because if your opponent drops Elspeth and wraths with her, your Birds kill Elspeth on your turn.  

* UW Control:  See above.  Your Voices are a little worse because they'll have Last Breath, but those Mistcutters in your sideboard get MUCH better.  I run 4x Smiter in the mainboard, and he shines in this matchup because UW tends to be more counter-heavy than other blue-based decks.  Scion is pretty good for the same reasons he's good with Esper.

* Big Green/RG Monsters:  You lose.  Their monsters are bigger than yours, and they have Garruk/Domri to draw faster than you.  Scion is fine, but your Bird tokens get eaten by Arbor Colossus.  "

Well wait, if it's truly murder just like killing a person, OK then if a mother hires someone to kill her child she would surely be convicted of a crime and put in jail. By making an exception for mothers of aborted fetuses you are in effect saying it's not murder. It's something different than murder...which is exactly what pro-choicers say in the first place.

EvanYork,TrueChristian,1391099831.0,"&gt; Yeah, God didn't intend for trees to marry and commit to one another. Not a sin. Bad argument.

It's not supposed to be a good argument.  The point was that, in the vague ways in which the ""similarities"" were given were actually meaningless and not ""strikingly similar"" as he claimed.

(Also, man-tree sex probably is some sort of sin)

&gt;Sin can be between a man and a women, or a father and a son. That doesn't make them hopelessly mismatched

I disagree.  Every (sinful) relationship is between ""hopelessly mismatched individuals,"" and most every human relationship is sinful.  People are hopelessly mismatched to other people.  It's just how it works.  All sinful sexual activity occurs between people who fundamentally just have something wrong in their relationship.  Is it hopeless?  No, but neither are homosexual relationships.  No matter what stance you take on the issue, it's more then possible for a homosexual couple to cease their activity and remain in a good relationship with each other.  No relationships are hopeless, but all of them are mismatched.

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1391099849.0,"So I think what you mean by ""terrorism"" is essentially irregular attacks on the Roman Army in different parts of the empire.  Besides not being precisely defined, ""terrorism"" often refers to attacks on civilian targets, which doesn't seem to be what you're asking about.

Anyway, my field of study involved lots of revolts against Rome.  These involved different issues, none of which I'd really call ""terrorism"".  The first was rioting--Josephus describes mass demonstration against Rome after incidents of some kind, which sometimes turned violent.  But the main form of violence was revolt.  While Josephus records a few small revolts from the early 1st century, there were three major Jewish revolts against Rome.  For the small ones, generally the rebels would be kind of peripheral, and eventually captured and executed.  

The first, the Great Jewish Revolt in 70, began with escalating incitement and attacks, until Jewish rebels defeated the Romans in open battle, leading to a long-term conflict.  This wasn't really terrorism--just a war, where one side doesn't quite have a stable government they're representing.  The result was as you'd probably expect for rebelling against Rome--Jerusalem fell, and many thousands of people were killed, and many more enslaved.  But this was more of a regular war than what we'd call terrorism.

The second was the Kitos War, in the early 2nd century.  This is closer to what you're describing--Jewish rebels killed large numbers of Roman citizens during the revolt.  Eventually the rebel leaders were executed.

The third was the Bar Kokhba revolt, in the 130's.  This, again, was more of a revolt (hence the name) than anything we'd call terrorism.  The rebels were killed during the rebels' ""last stand""."

I can't set tthings up in the kitchen how I'd like, leave my daughter bath toys in the tub like I would do so if I lived alone. 

And in my situation with working, I have a commute that measures about an hour and a quarter each way. On average I pour $400 a month between parking, gas, and ferry fare. Moving out would enable me to cut two thirds of cost just to commute, and two thirds of time. I would get more sleep, be able to spend more time with my daughter, and have the energy to take her to the park, or library, or whatever else. 

It'd be worth it to me to move out, even with an extra $20k year. "

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1391100854.0,"&gt;What he said is essentially not the correct answer, since I can't find any reference to the word estadounidense before 1900, thus, it must have a more recent origin, and there must be a reason for it.

I think you're under the impression that demonym shifts *must* be for a reason.  That isn't necessarily the case--language sometimes just changes, demonyms included.

In my area of study, tons of demonyms have shifted around like that, both for reasons and just because language changes.  It was common in the early 1900s to call Jews ""Hebrews"".  That *did* have ideological reasons, but the term falling out of favor didn't--it just lost currency.  It's still used in other languages, such as Russian, and Jewish organizations in the US still sometimes use it in their name.  Similarly, there's no discernible reason why ""Jewman"" never caught on widely--it just didn't, and it went out of style where it was used (Ireland, mostly).  And there's also no particular reason why *Yehudim* (cognate with ""Jews"") became the dominant Hebrew term for Jews, and why *yidden* did the same in Yiddish, even though cognates of ""Israel"" were more common historically in Hebrew (and still are used in those languages, just not as the primary term for ""Jews"").

Anyway, the point is that there isn't necessarily a reason why demonyms shift--sometimes they just do.  And if there is a reason, there's often no way of knowing without reading the minds of the first speakers to make the change.  So there doesn't have to be a reason for it--it could most certainly just have shifted over time."
Dabookitty,canada,1391100857.0,"&gt;""These people were dicks, please call them nonstop!""

Hmmm...the title of the post reads ""Give them a call and politely explain how wrong they are?""  Am I reading the OP's meaning wrong there?

From the website itself:
&gt;If you need someone to talk to about this, please call or email the following people: 

Again I am not seeing this ""These people were dicks, please call them nonstop!"" you are referring to.  I did read the article and even searched the page for these words, since I presume since you are quoting you must have got them from somewhere if not the OP's title for this thread.  But those words do not appear.

If you can not give factual information, don't bother posting.

&gt;So you read the part where they listed contact information, and called upon all readers of the article to call them up and yell at them, right?

Yes...the OP did not list any information, but the person who wrote the article.  They listed business contact information, which is all publically available.  All they had to do is list thier address and mention it was thier neighbours who complained...a short google search later...people would have had thier contact information, and probably even more.

&gt;Nice comeback, dude.

If stating facts are come backs to you...sure

&gt;You're an idiot.

Renner1,OneY,1391100964.0,"&gt; But the road is a million steps long,

I think where I am is fine, to be honest. At the most basic, I'm going to treat every functioning adult equally, unless they prove to me otherwise that they're not worthy of equal treatment.

Third wave feminists that act like hysterical, hypocritical little girls-- not entitled to equal treatment as an adult, because they clearly can't act like adults, and say and perpetuate stupid things and delusional theory.

Same goes for militant gays or lesbians or ""transpeople""-- if they go around with this huge attitude thing, and think that they can act in whatever manner and say whatever they want and no one can criticize them or say anything and anyone who disagrees with them is a ""homophobe"" or a ""bigot""-- not entitled to equal treatment as an adult, as far as I'm concerned.

I could give less of a shit what they decide they want to do in the bedroom, but I won't tolerate people treating me like some asshole because I don't want to be hit on by a man in drag or hear gays talking about their sexual preferences to all and sundry.

Militant LBGTs that express offensive or racist attitudes are especially bad, I find.

I could go on in this vein but those  are two examples in regard to exceptions in my ideal of having a mostly egalitarian outlook.

&gt; but isn't it good to get some reconnaissance so you know what to expect?

Sure, but in this case I know what to expect regarding their ""arguments"" and their rhetoric because it gets pushed around on the internet-- especially the internet-- in certain circles.

&gt; Keep reading dude - I read loads of different opinions and then I try to make a new one that's not one that I've read, but is supported by what I've read - hopefully by people that have actually lived the experience - but also change my mind when a good argument comes along, and then question the argument regularly once I agree with it and see if I do still agree - I get other people to challenge me on it and enjoy defending my position and enjoy them pointing out the bits I got wrong. 

I really don't see the worth in getting into some deep discussion with people who are actually perpetuating ridiculous ideas like ""rape culture"" or ""schrodinger's rapist"" or ""if you're not a feminist (second or third wave especially) then you must hate women"", and plenty of other ""points"" or pieces of rhetoric along those lines.

In regard to the sort of people who agree with jezebel and feministing and other trash websites like that.

I mean, they'll *immediately* accuse you of ""misogyny"" if you say you see no evidence of a ""patriarchy"" as defined by feminist theory ever existing. Or if you question or want to debate anything they say ever.

I have enough headaches already arguing with morons accusing me of being a ""dirty Arab-lover"" and ""anti semitic"" because I support Palestinians and am an Arabist. Enough pathetic accusations and worthless, baseless bullshit for my plate as it is."

wooq,pics,1391101313.0,"They are shorter lived, slower, smaller and weaker than tornadoes because they are formed from a completely different process.  Tornadoes form from horizontal mesocyclonic rotation in massive supercells being diverted earthward by updrafts, while waterspouts are merely vortices of wind that develop at the surface which are extended by updrafts into cumulus clouds.

A waterspout over land is not a tornado, but rather a landspout.  A tornado over water is a tornadic waterspout (still called a waterspout for the same reason that a copier might be called a xerox).

The funnels in both are composed of condensation due to the low pressure inside the vortex and have very little to do with the composition of the surface at their base.  Major perturbations in the surface (large changes in elevation, very large buildings) can interfere with the vortex, but the difference between flat land and water is insignificant."

Justvotingupordown,BSA,1391101933.0,"Hey, thanks for taking my throwaway comment so seriously! I have a follow up question:

&gt; It takes 7 Board of Reviews, 7 Scoutmaster conferences, and 7 times leader stating that the scout is living up to the Scout Oath and Law.

My question: **Isn't this just the same insular groups of people constantly re-evaluating the same person?** And wouldn't you agree that would inevitably lead to corruption? This is why we have juries, and an independent judiciary. This is why special prosecutors are appointed when certain people are under investigation. The bedrock of fairness is an *unbiased* decision-maker.

My point on this whole thread is that the Boy Scouts have built themselves a little world here without outside input, which is fine except for the fact that they want ""Eagle Scout"" to stand for something in the outside world. It's clear to me that the outside world doesn't have a say, so in my mind the position loses some serious prestige.

(As far as the high schooler/bad teacher example: I don't think anybody would think it was appropriate to punish the student for a lazy teacher, especially if the student had no knowledge of the laziness. Remember, the hypothetical OP proposed is that his brother (knowingly or intentionally) behaves in a way that is contrary to the Eagle Scout ""way."")"

nubosis,comicbooks,1391101967.0,"it reminds me of when a magazine, time or life or something, went to DC comics during the beginning of WW2 (before America was even involved), and asked how Superman would handle the situation. Their response was a comic where Superman flew to Germany, picked up Hitler, and flew him to a world court to go on trail. So Superman has done things like this before... the most recent example is in Earth 1 volume 2. Superman (and this is a young out of continuity Superman) helps a third world rebel faction get a one up on a dictator. But then there's the problem of what happens next. What if after overthrowing that dictator, the population just elects another dictator to punish another ethnic population. The US gets a lot of flack for trying to police the world that they have no right to police... how would Superman be any different? How many dictators or corrupt governments would he have to overthrow before he would just be micromanaging the world? And what right would he have to micro manage it? Wouldn't that make him the dictator like Zod or Darksied that he swears to fight? That's Superman's problem, and why he ends up having to protect the status quo. It's why Superman has to set an example in stead of use force in most situations, he has to show how power SHOULD be used in stead of always forcing his will. It he works outside of the law to commit justice, than what good is law? There would only be Superman's law, and that would be fascist. It's that difficult balance he walks that can make for some interesting stories."

Going back to it, what I'm saying is that $80 for a $30 cuban is just not a good idea.  Overpaying that much ""for the Cuban experience"" is also not a good idea, and it won't be inherently that much more amazing over a **similar** non-cuban cigar.

Also

No_Inside_Voice,AskReddit,1391102195.0,"The first time I quit cold turkey I made a big deal of it like I think a lot of people do.  At first it was great, having a lot of congrats and well done! thrown my way but after a few months those go away and I had no motivation left.  I was so concentrated on the number of days since my last cig and I think that hurt me.

The second time I straight up just didn't feel like having a cig one day.  I decided that was my time to quit.  I stopped paying so much attention to the date I quit and just took it one craving at a time.  I let myself have a cig at the bar if I was drunk etc. and didn't punish myself if I slipped up.  After a few months those random cigs started tasting like shit and made me feel terrible.

My bf then followed suit and we decided to start running.  The way your lungs feel after a run when you've smoked for 10 years.....that's what finally did it.  I didn't have high bp or cough a lot or any of the physical things people point to to get you to quit.  We rolled our own (another factor that I think helped us quit - not as many of the synthetic chemicals to intentionally hook you) so the money argument wasn't really there either.  But holy shit.....run a mile and see all the gunk come out of my lungs....that was a game changer.  

Fast forward 2.5 years we have run multiple half marathons, he's ran a full.  We're training for a half in April and a full later this year and we almost never have cravings.  It was also a motivator to eat better and pay attention to other health related issues.  It was a good chain reaction.

My advice to you: find something else to do with your hands that can be done in short increments (like the 5-7 mins you would spend smoking).  I had a friend that took up knitting and would knit for a few minutes any time she had a craving.  Most of all - stop punishing yourself for having cravings!!  Cigarettes literally change your brain chemistry.  You do not have low will power and you are not weak - your brain is literally producing less acetylcholine because of nicotine.  Good luck!"
PlushieChomby,AdviceAnimals,1391102197.0,"Yeah, situations like that, you don't have to worry about telling. I've known some sys admins for the local school districts here, and just visiting a site like that through the school network is more than enough to get canned. It's not just men, either. There was a woman who tried to sue the district for getting fired after they caught her looking at/searching for underage teen girl porn on her computer. She taught a girl's gym class, FFS. Her suit failed miserably of course, and while I didn't follow along on what happened to her because apparently it wasn't newsworthy, I can't imagine having that follow her around made her life any easier or gave her the chance to get a job working for another district elsewhere. She was just one case in a handful I heard about over beers and meals, but the end result was always immediate dismissal and a tarnished reputation. 

Then again, we live in silicon hills and technology is taken pretty seriously around here, whereas I'm fairly certain there are still a lot of districts in the nation that are understaffed, overwhelmed, undertrained or unprepared, so if you live in an area that suffers those qualities, I'm sure your colleague has a shot at possibly no one noticing, if they don't have enough people to keep track of the traffic.

If you feel you are overweight then maybe starting a gym routine can help out as well but honestly it depends on where you want to be and what you wish to achieve by looking a certain way or not. As commented above seems more like a confidence issue and honestly you'd be surprised by how many people who are in amazing shape think they are overweight or ugly as well. So I guess staying proactive on the things you can do to ""look"" better will help out somewhat but is not the answer. I think recognizing your strengths and working towards your goals can help far more and physical beauty is only one part of attraction honestly so even if you feel deficient, which you are not imo, realize there's more to it than just that for sure. Best of luck and imo working out is always a great start for any self improvement because of the discipline and positive mental and physical benefits that come with it for sure. Stay well.

LeeTaeRyeo,outhere,1391102422.0,"The chorale will definitely have a Baroque or Classical feel to it (mainly because that's what I study).

Each of the movements is intended to imitate a form of mediation. For example, the first movement is based on Vipassana meditation (mindfulness meditation). So, it starts out with only one voice part playing and adds more (dissonant) voices as time goes on, until the sopranos come in, when it changes to a consonant, tonal chorale. This is intended to imitate a mind filled with ""idle chatter"" eventually coming to a state of harmony and awareness, which is one of the goals of Vipassana meditation.

The second movement, which I'm working on at the moment, is intended to imitate Samatha meditation (concentration meditation). In this piece, only one voice is reciting the mantra at a time, while the other voices are providing an accompaniment on the syllable ""om"".

The third movement, which I'm going to start on this weekend, is based off of the practice of reciting a mantra. So, my idea is to write this movement like a fugue with the main theme being the traditional melody used to recite the mantra.

The other three movements will be based off of other types of meditations (e.g. walking meditation) as well. I don't have as solid of a plan for them yet, because I probably won't start on them until next week or the week after.

I'm trying to give myself a month to write all 6 movements. This is really my first attempt at a major composition, so it will probably not be all that great, but it's still progress. I'll take that!"

There has been a push to move all religion to the back burner so that different religions don't come to blows like a hundred years ago. But, this has been demonized by Evangelical Christians who share your view. 

&gt;How could any intellectually honest believer not put God over a manmade construct like a nation? 

There comes a point where non-believers and those of minority faiths have experienced enough violence that even a religious rhetoric begins to look like the beginning of the path to violence. 

Look at Syria. The Christian minority (8% of population) has thrown their lot in with Bashar al Assad. Why? Because they fear the violent revenge of the Sunni majority.

GhostsofDogma,CrappyDesign,1391102663.0,"I already took the entry level courses, as I understand it. This is Computer Graphics II; I already took design fundamentals and Computer Graphics I, and this is a requirement for any art major wishing to have their concentration in graphic design.

I would've figured that it was just supposed to be yet another ""Yes, I know how to use the selection tool"" class, but our first assignment is to make a logo for the local business she assigned us; one of them will be selected for actual use and she did a lot of talking about how it will be something to put in our portfolios.

How she feels she can say all of this while giving us no help except the first crappy '5 aspects of good design' article that came up in a google search, I do not know. 

Maybe it's just me, but I take a serious approach to everything I do- designing a logo to be graded on when I know fuckall except 'having at least the minimum amount of good taste necessary to even call yourself an artist' seems like a fool's errand to me. The aim with any assignment is to look at a novice's work and tell them how to improve, but doing it with no foundation at *all* seems like a waste of time. (Design Fundamentals did not cover this type of 'design.') I mean, I could do something like a sports team logo, but I'm at a loss as for what to do for a nondescript senior center. (e.g., I don't have any kind of concept to work with besides 'it's a senior center'. You know, designing a logo for Windows, you make something that echoes a literal window or technology or whatever have you, but there's not really anything here to work with so I'm just lost.)

I could, and am, obviously, trying to research it on my own, but it's frustrating to be paying for a class that isn't teaching you anything. Idk. Most things I find online are talking about gigantic companies or businesses which don't have the right aesthetic at all. I want it to be friendly to the kind of people that are going to use it. I've started studying logos for hospitals and whatnot, so I think I'm getting... closer?

I can't really take an independent study, but the reason why is a long story."

Avistew,sex,1391102668.0,"I agree with Kallisti_gold. If I'm not in the mood, sexual touch will turn me off more, then gradually disgust or scare me, and eventually make me not want to pursue sex with that person later even if I am horny.

Non-sexual touch, however, can arouse me if I'm not in the mood to begin with. I mean things like hugs and so on, that are not sexual, and (that part is important) not given with the intent of making me horny. It makes me feel loved and appreciated for who I am and not just as a vessel to jerk off into, and that makes me trust the person, which is a requirement for me to get horny.

So I have no clue if your girlfriend works like me, but you might want to be affectionate a lot, without trying to pressure her for sex. The more non-sexual contact you have, the more she can trust that you won't want to pressure her into sex every single time you show some affection, which should take some of the pressure off.

Since she's had past experiences of painful sex, it must be difficult for her to make herself vulnerable to you, even though she knows that rationally, you don't want to hurt her, and it won't her (her condition is better, right?), there is still the past memories there, so it's probably going to take a while. I would say, try to tell yourself there won't be sex for a while, and welcome it if it happens but do your best not to expect it, and to get your satisfaction from other sources until she feels better (by that I don't mean cheating on her, of course)."

ScottieWP,atheism,1391102676.0,"Good point. If you believe God is omnipotent and omniscient then he really is a huge dick. Why would God create Satan or allow him to come to power or tempt his perfect humans in the first place? So he allows this to happen, knowing it will lead to the eviction of Adam and Eve, punished Eve and women with terrible child birthing pains, etc. Then after a while he realizes that humaity is a lost cause (but he should have known forever, omnipotent, right?) and decides to kill them with a flood. In the process, he kills every other animal on Earth (apparently they were evil too). And I could go on...

fingers-crossed,electronic_cigarette,1391103194.0,"I had worked at one for about a week - week and a half and helped them open up, set up the shop, etc. The guys starting it didn't know jack shit about vaping, so myself and one of the other guys they hired taught them a lot about the products they were going to carry and hoped to carry. I worked 2 days that the store was actually open for business and never heard from them again, so either they didn't like me for some reason and never let me know/try to correct the problem, or more likely they just used me and the other new guy to learn about shit and then let us go so they wouldn't have to pay us. I don't know if their prices have since changed, but their shit was super expensive. They were selling those K100 kits with the shit batteries for like $85, ego twist kits for like $90, MVP 1 for like $70, etc. In the end I'm glad it didn't work out because it would be hard for me to sell those products at those prices with confidence.

Fast forward a few months, a friend of mine posts on Facebook that his shop (there are 4 of this one in the area) is hiring, so I talked with him and now I'm finishing up training there and I can already tell it's way better. Prices are more reasonable and the people that work there are all pretty down to earth. 

My #1 job is customer service, finding out what the customer needs and wants and helping them satisfy that. So I explain our different devices, set people up to test juice, help them rebuild/teach if they want to learn and explain battery safety, etc. When customers aren't in the store I organize, clean, rebuild my own stuff, practice rebuilding some of the stuff we carry that I'm not super familiar with, try some of the juices I don't know the flavor of off the top of my head. We're encouraged to vape a bit when customers walk in and show them our devices if they're interested.

Cyfun06,AdviceAnimals,1391103197.0,"Yes, I did see that video, but thanks for the link.  As someone who has driven many types of cars in many conditions, I completely understand their reasoning.  However, if my tires were to lose traction in a turn, I'd rather have my ass end hang out but still be able to steer, than have my front end plow forward and lose my turning and braking abilities.

Also, note that their tests were all done on a track with standing water.  So their reasoning only applies for the small fraction of time you're driving in extremely wet weather.  The rest of the time, you're gonna want more traction up front."
ikkleste,SquaredCircle,1391103199.0,"I'm losing faith. That's what's come out of this for me. They build all these guys with promise up, and when they don't immediately go over they feed them to Their Top Guys. Ryback, built up well, fed to Cena. Sandow, om nom Cena. Even Punks title reign took second billing to Cena all year.

Finally someone got there. Two years ago Bryan was fed to Sheamus, the Crowd at the IZOD literally said NO to this. They backed off on Bryan and built him up again with Hell No. We stuck with him. He got to the top, Cena put him over (admittedly as a place holder while he took a break). Where they finally going to add a new guy to the top slots, someone who got there through their own hard work? Someone who the crowd put there rather than the writers? A natural face who everyone loved? Nah feed him to Orton.

""It's a slow burn have faith"" people said, and I kept faith, as he was fed to Orton month on month. ""It's a slow burn have faith"" people said, as he was feuding with the cool but new (and not main event) Wyatts. ""Ah"" they said, ""they are holding off his win til Mania"" and I kept faith.

The Bryan Wyatt thing came to a head, and the timing was geared exactly right for him to pull double duty, get beaten down by the Wyatts, and come back through good old Babyface will power to enter the rumble. The story was written.

And then... well you know.

So yeah Big E, looks like he's bound for a solid push, Roman will get one too, Cody isn't new but his career has built over the past couple of years steadily to the top. But even if nothing screws up along the way, they'll get to the main event, and then get knocked right back down. And even if they make it through that. And climb back up again, with the crowd behind them in levels unseen for years... guess what...

I want to see these guys get chances at the top, I want to see them work their way up then get rewarded. But we won't. We'll see Cena, and Orton, and Batista apparently. Where was Batista's struggle to the main event of Mania XXX?

And that's what this mess says to me. All these promising guys, all this talent, won't be rewarded it'll be fed to guys who've already made it. Who've sat at the top table stale for ten years.

The build keeps happening and it goes nowhere. I thought maybe we'd finally seen that change. We hadn't."

ballookey,exjw,1391103267.0,"Ignore the downvotes! Reddit automatically or algorithmically applies downvotes. There is ZERO point in worrying about it.

The only way to know for sure someone actually gave you downvotes, is if your aggregate score fluctuates up and down. For example, your first link in the OP currently has 50 net upvotes. If that were to drop to 48, then you know someone legitimately downvoted it because generally the Reddit algorithm doesn't actually make a score go *down*, it only adds downvotes so that the exact number of upvotes is impossible to determine.

And yes, it's frustrating to see that happen and know that someone disagreed but didn't articulate their reason. But I can imagine there are instances where someone doesn't want to say because they don't want to start a disagreement, but they do feel strongly against what is said or the type of post. So fine, they exercised their ability to downvote. 

When a post has a score that's 50 positive, who gives a crap if a few people didn't like it?! Most DID!"

Sharkictus,ABCDesis,1391103484.0,"Honestly the big issue with homework is that there is no real material reward for it...jobs at least pay every two weeks. 

And even when I do it ahead of time, I end up finishing the exact same time I would if I started late...and results wise isn't different. This changed a bit now that I'm a Junior in College because the first time in several years, I am learning something completely new in a formal setting, but old habits die hard. 

The other issue is only recently has homework actually been of educational use to me. 

And I don't really have internalized racism. I think English is a pretty shit language too. Stupid language develops after Christianity, with the religion being the majority religion of the time and region decides that love is good catch all word, despite the massive goddamn variance, especially of importance in the religion itself. And the stupid  rules with more exceptions. That pretty much describes me. I don't really think anything is superior, I think things are slightly less shit than others in the regards that matter to me. English is the least shit because at least I can speak it. But it's still shit. Hell I celebrate 4th of July by saying yay to the least worst country in the world... 

But I dislike of non-English is more related to I don't like not knowing things. In fact I hate it. I don't like barriers to information. Has odd affect of me searching out spoilers, and the spoilers hype stuff up more for me...Hell one of my lotto fantasies is essentially majoring in everything. 

My parents are aware. They just are addicted to the damn shows. Like Saturday Morning Cartoons as kids level of attachment.

My main doubt would be on daily basis, although I think that tee and jeans are OK for almost everywhere (I've been in ~14 countries, haven't had any problem with my clothes), but I'm likely to buy some stuff ""local"". I think it'll be smart to dress and buy something regional...

DayZ is one of the first games that makes me feel conscious about killing people in a virtual world and have serious regret. If you have no clue what I'm talking about: I shit you not, I mean it. It gives me unique emotions I did not know before which is great art to me and is what makes this game so special. A moral game you could call it, like a moral theatre play on steroids since you are the actor. If you seriously don't feel bad about killing someone who just put 10-20 hours into his character I'm pressured to think you are a psychopath. I don't mean some fresh spawn, I mean someone who's all geared up and obviously careful and not in the mood to go weapons blazing. Yes it's funny and yes it's part of the game and yes I want you to do it. But don't tell me you don't feel a shred of regret? That would be pure griefing in my opinion, which is pathological behavior. In the end it is part of the game and part of the experience that we all can learn from. I personally love how I get thrown into situations where I don't have a choice but to shoot and have to accept that that's the truth. I honestly don't want to. In real life you can shrug that off and act as if it would never happen. And in my eyes it makes the good guys so much better and makes me appreciate the goodness in people so much more and it reminds me to look for that in everyone, even if they seem to be lying bastards sometimes.

Edit: Ok so I actually read his story now ( sorry about that ). I see what you mean, he treats it too seriously. If you torture someone in the game it's just fun and has no real bad consequences. I purely meant the aspect of killing."

The attitude is an consequence of their culture, something that takes decades to change in a meaningful way. The Middle East was a world center of commerce, the people might try to bargain themselves out of any situation. Flight instruction comes up again: I could tell them a technique needs work during a debrief, and they'll bring up something else... ANYTHING else, to win ego points back.

I did my placements and completely fucked them up in early season 3 and landed in Bronze 4 because I was a really new player and kind of sucked a lot. For the next 6 months I didn't play ranked and just focused on learning the game. I got a LOT better and finally decided I was sick of being Bronze and I was going to climb to Silver and then Gold. I went in to ranked and absolutely trashed everything the first two games, and the third game back I was forced to play support. (I main jungle.) Now I'm not a great support, but at this time I was much better than Bronze 4 level. Our ADC didn't know what last hitting was, but his 1v1 and teamfight mechanics weren't horrible. I started telling him what to do and he managed to get three kills in a row listening to my advice. From that point on the whole team started asking me what to do, and for the next 35 minutes I told them EXACTLY where they needed to go and what to do, and we finally managed to win. The point I'm making here is that if you give suggestions or make plays that consistently work, people will start listening to you.

Number 1. You have to REALLY want to quit. Don't just quit because you are suppose to or was told to or else you will cave in first smoke that is offered to you. Do it for yourself and want it for your health

2. Set a quit date. It's difficult to just up and quit but if you set a dye you can make sure you get all your packs finished and got your fill because the next step is the hardest.

3. DONT SMOKE! The best advice I could give and have done myself is remember that if you have a cigarette in your hand you have already lost. You can't quit smoking by bumming a drag or having the odd cigarette here and there. Some have done it but it is this lack of commitment that has caused most my friends to start smoking again. Some offers ALWAYS say no because if you want to quit that should be the only response. 

These steps worked for me and while I'm sure some people have slowly cut down I can say te majority of people on my experience CAN NOT manage that. If you want this then a smoke should not ever need to touch your hands again."

wooq,pics,1391104670.0,"Seems to be some confusion about different kinds of vortex...

Waterspout: winds caused by pressure differences blow over the surface of water.  Sometimes these winds meet and form a spinny bit of wind, like an eddy in a river.  Often when this happens over warm water, it is also accompanied by an updraft of warm air that keeps the vortex moving.  If this happens in the presence of a storm, they kind of get ""energized"" by the same pressure and temperature differences that created the storm so they persist and gain strength, merging with the storm, being powered by its winds.  The fast rotation produces low air pressure in the center, which causes water to condense out of the air, forming what appears to be a funnel.  This same process can cause a persistent vortex over dry land, which is sometimes called, logically, a landspout.  However it is much more common over warm water when a cold front is moving in.  Waterspouts rarely survive do much damage if they move onto land, as the forces that would drive them are much more perturbed over uneven land than flat ocean.

Tornado: Gigantic cumulonimbus stormclouds form where hot, moist air meets cool dry air (or sometimes warm moist air and hot dry air).  Sometimes, local differences in wind direction at different altitudes (wind shear) creates horizontal rotation (a mesocyclone) in the cloud.  This makes the storm have high winds and certain characteristics that classify it as a supercell.  Updrafts can cause the horizontal rotation to diverge into vertical rotation, and this is when you have the potential for tornadoes.  Tornadoes are the focal point of this rotation in the supercell.  Unlike waterspouts, the rotation is caused by forces from above, and it extends all the way up into the cloud, causing the top of the cloud to spread out in an ""anvil"" shape where the troposphere meets the stratosphere.  Confusingly, tornadoes that form over water are often called waterspouts, however a more accurate description would be to call it a tornadic waterspout.

Dust devil, firenado, etc.: Forms from a column of rising hot air being given rotation by local winds.

Gustnado: the supercell talked about above also has one or several strong downdrafts associated with it.  Sometimes these cold downdrafts also form a cyclone, which can create a gustnado."

In kindergarten they had me on a heart monitor for a day, and they had a ton of followup appointments over the years for made-up problems to keep up the ruse. I was a very healthy child and rarely got sick, but every few months I would be going to some medical office for ""your heart problem."" Blood tests, fat tests, heart monitors, I can't even name all the super specific shit that was done, the purposes for which I didn't know. They would regularly give me pills to manage this ""problem.""

Every time I was interested in some activity, they told me I shouldn't or can't so that I don't stress my heart. They put me in a soccer league for 5 on 5, small goals... because a regulation size field would involve too much running and make my heart explode or something.

2 years into college, they came clean. Lucky for me, the fear of a problem I never felt faded away during high-school and I did some crazy shit since then... no regrets.

Refs are human. The fans know that. The players know that. That means that officiating these games have a subjective element to it. Refs have to make a judgment call on every play.

If the players have to murder each other before a PI is called, that's fine...just make sure not to call any PIs until someone dies. The players and coaches should adjust accordingly. "

&gt;  The referee who reviewed the film for the Journal said officials are reluctant to throw flags for the same infringement more than once in a game. ""Technically, we're not supposed to referee that way,"" the referee said. ""But there's a human element that says: Do I really want to throw the same flag seven times today?""

&gt; Officials are also hesitant to litter the field with flags because the NFL's referee grading system, which determines which officials will be allocated to marquee games, downgrades referees more harshly for wrong calls than for making no call at all.

To me, this indicates that it's not just a problem with the ref's shitty officiating. I think it's a more systemic problem with the culture of the NFL - refs shouldn't have to worry about throwing the same penalty flag repeatedly throughout the game if that infraction is being committed repeatedly throughout the game."

In the case of a rare coin, it's rarity is based on the fact that it will never be minted again or that it is unique in some way (unique traits or limited production or near extinction.) None of these criteria apply to board games that have been printed within the last several years.

These games will most likely be reprinted in the near future and sold at or below MSRP once they do.

hylandw,DnD,1391105774.0,"Before I start off, I wasn't able to open your file (on an Ipad and it's a flash file) so I have no idea what you already have aside from your mention of a castle and a shore.

1 - Central city theme

You'll need a reason your city exists. Settlements exist because there's a source of money for the peasants. In real life, London, UK has trade along the Thames, NY, NY has trade along the shore of the Atlantic, and Sudbury, Canada has it's famous nickel mines. Castles exist to defend, and thus need a city before they can be built. They can either be a defensible place for nobles to live or they can be a place that defends the people.

Sample sources of income:

*Mines

*Water trade

*Fertile land

*Dense forests for wood and food

*Pre-existing crossroads, so land trade

2 - Basic layout

Every single town has a Main Street. It may have been renamed, but it's there. Start with a Main Street, then add an intersecting street. You now have a crossroads. As the city grows, you will begin to have more and more small streets that go off the two main roads. This is OK. Small streets are important. You will also have more heavily-used streets that go to major areas, like the docks, the keep, and the major intersection.

3 - Socioeconomic divides

It's an intimidating name (unless you like socioeconomic divides) but it's key to a city's layout. Only the tiniest of cities have mixed income and social class areas. Once you get big, there will be parts of the city where the rich, the poor, and the average people live. Also, since in real life there's black neighbourhoods and white neighbourhoods and latino neighbourhoods in larger cities, there will be elf neighbourhoods and dwarf neighbourhoods and human neighbourhoods.

Lastly, there's the location of these neighbourhoods. The poor tend to live in cheap places close to where they work. This will mean the docks in a port city, near the mines in a mining city, near the walls in a land trade city and outside in the fields in a farm city. The rich will live somewhere safe and far from the poor. Thus, if the poor live by the docks, the rich live inland near the keep. If the poor live out in the fields, the rich will live inside the walls.

4 - The keep

Size of the city determines the size of the keep. A small town will have a small wood building surrounded by a wooden palisade. A large town will have a medium stone building with wood or stone walls around the keep and wood walls around the town. A city will have several stone buildings (guardsmen live separate from the nobles who live separate from the servants) surrounded by thick, tall stone walls, and likely the city will be surrounded by stone walls. A metropolis will have several layers of stone walls from continued expansion beyond the gates. Typically, the density will be high - shopkeepers will live above their shops, as will some more citizens above them, and the next shop over will be very, very close by.

That's what I have. Take it or leave it."

ozzimark,formula1,1391105939.0,"&gt;Doesn't this impart a significant amount of ""flow"" to the exhaust stream?

Yes, but it's also important to keep in mind that at BDC, the cylinder pressure is still far above atmospheric pressure.

&gt;Wouldn't it be best if the thermal expansion which comes from burning the fuel be contained within the combustion chamber through the power stroke?

If you do some searching on [Carnot Efficiency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_cycle#Efficiency_of_real_heat_engines), you'll find exactly what you're alluding to: higher expansion ratios improve the efficiency of an engine. This allows for more energy to be extracted from the combustion by-products, resulting in a lower pressure and lower temperature within the cylinder when the exhaust valve opens.

Unfortunately, there are practical limits to how far this can be pushed, because most engine setups result in equal compression and expansion ratios. A high compression ratio leads to all sorts of problems with pre-detonation/pinging. Additionally, there are diminishing returns on the efficiency improvements, which make those problems not worth the effort.

&gt;If you could cycle a motor at race speed without burning any fuel, it would still blow gasses out the tail pipe, right? Not nearly as much, obviously, but wouldn't it still flow?

Yup. An engine is basically an air pump, it would blow almost an equal *mass* of gas out the tail-pipe, with the primary difference being the lack of fuel introduced into the gaseous mixture. The *energy* of the exhaust stream would be way way down though, despite having a similar mass flow."

crashonthebeat,AskMen,1391106010.0,"I'm a guy who has been in that situation, but on the recieving end of a bad texter. She was great in person. However, she would never initiate texting, and reply very sparingly. It led me to believe she wasn't interested (and she actualy wasn't interested), so I stopped, as I believed I was juat badgering her.

In the end, it'll depend on the guy. However, know that we're entering the age where frequent communication is everywhere, and more are going to expect it. 

A lot of guys are going to just assume you aren't interested id you don't respomd or initiatw texting, or at least some form of conversation. Texting is superior, because it allows one to do other activities while texting, and people are getting incredibly better at it, just like people adapted to talking on the phone.

So in short: yes, lack of texting is a major problem pretty often."

Go ahead and tell me what ""rights"" I can extend to you and what opportunities I can give you. (Notice I didn't say ""what rights mean ol' whitey can extend to you"". I said, what rights can *I* extend to you.)

Of course, instead of blaming me for your predicament, you could always try writing your representatives in Congress and city office, being active in your community by donating to and supporting charities and organizations which focus on helping minorities, or just getting off your ass and actually trying to make the world a better place for minorities...

Y'see, blaming me and other whites for your problem only works on bleeding heart liberals who have a huge guilt complex for being born white. It doesn't work on me. In fact, it makes me *much less likely* to care about your problems because then I take it that you are unjustly accusing me of shit I am not responsible for.

Other than that, which is a pass, I think you're justified in your feelings about this situation. I briefly dated a self-proclaimed ""very flirty and overly friendly"" girl, but I quickly found that to be her excuse for being an insecure attention whore who could accuse guys of being overly jealous when they called her out on it (she complained of her exes getting jealous at bars and the like). The key here is to determine how she acts when YOU are around these other guys. If she is giving you the cold shoulder while flirting with them, she ain't worth it.

Regarding Johnboy, he gets a pass in regards to the concert. Hell, I've had trouble finding people to go to shows with me, and pretty much anyone who is willing to go is cool in my book. However, Johnboy doesn't get a pass when it comes to ""Her"". You've been dating this broad for 4 months, yet she won't see a fucking movie with you because she's seeing it with a ""friend"" in 4 days? That's bullshit. She went out for drinks with a guy who has feelings for her? That's bullshit.

I don't know how serious/exclusive y'all are after 4 months, but there is a fine line between having male friendships and male affection, and I think she's crossed it. It'll be hard to confront her without coming across as overly jealous, honestly, but flip the tables and it's suddenly a different scenario. How would she perceive it if she wanted to see some chick-flick with you, and you said you wouldn't because you were planning on seeing it with someone else? Yeah..."

However, from level 8 up, things get a lot easier.

Then again, level 8 is pretty much already grand hero level. Fierce, powerful warriors and renowned wizards beyond compare are at these levels. These guys are not everyman-level.

With 4e, they tried to make dying harder. Players like their characters. In OD&amp;D, you died at the drop of a hat. People were getting tired of it, and so TSR and later WOTC responded by making death more and more difficult to attain.

I'd say that you should allow miraculous last-minute saves to a character who's only been around for a level or two. Above that, it's fair game. I personally don't like easy ressurection. I think dangerous reagents and eldritch spells with dire consequences are better than a simple 1000gp level 8 ritual.

I tend to give my PCs difficult encounters (1-3 levels higher) in small numbers, or long strings of normal or easy encounters.

One encounter will not kill a PC. Several hard ones in a row will."

kornberg,HomeImprovement,1391106526.0,"The best way to update those cabinets is to change out the handles. You don't have to paint them but you can if you want to go for a French/shabby chic/country farmhouse type look and if you do, stain them with an ivory or pale grey whitewash. 

Assuming you don't want to paint the cabinets, take out all of that tile. All of it. It's cheaper and probably nicer looking if you replaced the sheetrock and just had regular walls that you painted (it also makes it easier to update 30 years from now) and replace the backsplash with white or clear/green glass subway tiles. It's super classic and will hold up stylistically over a long time compared to something more trendy like all of the mosaic tile going up right now. I'd also replace the countertops with granite--it adds a lot of value, is easier to care for than laminate and will make the kitchen look a lot more updated. 

Replace the lighting with something brighter and avoid any yellow or warm tinted frosty globe things--stick with white light. You can also put task lighting in under the cabinets, that would help a lot. 

Take out the vinyl tiles floor and put in ceramic tile--you should probably go darker with this so as not to look weird or like you tried and failed at going matchy matchy (which is slightly worse than being matchy matchy) with the white tile backsplash and a dark floor with a bright everything else will not make the room look darker. Since your appliances are black, natural slate tiles would look really nice, as would anything in greyscale. "

PlushieChomby,relationships,1391106602.0,"That's what boggles my mind. I've repeatedly told men the same thing I'd tell women, and women the same thing I'd tell men. It's all circumstantial, and all based on whatever view the OP presents. I see others doing the exact same thing. I'm neither a misogynist nor a misandrist, and I consistently see the vast majority of commenters giving solidly good advice not slanted in ridiculous favor toward either sex, and yet once in a while somebody pops up crying about how if the sexes were reversed, the advice would be different or the opposite of what's being given (even though my experience on this sub says that's absolutely false and the crowd here is a large group with pretty good common sense and varied experiences who have a lot to contribute to discussions) and then decrying the group by throwing in some kind of, ""You guys are shit if you're downvoting me I GUESS THIS SUB HAS GONE TO HELL THEN IF YOU THINK I'M WRONG"" kind of tantrum. 

I agree with the ""too quick to jump on the 'just dump them' bandwagon"", because it's easy to tell someone else to do something when you're not that person, when you don't understand all the intricate details of the life and relationship in question, and I try to avoid it for the most part and suggest alternatives (therapy, talking things out, taking time for personal activities and reflection on what you both really want, whatever) but then again, it's all dependent on what OP says. Like in this particular case: OP presents things in a way that say the two are utterly incompatible in belief, thought and practice. They're not 85 years old and just trying to wing it for the last years of their lives; if they're really that incompatible, they should indeed end it. I can also think of relationships I've had where I wish I'd come to this subreddit and gotten advice to end it, because they ended anyway and perhaps the extra push from strangers to do what I knew was right, but couldn't bring myself to do because of what was instilled in me through my upbringing, would have helped me to end things sooner and avoid a lot of heartbreak. 

So I guess I'm just torn on the issue. I feel like we're all human here, and doing the best we can do, sometimes it's wrong and sometimes it's right but that's okay: the ultimate decisions are always left up to OP. 

You're absolutely right that it's the same advice that would be given to a woman, though.

I've always liked the Acura TSXes, they've gotten a little beige-er but for a DD they are solid and have a lot of good features. After a little depreciation (1-2 years used) they might be right where you want them, price wise. Recommend getting the I4 over the V6 as the front end is lighter (handling) and better on gas.

Countpudyoola,AskMen,1391106862.0,"No and with personal experience:

At 30 I chose to look for a job and move back to my home state. 

I got the job offer before I sold my house so I decided to move in with my mom and start work.

My mom and I had a great relationship but I was an adult male and she was my mother. Even so she could not stop being my mother and this led to her treating me like I was still her responsibility and we regressed to almost a high school-parent relationship.

Case and point where I realized this was severely unhealthy:
I went for a run in the old neighborhood. No big deal. It was hot and in the summer so I went out around 5pm. Running through the old hood I saw a friend of mine's dad who I hadn't seen in a long time so I stopped to chat. I had nowhere to be, am an adult, in a well lit safe neighborhood.

After about an hour of catching up and leisurely running around a car pulls up and starts flashing cop lights. 
And I'm like, are you serious? I realize I'm a dude running around in wonder-bread retirey land but do I look that suspicious? 

Turned out to be my brother ( a warden.. guess they need lights), who my mother had called to come comb the neighborhood for me because I was gone for so long (in this case an hour &amp; change), ""you could have been hit by a car...you could have been mugged, etc"". 

My mom was freaked out, my brother inconvenienced , and I was humiliated and emasculated. But I knew she was my mom and whether I was 30 or 50 she'd be obliged to worry if she always was inadvertently aware of my plans and something set off her mom warning lights.

So because I worried about my impact on her health (in her early 70s, already had a triple bypass) I started making sure I kept her up to date on my every move. In h.s. it was because it was the rule, now it was just because I worried about her...but the end result is the same.

Also at the time I was single. And the stigmata, no matter how legit, of a guy living with his parents is that you are a loser. 

And if a girl can see past it: it still puts any potential romantic interest in a position of meeting your parents WAY TOO FREAKING EARLY in a relationship and can send mixed signals ....just because of your living situation. 

Another thing I noticed is how WAY TOO COMFORTABLE I had become with ma occasionally doing my laundry and cooking dinner regularly. A lot of time I spent sitting around and watching tv with her. It takes the place of a lot of activities you spend with friends or dating.

It took my house 3 months to sell and as soon as the paperwork was in I had put my 1st months rent in on an apartment.

After I moved out I still went over to her house for dinner  and to watch some TV (had a standing day once a week). The dynamic was better and more normal for an adult male and his mother once I had moved out. 
One of the reasons I moved back was to spend time with her as she was aging and had health issues. She passed a few years back...so I never regretted my decision to leave the big city to return, just wish I could have done it without having to put her and me in a weird spot for 3 months.


TLDR: NOPE

That's like saying, if the majority of the people in a country hate gays, that *the country hates gays*. No, just a majority of the people in that country hate gays.

But then you'd say ""the laws of the country would oppress homosexuals"" and you'd be probably correct.

Two years ago while hunting moose, I sprayed scent remover spray in a bag and stored my clothes in it overnight, then the next morning I sprayed it on myself and covered my boots in it, paying special attention to the soles so my footprints wouldn't smell like the camp. 

I then tracked where I saw bull moose tracks going the two days previous, picked a good clear vantage point by the trail and waited for him to come by. I didn't move or make a sound all morning. 

Suddenly I saw this 1 meter tall white animal walking up the trail. I thought at first it was a coyote and I got worried they had surrounded me. Then I took a better look and realized I was looking at a real life lynx. He had no idea I was right there next to him in the open, despite being 15-20 feet away. He paused and curled his face up in a Flehman response, looked around for me and then wandered down the hill. He had these long gangly legs and paws the size of a man's fists. 

I was still kind of in awe about this encounter when I caught a glimpse of him running back up the hill, sniffing the trail. He had my scent for sure this time, add I realized I better let him know I was there before he got too close. Figured it was that or wait till he got close and then reach out and pet the kitty. 

I stood up, we made eye contact, he suddenly looked like a scared cat. He hunched low in the grass, then ran off back down the hill.

I'm not lazy.  I can work really, really hard, and I often do.  I'll give up on sleeping and eating to do something that I'm really engaged in (mostly because I don't notice that time is passing).  So, I'm not lazy, but my career work isn't very engaging.  That's not entirely my fault.  (I'm working on that too...  not easy)

I sometimes find John Green's advice helpful.  He says that when contemplating troublesome tasks, wondering why you can't seem to do them, even if they're easy, isn't helpful.  For you, they're hard to do, even if the task seems simple.  Acknowledge that the task is difficult for you, regardless of the reason, and then acknowledge that you're going to do it anyway.

A ceiling fan is about a bajillion times easier and cheaper to install, even if you don't have existing fixtures, plus they actually help keep the air cool in the summer heat. 

As for the camera system, while I won't go into how that's going to be a lot of money for something you won't use as much as you think you will, just know that to install anything like what you'd want is going to be pricey. Really pricey. Like, $2500 may cover the cameras and system but not the installation pricey. Think about it--you're going to want cameras in each room, possibly more than one in each room. You will need cameras specifically designed to function outdoors as well. You will need some sort of system to connect them and send the feed to you offsite as well as the equipment needed to mount, connect and power the cameras. I'd call around to home security companies and price out their services. I know you think you can get materials cheaper but usually they get a better deal on materials since they buy in bulk, so price things out with them and compare their quotes for each item to what you can find before writing them off. Also think about how you want them to look in your home. Are you ok with big ol cameras in every corner freaking out your guests or would you prefer a discreet lens in a wall, freaking out your guests less often but more severely? 

As for the ceiling fans, if you want them in rooms without fans but with fixtures, you can totally install those yourself. They come with specific instructions, if you can stand on a ladder and use a screwdriver, you will be fine. For the ones without pre-existing light fixtures, I'd cut a small hole in the ceiling to look for a possible hidden set up and if I didn't see anything, I'd call an electrician and have him install the wiring for the fan and install the fans myself.

Two caveats though:

If you haven't checked out the other engineering disciplines yet, then make sure that civil engineering is the one you're the most interested in. You don't want to spend two semesters studying it before realizing that electrical or mechanical is more suited to you.

Get really, *really*, ***really*** good at math if you aren't already. Make sure you completely understand everything up to and including pre-calculus intuitively. Make sure your algebra skills are spot-on. Study the stuff on your own time if they aren't. Majoring in engineering is *awesome*, but keep in mind that doing so means your life is going to be nothing but complicated forms of calculus for the next four years or so.

Are you saying that by being ""strong all over"" you could box/mma? If you get into a ring/octagon (box/mma) with me, even though im somewhat chubby, i would bash your head out of your neck and im not a lifter nor really THAT strong.

Don't think body weight and muscles count in martial arts, technique counts 100 times over strength, yes you could win at first due to body size and strength against newbies, but you couldn't defeat anyone half decent until you got your technique down. 

Look at the best heavyweight of all time, fedor, or even a current one, cain velasquez, both of them are somewhat chubby, and they could (and have) beat most of the guys that have a gym rat kind of body.

Yes, doing hill running will help with your cardio, but you also need to do sprints for that yummy explosive power. But still, its mostly technique, even if you're dead tired if the technique is hardwired into your brain, you'll get out of most bad situations out of pure insctinct.

On the other hand, if you want to do American Football or Rugby, be my guest, you can be a dumb ape but have enough strength to power your way through an NFL contract.

LyssaBrisby,DeadBedrooms,1391107960.0,"In sickness and in health is a worthy aspiration. But... you haven't taken that vow: she is your girlfriend, not your wife. At this point, if she is incapable of participating in a full relationship with a partner, perhaps she should be single until she *is* capable. In the interim, she can work on her therapy and her medication without using you as a crutch.

I am genuinely sympathetic to her medical and assault issues (and I agree with 60565 that the recentness of these events should factor into your choices) but it is not your job to fix her, or enable her while she delays prioritizing those fixes. I guess you have to decide whether the emphasis and effort she's placing on getting better is enough for you, and whether her ""better"" would ever be enough for you anyway."

Therein lies the problem. You presume, subconsciously, that everyone on this site is from your country, for whatever reason. Do you know how alienating that is? When you spend your whole day bombarded by foreign US culture and then come onto the internet and BAM every American just assumes everyone else is American. Of course you don't, because you don't know what that would feel like.

You try living in a world where your own country is becoming more and more foreign every day.

And just so you know, there was a subreddit of that name, but it was banned because it was obscenely racist. /r/murica is the opposite of racist, it's the most obviously patriotic thing I've ever seen and if you can't see that, well I'd hate to see what your kind of patriotism is"

polysyllabist,49ers,1391108018.0,"Thing is, I don't believe he throws that ball 1 foot farther and he's a great QB. He went for it all with too much time on the clock, even if he scores he gives Seattle too much left to get a FG with. It's dumb play. There's no time pressure, good field position, why go for it all there?

That interception and his other two earlier were all indicative to me of him lacking the calm necessary to get it done a little bit at a time. Which is the more reliable way, and when 1 loss is all it take in the post season, reliable is key.

I wish Kap would hurry up and move beyond the living and dying by the big play. That's not what makes a good QB. A good comeback QB isn't the one who gets lucky by sending up a lucky/huge play 1 time out of three (and fumbles and gets picked off the other two).

A great QB is one that _doesn't_ need huge plays to win a game.

He died by his play style in Seattle and singlehandedly lost that game. Living isn't throwing the ball 1 foot farther, living is ditching the mentality that 1 td is worth two turnovers."
cybaritic,AskReddit,1391108019.0,"I had been in an abusive relationship for a while.  She didn't give a shit about my feelings on anything, physically abused me, took all my extra money, made me feel horrible about myself.  It was a really dark time in my life that I'm ashamed to have lived.  Once I finally broke up with her I had this amazing sense of freedom.  I was able to live my own way again.  Every once in a while she would call me and try to get back together, but I wasn't having it.  Every once in a while I would remember some of the rare good times and think about her, but I knew that she was an awful, horrible bitch that I never wanted to see again.

One day I finally made the connection... smoking was an another abusive relationship for me.  It made me stink, made me feel bad about myself, kept me out of fun social situations, ""physically abused"" me by hurting my health, cost me approximately $18k USD over the course of ten years... and for what?  What did I have to show for it?  Nothing!  I was no further along in life by being a smoker than if I was a non smoker.  So I ""broke up"" with cigarettes.  Wrote a break up letter and everything.  And again I felt a remarkable sense of freedom.  Every once in a while, cigs would ""call"" me (withdrawal pang).  Every once in a while, I would remember a good time I had while smoking and think about it, but I knew that it was a horrible addiction I could easily live without.  And at that point, quitting was easy.

If your mom cries, she cries. You can't control her actions, you can only control your reactions. So she cries because you don't want to deal with your sister dumping her kid off on you for 2 weeks?

What does your brother think about this? Will he back you up? If he will, great! Recruit him and together try to get your mom to see that your sister is taking advantage of her.

benk4,asoiaf,1391108530.0,"I know this was up as a major post very recently, but this one really stuck with me.  It's beautifully written and one of the most powerful passages in the series.  

&gt; Septon Meribald disagreed. “More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They’ve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know. “Then they get a taste of battle. “For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they’ve been gutted by an axe. “They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when that’s still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water. “If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they’re fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it’s just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don’t know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they’re fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world . . . “And the man breaks. “He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them . . . but he should pity them as well."

Blindocide,DebateReligion,1391108669.0,"Yeah, exactly like how the Founding Father's invention of a working democratic system has consciously or unconsciously informed every lay man's understanding of Democracy.

What you're basically suggesting is that its pointless to respond to someone's views on democracy without bothering to learn what the Founding Fathers said, because the Founding Fathers laid out the traditional doctrine of democracy and what have you.

I mean... that's just false. You can learn about, say, the German Democratic System (with a completely separate constitution and Bill of Rights) and then discuss someone's views on what a democracy is and how it should work, without ever once learning about 'Merica.

Or, shit, we can bring it all the way back to the Greeks! How many children are taught the Greeks invented democracy before they learn America did it?

Do you have to learn about the traditional Greecian concept of democracy in order to discuss someone's views of democracy?

Starwhisperer,AskReddit,1391108756.0,"This made me cry.   
  
This is truly heartbreaking considering I just attended a Veritas Lecture where the topic was ""Are We Merely Machines"". The speaker does alot of work with autistic folks, and it really struck with me what she said about how someone's actions and external behaviour/expressions doesn't necessarily relate to their inner consciousness/being if that makes sense. Non-autistic humans have the tendency to look and perceive someone's outwardly behaviour to mean certain things, and in so doing, might mistakenly place a misplaced attitude on someone else. So for example, if someone who is autistic refused to look me in the eyes or some other act, I might think that said person does not care about me or might not want to talk to me, or love me. But then the speaker so eloquently worded that just because someone doesn't express their love and emotions the way that you would expect them to, does not mean that those feelings do not exist.  
  
I truly wish you the best. You are not overstaying your welcome, because in my opinion, your parents wasn't the one who granted you life, but it came from God above. And how can you say you don't contribute, when you contributed that eye-opening piece that made me shed tears. "

Slide your finger down your face (toward your jaw) until you feel the ""dip"" where your cheekbone stops and the hollow/fleshy part begins. Contour right there, starting back in your hairline (sort of at the level of your ear so it looks like a natural hollow) and blending inward, following the natural line of your cheekbone toward your mouth. Rule of thumb is to stop the contour about parallel with your pupil, the outer edge of your iris, or some part of your eye. I say do it however you like, but make sure you blend the hell out of it so it looks natural.

It's hard to be a fan of turn-based games and not appreciate the Fire Emblem franchise.

Awakening is a great game, perhaps my favorite since I picked up the original GBA one in 5th grade. The game has a couple different difficulty levels that really allows people new to the series to pick up and play right away while gaining an understanding of the battle strategies in use. If you still for some reason need help, or are struggling with a certain level, there are many guides and tips to be found online in places such as Youtube, serenesforest, and even this subreddit.

You can probably tell that I'm biased towards this game, but it's for a good reason. I encourage anyone who has the funds and even a small interest in Fire Emblem: Awakening to give it a try, this game is full of depth and has a lot of replay-abilty."

You can also improve hard drive performance by running a GOOD hard drive utility program. I personally like Spinrite a lot, but currently its speed can be sharply limited by the BIOS on your motherboard (if the BIOS does not support the full speed and size of RAM you have available). Updates should eliminate this soon, and improve performance even more, but 6.1 hasn't been released yet.

Paired with the fact that school costs so much is enough to send an unsure person into overwhelming crisis mode. Also add that each school is separated sometimes only by minute differences makes making the right choice seem as desirable as cutting off your own limbs. 

I hate this stage in my life. I should be happy, hanging out with friends out on the town, relaxing at night with my favourite show. Instead my mind is 24/7 buzzed and I have a constant sense of dread about making the wrong choice and spinning into crisis. I'm living in the future. I'm depressed, i'm anxious, i'm angry at the world for making this so hard for me (and for us). I spend my weekends in front of my laptop and convincing myself that i'm a failure for not knowing what I want to do. My parents don't understand as much because when they we're my age they only had to pick between ""History, English, Math, etc..."" as their major at any school they went to, I have to pick between a list of  ""Bioinformatics with a smidge of history"", ""Classic history with a technological focus"", ""Classic history with a writing focus but with a little bit of plant studies"", ""Mathematics for game design"", ""Mathematics for technology"", ""Computer engineering in relation to the supercalifragilisticexpialidotious"", etc etc...

What if i'm at a technology specialized school and I find out i'd rather study traditional English and story writing? What if I transfer to a school that specializes in this and I decide i'm still unhappy and maybe I was better suited to the technology school? I couldn't possibly just switch back.

They wonder why anxiety and depression along with stress has gone up immensely over the past few decades, this is exactly why. This is way too much choice. This. Is. So. Overwhelmingly. Stressful."

It's a boutique condo building, 14 stories tall with only 6 apartment (every unit is at least a duplex).

Most bathroom walls are to be clad with large Italian marble slabs. In many parts of the country, you could buy an entire house for less than that.

That's good for teams who are in relegation battles/mid table who need help now.  But match-winning type of players aren't developed in the MLS as of yet they're developed in academies that are simply more advanced than what the MLS has right now.  

The betterment of American soccer will come between between two somewhat contradictory paths.  The best young talents need to be sent to the best academies as soon as possible, i.e. not in America.    Or the MLS academies have to be so good that there can be no possible bias held against American players when the graduates go to Europe.  "

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1391109282.0,"Estaunidense may not have existed, but it's based on a productive Spanish suffix, as others are saying.  English did the same thing in the same time period--Argentine became Argentinian, for instance.  We've got both Slovene and Slovenian--the latter developed by adding a productive suffix to a place name to make a new demonym.  No reason necessary.  Many other demonyms have two or more forms, with one made later on based on an existing pattern, such as Serb/Serbian, Afghan/Afghani, Croat/Croatian, Yemenite/Yemeni, etc.  I don't think there was a reason any of the newer terms were coined and spread--they were based on existing patterns in the language, and simply caught on.

Yet I don't think you'd assume style guides would have reasoning included in their change for that--they'd just note that ""Argentinian"" was more common than ""Argentine"" now, and ""Slovenian"" had surpassed ""Slovene"".  A term was formed from a productive suffix, and caught on.  While it's possible there was more to americano/estaunidense, it's possible that it's just language change, like all those examples above.

ohyayitstrey,DebateAChristian,1391109323.0,"2 things.
You say you are more moral than some Christians you know.  I do not doubt this claim.  I would only modify it to say that you are more moral than people you know who *claim* to be Christian.  
  
Consider what Jesus says in John 14:21: ""He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him.""  
  
Consider also what He says in Matthew 7:21-23: ""Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.’  
  
So that is just to show that you may not be comparing yourself to actual Christians.  
  
**This is the part that answers your question.**  
  
My next claim is that apart from Christianity, you have no consistent moral framework with which you can make moral claims.  You say you avoid vices, but who says those things are a vice?  Society/culture can't say it, because those vary over time and geography.  Making your own morals is problematic because someone else could make morals that are opposed to yours, so then how do you determine who is right and who is wrong?  You can't say nothing is neither good nor bad, because then you can't say bacon is good nor murder is bad.  There must be a higher law to appeal to.  I posit that the Christian God of the Bible is where that higher law comes from because all other worldviews are either internally inconsistent, externally inconsistent, or both.  
  
**TL;DR Morality needs a framework, Christianity is the only worldview that offers that framework, you can't have objective, consistent morality apart from Christianity.**  
  
One final note is that you don't currently see or understand the weight and penalty your sin currently carries.  That is why it seems like you can ignore God/Christianity.  I beg you to follow God's will and repent of any sin because your choice to follow Him or not is an eternal decision with eternal consequences that cannot be taken lightly.  Feel free to message me."

I would like to point out that men have the same feelings and emotional issues. It's just that I think many of them are conditioned to hold it in. In that, I feel sorry for them. They lash out physically instead of emotionally. Maybe that's why more men are prone to drinking or substance abuse. I don't have a statistic available or anything but that's my opinion.

SpankWhoWithWhatNow,confession,1391109453.0,"What experience do you base this on, especially to say that *""a lot""* of Marines have temper/violence problems?  I'm honestly curious, but I imagine you just had the luck of some less-than-pleasant interactions with Marines.  I'm a Marine combat vet, and have never had any of those issues.  I also would say that the vast majority of the guys I served with were great guys, some a little hot-headed, and of course there were some with bad tempers, just like in any workplace.  The ones who would have bad tempers, or prone to violent outbursts, would be that way regardless of serving or not.  I will say that the Marine culture, especially in the infantry, might place certain tendencies closer to the surface, but you also learn to keep more in control.  The ones who are on a hair trigger (as it sounds like this guy was) are often looked down on, and are not representative of all or most Marines.  
  
I'm not saying what OP did was right, or that there are no Marines who would act that way, but it's quite the sweeping generalization to attribute his behavior to his Marine Corps service, instead of the more likely fact that he's simply got a bad temper and other issues that are totally unrelated to the military."

It feels like every lane just loses every game and the jungler has no impact. Wickd and shook play two champions each Lee/elise and Malph/renekton (Malphite being useless) so Wickd can basically play one champ.  Froggen only farms mid. Never has an impact in other lanes. He just doesn't understand that the game isn't 1v1. Doesn't matter that you are 20cs ahead if you don't even get the tower and the enemy mid laner has secured two dragons and 4 kills for their team.The botlane just goes even or behind they never win the lane and they get outperformed in teamfights in almost every game. Everyone talks about how they lack team synergy while that is true too I actually just think they lack individual skill across the board. Two of their players aren't picking up new champions and remain non factors every game even if they win the game.

Let me give you an example: You can walk on the street and say that christianity is stupid, and it may be offensive but it doesn't have that strong impact. But if you go to a home of a conversative christian family and you say that exact same thing it will have a different impact. Different places require diferent sensibilities. This is a place for short people, not tall. They can come here and participate, it's cool, but it doesn't make it their ""home"", so to speak.

AKA_Sotof,worldnews,1391109769.0,"Originally we had two parties: Højre (Right) and Venstre (Left). Højre has changed name since then to ""De Konservative"" (The Conservatives), essentially their motto is: Gud, Konge og Fædreland (God, King and Fatherland). In the old days (18-something) they were made up out the rich and powerful. Venstre was consequently our liberal party at the time and mostly consisted of land owners such as farmers. Thus back then you have Venstre who sit on the left politically and Højre who sits on the right.

This balance gets upset when newer parties get introduced such as 'Det Radikale Venstre' (The Radical Left), which today is just 'De Radikale' (The Radicals), and back then they were the ultimate left - now they are in the middle. They are in the middle now because we got social democrats, socialists and communists as well after a while.

So it makes sense if you look at it from a historic perspective, but if you look at it without any kind of context the name 'Venstre' does seem senseless."

If the businesses weren't so stubborn about locating in the city center, they *could* locate near the people who work there and avoid the messed up commutes that cripple cities.

duggtodeath,offbeat,1391110134.0,"&gt; the source of the problem of the loss of rights is this: the problem is unchecked statism.

This is a claim based on an uninformed opinion. Not evidence.

&gt; Statism, nationalized socialism, authoritarianism - these are the very real movements that are destroying our natural/human rights and our constitutional on a continual and unending basis.

Again, you are making claims. This is not evidence for these undertakings.

&gt; the statist agenda conflates the support/opposition of government power with any topic that the legislature of the day turns its attention to - those who simply oppose bad law are instantly branded as those who oppose/support the behavior

Dude, what? Agenda? Who made the agenda? Who benefits? Agendas don't pop out of no where. Again, this is a conspiracy theory to believe in secret plans that only you and the enlightened can see. Many Americans oppose bad laws, I doubt that our government seriously brands us anything. Also a government is more than some amorphous blob. It is a collection of people. Be specific.

&gt; Statist: ""You don't support this reactionary legislation that was penned by idiots who know nothing of guns that arbitrarily bans certain firearms (in direct opposition to 2A)? WHAT? DO YOU WANT MORE DEAD KIDS? Ban 30 bullet (lol) assault (whatever that means) clips (lol) NAU!""

I fail to see any part of the Constitution that guarantees my right to 30 round mags. The ammunition capacity of any firearm is arbitrary. More or less rounds isn't taking away anyones right to own a firearm. And if you were serious about gun safety, you'd support background checks so psychos can't get their hands on them.

&gt; Rights loving citizen

Dude, stop diving people into rights-loving and anti-rights. That is boiling down an argument into simple black and white. That is dishonest and poor form. It's used by idiots to demean the arguments of others and dismiss them outright. It's am US vs THEM mentality that does not allow you to look honestly at your position. Stop using these terms.

And actually, I have no clue if less rounds would stop violence, I can sorta agree there, but at least let us keep them out the hands of mentally ill. Science has progressed much, we can screen for certain mental defects now at young ages. We understand more about our brains everyday. They did not have access to the understanding years ago. When we have better information, we can make better decisions.

&gt; Statist: ""murderer! Sicko! You can't hunt a deer with an assault rifle(lol). YOU WANT MORE DEAD KIDS? MUH CHILLENS!""

Stop being ghoulish. The very fact that you cannot even show sympathy for shot-up kids tells me what type of heartless person you are. Cowering behind a cold inanimate object hopping it will keep your imaginary fears of the outside world away. Shame on you.

&gt; Political discussion is shut down, move to a vote, the idiots proceed headlong despite their law being a ""feel good, do nothing"" law, and they are happy. For now. Then another shooting tragedy occurs.

I think you are failing to link the tragedy to the availability of firearms to mentally unstable people. Why are firearms invisible in your argument? This is a gun debate. The firearms is what we should be talking about since they were used in the crime. Keep your guns, but also keep them away from crazies.

&gt; Take that capacity of magazines down another 10 rounds! Also ban this list of guns that have scary names and I saw in some action movies once!""

So your argument is that politicians are not using evidence to support their claims? See how that feels when someone else does it? Politicians have always gotten basic facts wrong. I too chuckle that the ATF not knowing what some firearms are classified as, or the DEA trying hard to make marijuana seem like it will kill you in one puff. They will always get something wrong, thats why no one else hire's them ;) Joking aside, I still don't see this taking guns or rights away from me or you. I can still get a firearm and outside of a warzone, I cannot see someone changing mags in an extended shootout with someone trying to rob you.

&gt; And then more rights are taken. By their nature, the statist is never satisfied. All of societies ills can be cured simply be legislating it away to them.

Dude, you can't just say rights are taken and fail to demonstrate that. I cannot see any right be taken away. You have more freedoms right now to own a gun, even during the Bush Jr era. You have no rights taken from you. You still collect a paycheck, go to work, pay your taxes, drive where you like and get to relax in a comfortable home with all your guns.

&gt; And any citizen who dares oppose their will is branded a racist/conspiracy theorist/boogeyman/terrorists/literally hitler.

Dude, are you seriously trying to say that the oppression people like you feel comes from the fact that they hate being called racists? Maybe rethink your stance on certain subjects and see them from someone else's shoes.

&gt; And people like you will shrivel when exposed to truth and the righteousness of human rights, the supreme law of the nation, and other good citizens.

Wait, so America is both a nation taking away your rights, but at the same time provides you with human rights, supremacy of law and good citizens to back you up? So which America are you angry at?

&gt; And this (or similar) has happened in the following states: CA NY CT MD NJ MA.

Again, you failed to show me people lost rights because they are limited in how many bullets a gun can hold. Again, you are citing one case. I hardly see anyone suffering because of lost rights. Can you still buy the firearm? YES. Can you still buy rounds? YES. Can you still own and much bullets as your arms can cart away? YES. You've lost nothing. The gun lobby hasn't even tried to compromise on background checks and screening for mental instability. You should be mad at the allies who remained intractable for some silly fear of having guns taken out their homes by socialist liberals.

&gt; I was discussing the human right of self defense. And in your mindless statist narrative - you have conflated me with racism and other terrible things. And this is why you are a hateful and ignorant fool.

I never disagreed with you. However. American had self-defense laws on the books. We didn't need SYG because it meant that the law didn't have to be involved, and it unfairly targeted minorities. Heck, if I tried to use that law, they would throw me in jail if I didn't kill the ""right"" type of citizen. The evidence and numbers I presented show and prove that. You have nothing to argue unless you have compelling counter-evidence to show that SYG does not unfairly target blacks and the poor. Heck, even a bunch of white dudes have been killed by the law, and they won't get to say their side of the story because some gun-toting wanna-be cowboy decided that he was scared and so opened fire. We are a civilized society. This isn't the movie-style Wild West and its not Mad Max. We are not allowed to instigate confrontations, get scared by what we started and use lethal means to end that. I could not invite you into my house, then shoot you dead and tell the cops you trespassed. You wouldn't be able to defend your side of the story. Any idiot would be able to shoot someone down and then cry self-defense. I'm sure if the reports showed that the perpetrators were all black males and the shooting victims white females, you'd be against SYG, but you aren't because it works in your political favor.

&gt; And if you need further examples of rights lost to ignorance and fear campaigns perpetuated by statist moralists, see the following:

&gt; -Prohibition. Perpetrator: religious moralist Prohibitionists.

This was overturned. Look, I can still buy and enjoy a beer. Nope, still got my rights.

&gt; -The Mulford act. Perpetrator: Reagan and a ton of scared racist Californians

Oh wow, so you have to unload your firearm before walking in the street in that state. Yeah, I can that stealing rights from 300+ million Americans. Still got my rights.

&gt; -Rainwater tax. Perpetrator: Md legislators. 

Oh wow, this was rejected there. Still got my rights.

&gt; -Repeal of the smith mundt act. Perpetrator: Obama. 

Oh noes, The US ends the ban on domestic propaganda? Fuck, right in my rights! Wait a second. so you are telling me that we were given permission to let US households tune-in to hear the type of programming that has previously only been allowed in outside nations? All this does is give Americans the chance to see what the State Department is saying to people all over the world. PANIC MUCH? Still got my rights.

&gt; -Every anti 2A law post sandy hook. Perpetrator: a ton of states legislators.

No one is against the 2nd amendment. We ask you to help us screen owners to prevent these tragedies. We didn't pretend this would solve all crimes, but it would stem them greatly. The argument from your side of the argument drummed up conspiracy theories about databases tracking gun owners to make them easier to arrest. Like the govt doesn't have a database of you birth records, drivers license, home address, tax information and more, but heaven-forbid they know you own a firearm.

Did you read any of the stuff you just shared? You are grasping at straws. None of these show any rights being lost. You clearly misunderstood some of them and there is not one American who could do something 50 years ago that he cannot do now (beside firing 30 rounds continuously).

&gt; Spoiler - assault weapons bans are proven ineffectual they had their time, and time ran out and they were revealed as the failures they are.

Doesn't matter not arguing that. We just wanted to screen out the crazies. People against this motion are themselves the very crazies we want to keep away from guns.

Thanks for sharing!

People have an innate desire to believe they are special and are here for a purpose.

I don't, but that makes me somewhat sociopathic in certain situations.

I know talking about religion online will always be a shitshow but I think that there is such a thing as benign religious and militant religious. We should discourage the militant kind.

But having a billboard telling everyone ""praying does nothing"" is counterproductive and an atheist circlejerk.

When people of a certain group, in this instance religious people, feel threatened by the outside, it only reinforces them.

Think about it like this--I get up at 5 am on weekdays and anywhere between 9 and 11 on most weekends. So taking the pill first thing in the morning is out. I could take it (and I did this for years) around lunch time, but where do I put my pills when I go on a hike, or tubing down the river, or some other all day place where I don't usually carry a purse? I can't leave them in the car, the heat in the summer will ruin the effectiveness. Ok, so I take them in the evening or right before bed.

cybaritic,Reno,1391110673.0,"I was playing poker at the Silver Legacy during the Superbowl last year.  The sports bar had bleachers set up, the game on a huge screen, and the atmosphere was just electric.  Almost every single play and there was an uproar from the crowd.  I'm not really into sports, but in that environment it's easy to get swept up in the moments.  I'll probably go again this year.  :3"

My grandpa was a 2 pack a day guy. As a kid, I tried to get him to stop every way I could and finally one day he just got tired of coughing a lot and quit cold turkey. Came home, broke the cigs he had left and threw them away. Nobody could make him quit but him

Second is my best friends mom. She used to smoke a lot and one day she was driving around with her kids and me in the back, windows down a little to let the smoke out and it's raining. She finally realized what she was doing and how if effected us and quit slowly. "

bluesky747,MakeupAddiction,1391110678.0,":/ Looks like the shimmer didn't really show up too well. I did this a few hours ago, but took this picture just now. Time for a touch up!

**Edit**: [Here's a better picture](http://imgur.com/PzSTRyN) of my eyes, closed, after a touch up. Sorry for almost exposed breast...this tank top won't stop riding down. It's annoying.

Does anyone have any tips on contouring my nose? I tried but I don't think it really shows up. :/

Hardcore/punk rock has made me more inclined to wearing skate shoes, boots, slimmer fit clothes, jeans and t-shirts.

Hey there.

I went VLC and then NC with my mother in ~2010.  It was horrendous, and then it was wonderful.  I almost can't remember what it was like to carry that stress around, and the stories I tell now make me laugh - but it took therapy and support from my wife and lots and lots of tears.

All I really remember is that when I made the decision - when I decided I wouldn't talk to her anymore - it was like this huge deep breath of fresh air (literally).  You can't what the stress does to your mind and body.  You probably hear people say that, but you *don't really know* until you do it.

Trust me when I say this: you don't have any idea what normal is like, but it's a fun journey to find out.

Neebat,news,1391111341.0,"You've actually got your job description wrong, but I'll need to ask you a rhetorical question to demonstrate it.

If a dozen people come to you with a severed aorta from a knife fight, and you fail to save a single one, should you be fired for gross incompetence?

No.  Your job is not to save the person's life, because that may not be possible.

Isn't it your job to do the best you can to help the person, within the boundaries set by your abilities and the laws?  DNR orders exist because the law respects a patient's right to choose.  Patient consent may put limits on your ability to help.  But so can millions of other factors ranging from the weather to preexisting conditions or equipment shortages.

So, another rhetorical question:  If you have a patient with a DNR saying no ventilators, do you turn and walk away?  Or do you use the other treatments available, even though they're less effective?

Doctors are brilliant people with at least a decade of training for handling all kinds of crazy situations, including the limitations where standard procedure won't be possible.  When one treatment isn't usable, I trust a doctor to find the second best.

If the second best treatment you can do is literally nothing at all, you have done your job.  But if you try to pressure me at length to your preferred treatment, I may turn and walk away, and then you've actually, effectively failed.

I'm going to be very hesitant to ever set foot in an ER again, because the people there treated me very badly.  Their decision, to lecture an extremely sick patient, may eventually kill me.  I got over a bad drug interaction, but the damage from the ER is still here."

Talk to physicians and other providers and get their insight as far as lifestyle and job satisfaction.

However (takes breath before volley of arrows darkens the sky).  If you look at the expansion and the settlements as politics, and SodaStream as a business, I kinda don't see how employing a bunch of Palestinians for a decent wage is SUCH a huge negative.  

SodaStream are trespassing on sovereign territory.  Yes, but we open factories in Mexico.  They are exploiting a desperate labor force. We do that here at home in the states. The company does not have Palestinian managers.  Not yet, perhaps.  They claim to have engineers.

Integration of the communities is the ANSWER.  Integrated businesses are the ANSWER (whether they are in Palestine, in ""Israel"", or in Israel).  Frankly, MONEY for Palestinians seems a more pressing need than political status.  

From what I have (briefly) read, most of the Palestinians who work there oppose the boycott and are happy to have the job, the health insurance, the self-respect.

The company must live by its stated goals of taking care of its employees.  It's NOT up to them to unfuck Israel's sick politics.

I'm open to hearing more, but as of now, I don't see SodaStream as some arm of the Israeli expansion. I see them as a start.  I think this boycott is misguided.

I can tell you this, you don't really need strength to beat 4kings. Do it SOLO (more summons = more max HP on each king). Max your pyromancy glove as high as you can, or get a really strong +5 fire (or even +10 or +5chaos) weapon. If you go the glove, use great combustion/combustion. Spam them. GC can take out one king easily at ~+13 glove, but +5 ascended will leave you with enough casts to chew most of the 2nd king out as well. Go full havels, stand as close a possible, and try not to take any magic attack directly to the face (crest shield or dark hand will block a TON of the damage). Getting the shield to +5 is also useful.

Honestly, I disagree. Having her as just a friend when you want more is like torturing yourself. You might be *content* with the friendship, but I doubt you'll be truly happy. Hell, over time, that might change - but if you have feelings for her I would avoid being friends.

You made a decent move. I would have just gone in for the kiss after the movie. You have nothing to lose really. There are plenty of women out there and you'll get over her pretty quick if she rejects you. In my experience, women who ask you out and are willing to spend one on one time with you are testing you out for date material. Each women has a different test with different answers. Sometimes you just have to go for it and hope for the best.

tl;dr - If she rejects you, cut your losses and call it a day. No sense in pretending to be only interested in a friendship when you want more."

If you're missing all three you may be living in a van down by the river.

I extend that to my own life. As a kid I was mentally, physically and sexually abused by one or the other of my parents. I failed in two suicide attempts. No one noticed or cared at the time. When I met the woman who became my wife, six weeks into dating her I was diagnosed with cancer, and it was in stage III (it was spreading beyond the local tissue). I beat it twice...just in time for those same abusive parents to steal my identity and take out $40k in credit cards in my name just as I was finishing grad school (which I had received grant funding for), planning a wedding and couldn't a job in the post-downturn economy (2009). 

Luck finally shone down on me as my inlaws are awesome people and insisted I live with them as I sort all that shit out. I didn't go to the cops about the fraud because my dad said that the end result would be that he'd go to jail, but my mom would wind up on the street. Had I known that it was mother's idea to stick me with the plastic debt, I wouldn't have filed for bankruptcy, but that's what happened. That is how I started married life and when people ask me why I will never forgive my parents: that's why.

So, that's the hole I was in. Jobless, penniless, living off the kindness of my inlaws. After 15 months of nary a McJob and my confidence and self-worth being at a dangerously low, self-harming level, I finally got a job, and it was in my field...in Edmonton, Alberta. 3500km away from everyone and everything I'd ever known. My wife and I made a pact a long time before that, that whoever got the first job, wherever it was, that's where we would go. It was a year contact, but off we went.

In my first two years (I was renewed once) I volunteered for everything under the sun to give myself more exposure on this or that committee. As I was nearing my two years, I was told that I wasn't going to be renewed because of union rules (they don't want anyone on as effective permanent temps, I get it). I also had just had an interview for a job in a different branch than my own to work in their Executive Director's Office. I didn't get that interview because he had someone in mind who was already doing the job in relief, but he said I had made a formality into a difficult decision. I then asked him if there was something he could do to get me to stay on. He said that he was surprised that my current branch would let someone like me go and said he would talk to HR and I should hear something in a week or two. 

Three days later I did get that call and asked if I'd be interested in being extended three months (at least). I obviously said yes. Six weeks into that job, I got a permanent one with a slight raise. When I told my then manager, our Executive Director said the door was always open for my return. A job actually came up there in December. The Exec Dir himself (as did both hiring managers) came up to me as told me to apply when we were chatting at the AGM (annual general meeting), so I did...and I got it, along with an extra $5000 a year that they didn't have to offer me contractually, but that the ED approved in case of a salary freeze in April.

5 months ago I was a dead man walking, researching what the process was to file for Employment Insurance, and reworking our household budget to reflect the new reality, and as of next month, including benefits, I'll be making over six figures a year...not because I willed it to happen, not because I'm that good, and not because I'm lucky, but because I'm all three. Most people don't have the opportunity TO have the opportunity have all three, and that's what keeps me humble about this and not callous or looking down on others in a ""I did, so you must be a lazy fuck"" kinda way. This was hard work, sure, but I had an awful lot of interdependent luck along the way."

kornberg,relationships,1391111974.0,"Sucks kid but that's how it is. I am married to a guy who games professionally off and on and I put my foot down with LoL. 

He didn't play any more or less than he usually plays games but the person he became while he was playing was just awful. You have to focus entirely on the game to play so if I went in and asked him if he wanted something or said hi when I came home from work or asked him to please help me, the attic door just fell down and spilled a thousand bugs everywhere, he would be very hostile and short with me. I know that is because of the game's attention requirements but I was finally fed up and asked him to stop playing. 

It's not the time or the act of playing, it's how you act about the game. Describing yourself as ""passionate"" and talking about playing professionally really makes me think that your dad did not like how you were acting about this game. 

I also do not believe your assertion that you played less than 2 hours a day and were also plat 3. And if you want to get good enough to play professionally, you'd have to play 8+ hours a day. Then you'd move in with your team and play 14+ hours a day. And then you'd have to retire at 22. Pro gaming sucks and it's not a career. Keep games as a hobby.

Your dad is doing this because he doesn't like you playing this game and unfortunately, doesn't know enough about games to know that the problem is the type of game and not games as a whole. Acting like a teenager and saying that it's not faaaaair isn't going to help your case. Do well in school, stick with your other stuff and help out around the house. Tell your dad that you are going to prove to him that you're responsible enough to have this hobby and then do it. It may or may not work but it's the best chance you have. "

Studies are starting to show that vapes are not a ""gateway"" to cigs. That is a bullshit fear mongering thing stupid people say.

In your case yes nicotine is addictive, but it is not nearly as addictive as a cig, and in my opinion healthier."

Lots of people wait as long as possible to wash in order to go for higher contrast fades. Though I feel like the general consensus is wash them if they seem dirty. Washing is really up to you. Do it ask much as you like.

You should always buy good fitting jeans. Fit is pretty key.

Jynweythekylow,birthcontrol,1391112791.0,"So I'm taking orsythia (I'm going through a free clinic as I've just moved to another state and i don't have a job or insurance.) I had already been off of birth control for probably almost a month before i was able to get back on the pill. I had my urine tested the same day i saw the lady at the clinic, just to make sure i hadn't gotten pregnant in that window of time. Not pregnant. 

I was due to start bleeding in the seven to ten day range but i took my first pill from the pack that same day, so I'd already started my regimen when my period did start, just a few days maybe a week later.

Now I've taken all the pills for the month and all I have left are placebos. I'm probably just gonna take the placebos cause I've already managed to confuse myself on how to take birth control. I'm 23, been taking bc for years never had problems. :/

Thanks for your thoughts, helpful much. :)  "

PlushieChomby,AdviceAnimals,1391112838.0,"That sucks ass. Yeah, my friend when I was in high school was about 5'1"" or 5'2"", and when he asked the bouncer to give him back his ID if he wasn't going to let him in, the guy told him to ""fuck off"" and kept it. He tried calling the place to get it back, they laughed and hung up on him. Even offered to bring down his birth certificate to prove he was the age his license said he was, but they totally disregarded it in classic asshole move style. I felt so bad for him, they were suck dicks about everything. I like to think (read: pretend, maybe) they're under different management now and aren't a bunch of twats anymore, but even an ex of mine managed to get himself kicked out a few years back when, ten minutes after a fight where some bitch smashed a beer bottle into another guy's head, my ex picked up the broken bottle pieces still laying about on the floor and threw them in the trashcan. The bouncers (who'd done nothing to clean up that shit themselves while people were stepping on and around the glass shards all over the floor) kicked him out for touching the broken glass, even though he was helping by throwing it out. 

With idiots, you just can't win, period. "

JulepMint,AskReddit,1391112840.0,It was night time. I was still in high school. My mother and I were walking to the store and some men approached us stuck a gun out and told us to give them our money. I had a little coin purse (which I loved) and gave it to them. I was so scared. But they took it and left.  They must have been very upset when they looked inside the coin purse only had change. No paper money. That's what forced me to learn to drive.
