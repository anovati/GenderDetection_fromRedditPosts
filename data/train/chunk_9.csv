Horses are a lot stronger and tougher and more bendy than you would think. 

But if you think about it, they are built in proportion to their size, so what would happen if you did the same thing. Some bruising and soreness, you'd limp for a few days, maybe a visit or 2 to the chiropractor. It's sort of the same for the horse.

Last time my horse did this (I wasn't on him, but the saddle was), all he needed was a week off, some rub downs with warm water and lineament oil and an adjustment. The saddle caused some bruising, but nothing too bad. "

EByrne,nfl,1389030015.0,"100% agree. Dalton's in any QB's dream scenario. Pretty much the only way it could get any better is if Eifert and Marvin Jones continue to improve. But he just turns the ball over way, way too much.

In my book, if you throw 20 interceptions in a season, then the absolute ceiling for that season is that it was 'pretty good'. So even in an ideal situation, he's a QB who can put up numbers but turns the ball over way too much. And he's showing no signs of turning the corner, either. Each year that he's been in the league, his total interceptions and INT% have gone up, as he's been asked to assume more responsibility. 

That's just not good enough, and do we really have any reason to think that the fault for that doesn't lie with him? He is what he is: a quarterback surrounded by a ton of weapons who turns the ball over way, way too much. In 17 games this year, he turned the ball over 26 times. "

* 1350 RP - Skins in the 1350 RP tier will feature a new model, textures, splash image, visual effects and sounds. In some cases, these skins will also have processed voice overs.

**Robotics;Notes** [22/22]

So yeah, this happened. Pretty much everything up until the three-quarter mark was great - both the conspiracy and robot construction elements were interesting, and couples with a strong soundtrack, actually kept me guessing the entire time about what would happen. It's not often that I can marathon a show so easily; the last was, I think, *Girls und Panzer.* Everything about the first season and most of the second half was great, although the awkward tonal dissonance between episodes as they switched between the super robot and conspiracy plot-lines was weird (exacerbated by marathoning, it wouldn't have been so bad if I watched them only once a week.) I always had the niggling fear in the back of my head that they may not be able to contain all the plot threads into a proper ending, but I dismissed those fears, that it would be fine. 

Then that ending happened. Now, I'm not against happy shounen ""ganbarre!"" endings. What I *am* against is a happy shounen ""ganbarre!"" ending in a show that should more serious than that, one that invalidates a lot of the heaviness that preceded it. I think this is one of the best examples of a show that bit off more than it could chew and had to let shit spill everywhere, because that ending felt so messy and un-good. Several characters were waving so many death flags that it looked like the outside of the United Nations' NY headquarters, and yet didn't die. Apparently a massive pseudo-Illuminati organization can only obtain like one giant robot, and sends it as the only guard for a launch site that is the major hinge in their plans, and apparently you can get through to people who have been brainwashed for a decade by shouting loud enough, and just...ugh. Those random magnetic monopoles that fell out of the sky never get explained (I'll leave aside the stupidity that is ""building a motor"" out of them like that's something any JAXA engineer can do in his spare time.) Goddamit, *Robotics;Notes*, I wanted to love you to the end. I wanted to. But...I can't. What were you thinking?

On the character front, I'm happy to say that most of the characters are pretty enjoyable. I found Kona's otaku mannerisms much more grating than I did Daru's, although I felt she had the most romantic spark with Kai (although, him and Aki getting together was sort of inevitable so I'm not bothered). Kai himself is still a mixed bag, as it often felt like the show was actively forcing him to switch personalities to be active and explore the conspiracy when it was pretty clear all he wanted to do was hang around and play Kill-Ballad. 

Honestly, as much as I gripe about the ending and how unfulfilling it felt, I still thoroughly enjoyed everything else about it. I'd normally give something like that 6, but I'll bump it to an ""ambitious and entertaining but highly flawed"" 7. I think if you loved *Steins;Gate* (both that and *Robotics;Notes*, along with *Chaos;Head*, are part of the nitroplus/5pb's Science Adventure series), you'd enjoy *Robotics;Notes*, although probably to a lesser degree.

**Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru (series and OVA)** [13/13 - Rewatch]

This show was, surprisingly, not as much fun to watch the second time. My theory on this is that the discussion threads analyzed this show to the death when it first came out, which means there's very few little details to look out for that can make a rewatch interesting. The show, while very interesting when it first came out, doesn't have a lot going for it besides it's story - the art is bland and there's no bombast, fights or anything super dramatic. A little disappointing, but that doesn't diminish the fact that this was one of the best shows of the year. 

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** [17/64 - Rewatch]

I needed a break from moving boxes and lifting shit, so while I waited for my internet to come back, I went ahead and began a rewatch of one of the most beloved shounens out there, and a personal favorite of mine: *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood*. It's still the only one that can make me cry at the drop of a hat - [the second Uso started playing, it was like one of those anime-only moments where I put my hands up to my face and realized I was tearing up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mUcDMZviJY)

That said, though, it's been a couple years since I watched it, so changing tastes have made things a little harder to watch. In particular the humor seems more repetitive and stupid than before. Thankfully, unlike *Gin no Saji*, Arakawa's humor isn't nearly as in your face in this series.

marinersalbatross,MapPorn,1389030786.0,"The reason I include suicides with gun violence is because of the rate of suicide survival when a firearm is not involved is much higher and thereby allows better access to mental health treatment.  Suicide is normally an impulsive act and with ready access to a firearms has a higher mortality than other methods. By lowering access to guns by those with mental illness you can open doors to treatment. 

Dealing with Japan and their suicide rate is a fallacious argument, because I could just as easily bring up Finland and their high access to firearms and high rates of suicide. There is also the cultural differences in how the Japanese view suicide compared to the US. Or maybe I could just bring up a peer reviewed study.

As the study above shows, it does make an impact. Much like how vaccines work, not on the whole but on a percentage of those treated.

If society doesn't get a say, then society quite literally *doesn't get a say* in what constitutes a valid marriage.  And while this is well and good from a philosophical standpoint (I have no problem if someone wants to *claim* they are married to 300 other people, or their car, or whatever), it becomes a problem when we start talking about state and federal marriage benefits.  At that point, when we start giving away money and other benefits to claimants of a marriage, then society starts to get a say in what sorts of marriages they want to condone."

However, what I've learned here will be useful elsewhere and allow me to move into other more fitting positions in fields I might like better.

i_am_a_freethinker,mormon,1389031140.0,"&gt;I've tried to explain it repeatedly

You've done a terrible job of it, then. Let's keep in mind D&amp;C 77:6

&gt;earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.

What have you explained temporal to be? Well,

&gt;Mortal is a subset of temporal.

&gt;Cancer and tsunamis are part of a temporal life.

&gt;While in the Garden, Adam/Eve had a non-temporal existence

All of which I agree with! Now let's expand.

When did the Earth's temporal existence begin? When Adam and Eve ate the fruit. What does a temporal existence include? Natural catastrophies and the ability to be mortal and to die.

What else do we know about life in the Garden? Well, in the 2010 Gospel Principles manual, page 28: 

&gt;When Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden of Eden, they were not yet mortal. In this state, “they would have had no children” (2 Nephi 2:23). There was no death. They had physical life because their spirits were housed in physical bodies made from the dust of the earth (see Moses 6:59; Abraham 5:7). They had spiritual life because they were in the presence of God. They had not yet made a choice between good and evil. 

So, they had physical bodies, yet could not reproduce and could not die. Here we learn that physical != temporal. Again, you and I agree.

What does the Bible Dictionary have to say? 

&gt;Latter-day revelation teaches that there was no death on this earth for any forms of life before the fall of Adam. Indeed, death entered the world as a direct result of the fall (2 Nephi 2:22; Moses 6:48).

Again! No death before the fall. No death **on this earth for *any* forms of life** before the fall of Adam.

What is the inevitable conclusion?

* Temporal existence began when the fruit was consumed
* Death did not exist before the the Fall
* Without death, evolution makes no sense, therefore
* Evolution didn't happen
* Further, since the temporal existence didn't begin until 6,000 years ago, that's how old the temporal (mortal) Earth is. Fossils are misleading. Fossil fuels mean nothing. Science is wrong.

This is all clear from both the Doctrine and Covenants, Book of Mormon, and modern prophets.

Remember when I said that there were ""Chapel Mormons"" and ""Internet Mormons""? All of the above a Chapel Mormon would agree with.

It is a common tactic of apologists to redefine words. ""Oh, 'horses' don't actually mean 'horses',"" ""'Written by his own hand' doesn't actually mean Abraham wrote it,"" ""'translating' doesn't mean a literal translation,"" ""Oh, the papyrus weren't 'translated,' they were a catalyst to a religious experience,'"" ad nauseum. This is what you've done to the word ""temporal."" Too bad this plain and precious gospel is so confusing.

I'm sorry that your faith's Doctrine is so troubling to you."

There's various other games that have featured rape stuff as backstory, like a supporting character in The Witcher 2 or a character in I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream. Metro Last Light has a woman getting attacked as one of the various mood setting elements (though it doesn't go through even if you don't interfer due to outside circumstances). 

Now, it's completely unclear how graphic/explicit this will be. And since it's described as an audiolog it's completely possible that this is easily skippable/additional character information rather than a huge part of the plot.

igotsacomputer,mississauga,1389031361.0,"I understand why our knee-jerk reaction to the idea of removing a lane of traffic is a negative one, but please take the time to look further into this issue. Hurontario is one of the GTA's busiest transit corridors. Thousands of people use public transit on Hurontario every single day to get around the city of Mississauga.

The LRT will form the backbone of our transit system, and its development is extremely important along a corridor which is only going to become increasingly dense. Not only is development continuing at a rapid pace around Square One, but there are plans to radically transform Cooksville and Hurontario/Eglinton. We need rapid transit to accommodate this growth in population. That's the conclusion which planners have come to, and they're the ones working with the cold, hard facts.

I remember attending a consultation on the Hurontario LRT a few years back. One man stood up to voice his complete disapproval of the entire project. He claimed that he saw empty buses on Hurontario every morning, and that there could therefore be no possible use for installing LRT. Planners assured him that they had the records to prove just how well-used transit was along the corridor, but he fell back repeatedly on personal anecdotes. The sound of groaning from other residents in attendance grew louder and louder.

Please, Mississaugans, don't vote against a project as important to the future of our city as this one on the basis of limited personal experience! Dig your teeth into the issue! Mississauga is one of the best positioned suburbs in North America when it comes to potential to reinvent ourselves. We can't mess this up. We need real, strong leadership at City Hall which will stand up against our knee-jerk scepticism and passionately communicate a vision for the transformation of (parts of) our city. I suspect that the degree to which visionaries win our support will depend on how well they're able to simultaneously assure people that they're not out to kill the suburb and transform every inch of the city into Old Toronto."

imnotminkus,personalfinance,1389031402.0,"$250,000 per depositor per bank is insured.  So, you'd have to split that among ~~[(total deposit)/$2 million]~~ [total deposit / $250,000] number of banks.  As others have said, having $2 million in checking/savings accounts doesn't really happen.

[Edit: The exception below of another ""account at the same bank might not be insured, depending on the type of account and the way the account was held"" applies here.]

Source:  http://www.bankrate.com/finance/savings/fdic-insures-bank-deposits-to-250-000-1.aspx

&gt;The biggest misconception about FDIC insurance is that it applies at the account level -- when in fact it applies at the depositor level, Sandler says. Here are two examples:

&gt;* A depositor who had 10 individual bank accounts of $25,000 each for a total of $250,000 at one bank would be fully insured up to $250,000. However, a depositor who had three individual accounts of $250,000 each for a total of $750,000 at one bank would be insured only to $250,000 and not to $750,000.

&gt;* A husband and wife who have one individual bank account of $250,000 each for a total of $500,000 and one joint account of another $500,000 at one bank would be fully insured to the total of $1 million. But a fourth account at the same bank might not be insured, depending on the type of account and the way the account was held. Customers whose accounts reach this level of complexity should call the FDIC to get expert advice that's tailored to their own situation.

I consider my self to be socially more-or-less centrist, and in general all over the spectrum when it comes to national or international issues. Most often moderately leftist.

&gt; Among the students though, most students are feminists, including the male students.

I think that's an exaggeration to a certain extent. Sure, there are some people in university who are stupidly feminist, especially the very worst of the third wave, but I feel that they're something like a very loud minority with a plurality of people who espouse partial feminist theory-- they still talk about concepts that are weak at best, but you can actually talk to them without being labled as a ""misogynist"" or other insults.

&gt; And almost everyone is pro-gay rights. 

Again, thankfully, I think it depends. I do dislike those who are militant LGBT and support the gays behaving as outlandishly as possible, and then these same people wouldn't give two shits about people dying en masse anywhere other then North America or far western Europe.

Anyways. One of my best friends is a guy. He's a fairly attractive guy, and I've been told I'm a rather attractive girl. He is also quite sexually frustrated; at almost-19, he's never gotten anything beyond a handjob, (and even that was a less-than-satisfactory experience for him). He hasn't had great luck with women, because of some personality issues that can cause him to be rather close-minded and make him not so great at relationships. So yeah, he's got some sexual tension going. 

But despite that, our friendship has been platonic since it started, and continues to remain that way. There is no sexual tension, and we are not attracted to one another at all; we've effectively friendzoned each other. We joke that it would be practically incest if we were to ever be sexual. We basically have a relationship similar to that of brother and sister. This is the nature of our friendship, and both of us have communicated that and are very happy with it. We advise each other; we're each others' wingmen; we support each other.

Again, this is, I think, fairly unique to us and our situation: we've known one another since the third grade, and such has been the way of our relationship since then. Knowing someone since childhood makes it much more difficult to view them sexually, which has probably helped our relationship stay so strongly platonic. So that's just some food for thought, but in my experience it is definitely possible."

How about 30-person?  3,000-person?  Where does it stop?

Why did it cost them their power?

&gt; arranged in arrays of concentric rings with Rinae at the center.

Do they just fall on rings, or are they arranged at certain angles at well? I would imagine all this planning would leave some - or many - towns in less-than-ideal locations. Some of the 40 will end up ghost towns, or nearly that, given enough time. In addition, the founding 'township' might end up at the far edge of a larger city, as it grows towards a more convenient place - like a river, lake, valley, etc. Are there laws stopping additional towns from forming? Unless they're very strict, expect both temporary and permanent 'camps' set up to exploit natural resources. They won't have legal status but they may end up quite powerful. And expect them to operate somewhat outside the law.

&gt; Ma'ashia is locked in a cold war with its eastern neighbor, Pi'ashia, an archipelagic country across the eastern sea.

While Pi'ashia will obviously be a maritime power, the Ma'ashians will need great navies to not only counter the Pi'ashians but also to protect their own interests. Coastal raiding and drives up rivers could seriously diminish trade.

On the same track, how big is Ma'ashia? While I usually disdain maps, some scribbles to see your idea might be nice, because I'm having trouble visualizing exactly. Law enforcement could end up problematic in a large state, because strongholds will end up near rivers to fight the Pi'ashians and protect capitol economic interests. You may end up with lawless or warlord-run wildernesses. It's a feudal kingdom, so such things are not unheard of.

&gt; The culture of Ma'ashia is similar to the cultures of China, Japan, and Korea here on Earth. 

These countries have dissimilar, and extremely deep, cultures. I'd take a couple hours, read up, and get a more nuanced view of them. Or, at least, don't frame them as ""like x,"" say specifically what features of culture you're thinking of.

hylandw,DnD,1389032573.0,"Typically crafts are based on average shipping (if you pay, otherwise they pay so don't include it), cost of resources (so wool, tools, etc. If you don't know the math, give me the data via PM and I can do some math) and desired, but reasonable, profit. Thus, if your needles and other equipment last you for 100 bags and cost about 50$, that's 50c per bag. If the yarn is 10$ for 30 bags, that's 34c. Since you'll probably be using several colours and types of yarn, let's bump that up to 1$. That means each bag costs 1.50$ in resources. Then add your wasted (used) time (maybe 3 hours (I don't really know how this works), at 2.50$ per hour, low since typically if you're doing this you're enjoying it, so 7:50$), giving you 9$. You can bump it up to about 10-15$ since people would be willing to pay (more if you prove that it's quality stuff). Since it's small-scale, you'll only be making petty cash, but if you go big you could buy bulk and automate the process... but that's probably not going to happen.

TL;DR: 10-15$, depending on costs and quality."

However, the c-section has more severe risks to you as a person than a vaginal delivery would. You should discuss the pros and cons with your doctor and just keep that conversation going as you head towards that stage in your life. Once you're actually knocked up, you may make different choices than you think you would now. 

Vaginal childbirth has been described to me as feeling like you need to take a huge dump. You have the contractions, which are short, acute cramps like you would get on your period and then there is actually pushing/birthing, which many women report that they don't feel the way they thought it would the first time. It's not fun but it's not like they implode from the pain--your body is pumping out a shitton of oxytocin and the second that kid is out, you will probably forget the labor pains and be a sappy, gushy new mom. 

That said, if I do have a kid, I am getting an elective c-section. I have absolutely no interest in dealing with any aspect of vaginal birth and that's ok. If someone has a negative opinion about my personal decision, they can go fuck themselves. "

mludd,AskReddit,1389032869.0,"Well, I've not been near such dry spells but it's really not that hard to find yourself in a situation where you're not constantly meeting new relatively attractive people of the opposite (or same) sex.

A week has 168 hours

First we deduct a reasonable amount of sleep, 8 hours per night or 56 hours in total. You now have 112 disposable hours.

Let's say you work 50 hours per week in an office with only coworkers of the same (or opposite if you're gay) sex as you, you're now down to 62 hours.

Oh, and 2.5 hours per week for lunch (at the office lunch room, you're already putting in ten hours of overtime per week, no time to waste heading out somewhere for lunch, you now have 59.5 hours left.

Your commute takes 30 minutes in each direction every day (possibly longer but let's assume you live relatively close to work), 57 hours left.

After work every day you go to the gym (and let's be honest, unless you're taking an intro spinning or zumba class you're probably not really meeting people, you're working out like 99% of the people there), you're no serious gym rat so let's say one hour four days per week. You now have 53 hours left.

Oh, but getting to the gym comes out to another 2 hours per week, 51 hours still available to you.

And I left out breakfast and getting ready in the morning, unless you're still in college or scheduling-challenged that's at least another 30 minutes per day, 48.5 hours left.

Dinner takes you 45 minutes per day in total. 44.75 hours per week left.

Don't forget grocery shopping and random household chores. If you're not a slob chances are you put at least a couple of hours into this every week. Let's assume 3 hours. You now have 41.75 hours per week left to use as you please.

Ah, but then there are things like laundry where you're essentially at the mercy of the washing machine because you don't want to just leave your clothes in there for hours while you're out somewhere so let's tack on another two hours for annoying things like that. 39.75 hours left.

And if you're closing in on 30 you can bet there's at least one social function per week where you're only around your already coupled-up friends which eats at least five hours of your time. 34.75 hours left.

You now have an average of 4 hours and 58 minutes per day that's actually your free time, this includes any time for hobbies, watching TV, returning books to the library, helping that friend of yours move to his new apartment, take your car to the shop, play video games and meet members of the opposite sex.

And let's say that as part of your ""meet people"" strategy you hit the bars or go to a party every weekend, well that's a decent-sized affair, chances are you'll be effectively busy from 6 pm to around 3 am, nine hours in all. You're now down to 25.75 hours per week of free time (3 hours 41 minutes per day).

And this is just living a normal single life with a full-time job that requires a little overtime now and again.

I really like Ridley Scott so maybe Exodus won't suck.  The story has been rehashed in film so many times that I really, really doubt he'll have any new things to add to the story.  For example, the article says it will focus on the relationship between Moses and Ramses, which ""hasn't been done before,"" even though Prince of Egypt did the same thing, and was a pretty good movie for both children and adults.  My prediction: Exodus will be perfectly watchable and fun, but probably won't do much with the story that we haven't seen before.

I'm 100% certain that ""Son of God"" will be terrible.  It has essentially nothing going for it.  The preview actually made me kind of want to watch it in an ironic ""look-how-bad-this-movie-is"" sort of way.

Regular BC, by contrast, is a low-dose, long-term medication; the two, physiologically, function in fundamentally different ways.

Here's an example.  If you take 81mg of aspirin daily and you have high blood pressure, your blood pressure will come down, gradually, over the course of several months and reduce your overall risk of heart attack.  This dose will do nothing whatsoever for pain relief, because the amount is below an effectiveness threshold.  By contrast, if you take three 200mg aspirin pills once a week, you'll get a nice, powerful dose of pain relief and a notable thinning of your blood, but no change in your overall risk for heart attack, *even though you're taking the same amount of aspirin over the course of the week*.  The same drug, administered in different ways, can have radically different effects."

GhostsofDogma,AskMen,1389033465.0,"Yes, definitely, but it can be hard to differentiate, so I might fuck this up. I have some myself, and it seems sort of like the difference between... Well, you know how seeing someone attractive and seeing them naked are two different states? Like in terms of how the latter is more closely tied to arousal?

For a person with a fetish concerning a bodytype, the feeling when you see someone that fits that is more sexual and intense, like the comparison above. A fetish feels a lot more like an obsession where there are very strong emotional connotations to the subject... Although it is very sexual to the person, it's not quite linked directly to sex itself. It's less that you see someone attractive and want to have intercourse, and more that you tunnel-vision onto the subject of the fetish. (Although there are plenty of fetishes that concern having sex in a specific *manner*- Sadomasochism for example- but that's where it gets messy.)


 Because of that, it's less ""I want him in me"" and more, ""I could probably orgasm just from running my hands along his bones."" (I'm using my own example as I can't really speak for people into fat. I'm into deathly thin guys :S Weird, I know.) Most people will want both, of course, and they build off of each other a lot, but you can tell if you have them that they're two separate impulses. But there are plenty of people that have a fetish by the traditional sense wherein they can't be aroused by anything else and won't be interested in intercourse.

So yeah, that's why it kinda kills me when people say they have a ""fetish"" for red heads, because every time I see it it's only expressed as 'I like when girls have red hair'. You're not obsessed with red hair itself, you just consider girls with red hair to be the most attractive. A lot of times people will say they have a fetish out of being insecure over having a preference/type that they perceive to be rare and shunned but that actually isn't. "

RoseOfSharonCassidy,TrollXChromosomes,1389033607.0,"Those are caused by [prostaglandins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin), which (among other things) cause contraction of the uterus.  This is good for your period because it will cause the uterus to contract and expel the endometrium.  Unfortunately, prostaglandins sometimes get a little bit ""carried away"" [and also cause contraction of the bowels](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1409762), leading to gastrointestinal problems during your period.  They are also linked to [excessive bleeding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3481084) and [menstrual migraines](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2714974), but it is unclear whether they actually cause these issues or a spike in PG is just correlated with the problems.

Fortunately, [prostaglandin inhibition is very easy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin#Inhibition)!  NSAIDs inhibit the production of prostaglandins.  [Naproxen sodium was shown to be paricularly effective](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6571974).  Because your body begins producing prostaglandins [before your period actually starts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1546064), you should begin to inhibit them before your period starts.  To do this, all you have to do is take some naproxen sodium (aleve, midol, store-brand, whatever) once a day for 3 days before your period starts.  You will see a huge reduction in ""period poops"" along with many other typical period symptoms.  The trick is that you have to do this before your period actually starts!  Most people just take painkillers during their period, but if you start with an NSAID before it starts, it'll help much more.

tl;dr: prostaglandins suck, take midol for 3 days before your period starts and you won't get period poops."

Particularly in WW2, germany and italy got all of the benefits of a neutral neighbour - a back channel to talk to the allies through, and a neutral party to handle red cross type stuff.  Switzerland isn't all that important strategically given that the axis had the  place surrounded, eventually a German-Italian dominated Europe would have folded Switzerland into their empire eventually, but that could easily wait.

&gt;Are you a jeep owner by wild chance? My family has 2.

I have owned a jeep.  It never caught fire.  I however did not drive it in sand because sand destroys engines... so does salt water.  Combine the two and you get a nasty little fire starter.  Retail jeeps are not meant for joyriding in sand dunes.  You have to fix your car up for that to avoid fire.

&gt;I don't think its unreasonable to expect a jeep to be able to handle sand without catching on fire.

You shouldn't be allowed to own a jeep.

&gt;I don't think its unreasonable to expect a jeep to be able to handle sand without catching on fire.

Unless you have an old ass jeep I do not understand how you could think this.

LolaRuns,Cynicalbrit,1389035234.0,"I get his point about UI, but I personally think it might make the screen too cluttered to move it all into one screen. 

I feel like the big skills screen actually makes you consider learning something just because you get a bonus for it. While with his suggestion (tooltip when you click on the skills) would force you to click on all tooltips to figure out which bonus/malus each one has. 

That said, maybe it could be done by hovering across the mood? But then there's the factor that the boni are not just dependent on the mood but how much you have studied in that subgroup already. 

But I think a tooltip on the mood screen could be nice to preview what each one affects and you could still have an additional line in the tooltips on the classes screen for the current bonus. But I wouldn't get rid of the big skill screen alltogether because it would still give a better overview of all the current boni without having to click on each skill. That said, it could be prettier. And personally, my wish/dream would be like a map screen of the kingdom that slowly fills up with information maybe as you study in these subject matters. (but I think the dev has hinted that they would consider that as making the game too easy or making people too focused on obsessing over the information) 

/end UI thoughts

________________

I know it's a matter of taste but the staticness of the story elements actually reminds me a bit of let's say a torture platformer. It has to be static so you can memorize the level layout so to speak. 

Because personally, even though I have played the game quite a bit and I have beaten it a couple of times, I still find myself failing a lot (kinda like TB noting he died again even though he knew the event was coming) because I get lazy. Aka I have this strategy in my head of what I think will work but there is something I overlooked or I can't get the mood boni right and something trips me. Aka there's some of the more obscure paths (stupid forest adventure) I've never been able to get even though I know what is coming up and I have a rough idea of what I have to do to get them/what the important checks are. 

I know I keep saying that, but I keep visualizing the game as a very strange math puzzle, and that clashes with people who walk into the game expecting a more intuitive, RPG like experience. :D "
atheistium,rpg_gamers,1389035238.0,"Yes because protecting intellectual property is a bad thing ;)

You'd be surprised how a fan made game (if terrible) can damage perceptions of a product. Reason why companies protect their IPs so vigorously.

While most of us know the difference there are too many dumbos who don't :,( and you'd be shocked how much hassle that causes. Like when people buy a pre-owned 3ds and then blame Nintendo when there is dodgy content on the memory card.

MillenniumFalc0n,SubredditDrama,1389035818.0,"I think the difference with this ama is that she wasn't as ""pr"" focused as a lot of amas are.  She didn't just ignore anything that made her angry.  She responded more like a real person than someone just trying to maintain a pleasant-sounding public persona.  I think a possible reason she comes off sounding rude or unpleasant is that you might be subconsciously comparing her to other amas you've read where the answerer usually avoids such situations. I personally found her frankness refreshing

Edit: See this comment

&gt;thanks. Yeah, that's only my personality on reddit. Unfortunately this seems to be the website where every troll who gets kicked out of another place for being an asshole comes to congregate. As far as I've read (and I've read EVERY comment and question) about 70% of users here are total douchebags. Of course I'm going to be bitchy! I'm one of the most kind, tolerant people you'd ever meet in person. I have an incredibly high tolerance for asshole behavior, but this is the most hostile group of people I've ever been exposed to.

During the sixth week of development, brainwave activity begins. By the time an embryo is 8 weeks old, it has enough of a central nervous system to not only be moving around (and we're talking subtle movements like opening the mouth and squinting the eyes, not just thrashing an arm or a leg), but to be able to touch its own face and rub its hands and feet together, and to move in response to being touched. Not only is some form of nervous system required to be able to move at all, but to move in response to being touched *also* requires some nervous system development. It isn't as developed as it will be, but you're wrong to say there is no central nervous system yet, because there *is*."

Application fee is usually nonrefundable and part of it pays for a credit check, and the deposit should be returned to you within a month after you move out.  Some utilities (i.e. electric, gas) require a deposit of 1-2 months' worth of normal bills, and that's refunded to you with interest after you move out.  Some cable/internet companies may require a deposit depending on your credit, how much equipment they give you, etc.  Be sure it's refundable - AT&amp;T U-Verse does shady things related to this, so I'd stay away from them if possible.

However, I think there's something to be said about *the level* of densification. Factors like the feel of the city and things being built on a human scale need to be taken into account. Giant towers make some people feel trapped in the city.

One thing I think should be considered is medium-density low-rise buildings (4-6 stories). However, from a developer's perspective, you'd need to secure lots of small projects and pieces of land instead of a few big ones."

Madame-Ovaries,AskWomen,1389037066.0,"I'm currently in therapy. My biggest advice is to find someone you really like. I had to go through 3 people to find someone I clicked with. Don't settle. And remember to be totally, 100% honest. You won't get better if you hold back. 

At times, it will be very uncomfortable. You will want to cry, scream, stop talking all together, and feel like you're exploding with emotion, or void of it all together. But that's the point: you're working *through* those issues. 

My therapist gives me homework. She gives me small goals. For instance, we talked about how I want to exercise to help with my anxiety. However, I have never been to the gym on campus, and I feel anxious about going new places. So, my homework for this week is to go to the gym on campus and just look around. Find out where the lockers are. Push myself outside my comfort zone a little bit towards something that will ultimately benefit me.

Also, before I started therapy, I kept a mood journal. This was extremely helpful because I was dealing with bipolar tendencies, and it helped my therapist and psychiatrist diagnose me because I could give them time frames. By documenting your mood, feelings, etc with dates, not only will you be able to possibly figure out triggers for bad feelings, but also it will help your therapist track patterns in your feelings.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! I'm very glad I've returned to therapy. "

You don't have any sexual encounters that you regret. You don't have to worry about having an unwanted child with a woman you don't love. That's something that many other people out there can't say. The only ""con"" to waiting is that you might find yourself feeling a little randy sometimes. Otherwise it's all good, and nothing to be ashamed about or to merit scorn from others. When you finally meet the woman with whom it all falls into place, you won't regret it."

I found many bugs during compatibility testing that were real bugs in the original implementation that I just hadn't discovered yet.

Perhaps some developers just feel reassured at the quality of their software when they can get it to work on both Windows and SteamOS?

There's also the advantage of having experience with SteamOS before it becomes the next big console platform.

benk4,nfl,1389037564.0,"&gt; I don't understand why anyone would give that up only to roll the dice on a couple young guns.

Because it's more likely to be good for the long term health of the team.  4 more good years out of Brady is a best case scenario. Very few QBs play well until they're 40.  I'd view keeping Brady more as rolling the dice than trading him.  His trade value is only declining.  

If we got 2 first rounders for him we could probably package the 2 with our own and move up to a very high pick and get a young gun, who would be on a significantly lower salary than Brady for the next 4 years.  This would give us room to resign other key players.  

Look at the NFL right now.  There seems to be 2 types of teams in the playoffs.  Teams with an old veteran QB, and teams with a young QB on a cheap deal.  Trading Brady would be taking the latter route and would set us up long term.    "

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389037574.0,"&gt; This is unfortunately why developers rarely bother to make very different endings. They simply know that completionists are rare, and even among them, few are going to experience alternate endings.

But even if there aren't enough people who want two endings, what if there is a signficant number of people who would strongly prefer ending A and a significant number of people who would prefer ending type B? Like let's say riding off into the sunset into freedom alone vs. ending up with your love interest? Supporting the king vs. starting a revolution? Being a bad guy who everybody fears vs. always getting a goodguy ending? Embracing technology or embracing nature etc. 

Even if endings is something one can agree on, divergent storylines cover much more. I would argue that there's probably at least different groups for people who prefer a more peaceful/diplomatic approach and ones who prefer a more aggressive/directly violent one. "

Learn how to pronounce the letters č, š and ž right away (but don't be disappointed if you can't pronounce just right, the Slovenes I spent time with said they'd never before met a foreigner who was capable of pronouncing their language). 

Also, if you get a dictionary, make sure it's one that'll mark the main syllable in the word, trust me, it makes a huge difference. I originally picked one out that didn't but the shopkeeper helped me find one that was much better (so I'm not entirely sure you could find it online but maybe). 

There are cases and there are several extra personal pronouns, I'd advise you familiarize yourself with those a little. I guess none of that is resources, just advice. 

On the bright side, I came across a ton of people who couldn't speak English or just a few words, so any amount that you manage to learn will probably be helpful in some situations. Make sure you memorize some food names, as the menus at restaurants are often not translated so that would certainly be useful.

Society gets to decide what is OK, and what is not OK.  Except where the state and federal constitutions reserve fundamental rights, society is free to discriminate between behaviors it wants to promote and behaviors it doesn't.  This is what laws are, a lot of the time.

Is it OK that society chooses to treat farmers un-equally, by subsidizing some types of crops and not others?  Sure, it's fine because there is no fundamental, constitutionally-protected right to grow whatever crop you want in an unfettered free market.  Same argument here with regards to marriage.

Spurgeon can (and does) routinely lead a rush up ice or jump into the play deep in the offensive zone, whereas Suter is more reserved to pass the puck to his forwards or chip the puck back deep into the offensive zone.  Not to say that either way is bad or good, it's just a different style of play.  

He also seems to be the team's leading shooter on the power play, though I have no numbers to back that up.

Figures all the more troubling that among employees who have been convicted, nine of them were working with optometrists who are executive officers or occupy strategic positions in the Order

Look at catholics eating fish when meat is not allowed I believe this is due to the latin background of carne=meat which is defined as land animals or some such.  Many other religion view fish in the same way as well, look at Jewish Kosher law.

I've had to retrain horses who have had this ""training"" done to them; it takes years and honestly I would never consider a horse with this ""training"" as being completely and 100% safe, even years later, and personally would always wear a protective vest riding one even if it hadn't reared in a decade.  Once they have learned this behavior, they can always be scared into doing it again."

wooq,KerbalSpaceProgram,1389038807.0,"The technical reason is that a [tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29) is a data structure, a collection of parent-child relationships.  Any part can have only one parent part, otherwise you open the door to all kinds of illogical hierarchical arrangements, like a part being its own parent or an infinite loop of parent-child-parent-child.

Imagine you can connect all four, top and bottom.  Logically, what do you think should happen if you click on one of the four engines, then?  Does the rest of the rocket below that engine come off as a part no matter which engine you click on?  Well, then, you have four nodes extending from the parent part, all four of which have the same properties.  So how should you get a part count for your rocket?  How do you determine it's mass?  Not by counting or simple addition, you would have to write all kinds of conditional stuff to determine which nodes/parts were duplicates set up from having multiple parents.  And that's just for this constrained circumstance.  If you make a circle of girders, what happens when you attach the last one to both the first girder and the second to last one?

* So little of the animal goes to waste - which is why we eat tripe, chicken feet, and liver.  
* Eating out was a huge deal when I was young. My working class parents cooked dinner ~350 days of the year.

The blue one should probably say ""spells that can't be countered can't be cast"" as that is how uncounterable spells are worded. Even so, you would need to speak to a judge to make sure it makes rules sense.

I don't think the black one works- you could reword it to ""at the beginning of the first upkeep, each player sacrifices all permanents they control that aren't named Leyline of Repulsion."" Since it doesn't do anything besides be sacrificed once the game begins.

Why the nonlegendary restriction on the green one? It seems unnecessary and a little jarring. Does it break some card I am not aware of? Otherwise, it's great.

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389039275.0,"So most people who know a little about Jewish history know that the Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. And those know know a little more know that a Third Temple is a major part of Jewish eschatology, though some more liberal sects don't believe in it anymore (Reform Judaism, mostly).  And many people know that the modern consensus is that it shouldn't be built until the messiah arrives.

But that consensus exists for a reason--failed attempts at building the Third Temple.  The first attempt was in 135, during the Bar Kochba revolt.  It failed when the rebellion did.

A more interesting one is from the 4th century.  Emperor Julian allowed the Jews to reconstruct it.  However, there was an earthquake, which damaged the construction.  There's also a lot of talk about weird supernatural fire of some sort burning things down/burning workers.  The result was that it failed, and the basic concept that God doesn't want the Temple rebuild yet took hold."

You deciding to always have free time, always fix her stuff, never initiate anything sexual, and always accommodate her emotional needs without asking for the same is really, really not normal. That's not a normal expectation of a relationship in which there's an income disparity. If you were earning more than a woman you dated, is that what you'd expect her to be like? Because that's not cool.

Money exists outside the relationship dynamic. It affects it in the way it affects the rest of your life (like, maybe you can't afford that fancy gift you wanted to surprise her with, or maybe one partner is stressed about making rent payments or something) but it isn't some special condition of the relationship itself. Seeing it otherwise is pretty unhealthy IMO."

duggtodeath,WTF,1389039338.0,"The mother here has not demonstrated that she has any control in the first place. She probably is trying to be their friend at home and the kids show no respect. I also doubt that taking an at-risk child and beating them will make them fly right. Studies show that it just makes bad kids do bad things to other people when they get older. It also sexually confuses some children as well. We only teach them that violence is a solution to problems. This family needs serious help, but I cannot support domestic violence as a solution. Beating kids into conformity is quite possibly the most psychopathic thing I've read all day. Congratulations. Hitting someone who can't fight back isn't child-rearing, its violent bullying.

Oh, and this isn't just an uninformed opinion. I cannot find one scientific study that suggests beating up family members is good practice and will result in a better behaved adult. You just make them fear you while also telling them you hurt them because you love them. Sounds like an abusive spouse to me."

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389039379.0,"From 1980 until 88 Iraq was at war with Iran.  This cost a small mountain of money, much of which was borrowed, including from Kuwait.  Iraqi oil production went down, Kuwaiti oil production went up.  

Now Kuwait used to be a centre of trade, but that declined (notably with the Suez  Canal).  Kuwait was kinda sort but not really independent from the Ottomans.   Somewhat like Egypt actually.  They ended up in practice as an overseas dependency of the UK in the late 1700's even though there were in many respects separate.  But at the time the UK didn't take over Iraq, it just had Kuwait as a trading port.  This was a lot like malaysia/Singapore, Aden (yemen) and a few places in India and Egypt - as long as you were friendly to the UK everything was fine.  Kuwaits status as an official protectorate of the UK sort of came into being in 1913 with the Anglo-Ottoman convention of that year. 

Then came WW1.  The British blockaded the place, then the allies carved up Tukey's arab possessions in ways that suited them.   Kuwait lost most of its territory to Saudi in 1920.  From 1920 -1937 the Saudi's blockaded the place, and that pretty much ended  any economic prosperity they had (Japanese farmed pearls also cut out a lot of Kuwaiti revenue).  

Then the British and Americans found oil...  and then WW2 happened.  and then some stuff in between that kept Iraq and Kuwait separate - Iraq initially claimed Kuwait, but the Arab league recognized Kuwait as separate, and so did iraq in the 60's. 

So back to 1988, well 1990 - Iraq was broke. Kuwait was rich, close, they had some claim to the region, and occupying kuwait would mean not having to pay them back.  After some discussions with the Americans it (wrongly) appeared everything was fine, so they took the place over.  And the UN and the US didn't like that, nor did  Saudi who are quite a bit more important in the world.  Also the precedent of being able to eliminate countries by force is troublesome to the  UN and other countries that might get eliminated by force.  


There is basically a settlement on the territorial integrity of Kuwait vs Iraq at this point.  There are some persistent complications related to reparations.  Basically Iraq is on the hook for 350 billion USD, which is an absurdly large number, and the current government of Iraq aren't all that  fond of having to pay for the misdeeds of Saddam Hussein, particularly when their own country is rather desperate for cash.

cptn_garlock,anime,1389039400.0,"&gt;I really thought Kaito was a good character, even though he at first seems like he doesn't care about much and appears lazy and unmotivated, he really does value and prioritise what is important to him.

Either it was too subtle or I missed cues, but Katio's character didn't seem genuine. I think the show did perhaps *too* good of a job to me of making him seem lazy and unmotivated, because I didn't feel that the moments where he was being kind and thoughtful (outside the most minimal of gestures like buying Frau some food) was really him doing that; it felt like the show was making him do it because, you know, he's the brotag. I feel like *Steins;Gate* did it better, making it more apparent that Okabe is really a caring guy despite his obviously insane persona. 

One detail I feel like the show should have made more explicit, that would've made him seem less inherently lazy and unmotivated, is what happened to him after the S.S. Anemone accident, where[](/s ""he apparently felt he couldn't become an astronaut, his lifelong dream, because of the Elephant-Mouse syndrome."") I think that would've given some background and insight on his real feelings. 

&gt;Not just because it was clear she was the female lead, I felt that you could really feel their slowly growing romance: they supported each other in their toughest times and their personalities really compliment each other.

stephanie_tanner,AskWomen,1389039486.0,"I went to Nicaragua by myself for six weeks. I was there mostly to do academic research in the capital, but also traveled to a few other cities for fun/exploration. 

If you're nervous about being alone, try to establish local contacts before you go. My first two weeks in Nicaragua I stayed in a missionary guest house which I found through a friend whose parents had missionary connections. It was nice to know I had a safe destination when I first arrived; getting the feel for a brand new country takes some time. For the remainder of my trip, I generally got by on my own, while also making connections with other researchers and tourists when I could. As a single female, it was nice to buddy up with another single lady for a beach trip - more security and more fun. Making travel friends is really easy in hostels and I met a decent number of other women who were traveling solo. 

But the local people were also really kind and helpful. Obviously I was reasonably cautious and I did experience the typical cat-calling, which was nearly a constant in the touristy cities, but for the most part, strangers were friendly and harmless. There were times when I had to ask a stranger for directions (I took the wrong bus in the city and ended up way off from my destination). I ended up spending half a day with a local older gentleman talking about history, politics, and travel. Since he was a strange man and I was alone in a foreign country, I kept my awareness pretty high, but gave him the benefit of the doubt enough to take a cab around with him to some of the city sites. There's definitely a line to walk between being cautious and also having unique, new, enjoyable experiences. Trust your gut if you get a bad feeling about a certain place or person. 

I never felt truly unsafe by myself. I found my travel guide book (I use Lonely Planet) pretty helpful in its safety/security advice, while the US State Dept info (I'm from the US) seemed to exaggerate any relevant risks (which is understandable considering the source, and it never hurts to read it so you can have an idea of what the worst case scenario might be).

Oh I agree with that, it's just a risk/reward scenario for me.  

I'd say Brady plays 2-4 more years.  So we'll call it 3 on average.  Let's also make the assumption that he plays at a high level for those 3 years.  Or we could trade him for 2 first rounders. We'll assume the 2 are packaged up to get a top 10 draft pick to take a QB, and that .  

Keep Brady = 3 good years of QB play.  

Trade Brady = The possibility of 12 good years of QB play, or the possibility of 0 good years. 

What are the odds we get a good QB with that top 10 pick?  50/50?  So on average we'd be getting 6 years of a good QB with the trade option but only 3 with the keep option.  Plus we have some significant cap savings for a few years with a young, talented roster.  I'd pull the trigger on the trade.

edit: Thinking about it comparitively, Brady is as old as Manning was when he left the Colts.  They had the opportunity to draft Andrew Luck.  It's worked out wonderfully for the Colts.  I'm not saying we'd get a once in a generation prospect like Luck, but even for a lesser player the deal would have been well worth it."

It's why Kobe Bryant can still play basketball at a high level even though he's not the athlete he was when he was younger - Now he uses angles, he's a better shooter than he used to be, and he understands when to make the right pass, or how to make guys bite on fakes more than he used to.

waitingforjune,acappella,1389039854.0,"Yeah, delivering great performances of great arrangements is key to delivering a top-tier album. Having an excellent editor and mix engineer helps, but the adage ""you can't polish a turd"" applies.

One huge thing that my group did that garnered a lot of positive feedback was arrangement editing. We took our group-arranged songs and sent them to professional arrangers (Tom Anderson, Robert Dietz, etc.), where they fixed up some things and made the arrangements much more interesting for studio recording. It's significantly less money than buying a commissioned arrangement from them directly, and the group is still a large part of the arrangement itself.

As far as improving the performance aspect, that is where having a dedicated Producer is vital. ""Producer"" is typically used as an all-encompassing term to describe mix engineer, tracking engineer, etc., but really, the Producer is the one person in charge of the creative vision of the album. They will do a lot of coaching in the studio, picking and choosing takes, and ensuring that the best possible product is made every step of the way.

DIY recording will definitely allow you to go at your own pace, but I would strongly advise to have someone (MD or someone else with the proper amount of music knowledge and dedication) to serve as the Producer for the project."

For example, we had James Cannon mix our Usher track because of his extensive background in working with hip-hop and Tat Tong mixed ""Party Rock Anthem"" because he is a mainstream pop producer as well. The best way to find out what is out there is to get out there in the community (CASA offers a ton of resources, including a great Facebook group full of awesome discussion), see which producers are getting attention, and check out their portfolio. Most producers will have some sort of sample reel or Soundcloud where you can check out their recent work. Another great way to learn more about producers is to check out your favorite a cappella tracks, or tracks that sound like songs you want to record, and find out who mixed them.

If you want to PM me with more specific questions re: a cappella producers, I'd be happy to point you in any direction that you'd like with detailed recommendations as far as genres of specialty. Again, I would be remiss not to also recommend myself as a mix engineer as well :-)."

When you think of 20 degrees in your head, you're actually thinking of what it feels like to have a 50 degree boundary layer.  

When the wind blows it blows this warmer layer away more quickly and leaves cold, bulk air.  So now the temperature next to your skin is 20 and it feels much colder!  That boundary layer is actually 20 degrees now.  

And interesting point to note is the the wind chill can't cool things past the actual temperature.  If it's 35 with a wind chill of 15, a glass of water outside won't freeze.  It'll stay 35 degrees. "

CrazyPlato,AskMen,1389040639.0,"Let me try to describe it:

High school dating is pretty limited. You have a small body of girls to meet (unlikely that you'll date someone from another school), and you have to deal with your parents' influence on your decisions. Even if you don't care what they think of your date, even if you have your own car to go out, you know that your parents will know when you leave and when you get home. It's like fishing in a private pond: You can catch a winner, but you'll be looking over your shoulder in case you do something you aren't supposed to.

College is more free: you have your own living space, your own transportation, and you're older, which means more date options. However, the limited pool is still there: you're probably going to date students from your school, you still have to work around class, etc. It's like fishing in that small pond, but without all the restrictions.

Adult life is fishing in the ocean. You get all the freedom, you can do whatever with whoever. But it's a lot harder to meet people: that limited focus in school made it easier to approach people, and without it it's harder to find a common ground to break the ice on. You can certainly find women, but it might be in an unlikely place, and you'll have to manage it between work schedules and stuff."

Most of the time we just spent less on each other than we might've if I'd been dating someone in my own tax bracket. You both need to be willing to talk about your feelings surrounding money, which was uncomfortable for me at first but ended up being a good choice down the road.

I think most people would agree, though, that it's never acceptable for partners to use money (or lack of money) against each other. Interpersonal relationships are not considered fodder for monetary exchange in modern western culture, and it's unacceptable for money to become a factor in anything but the specifically monetary aspects of a relationship (such as who pays for what)."

The whole UN budget is ~2.8 billion a year (http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCABRE9BQ0JX20131227), relocating would not be hugely expensive.

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389042019.0,"Well there's also the concept of emergent storylines that come from your interaction with the game, either from interacting with other players (from MMOs and MOBAs to something like Journey or Dark Souls) or from interacting with the game system (something like X-Com where the permadeath mechanics creates mini stories, or games with randomly generated worlds). 

The problem is that in this situation the creator usually has to relinquish a lot if not all control over the storyline and (whether the fans of emergent storytelling like it or not) it does limit the amount of stories you can tell with it (or rather: it becomes like monkeys with typos situation, where most of the time the ""stories"" that will be created will be rather mundane). 

Right now accounting for a lot variety is complicated because you have to prepare assets for any situation. But the holy grail on the long run would be to design systems that can react somewhat organically to a lot of actions. 

Think of the difference between a system where every NPC is hand placed and routed in place vs. a system where NPCs have an interal schedule. Maybe one day NPCs will be their own eco system that generate quests. (like there's a town and an NPC has a random chance to steal something and he steals from the first NPC they find and that NPC then gives you a quest; or a town can randomly start lacking a resource (because of bad harvests) and hence attack a different town etc) 

Right now, especially with things like cinematography or voice acting, even all that would be extremely inferior to anything hand crafted. But there are a lot of games that can be compelling even with more minimal art style (like lack of voice acting) it could be interesting to see what could be done as agent systems become more sophisticated. "
HandshakeOfCO,relationships,1389042020.0,"Wow, your post really resonated with me.  I'm similar in personality - kind of a loner, with no real close friends and a family who will never see eye to eye with me - and I had a relationship end on me in much the same way as yours.  Here's some thoughts from someone a little farther out than you (about 18 months on).

First, go see a therapist.  I cannot overstate how ridiculous I thought this would be before I went, nor can I overstate just how amazingly helpful it actually was, looking back.  If you feel self-conscious talking with one, try another.  You NEED someone you can talk to about this stuff.  Other people have friends, but for us loners, therapists are amazing at filling that gap.

Also - no contact.  No contact will start to give you closure, which is IMO what you need, and what I don't think you have yet, given his (cowardly!) actions.  FWIW, a life of ""no restrictions"" doesn't exist, at least for mature adults, and I certainly wouldn't want to devote my love to someone who viewed me as a ""restriction.""

Nobody knows the future, and so yes, in reality, maybe there's a chance that things will turn out the way you want them.  But you absolutely cannot wait around thinking he'll grow up or come back or whatever.  And it's very hurtful and disrespectful of him to continue to be in touch with you.  And it's not doing him any favors, either.  So... you have to be the bigger person and go 100% no contact, for both your sakes.  At least for now.

I totally understand why you'd accept his idea to stay in touch.  I did the same thing.  But you gotta think of that as like, shooting heroin to dull the pain.  IT WILL NOT GET YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.  At best it'll prevent you from healing and at worse it will be like death by one thousand tiny cuts.  The best thing you can do right now is rip that bandaid off quick and get to a pretend reality where he, like, died in a car wreck or something.  Permanent no contact.

Getting there, for me, was the hardest thing I've ever done.  Mine didn't die in a car wreck - she was still ""out there,"" so I felt like I was purposely letting a door slowly close that I absolutely did not want closed, and from the second I woke up I had, in the corner of my mind's eye, a vision of that door slowly closing, and me doing nothing to stop it.  At night it was the absolute worst, I couldn't fall asleep, and when I finally did, I'd wake right back up because of nightmares about it.  Every waking thought was basically, ""I wonder what she's doing,"" or ""this is a test she's running on me, and I'm totally fucking it up by not talking to her.""

I couldn't get to ""real"" no contact right away.  Maybe some people can, but I had to play tricks on myself.  Like, I created an email address for ""fake her"" and changed her contact so that when I found a link that I knew she'd like, I could send it and it'd feel like she actually got it.  I had conversations with her in my head.  I moved, since coming home was making me feel crushingly alone and empty - the exact opposite of how it SHOULD feel to come home.  Doing anything and everything, in my mind, was totally legit and fair game and without self-judgment EXCEPT for ACTUALLY contacting her.  That's where I had to start.  

Anything in the past that made me happy, even in the slightest, got dug up and recruited.  I played a TON of old games, watched a ton of movies (going to a movie by yourself is amazing, btw), and ate of all the delicious foods.  Happiness was now a commodity scarcer than cash, so it was mined and held onto, at any cost.  Any time I felt bad, I would write.  Mostly letters to her, sometimes songs or stories, sometimes just mindless self-pitying drivel, just to get it out of my system.  When I, like you, got anxiety attacks and couldn't breathe, I'd walk around, or run, or jump rope.

I believe life is about growing as a person.  So the silver lining is that what happened was a way for me to grow.  I didn't ask for it but by god, there's really only two ways to react, and I'm choosing the way that'll make me a better person, not a worse one.  One day I'll have climbed out of this hole, and I'll be stronger, and stronger in a way that I couldn't have become from ANY other experience.  

I haven't sent a link to the fake email in like, 6 months now.  The nightmares still come but it's easier to shrug them off.  And there are moments of happy, too, and they feel AMAZING.  And I feel like I have a much better understanding and ability to empathize with people, and I'm excited for what that might bring me in the future.

So, yeah.  You're going to be OK, too.  It takes time - that's what everybody tells you - but they don't include the most important bit:  it takes time IN THE RIGHT MINDSET.  Time and a hopeful ""this is temporary, we can work it out"" mindset is going to push you farther down and do nothing good.  But any amount of time - even if it's only a few minutes a day at first - that you spend in a true, honest mindset of trying to make yourself happy - that'll actually heal you.  "

gingerkid1234,AskHistorians,1389042189.0,"&gt;Possibly the most interesting thing about the Tacoma Narrows Bridge is that the exact reasons it fell are still being studied. I'm not an engineer and my understanding of physics is maybe rudimentary, so I'm not really going to try and explain what's known to have factored in.

I am an engineer(ing student)!  A common explanation for it is that it's an example of resonance, where something vibrates at high amplitude because a force acts on it at the resonant frequency, so that it augments the vibrating thing's free response.  While resonance is pretty cool and can be used to displace things to a great extent, it's not what happened on the bridge.  Examples of resonance are [wine glasses breaking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE827gwnnk4).  There's even an [example with a footbridge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWoiMMLIvco).  Or even a real-life example with the [Millenium bridge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiaM_LZUsqM), wherein pedestrians unconcious step-matching caused a horizontal vibration.  People swaying to stay on their feet than made it worse.  Interesting engineering problem there.

However, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge doesn't fit the bill.  The whole point of resonance is that you have a force that matches with the vibration, and wind generally doesn't alternate at a particular frequency.  While it's possible that a constant wind would cause oscillating vortexes, [wikipedia describes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_%281940%29#Resonance_.28due_to_Von_K.C3.A1rm.C3.A1n_vortex_street.29_hypothesis) why that doesn't make sense.  Also it had vibration issues at many frequencies, though the storm when it collapsed had a previously unseen in that bridge vibration mode.

So it's an aeroelastic phenomenon like [flutter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity#Flutter).  Essentially, the aerodynamic properties of it were such that the wind caused a feedback loop, similar to resonance, but with a different cause.

~~My pet theory is that it was torsional divergence that caused the collapse.~~ A related phenomenon I know more about is torsional divergence.  Torsional divergence was important in early aircraft design, because it was poorly understood.  There, lift causes wings to bend upwards, but also twist.  That twisting increases the angle of attack, increasing the lift force, which increases bending and twisting more.  Early aircraft designers designed wings to withstand bending, but not the twisting effects it causes, and not the greater lift caused by that twisting.

If I understand it correctly, flutter is the dynamic version of that.  That's where the horizontal vibration would've caused twisting, which then exposes the larger underside of the bridge to the wind, increasing the load on it, which increases the twisting, making the amplitude of the vibration greater.

I had a class which had a final torsional divergence wing design project, which is why I know stuff about it.  Aeroelasticity presents really interesting engineering problems, and not fully thinking out the consequences of every choice can have disastrous consequences.  Which is why the bridge fell down, and why early aircraft sometimes had their wings fall off from divergence.

edit: reading more things, it seems torsional divergence is the name of the static phenomenon, whereas flutter is the dynamic phenomenon--the former produces a displacement, but the latter causes vibration.  So I think I essentially described flutter in more words.  And flutter is the dominant theory for the collapse.  I've edited the post accordingly.

**tl;dr** it collapsed due to flutter, an aeroelastic phenomenon that causes a feedback loop of vibration

edit2: /u/fetidfeet's comment below talks about why the bridge was insufficiently strong enough to withstand these forces, which is the other piece of the puzzle."

Mr_Diggums,AskMen,1389042365.0,"First and foremost, no BS. There is nothing more annoying than dating or setting up a date with a girl, and things seem headed in the right direction, when all of a sudden she ends things with a lame excuse. I don't care if I ""seem really awesome"" or the ""sex was really good"" or ""it was really really nice meeting you"". Spare me. It's all for naught if I'm getting rejected. If you're not looking to date, and he asked you out, make it known RIGHT AWAY that you're not looking to date. I smack my head so hard when a girl agrees to a date, and seems quite excited, only to end things because they ""aren't looking to date""...why the FUCK did you agree to a date then? Having an active OKC profile only magnifies this frustration. Hell, it's happened to me before the very first date. If you go out on a date and you're just not feeling a connection, say so...our egos can handle it. It beats second guessing where WE went wrong.

Second, the whole friend thing is very difficult. If you knew them in advance, then it is possible, and you can remain friends. However, if you don't know this person, they ask you out, and you reject them, they aren't going to be friends with you. I'm sure there are many awesome girls out there I could be friends with, but if I muster up the effort/courage to approach you and ask you out, I'm interested in dating you, not finding a new friend. Why should I spend time and effort becoming your friend when I could focus on a girl who wants to date me?

Long story short, be honest. When I get rejected, I would much rather know why so I can improve myself. Did I try too hard or not enough? What were my mistakes? Hell, sometimes there just isn't a connection. If they get very defensive (irrationally so), then you probably dodged a bullet. Just be upfront and don't waste time...every day that passes is another day of guys thinking about you and building you up. Reject fast, reject honestly, and be forward...it'll make us respect you a lot more."

itsjusttoored,pettyrevenge,1389043010.0,"Hey, are you pro-life? Do you also support education, benefits, healthcare, all the like for when the kid is actually born? What about comprehensive sex education? It's fairly obvious abstinence-only doesn't do that well, and that'd stop a whole load of potential abortions from teenagers! Probably not. The moment that kid comes out of the mother you probably couldn't give a flying fuck about it, and until you support everything to protect the kid before and after birth, you're a hypocrite.

Say you do support all that. How about if the women in there need an abortion because they'll die without it, along with the kid? What if the kid has been diagnosed with some sort of disease that'll make his/her life barely worth living, that'll leave the kid in pain every waking moment of life? What if the mother was raped? What if she can't afford to look after the kid, and give it even the bare necessities to live?

People like you seem to think people *like* getting abortions, that maybe it's *fun,* maybe it's a day out for the mother-to-not-be and all her friends. Maybe if abortions are illegal, everything will magically get better.

Nah, people would turn to shoving coat hangers inside themselves to get rid of the kid, and bleed out in back alleys. There was a thread I saw earlier where a classmate of OP's grandfather was found dead after attempting an abortion herself, in her own bedroom, when abortions were illegal.

**Major road**

1: You cross a whole army of bandits. A whole army.

2: You are ambushed by bandits.

3: You are ambushed by goblins/kobolds.

4: A hungry dragon flies above.

5: The road suddenly turns sharply, going in a direction different from the map.

6: You pass a group of proud dragonborn knights. One of them takes a passing glance as a slight 
against his honour, provoking a fight to the death.

7: A caravan passes by, offering trade (basic goods).

8: A group of guards accosting an ornate carriage pass by. This is a magic item dealer

9: Renowned blacksmith (masterwork armour and weapons)

10: Noble (Offers quests and a nice meal)

11: Angry noble (Orders guards to attack)

12: A group of goblins is at the side of the road. Upon closer inspection, you see they are peaceful 
and solemn, burying a respected elder.

13: Thirteen dwarves, a halfling and a human wizard in grey robes pass you. They are heard 
speaking of a great red dragon and a lost mountain keep.

14: At night, wolves circle your camp. They can be heard howling, but do not attack. Upon 
inspection, nothing is there but a cold chill and a wisp of mist here and there.

15: Minstrels pass you by. If you pay them for a song, they begin to follow you.

16: You pass through a small village. The locals are thrilled by your tales of adventure and 
exploration.

17: Men in black robes (hooded) pass you by. Upon inspection, these are *d4* :

* Monks from a distant monastery

* Cultists, spreading the word of Orcus

* Famous nobles, trying to travel unseen

* Happy, normal travellers who just happen to really like black, hooded robes.

18: You find a trail of gold pieces leading off the road into the bushes. Upon closer inspection, this is 
an ambush

19: A chest full of troll dung

20: A chest full of unimaginable riches

**Smaller, more isolated road** (Replace certain events with these:)

1: A large sinkhole appears before you and swallows you whole. When you awaken, you find 
yourselves in a troll's lair. The troll and his associates are unhappy.

6: A skeleton is splayed out across the road. In his hand is an ""elixir of eternal life"", uncapped, half-
empty. Although the skeleton is picked clean and looks long-dead, evidence suggests he has only 
been there for about a week.

8: A man on a horse trots past. He is a local knight

9: Squire

10: Bounty hunter after some ne'er-do-well bandits.

11: Bounty hunter after you.

15: A woman rushes out of the bushes, completely naked. She rushes towards you, begging for you 
to protect her. A few moments later, a bear emerges from the woods, and quickly polmorphs into a 
hairy young man, who says ""I'm so sorry Gwen, I should have told you. The spell is still a little 
fickle!""

**Lonely path/empty trail**

1: The path stops completely. Before you is a great chasm, and even across it there is no trail.

2: A thin, drooping rope bridge crosses a chasm or gorge.

6: There is a great bear sleeping in the middle of the path, larger than anything you have ever seen, 
and fat as a lazy king. Only upon rolling a 1 on a check will it awaken, but anything below a hard DC 
will cause it to stir, appearing to have awoken, before falling asleep again.

8: A pack of small peaceful creatures (location specific) gather around you. They follow you and sing 
peaceful songs

9: They speak common, and regale you with their great adventures, in the remote woodland creature 
cities of Redwall.

10: They pause before running away.

11: They transform into large, mutant, carnivorous versions of their former selves and try to eat you.

15: A group of adventurers that look identical to you, but defeated, bloodied, barely holding together 
and clearly much higher level run past you in the opposite direction. If you offer them aid, they 
promise to return the favour someday. Upon continuing along your trail, you find what they were 
running from *d4*:

* An adorable squirrel

* Another group of adventurers identical to yourselves, but transformed into horrible, evil 
aberrations.

* A group of fifteen adult trolls. Mating. Aggressively.

* A group of beautiful maidens, fair and fragile, speaking of these aforementioned adventurers as ""pansies"". They challenge you to arm wrestling. A 20 is required to win. Upon winning, they draw weapons and challenge you to combat. They are 3 levels above you, and yield upon reaching &lt;10hp.

These happen once for every day of travel."

I also thought that foreigners were not entitled to free healthcare apart from emergency treatment, so I never considered going to a public hospital for a non-emergency prescription, as I assumed it would still be expensive, but with more waiting around!

I can bring maybe 1 or 2 months supply with me, but I can't order any more than that from my doctors here, so after a couple of months I will need more medication. 

So basically, probably the easiest option is to walk into a clinic (is that an option, or do I have to register officially first and book an appointment?) and then tell them about my asthma and then pay for the medicine?

I didn't do anything up until a year ago when I started working out and I was still having random back spasms about once a month. I took it really easy and used [this thing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx0jZBEmZcE), she does a really good job of explaining how to use it at different levels of difficulty. I noticed I wouldn't be able to do too much before pain started creeping in and I had to stop immediately after that rep. 

Over the next 3 months of doing very light exercise, my lower back muscles became stronger which took a lot of stress off my lower spinal column. Anyways, I eventually moved on to very light deadlifts and increased weight as I got more and more comfortable. 

I haven't had a back spasm in almost a year now since I started working out. It was the best thing I could've done for my back. I'm even at the point where I can deadlift 200lbs for 8 reps. I know it's not a crazy amount for some people, but after a back injury that put me in the ER, I feel incredible."

But when that happens, I feel guilty and sad, I don't laugh about it and see it as a game.  So I was sympathetic a bit to your gf until you mentioned that.  That's some sociopathic shit right there."

Because getting to the top of the reddit.com front page gives small, unknown standup comics orders of magnitude more exposure than getting to the top of /r/all. They don't care about people who comment in /r/funny or what else gets submitted there. They simply want to be able to have their standup shot viewed by the huge mass of people who just view the default front page. Getting that level of exposure can have a very real effect on a comic's following which directly affects how much money they make. That's why they care."

Stray observations:

1) When men are merged with animals, they have animal heads. When women are merged with animals, their faces still look mostly human.

2) Most of the women discreetly dressed in their major portrait and whom I have NOT classified as scantily-clad have at least one cheesecake picture included in their profile.

3) All of the non-sexy females are either gnome-like/childish in appearance or are literally children.

Reassure her that you aren't passing judgment on her and that you're there to support her, but ultimately if she's not comfortable with it, nothing you say is going to change that.

Chaos_Spear,sailing,1389044087.0,"Well, depends a little bit on what you're looking for, how old you are, and how much you want to spend.

If you have a large amount of disposable income, then *Europa* takes paying passengers all the time, just go onto http://www.barkeuropa.com/ and book a passage.  There are others, but that's the one everyone knows about.

If you have a medium amount of disposable income, then there are shorter passages on all kinds of ships.  *Maple Leaf* in BC springs to mind, but depending on the time of year, *Roseway*, *Lynx*, and *Pride of Baltimore II* all take on paying crew, as well as many more.  General bet is that if a ship is undertaking a passage, then they probably have a spot or two open for people who can pay.

If you have very little disposable income, but a fair amount of time, then you might look into becoming a volunteer for a Tall Ship organization near you.  Most programs are willing to take on volunteers for maintenance or education.  If you're under 18, then you may be able to apply for an internship through a sail training program.  If you're in college, you can spend a semester at sea through SEA.

Tall Ships is a world unto itself: it may seem, from the outside, that getting into it is impossible, but as soon as you make the smallest connection, Tall Ship sailors will give you all sorts of advice as to which ships would fit what you're looking for.

[www.sailtraininginternational.org](http://www.sailtraininginternational.org) is a good place for anyone looking for volunteer opportunities or paid passages in Europe.  The United States equivalent, [Tall Ships America](http://www.tallshipsamerica.com) isn't as useful, but might give you some ideas nonetheless.

**TL;DR: Just contact ships, however you can, and expect to spend either time or money before getting to do any ocean voyages!**"

The fat noble laughs, unwillingly flinging specks of half-chewed bread into your faces. The tavernkeeper smirks as he slowly wiped down the bar. A drunk calls to him, and he raises a finger, urging you to wait. He pours an ale for the man, before sauntering back slowly, starting to wipe again. ""So,"" he utters, clear amongst the din of tavern noise, ""who did you say you were looking for?""

Go on youtube and watch storytellers. A good storyteller can make the dullest storyline into an edge-of-your-seat adventure.

Lastly, group initiative. Only make the players roll, and alternate between players and monsters, rolling for similar monsters. *(Example: your six players roll a 16, a 14, a 9, a 6, a 3 and a 1. Your three goblins attack together with an initiative of 8. Your three bugbears attack together with an initiative of 11. This means you go player-player-three bugbears-player-three goblins-player-player-player.)* I also treat surprise rounds as the players attacking first, going around the table in a predetermined order. Also, you could have the players roll initiative at the beginning of the session, and retain it the whole time, with monsters taking a -5 penalty on surprise rounds.

It's pretty interesting to see the internal logic the game works on sometimes. Like high trade actually gives you tons of advantages for your military and I never realized that before recently. Or how you do in the various public events actually affects the risk of rebellion. 

Basically, there are a lot of interesting nooks and crannies in this game (especially with this web about who tries to assassinate you for what reason). If I compare that to game dev tycoon... that game was dead to me once I realized that it really works only off one secret formula namely that to get good reviews your game has to have more points than your last game, aka the scoring system actually encourages you to make games that are worse than what you could do as your dominant strategy while giving next to no bonus to any kind of logical connection (like not punishing you for making a fighting game with a steering wheel controller), respectively any logic rules are minimal (like RPG is always popular etc).  

I like that this game actually feels like it it treats several appraoches as valid rather than it just being lip service (military, magic and people skills). And to me personally it didn't feel like just doing choices, you actually have to set up some sort of basic strategy you have to follow. "

So, here's why you're only supposed to take as little pain meds as you can.  Ibuprofen is spectacular at alleviating subcutaneous, and particularly dental, pain.  However, it's a complex compound that your liver needs to clean out of your bloodstream, and doesn't have a very easy time doing.  Hence, if you take too much ibuprofen for too long, you can get liver damage.

If you're a bigger person, however, you need more ibuprofen in your bloodstream for it to affect all the pain receptors it needs to affect (remember, an increase in size increases your total mass along the square-cube rule, which means in laypersons' terms that you get heavier more and more rapidly as you get bigger).  More, your liver is going to be larger (proportionally, your liver could be almost 20% larger than a small woman's, if you're quite tall), which means that the labor of cleaning the ibuprofen is going to be spread more evenly over a larger body of cells.

So, let's get down to brass tacks.  A standard dose of ibuprofen is two 200mg pills, and is targeted at a person who weighs, on average, about 140 lbs.  This weight is chosen because it's a midpoint between average male and female weights, but it's biased a little toward the ladies' side because ibuprofen is so good at relieving menstrual cramps (women use more ibuprofen than men).  If you're a little 5'0"" woman who weighs 105 lbs, taking that standard dose can, over the long run, do some really nasty damage to your liver; you should only take one pill or maybe a pill and a half (that's why the long ones have that little divot in the middle--to make cutting them easier) as a standard dose, and two for intermittent, serious pain.  If you're a strapping lass of 6'0"", though, you're probably 175 lbs or more, and a standard dose won't be very effective.  You'll need a third pill for reasonable effectiveness levels, and might even take a fourth for serious pain.  Your liver, being much larger than your short friend's, is able to handle the additional stress such a high dose puts on it, so you really shouldn't have anything to worry about.

And, just as a side note, never take ibuprofen on an empty stomach, and especially not larger doses.  It can damage the lining of your stomach as it dissolves in your stomach acid.  Even a little half-slice of bread is generally enough to protect you, though."

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389044962.0,"&gt;How do you know the US missile defense system is useless?

Because it's a laughing stock of the serious technical community.  

The only serious deterrent to a missile attack is a retaliatory missile attack.  Which the US is certainly capable of.  But that doesn't do you a  whole lot of good if everyone is dead.  Oh and the British have remote controlled stealth bombers, and French missiles have had a fairly good (or bad depending on your perspective) against anything they've been fired  at.  

The US has *maybe* 3 dozen missiles to try and do missile defence, spread out but mostly aimed at North Korea and Iran, and they all suck, but they're also trivial to overwhelm for any competent adversary since 30 interceptors cannot shoot down any more than 30 missiles.  They've only ever worked in synthetic tests against incompetent US targets and even then barely half the time (http://defensetech.org/2013/07/18/test-failure-stirs-missile-defense-doubts/). 

That isn't to say research is a waste of money - it isn't.  The only way you learn to solve these problems is to test, try again, test some more, and keep going until you get it right.  But right now the US suggesting it as any sort of reliable missile defence capability is as credible as the NSA claiming it's not spying on people.  "

So without even realizing it you waltzed in and basically stepped on our toes, and all so you can spread your business and make a profit. Well I hate to say it but most of us really hate vendors who just name drop themselves, and who expect us to come and visit just because you came by. Sorry.

Holding it in made me make passive aggressive comments towards him that I knew were bothering him. Once I realized this, I apologized for making him feel bad and I just flat out asked him what the plans were. We've talked marriage many times before but at that point we were together for 9 years, had a house, settled into our careers, etc. and marriage was just the next logical step. I felt a bazillion times better after we had the discussion so my advice is to just sit down and have a discussion about what the future plans are. I reiterated several times that I am not trying to pressure him in to proposing tomorrow, I just want to make sure we're on the same page and are expecting the same things out of our life together.  After our chat I was able to stop thinking about it so damn much and since I knew it was coming eventually, I had more of an 'it happens when it happens' philosophy *(and it did happen a few months after the talk!)*.

duckduck_goose,AskWomen,1389045565.0,"For me pursuing a guy socially has been punished with the following stereotypes:

* She's desperate - run!

* Clock is ticking, wants to get married, both? - RUN!

* Probably crazy - run!

* No one wants her &amp;/or damaged goods - run!

I've seen women kind of pursue men and then heard the way men have discussed her when she's not been around (men who are socially kind of jerks, immature or otherwise not that into her) so it has been drilled into my head to just send out subtle cues to male suitors.

Online dating made it easier to make some first moves without *seeming too desperate* (in my mind though I started even getting nervous it came out that way on the other side so I stopped after a while too) but basically it took having it click in my head that I ended up dating a lot of jerks I wasn't all that into simply because they pursued me first.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389045576.0,"&gt;To the best of my knowledge the only military alliance NZ has in place is with Australia through ANZUS.

New Zealand is in a Personal Union  with the 15 countries that share the same Queen, and New Zealand remains allied with the UK broadly under that framework.  UN recognition of a state is also essentially a guarantee of independence for that state from any other state attempting to annex it.  

&gt; I would still argue that they would choose not to honor such an agreement.

Failing to honour such agreement, aside from being unBritish would be a tremendously bad international precedent.  They got into WW1 because of a 100 year old guarantee of independence to Belgium after all. 

&gt;States are rational actors, and engaging a superpower militarily is pretty far from rational.

Allowing a country like the United States (or China or Russia or Britain or France) to rampage around the world unchallenged would be far less rational.  Appeasement and all that.  

Also, given the successes of the Iraqi's and Afghans (and Vietnamese), the US isn't nearly as threatening as it makes itself out to be.

And while Bungie did create the Halo series, the original Halo game was supposed to be a strategy game for Apple Macs. However, Microsoft needed games and game developers for their upcoming Xbox console, and bought Bungie in 2000. The Halo game was then changed to a FPS, and was released as launch title for the Xbox as *Halo: Combat Evolved*.

In 2007, Bungie became an independent game developer again, Bungie LLC. The deal to split from Microsoft involved to important conditions: 1) Bungie make one more Halo game (Halo: Reach), and 2) all rights to the Halo franchise are transferred to Microsoft.

The military industrial complex doesn't want wars, it wants arms races and pirates.   

The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have contracted US trade, limited their ability to sell weapons, and led to significant capital outflows out of the US because the US  is a net importer, and trade costs go up in an unstable world.  None of that is desirable, not even for US military suppliers who would love to be selling  aircraft and tanks to Pakistan and India and etc. but aren't.  

&gt;We're opening up oil lines 

Not in Iraq.  Iraq oil contracts largely exclude US firms, and the Iraqi's are selling to Asia, not the US.  


&gt;It's not a conspiracy theory at all.

It is.  It's a fantasy land of wanting to believe the US has some evil master  plan pulling the strings.  The truth is much much much more mundane.

Even if it's expired, you can still get the card.  I think if someone refers you, you both get $50 (I can refer you if you're interested) but that can't be combined with the $150 offer.

In terms of searching, [NerdWallet](http://www.nerdwallet.com/rewards-credit-cards) has a large list that you can filter and search through.  Credit Karma and (and maybe CreditSesame?) will recommend cards as well as tell you your likelihood of being accepted.

If you are denied for a beginner card or two, look into secured credit cards - they're ""secured"" by a deposit you make, and they allow you to build credit history.

Edit: Don't get one with an annual fee unless you know it'll be worth it.

Pay the entire balance when the statement comes, by the payment due date.  Don't spend money (interest) to increase your credit score.  

The only time utilization (balance of all credit cards/total credit limit across all cards) matters is when you plan on applying for credit in the next month or two, and even then, it's a small amount.  If you plan on applying for credit in a month or two, pay all but 5-10% of your credit limit by the statement close date (end of that billing period).  It's a good idea to pay it a few days before, since payments can take a few days to process."

I always use the argument about how her style of writing grew with her characters, and how I grew up alongside them. She writes so many inspiring characters.

&gt; if libertarians arent just ultra conservative republicans

They aren't, they're ultra republicans, sure, but they're also liberal - not conservative. They're socially liberal, they're for birth control, gay marriage, legalization of weed, etc.  But they're also for lower taxes, smaller government, etc.  

&gt; why did ron paul run as a republican for 30 years

He didn't.

&gt; why is rand paul listed as a republican

Because he is republican.

&gt; how come not one of them is for campaign finance reform/limiting corporate money in politics?

Take out the corporation, the other falls with it.  Anyway, every politician takes money for their campaign.  You can say you're against something, but actions speak louder than words.

&gt; if libertarianism is so awesome, show me a successful, thriving libertarian society anywhere, at any time now or in history

There's always potential for error when something new comes up.  If we never took chances, women still wouldn't have any rights and slavery would still be prevalent, so many things wouldn't exist.  I mean who the hell would've imagined something like a phone could exist?  It wouldn't, if people listened to everyone saying ""It never happened before so lets be honest, you can't do it."" Nonetheless, there *are* examples in history where libertarian views existed and thrived, but google can show you that one."

The Ninja for that sportbike look, the Dual Sports if you want a commuting weapon and want to take on offroad at will, and the Rebel if you want to relax through the city streets. Any of these bikes can be had for ~$2000 used (they are going to be older, but that's ok) and can be sold for about the same price you bought it for provided you keep it clean. They are also super simple to work on. Single cylinders, single carb, straightforward setup, abundance of parts (well... parts for some of the Dual Sport bikes can be rare.).

The point here is that this isn't your ""forever"" bike. This is something that you will learn the basics on and get comfortable with riding with. Ride it for 6-months to a year and use the money you sell it for as seed money for a more ""dream"" bike. "

I have no regrets about the wedding we did have, but it didn't matter. What matters is that you have the right person.

If you ever change your mind? Do a vow renewal in 5 or 10 years and have the wedding you never got to have.

And while you're at it, restructure things to reduce how much the government needs to know.  The FairTax does that.  Having the government blind to income is a huge feature for me.  Stop trying to figure out if company A made more money in the US or in Ireland, because it's much much easier to say for certain where people are SPENDING money.

UglierThanMoe,movies,1389047982.0,"I'm not really a Max Payne fan. I've played the first game and I liked it, but not enough to turn me into a fan of the franchise. Still, the movie did the game(s) absolutely no credit at all. It's not the worst film based on a video game (that ""honor"" is shared between the Streetfighter movie with J.C. van Damme and the Super Mario movie with Bob Hoskins), but it was still really, really bad, sadly."
LolaRuns,Games,1389047985.0,"So your life is not complete unless video games mature and video games can't be mature unless they do rape? That doesn't sound too logical. 

Video games deal with the structures of their medium. There is still millions of things that are barely ever treated in games because they are hard to gamify or hard to believably press into the ""goal =&gt; achieve goal"" structure. 

I would consider video games mature once they have figured out that problem, how to gamify or at least consolidate with a game structure a variety of things that are normal and revelant in normal life. Just slapping some tits and rape on something doesn't make it mature any more than Mortal Kombat fatalities make games mature (they don't make the genre worse either, it's just a neutral part/aspect). 

I fully believe that games can treat a variety of different subject matters, include rape =&gt; again, I have no mouth and I must scream for a game that deals with mature themes. I just think that blindly pushing for higher ratings has very little to do with maturity (again in a medium that still hasn't figured out how to properly gamify a lot of things). I don't object to higher ratings, but just slapping a higher rating on something doesn't magically make it more mature and neither Mass Effect nor MGSV so far give me the vibe that they truly had aspirations for stories that would naturally be told in AO/would only be told right in AO. 

Last time I checked movies didn't feel the need to mandatorily show graphic rape scenes to make a good ""war is hell"" movie even though they totally could. Sure some do, but the point is that not all do it. Not because of evil oppression but because it just isn't a natural fit for every story. It's a narrative tool like anything else, but a a very fine one, not a hammer you use to bludgeon down everything. So no, I don't really see it as a crime against nature when a game goes for a rating that isn't AO. "

At least that is how it works here for all other forms of insurance.  I was just concerned that you might get in shit for advising people to break the law.

Would have been better if the US moved to a healthcare system like Canada, UK, or France.  To a Universal Healthcare model...would be cheaper for everyone.

skippydudeah,electricians,1389048655.0,"Keep the lights and plugs separate, that way when you get a big receptacle load, the lights don't dim.  When you say ""All the lights are on one breaker,"" how many lights are we talking about, and what is the size of the breaker?

There's probably nothing at all wrong with the connections, although you might have trouble finding a ground in there for receptacles.  And we aren't really allowed to use solder for connections like that anymore.  And yep, that's how they did it back in the day, alcohol torch, solder, and friction tape.  Wirenuts were a big improvement in speed.  

Depending on how you want to do it, start by bringing a circuit to the first switch, bringing a feed out of that switch (for the next switch), and a switch leg out to the light (or lights) in the room.  Nowadays it is good practice (not necessary in old work, like what you are about to get into) to make sure you have a complete feed in the switch box, in case at some point in the future, you want to add something that requires 120V to control lighting (like an occupancy sensor).  Try to not put any splices that have to be worked on in the attic itself: in a switch box, ok, in a ceiling box, ok, but not as nice.  That way if there are any problems, you know they are in the living space and not in the attic where there is blown in insulation :)

And as to

That's the good stuff :)

Women who are strongly dissuaded from pursuing have to choose from those who are interested in them, rather than getting to put in their say. If they're not interested in the men who are interested in them, they have limited power to do much about it. 

They also have to deal with being pursued by boorish and/or predatory men - who then expect the women to take their pursuit as a compliment simply for the fact of its existing.

I think these men just generally have to get over the idea that women who are pursued sit around all day fielding perfectly polite requests from subservient men, and that they enjoy rejecting those men. When dating goes wrong, it's unlikely anybody's having a good time."

On one hand, they don't live there anymore, they are here, and this is how Calgary does it.. learn to accept it.

On the other, maybe pushing for change is good.

I have a little car from 2008 with winter tires and it's not that bad. I think my suspension will need to be replaced sooner because of all the huge holes in the snow on my street though.

This being my first winter here, at first I thought it was ridiculous they didn't do all the streets like they do in Montreal. But I'm ok with it now, I'm used to my street being 2 feet of packed snow, no big deal honestly.

Not as bad as the potholes in Quebec. Actually, that's a good analogy. The potholes in Montreal are out of control, as are most of the roads. I'm sure someone from Calgary where the roads are beautiful would be all ""wtf city of montreal, fix the fucking potholes"".

But the locals just drive around them.. that's all.

benk4,nfl,1389049496.0,"Oh yeah I agree.  It's interesting how they're still stereotyped by the public, even if coaches have mostly gotten past that.  Andrew Luck basically had the same measurables as Cam Newton, yet he's viewed mostly as a pocket passer and Cam as a runner.  I can't imagine why...

&gt; Geno Smith isn't an athletic/running QB, but he's portrayed as one, even by his coaching staff.

I would call Geno Smith athletic, but not a running quarterback.  Similar to Aaron Rodgers in style.  He's definitely more of a pocket passer and prefers to throw the ball, but if you push him out of the pocket he's got wheels.  

I'd put QBs in 3 categories: running, athletic, pocket.  Pocket is like Tom Brady or Peyton Manning where it's laughable when they run.  Athletic is like Rodgers or Geno Smith where they play like a pocket passer, but when they have to run they do a good job of it.  Running is like RGIII where he's a stud runner and makes tons of plays with his legs.  

Black QBs used to be almost exclusively running QBs, now there's a good mix of running and athletic guys.  Still short on the pure pocket passers though, Leftwich is the only one that comes to mind."

statusrobot,AskWomen,1389049590.0,"I've been told several times by different men that *they* will ask women out if they're interested in them, and that not being asked out should be the only sign a woman needs in order to know that a guy isn't into her. There's at least one [popular book](http://www.amazon.com/Hes-Just-That-Into-Understanding/dp/141690977X) to that effect written within the last 10 years, and plenty of similar sentiments out there. That particular book was co-written by a man, who was more or less the face of its ideas in interviews that I've read. I say this to assure you that this isn't something that specific women are doing to men because they think things are better this way. This is a cultural norm that's communicated to both men *and* women, by both men and women. So for me, when men complain about having to pursue as if this is some decision I've made for them, I get a little frustrated and probably a bit defensive as well.

I think it's something that is changing, but it's most pronounced in areas where other gender/sex norms have changed already. The women I know who can actively ask men out without any backlash also run in very liberal/progressive and sex-positive circles in general. My friends are fairly liberal, but I still see lots of stereotyping of women who pursue too aggressively (note: the threshold for ""too aggressive"" in this instance appears to be very very low).

You also have to understand that even in subcultures where women almost never ask men out, those women are still doing *something.* The women I know who just sit and passively wait for men to come to them are also the women I know who constantly complain about being single. Women who don't ask men out still flirt, start conversations, meet people, show interest, etc. That's all acceptable and even encouraged in any dating advice I've ever read in my life.

To guys who feel trapped by it, I'd say I sympathize but I don't have much advice for them. They can do their part to stop people from encouraging women to pursue, but other than that this is one of those things that's going to take a while. In the meantime, I'd mostly advise them not to get bitter, and maybe contain their personal complaints to other men unless they can present them in a neutral way that won't make their female friends feel like they're somehow at fault for a widespread cultural norm."

I believe a parent should show their children the world and let them get dirty experiencing it. Let them succeed or fail and learn how to deal with the fallout of both. Be honest with them when they aren't good at something but do it in a way that encourages them to try harder. Don't shower them with compliments but make the compliments you give them meaningful. Teach them how to set goals for themselves. Parents need to teach their children how to fight for what they believe in and stand their ground when the world tells them they're wrong. Our kids should know that judging other people before we know their lives can rip relationships apart. I believe parents should teach their kids how to listen and how to be heard. Communication is the heart of everything we do. Everything comes down to how we talk, or don't talk, to each other. 

Most importantly, I believe parents need to show their kids what love is and how respect and compassion are such an integral part of any relationship regardless of its nature.

PokesHoleInCondoms,videos,1389050069.0,"You wouldn't do shit in this situation, so who are you to call them cowards? /u/timaz did a good job outlining why armchair Rambos like yourself are deluded:

http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1uhv3r/xpost_from_videos_man_stabs_woman_on_street/

""You can be Bruce Lee to the N-th degree and 99 times out of 100 you'll end up very dead. This is why you hit first and hit hard the minute someone puts their hand in their pocket because if you miss the draw and someone pulls a knife- you get the fuck out of there or get dead. No one leaves their arm out there for you to go all Kung Fu on like the movies.
Highly trained guys can't do it without a chair (or similar shield) and preferably a baton. We've seen other Liveleak videos from China of up to a dozen other bystanders get stabbed for being nearby.
Knives require almost no physical energy, rarely miss and don't run out of bullets. Chinese psychos routinely rack up numbers rivaling their gun wielding Western counterparts. They are so simple that we discount their deadliness.
The basis of the widely accepted 21ft rule is that knives are MORE dangerous than guns at close quarters. So unless Internet Ninjas think bystanders should also rush a guy with a Glock then no one has any business complaining about them not getting pointlessly stabbed.
All this being said the police who finally showed with a baton were clueless as fuck. Batons are not for pointing at a knife wielding subject to tell him he's been naughty. They aren't for pointing at all because with the exception of the Monadnock AutoLock Baton they are friction lock- if the subject steps forward aggressively into a pointed baton it will probably just collapse in on itself. You certianly can't effectively strike or block from that position. First strike should have been to the wrist to get him to drop the knife followed up with hamstring strikes to ground the subject.""

""Okay- so you want to wrap a nice, easy to grip handle about your wrist. Which the ""asshat"" totally won't just do the natural thing and grab it so he can stab you repeatedly in the face without you being able to back away or get your hand back right? So now that you've gone and tied him to you, you can no longer exercise the absolute foundation of any CQC scenerio- controlling range and maintaining positional dominance. Your right fist against his right knife? That should end well.
If you have any more Internet Ninja fantasy scenarios just test it out. There's no need to make it an academic discussion. Find a friend, give him a magic marker, wear a white t-shirt, try to take it away. If you want a real nightmare try it with a small, fast teenager- it will cure you quickly of any illusions you might ever have about knives and what they can do to you.
Knife defense fantasies are easy to test- and have been tested many times, by many people who's profession it is the figure this stuff out. This is why police don't just wear forearm bucklers or similar dumbshit to deal with knives. Because the bad guys always ""attack you wrong"".""

""As I said- ""can't do it without a chair""
China does not have ""chairs all over"" they have little plastic or thin tube metal stools which would do absolutely nothing. Have you ever trained with a chair or stool? I have. They are big, unwieldy and slow. You get one (slow) swing that anyone can just step back for- then they step in and stab the shit out of you before you can back swing. Or they can just grab one leg and the leverage will keep you from moving the chair. A child can do it. Go pick up a chair and swing it as fast as you can- see how slow it is? See how hard it is to chamber for a second swing? It takes one hand to stop your two handed swing- leaving the knife hand free to open you up.
You are Brazilian- even though the Gracie's teach classical knife defense they are the first to tell you NOT to try it. You will not find any credible CQC instructor who recommends knife disarms.
The problem is you don't actually have any clue what you are talking about or ""what works"". You're an Internet tough guy. You are the same sort of moron who pipes up ""just poke him in the eyes"" or ""just kick him in the balls"" because you have an overactive imagination and no training or practical experience."""

drsfmd,Albany,1389050654.0,"Even with the tax hike, that's well under $1000 per resident total. Far lower than most municipalities. 

Taxes in NY are out of control across the board... I have a friend who lives in a $200,000 home in Alabama, and his combined school and municipal taxes are less than $1,000 per year-- and their schools outperform the Albany City Schools. 

And we wonder why our young, educated people are leaving for greener pastures in droves. "
LeeTaeRyeo,conlangs,1389050657.0,"There is a drawback to the use of ""parent"" instead of ""mother""/""father"". What about names that are used by both men and women? Does ""parent Sam"" mean a father named Sam or a mother named Sam?

If you are just concerned with not having noun gender, there are many languages that do not have it, yet still differentiate between gender in vocabulary (Hungarian does not have grammatical gender, but it has words for 'mother', 'father', etc.).

What is the story behind your conlang? If it is supposed to be a natural languages for some people (or aliens), then they wouldn't know about chromosomes. If the speakers are aliens, is it known that they use the same XX/XY chromosome system as us Earthlings?

As a final note, you might also ask this over in /r/QueerConlangers. They can probably help with ideas and feedback for your gender system (they discuss LGBTQ+ ideas in conlanging there). I'm sure that /u/shanoxilt would love to discuss this system in detail."

itsjusttoored,socialskills,1389050683.0,"Well, in a lot of places, randomly approaching people is seen as a weird thing to do. The best way around it is to utilise the context you are in to break the 'introduction' barrier.

Say it's pouring down, and you have an umbrella. You see someone you'd like to meet who doesn't have one. Asking them if they want to come under yours is a great way to start conversation. Offering someone help if they seem frustrated with a certain task. Asking someone who looks hot and sweaty if they'd like some of your water. That sort of thing."
twelvis,short,1389050695.0,"While there's nothing wrong with being honest, the problem with your strategy is that you're giving women reasons to reject you instead of giving yourself opportunities to connect. A person can easily say ""uh, no"" on a dating site for a thousand reasons. It's very shallow to begin with. You're also likely filtering out women who have a *preference* for height (i.e., they are willing to date shorter men but are searching for taller men online), which is the overwhelming majority of women, in your overzealous attempt to filter out heightists. In other words, you're casting a net too narrow. 

Women are and can afford to be incredibly picky online. Seriously, I've known women who will turn down great guys online simply because they like a TV show she doesn't like. Of course, if this comes up IRL after she's already established rapport, she's unlikely to really care.

Give yourself a chance for others to give you a chance! *If* you met someone who made disparaging remarks about your height, just leave. You can't predict what people will do."

I'd say around 40% of the men I see on a daily basis are attractive. I'd call about 1-5% of the men I see on a daily basis actually ugly. The rest are just kind of uncategorized.

As for men I'm actually *attracted to* in the sense that I actively desire to be with them at that very moment...that's pretty rare based on nothing but seeing them, but it happens once in a while.

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389051035.0,"Are we talking quality now or development costs? Because as much as it would cost to let's say create separate cut scenes for let's say two different styles, it would still be cheaper than two completely different games that would then potentially sell less. 

Asset reuse is treated like a dirty word here but there is situations where it does make sense. Like, ok, we made elven and dwarf models because those show up as villains, we might as well let the player play as one. Or we came up with a magic system and made animations for magic and swords, we might as well let the player use both. 

And there are certain scenarios where you might still yearn for a different approach, but it's completely a-ok if 90% of the rest of the game is the same. Because 90% the same only matters if you replay. If you play only once and see it as the 90% game being customized a tiny bit to make it just a tad bit more enjoyable to you personally, all you do is experience a full game and just or at least more the way you like it (aka as a honorable sword wielder or as an angry mage). There is no reasons why you would have to design all enemy encounters anew when a lot of the story would still totally make sense if you play it as a mage or as a fighter or whether you say ""**** you!"" in the beginning of the fight or ""By the king's honor!"".  "
BadVogonPoet,Parenting,1389051043.0,"Some examples of how I've used this concept with my 16 year old son...

He was in the kitchen with me as soon as he expressed an interest as a toddler. The kitchen offers an amazing opportunity to teach not only cooking, but math and science as well. My kid isn't a gourmet chef by any means but he's comfortable in the kitchen and has been taking care of his own breakfast before school since 7th grade or so. 

We had some issues with bathroom habit that left me not wanting to wash his clothes (no medical issues, just laziness) so doing his own laundry came at a very early age (around 8 or so). I supervised, of course but as a teenager he's completely self sufficient when it comes to laundry. 

School work - I'm aware of his assignments and have good relationships with his teachers but at 16, he's the one in control of his high school career. He's got a 10pm bedtime but his time before that is his own. My expectation (clearly communicated and agreed upon) is that his homework and chores will be completed before bedtime. It's up to him to manage his time. 

I'm not going to be around forever. Hell, in a couple years my kid is going to be an adult and he'll be on his own. I'll always be his Mom but I'd consider myself a failure if he wasn't prepared to face the world by himself. "
Futurecat3001,news,1389051044.0,"Marriage *isn't a right*.  How many times do I have to say this.  Marriage is a set of benefits extended by the government to sanction a certain type of social organization.  

That's what you are missing here.  There are tax and other benefits associated with being legally married.  We get to vote on that.  You can say ""I'm married to so and so"" without the govt benefits all you want.  I don't care at all.  But if you want to have your marriage legally recognized with all the attendant benefits, it has to conform to what society has deemed to be an acceptable social structure.

And you *keep* missing the point I made above.  What I was saying is that courts deciding to invent brand new rights is undemocratic.  That could be the right to marriage, it could be animal rights, it could be a right to browse the internet with no cookie tracking.  I don't care *what* the right is, I care that an unelected judiciary has no business determining new rights that were never passed in a law.  That's the province of the legislative - to make laws that define what we can and can't do.  I chose an incendiary example w/rt animal rights because I imagine most non-militaristic vegans would agree with me that the court suddenly deciding such a right existed would be undemocratic in the extreme.  The point isn't that the specific right in question shouldn't be determined by the courts - it's that NO RIGHTS should be determined by un-elected, un-accountable judges.  We have representatives to pass laws for us.  The whole democracy thing."

That means I have spent 24-28 weeks of my life exhausted, nauseous, with boobs that hurt when I so much as breathed and vomiting spells that were as sudden and grotesque as those in *The Exorcist*. I was also bitchy and prone to crying jags that were epic. *And that is all 100% normal.*

I function as a guide in online groups of newly pregnant women, and of the hundreds of pregnant women I have met, maybe 3 could have improved their 100 yard dash time while in early pregnancy. The rest of us were praying no one could tell we were suffering the effects of hosting a parasitic life form. Because it's like being in the movie Alien.

Edit: I love my two parasitic life forms, don't get me wrong, I love them more than anything in the world. Pregnancy is just a very, very bizarre experience."

LolaRuns,truegaming,1389051398.0,"Eve Online gets cited as the main example where the players started forming a genuine economy and ""quests"" arose from that naturally (like let's attack our enemies and steal their stuff or let's infiltrate them). 

I kinda doubt it would work in a more traditional MMO setting. Like if you gave players the power to create quests and distribute XP they probably fear that too many people would use that to farm the system. 

Neverwinter I think has a system to include user created mini scenarios but I don't know how those interact with the main XP and Quest system. 

I believe Dark Souls 2 is experimenting with the idea of drawing players in to act as bosses for other players. "

anti_skub,AskMen,1389051460.0,"Of course its subjective but now I wonder if you are being intentionally obtuse to reality for the sake of argument.  Anyone paying attention certainly can't deny the media's influence in that sphere.  It isn't easy as them ""picking"" for you as the exposure and influence is more subtle than that.  Additionally, if you are correct in your assertion that the only place to showcase that standard is via media then it should be even more obvious.                            

I can't say that its what *you* may prefer per individual subjectivity but what *people* prefer as a general trend is noticeable, tangible, and real.  The media isn't in the business of throwing out random hooks and hoping one sticks - they pander do the masses with the widest net possible.                        

I'd wager easily over half of the people considered ""beautiful"" and represented as such be it magazine, television, film, etc are white.  The rest who are not, a large percentage of them have features that stand out among the white group.  How many black women with their natural hair do you see represented?  How many with extremely dark skin?  Quite a small percentage versus those who are not.

Also, infants delivered vaginally tend to have a better start for their immune system since they are exposed to the bacteria (good kinds) while coming out of the vaginal canal. If they are removed via c-section they are exposed to a different set of bacteria that delays the population of those that are most beneficial. "

Rather casually, I asked him what he did, expecting the short answer or just working out. But he started talking about these here calories and sites he used to track his intake. Suddenly, an hour had passed, and my head was filled with knowledge, and my heart with determination. 

I went home and threw out everything in my fridge. The next day, I started my own journey. That was 9 months ago, and I'm down 50 kg. I still have about 25 more to go, but there is no stopping me!

**qualifications**

Get rid of that first sentence it's meaningless. Utilizing should become utilized.

**technical skills**

Unless these are extremely important and requested for that position, get rid of it. Almost anyone these days can use word and powerpoint.

&gt; Using Excel to generate a list of 10 bloggers

Change to used.

**experiences**

If what you have listed truly are relevant experiences, keep them. Otherwise, it would be better if you could delete some (I am specifically questioning the teaching jobs) and shorten your resume to a page over all, it could be better.

**cover letter**

* If you can find the name of the hiring manager, do it.
* If that hiring manager is going to recognize the friend's name that you dropped, keep it, otherwise, it won't help you and it will just seem like you're name dropping.
* ""align great**ly**""
* You are regurgitating your resume a little bit in the second paragraph. Highlight only the most relevant and important points you want to make, so that you can make your letter a little shorter overall.
* Indent last paragraph
* Don't say ""you hope."" Just say ""I can be an asset..."" it sounds a lot more confident."

hylandw,DnD,1389052460.0,"A neutral act would be to put him out of his misery. Thus, you are doing good but in an evil way. This specific situation does not allow a true neutral act.

Another example works better.

You see a drunkard passed out in an alley. His purse is loose, coins spilling from his belt. A good character helps him. An evil character robs him. A neutral character keeps walking.

Some say neutral is impossible - all you can be is half good, half evil. These are heroes - no hero can be neutral. Everyday people are neutral. The whole idea of a hero/villain is that they are good or evil. A TN hero would just be a city guardsman who is good at his job. He would not be a ""hero"", but rather an especially gifted character who delves into dungeons. You require some reason - money isn't enough - to take a quest. An evil character does it because he is malevolent, and a good character does it because he is benevolent.

Another thing is that a neutral hero is fundamentally broken. The only neutral thing that could motivate a character is to return things to normal. A good character improves, and an evil character worsens. No neutral character would go slay a dragon, unless he was given a whole lot of gold and was already fully qualified. It's just too much trouble. If a dragon destroyed his city and took it over, however, it would be perfectly neutral to train from level 1 to level whatever to fight this dragon - because it means taking back your home, which is beneficial to you.

It's possible to write up a neutral character, but they're kinda assholes. In theory, a neutral character wouldn't even continue his quest if it was too hard or he wasn't paid enough. It's better to play a generally good character who has slip-ups, or a good character who does evil things sometimes, than it is to play a neutral character.

TL;DR: Neutral characters aren't really any good. A good/evil character is better. At least then they have the motivation to pursue a quest."

btw. I can live with the whole ""I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you either"" thing, because you know personal flairs just like all the other different choices for villains etc.

Another thing is how he goes in retirement after rachel and harvey died. Holy fuck that is stupid as shit. Any batman would use that to drive himself even harder, but noooo. He needs to retire and then the fuckface manages to do something bad with his leg while doing NOTHING.

It is supposed to hit the single digits tonight and while I have earplugs and headphones to drown out the barking, I'd rather the dog not suffer just because his owners are abusive and inconsiderate trash."

The zoo probably won't care that you were in yearbook club, for example. But it sounds like you are very young and if you don't have the experience, then you don't have it. It looks fine otherwise.

Your cover letter is where you're going to have to shine to make up for your lack of experience. Don't talk about why you're qualified. It makes you sound entitled, passive, and apathetic. Speak to why you want the position. Some random points:

* Don't mention your grades. If you're trying to illustrate that you did well in those courses, just say you did well. 
* Don't mention that you're a first semester junior. No one cares, and they can deduce that from your resume.
* I liked the last sentence of the second paragraph, and the second sentence of your first paragraph. Probably the best sentences there, and your whole letter should mirror that type of tone and content.
* Again, don't say you're qualified. It's a weak statement.
* Overall, the cover letter needs a lot more passion and needs to convey *why* you want and deserve the position, not just why you're qualified. Almost anyone is ""qualified"" for an internship, but not everyone deserves one. Your resume outlined you as an individual, now fill in the colors with your cover letter."

I mean, Yuto Nakano isn't bad, but this is one of the performances where I think the dub isn't just a suitable replacement as with most dubs, but actually beats out the sub for me.

lazybarista,AskWomen,1389053130.0,"Well, what response is he expecting from saying that? 

Man: yeah, women expect men to be the active pursuer a lot of the time. 

Woman('s ideal response?): Okay.

And a lot of times when guys say that, they're completely ignoring women who don't have the luxury of waiting and being approached, or women who have gotten negative, sexist reactions when they do approach.

There is also the sentiment from these guys that women just ""wait around being approached."" Er no, it doesn't work like that. I've never pursued a guy, true, but if I just ""stood around waiting to be approached"" I'd be single and without sex forever. I have to groom myself to societal standards, be social and engaging, be appropriately flirty and responsive when interacting with attractive guys, and give off the vibe that I'm interested. That isn't just standing around. And this is where a lot of women fail and end up single, so it isn't a cakewalk on the other side.

Yes, I still think it's upheld that men pursue and women be passive (though in the artsy hipster circle I came of age in, nope. Most relationships sprang from drunken hook-ups initiated on the dance floor). To guys who feel trapped by it: Why? Why do you feel trapped? Romantic and sexual relationships are optional. If you want one, play by the rules. We all do.

If what you're currently doing isn't working, change it, That goes for women to. If being passive doesn't work, you're going to need a different approach. Believe it or not, there *are* men who get pursued and women who either pursue or stay single. "

dirtyewok,coys,1389053187.0,"There are a couple things about Shane Long that i think have resulted in him being linked to us.  

First, his contract is up in the summer meaning he would be cheap. His wages are very low as well. 

Second, he would be moving up to a bigger team (read more money and more success) and would be brought in specifically to be the 3rd/4th striker and he is a hard working, head down and work type of player means you shouldn't hear bitching from him about playing time. He has PL experience for a team that has nowhere close to as much talent as us so he knows what to expect in league and may get better service.

Third, he's a bit different type of striker than we currently have on the squad. He's bigger than JD and about the same height than Soldado. He has decent pace and isn't bad at holding up the ball. More importantly....he's one of those constant running strikers that is constantly darting between defenders and pressuring the ball deep. Simply put...he's an annoying shit to defenders which does have a place in the world.

Long while not exciting is one of those moves that is almost no harm to the team if you make the move especially since he would be cheap. Not a sexy signing, not a guy that the fans are salivating over, not a guy who sells shirts, not a guy who you will ever expect to bang in 20...just a hard working guy who knows his place and can do enough of everything well enough to be a burst of energy and usefulness off the bench.  

Don't know that i would really want Long, but i actually wouldn't be overly upset if we landed him either.

Would prefer we chased a striker who in terms of development was a bit more advanced than Kane but still in that 18-21 age bracket that you can develop and just let him pair with Kane as the 3rd/4th striker. 

That said, i am actually not expecting us to sign anyone.  If we do i would almost expect a loan of a veteran unless a great deal fell in our lap.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1389053324.0,"Because thus far education through the internet has proven to be a terrible idea for new learners.

Massive online open courses (MOOC's) in the parlance only seem to work particularly well for one group of people: People who are already educated in an area but who are trying to enhance their skillset.

So imagine you went to school for 4 hours a day, came home, then had a MOOC for 2 hours of the material you sucked at.  That might work.  But purely online is terrible.

Teachers do a lot for personalization of material and individual attention - or at least they are supposed to.  There are certainly places that isn't the case.  

A big part of any education is the legitimacy, you have to evaluate material and someone  looking at that evaluation has to trust that it was legitimate.  With exclusively through online material it's very hard  to know for sure that the person doing the work is the one you're awarding the marks to.  It would be all too easy for an american kid to pay 5 dollars a week for some kid in india to do his homework for him. 

Kids need to learn socialization.  It sucks but in the real world you have  to deal with all sorts of people.  When you got to university or college you have a particular selection pressure of being surrounded by a bunch of people who all share at least one interest.  That's a bit of a reality distortion  bubble  - the real world you have to deal with people  with all different outlooks and skillsets.  I have spent so much time in universities I'm in the habit of calling everyone over 30 ""Dr ...."", even though people with PhD's are a fairly small subset of the population as a whole.  

Working from home is actually really really hard to do.  There are lots of distractions, and lots of ways to not be doing the thing you're supposed to.  When you're in school teachers are supposed to minimize other distractions, and you sit there and you pay attention and do the work, if nothing else but because you're so bored and there's nothing else to do. 

In some countries a school lunch is the only healthy meal you can count on a kid having.  

School is more than just learning to do the test material.  Although that's the core central focus a lot of the time, a big part of public education is to make sure everyone gets a fair shot at life regardless  of their economic status and home life.  The internet can help some people augment that, but it's not ready to be the primary delivery mechanism.  "

POGtastic,everymanshouldknow,1389053562.0,"Lots of people have discretion to ruin your day.

Yell at your boss? He'll schedule you for shitty hours or just fire you.

Disrespect your parents? They'll ground you and take your car away.

It's not bullshit that people with power over you have the discretion to ruin your day. It's just common sense not to mess around with them. Protect yourself by being polite, courteous, and mindful of your rights. For me, that's saying ""Good afternoon officer"" with my hands at 10 and 2 on the wheel to show that I'm not a threat.

hrtfthmttr,relationships,1389053749.0,"&gt;Sleeping apart was one of the stops on the way to my marriage dissolving entirely. I hear that a lot of ""older couples"" sleep separately, but I would have (and did) try almost anything to not feel like it was a rejection. Eventually I felt exiled.

&gt;The problem is that it's hard to comment since the actual problem with sleeping together isn't explained, it's just that you ""can't"" due to ""different habits"".

No. You are projecting your own failed marriage/relationship here. You know why you felt rejected? Because that was the intent of sleeping separate for you or your partner. You know why it's hard to explain? Because in your relationship, you and your partner needed better communication practices to explain *really* why you were sleeping separate. It's not everyone's fault that you couldn't get the truth, or she couldn't explain it for whatever reason.

I love the intimacy of sleeping together, but I'll be damned if I don't wake up constantly because my partner makes me too hot, no position is comfortable for more than 5 minutes, noise, breath, and her movement. All of that contributes to awful sleep sometimes, and there are plenty of times when sleep is more important--for my mood, patience, and general well-being--than one night of cuddling.

I'm sorry your relationship tanked, but your sleeping habit changes were a symptom of your specific problems, not the world's."

exitingcarisfail,relationships,1389054232.0,"Psimitry is right. I'm a full time college student and working full time at a diner with other college students. We all hate working there and complain about coworkers and customers constantly. That's what having a job as a young adult without a college degree is like. Most people have to earn money to get things they want. College isn't for everyone and some times they see after a few years of being out of high school that they actually want to go to college to make something of their lives. But school is something you can't force.

As a girl, I can 100% agree that we get hit on no matter what. There are nights that I have been out at the local bars with my boyfriend and the two of us be walking home and kissing, but I still be asked by other guys if I wanted to go home with them. Most guys are of the type that they want what they can't have or there's the thrill of the chase. You just need to chill. You seem very immature and this relationship seems like it isn't going to last. You're way too insecure and she isn't mature enough to be working and earning money.

Also don't knock the food places. I bet you eat at chain restaurants often. You have no understanding of how difficult or draining working in food service industry is, until you've done it. I highly recommend it though. It makes you grow up in the first couple months of working there, because it shows you that if you don't have a degree, that is pretty much you're only chance for employment. Also if you pick some degree that is of no use in the job market, you will be stuck jobs that you think are below you. I personally don't think either of you are mature enough to make this work.

I hope when you both go to college or whatever you plan to do in the future, that you can have the chance to grow and broaden your horizon of how the 'real world' truly runs."

Mongoosen42,vegan,1389055892.0,"I would also like to point out that being an ""Omnivore"" does not mean that it is healthiest to eat meat. In fact, most omnivores are much healthier on a vegan diet.

You may have learned that the egg is the ""perfect protein"" because of it's particular combination of amino acids. This comes from experiments in which rats grew fastest on diets of meat and egg in particular was discovered to have the combination of amino acids that caused the most rapid growth. From these experiments, meat protein, especially egg protein, was declared to be the best. What most people don't know is that when these experiments were repeated many years later, it was confirmed that rats grew the quickest on meat diets, but that when the experiment was carried on for a longer period of time, they also died sooner than the rats fed a vegan diet.

The truth is, being omnivore only means that you can survive long enough eating meat to have children, that any negative side effects of doing so are delayed until a point in life where it does not have a major effect as far as natural selection is concerned. That does not mean that  omnivores are just as healthy on either an animal based or plant based diet.

In numerous experiments the vegan diet has been proven to be healthier in almost every level. Vegans have a vastly reduced risk of heart disease and stroke, cancer, diabetes, and osteoporosis, conditions that result in more death and hospitalization in the elderly than every other form of illness or injury combined.

Your post is in regards to the moral argument for veganism, so this response might be considered a bit off topic. But I think that a lot of non vegans think that the ethical argument is the only one that matters to most vegans, when the truth is that for many it is not the primary motivating factor for choosing this lifestyle."

**Function:**

Phyrexian Metamorph - It's anything and everything, in any colors, for *cheap*. Definitely my favorite card function-wise, pretty good art too.

Ohran Viper - so dang efficient, cool card that not many people know about. It always at least 1-for-1s, which is hard to come by in green. Either they trade a creature with it, spend removal on it (while I drop my real threat next turn) or it bites them for some card advantage, sometimes multiple times. Plus, its a snake with *antifrost* for blood. 

**Flavor:**

Ob Nixilis, the Fallen - So cool. He's a planeswalker-turned-demon because he lost his spark. Not much known about him, very cool concept. I hope he comes back in a later expansion.

**All Three:**

Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker - There is never a time when I'm not excited to slam him down against my opponent. One of my favorite P1P1's in my cube, so fun to build around and end games with.

Well, I think the objective was to pick your all time favorite card... and as usually is the case, I couldn't narrow down my favorite card so I just went with all of them. Damn I love MTG."

Technically that's wrong because I know for a fact that the Bristol Downs league is outside the pyramid, but yeh. The English football league system (and most football league systems, the only one I personally know of that doesn't follow this model in some way is MLS for various reasons) is structured into separate but connected leagues that you can be either promoted or relegated (or neither) from, depending on where you finish in that particular division. 

It is technically possible to go from the Mid Sussex League Division 11 (the lowest rung I can see) to the Premier League via 23 promotion seasons but it's never going to happen.

Because there is such freedom to move it means there is more room for teams to come into being. Possibly. It could be the other way round ie so many teams came into being that the system was forced to become the way it was. But football has always been a very local game, so you'd play for and support your local pub team, which would then grow into a larger team, and so on."

She might not be limiting you because she's trying to be crazy or controlling. It's far more likely that she's lacking in self confidence and insecure about her sexuality. If I had a boyfriend when I was younger, I probably would have been intimidated by knowing my boyfriend masturbated. (Don't worry guys, I've grown up!)

Take some time to talk to her and explain that it's your body and masturbating does not affect your intimacy with her or your feelings for her. It's a sexual urge and she can't always be around to fulfill all your sexual needs. Be firm, be kind. If the conversation isn't headed in a healthy direction, then break up with her. Give her a chance to understand your perspective, and hopefully lead her to change her attitude. Even if you guys end it, at least explaining your position will give her something to thing about."

I believe the traditional cut of meat to use for that preparation is shank, which is really cheap and has a ton of connective tissue (probably why it's so cheap).

duckduck_goose,OkCupid,1389057107.0,"OP: It might for you be exclusivity in an unspoken sense. For example, you have a great date with Barb and decide to pause any other dates until things mature / expire with Barb. That's fine if it works for you.

The rub is that Barb might be having a great date with you, with David and with Paul. She could be having the same sexual encounters with all three men. It might be, in her mind, like tasting samples at the ice cream shop until she decides who is the best match. In her mind you're not just seeing her exclusively as she doesn't share those same values.

One thing I learned from both this sub and dating is *not everyone will share your unspoken values*!! One thing I learned in 2013 is never agree to go against your own value systems unless you want to have a real bad time.

So what I did recently was to not assume. I told the person straight up, ""I am not interested in, currently seeing nor seeking out other dates until I see where things go with you here."" Sure it's a gamble but better to make it early on than keep waiting until you feel like they're on the same page. By early on it's whenever your value system might clash with theirs which in my case is also when things get sexualized."

I think you are confusing the layman's or colloquial meaning of ""theory"" with the scientific definition. In science, a theory is an idea that has been proposed and tested rigorously enough to be considered as factual as science ever gets - the theories of gravity, quantum mechanics, and special relativity, for example, have been used to make astoundingly accurate predictions, and nobody's yet been able to come up with an experiment in which that these theories fail (leaving aside things like black holes, which are both quantum and relativistic and we aren't yet able to explain). The casual meaning of ""theory"" the way you're using it is more accurately ""hypothesis.""

The mind is a powerful thing. If you believe something will happen, then your mind has a way of fooling you into perceiving it happening.

That's why we do scientific tests, with controls, with groups testing different methods. That's why tests are designed so the subjects can't inadvertently influence the results. 

When my husband was in the hospital, I was on high alert for phone calls from his doctors and nurses while I was at work. I can't tell you how many times I could have *sworn* my phone vibrated in my pocket, but there was no call. 

I do not believe that old phone to be spirit-posesssed. I still have it in a bin of toys for my nieces. It never rattles, never vibrates.

Chances are, my brain was playing tricks on me. 

It is FAR more likely that your mind was playing tricks on you that *one time*, rather than an entire unexplainable spirit world exists and a spirit inhabited the planchette you were holding for no discernible purpose other than to scare the bejesus out of you.

Look, go ahead and believe, but people are suckered into the Jehovah's Witnesses because they set aside their critical thinking skills. If you don't sharpen your ability to test reality and perceive the difference between ""likely"" and ""unlikely"", ""possible"" and ""impossible"" (or ""Implausible""), then you're susceptible to falling for some charlatan in the future.

Daiteach,Thetruthishere,1389057554.0,"The library's original collection had been donated by a librarian in the state of Rhode Island in the United States, and the library was named after her. We used her name for a lot of stuff around the library; the magazine subscriptions, for example, were addressed to her. At some point, somebody (not me) decided that that was the ghost's name, too. It's hard to find much information about her, since she has a pretty common first and last name (there's apparently a famous witch trial victim with the same name), but since she was in an important enough position to make a large overseas book donation to a new library around the middle of the century, she appears to have been active in high-level  Rhode Island state library stuff starting in the late thirties through the early fifties (based on Googling) and because you rarely name buildings after living people, she'd almost certainly been dead for a while by 1999 or so when this all went down. The most likely obituary I can find puts her date of death at 1979, but it's a sparse one so I don't know if it's really her. That's early enough that the library could have been named after her before I was born and before most people I know would have remembered it.

Another possibility, if you're into ghost-based theories, is that that the island was the site of a WWII battle, and hundreds of American and thousands of Japanese soldiers died on the island or nearby.

I have no idea how ghosts are supposed to work - I don't really think the spirits of the dead haunt the living - but under a ghost-based theory, I'm more inclined to go for the first theory, since the ghost(s) sang along in English in an unaccented (to me, an American) adult woman's voice, and very few American women served in active combat during WWII. On the other hand, it did sometimes look like multiple figures were present through the shelves at night, but that whole party might be an optical illusion anyway."

dewprisms,relationships,1389057576.0,"&gt; Then she should have asked him what do you think of our future, not ""marry me or leave me"".

We really have no idea how she said it, and he could be exaggerating or feel pressured because she simply brought up that being married is very important to her and he needs to make a decision. Laying your cards on the table is not the same as giving some ridiculous ultimatum.

&gt; Just because she wants marriage it doesn't mean he's ready for it. It's pretty obvious OP loves his girl but there's a lot of things about her he doesn't like hence his he doesn't know what they will be like 10-20 years from now.

*No one* knows what they will be like as a person or a couple 10-20 years from now- this isn't an excuse to flee from commitment.

&gt; JUST BECAUSE HE DOESNT WANT MARRIAGE IT DOESNT MEAN ITS A DEAD END RELATIONSHIP AND IT DOESNT MEAN THEY NEED TO BREAK UP.

If she *does* want marriage and he doesn't, then yes, it IS a dead end relationship. Those are two fundamentally opposed desires.

&gt; And if she is forcing him to do something he doesn't want - something as big as marriage then how does that look on her?

There's no forcing. He can just decline to do it and end the relationship, or she can end it if he says he doesn't desire to get married. Again, saying ""I want X, and we need to talk about if you don't"" isn't the same as ""OMG marry me right now or I'll ruin your life and it's over 4eva!"""

The other thing that TDD easily lends itself to is Continuous Integration (CI), where you have regular runs of all your tests (which also lends itself to Integration Testing and Acceptance Testing).

TDD also does something incredible to your code, it makes it readable. To make a huge function in TDD, you will have impossible tests to write with crazy setup and won't test a lot (too many conditions). It will force you to abstract stuff to smaller, more readable parts to test. This usually also means better use of design patterns, like factories. 

The last thing I will mention is that if you use TDD you can limit scope creep because if there is not a reason for a test, you will not have a reason for code. In our shop we also use a bit of BDD (cucmber) for our Acceptance Tests of business needs. The code itself has unit tests (nunit) for the parts to the acceptance tests. In our case, the Acceptance Tess is driving the unit test, the unit test is driving the code. No waste, no discovery code, because when it comes to writing code, my only goal is to make the test pass.

&gt;Is one way better or worse, or are they just different?

They are just different, and while I think that TDD is better, I am sure some people would argue with me. It partly depends on your product. I work on larger projects where a time between releases can take more than a year, partly because the customers have no desire to constantly upgrade and partly because we have large  teams of business analyst that bring in large stories that can take months to complete. It is critical that in those months of development I don't break other packages. Tests will let me know if I break something enhancing old code. If you are working on a small single page app that you can knock out in a few hours, can easily manually test, and the complexity is not so great that it is unreadable, then TDD might take too much time and effort to be profitable. Every coin has at least two sides."

Pit_Sweat,explainlikeimfive,1389057904.0,"&gt;it's really a combination of two things. It's part respiratory biology and part of it is physics, or thermodynamics. One of the main functions of the nose is to warm and humidify the air that we breathe so that when it reaches your lungs, it's nice and conditioned. And in order to do this, the nose has to add some moisture to it.

&gt;When it's very cold out, the air is usually dry as well, and the nose is really working overtime to add some fluid. And there are reflexes that are in place that allow the nose to increase its fluid production. And if it really makes a lot of fluid, then it starts to run out of the end of your nose.

Tazato,anime,1389058077.0,"It's been a big week of backlog diminishing for me. 

***Evangelion 1.11 and 2.22*** : these two were interesting, because I watched the origanal series a very long time ago and don't remember it all that well. It's clear they changed some things, but it's also clear that the overall themes were kept intact. 

***Spice and Wolf [5/25]*** I watched the first five episodes, and love it so far. I really like the interactions between Lawrence and Holo, it's one of the most natural feeling relationships I can remember. Really looking forward to watching the rest of it. 

***Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! [12/12]*** I started and finished this series to continue my slight obsession with KyoAni shows, and it was honestly the best on I've watched yet. I can't get enough Rikka and Yuuta, hopefully the second season doesn't screw with perfection too much, it was one of the best endings I've ever seen in an anime. [Chuunibyou](/s ""I cried at that ""sayonara papa!"" not gonna lie."")

***Hataraku Maō-sama [13/13]*** *(The Devil is a Part-Timer!)* I don't even know how it happened, but I literally watched this one straight through yesterday. I normally don't marathon shows, and I didn't intend to with this one, but ~6 hours later it was done. And I don't even know if I liked it. [Hataraku Maō-sama](/s ""It was really really funny from start to finish, but sometimes it felt like it wanted to be more serious then it really had business being. And sometimes those serious bits were really dramatic and impactful, but then would be totally blown off and not talked about again. There was that emotional confrontation where Emilia confronts Satan over the killing of her village, the theft of her childhood and the death of her father, but they get interrupted and Satan says like ""sorry LOL"" and that's the last we hear of it. I think it really should have gone one way or the other, because the comedy was really funny."")

redsekar,gaming,1389058614.0,"The original hebrew text has the name written out, but the vowels are a bit ambiguous, because ancient hebrew didn't have any written vowels.  Modern hebrew usually doesn't include vowels for ordinary writing unless it's ambiguous without them, but scripture pretty much always includes them ([they're the dots and other marks above and below the consonants](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Aleppo_Codex_Joshua_1_1.jpg)), including on YHWH, but they purposefully put the vowels for Adonai (""lord"") instead of for Yahweh to remind you to say Adonai instead when reading out loud (also, writing it in full is considered bad, though not as bad as saying it, I think).

The modern best guess for the vowels (Yahweh) is based on indirect evidence, like words that were said to rhyme with YHWH and names that include parts of the word.  Amusingly, ""Jehovah"" derives from an assortment of fuckups.  Firstly, some of the earlier non-jewish research into the correct pronunciation assumed the Adonai vowels were correct, and that Vav should be pronounced with a V (the ancient jews almost certainly pronounced it as W), and then english speakers reading the research (pretty much entirely german) didn't realize that germans pronounce J as Y.  It's always amused me that Jehovah's Witnesses place a lot of importance on calling God by his proper name, rather than just calling him ""God"", but apparently don't particularly care about calling him the *right* name."

thedictatorscut,MakeupAddicts,1389058668.0,"I picked up the Too Faced A Few of My Favorite Things palette in the fall and I've used it a lot. I always had a weird perception of Too Faced as ""stripper makeup"" - perhaps since I do have a few stripper/ex-stripper friends who all *love* the brand - but that palette is really nice. The darker colors were a little hard to work with at first, but the lighter colors and neutrals are so nice, and the Chocolate Soleil bronzer is actually a perfect brow color for me, somehow? (I'm way too pale and cool to use it for its intended purpose.) "
Avistew,polyamory,1389058676.0,"To answer your second question, I would say find someone you're interested, ask them out (or say yes if they ask you out), then say you believe you're polyamorous and see if they want to give it a try or want to be monogamous.

If they do want to be monogamous and you think you should give it a try, then go ahead but tell them it might very well not be for you. If so, end the relationship early enough, so that it's easier.

Before you're in a relationship seems a bit early to wonder if you should try monogamy. For all you know, even if you find a poly partner, neither of you will have anyone else when you start dating, and neither of you will for a while. So you'll get experience having one partner who only has you as a partner, that way."

dewprisms,relationships,1389058874.0,"There are different types of ""ultimatums"" that I already mentioned and you conveniently ignored it so I'll just move to the next point.

You can be just dating and committed, but marriage confers legal benefits to your spouse that you cannot get otherwise without jumping through major hoops, and even then sometimes there are ways to dissolve that or at least impede the rights long enough for them to not matter anymore.

I don't think a relationship is dead if after 2 years someone doesn't want to get married... *right away.* What I am saying is that if it's been that long and he's still hemming and hawing about the idea of marriage *in general* he should let the relationship go. I doubt she wants to get married tomorrow- she probably wants some sort of timeline to know it will be happening in the near future and that they have concrete plans they are working on together.

I highly doubt it's being told no to marriage *right now* that is something she ""can't handle"" - it's the uncertainty of the future and him not providing anything concrete. But if you've been together 2 years and you still can't see yourself marrying someone, and that other someone *wants* marriage, you need to let it go for both of your sakes, really, unless the other person is okay waiting indefinitely for a change of heart.

It doesn't sound like the OP doesn't want marriage ""yet"" it sounds like he doesn't want it at *all* and is uncertain if that will change in the near future. It's best for them *both* to end it, so he doesn't rush into something he might regret just to hold onto her, and so she's not sitting and waiting and hoping he will come around."

Anecdotally, it sure seems like once you get past the second round, picks at any position are unlikely to do much in the NFL. Once you get to the 5th round, unless you're drafting a special teamer or maybe an interior OL, you're basically taking a flyer, and the QB numbers reflect that.

When Belichick was explaining why they took Brady where they did, he said that they just got to the point where Brady was by far the highest rated player left on their draft board, to the point that they felt compelled to go best player available even though they weren't looking for a QB and didn't even necessarily need one. 

In other words, Brady wasn't drafted to be a franchise QB. He was drafted because he was better than the other guys who were left available at #199."

Lower the bass output and the cone excursions are less and the speakers survive better, plus are cheaper to make.

Back in my day Kenwood was not considered first rank.  I built my own Dynaco amps from kits which now are sought after but the hot stuff was Mcintosh.

Daiteach,community,1389059467.0,"I think that the Hunger Games thing was partially a victim of the episode's promotion suggesting that's what sort of an abortive throwaway joke and an excuse to get Jim Rash in a funny costume in the context of the episode was an actual theme of the episode, but it's still an example of the show not really living up to previous seasons' use of parody elements. Nothing about The Hunger Games books or movie, stylistically or thematically, is reflected in the episode. If the dean didn't announce that the episode was doing a Hunger Games thing, there'd be almost nothing to connect it to the franchise at all. It's a deployment so sloppy, so pointless, and so half-hearted that it's hard to even consider it a real theme episode, especially when the show drops several unrelated genre parodies (which are done substantially better and with something like a real point) in the middle of it.

The Shawshank b-plot at least commits to some of the stylistic trappings of what it's referencing, even if it's not to much end. The pairing with the Jeff-reunites-with-Dad plot was a weird tonal decision. You have one plot that's trying to mine humor by giving a pretty minor and silly negative circumstance the trappings of a serious drama, while the other plot is trying to play one of the shows biggest mythology moments, from a drama standpoint, largely straight. You have a plot that's asking us to take the characters pretty seriously as real people in order to make the drama work alongside a plot that's parodying drama. (And worse, the ""serious"" plot has way more laughs in it.)

The Shawshank plot doesn't work because it's so nonspecific. It's not a love letter to what it's parodying like most of Community's parodies are, and while it's not as completely superficial as the Hunger Games parody, it doesn't make anything of the connection, like the good community parodies do. It starts with the premise that being stuck at a friend's house for Thanksgiving where you don't fit in well and are sort of uncomfortable is like being in prison, but doesn't go anywhere from there. There's no further connections drawn, nothing else is mapped from one situation to the other. They do stuff you might do in a garage, and Abed narrates it, because we're doing a Shawshank thing apparently. The best moments in the plot (""Why did I have to go third?"") have nothing to do with the prison conceit at all."

redsekar,gaming,1389060490.0,"&gt; Like anything, Judaism changed over time. God had a name, but at some point, people decided that to say it is sacrilege.

Interestingly, this came about as a result of the commandment not to take god's name in vain.  There is a doctrine called Chumra, often translated as ""build a fence around the Torah"", where if a rule is in any way ambiguous you should stay the hell away from anything that might be interpereted as violating it.  Since you can't always tell if a given use is ""in vain"", you should just never say it, just to be sure.  Eventually this became a rule instead of a guideline.

The ""no meat and dairy at the same meal"" thing comes from something similar.  There is a commandment prohibiting boiling a kid (young goat) in its mother's milk, which was regarded as kind of adding insult to injury.  Well, if you didn't personally do the slaughtering and milking, how do you *know* which goat the milk came from?  Best just to not mix goat meat and goat milk.  Somehow that got generalized into not eating, say, goat meat with cow milk.  Then, in the middle ages, it got further expanded so even eating them at the same meal got included.  Because of food particles remaining in your teeth, one rabbi advised that you not even eat them both on the same day.  To avoid accidents, another advised that they not even be placed on the same table."

Girdon_Freeman,WritingPrompts,1389060595.0,"The underpopulation. The rampant crusty socks. That was what the world had came to. Not with a last bang, but with tons of virgin whimper. 

It started many years ago, with a rebellion amongst the angsty teens of the 2010's. They were sick and tired of the world's bullshit, so they decided not to do any more schoolwork... or anything but sit in their teenage bedrooms and masterbate all day. 

I was the one that started it. I thought that having sex with my hand was more important than the task at hand: doing my homework. So, in a fit of teenage impulsiveness, I decided to forgo the latter to literally do the former. My parents grew quite irate with me, calling the police over this minor occurrence. Some twat posted me a video of me being hauled into a police car while I screamed to my parents how much they were assholes for not letting me masterbate on Youtube.

The video got 300 million views... within the first four hours of it being posted. Everyone and their grandmother had heard my rage, and all the teenagers and their younger siblings had heard it too. 

So thus began the White Times. 

With everyone pleasing themselves, no-one replaced the old folks that grew the crops, or the people that tended to the elderly, or did much else but eat Doritos and look at porn all day. 

I had began this movement, and now, since I had learned from my mistake, I had to stop it. 

My climax had come. 

I appeared in my bathroom, my room in sight. On the bed, a recently-pubescent me lay, an antiquated, smuggled Playboy in my hand. 

""NO!"" I yelled out. I punched my younger self in the face, causing his hand and the playboy mag to go flying. He jumped out of his bed and hastily arranged his member.

""Who the hell are you?"" I remembered yelling, as I heard it yelled right in front of me. 

""My savior?"" I answered/remembered. 

""No. The world's savior,"" I said, as I jumped out of a window and into my parent's backyard. Expecting a time portal, I ran into a tree, then passed out. 

When I awoke, I was in the future, resting in a hospital named ""St. James."" 

The first thing I realized was that I was in a hospital, surrounded by people. The second thing I realized was that the world no-longer was populated by crusty socks in a 10:1 ratio to humans. 

I had started the revolution, and I stopped it before I even finished. "

dewprisms,sex,1389060660.0,"Make your hand into a C-shape but keep your 4 fingers straight. The thumb goes into the vagina (it's short so it hits the g-spot almost perfectly, some adjustment may be necessary.) The area just below the fingers (so where your knuckles would be, but on your palm) would rest just above the vaginal opening, likely touching the clitoris. Probably not the entire length of your hand would touch. Fingers would rest over the mons.

This could be done with the woman on her back but that would require some positioning on the male's part because it may be awkward to have their arm held like that with palm facing downward and be able to continually provide stimulation.

Often one or two fingers are used inside and the thumb is used to stimulate the clitoris. It's basically just flipping where the fingers go, and obviously it's the palm on the clit and not fingers since they're too long.

So if she is laying on her stomach, the fingers would be, at least partially, between her pelvis and the bed."

And it does matter- there are differences in exes. Considering his age, he really should understand that high school relationships aren't typically meaningful, especially when it's just that ""we went to the movies and our moms picked us up and we went home"" kind of thing.

&gt; Who's to say that something physical won't happen now?

Well, for one the friend has a long term girlfriend. If she was going to cheat she could cheat with virtually any man regardless if he is an ex or not. Also that would mean he doesn't trust *her* in any way, and it has absolutely nothing to do with her exes- it's about her being around any men that she has any past with whatsoever, or any single men. Which is really absurd and controlling.

This is like locking up Rapunzel in the tower. ""Oh sweetie, it's not *you*, it's *them!* which it total crap. The whole notion of ""I trust you but not others"" makes no sense and, frankly, is a way to say ""I don't trust you"" but without being willing or able to admit that.

I raised my sister most of the time, but she's since ended up in foster care and juvie, for running away, doing marijuana and cocaine and stealing, among other things. I moved an 8 hour drive away the week after I graduated high school, and limited contact with her for four years. I went back for a few days over Christmas with my friends, thinking I could put the past behind me. She bought my friends presents and put on a mother of the year act, and they totally fell for her glossed over version of the past, where all of my current life's accomplishments are because of her supposedly solid parenting. When she wasn't trying to win an Academy Award for her mommy act she attacked my clothes, my weight and even my eyebrows - of all things.

(note that there's lots of exceptions, and English became increasingly common over time until Norman French died out.

Mongoosen42,vegan,1389061609.0,"Sure, that's a very valid question. 

There are three primary factors that might motivate people to be vegan, and different people might care more about one than the other. Most people only focus on and discuss the ethical concerns. I have just outlined the health concerns. The final aspect involves the environmental concerns. 

The animal product industry, and that includes those animals raised for wool, leather, etc, is one of the greatest, if not the single greatest, driver of climate change. Consuming animal products is not just unethical, and not just unhealthy on a personal level, but is actually destroying the planet that we live on. It wasn't the case for most of human history, but with 8 billion of us, we can't all wear products obtained from animals without seriously damaging our eco system. It simply isn't sustainable. That is why, even if the ethical argument doesn't affect a given individual, they might still be motivated to not only not eat animal products, but to not where them as well.

I am personally pretty equally motivated by all three aspects or ""pillars"" of veganism equally: the ethical, health, and environmental issues are all important to me. It is only for the environmental issue, however, that I would like to see other people become vegan as well."

dewprisms,relationships,1389061749.0,"&gt; Instead of assuming everything why dont we ask the OP, Stop making decisions for him based on what you think he believes.

You should confer the same benefits onto his significant other, considering he provided very little to no details about the situation at hand, especially no direct conversation or quotes. So just like I said in my first response to you, we have no idea how this played out and you're *also* assuming a lot of things about the situation, but only with her in a negative light.

You say it ""sounds like he does want to get married"" but here's a direct quote from the OP. It's the first paragraph of the topic post:

&gt; I love my g/f but I'm not sure I believe in the act of marriage. I'm not religious (my g/f, and both of our parents are) and I'm kind of an anarchist who doesn't believe much in govt and don't see the need to register our marriage to the state.

One last thing you're not considering is that she's 30 years old already. If she wants marriage and children, she does have a limited time frame to do it in. The longer she waits, the more difficult it will be to find someone else to do it with if this doesn't work out in a satisfactory way for them both. That's not to say it's impossible, but it does become increasingly difficult. It sucks, but biology does work against you after awhile.

That said, I won't continue this because you're very blatantly ignoring parts of my posts and the topic post that *directly address* what you are getting all riled up about. You're basically angrily echoing a lot of what I am saying back at me as if I am not saying it, or it wasn't pretty clearly outlined by the OP already."

I think thats what pisses me off the most about law in this country, even if youre innocent it still costs you money.  Source: happened to me.   

A friend of a coworker got pulled over in a tiny speed trap town.  He had a couple of beers, blew a .04 on the breathalyzer... Not drunk.  They had him take it two more times, still not drunk.  Finally they talked him into coming to station - not under arrest, to ""finish paperwork"".  There they breathalyzed him again and he blew a .08 so he was arrested and charged.

Yes, he was able to get the charges thrown out, but it still costed him thousands of dollars in lawyer bills, ect.  The scary thing is that if a cop wants to arrest you, he's gonna find a reason to arrest you, and it costs thousands of dollars of to clear your name.

Some parents don't understand the differences between daycare and dayhome, there can be conflict, it can be stressful.  I was very lucky through some trial and error to find three wonderful caregivers over the years for my older boys.  I'd say the most important thing is to have your method and don't be afraid to tell a parent that it isn't working out.  Conversely, don't take it personally if they tell you the same thing.  

It can be tough being home with kids normally, adding other people's kids makes it harder.  Make sure you've got a game plan with your partner to keep your sanity at the end of the day so you don't feel like you're trapped at work.

I would also recommend that you plan ahead to track your expenses and plan your day home.  Do some research on the tax treatment of home businesses and plan ahead to take advantage.

FeatherDie,relationship_advice,1389062922.0,"I think sometimes we forget that our partner doesn't always know why we love and appreciate them. This is especially true if it not communicated clearly early on in the relationship. He isn't stupid and you're not being wronged if you sit up and say, ""Darling, I love it when you whisper sweet nothings when we cuddle and when you bring me wildflowers randomly because you think I like them. I don't want to demand it, but that's how you make me feel loved."" 

Obligatory statement that reading the Five Love Languages book can help to understand how different people express their love, and how to reciprocate in ways that can be better appreciated by your partner. 

If you communicate clearly your wants/needs and none of them are ever met, time to move on. I think it's a waste waiting around for someone to grow up and be responsible for their relationship. While loving someone isn't hard, showing them that they are loved can be difficult. Humans are cantankerous things.

I hope this helps. I try to keep things fun by remembering that we were friends first before we were lovers. Sometimes it's nice to scrap the libido for a night and just do goofy friend things. It can also ease the tension caused when feelings get bruised. You can be friends right? Who says you can't work out the other issues?"

Penultimatum,politics,1389063029.0,"I hate analogies like these regarding privacy. Just because somebody doesn't have a problem with the NSA recording their phone conversations doesn't mean that they're fine with them taking video of their bathroom or something. The bathroom is reserved largely for **personal** uses, whereas a phone has a much broader range of uses.

I tried thinking of a good analogy, but I couldn't come up with one. So instead, I'll give a scenario in which I would not be comfortable with a roommate gaining certain information, but I have no problem with the government having the same exact information.

I would be very disturbed if I found out that I had a roommate who snooped on my computer and looked through my browsing history. This would disturb me for many reasons, of which I will list the ones I can immediately think of:

* My roommate invaded *my* privacy, targeting me specifically and nobody else (or very few people else, such as perhaps my other roommates). This makes it **personal**.

* My roommate had an ulterior motive which is unknown to me and affects me personally. Their actions are not transparent in the least, nor were they expected.

* My roommate chose to find out this information through an unconventional avenue. If they had a friendly motive, they could've just asked me personally. If they had an unfriendly motive, well, they had an unfriendly motive.

Let's say that the NSA is recording everyone's browsing habits. I'm *not* disturbed by this and I'll say why, in part echoing the reasons I listed in my bullets above:

* The government is recording *everybody's* habits, not just mine. This makes it **impersonal**.

* The government is doing it with a motive I do not consider wholly unreasonable (preventing crime) and it is at least making a show of explaining its motives. Their actions are somewhat transparent (though admittedly not as much as I'd like) and they are expected.

* The government does not have an easier way to record my browsing habits than directly through me or my ISP. They *could* ask me personally, but seeing as they're trying to prevent crime, I would be unlikely to outright disclose any incriminating actions I may have taken. There is little to no chance of their motive being fulfilled in any more comfortable manner.

I do think that the government should be more transparent in the motives for its recording actions and in disclosing what information it chooses to record. However, even disclosing what information the NSA chooses to record is risky. It's for the same reason so many online communities' admins (especially in gaming, e.g. Riot Games) choose not to disclose the particulars of why somebody has been banned. If they release what information they record, there is a potential for criminal activity to occur more frequently again, as now people know which channels of communication to avoid and - by process of elimination - which channels to use for such activities.

Recording is a useful approach for preventing crime, especially in today's information age. I believe the correct approach regarding sentiment towards the government is not to denounce them for recording information on citizens, but instead to denounce unjust criminalization of activities."

I suggest the same to you. Most of the research in to the Laffer curve indicates that the optimal tax rate is around 70%, at which point you maximise revenue. Are you suggesting we up the rates to that level?

&gt; it is possible to have tax rates too high. 

Indeed, but that limit is not 45% nor 50%.

&gt; Higher taxes does not equal more income, especially in this age of globalisation.

Not true. The 50p rate still brought in £1bn in additional income.

&gt; This is why I despair if Labour get back into power. They will raise taxes on the wealthy and businesses as a populist measure, and not only raise less income but kill off jobs too.

Then it's a good thing that it brings in more revenue, and that there is little evidence to support the notion that this kills job creation.

I have a Magic Launch Flight Box and Im not sure what people mean by learning curve. Its pretty simple. Grind your bud finely, load trench, depress battery (don't insult it) and wait 5-10 seconds depending on preference, inhale slowly, release battery and keep inhaling to clear the box, repeat as needed.

Save your AVB and you can make edibles or capsules and get nicely stoned off them.

Back to the oil pen. They are between $80-$150 Mine was around $80 and it is awesome. It has titanium coils which heat up and cool down faster and are longer lasting then steel. the only issue is that you had to either buy BHO, buddah or shatter from a dealer or make it yourself. I make it and it is super easy so long as you have the gear to make it. 

for the bare minimum you will need 2 pyrex trays one that can fit inside the other (thrift shop $5 each)

Honey Bee Extractor (head shop buy $29.99)

razor blade or other scraping tool (cheap???)

Kettle or hot water from tap 

Follow youtube tutorials and voila high quality oil. The only on going cost is cans of butane but they arent too pricey $5 at my local headshop, make sure its highly distilled 3x or more is best

Heelincal,nfl,1389063566.0,"More income generated means growth, and growth is what drives the economic engine. So not only is the NFL making money and the fan enjoying the experience, but the scalper makes money as well. It's only ineffective when the price is too high. But if people are logical they will not buy something for a price that is too high.

The NFL wins because the higher prices means there's more demand for their product. High demand means that people are interested and will buy other products. (Think of it like advertising) The NFL doesn't care what the price is as long as someone buys the ticket. The problem occurs when the ticket isn't sold.

The consumer wins because whoever is willing to pay the price of the scalper values the experience at that price or even more. Logical people *will not* buy something that is overpriced, or priced at a value higher that what you can/are willing to pay. (This is why there's an economic argument in favor of digital piracy being a non-factor in sales... but I digress).

Additionally, as you pointed out, the scalper wins as well.

Now the NFL and consumer have the same result regardless of price in both scenarios - assuming all tickets are sold. But in the scalping scenario more income is generated in society (and the economy) by the scalper. Meaning instead of a win-win, it's a win-win-win.

Scalping adjusts based on demand. Imagine if scalpers had to buy tickets and then sell them - even if the game was awful. If the game had no demand, they would sell tickets at less than face value in order to limit losses - lowering the market price for the game.

It's the reason why 1 Bobcats ticket is practically nothing, and a Lakers-Celtics ticket is hundreds of dollars."

* When you (finally) manage to get laid you remember you're hot shit.

The change doesn't stop though, you're just more alert to it. Suddenly you don't mind seeing her friends. Actually, that one friend she introduced to you still wants to chat, so you might as well. It doesn't really bother you as much as you thought it might. 

Then you see *her* again, it's been a while, but it doesn't bother you. You feel...nothing, it's weird. You're happy when you hear she got that thing she really wanted. She's seeing a guy too - that's fantastic! Moments later as you're walking away you think to yourself:

I'll propose a new question too:

How many people who have been raped decided to come forward on the first offense with no regard whatsoever to the men who are able to physically kill the complainants before trial starts? You think fears like that don't stop women reporting rape? Ask any three women in your life what it was like when they were raped, and be prepared to listen to the one or two who respond. Don't look down on them when they answer, truly ask to hear, and let them know you mean it honestly.

I assure you, one of the three women you ask (over the age of 18, who are willing to talk about it) was probably raped. Even if she says she was not raped.

Most women are shamed into not admitting they were raped. Ever."

If anyone, including myself, was too harsh, I apologize. But is there nothing you could learn from our comments?

If it helps, I used to be terrified of demons and the spirit world when I was a JW. Learning about science, the mind, how it can fool us, and some of the quirks of our living meat-space bodies, eased this terror tremendously. I'm now the proud owner of an Ouija board, in a house that by all rights should be haunted. No supernatural experiences yet…

And no fear of them. I don't have to have the lights on. I'm not afraid of the shadows or the mirror. (the raccoons that roll through periodically are another matter)

So I get that you feel defensive about your situation, but always be prepared to ask, ""does the other side have a point? Why are these people so sure?"" And if you're not satisfied with the answer, just accept that we don't have your experience, so *we don't know*."

Most of the dads I work with regret not taking the max they had available with their first child and took as much as they could with the second.  My husband got 3 days off, it wasn't enough.  I needed him and he basically had 2 full time jobs, work plus the kids and I when he got home.  The guys I work with can take 6 weeks at full pay, the ones that take it are always sad to come back to work and have a lot of (adorable) personal calls during the days for a while.

The biggest thing from my experience is that if dad isn't around long enough while you get your bearings and establish routines it starts to feel more like your baby and not so much his.  Mommies tend to ""gatekeep"" and criticize when dads do try to help and it really can hurt both parents and stop them from bonding with each other, undermine dad's role with the kids and opportunity to bond with the baby and put more stress on mom.

Those guinea pigs have been groomed for the show life since day one. A good American (smooth coated) cavy will square itself off. It's literally described as the shape of a brick. Feet tucked, nose in, crown high. Long coated cavies are shown on specialty [show boards](http://www.jonkimes.com/BlckWhtBoar) which need exact measurement. They are stack-able, and it's hilarious to see little noses poking out as someone carries 4 or 5.

Piss and shit happens, but most judges are fast enough for this to not be a problem.

Check your guinea pigs for mites or lice by lifting up the hairs on her butt, or behind her ears. If you see little white balls on the shafts (that's what she said) of hair it's [lice](http://gorgeousguineas.com/images/lice2-1.jpg). If you see dark bugs crawling on it's light fur, or light bugs crawling on its dark fur (and flaky skin) it's mites. I think both can be cured by **slathering your guinea pig in mayonnaise** and no I'm not kidding. Old breeders trick. 

Some guinea pigs just hate having their butts touched. A guinea pig 'purr' isn't actually a sound of enjoyment. They have little nuances to their noises, and it takes time to decipher them.

I wish more people were more interested in cavies; they are so much fun and people don't give them nearly enough credit. Mine did tricks on command, which is more than I can say for most dogs."

It's an oppressive tempo boost. A card that says ""destroy target permanent"" instead of ""nonland permanent"" turns an almost-always useful spell into an **always** useful spell. The rare moment when your opponent doesn't have any permanents on the battlefield.. they'll still have lands. It always has a use, and that use becomes mana-screwing your opponents out of colors they need or mana they need to play. Instant speed land destruction will not be printed in the foreseeable future at 3 mana, unless ***maybe*** they introduce it as costs three specific colors. And even at that, it would likely be nonbasic land destruction.

But Wizards has already said they don't like printing land destruction for less than 4. There's a reason there haven't been land destroyers for less than 4 in any recent block that didn't have a significant drawback. Think about something like Abrupt Decay. Do you think making it cost W more and removing the nonland ***and*** under 3 CMC restriction is a fair swap? Not likely.

It's something Community would do, but it would do something with it, rather than just kind of coasting on the idea that a puppet episode is enough of an idea on its own.

b00tler,beyondthebump,1389064905.0,"My partner (she's mommy, I'm mamma) has breastfed our 9 month old since birth and HATED pumping.  When she was pumping and we were trying to feed the baby breastmilk from a bottle during the day, I was fairly anxious for her to pump, and wanted to see how much she came home with, because I was anxious about running out of breastmilk during the daytime (or during some of my partner's overnight absences for her military service).

When we decided to phase in formula and phase out pumping, it ended up being a huge relief for both of us. I had an easy, assured food supply for the times my partner was away, and my partner got free from the damned machine.  Her milk supply adjusted so that she could breastfeed first thing in the a.m., as soon as she got home from work, and again before bedtime, without having engorgement problems during the day. 
I wonder if this isn't part of your husband's motivation here? 

As far as your husband insisting that you pump so that the baby doesn't get any formula, I would make sure he is educated about:

1) the fact that you can maintain breastfeeding even if you eliminate daytime
pumping

2)  exactly how unpleasant pumping is for you (you may not be a ""complainer"" but he needs to understand this, so give him the details of it)

and 

3) the fact that formula supplementation is routinely done, safe, and healthy for your baby (in fact, after 4 months, it is beneficial because it will help maintain the baby's iron levels).

Bottom line: you are not a personal in-home dairy and if pumping makes you feel crappy, there are ways to eliminate it (as a routine) while still maintaining your breastfeeding.  Because it is your body and your time, I also believe your husband needs to give a LOT of weight to your preferences in this matter.

winged_venus,TwoXChromosomes,1389065071.0,"Exactly.  I would like to invite the OP over to /r/BDSM and /r/BDSMcommunity so that she can get an understanding of the people who engage in this type of sexual dynamic, where we consent even if there is pain or discomfort.  There are a number of possibilities that can be at play in a dominant/submissive relationship where pain or discomfort is present by modified consent.

* Some of us find a very narrow line between pain and pleasure and physical pain and discomfort is part of what we enjoy.

* some of us like to be dominated emotionally and mentally, with the giving up of control for our sexual experience.

* some of us like the fantasy of being forced to do something we 'don't like' with someone we trust to take us through such a deep and intense experience, and push our boundaries in a safe environment

* some of us want to do things we don't like, JUST to please the other person, or be made to do them.

So there are a lot of reasons a man can wish to dominate and want to participate in anal even if it causes pain, and there are women out here who are more than happy to have it done to us this way, because of our corresponding sexuality that meshes with that.  I realize that it can be a frightening prospect to people who don't understand it, but I hope you all try, that we engage in such acts after a huge amount of communication and in an environment of deep trust to keep it within our creed of SAFE, SANE and CONSENSUAL.  

BDSM requires deep and constant communication, and a level of trust with your partner that is difficult to imagine.  A man who has these desires as part of his sexuality, shouldn't be shamed for them, he knows he isn't going to find what he needs with non-BDSM (vanilla) women. He'll find what he wants among the BDSM women.  Trouble is, he may not know what to call it, what he is looking for.  he likes anal, he likes the idea of dominating a woman into it, he likes the idea of degrading her.  Well, we're out here, and even if you don't understand it, don't look down on us.    

The fantasy of forcing is a valid sexual fantasy for both men and women.  BDSM provides a safe, sane and consensual environment to explore these of our darkest or deepest fantasies.  
Socially speaking, BDSM is where homosexuality was about 20 years ago.  More people are now aware of it, the mental health professionals are beginning to recognize it as a legitimate and natural sexual orientation and lifestyle rather than a mental aberration, and we are starting to request tolerance and equal rights and protections from laws that make what we do illegal, but we ALSO do need to not have people go 'that's disgusting' about dominant men, dominant women, submissive men or women, or switches (people who like to explore both.) 

Submissives want to be forced to do things (as long as its someone we trust, as long as we set up guidelines to work within, and as long as its safe.)  This is their sexuality.

Dominants want to force people to do things. (as long as they can trust the other person, as long as we set up guidelines to work within, and as long as its safe.) This is their sexuality.  

When you find each other and mesh, it is extremely deep and profound.  Imagine someone paying so much attention to you, and knowing you so well, that they can read the tiniest of your body signals.  Imagine someone you can trust to stay within your limits without a single doubt, how freeing it is to give your body over to them so they can do wonderful, terrible things to it.  And you just ride the wave.  

Imagine being the dominant, and feeling the profundity of your partner's absolute trust, and the gift of them saying 'I want you to do what you want to me'.  And all you have to do is stay within the pre-negotiated limits.  The communication level of BDSM is incredibly deep, as is the trust.  But the physical experiences kind of spoil you for vanilla sex forever after. 

If he wants to 'dominate' and act out his fantasies of degrading a woman, and cause her pain as well as pleasure, send him my way and I'll point him to BDSM so he can understand what to do with his fantasies, safely.

If he wants to really force a woman who he doesn't know and he doesn't want to set up boundaries ahead of time, and isn't interested in learning what he'll need to learn to act out deep, dark sexual fantasies in a healthy way, then yep, he's a dick.

Jess_than_three,AdviceAnimals,1389065080.0,"Right, but the purpose of a word is to communicate. If the vast majority of the populace understands the word ""vegetarian"" to mean ""a person who does not eat animals"", then if you choose to use that word to mean ""a person who eats fish but doesn't eat any other animals"", then you're communicating poorly, and you're going to be misunderstood a **lot**.

Now, if you want, you can certainly try to make an argument supporting the idea that your usage of the word is better or more useful than the pre-existing one, and hope that if others agree your usage will gain currency; but I can't see that ever working in this case.

TL;DR: Yes, if you say ""vegetarian"" but mean ""eats fish"", you're doing it wrong."

I have a step by step process for addressing smells, do as many steps as required to get the desired result.

1. Regular wash and dry with your standard unscented products.  Don't use the gentle cycle, it doesn't agitate enough to really get things clean.  You've got to use at least a little heat in the dryer to get the full effect.

2. Second wash, add vinegar and a little extra detergent.  

3. Third wash, presoak in vinegar, line dry in the sun until fully dry, rinse, and machine dry.  ALTERNATELY if you are like me and can't line dry, store for 2-3 days in front of a window that gets at least a few hours of sun, laid out in a clear container with a box of baking soda.  Follow up with a regular wash.

If that doesn't work you're probably screwed BUT make sure that you are double checking your lint screen and washers to see that none of the old fragrances or detergents are soaking out of the clothes and back into them during the cycles!  Run a cleaning cycle with bleach in the washer or run towels through the dryer in between to help dissipate the scent coming off the clothes.  Heat helps get the stink out, but hot water and high temperature dry cycles will also cause the clothes to shrink and fade faster so use caution based on how desperate you are! "

Our first date was the day after Valentine's Day, an attempt to make things less awkward, to go meet up for coffee in the morning. Just something chill. We really hit it off and just drank coffee and hot chocolate while talking for 8 hours straight.

We were young and had no money and we're starving at this point. I ask him if he wants to grab food from my house with me. Well, my whole family was there and he met everyone and has supper with my parents. 

We still really hit it off and went out after dinner to meet up with some of his friends for more coffee. One of his friend's younger sister asks what my intentions were, if I planned to marry him, etc, it was brutal. I just a laughed and turned bright red.

Finally, to end the night, I drop him off and we are still talking til 4 or 5 am. This date was almost 24 hours. Anyways, while we're talking I'm thinking, wow, I think I might marry this guy. I didn't want to say it because I knew that it would be creepy as hell. But, he blurts out ""I could really see myself marrying you.""

Chaos_Spear,sailing,1389065799.0,"I would very much love to see you try to bunt up a sail before casting the sheets.  Even with the halyard down.  Preferably, I'd be on another boat, yelling at you.

* Unless you have a *very* oddly shaped sail, you will NOT be able to raise the foot of the sail to the level of the yard with the bunts, while the sheets are still made.  I think you might be confused as to how low the yard actually goes!  
* Second, by hauling on the bunts before rising the sheets, you're going to continue capturing the same amount of wind, but now you're putting inordinate stress on the lizards and thimbles.  You're liable to rip the whole thing apart, assuming the bunt doesn't rip your hand to pieces!  
* Lastly, lowering the halyard(i.e. clewing down) is the slowest part of the sail take.  You're going to take up more time without any gain in safety!  Casting sheets and clewing up gets the wind out of the sail FASTER than lowering the halyard.  Not to mention, once you've clewed up, THEN you can bring the halyard down until the yard is in its lifts.  Then, IF your crew is skilled enough to go aloft in such conditions, or you're stupid enough to make them, you can sea-stow.

EDIT: Oh, and I forgot: Clews are usually designed with more purchase than bunts.  Gives you a huge advantage."

Acceptable levels of domestic violence? Think about that statement.

&gt; Sending Timmy to stand in the corner works only so much.

That isn't the only form of punishment. Parents need to consider that maybe something else is going on. There are always different solutions. Just because one tactic failed doesn't mean that domestic violence wins by default.

&gt; Fear is a very basic instinct.

You are seriously arguing that we use fear as a means of raising a child. That is completely psychopathic.

&gt; And when you fear your parents there are just certain lines you will not cross.

You shouldn't fear anyone and certainly not your family members. Can you see the cognitive problems of trying to both use love AND fear to get your way? Children should respect us, which is why they behave not fear us. We can use threats of violence to make anyone afraid of us, but is that conducive to how they view us? Do they really want to help us or listen to us? Only because they fear the ramifications?

Most importantly, your theory is completely flawed because it makes a glaringly obvious assumption: that the parent is always right. Some parents are indeed crazy. Some have mental problems and emotional issues and drug abuse problems, maybe a history of sexual abuse. Should we trust those individuals with the right to use violence against defenseless children? Also, what standard are parents using for instilling discipline? Oh that's right, its subjective. One kids misbehaving is not considered bad by a different parent. Oh, that's right, because its subjective. One kid would get beat for the same offense another kid would not. So what is the yardstick we measure physical punishment? Should we codify it? Maybe determine how many slaps per offense? Then it changes with age. We decide the body part to harm. Then we train parents in how much force to apply. Then they get beating licenses. There are no standards, so who are we to decide that beating up a defenseless kid is the solution to a problem?

&gt; Love your children but inspire enough fear in them that when you say you mean business they know you do too.

You sound precisely like the psychopathic God of Abraham. You are writing ""love"" and then ""fear"" in the same sentence and applying that to children. Think about that. Could we use that logic with any other relationships? I hate to strawman, but I cannot come to you and say ""Love your wife/co-worker/dog/mother, but inspire enough fear in them that when you say you mean business they know you do too."" If those scenarios are unacceptable, then why is hitting a child perfectly okay?"

It's often easier in a social setting to just let the ""small stuff"" go than to create a scene, because like /u/Cenodoxus said, you tend to get labelled if you stir the pot for that kind of stuff as a woman. It really sucks for both sides.

&gt; The idea that me trying something and a girl just letting something happen out of fear scares me. I don't want to do that to anybody.

There's a few ways to avoid it (nothing is guaranteed, but it's usually sufficient): read body language and other social cues to see if they're okay with it, and communicate. A lot of people whine and argue that it takes the spontaneity out of the situation, that it's awkward, or it's ""unsexy,"" but asking permission is a pretty solid way of making sure something is okay, *especially* in more intimate situations.

You may inadvertently do this a few times. Often it becomes clear eventually that it wasn't intentional, especially if it's not a pattern of behavior.

dewprisms,changemyview,1389066501.0,"Someone else posted it elsewhere in the thread and I'm having difficulty finding it now, but statistically only about 1 in 1,000 women are stronger than the average man. Even if you are lean, you have more muscle mass than the average woman, and you also have significantly higher upper body strength. Unless you have a condition that weakens you or you only hang out with female body builders and MMA fighters, this isn't going to be true. **Edit**: statistically yes there are outliers on either end. You theoretically could be a man who is weaker than many women. On average for either gender, this is not the case.

Many men often underestimate how much stronger than women they are- you may be surprised how easy it would be to overpower most, if not all, of your female friends."

**STOP COMPARING BEGIN SHORT TO BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AS IF YOU WERE SOME OTHER RACE, GENDER ,SEXUAL PREFERENCE OR WEIGHT.**

do you know why? because they do not compare. stop comparing things that are not the same.

whats its like being discriminated against as a short person? being discriminated against for being a short person.

no parallels need to be drawn, no analogies need to be made. just say it for what it is.

if you want to make an analogy to help people understand, ok but do not use one to prove a point.

I had a companion who was super into deep doctrine And science fiction (a bad BAD combination), and all of this ""life is intelligence, intelligence is eternal, it cannot be created or destroyed,"" and all that stuff came up one day. If intelligence can't be created, where did the intelligence that we are created from come from?

We came up with a pretty awful theory by the end of the day:  heavenly mothers are never discussed; maybe women who ascend into godhood don't become rulers, but their ""intelligence"" is broken down and becomes the stuff that creates the god seeds that grow into new spirit children. Dude, they're like celestial compost, man. Whoa...

At the time it seemed super plausible and depressing. I knew that the church doesn't talk about stuff that they don't want you to know about, so my working theory for the longest time was that ""heavenly mothers"" have a fate in store for them that isn't worth discussing on earth. :("

Heelincal,nfl,1389066770.0,"Theoretically it could. This isn't a black/white thing. Economics is a lot of theory based on the assumption that people are rational 100% of the time (we're not, obviously).

The idea is that the price finds *exactly* the demand it needs.

For example, say there are 8,000 tickets available for the Denver game this weekend. There are *millions* of people who would go to an NFL Playoff game for $1. Obviously this isn't the best price. But for $100, there are only about 500,000 people who would want to go the game. That's 492,000 people who will be really disappointed, since they would have paid the asking price to go to the game.  
Now say the price is $400. That might mean only 10,000 people would pay for the tickets. The price keeps going up until (theoretically) only 8,000 people would be willing to pay the asking price for the ticket.

Does it mean that the most money possible is spent? Not necessarily. But the most efficient outcome is theoretically achieved.

You're definitely right that your average Joe might spend more money in the stadium on gear, food, and other discretionary items. It's not all black and white, but scalping should (in general) achieve the most efficient outcome for the *economy as a whole.*

Does that mean average Joe doesn't get to go to a game? Some of the time, yeah. That's why the NFL focuses on the TV aspect so much. If people know games are super expensive, they are going to want to watch TV. And they'll watch ads. And buy beer. And buy jerseys anyway. And might buy a ticket in the future.

Hope this is helping to answer the question."

Did it work?"
CalBearFan,OneY,1389067481.0,"As others have said, just don't do it! It can't be undone and what happens if you meet the girl of your dreams and once you finally work up the courage to tell her you slept with a hooker and bammo, she heads for the door. Yes, even if a woman truly loves you she may leave at that point.

And let's be perfectly candid. Given how 'pent up' you say you are, it will probably last all of a few minutes if even that. And I doubt it will really release anything, just make you want more sex. Yeah, it may feel like a release for a little while but sex is full of chemicals that act like drugs which means you'll want more.

And don't even get me started on what creepy crawlies a lady-of-the-night may have. Not everything can be blocked by a condom.

All in, it's just not worth it and you may live with regret for the rest of your life, all for just a few minutes pleasure. Save your money, go buy a new video game or something. Go for a run, whatever.

Honestly though, it sounds like you may just miss having a girlfriend and who can blame you. I'd spend the money getting some new clothes that make you feel like a million bucks, attend a dance class (those things are full of women) and basically invest it in something that will lead to a long term relationship, not just a quickie because you feel like you'll burst."

libraryhobbit,AskWomen,1389067518.0,"I assume you are not counting play-fighting/sparring in martial arts/stuff where physical contact or striking is not considered malicious. Its weird, within these situations striking someone is not a big issue for me - because like there are boundaries and its for fun/sport - people are not in danger, out side of these I am a super pacifist. 

As it were, I have been assaulted by men, and I hate it but I am a good fighter when trapped [of course, if I can run I'm gone]. I hate causing pain [participating in martial arts competitions and practicing with full contact - I know how much shit hurts] but in a situation where it is defense I feel nothing but the desire to cause as much pain and disability as I can, no remorse. I feel sick afterward. I hate that I have to do this to defend myself, and that I have the potential for causing such pain. I feel nothing but vague disgust for the people who have attacked me, hatred would mean I cared.

Otherwise I kicked my bro in the balls once when I was 8, he was being mean to me and I was done with that, got a long talk about boundaries and retaliation from my parents and had to apologize. "

dewprisms,bestof,1389067596.0,"I know your comment is a few days old, but I wanted to leave a couple of notes:

&gt; My longtime girlfriend said a lot of things about my lack of ability

This is horrible and mean to do to someone. It's one thing to say ""Hey, X isn't really doing it for me. I think we should work on it together, or could you try Y instead?"" or ""I saw someone try it this way in a video, let's see how it goes."" There are so many ways to bring it up that are more sensitive and considerate that cause productive growth in a relationship.

&gt; not having a big enough penis for her.

Granted some women do have a preference for large penises, but typically when someone makes remarks like that it's because they're trying to be hurtful to you. Again, it wasn't about being constructive, it was about being mean and tearing you down.

&gt; If someone who actually cared for me could say that, 

If she really did care for you, she wouldn't have said those things. That was horrible and mean, and chances are most partners wouldn't act like that. Unless you have a micropenis, you're fine. And even then, there are people out there who are into a ton of different things, so you wouldn't even be without hope in that case.

&gt; I never had a girlfriend until I was 24, and I just felt bad about being bad at sex.

My SO and I had little to no experience (just awkward fooling around a couple of times when we were younger before we met, no real sexual relationships) until we got together, and we were both 24. Neither of us were great at it but we learned and got better. I know it's bad to tell someone how to feel or not feel but I can't think of another way to phrase it off the top of my head: you shouldn't feel *bad* for inexperience. It's not some sort of willful action on your part. 

Don't give up hope. Remember you're worthwhile and you're worth loving just like everyone else (except like, Hitler or something, but you get the point). You just have to find someone who loves and respects you just as you love and respect them. Your ex, from the very brief info you gave, frankly sounds really fucking rude and clearly wasn't that person."
